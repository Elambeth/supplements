      "abstract": "Mastitis is an important disease of the mammary gland in all kinds of lactating mammals, endangering the development of animal husbandry and human health. Apigenin is one chemical constituent of Taraxacum and Philippine Violet Herb which are effective Chinese herbs for the treatment of mastitis. It is reported that apigenin possesses anti-inflammatory activity and other pharmacological effects. However, the attenuation of apigenin on mastitis has not yet been reported. The present study investigated the protection of apigenin against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mastitis in SD rats both in vivo and in vitro. The results suggested that apigenin relieved the lesions of mammary tissues induced by LPS, decreased mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines:tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Simultaneously, apigenin reduced the increasing content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) induced by LPS. The results showed that apigenin was able to attenuate the LPS-induced mastitis in rats by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro, which provides scientific references for further research."

      "abstract": "Mitochondria provides adenosine triphosphate for multiple vital movements to ensure tumor cell proliferation. Compared to the broadly used method of inducing DNA replication arrest to kill cancer, inducing mitochondria damage to cause energy shortage is quite promising as it can inhibit tumor cell bioactivities, increase intracellular accumulation of toxic drugs, eventually sensitize chemotherapy and even reverse drug resistance. Breaking the balance of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents have been proven efficient in destroying mitochondria respectively. Herein, apigenin, a GSH efflux reagent, and 2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine 5'-monophosphate sodium salt (FdUMP) that could induce toxic ROS were co-delivered by constructed lipid nanoparticles, noted as Lip@AF. An immune-checkpoint inhibition reagent CD276 antibody was modified onto the surface of Lip@AF with high reaction specificity (noted as αCD276-Lip@AF) to enhance the recognition of immune cells to tumor. Results showed that the redox balance was destroyed, leading to severe injury to mitochondria and cell membrane. Furthermore, synergistic DNA/RNA replication inhibition caused by inhibiting the function of thymidylate synthase were observed. Eventually, significantly enhanced cytotoxicity was achieved by combining multiple mechanisms including ferroptosis, apoptosis and pyroptosis. In vivo, strengthen tumor growth inhibition was achieved by αCD276-Lip@AF with high biosafety, providing new sights in enhancing chemotherapy sensitiveness and achieving high-performance chemo-immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aggregation of α-synuclein (SNCA) in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite years of drug discovery efforts targeting SNCA aggregation, no disease-modifying drugs have been approved to date. The failure of numerous clinical trials can be attributed, at least in part, to the difficulty in identifying potent compounds during preclinical investigations. OBJECTIVE: Establish a screening approach based on molecular docking and autophagic flux detection to identify natural compounds from new perspectives of SNCA clearance and to explore its mechanism. METHODS: Molecular docking technique combined with autophagic flux detection was performed for preliminary screening of flavonoids in PubChem and CHEBI databases. Western blotting was utilized to detect the levels of SNCA, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-associated proteins, apoptosis-related proteins, and neuroinflammatory biomarkers, alongside the assessment of phosphorylation status of proteins implicated in signaling cascades. JC-1 staining was used to measure the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP). RNA-sequencing and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes/gene ontology (KEGG/GO) analysis were optimized to detect gene expression. PD mouse motor function was assessed using rotarod, pole, open field, footprint, and gait analyses. Immunofluorescence staining was employed to detect the expression of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), dopaminergic neuronal deficits, microglia activation, and production of inflammatory factors. LysoTracker Red staining and pSIN-PAmCherry-KFERQ-NE plasmid were used to evaluate the lysosomal activity. pHrodo™ Green E.coli BioParticles™ were employed to measure phagocytosis activity. RESULTS: By molecular docking and autophagic flux detection, we evaluated the efficacy of flavone derivatives and identified apigenin (AP) as a candidate that activates CMA to promote SNCA clearance and thereby inhibits SNCA-induced neurotoxicity. AP inhibited apoptosis by promoting SNCA degradation through Nrf2-mediated CMA activation. Moreover, AP could also inhibit apoptosis via the Nrf2/extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) feedback loop that operates independently of CMA activation. Additionally, AP enhanced the phagocytosis capabilities of BV2 cells and inhibited SNCA-induced neuroinflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: AP activates CMA to promote the clearance of SNCA, thereby inhibiting SNCA-induced neurotoxicity. Nrf2 and its role in AP-mediated neuroprotection may provide new insights that target degradation pathways to counteract SNCA pathology in PD.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by a significant imbalance in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), shifting from anti-inflammatory M2 to pro-inflammatory M1 phenotypes, contributing to chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. This study explores the potential of nanoparticle (NP)-mediated immunomodulation to address obesity-related inflammation, adipocyte browning, and metabolic dysfunction. Apigenin (Api), a natural compound with notable anti-inflammatory properties, was encapsulated within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs (Api-NPs) for localized delivery to adipose tissues (ATs). Api-NPs demonstrated favorable physicochemical properties and sustained release profiles. In vitro, Api-NPs, increased M2 macrophage (MΦ) polarization, reduced inflammatory markers, and promoted adipocyte browning. In a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mouse model, Api-NP administration effectively modulated MΦ polarization and enhanced AT browning, leading to marked reductions in body weight and AT mass. Our findings indicate that Api-NP treatment mitigates obesity-related inflammation and promotes beneficial changes in AT composition and function. Importantly, histological evaluations confirmed the absence of toxicity in major organs, reinforcing the safety profile of this approach. These results position Api-NPs as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for obesity management, integrating immune modulation and localized drug delivery to address the complexities of obesity and its associated inflammatory processes."

      "abstract": "Bladder cancer is a major global health concern with high incidence and mortality rates. Both muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and recurrent non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) present significant challenges in treatment. Apigenin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has shown promise in inhibiting the growth of bladder cancer cells, however, its therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis and drug target screening were performed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and potential therapeutic targets of apigenin were identified. Molecular docking was utilized to evaluate the binding affinity between apigenin and VEGF-β. In vitro assays were conducted to evaluate the association of VEGF-β and apigenin. Drug target screening identified 51 common targets between apigenin and bladder cancer, with VEGF-β emerging as a dominant gene. Molecular docking confirmed a high binding affinity between apigenin and VEGF-β. VEGF-β was significantly upregulated in fibroblasts from recurrent bladder cancer, correlating with increased tumor malignancy. Enhanced cell communication in VEGF-β-positive fibroblasts contributed to tumor progression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that VEGF-β promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Apigenin significantly inhibits bladder cancer progression by targeting VEGF-β. The upregulation of VEGF-β in fibroblasts from recurrent bladder cancer highlights its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target. This study underscores the promise of apigenin as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent for recurrent bladder cancer.",

      "abstract": "Apigenin is a flavonoid compound found in many fruits, vegetables, and medicinal herbs. It possesses a wide range of biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective effects. Some initial evidence also suggests that apigenin may have antiseizure properties. In this study, we aimed at providing more insight into the potential influence of apigenin on seizure susceptibility in mice and its influence on parvalbumin and GABAA receptor immunoreactivity (PV-IR and GABAAR-IR) in the hippocampus. We also assessed the pharmacokinetic profile of apigenin after intraperitoneal route of administration and its possible side effects. Acute administration of apigenin, at doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg, significantly increased the threshold for various types of seizures, i.e., the myoclonic twitch in the ivPTZ test, the 6 Hz-induced seizure, and hindlimb tonus in the maximal electroshock seizure test. A 14-day treatment with apigenin at a lower dose of 50 mg/kg also increased the threshold for maximal electroshock-induced seizures. Pharmacokinetic profiling revealed a very slow elimination of apigenin from serum, and even slower from the brain, after intraperitoneal administration. In consequence, a relatively high accumulation of this compound in the brain can be expected. In addition, apigenin given repeatedly increased the mean number of GABAAR-IR and PV-IR neurons in hippocampal fields suggesting its potential influence on neuronal Ca2+ metabolism. This study indicates that apigenin has a relatively minor effect on acute seizures in mice. However, modifying the quantity of GABAAR-IR and PV-IR hippocampal neurons provides further support for the neuroprotective effects of apigenin.",

This study investigates the potential protective effects of Apigenin (AGN), a bioactive flavonoid, against BPA-induced PCOS-like symptoms in adult zebrafish. The research aims to explore the therapeutic potential of natural compounds in mitigating the effects of environmental endocrine disruptors. Zebrafish were exposed to BPA at a concentration of 10 µg/L, a level known to adversely affect aquatic organisms. The non-toxicity and efficacy of AGN were assessed through a dose-response study involving concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 µM. The experimental design was informed by computational molecular dynamics, including docking and simulations targeting the human androgen receptor. The study involved histological staining of ovarian tissues, biochemical assays for antioxidant enzyme activities, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for BPA accumulation, and gene expression analysis targeting PCOS-susceptible genes. AGN treatment significantly modulated antioxidant defenses in zebrafish, restoring activities of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and reducing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Histologically, AGN mitigated follicular damage and prevented excessive collagen deposition and ovarian hypertrophy, with the gonadosomatic index (GSI) approaching control levels. HPLC analysis confirmed lower BPA accumulation in tissues of AGN-treated groups. Additionally, gene expression studies showed downregulation of PCOS-related genes and TNF-α. AGN exerts a protective role against BPA-induced reproductive toxicity and offers potential as a natural intervention for both ecological and reproductive health challenges."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ischemic stroke is a cerebrovascular disease with highly incidence. Previous research has demonstrated that apigenin provides protective effects against ischemic stroke. However, it remains unclear whether apigenin can regulate intestinal flora against ischemic stroke. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the regulatory effects of apigenin on intestinal microbiota using a middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model. The protective impact of apigenin on brain damage in ischemic stroke rats was assessed through Nissl staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, we employed 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze intestinal contents and utilized non-targeted metabolomics to investigate the effects of apigenin on brain metabolites, thereby exploring its mechanism of action. AMPK levels were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The kit was used to detect oxidative stress and inflammation. RESULTS: The intervention with apigenin resulted in significant alterations in the intestinal flora, characterized by an increase in the abundance of probiotic species and a decrease in harmful flora, alongside notable changes in brain metabolite profiles. This protective effect is attributed to apigenin's promotion of AMPK expression and enhancement of energy metabolism in the context of ischemic stroke. In addition, apigenin improved oxidative stress and inflammation in ischemic stroke. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that apigenin exerts a protective effect on ischemic stroke through the AMPK signaling pathway by modulating intestinal flora and associated metabolites. Consequently, apigenin emerges as a therapeutic candidate warranting further investigation."

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is characterized by memory loss and difficulty in focusing, remembering, adhering to directions, and solving problems; commonly seen in an elderly population. Apigenin (APG) (4', 5, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid with several positive health benefits, including chemoprevention, antioxidant and can suppress inflammatory responses by inhibiting TNF-α and IL-1β levels. In this experimental study, we observed the possible neuroprotective effects of APG in the zebrafish model exposed to Lansoprazole (LPZ), a proton pump inhibitor known to induce cognitive impairment through hyperactivation of GSK-3β pathway. This experiment involves 12 adult zebrafish per group, where one group received LPZ (100 mg) as a toxin for 7 days and APG (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) as treatment, while DPZ (5 mg/kg) served as a standard comparison over the same period. Neurobehavioral tests such as T-Maze, Novel Tank Test (NTT), and Novel Object Recognition (NOR) were performed. Several biochemical assessments were also performed to evaluate the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH), nitrite (NO), acetylcholinesterase activity (AChEs), catalase activity, neurotransmitters (GABA and glutamate), neuroinflammatory markers (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10), and histopathological analysis. The results showed that apigenin enhanced memory function, improved neurotransmitter balance, decreased oxidative stress markers, regulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibited GSK-3β activity. Additionally, the co-administration of a GSK-3β inhibitor further promoted neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement facilitated by apigenin, highlighting the importance of the GSK-3β signaling pathway. These findings highlight the potential of apigenin as a natural compound for mitigating cognitive dysfunction. However, this study should also include long-term toxicity assessments and deeper molecular analysis to elucidate Apigenin's mechanism of action fully. Future research should address these gaps to validate its therapeutic potential.",

This experiment aimed to maximize the apigenin content in parsley extracts using pulsed electric field (PEF) and intense pulsed light (IPL) pretreatment prior to SWE (200 °C for 10 min). The highest apigenin content was 21.17 ± 1.11 mg/g at 2.3 kV/cm, 10-Hz, 3 s by PEF pretreatment, and 14.89 ± 0.41 mg/g at 1,200 V, 60 s by IPL pretreatment. Environmental scanning electron microscopy observations and the electrical disintegration index confirmed that physical damage occurred in the parsley leaves after pretreatment. Physical destruction weakens the structure of parsley leaves and increases the apigenin extraction efficiency. This study found that the combined treatment of SWE with PEF and IPL pretreatments at high temperatures could maximize the extraction efficiency of apigenin from parsley. It can be used in the future to extract high-value-added functional materials in the food industry.

Here we show that macrophage polarizes towards M1 phenotype and TLR7 signaling is activated in septic mice. Moreover, TLR7 deficiency promotes macrophage polarized towards M2 phenotype and attenuates ALI. Strikingly, the natural product of flavone apigenin (Xu et al., 2017 [1]) significantly improves sepsis-induced lung inflammation and lung injury via inhibiting inflammatory macrophages in a TLR7-dependent manner. Mechanically, Api blocked the binding of TLR7 with its agonist miR-146a.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Apigenin, a widely distributed bioactive flavonoid, has recently gained excellent attention among researchers as an effective anticancer drug that can alternate cancer-signaling pathways, induce programmed cell death, and reduce tumor growth in various cancer types. Despite its impressive anti-neoplastic activity, high hydrophobicity, and nonspecific biodistribution make apigenin difficult for pharmaceutical applications. AREAS COVERED: We highlighted the therapeutic potential of apigenin and its derivatives in different cancer types, along with their mechanism of action. Nanoengineered drug delivery systems have remarkable applications in minimizing drug degradation and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs with sustained release, prolonged blood retention time, and reduced off-target toxicities. This review has evaluated and explored the molecular interactions of this novel flavonoid in various cancer signaling pathways to selectively inhibit neoplastic development in multiple cancer types. To ensure the complete coverage of the explored research area, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science were used to find not only the most relevant but also connected and similar articles. EXPERT OPINION: A comprehensive overview of apigenin nanotherapy in cancer treatment can establish a platform to overcome its difficulties for pharmaceutical applications and efficient clinical translation from bench to bedside.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of API on UC via the regulation of PAMP-MRGPRX2-mediated mast cells (MCs) degranulation. BACKGROUND: The pro-inflammatory positive feedback loop mediated by Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2) and its endogenous ligand, PAMP-12, is associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) progression. However, the therapeutic strategies that target MRGPRX2 in the treatment of UC are less reported. Apigenin (API), a natural flavonoid, can relieve inflammation. METHOD: A dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse UC model was used to elucidate the therapeutic effects of API. Animal behavior assessment, serological assays, and histological analysis were performed in wild-type (WT) and MC MrgprB2-conditional knockout (CKO) mouse model. mRNA sequencing analysis, PCR, ELISA, and western blotting were performed in vitro and in vivo to elucidate the mechanism underlying the effect of API by a PAMP-12 triggered MC degranulation model. RESULTS: MC degranulation via MrgprB2 was critical for the persistence of inflammation in colitis. API attenuated colonic tissue damage, splenomegaly, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the colonic tissues. It also ameliorated colonic crypt structure damage and inflammatory cell infiltration. Moreover, API suppressed MCs degranulation, and the level of carboxypeptidases A3 (CPA3), in DSS-induced colitis, thereby blocking the pro-inflammatory positive feedback loop induced by PAMP-MrgprB2. Lastly, API effectively inhibited PAMP-12-triggered mast cell degranulation by regulating Akt1/XBP-1S/CHOP/TXNIP and NF-κB/IL-1β signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: API alleviates inflammatory symptoms in UC by suppressing PAMP-MRGPRX2/B2 mediated MC sustained degranulation feedback loop.",

This study aimed to identify the potential targets and mechanisms of Apigenin in KOA. METHODS: Network pharmacology analysis identified 80 targets of Apigenin, of which 48 overlapped with KOA-related targets. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis and molecular docking were utilized to explore key target genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from human cartilage tissue and in vitro studies using SW1353 cells treated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were analyzed to validate findings. RESULTS: SMR analysis identified EIF6 as a potential target of Apigenin in KOA, negatively associated with disease progression. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinity between Apigenin and EIF6. Single-cell analysis suggested downregulation of EIF6 may contribute to chondrocyte senescence. In vitro, Apigenin (20 μM) reversed H2O2-induced senescence and increased EIF6 expression in SW1353 cells, improving cell viability. CONCLUSION: Apigenin upregulates EIF6 expression and mitigates H2O2-induced chondrocyte senescence, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for KOA. These findings provide insights into the nutritional health benefits of Apigenin and its implications for KOA treatment.",

      "abstract": "Approximately 77.4% of uterine leiomyomas carry MED12 gene mutations (mut-MED12), which are specifically associated with strikingly upregulated expression and activity of the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) enzyme, leading to increased conversion of tryptophan to kynureine. Kynurenine increases leiomyoma cell survival by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We used a leiomyoma-relevant model, in which a MED12 Gly44 mutation was knocked in by CRISPR in a human uterine myometrial smooth muscle (UtSM) cell line, in addition to primary leiomyoma cells from 26 patients to ascertain the mechanisms responsible for therapeutic effects of apigenin, a natural compound. Apigenin treatment significantly decreased cell viability, inhibited cell cycle progression, and induced apoptosis preferentially in mut-MED12 versus wild-type primary leiomyoma and UtSM cells. Apigenin not only blocked AHR action but also decreased TDO2 expression and kynurenine production, preferentially in mut-MED12 cells. Apigenin did not alter TDO2 enzyme activity. TNF and IL-1β, cytokines upregulated in leiomyoma, strikingly induced TDO2 expression levels via activating the NF-κB and JNK pathways, which were abolished by apigenin. Apigenin or a TDO2 inhibitor decreased UtSM cell viability induced by TNF/IL-1β. We provide proof-of-principle evidence that apigenin is a potential therapeutic agent for mut-MED12 leiomyomas.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled inflammation is a key factor in the development of many diseases, and targeting pivotal kinases involved in the inflammatory response, such as interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), holds promise for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Apigenin (Api) is a popular element in numerous plants, possessing anti-inflammatory properties. Many studies have shown that Api modulates NF-κB signaling and MAPK cascade to reduce inflammation, but the exact mechanisms by which Api regulates these pathways remain unclear. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Api on acute inflammation and its specific mechanism in mediating inflammation. METHODS: The dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced ulcerative colitis (UC) model and LPS induced acute inflammation mouse model were established to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Api. Subsequently, the anti-inflammatory activity of Api was validated in vitro and vivo by RNA-seq, qPCR, Western blot, cytokine ELISA, immunofluorescence and histological analysis. A series of experiments were performed to study the effects of Api on IRAK4, including ADP-Glo™ kinase assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and molecular docking simulation. The targeting of Api to IRAK4 was verified by IRAK4 inhibitor and siRNA. RESULTS: Oral administration of Api significantly ameliorated inflammatory conditions in the LPS induced acute inflammation and DSS induced UC mouse models. Furthermore, Api inhibited the expression of interleukin and chemotactic factor genes and downregulated the immune response of macrophages at the transcriptome level. Mechanistically, Api acted as a novel IRAK4 inhibitor, inhibiting kinase activity by direct binding to IRAK4 (Kd = 4.78 μM) with an IC50 of 1.74 μM, interfering with extracellular signaling to the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in an IRAK4 dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In this study, Api was identified for the first time as a natural IRAK4 inhibitor that suppresses cytokine signaling pathways and modulates the immune response at the level of the transcriptome. The results provided valuable insights into the specific mechanism of Api inhibition of inflammatory activation and shed light on opportunities for the development of novel IRAK4 inhibitors based on Api, which is found in various plants.",

      "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare and highly aggressive cancer of the biliary tract, associated with poor clinical outcomes due to late diagnosis, extensive metastasis, drug resistance, and limited treatment options. Apigenin, a natural flavonoid, has been found to exhibit anticancer properties in several types of human cancer cells. Therefore, apigenin may be relevant to developing chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment. In this study, we examined the effects of apigenin on cell viability, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and cell migration in human CCA cell lines (KKU-M055) under in vitro conditions. The results demonstrate that apigenin significantly suppressed specific CCA cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and promoting cell apoptosis in KKU-M055 cells while exhibiting low toxicity in immortalized MMNK1 cells. Apigenin enhanced apoptotic features, including nuclear fragmentation and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, apigenin induced the apoptosis of KKU-M055 cells in both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways by activating caspase-8, -9, and -3/7. Moreover, apigenin inhibited KKU-M055 migration. Our study suggests apigenin as a promising candidate for treating CCA, and these findings provide theoretical support for the further development and potential application of apigenin in clinical CCA therapy."

Obesity-associated IR greatly attributes to low-grade inflammation and high circulating levels of FFAs and sugar. 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to a mixture of TNF-α, fructose, and palmitate acid for 24 h were validated as a model to simulate the pathogenesis of IR in obese people under a high-fat-fructose diet. Results show that the combined induction medium (CIM) successfully induced IR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by impairing insulin signaling pathway. In the meantime, MAPK (JNK, ERK) pathway and NFκB p65 were activated, which are signs of inflammation response. Moreover, CIM caused mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. In addition, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) was evoked by CIM through activating IRE1α/XBP1s, eIF2α, and ATF6. Apigenin could efficiently relieve IR in adipocytes through sensitizing insulin signaling pathway, exerting antioxidant activity, blocking the NFκB pathway, and suppressing ER stress. The present study may provide new tools in discovering preventive and intervention strategies for IR caused by low-grade inflammation and high-fat-fructose diets and provide a basis for the application of apigenin in IR and other IR-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The outcomes of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain far less than favorable. While apigenin is an anti-cancer agent, studies on the mechanism by which it regulates ALL cell cycle progression are inadequate. Ferroptosis and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling are important processes for ALL patients. However, it remains unclear whether apigenin works by affecting AMPK and apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SUP-B15 and T-cell Jurkat ALL cells were treated with apigenin, and cell viability and apoptosis were measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays, respectively. The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay was used to evaluate lipid peroxidation. Intracellular Fe2+ levels were measured using a commercial kit. Corresponding proteins were detected by western blotting. RESULTS: Results showed that apigenin reduced cell viability and the levels of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in a concentration-dependent manner in both types of ALL cells. Apigenin also exerted anti-apoptotic effects on SUP-B15 and Jurkat cells. Apigenin activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and induced ferroptosis, and those effects were attenuated by inhibition of AMPK. Eventually, the reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis caused by apigenin in ALL cells were partly abolished by AMPK inhibition. CONCLUSION: In summary, apigenin exerted anti-leukemia activity in ALL cells, and that effect was partially achieved by activation of AMPK signaling. Our findings suggest apigenin as a potential drug for treatment of ALL.",

      "abstract": "Apigenin, a dietary flavonoid with notable anti-cancer properties, has emerged as a promising candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). While extensively studied for its ability to modulate key molecular pathways in cancers, apigenin also exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing neuroinflammation, protecting neurons from oxidative stress, and enhancing neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. This dual functionality makes apigenin an intriguing therapeutic option for diseases like AD, where kinase dysregulation plays a central role. In this study, we focus on Microtubule Affinity-Regulating Kinase 4 (MARK4), a key enzyme implicated in tauopathies associated with AD, as well as in cancer progression. Through in silico analysis, we explore the interaction between apigenin and MARK4, revealing significant structural changes within the kinase domain upon ligand binding. These computational findings were confirmed via experimental assays using purified recombinant MARK4, where apigenin demonstrated potent inhibition with an IC50 value of 2.39 µM. Fluorescence binding assays further confirmed a strong binding affinity (Ka = 108 M-1), indicating that apigenin efficiently occupies the MARK4 active site, thereby suppressing its enzymatic activity. These results position apigenin as a potent inhibitor of MARK4, offering a dual therapeutic advantage-both as an anti-cancer agent and as a neuroprotective compound for the potential treatment of AD. This study opens new avenues for the development of apigenin-based therapeutics targeting kinase dysregulation in cancer and neurodegeneration."

      "abstract": "Aging is a complicated process, featuring the progressive deterioration of physiological functions and a heightened susceptibility to diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Apigenin, a flavonoid existing in various plants, has attracted attention due to its potential role in anti-aging. In this investigation, the potential effect of apigenin on extending lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Drosophila melanogaster (flies) was explored. The results indicate that apigenin significantly extends both replicative and chronological life duration in yeast, as well as longevity in male and female flies. Apigenin treatment also improves resistance to oxidative stress in both organisms, as manifested by enhanced survival, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, apigenin activates crucial elements of the proteostasis network (PN), such as upregulation of proteostasis-related enzymes activity and genes expression. Network analysis revealed that apigenin affects aging conserved in the longevity-regulating pathway. Notably, Pten is a hub target in flies. Apigenin regulated DmPten at both mRNA and protein expression level while modulating downstream targets, including the phosphorylation of AKT and associated signalling pathways. In a high-sucrose diet (HSD) model, Apigenin treatment extended lifespan, reduced hemolymph glucose levels, enhanced Pten expression, suppressed AKT phosphorylation, and modulated the phosphorylation status of S6K and expression of DmFoxo. These results demonstrate that apigenin could serve as a longevity research object and potential therapeutic drug for promoting health and longevity through its antioxidant and proteostatic properties.",

In recent years, API has attracted considerable attention as a dietary supplement due to its low toxicity, non-mutagenic properties and remarkable therapeutic efficacy in various diseases. In particular, evidence from a large number of preclinical studies suggests that API has promising effects in the prevention and treatment of a variety of liver diseases, including multifactorial liver injury, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the progress of research into the therapeutic applications of API in liver diseases as of August 2024, based on literature retrieved from databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. The hepatoprotective effects of API involve multiple molecular mechanisms, including inhibition of inflammation, alleviation of hepatic oxidative stress, amelioration of insulin resistance, promotion of fatty acid oxidation, inhibition of liver cancer cell proliferation and differentiation, and induction of tumour cell apoptosis. More importantly, signaling pathways such as Nrf2, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, NLRP3, Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β1/Smad3, AMPK/SREBP, PPARα/γ, MAPKs, and Caspases are identified as key targets through which API exerts its beneficial effects in various liver diseases. Studies on its toxicity and pharmacokinetics indicate that API has low toxicity, is slowly metabolized and excreted in vivo, and has low oral bioavailability. In addition, the paper summarises and discusses the sources, physicochemical properties, new dosage forms, and current challenges and opportunities of API, with the aim of providing direction and rationale for the further development and clinical application of API in the food, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields."

      "abstract": "Ocular inflammation is a complex pathology with limited treatment options. While traditional therapies have side effects, novel approaches, such as natural compounds like Apigenin (APG) and Melatonin (MEL) offer promising solutions. APG and MEL, in combination with nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), may provide a synergistic effect in treating ocular inflammation, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing adverse effects. NLC could provide chemical protection of these compounds, while offering a sustained release into the ocular surface. Optimized NLC exhibited suitable physicochemical parameters, physical stability, sustained release of APG and MEL, and were biocompatible in vitro with a corneal cell line, and in ovo by using hen's egg chorioallantoic membrane test. In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the NLC' ability to attenuate inflammation by reducing interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) cytokine levels and by decreasing inflammation in a rabbit model. These findings suggest that the co-encapsulation of APG and MEL into NLC could represent a promising strategy for managing ocular inflammatory conditions.",

The current clinical management of OP predominantly depends on anti-resorptive and anabolic agents. Nevertheless, prolonged use of some of these medications has been observed to reduce efficacy and elevate adverse effects. Given the necessity for sustained or even lifelong treatment of OP, the identification of drugs that are not only effective but also safe and cost-efficient is of utmost significance. As disease treatment paradigms continue to evolve and recent advancements in OP research come to light, certain plant-derived compounds have emerged, presenting notable benefits in the management of OP. This review primarily explores the pharmacological properties of apigenin and elucidates its therapeutic mechanisms in the context of OP. The insights provided herein aspire to offer a foundation for the judicious use of apigenin in forthcoming research, particularly within the scope of OP."

Apigenin, a natural flavonoid, has been shown to have neuroprotective impacts due to its antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of apigenin in prenatal Valproic acid-induced autism in rats. Female rats (220-240 g, 2-3 months) received a single dose of VPA (600 mg/kg, i.p.) on the 12.5th day of gestational. The male offspring were given oral apigenin (50 mg/kg, p.o.) or the vehicle for 30 days. Behavioral tests, biochemical assessments for oxidative stress markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines were performed. VPA-treated rats exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, and repetitive behavior. Social interaction was reduced, and detection of the novel object was impaired. Also, VPA-treated rats have shown higher levels of oxidative stress malondialdehyde (MDA) and lower GPX and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Furthermore, IL-6 and TNF-α increased in the prefrotalcortex decreased. On the other hand, apigenin-treated rats restored the cognitive consequences and lowered oxidative stress and inflammation in the prefrotalcortex. CONCLUSION: Chronic apigenin treatment restored the behavioral and biochemical abnormalities caused by prenatal VPA exposure."

Thus, multi-target drugs that bind multiple sites simultaneously need to be urgently studied. Apigenin has antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we comprehensively explored the potential effect and mechanism of apigenin in SARS-CoV-2 treatment by a network algorithm, deep learning, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and normal mode analysis (NMA). KATZ-based VDA prediction method (VDA-KATZ) indicated that apigenin may provide a latent drug therapy for SARS-CoV-2. Prediction of DTA using convolution model with self-attention (CSatDTA) showed potential binding affinity of apigenin with multiple targets of virus entry, assembly, and cytokine storms including cathepsin L (CTSL), membrane (M), envelope (E), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-1 (Caspase-1). Molecular docking indicated that apigenin could effectively bind these targets, and its stability was confirmed using MD simulation and NMA. Overall, apigenin is a multi-target inhibitor for the entry, assembly, and cytokine storms of SARS-CoV-2.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer worldwide. While chemotherapy remains the standard treatment approach, natural products have emerged as a promising alternative. Among these, apigenin, a natural flavonoid, has garnered significant attention due to its pro-oxidant and antioxidant properties in various types of cancer. This study aimed to assess the potential impact of apigenin in CRC treatment by targeting mitochondrial SIRT3, HMGB1, and beclin 1-mediated autophagy in a mouse model of CRC. We administered 20 mg/kg of dimethyl hydrazine (DMH) intraperitoneally once weekly for 20 weeks to induce CRC in C57BL/6 mice. After 6 weeks of initiating the study, apigenin was intragastrically co-administered by oral gavage at 25 and 50 mg/kg until the end of week 20. The results revealed significant weight loss, shortening of the colon, and diarrhea in DMH-induced CRC, which are considered the marks of CRC. In addition, histopathological examination revealed dysplastic changes in the DMH-treated group, while no dysplasia was found in the apigenin-treated CRC groups. Importantly, the administration of apigenin to DMH-treated animals has led to a significant reduction of SIRT3 and MnSOD expression levels with a significant increase in LC3-II at either dose and a significant dose-dependent increase in the levels of MDA, c-JNK, HMGB1, and beclin 1 compared to the DMH-treated group. In conclusion, apigenin may have a promising role in suppressing DMH-induced CRC. It elicits a pro-oxidant activity by suppressing the gene expression of SIRT3 and subsequently, its target MnSOD, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. The released ROS, in turn, activates JNK-mediated autophagy by enhancing HMGB1, beclin 1, and LC3-II protein levels.",

Despite decades of progress in the study of the pathogenesis of AD, clinical treatment strategies for AD remain lacking. Apigenin, a natural flavonoid compound, is present in a variety of food and Chinese herbs and has been proposed to have a wide range of therapeutic effects on dementia. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relevant pharmacological mechanism and therapeutic effect of apigenin on animal models of AD. METHODS: Computer-based searches of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases were used to identify preclinical literature on the use of apigenin for treating AD. All databases were searched from their respective inception dates until June 2023. The meta-analysis was performed with Review manager 5.4.1 and STATA 17.0. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eventually enrolled, which included 736 animals in total. Meta-analysis showed that apigenin had a positive effect on AD. Compared to controls, apigenin treatment reduced escape latency, increased the percentage of time spent in the target quadrant and the number of plateaus traversed; apigenin was effective in reducing nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) p65 levels; apigenin effectively increased antioxidant molecules SOD and GSH-px and decreased oxidative index MDA; for ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway, apigenin effectively increased BDNF and pCREB molecules; additionally, apigenin effectively decreased caspase3 levels and the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: The results show some efficacy of apigenin in the treatment of AD models. However, further clinical studies are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of apigenin."

Microglial cell activation might contribute to these deficits. The present study evaluated the effects of developmental sub-chronic low-level lead exposure on microglial cells and the possible effectiveness of a natural anti-inflammatory intervention with apigenin to mitigate these effects. From PND 0 to 28, 87 C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to one of six treatment conditions: 0 ppm Pb; 30 ppm Pb; 430 ppm Pb; 30 ppm Pb + 400 ppm apigenin; 430 ppm Pb + 400 ppm apigenin; or 400 ppm apigenin, via dams' drinking water. Following sacrifice, brain tissue was harvested and microglial cells were labeled via immunohistochemistry and counted within the dentate gyrus (DG) using unbiased stereology methods. It was hypothesized that developmental sub-chronic low-level lead exposure would increase microglial cell numbers within the DG and that apigenin treatment may mitigate these effects. A significant effect of treatment group was found and post-hoc analyses revealed that Pb-exposure generated an increased number of microglial cells as compared to controls. Interestingly, the 30 ppm Pb with apigenin treatment group did not generate microglial cell numbers different from the control group unexposed to Pb. These results suggested that developmental sub-chronic low-level lead exposure increased microglial cell activation within the DG and that, at low-levels of Pb exposure, apigenin treatment may mitigate these effects. These results provided the groundwork for studies that could identify an effective intervention to alleviate the effects of developmental chronic low-level lead exposure in child neurocognition.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents a critical complication of Diabetes mellitus (DM), characterized by structural and functional changes in the myocardium independent of coronary artery disease or hypertension. Emerging evidence highlights the significant roles of phytochemicals, particularly astilbin and apigenin, in modulating key molecular pathways implicated in DCM. This review synthesizes current mechanistic insights and therapeutic potential of these compounds, focusing on their interactions with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), protein kinase C (PKC), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Astilbin and apigenin have demonstrated the ability to improve cardiac function, mitigate oxidative stress, and reduce inflammatory responses in diabetic conditions. By activating AMPK and PPARs, these flavonoids enhance glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, contributing to improved metabolic homeostasis. Their inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation, SGLT2 activity, and PKC signaling further attenuates hyperglycemia-induced cellular damage. Additionally, suppression of NF-κB, MAPK, and JNK pathways by astilbin and apigenin results in reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and apoptotic cell death. Collectively, these interactions position astilbin and apigenin as promising therapeutic agents for ameliorating DCM, offering novel avenues for treatment strategies aimed at modulating multiple pathogenic pathways."

      "abstract": "Due to the high incidence of diabetes and its associated complications, diabetes is widely recognized as a serious global health problem. In diabetes treatment strategies, targeting α-glucosidase, a key carbohydratehydrolyzing enzyme, has emerged as a highly regarded approach. To develop novel α-glucosidase inhibitors, we successfully synthesized a series of apigenin analogs, collectively referred to as H1-H27 compounds and examined their inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase activity. H7 showed a remarkable inhibitory effect, surpassing that of the standard drug acarbose. Further analysis revealed that H7, H10, and H24 act as non-competitive inhibitors of α- glucosidase. In vivo experiments using a type 2 diabetes mouse model demonstrated the diverse therapeutic potential of H7; it effectively lowered blood sugar levels, improved glucose tolerance, and corrected lipid metabolism. In addition, H7 showed hepatoprotective effects, highlighting its ability to improve liver function. H7 also positively influenced the gut microbiota composition in diabetic mice, increasing diversity and richness. These results highlight the promising therapeutic effects of apigenin analogs, such as H7, for treating type 2 diabetes and show how they could provide numerous benefits, including effective inhibition of α-glucosidase, improved glucose control, correction of lipid metabolism, hepatoprotection, and modulation of the intestinal microbiota.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. Apigenin (APG), known for its antioxidant properties, holds potential as a therapeutic compound in ALS. METHODS: We used the Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J transgenic mouse model of ALS to investigate the therapeutic effects of APG. Key measured included motor function via the ALSTDI score, molecular markers of oxidative stress (OS) and apoptosis in spinal cord tissues. Techniques used included pathological, Western blotting, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR to assess the effect of ALDH1A2. RESULTS: APG treatment attenuated weight loss and improved motor function scores in ALS mice compared to untreated ALS models. Molecular analyses revealed a significant upregulation of ALDH1A2 in APG-treated groups, along with a reduction in markers of OS and apoptosis. In vitro studies in NSC34 cells further confirmed the protective effects of APG against SOD1*G93A mutation-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, suppression of ALDH1A2 by shRNA exacerbated disease markers that were ameliorated by APG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that APG attenuates the progression of ALS pathology by regulating OS and apoptosis through ALDH1A2. These results support further investigation of APG as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of ALS.",

Apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a natural flavonoid that exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. The present study aims to investigate the effect of apigenin on perimenopausal syndrome by combining bioinformatics analysis with in vivo experiments. The mouse model with perimenopausal syndrome was established using 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) treatment. Apigenin alleviated VCD-induced disorder of estrous cycle and shrinkage of ovarian tissue. The reduction of anti-Muller hormone and the increase of follicle stimulation hormone and luteinizing hormone triggered by VCD were reversed by apigenin in a dose-dependent manner. Apigenin suppressed the VCD-induced decrease of primordial, primary, secondary and antral follicle number in ovarian tissue. Oxidative stress in ovarian tissue was activated by VCD treatment through increasing the reactive oxygen species production. High concentration of apigenin significantly reversed the alteration induced by VCD. Apigenin alleviated VCD-induced cell apoptosis through regulating Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved PARP1 and caspase-3. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO3a was inhibited by VCD and activated by apigenin in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, apigenin effectively mitigates the ovarian dysfunction through suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis via the AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway.",

Advanced bioinformatics techniques were employed to evaluate and contrast binding energies, showing that apigenin and luteolin demonstrate significantly higher affinities for TP-53, pRb, and APOBEC, with binding energies of -6.9 kcal/mol and -6.6 kcal/mol, respectively. These values suggest strong potential for therapeutic intervention against HPV-16. Conventional ligands, by comparison, exhibited lower affinities, with energies ranging from -4.5 to -5.5 kcal/mol. Additionally, protein-protein docking simulations were performed to assess the interaction between HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein and tumor suppressors TP-53 and pRb, which revealed high binding energies around -976.7 kcal/mol, indicative of their complex interaction. A conversion formula was applied to translate these protein-protein interaction energies to a comparable scale for non-protein interactions, further underscoring the superior binding potential of apigenin and luteolin. These findings highlight the therapeutic promise of these natural compounds in preventing HPV-16-induced oncogenesis, warranting further experimental validation for clinical applications."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The lung is a moderately radio-sensitive organ. When cells are damaged due to accidental radiation exposure or treatment, they release molecules that lead to the recruitment of immune cells, accumulating inflammatory cytokines at the site of damage. Apigenin (Api) is a natural flavonoid known for its anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the radioprotective properties of Api in the lung. METHODS: Thirty-six Wistar rats were randomly assigned to nine groups: control, radiation (Rad), CMC+Rad, Api10+Rad, and Api20+Rad. Api was administered with an intraperitoneal injection for 7 days, after which the rats were irradiated with 6 Gy whole-body X-ray. At 6 and 72 hours post-irradiation, the rats were euthanized, and their lung tissue was extracted. RESULTS: Radiation led to increased alveolar wall thickness and the infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes. Furthermore, the expression levels of inflammatory factors such as a nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NF-ĸB), Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), and epigenetic factors including DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) and Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) were elevated in the lung tissue following radiation. Meanwhile, the expression level of IκB-α decreased. However, administration of Api (at both 10&20 mg/kg) reversed the adverse effects of radiation. CONCLUSION: Api administration mitigated radiation-induced lung damage by reversing inflammatory and epigenetic changes."

Apigenin is a natural herbal product that has demonstrated anti-cancer effects in numerous studies, both in vitro and in vivo, on various cancers. Our in silico analysis showed that PIM1 expression was significantly higher in GBM tumor tissue compared to normal brain tissue, and high PIM1 expression correlated with worse survival rates in patients with GBM. Also, our molecular docking studies showed that apigenin and its dimeric flavonoids, such as amentoflavone and hinokiflavone, can bind to the ATP-binding site of PIM1 with significant binding affinity and form various intermolecular interactions with key amino acid residues. Notably, dimeric flavonoids have a stronger binding affinity than apigenin, indicating their potential as potent PIM1 inhibitors. Our findings demonstrated the therapeutic potential of apigenin and its dimeric flavonoid forms in treating GBM by targeting PIM1 kinase. The observed inhibitory effects of PIM1 can inhibit tumor growth, induce cell cycle arrest, and promote apoptosis. However, further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to confirm their anticancer potentials and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of these compounds in GBM treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Sjögren's syndrome (SS)-an autoimmune disease characterized by dry mouth and eyes-salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) undergo ferroptosis, which disrupts their integrity and impairs saliva secretion. Apigenin, a phytoestrogen, is known to activate estrogen signalling and alleviate xerostomia in ovariectomized mice; however, its effect on SGEC survival and function in SS remains unclear. We hypothesized that apigenin alleviates SS symptoms and progression by inhibiting ferroptosis in SGECs and aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Apigenin (50 mg/kg) was orally gavaged to non-obese diabetic (NOD)/LtJ female mice (SS model); changes in SS functional indicators were analyzed using mRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of submandibular glands. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-stimulated SGECs were used to model SS in vitro; SGEC activity and aquaporin 5 (AQP5) expression were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining, transmission electron microscopy, RT-qPCR, western blotting and other methods were used to verify the mechanisms. RESULTS: Apigenin significantly increased salivary secretion and AQP5 expression while inhibiting ferroptosis and immune infiltration in NOD mouse submandibular glands. The oxidative stress gene ATF3 was upregulated and GPX4 was downregulated in NOD mice compared to that in control group (ICR mice); however, apigenin reversed this effect. IFN-γ treatment downregulated AQP5, SLC7A11, and GPX4 expression while promoting ATF3 expression and ferroptosis, which was mitigated by apigenin. ATF3 knockdown increased SLC7A11 and GPX4 expression, inhibiting SS and ferroptosis. Furthermore, apigenin inhibited ferroptosis in SGECs through ESR1 binding to ATF3. CONCLUSION: Apigenin alleviates SS by regulating SGEC ferroptosis via the ERα-regulated ATF3/SLC7A11 axis, highlighting its therapeutic potential in SS.",

Campsis grandiflora (Thunb.) K. Schum (Lingxiaohua) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and the exact active constituents and putative mechanisms for treating PD are unknown. Through data mining and network pharmacology, apigenin (APi) was identified as the main active ingredient of Lingxiaohua, and key targets (TNF, AKT1, INS, TP53, CASP3, JUN, BCL2, MMP9, FOS, and HIF1A) of Lingxiaohua for the treatment of PD were discovered. The primary routes implicated were identified as PI3K/AKT, Apoptosis, TNF, and NF-κB pathways. Subsequently, therapeutic potential of APi in PD and its underlying mechanism were experimentally evaluated. APi suppressed the release of mediators of inflammation and initiation of NF-κB pathways in MES23.5 cells induced by MPP+. APi suppressed caspase-3 activity and apoptosis and elevated p-AKT levels in MES23.5 cells. Pretreatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, resulted in APi treatment blocking the activation of NF-κB pathway and expression of inflammatory factors in MES23.5 cells by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. In conclusion, APi protects dopaminergic neurons by controlling the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway, giving novel insights into the pharmacological mechanism of Lingxiaohua in treating PD.",

This study's goal was to identify the impacts of diverse photobiomodulation procedures on the motility of sperm in vitro in patients with asthenospermia, either in isolation or in combination with Apigenin. At 633 nm and 808 nm, the lasers are used with multiple dose values (0.6, 1.2, and 2.4) J/cm2 and altering Apigenin concentrations (5, 10, 25, and 50 μM). All of the photobiomodulation procedures were assessed. Assessing factors were the DNA fragmentation index, sperm viability, as well as progressive sperm motility. The progressive sperm motility results for 633 nm and 808 nm show a significant increase over 633 nm + 808 nm after 60 min after irradiation. Sperm motility increased more quickly under the 808 nm procedure than under the other procedures (p < 0.02). The observation of progressive sperm motility indicated that a 10 μM concentration of Apigenin created higher results than other concentrations (p < 0.01). Apigenin with 808 nm at 1.2 J/cm2 resulted in better sperm motility (p < 0.01) and decreased DNA fragmentation index. There was a notable increase (p < 0.05) in the DNA fragmentation index with the 633 nm + 808 nm procedure. At a 10 μM concentration of Apigenin, the DNA fragmentation index was lower than at a 50 μM concentration (p < 0.02). Neither Apigenin nor photobiomodulation significantly decreased sperm viability. The study suggests that asthenozoospermia patients may benefit from apigenin utilized alongside photobiomodulation, while further investigation is required.",

For this purpose, rats underwent a 28-day SI period followed by a 4-week oral Api treatment (50 mg/kg/day, PO). On Day 56, behaviour tests were performed, including an elevated plus maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM), and three-chamber social tests. The oxidative stress markers, IL-6, and BDNF levels were measured in the hippocampus. Our results showed that SI stress caused an increase in anxiety and a decrease in spatial memory, sociability, and social preference index. In addition, SI stress increased hippocampal levels of IL-6 and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, whereas it reduced the hippocampal BDNF level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Our study indicated that Api attenuates anxiety and causes improvements in spatial memory and social interaction. These desirable effects of Api might be related to amelioration in the BDNF level, IL-6, and oxidative stress biomarkers in the hippocampus.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The development of cancer is accompanied by metabolic reprogramming, and the liver serves as a central hub for lipid transportation. Apigenin, a plant-derived flavonoid, demonstrates potent anticancer properties across various cancer types and exhibits promising potential as a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment. However, there are limited studies focusing on the downstream targets of apigenin. Moreover, there are few reports on the impact of apigenin in lipid metabolism within liver cancer cells. PURPOSE: The objective is to elucidate the metabolic mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of apigenin on liver cancer progression, search for downstream targets and provide reliable data support for the clinical trials of apigenin. METHODS: Anticancer effects of apigenin were detected at cellular and molecular levels in vitro, and downstream targets of apigenin, especially metabolic pathway genes, were analyzed by transcriptome. Next, the downstream target of apigenin was verified and the biological function of the downstream target was examined. Finally, the downstream target of apigenin was further verified by restoring target gene expression. RESULTS: Cellular molecular experiments showed that Apigenin inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and lipid metabolism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Transcriptome analysis showed apigenin widely regulates histone demethylase, particularly histone H3K4 lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A). Apigenin treatment inhibited the expression of KDM1A protein and mRNA levels in liver cancer cells, molecular docking predicted the interaction between apigenin and KDM1A. Furthermore, downregulation KDM1A inhibited the proliferation and lipid metabolism of HCC cells, in the same way, overexpressing KDM1A promoted proliferation of HCC cells. Finally, restoring KDM1A expression partially attenuated the effects of apigenin on lipid metabolism in HCC cells. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence that apigenin inhibits liver cancer progression and elucidates its mechanism of action in regulating lipid metabolism. Specifically, we find that apigenin suppresses the progression of HCC cells by downregulating genes involved in lipid metabolism. Additionally, our results indicate that KDM1A acts as a downstream target of apigenin in the inhibition of lipid metabolism in HCC. These findings offer experimental support for the potential use of apigenin as a therapeutic agent for liver cancer, highlighting its relevance in future clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Cancer remains a global health problem that requires constant research for the development of new treatment strategies. Flavonoids, a diverse group of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds abundant in fruits, vegetables, and other plant sources, have received considerable attention for their potential anticancer properties. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current scientific literature on five specific natural flavonoids, namely quercetin, Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG), kaempferol, apigenin, and curcumin that have been widely reported in numerous carcinomas and evaluate their effectiveness and mechanisms in fighting different types of cancer. Known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, quercetin has shown promise in inhibiting cancer cells and modulating key signaling pathways. EGCG, a prominent catechin found in green tea, has been extensively studied for its ability to induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as an anticancer agent. Kaempferol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and has shown anticancer potential by modulating cellular processes involved in tumor development. Apigenin, abundant in parsley and chamomile, has been shown to exert anticancer properties by interrupting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Curcumin has shown several anticancer effects, including inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and modulating inflammatory pathways. Despite these promising findings, it is essential to recognize the complexity of cancer biology and the need for further research to clarify the precise mechanisms of action of these natural flavonoids and optimize their therapeutic applications. Furthermore, understanding flavonoids' potential synergy and interactions with traditional cancer therapies is paramount for developing effective combinatorial strategies. This review thus aimed to summarize the current knowledge on these natural flavonoids and provide insight into their potential role as an adjunctive or stand-alone therapy in the fight against breast, prostate, colon, lung, skin, ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancer."

Dietary flavonoids, as for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, have shown therapeutic potential under various inflammatory conditions. Apigenin (AP) is one of the most studied phenolics and is found in many fruits, vegetables and herbs. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of apigenin on LN. We evaluated the effects of apigenin on MRL/lpr mice, a well-established model for spontaneous LN. Apigenin treatment improved peripheral blood profiles, reduced serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-17, TGF-β), lowered levels of autoantibodies (ANA, anti-dsDNA) and alleviated renal damage caused by autoantibodies and inflammatory cell infiltration. The results of immunohistochemistry and transcriptome analysis showed that AP could inhibit the infiltration of CD8+ cells in renal tissues. Single-cell sequencing public data from LN patients identified cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as the primary CD8+ T cell subtype in the kidneys, with their differentiation regulated by STAT3. In this study, cell experiments demonstrated that AP can induce apoptosis in CD8+ T cells and reduce their recruitment of macrophages by inhibiting the STAT3/IL-17 signaling pathway. These findings highlight that a diet rich in dietary flavonoids, particularly apigenin, can offer therapeutic benefits for patients with SLE.",

Apigenin, a natural flavonoid abundantly found in various plants, has garnered attention for its potential neuroprotective properties. In this study, we employed molecular docking simulations to investigate the interaction between apigenin and key molecular targets associated with neurological disorders. METHODS: The molecular docking analysis focused on receptors implicated in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotransmission regulation. RESULTS: Our results reveal a high binding affinity of apigenin towards critical targets, including GABA, mACh, nACh, NMDA, 5HTA, AMPA, insulin, and dopamine receptors. The findings suggest that apigenin may exert its neuroprotective effects through multifaceted mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neurotransmission regulatory pathways. Additionally, the absence of adverse binding poses emphasizes the safety profile of apigenin. CONCLUSIONS: This molecular docking study provides valuable insights into the potential therapeutic role of apigenin in mitigating molecular pathways implicated in neurological disorders. Further in vitro and in vivo investigations are warranted to validate and elucidate the neuroprotective mechanisms of apigenin, paving the way for its development as a promising treatment option for various neurological conditions.",

      "abstract": "The plasmid-mediated gene mcr-1 that makes bacteria resistant to the antibiotic colistin is spreading quickly, which means that colistin is no longer working well to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections. Herein, we utilized a computer-aided high-throughput screening drugs method to identify the natural product apigenin, a potential mcr-protein inhibitor, which effectively enhanced the antimicrobial activity of colistin. Several assays, including a checkerboard minimum inhibitory concentration assay, a time-kill assay, the combined disk test, molecular simulation dynamics, and animal infection models assay, were conducted to verify whether apigenin enhanced the ability of colistin to fight Gram-negative bacterial infections. The results showed that apigenin improved the antimicrobial activity of colistin against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection. Moreover, apigenin not only did not increase the toxic effect of colistin but also had the ability to effectively inhibit the frequency of bacterial resistance mutations to colistin. Studies clearly elucidated that apigenin could interfere with the thermal stability of the protein by binding to the mcr-1 protein. Additionally, the combination of apigenin and colistin could exert multiple effects, including disrupting bacterial membranes, the generation of bacterial nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, as well as inhibiting bacterial adenosine triphosphate production. Furthermore, the addition of apigenin was able to significantly inhibit colistin-stimulated high expression levels of the bacterial mcr-1 gene. Finally, apigenin exhibited a characteristic anti-inflammatory effect while enhancing the antimicrobial activity of colistin against mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli (E. coli) infected animals. In conclusion, as a potential lead compound, apigenin is promising in combination with colistin in the future treatment of mcr-1-positive E. coli infections.IMPORTANCEThis study found that apigenin was able to inhibit the activity of the mcr-1 protein using a high-throughput virtual screening method. Apigenin effectively enhanced the antimicrobial activity of colistin against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including mcr-1-positive strains, in vitro and in vivo. This study will provide new options and strategies for the future treatment of multidrug-resistant pathogen infections.",

Abnormal vasculogenesis is a common event in polycystic ovary syndrome. This study planned to evaluate the antiangiogenic role of apigenin in ovarian histology, gene expression, and vascular density and stability in an experimental model of PCOS. Twenty-eight rats weighing 180-250 g were divided into 4 groups. Seven rats in the control group remain intact and without treatment. In 21 rats, an ovary polycystic model with a single injection of estradiol valerate was established. The PCOS rats were treated with vehicle, apigenin 10, or apigenin 20 mg/kg in three different PCOS groups for 14 days. At the end, a histological assessment of the ovaries was performed to determine collagen density and follicle counting. The endothelial or periendothelial cells were determined by immunohistochemical assay, and angiogenesis gene expression was determined using molecular assessments. Apigenin treatment partially restored follicular development, decreased the number of cysts, and increased corpora lutea in PCOS rats. Also, apigenin decreased the collagen density in the polycystic ovaries. However, apigenin administration mitigated ovarian angiogenesis by a reduction in endothelial and periendothelial cell numbers. A decrease in VEGF and VEGF R2 (kinase insert domain receptor, KDR) expressions was found after the treatment of rats with apigenin. Conclusively, our data revealed that apigenin improves ovarian histological alterations and follicular dynamics in polycystic ovary rats. The effect is partially mediated by suppression of the VEGF signaling system and reduction in endothelial and periendothelial cell proliferation.",

Apigenin, a natural flavonoid in celery, induces vascular dilation via endothelial transient receptor potential channel vanilla 4 (TRPV4) channels. This study aimed to explore apigenin's potential to alleviate obesity-related hypertension in mice and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The C57BL/6 and TRPV4 knockout mice were fed a high-fat diet and subjected to dietary intervention with apigenin. Body weight and tail blood pressure of the mice were measured during the feeding. Vascular reactivity was assessed through a DMT wire myograph systems in vitro. The distribution and expression of adiponectin and pro-inflammatory markers in brown fat were detected. Injecting adeno-associated eight (AAV8) viruses into brown adipose tissue (BAT) to determine whether adiponectin is indispensable for the therapeutic effect of apigenin. Palmitic acid (PA) was used in mouse brown adipocytes to examine the detailed mechanisms regulating adiponectin secretion. RESULTS: Apigenin improved vasodilation and reduced blood pressure in obese mice, effects partly blocked in TRPV4 knockout. It also reduced weight gain independently of TRPV4. Apigenin increased adiponectin secretion from BAT; knockdown of adiponectin weakened its benefits. Apigenin downregulated Cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38), restoring Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ (NAD+) levels and activating the NAD+/Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) pathway, enhancing adiponectin expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that dietary apigenin is suitable as a nonpharmaceutical intervention for obesity-related hypertension. In mechanism, in addition to improving vascular relaxation through the activation of endothelial TRPV4 channels, apigenin also directly alleviated adipose inflammation and increased adiponectin levels by inhibiting CD38.",

Xanthine oxidase (XOD) and the NOD like receptor-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome are the key targets for acute gout treatment. Chlorogenic acid has been reported with a good anti-inflammatory activity, and Apigenin showed an excellent potential in XOD inhibition. Therefore, a series of chlorogenic acid-apigenin (CA) conjugates with varying linkers were designed and synthesized as dual XOD/NLRP3 inhibitors, and their activities both in XOD and NLRP3 inhibition were evaluated. An in vitro study of XOD inhibitory activity revealed that the majority of CA conjugates exhibited favorable XOD inhibitory activity. Particularly, the effects of compounds 10c and 10d, with an alkyl linker on the apigenin moiety, were stronger than that of allopurinol. The selected CA conjugates also demonstrated a favorable anti-inflammatory activity in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, compound 10d, which showed the optimal activity both in XOD inhibition and anti-inflammatory, was chosen and its inhibitory ability on NLRP3 and related proinflammatory cytokines was further tested. Compound 10d effectively reduced NLRP3 expression and the secretion of interluekin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) with an activity stronger than the positive control isoliquiritigenin (ISL). Based on these findings, compound 10d exhibits dual XOD/NLRP3 inhibitory activity and, therefore, the therapeutic effects on acute gout is worthy of further study.",

      "abstract": "Apigenin, a dietary flavonoid, has gained increasing attention for its potential therapeutic applications in radiation protection and radiosensitization. Ionizing radiation (IR) can harm healthy cells, but as radiotherapy remains crucial in cancer treatment. Owing to the remarkable application of radiotherapy in the treatment of cancers, it is vital to protect healthy cells from radiation hazards while increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation. This article reviews the current understanding of apigenin's radioprotective and radiosensitive properties with a focuses on the involved signaling pathways and key molecular targets. When exposed to irradiation, apigenin reduces inflammation via cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and modulates proapoptotic and antiapoptotic biomarkers. Apigenin's radical scavenging abilities and antioxidant enhancement mitigate oxidative DNA damage. It inhibits radiation-induced mammalian target of rapamycin activation, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP), and STAT3 expression, while promoting AMPK, autophagy, and apoptosis, suggesting potential in cancer prevention. As a radiosensitizer, apigenin inhibits tumor growth by inducing apoptosis, suppressing VEGF-C, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and STAT3, reducing MMP-2/9 activity, and inhibiting cancer cell glucose uptake. Cellular and animal studies support apigenin's radioprotective and anticancer potential, making it a potential candidate for further research. Investigation into apigenin's therapeutic efficacy in diverse cancer types and radiation damage is essential.",

Bioactive that modulate the WAT microenvironment to induce trans browning in white adipocytes have been explored as a strategy to control unregulated lipid storage. However, relying on a single bioactive for modulating lipid metabolism has proven insufficient in obese individuals during human trials, because these compounds primarily activate a single biochemical pathway in promoting browning. Consequently, there is a growing emphasis on targeting multiple pathways to ensure a safe and effective browning process. The present study investigated the combinatorial effect of bioactives namely Apigenin and Resveratrol for activating multiple pathways for effective trans-browning of white adipocytes. The combination was seen to promote the browning more effectively than the single bioactive, as the combination simultaneously activated multiple signaling pathways to induce angiogenesis-mediated browning in primary white adipocytes isolated from obese mice. Activation of PI3K signaling via estrogen receptor-α-dependent pathway resulted in simultaneous activation of angiogenesis and trans browning in white adipocytes. The study provides valuable insights into the potential use of bioactives in combination with therapeutic intervention to improve the overall health of obese subjects by enhancing lipid metabolism by activating trans-differentiation of white adipocytes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chicken coccidiosis is an intracellular parasitic disease that presents major challenges to the development of the commercial poultry industry. Perennial drug selective pressure has led to the multi-drug resistance of chicken coccidia, which makes the prevention and control of chicken coccidiosis extremely difficult. In recent years, natural plant products have attracted the attention of researchers due to their inherent advantages, such as the absence of veterinary drug residues. The development of these natural products provides a new direction for the prevention and treatment of chicken coccidiosis. METHODS: The anticoccidial effect of a natural plant product combination formulation (eucalyptus oil + apigenin + eugenol essential oil) was tested against Eimeria tenella in broilers. To search for the optimal concentration of the combination formulation, we screened 120 broilers in a chicken cage trial in which 100 broilers were infected with 5 × 104 sporulated Eimeria tenella oocysts; broilers receiving a decoquinate solution was set up as a chemical control. The optimal anticoccidial concentration was determined by calculating the anticoccidial index (ACI), and the suitable concentration was used as the recommended dose for a series of safety dose assessment tests, such as feed conversion ratio (FCR), hematological indices and serum biochemical indices, as well as liver and kidney sections, at onefold (low dose), threefold (medium dose) and sixfold (high dose) the recommended dose (RD). RESULTS: The results showed that this combination formulation of three plant natural products had a better anticoccidial effect than formulations containing two plant natural products or a single one, with an ACI of 169.3. The dose gradient anticoccidial test revealed that the high-dose formulation group had a better anticoccidial effect (ACI = 169.2) than the medium- and low-dose groups. The safety evaluation test showed that concentrations of the formulation at one-, three- and sixfold the RD were non-toxic to Arbor Acres broilers, indicating the high safety of the combination formulation. CONCLUSIONS: The combination formulation showed not only a moderate anticoccidial effect but also had a high safety profile for broilers. The results of this study indicate a new alternative for the prevention and control of coccidiosis in broilers.",

On the molecular level, apigenin augmented the immunohistochemical expression of cleaved caspase-3 and attenuated SIRT3 and SHMT2 mRNA expression CRC patients with decreased SHMT2 expression had improved overall and disease-free survival rates. In vitro, apigenin reduced the cell viability in a time-dependent manner, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and increased the apoptotic cell population compared to the untreated control. Mechanistically, apigenin treatment mitigated the expression of SHMT2, SIRT3, and its upstream long intergenic noncoding RNA LINC01234 in CRC cells. Conclusively, apigenin induces caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in CRC through modulation of SIRT3-triggered mitochondrial pathway suggesting it as a promising therapeutic agent to improve patient outcomes.",

Based on the pharmacodynamic substance of S. miltiorrhiza, the aim of present study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of S. miltiorrhiza against cardiac fibrosis (CF) through a systematic network pharmacology approach, molecular docking and dynamics simulation as well as experimental investigation in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic pharmacological analysis was conducted using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacology (TCMSP) database to screen the effective chemical components of S. miltiorrhiza, then the corresponding potential target genes of the compounds were obtained by the Swiss Target Prediction and TCMSP databases. Meanwhile, GeneCards, DisGeNET, OMIM, and TTD disease databases were used to screen CF targets, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of drug-disease targets was constructed on S. miltiorrhiza/CF targets by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STING) database. After that, the component-disease-target network was constructed by software Cytoscape 3.7. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were performed for the intersection targets between drug and disease. The relationship between active ingredient of S. miltiorrhiza and disease targets of CF was assessed via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Subsequently, the underlying mechanism of the hub compound on CF was experimentally investigated in vitro. RESULTS: 206 corresponding targets to effective chemical components from S. miltiorrhiza were determined, and among them, there were 82 targets that overlapped with targets of CF. Further, through PPI analysis, AKT1 and GSK3β were the hub targets, and which were both enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, it was the sub-pathways of the lipid and atherosclerosis pathway. Subsequently, compound-disease-genes-pathways diagram is constructed, apigenin (APi) was a top ingredients and AKT1 (51) and GSK3β (22) were the hub genes according to the degree value. The results of molecular docking and dynamics simulation showed that APi has strong affinities with AKT and GSK3β. The results of cell experiments showed that APi inhibited cells viability, proliferation, proteins expression of α-SMA and collagen I/III, phosphorylation of AKT1 and GSK3β in MCFs induced by TGFβ1. CONCLUSION: Through a systematic network pharmacology approach, molecular docking and dynamics simulation, and confirmed by in vitro cell experiments, these results indicated that APi interacts with AKT and GSK3β to disrupt the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and differentiation of MCFs induced by TGFβ1, which providing new insights into the pharmacological mechanism of S. miltiorrhiza in the treatment of CF.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Apigenin, a natural bioflavonoid, is reported as an anti-diabetic agent since it possesses the ability to inhibit α-glucosidase activity, cause stimulation of insulin action and secretion, manage ROS, and prevent diabetes complications. Apigenin was identified as a new insulin secretagogue that enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and seems like a better antidiabetic drug candidate. Here we explored the insulinotropic mechanism(s) of apigenin in vitro in mice islets and in vivo in diabetic rats. METHODS: Size-matched pancreatic islets were divided into groups and incubated in the presence or absence of apigenin and agonists or antagonists of major insulin signaling pathways. The secreted insulin was measured by ELISA. The intracellular cAMP was estimated by cAMP acetylation assay. The acute and chronic effects of apigenin were evaluated in diabetic rats. RESULTS: apigenin dose-dependently enhanced insulin secretion in isolated mice islets, and its insulinotropic effect was exerted at high glucose concentrations distinctly different from glibenclamide. Furthermore, apigenin amplified glucose-induced insulin secretion in depolarized and glibenclamide-treated islets. Apigenin showed no effect on intracellular cAMP concentration; however, an additive effect was observed by apigenin in both forskolin and IBMX-induced insulin secretion. Interestingly, H89, a PKA inhibitor, and U0126, a MEK kinase inhibitor, significantly inhibited apigenin-induced insulin secretion; however, no significant effect was observed by using ESI-05, an epac2 inhibitor. Apigenin improved glucose tolerance and increased glucose-stimulated plasma insulin levels in diabetic rats. Apigenin also lowered blood glucose in diabetic rats upon chronic treatment. CONCLUSION: Apigenin exerts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by modulating the PKA-MEK kinase signaling cascade independent of K-ATP channels.",

      "abstract": "Apigenin, a naturally derived flavonoid, is increasingly being acknowledged for its potential therapeutic applications, especially in oncology. This research explores apigenin's capacity to modulate cancer cell viability, emphasizing its roles beyond its minimal antioxidant activity attributed to its basic molecular structure devoid of hydroxyl groups. We investigated apigenin's effects on two breast cancer cell lines, estrogen-dependent MCF-7 and non-estrogen-dependent MDA-MB-231 cells. Our findings reveal that apigenin exerts a dose-dependent cytotoxic and anti-migratory impact on these cells. Interestingly, both apigenin and doxorubicin-a standard chemotherapeutic agent-induced lipid droplet accumulation in a dose-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells. This phenomenon was absent in MCF-7 cells and not evident when doxorubicin and apigenin were used concurrently, suggesting distinct cellular responses to these treatments that imply that their synergistic effects might be mediated through mechanisms unrelated to lipid metabolism. A further chemoinformatics analysis indicated that apigenin and doxorubicin might interact primarily at the level of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, with potential indirect influences from the AKT and MYC signaling pathways. These results highlight the importance of understanding the nuanced interactions between apigenin and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, as they could lead to more effective strategies for cancer treatment. This study underscores apigenin's potential as a modulator of cancer cell dynamics through mechanisms independent of its direct antioxidant effects, thereby contributing to the development of flavonoid-based adjunct therapies in cancer management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Apigenin is a natural flavonoid compound with proven antitumor activity. However, its precise underlying pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. Oxaliplatin (OXA) is commonly utilized for cancer treatment as a platinum-based chemotherapy drug. However, the utilization of low-dose OXA carries the risk of inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells and promoting tumor metastasis, thereby giving rise to potential side effects. The purpose of this study is to investigate the synergistic inhibitory effect of apigenin and OXA and its potential mechanism. METHODS: HSC-3 cells of oral squamous carcinoma cells (OSCCs) were divided into control, apigenin-treated and co-treated groups. A wound healing assay was conducted to assess alterations in cellular motility and migration, an invasion assay was performed to assess invasiveness, and a three-dimensional culture assay was employed to evaluate angiogenic capacity. Cultured cells were utilized for total DNA extraction, followed by reverse transcription. Relative RNA levels were obtained, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was conducted to assess the efficiency of LINC00857 expression. RESULTS: The administration of a low dose of OXA promoted the migratory, invasive, and angiogenic capabilities of HSC-3 cells, while also regulating EMT-associated molecular markers to facilitate the process of EMT. The inhibitory impact on OSCC proliferation was enhanced by the synergistic effect of apigenin and OXA. Furthermore, the tumor-promoting effects induced by low-dose OXA were notably suppressed through LINC00857. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this study indicates that apigenin can effectively suppress the metastasis of OSCC cancer cells induced by low-dose OXA through inhibiting the level of LINC00857, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy."

Yet excessive accumulation of urate, known as hyperuricemia, is the primary risk factor for the development of gout. The high-capacity urate transporter GLUT9 represents a promising target for gout treatment. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human GLUT9 in complex with urate or its inhibitor apigenin at overall resolutions of 3.5 Å and 3.3 Å, respectively. In both structures, GLUT9 exhibits an inward open conformation, wherein the substrate binding pocket faces the intracellular side. These structures unveil the molecular basis for GLUT9's substrate preference of urate over glucose, and show that apigenin acts as a competitive inhibitor by occupying the substrate binding site. Our findings provide critical information for the development of specific inhibitors targeting GLUT9 as potential therapeutics for gout and hyperuricemia.",

However, its effects and mechanisms on the pyroptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by doxorubicin (DOX) are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of GSK-3β and the effects of apigenin in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. H9c2 cells stimulated with DOX were treated with SB216763 and apigenin. Additionally, a mouse model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity was prepared and further treated with apigenin and SB216763 for 30 days. The findings revealed that treatment with SB216763 or apigenin resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of pyroptosis-related factors. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of GSK-3β was enhanced while the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-κB) p65 was reduced following treatment with either SB216763 or apigenin. Conversely, the effects of apigenin treatment were nullified in siRNA-GSK-3β-transfected cells. Results from computer simulation and molecular docking analysis supported that apigenin could directly target the regulation of GSK-3β. Therefore, our study confirmed that the inhibition of GSK-3β and treatment with apigenin effectively suppressed the pyroptosis of cardiomyocytes in both DOX-stimulated H9c2 cells and mice. These benefits may be attributed in part to the decrease in GSK-3β expression and subsequent reduction in NF-κB p65 activation. Overall, our findings revealed that the pharmacological targeting of GSK-3β may offer a promising therapeutic approach for alleviating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",

Thanks in part to their intrinsic low cytotoxicity, the effects of the flavonoid family in the prevention and treatment of various human cancers, both in vitro and in vivo, have received increasing attention in recent years. It is well documented that Apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), among other flavonoids, is able to modulate key signaling molecules involved in the initiation of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, including JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, as well as the oncogenic non-coding RNA network. Based on these premises, the aim of this review is to emphasize some of the key events through which Apigenin suppresses cancer proliferation, focusing specifically on its ability to target key molecular pathways involved in angiogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs), cell cycle arrest, and cancer cell death.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is an oxidant linked with several human pathologies. Apigenin, a natural flavonoid known for its health benefits, remains unexplored in relation to ONOO- effects. This study investigated the potential of apigenin to structurally protect fibrinogen, an essential blood clotting factor, from ONOO--induced damage. METHODS: Multi-approach analyses were carried out where fibrinogen was exposed to ONOO- generation while testing the efficacy of apigenin. The role of apigenin against ONOO--induced modifications in fibrinogen was investigated using UV spectroscopy, tryptophan or tyrosine fluorescence, protein hydrophobicity, carbonylation, and electrophoretic analyses. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate that apigenin significantly inhibits ONOO--induced oxidative damage in fibrinogen. ONOO- caused reduced UV absorption, which was reversed by apigenin treatment. Moreover, ONOO- diminished tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence, which was effectively restored by apigenin treatment. Apigenin also reduced the hydrophobicity of ONOO--damaged fibrinogen. Moreover, apigenin exhibited protective effects against ONOO--induced protein carbonylation. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed that ONOO-treatment eliminated bands corresponding to fibrinogen polypeptide chains Aα and γ, while apigenin preserved these changes. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights, for the first time, the role of apigenin in structural protection of human fibrinogen against peroxynitrite-induced nitrosative damage. Our data indicate that apigenin offers structural protection to all three polypeptide chains (Aα, Bβ, and γ) of human fibrinogen. Specifically, apigenin prevents the dislocation or breakdown of the amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, lysine, arginine, proline, and threonine and also prevents the exposure of hydrophobic sites in fibrinogen induced by ONOO-.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress is an important pathological process in ischemic stroke (IS). Apigenin (APG) is a natural product with favorable antioxidative effects, and some studies have already demonstrated the antioxidative mechanism of APG in the treatment of IS. However, the mechanism of APG on DNA damage and repair after IS is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of APG on DNA repair after IS. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish a model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) on one side, and were pre-treated with gavage of APG (30, 60, or 120 mg/kg) for 7 days. One day after pMCAO, the brain tissues were collected. Cerebral infarct volume, brain water content, HE staining and antioxidant index were analyzed to evaluated the brain damage. Molecular Docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot were used to explore the potential proteins related to DNA damage repair. RESULTS: APG has a low binding score with DNA repair-related proteins. APG treatment has improved the volume of cerebral infarction and neurological deficits, reduced brain edema, and decreased parthanatos and apoptosis by inhibiting PARP1/AIF pathway. In addition, APG improved the antioxidative capacity through reducing reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and increasing glutathione and superoxide dismutase. Also, APG has reduced DNA damage- and cell death-related proteins such as PARP1, γH2A.X, 53BP1, AIF, cleaved caspase3, Cytochrome c, and increased DNA repair by BRCA1 and RAD51 through homologous recombination repair, and reduced non-homologous end link repair by KU70. CONCLUSION: APG can improve nerve damage after IS, and these protective effects were realized by reducing oxidative stress and DNA damage, and improving DNA repair."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retinal ischemia/reperfusion (RIR) is implicated in various forms of optic neuropathies, yet effective treatments are lacking. RIR leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and subsequent vision loss, posing detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. Apigenin (API), derived from a wide range of sources, has been reported to exert protective effects against ischemia/reperfusion injuries in various organs, such as the brain, kidney, myocardium, and liver. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of API and its underlying mechanisms on RGC degeneration induced by retinal ischemia/reperfusion (RIR). METHODS: An in vivo model was induced by anterior chamber perfusion following intravitreal injection of API one day prior to the procedure. Meanwhile, an in vitro model was established through 1% oxygen and glucose deprivation. The neuroprotective effects of API were evaluated using H&E staining, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), Fluoro-Gold retrograde labeling, and Photopic negative response (PhNR). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to observe mitochondrial crista morphology and integrity. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of API, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, flow cytometry assay, western blot, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, JC-1 kit assay, dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay, as well as TMRE and Mito-tracker staining were conducted. RESULTS: API treatment protected retinal inner plexiform layer (IPL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC), and improved the function of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Additionally, API reduced RGC apoptosis and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release by upregulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, while downregulating Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, API increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and decreased extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These effects were achieved by enhancing mitochondrial function, restoring mitochondrial cristae morphology and integrity, and regulating the expression of OPA1, MFN2, and DRP1, thereby regulating mitochondrial dynamics involving fusion and fission. CONCLUSION: API protects RGCs against RIR injury by modulating mitochondrial dynamics, promoting mitochondrial fusion and fission.",

      "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic multifactorial disorder of the ocular surface caused by tear film dysfunction and constitutes one of the most common ocular conditions worldwide. However, its treatment remains unsatisfactory. While artificial tears are commonly used to moisturize the ocular surface, they do not address the underlying causes of DED. Apigenin (APG) is a natural product with anti-inflammatory properties, but its low solubility and bioavailability limit its efficacy. Therefore, a novel formulation of APG loaded into biodegradable and biocompatible nanoparticles (APG-NLC) was developed to overcome the restricted APG stability, improve its therapeutic efficacy, and prolong its retention time on the ocular surface by extending its release. APG-NLC optimization, characterization, biopharmaceutical properties and therapeutic efficacy were evaluated. The optimized APG-NLC exhibited an average particle size below 200 nm, a positive surface charge, and an encapsulation efficiency over 99 %. APG-NLC exhibited sustained release of APG, and stability studies demonstrated that the formulation retained its integrity for over 25 months. In vitro and in vivo ocular tolerance studies indicated that APG-NLC did not cause any irritation, rendering them suitable for ocular topical administration. Furthermore, APG-NLC showed non-toxicity in an epithelial corneal cell line and exhibited fast cell internalization. Therapeutic benefits were demonstrated using an in vivo model of DED, where APG-NLC effectively reversed DED by reducing ocular surface cellular damage and increasing tear volume. Anti-inflammatory assays in vivo also showcased its potential to treat and prevent ocular inflammation, particularly relevant in DED patients. Hence, APG-NLC represent a promising system for the treatment and prevention of DED and its associated inflammation.",

      "abstract": "The neuronal and renal deteriorations observed in patients exposed to methotrexate (MTX) therapy highlight the need for medical interventions to counteract these complications. Boswellic acid (BA) and apigenin (APG) are natural phytochemicals with prominent neuronal and renal protective impacts in various ailments. However, their impacts on MTX-provoked renal and hippocampal toxicity have not been reported. Thus, the present work is tailored to clarify the ability of BA and APG to counteract MTX-provoked hippocampal and renal toxicity. BA (250 mg/kg) or APG (20 mg/kg) were administered orally in rats once a day for 10 days, while MTX (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered once on the sixth day of the study. At the histopathological level, BA and APG attenuated MTX-provoked renal and hippocampal aberrations. They also inhibited astrocyte activation, as proven by the inhibition of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These impacts were partially mediated via the activation of autophagy flux, as proven by the increased expression of beclin1, LC3-II, and the curbing of p62 protein, alongside the regulation of the p-AMPK/mTOR nexus. In addition, BA and APG displayed anti-inflammatory features as verified by the damping of NOD-2 and p-NF-κB p65 to reduce TNF-α, IL-6, and NLRP3/IL-1β cue. These promising effects were accompanied with a notable reduction in one of the gap junction proteins, connexin-43 (Conx-43). These positive impacts endorse BA and APG as adjuvant modulators to control MTX-driven hippocampal and nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Studying the involvement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically α7-nAChRs, in neuropsychiatric brain disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has gained a growing interest. The flavonoid apigenin (APG) has been confirmed in its pharmacological action as a positive allosteric modulator of α7-nAChRs. However, there is no research describing the pharmacological potential of APG in ASD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the subchronic systemic treatment of APG (10-30 mg/kg) on ASD-like repetitive and compulsive-like behaviors and oxidative stress status in the hippocampus and cerebellum in BTBR mice, utilizing the reference drug aripiprazole (ARP, 1 mg/kg, i.p.). BTBR mice pretreated with APG (20 mg/kg) or ARP (1 mg/g, i.p.) displayed significant improvements in the marble-burying test (MBT), cotton-shredding test (CST), and self-grooming test (SGT) (all p < 0.05). However, a lower dose of APG (10 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to modulate behaviors in the MBT or SGT, but significantly attenuated the increased shredding behaviors in the CST of tested mice. Moreover, APG (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.) and ARP (1 mg/kg) moderated the disturbed levels of oxidative stress by mitigating the levels of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the hippocampus and cerebellum of treated BTBR mice. In patch clamp studies in hippocampal slices, the potency of choline (a selective agonist of α7-nAChRs) in activating fast inward currents was significantly potentiated following incubation with APG. Moreover, APG markedly potentiated the choline-induced enhancement of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. The observed results propose the potential therapeutic use of APG in the management of ASD. However, further preclinical investigations in additional models and different rodent species are still needed to confirm the potential relevance of the therapeutic use of APG in ASD."

Epigenetic regulators play a crucial role in the progression and metastasis by modulating the expression of anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptotic markers and related miRNAs in TNBC cells. We have investigated the anti-TNBC potential of dietary flavonoid 'Apigenin' and its combination with Vorinostat on MDA-MB-231 cells. At Apigenin generated ROS, inhibited cell migration, arrested the cell cycle at subG0/G1 phases, and induced apoptotic-mediated cell death. Apigenin reduced the expression of the class-I HDACs at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In the immunoblotting study, Apigenin has upregulated pro-apoptotic markers and downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins. Apigenin inhibited the enzymatic activity of HDAC/DNMT and increased HAT activity. Apigenin has manifested its effect on miRNA expression by upregulating the tumor-suppressor miR-200b and downregulation oncomiR-21. Combination study reduced the growth of TNBC cells synergistically by modulating the expression of epigenetic and apoptotic regulators. Molecular docking and MD simulations explored the mechanism of catalytic inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC3 and supported the in-vitro studies. The overall studies demonstrated an anti-TNBC potential of Apigenin and may help to design an effective strategy to treat metastatic phenotype of TNBC.",

Luteolin, apigenin, and chrysin are three flavones with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but whether they inhibit lipotoxicity-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation was unclear. To address this question, we used J774A.1 macrophages and Kupffer cells stimulated with 100 μM palmitate (PA) in the presence or absence of 20 μM of each flavone. PA increased p-PERK, p-IRE1α, p-JNK1/2, CHOP, and TXNIP as well as p62 and LC3-II expression and induced autophagic flux damage. Caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release were also noted after 24 h of exposure to PA. In the presence of the PERK inhibitor GSK2656157, PA-induced CHOP and TXNIP expression and caspase-1 activation were mitigated. Compared with PA treatment alone, Bcl-2 coupled to beclin-1 was elevated and autophagy was reversed by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. With luteolin, apigenin, and chrysin treatment, PA-induced ROS production, ER stress, TXNIP expression, autophagic flux damage, and apoptosis were ameliorated. Moreover, TXNIP binding to NLRP3 and IL-1β release in response to LPS/PA challenge were reduced. These results suggest that luteolin, apigenin, and chrysin protect hepatic macrophages against PA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and autophagy damage by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a systemic age-related disease characterized by reduced bone mass and microstructure deterioration, leading to increased risk of bone fragility fractures. Osteoporosis is a worldwide major health care problem and there is a need for preventive approaches. METHODS AND RESULTS: Apigenin and Rutaecarpine are plant-derived antioxidants identified through functional screen of a natural product library (143 compounds) as enhancers of osteoblastic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal stem cells (hBMSCs). Global gene expression profiling and Western blot analysis revealed activation of several intra-cellular signaling pathways including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and TGFβ. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK using PF-573228 (5 μM) and TGFβ using SB505124 (1μM), diminished Apigenin- and Rutaecarpine-induced osteoblast differentiation. In vitro treatment with Apigenin and Rutaecarpine, of primary hBMSCs obtained from elderly female patients enhanced osteoblast differentiation compared with primary hBMSCs obtained from young female donors. Ex-vivo treatment with Apigenin and Rutaecarpine of organotypic embryonic chick-femur culture significantly increased bone volume and cortical thickness compared to control as estimated by μCT-scanning. DISCUSSION: Our data revealed that Apigenin and Rutaecarpine enhance osteoblastic differentiation, bone formation, and reduce the age-related effects of hBMSCs. Therefore, Apigenin and Rutaecarpine cellular treatment represent a potential strategy for maintaining hBMSCs health during aging and osteoporosis.",

In the current study, apigenin was developed as SNEDDS to solve its dissolution problem and enhance oral bioavailability and antioxidant potential. SNEDDS were prepared by mixing Gelucire 44/14, Tween 80, and PEG 400 under controlled conditions. The droplet of diluted SNEDDS demonstrated a spherical shape with a size of less than 100 nm and a neutral charge. The very fast self-emulsification was obtained within 32 s, and the transmittance values exceeded 99%. The highest drug loading was 90.10 ± 0.24% of the initial load with the highest %encapsulation efficiency of 84.20 ± 0.03%. FT-IR and DSC spectra showed no interaction between components. The dissolution in buffer pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8 showed significantly higher dissolved apigenin than the apigenin coarse powder. The dissolution profiles were fitted to the Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetics. The cellular antioxidant activities in Caco-2 cells were approximately 52.25-54.64% compared to no treatment and were higher than the apigenin coarse powder (12.70%). Our work highlights the potential of SNEDDS to enhance the dissolution and permeability of apigenin and promote antioxidant efficacy, which has a strong chance of being developed as a bioactive compound for nutraceuticals.",

      "abstract": "Flavonoids exhibit health-promoting benefits against multiple chronic diseases, including cancer. Apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), one flavonoid present in fruits and vegetables, is potentially applicable to chemoprevention. Despite considerable progress in the therapeutic regimen of liver cancer, its prognosis remains poor. MED28, a Mediator subunit for transcriptional activation, is implicated in the development of several types of malignancy; however, its role in liver cancer is unknown at present. In liver cancer, the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is one major pathway involved in the oncogenic process. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of apigenin and MED28 in AKT/mTOR signaling in liver cancer. We first identified a connectivity score of 92.77 between apigenin treatment and MED28 knockdown in several cancer cell lines using CLUE, a cloud-based software platform to assess connectivity among compounds and genetic perturbagens. Higher expression of MED28 predicted a poorer survival prognosis; MED28 expression in liver cancer tissue was significantly higher than that of normal tissue, and it was positively correlated with tumor stage and grade in The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Cancer (TCGA-LIHC) data set. Knockdown of MED28 induced cell cycle arrest and suppressed the AKT/mTOR signaling in two human liver cancer cell lines, HepG2 and Huh 7, accompanied by less lipid accumulation and lower expression and nuclear localization of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Apigenin inhibited the expression of MED28, and the effect of apigenin mimicked that of the MED28 knockdown. On the other hand, the AKT/mTOR signaling was upregulated when MED28 was overexpressed. These data indicated that MED28 was associated with the survival prognosis and the progression of liver cancer by regulating AKT/mTOR signaling and apigenin appeared to inhibit cell growth through MED28-mediated mTOR signaling, which may be applicable as an adjuvant of chemotherapy or chemoprevention in liver cancer."

Considering that hypoxia is associated with the malignant phenotypes in cervical cancer, this study aimed to uncover whether A7G exhibits suppressive effects on the hypoxia-induced malignant phenotype of cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells). Compared to normoxia, hypoxia can enhance the malignant phenotypes of HeLa cells, including cell proliferation, reduced sensitivity against chemotherapeutic agents (oxaliplatin and paclitaxel), cancer stemness, migration, and invasion. A7G intervention (20, 40, and 60 μM) could impair these malignant phenotypes of HeLa cells and upregulate the expression level of total and nuclear p16 proteins. Molecular docking analysis showed the interaction between anion exchanger 1 and A7G. In p16-silencing HeLa cells, the anticancer effects of A7G were absent. Therefore, hypoxia derives malignant phenotypes of HeLa cells, which could be impeded by A7G in a p16-dependent manner."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the colon, with symptomatology influenced by factors including environmental, genomic, microbial, and immunological interactions. Gut microbiota dysbiosis, characterized by bacterial population alterations, contributes to intestinal homeostasis disruption and aberrant immune system activation, thereby exacerbating the inflammatory state. This study assesses the therapeutic efficacy of intraperitoneal (IP) injected flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, and xanthohumol) in the reduction of inflammatory parameters and the modulation of the gut microbiota in a murine model of ulcerative colitis. Flavonoids interact with gut microbiota by modulating their composition and serving as substrates for the fermentation into other anti-inflammatory bioactive compounds. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of luteolin and xanthohumol treatment in enhancing the relative abundance of anti-inflammatory microorganisms, thereby attenuating pro-inflammatory species. Moreover, all three flavonoids exhibit efficacy in the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, with luteolin strongly demonstrating utility in alleviating associated physical UC symptoms. This suggests that this molecule is a potential alternative or co-therapy to conventional pharmacological interventions, potentially mitigating their adverse effects. A limited impact on microbiota is observed with apigenin, and this is attributed to its solubility constraints via the chosen administration route, resulting in its accumulation in the mesentery.",

Mining natural product transcriptome databases for bioactive ingredients, which can reverse disease-associated transcriptomic phenotypes, holds promise as an effective approach for drug discovery. To identify disease-associated transcriptomic changes, we performed RNA-sequencing on bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced cholestatic liver fibrosis mice, as well as PBC and PSC patients, and found that PANoptosis and activation of type-I interferon (IFN) signaling were observed in BDL mice and patients with PBC and PSC. We then established a transcriptotype-driven screening system based on HERB and ITCM databases. Among 283 natural ingredients screened, apigenin (Api), which is widely distributed in varieties of food and medicinal plants, was screened out by our screen system since it reversed the expression pattern of key genes associated with PANoptosis and type-I IFN responses. In BDL, Abcb4-/-, and DDC-fed mice, Api effectively ameliorated liver injuries, inflammation, and fibrosis. It also protected cholangiocytes from bile acid-stimulated PANoptosis, thus alleviating damage-associated molecular pattern-mediated activation of TBK1-NF-κB in macrophages. Additionally, Api directly inhibited type-I IFN-induced downstream inflammatory responses. Our study demonstrated the pathogenic roles of PANoptosis and type-I IFN signaling in cholestatic liver fibrosis and verified the feasibility of transcriptotype-based drug screening. Furthermore, this study revealed a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of Api and identified it as a promising candidate for the treatment of cholestatic liver fibrosis."

      "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a formidable challenge due to its low sensitivity to many chemotherapeutic drugs and a relatively low overall survival rate in clinical practice. Photothermal therapy has recently garnered substantial interest in cancer treatment, owing to its swift therapeutic effectiveness and minimal impact on normal cells. Metal-polyphenol nanostructures have recently garnered significant attention as photothermal transduction agents due to their facile preparation and favorable photothermal properties. In this study, we employed a coordinated approach involving Fe3+ and apigenin, a polyphenol compound, to construct the nanostructure (nFeAPG), with the assistance of β-CD and DSPE-PEG facilitating the formation of the complex nanostructure. In vitro research demonstrated that the formed nFeAPG could induce cell death by elevating intracellular oxidative stress, inhibiting antioxidative system, and promoting apoptosis and ferroptosis, and near infrared spectrum irradiation further strengthen the therapeutic outcome. In 4T1 tumor bearing mice, nFeAPG could effectively accumulate into tumor site and exhibit commendable control over tumor growth. Futher analysis demonstrated that nFeAPG ameliorated the suppressed immune microenvironment by augmenting the response of DC cells and T cells. This study underscores that nFeAPG encompasses a multifaceted capacity to combat TNBC, holding promise as a compelling therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment.",

Apigenin, a flavonoid isolated from plants, has beneficial effects on insulin resistance; however, its regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of apigenin on insulin resistance. In Huh7 cells, treatment with apigenin decreased the mRNA expression of fetuin-A by decreasing reactive oxygen species-mediated casein kinase 2α (CK2α)-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B activation; besides, apigenin decreased the levels of CK2α-dependent fetuin-A phosphorylation and thus promoted fetuin-A degradation through the autophagic pathway, resulting in a decrease in the protein levels of fetuin-A. Moreover, apigenin prevented the formation of the fetuin-A-insulin receptor (IR) complex and thereby rescued the PA-induced impairment of the insulin signaling pathway, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of IR substrate-1 and Akt, and translocation of glucose transporter 2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Similar results were observed in the liver of HFD-fed mice treated with apigenin. Collectively, our findings revealed that apigenin ameliorates obesity-induced insulin resistance in the liver by targeting fetuin-A.",

      "abstract": "NAD+, a pivotal coenzyme central to metabolism, exhibits a characteristic decline with age. In mice, NAD+ levels can be elevated via treatment with apigenin, a natural flavonoid that inhibits the NAD+-consuming glycoprotein CD38. In animal models, apigenin positively impacts both sleep and longevity. For example, apigenin improves learning and memory in older mice, reduces tumor proliferation in a mouse xenograft model of triple-negative breast cancer, and induces sedative effects in mice and rats. Moreover, apigenin elongates survival in fly models of neurodegenerative disease and apigenin glycosides increase lifespan in worms. Apigenin's therapeutic potential is underscored by human clinical studies using chamomile extract, which contains apigenin as an active ingredient. Collectively, chamomile extract has been reported to alleviate anxiety, improve mood, and relieve pain. Furthermore, dietary apigenin intake positively correlates with sleep quality in a large cohort of adults. Apigenin's electron-rich flavonoid structure gives it strong bonding capacity to diverse molecular structures across receptors and enzymes. The effects of apigenin extend beyond CD38 inhibition, encompassing agonistic and antagonistic modulation of various targets, including GABA and inflammatory pathways. Cumulatively, a large body of evidence positions apigenin as a unique molecule capable of influencing both aging and sleep. Further studies are warranted to better understand apigenin's nuanced mechanisms and clinical potential."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical indexes are often selected as relevant factors for constructing prognostic models of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) patients, while factors related to therapeutic targets are less frequently included. As Apigenin (API) shows anti-tumor properties in many tumors, in this study, we construct a novel prognostic model for TSCC patients based on Apigenin-associated genes through transcriptomic analysis. METHODS: The effect of Apigenin (API) on the cell characteristics of TSCC cells was measured by several phenotype experiments. RNA-seq was executed to ensure differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in squamous cell carcinoma-9 (SCC-9) cells after API treatment. Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry were performed to verify the expression of API-related genes. Then, combined with the gene expression data and relevant individual information of TSCC samples acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), an API-related model was built through Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and a nomogram and calibration curve were created to forecast patient outcomes to improve the clinical suitability of the API-related signature. The relationships between the two risk groups and function enrichment, immune infiltration characteristics, and drug susceptibility were analyzed. RESULTS: We demonstrated that API could inhibit the malignant behavior of TSCC cells. Among API-related genes, TSCC cells treated with API, compared to the control group, have higher levels of transmembrane protein 213 (TMEM213) and G protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158), and lower levels of caspase 14 (CASP14) and integrin subunit alpha 5 (ITGA5). An 7 API-associated gene model was built through Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression that could direct TSCC prognostic status and tumor immune cell infiltration. In addition, we acquired 6 potential therapeutic agents for TSCC based on the prognostic model. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggested the inhibition effect of API on TSCC cells and provided a novel prognostic model combined with therapeutic factors that can guide the prognosis of TSCC and clinical decision-making in TSCC.",

Combinational therapies help reduce unexpected off-target effects and accelerate therapeutic efficacy. Sorafenib- an FDA-approved drug for liver cancer, has multiple limitations. Therefore, it is recommended to identify an agent that increases its effectiveness and reduces toxicity. In this regard, Apigenin, a plant flavone, would be an excellent option to explore. METHODS: We used in silico, in vitro, and animal models to explore our hypothesis. For the in vitro study, HepG2 and Huh7 cells were exposed to Apigenin (12-96 μM) and Sorafenib (1-10 μM). For the in vivo study, Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (25 mg/kg) induced tumor-bearing animals were given Apigenin (50 mg/kg) or Sorafenib (10 mg/kg) alone and combined. Apigenin's bioavailability was checked by UPLC. Tumor nodules were studied macroscopically and by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Biochemical analysis, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR were done. RESULTS: The results revealed Apigenin's good bioavailability. In silico study showed binding affinity of both chemicals with p53, NANOG, ß-Catenin, c-MYC, and TLR4. We consistently observed a better therapeutic efficacy in combination than alone treatment. Combination treatment showed i) better cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and cell cycle arrest of tumor cells, ii) tumor growth reduction, iii) increased expression of p53 and decreased Cd10, Nanog, ß-Catenin, c-Myc, Afp, and Tlr4. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Apigenin could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Sorafenib against liver cancer and may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating HCC. However, further research is imperative to gain more in-depth mechanistic insights."

In addition, API significantly reduced reactive oxygen species, abnormal distribution of mitochondria, early apoptosis in ageing oocytes, increased glutathione, and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate levels in ageing oocytes. Importantly, API increased the embryonic development rate in aged oocytes. We also examined molecular changes, finding decreased sirtuin 1 expression in in-vitro postovulatory oocytes, but API reversed this effect.

In vivo by establishing a xenograft tumor model, using immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry to study the inhibitory effect of apigenin on solid breast tumors and its effect on the tumor immune microenvironment. The results showed that API can induce breast cancer cell apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 pathway and can improve the tumor immune microenvironment in mice with breast tumors, thereby inhibiting the growth of breast cancer.

The use of apigenin may prevent the development and progression of diabetes-related injuries. The current study aims to review the effects of apigenin in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: In this review, a systematic search was performed based on PRISMA guidelines for obtaining all relevant studies on \"the effects of apigenin against diabetic nephropathy\" in various electronic databases up to September 2022. Ninety-one articles were obtained and screened in accordance with the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven eligible articles were finally included in this review. RESULTS: The experimental findings revealed that hyperglycemia led to the decreased cell viability of kidney cells and body weight loss and an increased kidney weight of rats; however, apigenin administration had a reverse effect on these evaluated parameters. It was also found that hyperglycemia could induce alterations in the biochemical and renal function-related parameters as well as histopathological injuries in kidney cells or tissue; in contrast, the apigenin administration could ameliorate the hyperglycemia-induced renal adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the use of apigenin could mitigate diabetes-induced renal adverse effects, mainly through its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Since the findings of this study are based on experimental studies, suggesting the use of apigenin (as a nephroprotective agent) against diabetic nephropathy requires further clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is a serious public health concern worldwide, and nervous system (NS) cancers are among the most life-threatening malignancies. Efforts have been devoted to introduce natural anticancer agents with minimal side effects. Apigenin is an edible flavonoid that is abundantly found in many vegetables and fruits. Various pharmaceutical activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects have been reported for apigenin. This review provides insights into the therapeutic effects of apigenin and flavonoids with similar structure on glioblastoma and neuroblastoma. Current evidence indicates that apigenin has the unique ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, neurogenic, and neuroprotective effects have made this flavonoid a great option for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Meanwhile, apigenin has low toxicity on normal neuronal cells, while induces cytotoxicity on NS cancer cells via triggering several signal pathways and molecular targets. Anticancer effects of apigenin have been contributed to various mechanisms such as induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibition of migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Although apigenin is a promising pharmaceutical agent, its low bioavailability is an important issue that must be solved before introducing to clinic. Recently, nano-delivery of apigenin by liposomes and poly lactic-co-glycolide nanoparticles has greatly improved functionality of this agent. Hence, investigating pharmaceutical effects of apigenin-loaded nanocarriers on NS cancer cell lines and animal models is recommended for future studies.",

      "abstract": "Aluminium (AL) is a strong environmental neurotoxin linked to neurodegenerative disorders. Widespread industrial use leads to its presence in water systems, causing bioaccumulation in organisms. This, in turn, results in the bioaccumulation of AL in various organisms. Several studies have highlighted the benefits of enhanced physical activity in combating neurodegenerative diseases. Meanwhile widespread presence of apigenin in aquatic environment has been largely overlooked, in terms of its potential to counter AL-induced neurotoxicity. The combined impact of exercise and apigenin in mitigating the effects of AL-induced neurotoxicity in aquatic animals remains unexplored. Hence, the objective of this study is to determine whether the combined treatment of exercise and apigenin can effectively alleviate the chronic neurotoxicity induced by AL. Zebrafish that were exposed to AL showed behaviours resembling anxiety, increased aggression, unusual swimming pattern, and memory impairment, which are typical features observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like syndrome. Combined treatment of exercise and apigenin protects zebrafish from AL-induced neurotoxicity, which was measured by improvements in memory, reduced anxiety and aggression, and increased levels of antioxidant enzymes and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Furthermore, AL exposure is associated with increased expression of genes related to neuroinflammation and AD. However, synergistic effect of exercise and apigenin counteract this effect in AL-treated zebrafish. These findings suggest that AL is involved in neurodegenerative diseases in fish, which could affect the integrity of aquatic ecosystem. Hence, there is a strong correlation between enhanced physical activity, apigenin, and the well-being of the ecosystem.",

Molecular docking studies revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds between L22 and α-glucosidase and diverse interactions with neighboring amino acid residues. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of the L22-α-glucosidase complex. In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, treatment with L22 significantly lowered fasting blood glucose levels, and reduced insulin resistance, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, L22 showed a protective effect against oxidative stress in the liver and alleviated liver and pancreatic abnormalities. These results provide valuable insights into the mechanism of action of L22 and its potential applications to treat type 2 diabetes, and improve liver health.",

Apigenin-7-O-Glucoside (AGL) is a sugar derivative of apigenin natural product with various pharmacological activities to protect against intestinal diseases. In this study, we synthesized two amphiphilic molecules, namely DTPA-N10-10 and mPEG-TK-DA, which can scavenge free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). They were successfully encapsulated AGL through self-assembly, resulting in the formation of multi-site ROS scavenging nanoparticles called PDN@AGL. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that PDN@AGL could protect intestinal tissues by reducing lipid peroxidation, lowering ROS levels and inhibiting ferroptosis during II/R injury. Furthermore, our study revealed, for the first time, that the regulation of the ATF3/SLC7A11 pathway by PDN@AGL may play a crucial role in mitigating II/R injury. In conclusion, our study confirmed the beneficial effects of PDN@AGL in combating II/R injury through the ATF3/SLC7A11-mediated regulation of ferroptosis and oxidative stress. These findings lay the groundwork for the potential application of PDN@AGL in the treatment of II/R injury.",

A physicochemical analysis was conducted, which revealed process yields of 80.5-91% and APN content within 98.0-102.0%. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the structural preservation of APN, while Powder-XRD analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry indicated its transformation from a crystalline to an amorphous form. APN2 exhibited improved flow properties, a lower Angle of Repose, and Carr's Index, enhancing compressibility, with the Hausner Ratio confirming favorable flow properties for pharmaceutical applications. In vitro dissolution studies demonstrated superior performance with APN2, releasing up to 94.65% of the drug and revealing controlled release mechanisms with a lower mean dissolution time of 71.80 min and a higher dissolution efficiency of 19.2% compared to the marketed APN formulation. This signified enhanced dissolution and improved therapeutic onset. APN2 exhibited enhanced antioxidant activity; superior cytotoxicity against colon cancer cells (HCT-116), with a lower IC50 than APN pure; and increased antimicrobial activity. A stability study confirmed the consistency of APN2 after 90 days, as per ICH, with an f2 value of 70.59 for both test and reference formulations, ensuring reliable pharmaceutical development. This research underscores the potential of glycyrrhizin-apigenin solid dispersions for pharmaceutical and therapeutic applications, particularly highlighting the superior physicochemical properties, dissolution behavior, biological activities, and stability of APN2, while the development of a 3D printlet shell offers promise for enhanced drug delivery and therapeutic outcomes in colon cancer treatment, displaying advanced formulation and processing techniques."

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by its aggressiveness and resistance to cancer-specific transcriptome alterations. Alternative splicing (AS) is a major contributor to the diversification of cancer-specific transcriptomes. The TNBC transcriptome landscape is characterized by aberrantly spliced isoforms that promote tumor growth and resistance, underscoring the need to identify approaches that reprogram AS circuitry towards transcriptomes, favoring a delay in tumorigenesis or responsiveness to therapy. We have previously shown that flavonoid apigenin is associated with splicing factors, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNPA2). Here, we showed that apigenin reprograms TNBC-associated AS transcriptome-wide. The AS events affected by apigenin were statistically enriched in hnRNPA2 substrates. Comparative transcriptomic analyses of human TNBC tumors and non-tumor tissues showed that apigenin can switch cancer-associated alternative spliced isoforms (ASI) to those found in non-tumor tissues. Apigenin preferentially affects the splicing of anti-apoptotic and proliferation factors, which are uniquely observed in cancer cells, but not in non-tumor cells. Apigenin switches cancer-associated aberrant ASI in vivo in TNBC xenograft mice by diminishing proliferation and increasing pro-apoptotic ASI. In accordance with these findings, apigenin increased apoptosis and reduced tumor proliferation, thereby halting TNBC growth in vivo. Our results revealed that apigenin reprograms transcriptome-wide TNBC-specific AS, thereby inducing apoptosis and hindering tumor growth. These findings underscore the impactful effects of nutraceuticals in altering cancer transcriptomes, offering new options to influence outcomes in TNBC treatments.",

      "abstract": "Seizures are common in preterm newborns and are associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Current anticonvulsants have poor efficacy, and many have been associated with upregulation of apoptosis in the developing brain. Apigenin, a natural bioactive flavonoid, is a potent inhibitor of hyaluronidase and reduces seizures in adult animal models. However, its impact on perinatal seizures is unclear. In the present study, we examined the effect of apigenin and S3, a synthetic, selective hyaluronidase inhibitor, on seizures after cerebral ischemia in preterm fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation (98-99 days, term ~147 days). Fetuses received sham ischemia (n = 9) or ischemia induced by bilateral carotid occlusion for 25 min. Immediately after ischemia, fetuses received either a continuous infusion of vehicle (0.036% dimethyl sulfoxide, n = 8) or apigenin (50 µM, n = 6). In a pilot study, we also tested infusion of S3 (2 µM, n = 3). Fetuses were monitored continuously for 72 h after ischemia. Infusion of apigenin or S3 were both associated with reduced numbers of animals with seizures, total seizure time, and mean seizure burden. S3 was also associated with a reduction in the total number of seizures over the 72 h recovery period. In animals that developed seizures, apigenin was associated with earlier cessation of seizures. However, apigenin or S3 treatment did not alter recovery of electroencephalographic power or spectral edge frequency. These data support that targeting brain hyaluronidase activity with apigenin or S3 may be an effective strategy to reduce perinatal seizures following ischemia. Further studies are required to determine their effects on neurohistological outcomes.",

Traditional cancer therapies have many adverse effects and often result in unsatisfactory outcomes. Natural flavones, such as apigenin (APG), have demonstrated excellent antitumoral properties. However, they have a low aqueous solubility. To overcome this drawback, APG can be encapsulated in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). Therefore, we developed dual NLC encapsulating APG (APG-NLC) with a lipid matrix containing rosehip oil, which is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. METHODS: Optimisation, physicochemical characterisation, biopharmaceutical behaviour, and therapeutic efficacy of this novel nanostructured system were assessed. RESULTS: APG-NLC were optimized obtaining an average particle size below 200 nm, a surface charge of -20 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency over 99%. The APG-NLC released APG in a sustained manner, and the results showed that the formulation was stable for more than 10 months. In vitro studies showed that APG-NLC possess significant antiangiogenic activity in ovo and selective antiproliferative activity in several cancer cell lines without exhibiting toxicity in healthy cells. CONCLUSION: APG-NLC containing rosehip oil were optimised. They exhibit suitable physicochemical parameters, storage stability for more than 10 months, and prolonged APG release. Moreover, APG-NLC were internalised inside tumour cells, showing the capacity to cause cytotoxicity in cancer cells without damaging healthy cells.",

Apigenin is a bioactive plant compound that inhibits cellular aging processes and could protect against age-related cognitive dysfunction, but its mechanisms of action in the brain have not been comprehensively studied. We characterized brain transcriptome changes in young and old mice treated with apigenin in drinking water. We observed improved learning/memory in old treated mice, and our transcriptome analyses indicated that differentially expressed genes with aging and apigenin were primarily related to immune responses, inflammation, and cytokine regulation. Moreover, we found that genes/transcripts that were increased in old vs. young mice but downregulated with apigenin treatment in old animals were associated with immune activation/inflammation, whereas transcripts that were reduced with aging but increased with apigenin were related neuronal function and signaling. We also found that these transcriptome differences with aging and apigenin treatment were driven in part by glial cells. To follow up on these in vivo transcriptome findings, we studied aged astrocytes in vitro, and we found that apigenin reduced markers of inflammation and cellular senescence in these cells. Collectively, our data suggest that apigenin may protect against age-related cognitive dysfunction by suppressing neuro-inflammatory processes.",

Thus, a suitable delivery system is needed to overcome these limitations and improve the therapeutic efficiency. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a copolymer extensively utilized in drug delivery. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major extracellular matrix component and can specifically bind to CD44 on colon cancer cells. Herein, we aimed to prepare receptor-selective HA-coated PLGA nanoparticles (HA-PLGA-API-NPs) for colon cancers with high expression of CD44; chitosan (CS) was introduced into the system as an intermediate, simultaneously binding HA and PLGA through electrostatic interaction to facilitate a tighter connection between them. API was encapsulated in PLGA to obtain PLGA-API-NPs, which were then sequentially coated with CS and HA to form HA-PLGA-API-NPs. HA-PLGA-API-NPs had a stronger sustained-release capability. The cellular uptake of HA-PLGA-API-NPs was enhanced in HT-29 cells with high expression of CD44. In vivo, HA-PLGA-API-NPs showed enhanced targeting specificity towards the HT-29 ectopic tumor model in nude mice in comparison with PLGA-API-NPs. Overall, HA-PLGA-API-NPs were an effective drug delivery platform for API in the treatment of colon cancers with high expression of CD44.",

In vitro studies in which Caco-2 cell monolayers were incubated with different concentrations of flavonoids found that the flavonoid-treated group exhibited increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) at high concentrations, indicating a protective effect on the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. In vivo studies showed that flavonoids significantly attenuated inflammatory levels in both chronic and acute hapten-mediated experimental colitis models in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the level of proinflammatory cytokines in the colon tissue were significantly reduced. Interestingly, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines were also dramatically increased. Finally, flavonoids were found to positively modulate the composition of the gut microbiota in the colon. Therefore, a combination of flavonoids could be a promising therapeutic agent for the future adjunctive treatment of IBD.",

      "abstract": "Colon cancer (CC) is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide. Oncologists are facing challenges such as development of drug resistance and lack of suitable drug options for CC treatment. Flavonoids are a group of natural compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based foods. According to research, they have a potential role in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Apigenin is a flavonoid that is present in many fruits and vegetables. It has been used as a natural antioxidant for a long time and has been considered due to its anticancer effects and low toxicity. The results of this review study show that apigenin has potential anticancer effects on CC cells through various mechanisms. In this comprehensive review, we present the cellular targets and signaling pathways of apigenin indicated to date in in vivo and in vitro CC models. Among the most important modulated pathways, Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, JNK, STAT3, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, PKM2, and NF-kB have been described. Furthermore, apigenin suppresses the cell cycle in G2/M phase in CC cells. In CC cells, apigenin-induced apoptosis is increased by inhibiting the formation of autophagy. According to the results of this study, apigenin appears to have the potential to be a promising agent for CC therapy, but more research is required in the field of pharmacology and pharmacokinetics to establish the apigenin effects and its dosage for clinical studies."

      "abstract": "Apigenin is the active ingredient in Ludangshen. Although previous studies reported the cardioprotective actions of apigenin against doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiomyopathy, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Since apigenin beneficially regulates various aspects of mitochondrial function and dynamics, we asked whether apigenin improves heart function in mice with Dox-induced cardiomyopathy by regulating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Co-administration of apigenin significantly restored heart function, reduced myocardial swelling, inhibited cardiac inflammation, increased cardiac transcription of UPRmt-related genes, and promoted cardiomyocyte survival in Dox-treated mice. In turn, blockade of UPRmt abolished the mito- and cytoprotective effects of apigenin, evidenced by decreased ATP production, suppressed mitochondrial antioxidant capacity, and increased apoptosis, in Dox-treated, cultured HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, apigenin treatment prevented Dox-induced downregulation of Sirt1 and Atf5 expression, and the beneficial effects of apigenin were completely nullified in Sirt1 knockout (KO) mice or after siRNA-mediated Sirt1 knockdown in vitro. We thus provide novel evidence for a promotive effect of apigenin on UPRmt via regulation of the Sirt1/Atf5 pathway. Our findings uncover that apigenin seems to be an effective therapeutic agent to alleviate Dox-mediated cardiotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Several antiviral drugs are clinically approved to treat influenza that is a highly prevalent acute respiratory disease. However, emerging drug-resistant virus strains undermine treatment efficacy, highlighting the exigency for novel antiviral drugs to counter these drug-resistant strains. Plants and their derivates have been historically utilized as medicinal remedies, and extensive studies have evidenced the antiviral potential of phytochemicals. Notably, apigenin is a predominant flavonoid with minimal toxicity and substantial therapeutic effects in various disease models. Despite its many anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, and other beneficial bioactivities, existing reviews have yet to focus on apigenin's antiviral effects. Therefore, this review elucidates apigenin's therapeutic and antiviral properties in vitro and in vivo, discussing its mode of action and future prospects. Apigenin's remarkable inhibition by modulating multiple mechanisms against viruses has promising potential for novel plant-derived antiviral drugs and further clinical study developments.",
