      "abstract": "N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) is a medication and a widely used antioxidant in cell death research. Despite its somewhat obscure mechanism of action, its role in inhibiting ferroptosis is gaining increasing recognition. In this study, we demonstrate that NAC treatment rapidly replenishes the intracellular cysteine pool, reinforcing its function as a prodrug for cysteine. Interestingly, its enantiomer, N-acetyl-d-cysteine (d-NAC), which cannot be converted into cysteine, also exhibits a strong anti-ferroptotic effect. We further clarify that NAC, d-NAC, and cysteine all act as direct reducing substrates for GPX4, counteracting lipid peroxidation. Consequently, only GPX4-rather than system xc-, glutathione biosynthesis, or ferroptosis suppressor protein 1-is necessary for NAC and d-NAC to prevent ferroptosis. Additionally, we identify a broad range of reducing substrates for GPX4 in vitro, including β-mercaptoethanol. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of NAC and other potential GPX4-reducing substrates against ferroptosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sulfur (S) is essential for life while cadmium (Cd) is known to be both extremely toxic and ubiquitous in natural environments. Interactions between S and Cd from soil to plant could provide insights into the dynamics of environmental contaminants and the mechanisms of regulation. Geological sulfur from pyrite (FeS2) and atmospheric sulfur from coal combustion deposits (H2SO4) significantly affect soil acidification, potentially increasing the bioavailability of Cd. To investigate the influence of different sulfur sources on cadmium (Cd) uptake, transfer, accumulation, and the regulation of physiological responses in pepper, we conducted a controlled pot experiment. The study utilized yellow soil and 'Z2' line pepper (Capsicum spp.) as the test plant. We assessed the fresh weight, Cd concentration in various plant parts, and the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and cysteine (Cys) during the fruiting phase under varying concentrations of Cd. RESULTS: Under Cd stress, supplementation with FeS2 and H2SO4 markedly enhanced pepper growth, increasing biomass by over 30%. Among these, geological sulfur (FeS2) demonstrated a more pronounced effect compared to H2SO4. Overall, the cadmium content of each part of FeS2 treatment was lower than H2SO4 under cadmium-induced stress. And at medium cadmium level, a concentration of 100 mg/kg of FeS2 resulted in a 16.51% relative reduction in fruit Cd content from 2.12 mg/kg in the 1.5 mg/kg Cd treatment to 1.78 mg/kg. Both sulfur sources increased GSH and Cys content, particularly under high Cd stress, with FeS2 raising GSH and Cys levels by 3.33-61.87% and 43.29-71.94%, H2SO4 increased 15.65-66.43% and 48.02-74.58%, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). The highest GSH content occurred in leaves, whereas fruits had the highest Cys content. CONCLUSION: FeS2 and H2SO4 can promote pepper growth and enhancing the synthesis of GSH and Cys, which mitigates Cd toxicity. On the whole, the cadmium content of each part of FeS2 treatment was lower than H2SO4 under cadmium stress conditions.",

Because the nanomaterials can cross the blood-brain barrier, the knowledge of their effect in neural cells is also crucial. However, the exact mechanism of toxicity remains unclear. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the biological effect of TiO2 nanoparticles in neural cells. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the biological effect of TiO2 nanoparticles in neural cells. We used neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with 25 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 P25; 1-100 μg·mL-1; 24-72 h). We measured dehydrogenase activity, glutathione metabolism, DNA damage and mitochondrial respiration. After treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with TiO2 P25, we found a dose- and time-dependent decrease in dehydrogenase activity together with nuclear changes. Interestingly, 100 μg·mL-1 TiO2 P25 caused a significant increase of glutathione levels (p < 0.001) linked with increased glutamate-cysteine ligase expression after both 24 and 48 h. Furthermore, as the first study at all, we observed the significant decreases of mitochondrial respiration in SH-SY5Y cells caused by treatments with 10 and 100 μg·mL-1 TiO2 P25 after 48 and 72 h. In conclusion, our study brings new finding of occurrence of decreased mitochondrial respiration without glutathione depletion in SH-SY5Y cells contributing to the understanding of TiO2 P25 toxicity in neural cells."

      "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of enzymes detoxifying various harmful compounds by conjugating them with glutathione. While primarily beneficial, dysregulation of GST activity or specific isoforms can contribute to disease pathogenesis. The intricate balance of detoxification processes regulated by GSTs is pivotal in cellular homeostasis, whereby dysregulation in these mechanisms can have profound implications for human health. Certain GSTs neutralize carcinogens, shielding cells and potentially preventing tumorigenesis. Polymorphisms in specific GSTs may result in the accumulation of toxic metabolites, exacerbating oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, notably observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. They can also modulate signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, with aberrant activity potentially contributing to uncontrolled cell growth and resistance to cell death, thus promoting cancer development. They may also contribute to autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions. This knowledge is useful for designing therapeutic interventions and understanding chemoresistance due to GST polymorphisms. A variety of GST inhibitors have been developed and investigated, with researchers actively working on new inhibitors aimed at preventing off-target effects. By leveraging knowledge of the involvement of specific GST isoforms in disease pathogenesis across different populations, more effective and targeted therapeutics can be designed to enhance patient care and improve treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "The neurotoxicological consequences of chronic exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) at environmentally relevant concentrations remain poorly understood, particularly their impact on hippocampal neurons dysfunction. In this study, a mouse model co-exposed to PSNPs and/or luteolin (LUT) was replicated by intraperitoneal injection to investigate the mechanism and effective treatment of PSNPs induced striatal neurodegeneration. Here, we elucidated that PSNPs exposure induced striatal injury characterized by neuronal disorganization and mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. Notably, PSNPs triggered oxidative dysregulation and iron accumulation by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity and suppressing lipid peroxidation, leading to ferroptosis and neuroinflammation. Additionally, PSNPs exposure induced a decrease in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle imbalance by disrupting G6PD/glutathione-dependent pathway, leading to an imbalance in cellular energy metabolism. Our findings highlighted the role of the Piezo1/CaN/NFAT1 axis in PSNPs-induced ER Ca2 + homeostasis imbalance, which was effectively inhibited by LUT. Notably, LUT alleviated the susceptibility to striatal ferroptosis induced by PSNPs via the G6PD/glutathione axis. Collectively, our study provides critical insights into the neurotoxic mechanisms of PSNPs and establishes LUT as a agent against PSNPs-induced neurodegeneration. These findings underscore the urgent need for environmental regulation of nanoplastics and offer potential strategies for combating their health effects."

      "abstract": "Echinochloa phyllopogon, a malignant weed found in paddy fields, has developed resistance to many acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides. This resistance threatens the effectiveness and sustainability of herbicides. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are important detoxification enzymes responsible for herbicide resistance in plants. Here, we identified and characterized two GST genes (EpGST1 and EpGSTU6) that showed higher expression levels in resistant than in susceptible E. phyllopogon populations. Nucleotide sequence alignment showed that EpGST1 was identical in both the sensitive and resistant populations without any mutations. The HPLC-MS/MS results showed that the in vitro recombinant GST1 protein had a stronger ability to metabolize the herbicide penoxsulam than the empty vector or EpGSTU6. Overexpression of EpGST1 in Arabidopsis and rice significantly enhanced penoxsulam resistance. Peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities in the resistant population were significantly enhanced after penoxsulam treatment, and the contents of MDA were significantly increased. Similarly, in rice overexpressing EPGST1, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were significantly enhanced, and the contents of H2O2 were significantly decreased. The results of the subcellular localization study indicated that EpGST1 is a nuclear gene. These results suggest that EpGST1 plays a significant role in the evolution of penoxsulam resistance by enhancing herbicide metabolism in E. phyllopogon."

      "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 1000 loci where genetic variants correlate with kidney function. However, the specific genes, cell types, and mechanisms influenced by these genetic variants remain largely uncharted. Here, we identified glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) on chromosome 15 as affected by GWAS variants by analyzing human kidney gene expression and methylation information. Both CHAC1 RNA and protein were expressed in the loop of Henle region in mouse and human kidneys, and CHAC1 expression was higher in patients carrying disease risk variants. Using CRISPR technology, we created mice with a single functional copy of the Chac1 gene (Chac1+/-) that displayed no baseline phenotypic alterations in kidney structure or function. These mice demonstrated resilience to kidney disease in multiple models, including folic acid-induced nephropathy, adenine-induced chronic kidney disease, and uninephrectomy-streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. We further showed that CHAC1 plays a critical role in degrading the cellular antioxidant glutathione. Tubule cells isolated from Chac1+/- mice showed increased glutathione, decreased lipid peroxidation, improved cell viability, and protection against ferroptosis. Expression of ferroptosis-associated genes was also lower in mice with only one copy of Chac1. Higher CHAC1 protein also correlated with ferroptosis-related protein abundance in kidney biopsies from patients with kidney disease. This study positions CHAC1 as an important mediator of kidney disease that influences glutathione concentrations and ferroptosis, suggesting potential avenues to explore for the treatment of kidney diseases.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms by which oncogenic events alter metabolism will help identify metabolic weaknesses that can be targeted for therapy. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is essential for telomere maintenance in most cancers. Here, we show that TERT acts via the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) to upregulate glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH, reduced) in multiple cancer models, including glioblastoma (GBM). Genetic ablation of GCLC or pharmacological inhibition using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) reduces GSH synthesis from [U-13C]-glutamine in GBMs. However, GCLC inhibition drives de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis by upregulating the glutamine-utilizing enzymes glutaminase (GLS) and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotatase (CAD) in an MYC-driven manner. Combining BSO with the glutamine antagonist JHU-083 is synthetically lethal in vitro and in vivo and significantly extends the survival of mice bearing intracranial GBM xenografts. Collectively, our studies advance our understanding of oncogene-induced metabolic vulnerabilities in GBMs."

Following amustaline/glutathione pathogen-reduced (PR) RBC transfusion, small quantities of PR-RBC surface-bound acridine are detectable by flow cytometry. Concurrent biotin labeling was used to validate the acridine marker and track transfused PR-RBCs in SCD. METHODS: SCD patients (n = 6) on chronic transfusion therapy received three aliquots of different (2 μg/mL, 6 μg/mL, and 18 μg/mL) biotin-dose labeled RBCs during one transfusion episode. Aliquots were from one unit labeled before (Pre-PR) and after PR treatment (PR-RBC) and from a conventional RBC unit. The full RBC units (PR and conventional) were transfused, followed by the labeled aliquots from those units. Serial flow cytometry analyses for acridine- and biotin-labeled RBCs were performed on 10 occasions over 16 weeks. Acridine surface density was quantitated using calibrated beads. RESULTS: Mean acridine surface density was 5062 molecules/PR-RBC at 1-4 h post-transfusion and declined 84.5% within 7 days, remaining detectable (180 molecules/PR-RBC) at 16 weeks. The biotin-labeled PR-RBC aliquots (initial enrichment 0.6%-1.4%) demonstrated near-identical survival kinetics as the entire acridine-labeled PR-RBC units (initial enrichment 7.5%-13.7%). Pre-PR, PR, and Conventional RBCs revealed non-linear RBC survival kinetics, with similar 24-h post-transfusion recoveries (PTR24) and half-lives (T50), but PR-RBC mean predicted lifespan (mean [SD] 104.4 [4.7] days) was decreased by 9.3% (Pre-PR-RBCs 115.1 [7.2] days, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Survival of amustaline/glutathione PR-RBCs can be tracked in vivo by flow cytometry for RBC surface acridine with similar sensitivity as biotin, without additional processing or radiolabeling."

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent used to treat many types of cancer. Its use is limited because of the reported accompanied cardiotoxicity, which is driven by oxidative stress and inflammation. Herin, we explored the cardioprotective impact of reduced glutathione (GSH) against DOX-induced cardiac damage in a mice model and highlighted the dynamic interplay between pro-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms, with tissue damage markers and oxidative byproducts. Mice were divided into four groups and administered DOX, GSH, or a combination, and the outcomes were compared to untreated controls. DOX administration caused significant mortality, weight loss, elevated serum markers of cardiac injury (CK-MB and LDH), oxidative stress (MDA and iron), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23), and upregulated pro-inflammatory gene expression of STAT-3 and NFκB as well as downregulated gene expression of NRF-2 and HO-1. Histological analysis showed myocardial fibrosis, vacuolization, and apoptosis, as confirmed by a TUNEL assay. Meanwhile, treatment with GSH improved survival rate, attenuated weight loss, and restored cardiac function markers. Furthermore, GSH suppressed oxidative stress and inflammation, modulated gene expression, and declined histopathological damage. These findings demonstrated the multifaceted cardioprotection of GSH through the restoration of redox homeostasis and modulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. GSH supplementation emerges as a promising adjunct therapy to mitigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, offering a strategy to improve cardiac health in cancer patients undergoing doxorubicin chemotherapy.",

This study linked DE-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ferroptosis with lung epithelial disruption, also the protective potential of exogenous glutathione (GSH) administration was investigated. C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: filtered air (control), DE exposed, and DE+GSH (administered intranasally on alternate days). Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), lung tissues, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used for analysis. DE exposure significantly impaired lung function parameters as shown by AHR. Elevated ROS depleted the GSH/GSSG ratio and suppressed Nrf2 activity, disrupting antioxidant defense mechanisms, which were restored by GSH administration. DE-induced ROS acted as a key driver of ferroptosis, characterized by suppressed SLC7411 expression thereby decreased GSH synthesis and GPX-4 activity, inducing lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis was significantly mitigated by increased GSH pool, which restored GPX-4 levels and reduced lipid peroxidation. Concurrently, DE induced ROS promoted DNA damage and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells wherein GSH treatment preserved cell survival in DE exposed mice. The heightened DE-associated ROS further amplified inflammation, as shown by increased cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, TSLP, IL-33) and P-NF-κB activation. Activated inflammatory cascade disrupted tight junction proteins (claudins, occludin), resulted in weakened epithelial barrier and increased permeability. Lung barrier disruption was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry, corroborated with elevated albumin levels. GSH effectively restored tight junction integrity and preserved barrier function in DE+GSH mice lungs. In conclusion, DE-induced oxidative stress and ferroptosis-triggered inflammation compromised epithelial barrier promoting lung injury. Exogenous GSH administration showed potential in restoring DE-associated lung damage."

To overcome these limitations, we developed an innovative virus-like hollow mesoporous manganese nanocage, loaded with DHA and subsequently cloaked with red cell membrane, designed to trigger a tumor-microenvironment-responsive free radical generation, synergized with glutathione (GSH) exhaustion for enhanced CDT efficacy. Upon accumulation in tumor tissues via the enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effect, the high concentration of GSH in cancer cells initiates the degradation of the nanocages. This process specifically and efficiently released both Mn2+ and DHA while simultaneously depleting GSH. The released Mn2+ further catalyzed the conversion of DHA to generate large amounts of highly toxic carbon-center (•C) radicals accompanied by the generation of Mn4+. The •C radical generation led to severe mitochondria dysfunction and DNA damage, potentially causing cancer cell death. The concurrently generated Mn4+ continued to depelete intracellular GSH and induce lipid peroxidation, thereby weakening cancer cells' anti-oxidative defenses and amplifing oxidative stress. The viability of 4T1 cells treated with DHA@vhmMN@RM was significantly lower (about 30 %) than other groups. This work presents a novel nanosystem that specifically enhances the therapeutic effect of CDT by leveraging a tumor microenvironment-responsive free radical generation, coupled with GSH exhaustion, offering a new avenue for targeted drug delivery and synergistic cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins are a group of polyphenolic pigments that play essential biological roles and significantly influence the quality of agricultural produce. Bioinformatics approaches were employed to predict and identify potential genes involved in the sequestration of anthocyanins in Zicaitai (Brassica rapa var. purpuraria) utilizing data from the transcriptome database. RESULTS: In this study 0-hour light (dark) and 8-hour light treatments of Zicaitai were examined using transcriptome analysis. RNA-seq analysis indicates that 24 important anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, including 5 PAL, 3 4CL, 3 CHS, 3 CHI, 2 F3H, 1 DFR, 2 ANS, and 5 UGFT were significantly differentially expressed between 0-hour and 8-hour light treatment. The transcript levels of the glutathione S-transferase gene, BrGSTF12, were significantly higher at 8 h compared to 0 h. BrGSTF12 expression level correlated with the patterns of anthocyanins content in each tissue of Zicaitai. Functional complementation in the Arabidopsis tt19 mutant further demonstrated that BrGSTF12 was involved in the transport of anthocyanins. Additionally, expression analysis showed that BrMYB114 levels were significantly elevated at 8 h, and dual-luciferase assays confirmed that BrMYB114 effectively trans-activated the promoter of the BrGSTF12 gene. CONCLUSION: This study provides molecular evidence supporting the regulatory roles of BrGSTF12 and BrMYB114 in enhancing anthocyanin accumulation in Zicaitai under light induction. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind anthocyanin biosynthesis and transport, offering valuable insights that could aid in breeding anthocyanin-rich crops, and paving the way for new opportunities in crop development.",

Reduced glutathione (GSH) is considered as \"the master antioxidant\" and major detoxification agent. AIMS: To characterize the metabolomic changes of skin keratinocytes under the pollutant benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) challenge and investigate the interventional effects of glutathione amino acid precursors (GAP). METHODS: Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were challenged with BaP with or without GAP treatment. GSH/GSSG levels were measured by UPLC-MS/MS. Non-targeted metabolome analysis was conducted with UPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry. Transcriptomics analysis was performed using RNA-seq. DNA damage biomarker γ-H2AX was analyzed by western blot. Reconstructed pigmented skin equivalent models (pLSE) were used for evaluating phenotypical changes. RESULTS: One micromolar BaP exposure induced widespread metabolic reprogramming in in vitro NHEKs with over-represented differential metabolites in pathways including purine and pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, xenobiotic metabolism, methylation, and RNA modification, etc. GAP co-treatment improved GSH/GSSG ratio, reduced reactive BaP metabolites, and partially reversed BaP induced metabolic and transcriptomic alterations. Western blotting further confirmed that GAP treated samples showed reduced γ-H2AX staining. In pLSE models, GAP treatment significantly ameliorated BaP induced skin darkness and hyperpigmentation. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, GAP shows in vitro protective effects against BaP by maintaining GSH homeostasis, helping metabolic detoxification, reducing DNA damage, and is effective in preventing hyperpigmentation of skin models under pollution challenge.",

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play pivotal roles in detoxifying AFB1 by catalyzing the conjugation of AFBO with glutathione (GSH). Although there are over 20 GST isozymes that have been identified in chicken, GST isozymes involved in the detoxification process of AFB1 have not been identified yet. The objective of this study was to determine which GST isozymes played key role in detoxification of AFB1. RESULTS: A total of 17 pcDNA3.1(+)-GST isozyme plasmids were constructed and the GST isozyme genes were overexpressed by 80-2,500,000 folds in the chicken Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells. Compared to the AFB1 treatment, overexpression of GSTA2X, GSTA3, GSTT1L, GSTZ1-1, and GSTZ1-2 increased the cell viability by 6.5%-17.0% in LMH cells. Moreover, overexpression of five GST isozymes reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase and reactive oxygen species by 8.8%-64.4%, and 57.2%-77.6%, respectively, as well as enhanced the production AFBO-GSH by 15.8%-19.6%, thus mitigating DNA damage induced by AFB1. After comprehensive evaluation of various indicators, GSTA2X displayed the best detoxification effects against AFB1. GSTA2X was expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 and its enzymatic properties for catalyzing the conjugation of AFBO with GSH showed that the optimum temperature and pH were 20-25 °C and 7.6-8.6 as well as the enzymatic kinetic parameter Vmax was 0.23 nmol/min/mg and the Michaelis constant was 86.05 μmol/L with the AFB1 as substrate. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, GSTA2X, GSTA3, GSTT1L, GSTZ1-1, and GSTZ1-2 played key roles in AFB1 detoxification, which will provide new remediation strategies to prevent aflatoxicosis in chickens."

Glutathione, a thiol tripeptide plays a paradoxical role in cancer as intracellular glutathione (GSH) are voracious scavengers of free radicals produced by chemotherapy, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Cancer cells show Warburg effect, wherein the intracellular GSH levels are exceptionally enhanced to overcome the oxidative stress created by ROS/RNS production or by the other free radicals generated as side products of intracellular redox reactions. Therefore, redox resetting is essential to maintain the redox homeostasis for cell survival and their proliferation and trigger escalation of GSH levels. Nanotherapeutics have facilitated the targeted delivery of GSH-depleting agents in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and novel therapeutic interventions including chemodynamic therapy (CDT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), ferroptosis induction, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and immunotherapy are being explored. This review aims to compile the strategic role of GSH in cancer cells, the importance of nanotherapeutics for GSH depletion in cancer to target numerous forms of programmed cell death (PCD), including apoptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy.",

Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a crucial antioxidant enzyme that plays a role in regulating ferroptosis. It is also involved in a wide variety of biological processes, such as tumor cell growth invasion, migration, and resistance to drugs. This study comprehensively examined the role of GPX4 in NSCLC and investigated the clinical feasibility of targeting GPX4 for NSCLC treatment. We discovered that GPX4 influences the progression of NSCLC by modulating multiple signaling pathways, and that blocking GPX4 can trigger ferroptosis and increase the sensitivity to chemotherapy. As a result, GPX4 represents a prospective therapeutic target for NSCLC. Targeting GPX4 inhibits the development of NSCLC cells and decreases their resistance to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Glutathione (GSH), a non-enzymatic antioxidant in mammalian cells, plays an essential role in maintaining redox balance, mitigating oxidative stress, and preserving cellular homeostasis. Beyond its well-established function in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS), GSH serves as a critical regulator of ferroptosis-an iron-dependent form of cell death marked by excessive lipid peroxidation. Serving as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), GSH catalyzes the conversion of lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols, thereby preventing the accumulation of deleterious lipid oxidation products and halting the spread of oxidative damage. In cancer cells, upregulated GSH synthesis and GPX4 activity contribute to an enhanced antioxidant defense, countering oxidative stress provoked by increased metabolic demands and exposure to therapeutic agents such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. This ability of cancer cells to modulate their ferroptosis susceptibility through GSH metabolism underscores its potential as a therapeutic target. Additionally, GSH influences several key oncogenic and tumor-suppressive signaling pathways, including NFE2L2/NRF2, TP53/p53, NF-κB, Hippo, and mTOR, which collectively regulate responses to oxidative stress, affect metabolic processes, and modulate sensitivity to ferroptosis in cancer cells. This review explores recent advancements in understanding GSH's multifaceted role in ferroptosis, emphasizing its implications for cancer biology and therapeutic interventions.",

In this study, the role of glutathione (GSH) metabolism in C. pneumoniae growth and progeny production was studied in THP-1 macrophages and A549 epithelial cells. Results indicate that depletion of cellular GSH pools decreased C. pneumoniae replication, but only if the constituent amino acids were also sequestered from the culture. C. pneumoniae infection increased the expression of GSH biosynthetic genes but also upregulated ChaC1, an intracellular enzyme involved in GSH breakage. C. pneumoniae infection was found to increase PERK phosphorylation in THP-1 macrophages and chemical inhibition of PERK prevented the infection-induced upregulation of GSH biosynthesis and GSH degradation genes and suppressed C. pneumoniae replication. C. pneumoniae -induced ChaC1 upregulation was also suppressed by protein kinase R inhibitor or treatment with ISRIB, indicating an involvement of redundant pathways of the host cell stress response. The data suggest that C. pneumoniae requires amino acids derived from the host cell GSH pools to enable active bacterial replication."

Flow cytometry and transcriptomic analyses indicate that dysregulated GSH metabolism leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in NK cells, thereby impairing their antileukemic cytotoxicity and proliferative capacity. Notably, supplementation with glutathione reduced ethyl ester (GSHEE)-a GSH precursor-effectively restores GSH levels in AL-NK cells, enhancing mitochondrial activity, oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, GSHEE treatment activates the mTOR signaling pathway in NK cells, further promoting their function and proliferation. Overall, our study identifies dysregulated GSH metabolism as a key driver of NK cell dysfunction in acute leukemia and suggests that GSH-based interventions may provide a promising strategy to enhance NK cell-mediated immunotherapies.",

Conventional treatments often fail to prevent its progression. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Tithonia diversifolia zinc oxide nanoparticle emulsion (TDNP) in mitigating DN by enhancing antioxidant and immunomodulatory mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of TDNP on oxidative stress markers, inflammation, and insulin activity in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 24) were divided into four groups: control (saline), positive control (0.1% zinc oxide suspension), treatment (TDNP at 100 mg/kg body weight), and comparison (quercetin at 5 mg/kg body weight). DN was induced using STZ and nicotinamide. Blood glucose, creatinine, urea, gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were assessed. Oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx]), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α), and immunohistochemical indicators (anti-insulin, interferon-gamma [IFN-γ]) were measured. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: TDNP treatment significantly reduced blood glucose, creatinine, urea, γ-GT, and TNF-α levels (p ≤ 0.05), while increasing SOD, GPx, and anti-insulin levels compared with the positive control. Histopathological analysis showed decreased necrosis and inflammation in pancreatic and renal tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced anti-insulin and reduced IFN-γ expression in TDNP-treated rats, indicating improved immune regulation and oxidative stress mitigation. CONCLUSION: TDNP demonstrates potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, effectively improving glucose metabolism and kidney function in DN. These findings highlight TDNP as a promising therapeutic agent for managing DN."

This spectrum of hepatic disorders can progress to severe conditions, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, due to oxidative stress and sustained cellular injury. With limited pharmacological options, glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant, has shown promising potential in reducing oxidative stress, maintaining redox balance, and improving liver function. This literature review examines studies from 2014-2024 exploring GSH therapy in NAFLD patients. Eligible studies assessed GSH as the primary intervention for NAFLD in human subjects, reporting outcomes such as liver function or oxidative stress markers. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were eligible, while combination therapy studies were included if GSH's effect could be isolated. Exclusions applied to non-NAFLD studies, animal/in vitro models, and non-GSH antioxidant interventions. Analysis of three studies (totaling 109 participants) demonstrated consistent improvements in alanine transaminase (ALT) levels and reductions in oxidative stress markers like 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). However, small sample sizes and inconsistent protocols limit generalizability. Further large-scale RCTs are required to confirm GSH's efficacy, determine optimal dosing, and assess long-term effects. This literature review highlights GSH's potential as a novel NAFLD therapeutic strategy while emphasizing the need for further studies to refine its clinical application."

This species primarily causes infections of postoperative wounds and the urinary tract. Some isolates of M. morganii exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics due to multidrug resistance traits, complicating clinical treatment; thus, there is a growing need to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of this pathogen. METHODS: A total of 658 bacterial strains were isolated from anal fecal swabs from poultry and livestock and from the surrounding environment in Wenzhou, China, via plate streaking. The full genome sequences of the bacteria were obtained via next-generation sequencing platforms. The standard agar dilution method was employed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various antimicrobial agents. The resistance gene (fosA13) of the isolate was identified using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and confirmed via molecular cloning. The FosA13 protein encoded by the novel resistance gene fosA13 was expressed with the vector pCold I, and its enzyme kinetics parameters were characterized. The genetic background and evolutionary process of the sequence of this novel resistance gene were analyzed by means of bioinformatics methods. RESULTS: In this study, we identified a new chromosomally encoded fosfomycin resistance gene, designated fosA13, from the M. morganii isolate DW0548, which was isolated from poultry on a farm in Wenzhou, China. Compared with the control strain (pUCP19/DH5α), the recombinant strain carrying fosA13 (pUCP19-fosA13/DH5α) presented a fourfold increase in the MIC value for fosfomycin. The enzyme kinetics data of FosA13 revealed effective inactivation of fosfomycin, with a k cat /K m of (1.50 ± 0.02)×104 M-1·s-1. Among functionally characterized resistance proteins, FosA13 presented the highest amino acid (aa) homology (55.6%) with FosA. FosA13 also contained essential functional residues of FosA proteins. The isolate M. morganii DW0548 presented high MIC values (≥ 8 μg/mL) for 5 classes of antimicrobials, namely, aminoglycosides, β-lactams, quinolones, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, but only two functionally characteristic antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been identified in the complete genome: a β-lactam resistance gene (bla DHA-16) and a phenol resistance gene (catII). These findings indicate that in addition to the novel resistance gene identified in this work, other uncharacterized resistance mechanisms might exist in M. morganii DW0548. CONCLUSION: A novel chromosomal fosfomycin resistance gene, fosA13, was identified in an animal M. morganii isolate, and its enzymatic parameters were characterized. This protein shares the highest aa identity of 55.6% with the functionally characterized protein FosA and has all the essential functional residues of FosA proteins. Exploring more antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of this pathogen would help clinicians choose effective drugs to treat infectious diseases in animal husbandry and clinical practice and facilitate the development of methods to prevent the spread of resistance between bacteria of different species.",

      "abstract": "Glutathione (GSH), a naturally occurring tripeptide, plays an important role as an intracellular antioxidant in the physiological microenvironment and participates in redox balance, detoxification, and cellular and disease regulation. The unique structural features of GSH, including the reductive thiol and multiple coordination sites (carboxyl and amino group), make it a significant molecule not only in the physiological context but also as a ligand in the development of functional metal nanomaterials. In this context, GSH's role as a protective ligand and reducing agent in surface etching and ligand exchange reactions has been explored at the molecular level, expanding the diversity of GSH-protected metal nanomaterials. With photoluminescence (PL) as one of its most intriguing properties, investigations into GSH's influence on PL properties emphasize its multifaceted coordination capabilities in surface coating, charge transfer from electron-rich functional groups, chirality arising from its unique structure, and available conjugation sites. Moreover, the biocompatibility of GSH, combined with the synergistic effect of metal components, renders GSH-protected nanomaterials an \"Inseparable Duo\" highly suited for applications in bio-sensing, bio-imaging via PL radiative decay and anti-cancer bio-therapies through photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and radiotherapy. By exploring the multifaceted roles of GSH, this Perspective aims to highlight pathways including the encouragement of deeper synthetic exploration, innovative design at the bio-nano interface, and expanded nanobiomedical applications."

      "abstract": "Cuproptosis is a new copper-dependent form of regulated cell death and shows enormous promise in cancer therapy. However, its therapeutic performance is compromised by the strictly regulated copper metabolism and highly expressed intracellular glutathione (GSH). Herein, an intelligent nanoplatform (NSeMON-P@CuT/LipD) is rationally developed as a copper metabolic disrupter, GSH consumer, and Fenton-like reaction trigger for cancer cuproptosis/ferroptosis/apoptosis therapy. NSeMON-P@CuT/LipD is constructed from the preparation of diselenide-bridged mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles, and then pemetrexed (Pem) is loaded followed by surface deposition with a Cu2+-3,3'-dithiobis(propionohydrazide) (TPH) coordinated network and coating with a diclofenac (DC)-encapsulated liposome. In response to the specific tumor microenvironment, the obtained NSeMON-P@CuT/LipD can release DC, Cu2+, and Pem and simultaneously amplify cellular oxidative stress by consuming GSH and catalyzing endogenous H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Both liberated DC and augmented oxidative stress can inhibit glycolysis, reduce ATP level, and then block copper transporter ATP7B, resulting in metabolic disorders and the high retention of copper in cells for •OH generation. Moreover, the overloaded copper can promote dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase oligomerization and Fe-S cluster protein loss, thus evoking cuproptosis. Collectively, the augmented oxidative stress activates prominent ferroptosis, which cooperates with cuproptosis and Pem-mediated apoptosis to significantly inhibit the tumor growth of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. This study demonstrates feasible strategies to enhance tumor cuproptosis using a single nanoplatform and may also inspire the design of advanced cuproptosis-related therapies.",

Herein, iron atomically dispersed nanoparticles (Fe-N-C) were first reported as sonosensitizers with highly efficient ROS generation by overcoming TME limitations. Its peroxidase and catalase-like activities catalyze H2O2 to produce highly toxic ·OH and in situ O2, respectively, and then O2 molecules adsorbed at Fe active sites obviously lower the energy barrier for ·OH formation. Meanwhile, its glutathione-oxidase-like activity can rapidly consume glutathione (GSH) in the TME to induce tumor cell apoptosis and ferroptosis. Density functional theory calculation results elucidate the possible mechanism of ROS generation: O2 molecules are activated by receiving sonoelectrons to generate ·O2-, which further reacts with H2O to produce OH-. Then OH- is oxidized by sonoholes to form ·OH. Fe-N-C displays a superior tumor specificity SDT.",

      "abstract": "Glutathione (GSH) levels have been linked to aging and the pathogenesis of various diseases, highlighting the necessity for the development of sensitive analytical methods for GSH to facilitate disease diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we synthesized a novel core-shell material, UiO@TBTA, by in-situ growing TFPB-TAPA COF on UiO-66-NH2 through a Schiff base reaction. The resulting composite capitalize on the advantages of both materials, demonstrating excellent stability, large specific surface area, and abundant active functional groups while preserving superior crystallinity. Notably, this strategy effectively reduces the occurrence of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) in COFs. Due to the inner filter effect and hydrogen bonding interactions between UiO@TBTA and GSH, a specific ratiometric fluorescence detection of GSH was achieved in the range of 0.1-7 μM, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0685 μM. In addition, due to the sensitive color change of the sensing material from orange to black caused by GSH, a proportional colorimetric sensing strategy has also been proposed, enabling the detection of GSH within the range of 1-200 μM. What's more, two intelligent artificial neural networks models were constructed with the help of machine learning that can quickly, accurately, and sensitively determine the concentration of GSH based on fluorescence images and color photographs respectively. Our work represents the first study utilizing MOF@COF composite for the multimodal detection of GSH, thus providing a novel strategy for the multimodal detection of the target analyte. Prospectively, the construction of the fluorescence/colorimetric dual-mode intelligent ratiometric sensing platform using deep machine learning holds great promise for real-time monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis therapy employs reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated via Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. However, the antioxidant system associated with the tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibits high levels of glutathione (GSH) that significantly restrict the therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis. In this study, we propose a near-infrared (NIR)-responsive hollow mesoporous manganese dioxide (HM-MnO2) nanoprobe with multi-enzyme-like activity for enhanced ROS generation and GSH depletion that can efficiently promote ferroptosis. The ferroptosis inducer RSL3 is encapsulated within HM-MnO2 with a loading capacity of 67 %, while iron-doped dopamine (Fe-PDA) and cRGD tumor-targeting peptides are conjugated on the surface. The resultant MnO2R@FePDA-cRGD nanocomposite delivers a photothermal conversion efficiency of 39.1 % under 808 nm irradiation, which can effectively trigger structural degradation of the nanoplatform and the rapid release of RSL3. The photothermal effects significantly augment catalytic activity, enabling a multi-enzyme mimicking that includes peroxidase (POD), oxidase (OXD), GSH peroxidase (GPx), and NADH oxidase (NOx) functions, generating significant ROS radicals and an efficient depletion of intracellular GSH. These cascade reactions contribute to an optimal TME for inducing \"explosive\" ferroptosis with a synergistic inhibition of tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. The proposed strategy represents a potent approach to amplifying ferroptosis through the photothermal-driven rapid release of RSL3 and enhanced multi-enzyme mimetic activities with significant potential in nanomedicine-based cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma represents a highly aggressive form of malignant tumor within the central nervous system. Although chemotherapy remains the primary therapeutic strategy, its efficacy is often limited. To overcome the limitations associated with chemotherapeutic agents, such as high toxicity and non-specific adverse effects, a novel nanoparticle system comprising cRGD-modified and glutathione (GSH)-responsive polymers, and PEG-ss-Dox and apatinib (AP) (PDOX-AP/cRGD-NPs) is developed. PDOX-AP/cRGD-NPs show effective penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), facilitate targeted delivery to brain tumors, and exhibit controlled drug release. PDOX-AP/cRGD-NPs show more effect in reducing the viability of GL-261, U87-MG, and LN-229 cells, inhibiting clonogenicity, and suppressing anti-apoptotic protein expression than PDOX/cRGD-NPs or AP/cRGD-NPs. Additionally, PDOX-AP/cRGD-NPs substantially increase drug uptake, BBB penetration, apoptosis rates, and the proportion of cells in the G2 phase. In vivo experiments further reveal that cRGD-directed nanoparticles exhibit superior accumulation in glioma regions compared to their non-cRGD-modified counterparts. In the interim, PDOX-AP/cRGD-NPs demonstrate significant efficacy in suppressing both ectopic and orthotopic growth of GL-261 gliomas, as well as orthotopic LN-229 gliomas, thereby markedly extending the median survival duration. This study introduces a promising targeted co-delivery system for combination chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) arises from perinatal hypoxia, a leading cause of neonatal mortality during the perinatal period, as well as subsequent disabilities beyond the neonatal stage. While there is currently no unified and comprehensive treatment approach for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), hypothermia therapy represents the only recognized clinical intervention. Nevertheless, the efficacy of hypothermia therapy remains limited. Recently, atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs), an emerging class of nanomaterials, has displayed promising potential in biomedical field. This study aimed to assess whether glutathione-protected Au22 nanoclusters (GSH-Au22 NCs) could mitigate brain damage induced by hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury in rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in cortical primary neurons while exploring the underlying protective mechanisms. In vitro findings revealed that GSH-Au22 NCs enhanced cell activity, mitigated inflammatory reactions, and reduced oxidative stress induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation in cortical primary neurons. In vivo, GSH-Au22 NCs significantly diminished cerebral infarction volume, alleviated inflammatory responses, reduced oxidative stress, facilitated tissue structure recovery, attenuated apoptosis resulting from HIE, and enhanced long-term learning and memory abilities following HI injury. Mechanistically, GSH-Au22 NCs ameliorated the Sirt3/SOD2 signaling pathway, thereby exerting a protective effect against HIBD. Furthermore, the protective impact of GSH-Au22 NCs was reversed upon knocking down SOD2. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that GSH-Au22 NCs modulate the Sirt3/SOD2 signaling pathway, thereby mitigating HI brain damage."

Oxidative stress is induced during infection by both HIV and hCoVs and contributes to disease severity. The study aims to determine the oxidative stress marker, malondialdehyde (MDA), and antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), levels among PLWH co-infected with human coronaviruses (HIV+/hCoVs+) in Ghana. This is a prospective cross-sectional study that recruited 300 PLWH at three hospitals in Ghana. RNA extraction and PCR were carried out on naso- and oro-pharyngeal swabs taken from three groups of participants: HIV+/hCoVs+, HIV ART-experienced individuals who tested negative for hCoVs (HIV+/hCoVs-), and HIV-negative individuals who tested negative for hCoVS (HIV-/hCoVs-). MDA and GSH levels were determined in the participants using plasma samples. MDA levels of HIV+/hCoVs+ were significantly higher than that of HIV+/hCoVs- and HIV-/hCoVs- p < 0.0001. Reduced GSH levels among the HIV+/hCoVs+ was significantly lower than that of HIV+/hCoVs-, but significantly higher than that of HIV-/hCoVs-. Age group 51+ years showed an increased MDA levels among the HIV+/hCoVs+ group compared to the mono-infected and control group. Among the co-infected HIV+/hCoVs+ group, Abacavir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir (A + L + D) usage had significantly higher MDA levels than those on Tenoforvir-disoproxil + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir, and there was an association between MDA and GSH levels among those on ART for 1-2 years compared to > 5 years. The study underscores the significant influence of HIV co-infection with human coronaviruses on oxidative stress, emphasizing the need for tailored monitoring and treatment strategies for Ghanaian patients.",

      "abstract": "Pomacea canaliculata is one of the most destructive threats to the safe production of rice. Molluscicides are the primary measure for controlling this pest species. Tea saponin (TS) is a plant secondary metabolite with a high snail-killing activity. However, some individuals have enhanced detoxification metabolism against TS, leading to a weakened control efficiency of TS to P. canaliculata. To clarify the detoxification and metabolic mechanisms of TS in P. canaliculata, we characterized the toxicity of TS against the snails. Additionally, we examined its biochemical and molecular effects on glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities, as well as their corresponding gene expression levels. The results showed that the LC50 values were 6.12, 9.03, and 9.35 mg/L for small, medium, and large snails following 24 h exposure. The LT50 values were 16.85, 20.96, and 29.85 h for small, medium, and large snails at a concentration of 9 mg/L exposure, respectively. Furthermore, as the TS concentration increased or the treatment duration was prolonged, the activities of GSTs and MAO increased, along with the corresponding gene expression levels of PcGSTs1, PcGSTo1, PcmGST1 and PcMAO, compared to those of untreated snails. These results indicated that TS displayed dose- and time-dependent toxicity to P. canaliculata. Overall, the biochemical and molecular results suggested that GSTs and MAO were probably involved in the detoxification metabolism of P. canaliculata against TS. These findings preliminarily clarified the detoxification mechanism of P. canaliculata against TS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia are complex and not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate changes to total glutathione (T-GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), reduced glutathione (GSH), and the GSH/GSSG ratio before and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients with acute relapse of schizophrenia and associations with clinical symptoms. METHODS: The study cohort included 110 patients with acute relapse of schizophrenia and 55 healthy controls. All patients received 8-10 sessions of ECT. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). RESULTS: As compared to the healthy controls, schizophrenia patients had decreased baseline GSSG levels (t = -2.115, p = 0.036) and elevated GSH/GSSG ratios (t = 2.141, p = 0.034). Baseline GSSG levels were negatively correlated with both PANSS total scores (beta = -0.369, t = -4.108, p < 0.001) and positive symptom scores (beta = -0.332, t = -3.730, p < 0.001), while changes to GSSG levels were positively correlated with improvements in PANSS total scores (r = 0.392, p < 0.001) and positive symptom scores (r = 0.293, p = 0.005) after ECT treatment. In treatment responders, GSSG levels were significantly increased (t = -2.817, p = 0.006) and GSH/GSSG ratios were decreased (t = 4.474, p < 0.001), as compared to before ECT, with baseline T-GSH (B = 0.734, OR = 2.083, 95%CI:1.287-3.372, p = 0.003), GSSG (B = -2.720, OR = 0.066, 95%CI:0.011-0.390, p = 0.003), and GSH/GSSG ratio (B = -1.013, OR = 0.363, 95%CI:0.142-0.930, p = 0.035) predictive of clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Patients with schizophrenia exhibit significant redox imbalance, and GSSG levels may serve as a potential biomarker to evaluate and predict ECT outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) pollution poses a growing threat to plant growth. Although glutathione (GSH) is recognized for its potential to mitigate Cd-induced stress, its specific effects on alleviating such stress in Pogostemon cablin (patchouli) remain unclear. This study investigated physiological parameters and enzymatic activities across four treatment groups: control (CK), cadmium stress (Cd), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione with cadmium stress (GSH+Cd). Results revealed that chlorophyll a, b, and carotenoid levels in the GSH were approximately 20 % higher than those in the other groups. In contrast, antioxidant enzyme activity in the Cd decreased by about 15 %. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses demonstrated that GSH mitigates Cd stress by influencing glycerophospholipid metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis, with key roles attributed to dgkA1, dgkA2, and CCoAOMT1-4. In conclusion, GSH alleviates Cd stress in P. cablin by enhancing photosynthetic pigment synthesis, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) through improved enzymatic activity, and regulating metabolic pathways. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the cultivation and management of P. cablin under Cd stress conditions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The frequency of recurrent pregnancy loss in society is 3-5%. Experts suggest that genetics account for over 80% of unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes, regulated by GST genes, facilitate the detoxification of a variety of naturally occurring metabolites as well as environmentally derived chemicals. This research aimed to investigate GST gene polymorphisms as a potential risk factor in recurrent pregnancy loss etiology in the Turkish population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved 107 recurrent pregnancy loss patients who sought treatment at the Sivas Cumhuriyet University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, along with a control group of 107 individuals who had a successful birth and no previous history of miscarriage. The multiplex polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques were employed to analyze GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 gene polymorphisms in these cases. RESULTS: GSTT1 null genotype (X2=4.74; p=0.029) and GSTT1/GSM1 null genotype (X2=3.333; p=0.047) were associated with statistically significant differences between the study groups. No statistical significance was detected when considering the GSTM1 null genotype (X2=3.326; p=0.068) or the GSTM1/GSTP1 and GSTT1/GSTP1 gene polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: A statistically significant association was observed between the GSTT1 null genotype and the diseased group. Our research demonstrated a substantial increase in the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss in the Turkish population, specifically among individuals with the GSTM1-null genotype. No statistical correlation was found between the GSTM1 and GSTP1 gene polymorphisms and recurrent pregnancy loss. Furthermore, no statistical significance was observed when they were assessed together."

      "abstract": "Reduced glutathione (GSH) could reduce oxidative stress to improve adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) engraftment efficiency in vivo. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our goal is to investigate whether GSH enhances ADSC engraftment through targeting the TGFβ/SMAD3/NOX4 pathway. Liver fibrotic male mice were administrated GSH, setanaxib (STX), and SIS3 during ADSC transplantation. ADSC engraftment efficiency and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were detected both in vivo and ex vivo. Biochemical analysis was used to analyze the content of superoxide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NOXs) in liver tissues. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to examine the protein level of NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1), SMAD3, and p-SMAD3 in liver tissues. Additionally, the therapeutic efficacy of the ADSC transplantation was further investigated. We found that GSH significantly improved ADSC engraftment efficiency, which was closely related to the reduced ROS generation in liver tissues. However, the enhanced cell engraftment was abolished after the combined treatment with STX or SIS3. GSH could effectively reduce superoxide and NOXs content, and selectively inhibit NOX4 expression in liver tissues. The co-localization results showed that GSH could reduce NOX4 expressed in activated hepatic stellate cells. Mechanistically, GSH down-regulated TGFβ/SMAD3 signaling. More importantly, GSH enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of ADSC therapy in liver fibrotic mice. Taken together, GSH could improve the engraftment efficiency of ADSCs in liver fibrosis by targeting TGFβ1/SMAD3/NOX4 signaling pathway, which provides a new theoretical basis for GSH enhancing ADSC engraftment efficiency in liver diseases."

      "abstract": "Nanozymes with biological enzyme activity show great promise in biochemical analysis and medicine, yet single-activity nanozymes were limited by low catalytic efficiency and strict catalytic environment requirements. Consequently, the development of nanozymes with multiple enzyme activities presents a significant challenge. In the work, a vanadium-capped polyoxometalates (POMs)-encapsulating metal-organic framework (MOF), [Cu12(Trz)8Cl][PMo12O40(VO)2], was synthesized via hydrothermal synthesis, which shows multiple enzyme activities concluding oxidase (OXD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities. In the catalytic procedure, a fraction of H2O2 generated by the OXD is further subjected to the POD catalytic reaction and the remaining portion is transformed into O2 through the CAT activity, in turn, supplies the driving force for the OXD-like catalytic process. This cascade reaction, in conjunction with the transformation between Cu2+ and Cu+ within the material, engenders a structure analogous to an interlocking \"gear\", which augments the catalytic efficacy as well as the adaptability to intricate environmental conditions of the [Cu12(Trz)8Cl][PMo12O40(VO)2] enzyme. By capitalizing on this high catalytic efficiency, the rapid quantitative detection of glutathione (GSH) was established with the calculated limit of detection (LOD) 0.062 μM in the range of 5-60 μM. Surprisingly, the multi-enzymatic [Cu12(Trz)8Cl][PMo12O40(VO)2] can concurrently enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the depletion of GSH in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby inducing tumor cell apoptosis. This research holds promising application prospects in the fields of biotechnology, clinical diagnosis, and tumor therapy.",

Resistance to oxidative toxicity is an important factor for pathogens. Glutathione synthesis contributes to reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification in bacterial cells. Little is known about the roles of glutathione synthesis and transport in S. suis. In this study, we demonstrated that glutathione treatment increased oxidative stress tolerance in S. suis. GshAB and GshT were found in S. suis glutathione synthesis and import by bioinformatics. In vitro, inactivation of gshAB and gshT led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Inactivation of gshT led to growth defects in the medium. The intracellular glutathione content of gshAB or gshT deletion mutants was lower than that of wild type (WT) strain. The phagocytic resistance of gshAB and gshT mutants was lower than that of the WT strain. Moreover, the virulence of gshAB and gshT deletion mutants was significantly lower than that of the WT strain in mouse survival and tissue loading experiments. In conclusion, these results revealed the functions of GshAB and GshT in the pathogenesis of S. suis. These findings enhance our understanding of bacterial virulence mechanisms and may provide a new avenue for therapeutic intervention aimed at curbing S. suis infections.",

However, the systematical evaluation of oxidative damage on plants induced by cyantraniliprole and broflanilide still remains elusive. In this study, the toxic effects were investigated in the biochemical and physiological aspects using AtGSTF8 as a biomarker. First, cyantraniliprole not only brought about much more detrimental impacts on the growth status of plant seedlings but also resulted in a significant upregulation of AtGSTF8 gene expression compared to broflanilide. Then, the glutathione S-transferase activities of AtGSTF8 decreased greatly with treatment of these two diamide insecticides. Moreover, biolayer interferometry analysis confirmed the interactions of both cyantraniliprole and broflanilide with AtGSTF8, especially for cyantraniliprole with stronger binding affinity, which conformed to the molecular docking results. At last, even more adverse effects on the structural conformations of AtGSTF8 upon binding with cyantraniliprole were observed.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of chlorophyllin and its combined administration with the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel on metastatic processes. For this purpose, both the 4T1 triple-negative breast cancer cell line and metastatic animal model were used. The MTT, flow cytometry, and wound healing assays were used to investigate cell viability, cell cycle, and cell migration, respectively. Total gelatinase activity, GST activity, and glutathione levels in cell and liver tissue lysates measured by colorimetric methods. Micrometastases were evaluated histochemically in liver tissue sections. As a result, the coadministration of chlorophyllin and docetaxel significantly inhibited cell migration in vitro. There was a significant decrease in the total gelatinase activity in vivo. We found that only combined treatment reduced the micrometastatic lesions in the liver tissues, though this reduction was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the coadministration of chlorophyllin and docetaxel may have a potential role in controlling metastatic processes by suppressing cell migration, gelatinase activity, and micrometastasis formation in triple-negative breast cancers."

      "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy has established itself as a clinical treatment for certain superficial cancers by converting oxygen into cytotoxic singlet oxygen to eradicate cancer cells. Porphyrin-based nanoscale metal-organic frameworks have emerged as promising photosensitive platforms due to their ability to prevent the hydrophobic aggregation quenching of porphyrin molecules and enhance accumulation at the tumor site, thereby becoming a focal point in photodynamic materials research. However, the elevated levels of glutathione and other reductive substances within cancer cells can alleviate the oxidative stress induced by singlet oxygen from the photodynamic therapy process, thus protecting intracellular biomolecular structures from damage. Consequently, it is crucial to design functionalized nanoplatforms that integrate glutathione depletion with porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks to significantly boost photodynamic therapy efficacy. Moreover, the excess glutathione within cells can disrupt the structure of porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks, which not only increases the capacity of porphyrin molecules to generate singlet oxygen upon light exposure but also aids in the recovery of their fluorescence imaging capabilities. Additionally, this specificity minimizes the photosensitizing harm of porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks to other normal tissues. This review compiles recent advancements in developing porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks for enhanced phototherapy through glutathione depletion. It aims to promote the further application of porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks in phototherapy and provide valuable insights for preclinical applications. By highlighting strategies that improve therapeutic outcomes while maintaining safety profiles, this summary seeks to advance the development of more effective and targeted cancer treatments."

This study aims to evaluate the effects of rumen-protected glutathione (RPGSH) supplementation on lactation, nutrient metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and health in transition dairy cows. Forty Holstein dairy cows (2.65 ± 0.78 of parity, 2.81 ± 0.24 of body condition score, 9207.56 ± 1139.18 kg of previous 305-day milk yield, 657.53 ± 55.52 kg of body weight, mean ± SD) were selected from a large cohort of 3215 cows on day 21 before expected calving (day -21 ± 3 d). Cows were randomly stratified into four dietary treatment groups (n = 10 per group): control (basal diet + 0 g/d RPGSH); T1 (basal diet + 1.5 g/d RPGSH); T2 (basal diet + 2 g/d RPGSH); and T3 (basal diet + 3 g/d RPGSH). Supplementation commenced approximately 21 days (±3) prepartum and continued through 21 days postpartum. Blood samples were collected at -21 ± 3, -14 ± 3, -7 ± 3, 0, 7, 14, and 21 d for analysis of serum metabolic parameters related to oxidative stress and inflammation. Milk composition was analyzed from samples collected on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 postpartum. Compared with the control group, supplementation with 2 g/d of RPGSH reduced somatic cell count (p < 0.05) and the incidence of postpartum diseases in dairy cows. No differences were observed among the groups in milk yield, milk fat, protein, lactose, total solids, dry matter intake, or energy-corrected milk. However, fat-corrected milk and feed efficiency were higher in the T2 group compared to the control (p < 0.05). Calcium and phosphorus levels did not differ among the groups. Compared to the control group, cows supplemented with 2 g/d RPGSH had lower β-hydroxybutyrate levels and higher glucose levels on days 14 and 21 postpartum (p < 0.05). From days 14 to 21 postpartum, RPGSH supplementation increased blood GSH, serum catalase, and total antioxidant capacity while reducing malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species, haptoglobin, cortisol, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 levels compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The supplementation of 2 g/d RPGSH showed relatively better effects. RPGSH supplementation at 2 g/d improved lactation performance, nutrient metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation status in dairy cows, playing a crucial role in maintaining their health. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effects of supplementing RPGSH additive in Holstein cows."

Acne vulgaris is recognized as the most common dermatological condition affecting adolescents, and if left untreated, it can result in lasting skin damage and associated psychosocial challenges. This study aims to develop innovative polymeric biomaterials that could effectively support the treatment of acne vulgaris. The synthesis of these biomaterials involves the use of polyethylene glycol 6000, sodium alginate, and the antioxidant protein glutathione (GHS) to create polymeric hydrogels. These hydrogels were generated via a UV-mediated crosslinking process. To enhance the functional properties of the hydrogels, zinc oxide microparticles (ZnO), synthesized through a wet precipitation method, were incorporated into the formulations. Characterization of the ZnO was performed using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), particle sizer analysis, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Additionally, the bioactivity of the synthesized materials was evaluated through incubation in media simulating physiological body fluids. The cytotoxic effects of the biomaterials were assessed using an indirect test on mouse fibroblast (L929) cells, in accordance with ISO 10993-5 guidelines. The results of our research indicate that the developed biomaterials exhibit potential as a carrier for active substances, contributing positively to the treatment of acne vulgaris and potentially improving overall skin health.",

      "abstract": "Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) accounts for approximately 17% of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infections globally. Immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV infection or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are at an increased risk for EPTB. Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with HIV and T2DM exhibit diminished synthesis of glutathione (GSH) synthesizing enzymes. In a murine model, we showed that the diethyl maleate (DEM)-induced depletion of GSH in the lungs led to increased M.tb burden and an impaired pulmonary granulomatous response to M.tb infection. However, the effects of GSH depletion during active EPTB in the liver and spleen have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we evaluated hepatic GSH and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as cytokine profiles, in untreated and DEM-treated M.tb-infected wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, we assessed hepatic and splenic M.tb burdens and tissue pathologies. DEM treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of the reduced form of GSH and an increase in MDA, oxidized GSH, and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. Furthermore, DEM-induced GSH decrease was associated with decreased production of IL-12 and IL-17 and elevated production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. A significant increase in M.tb growth was detected in the liver and spleen in DEM-treated M.tb-infected mice. Large, disorganized lymphocyte infiltrates were detected in the hepatic tissues of DEM-treated mice. Overall, GSH diminishment impaired the granulomatous response to M.tb in the liver and exacerbated M.tb growth in both the liver and spleen. These findings provide critical insights into the immunomodulatory role of GSH in TB pathogenesis and suggest potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of extrapulmonary M.tb infections."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which tends to be more advanced when diagnosed and more aggressive than other breast cancer subtypes, is accelerated by obesity. Hypertrophic adipocytes and cancer cells exhibit increased oxidative stress and altered redox homeostasis, influencing therapeutic outcomes. Enzymes implicated in both redox regulation and TNBC include glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4; reduces lipid peroxides) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC; essential in oxidative stress protection). Using preclinical models, we characterized interactions between GPX4, PC, and oxidative stress in TNBC cells, and established effects of GPX4 suppression on TNBC progression. In TNBC cells, PC knockdown increased GPX4 expression, while GPX4 knockdown increased PC expression. GPX4 inhibition by erastin or RSL3 enhanced TNBC cell death in vitro, and antioxidants mitigated the cytotoxicity. In obese mice, GPX4 knockdown, versus scramble control: (i) reduced tumor burden following orthotopic transplantation of TNBC cells; and (ii) reduced lung metastasis following tail vein injection of TNBC cells in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin) but not immunotherapy (anti-CTLA4 plus anti-PD1). We conclude that GPX4 and PC expression are inversely related in TNBC cells, and GPX4 and obesity interact to impact TNBC progression and treatment responses. Moreover, GPX4-mediated redox defense, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, is a targetable vulnerability for treating TNBC, including obesity-related TNBC. IMPLICATION: GPX4 suppression, alone or with current TNBC therapies, impacts outcomes in preclinical TNBC models with or without obesity and offers a new, plausible mechanistic target for TNBC treatment."

      "abstract": "Senescent chondrocytes, which are increased in osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage, promote cartilage defects and the senescent knee microenvironment by inducing senescence to surrounding normal chondrocytes by secreting senescence-associated secretory proteins. Many studies have used mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat OA, but MSC treatment remains challenging for clinical application owing to MSC quality control, engraftment, and fibrocartilage regeneration. Here, rather than relying on the direct regeneration of MSCs, we present a novel strategy to suppress OA by MSC-mediated senescent chondrocyte targeting via the paracrine activity of MSCs, thereby improving the knee microenvironment. First, to enable quality control of umbilical cord MSCs, priming MSCs by supplementing human platelet lysate (hPL) greatly enhanced MSC functions by increasing cellular glutathione levels throughout serial passaging. Intra-articular injection of primed MSCs successfully suppressed OA progression and senescent chondrocyte accumulation without direct regeneration. Indirect coculture with primed MSCs using transwell ameliorated the senescence phenotypes in OA chondrocytes, suggesting paracrine rejuvenation. Based on secretome analysis, we identified insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) as a key component that induces paracrine rejuvenation by primed MSCs. The rejuvenation effects of IGF2 act through autophagy activation through the up-regulation of autophagy-related gene expression and autophagic flux. To cross-validate the effects of secreted IGF2 in vivo, knockdown of IGF2 in primed MSCs substantially abolished its therapeutic efficacy in a rabbit OA model. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that hPL supplementation enables MSC quality control by increasing MSC glutathione levels. The therapeutic mechanism of primed MSCs was secreted IGF2, which induces paracrine rejuvenation of senescent OA chondrocytes by activating autophagy."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic overuse has caused the development of bacterial resistance, which is a major threat to public health. Intracellular metabolic processes are essential for maintaining the normal physiological activities of bacteria, and an increasing body of research has demonstrated a significant association between metabolic alterations and the development of drug resistance. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the addition of adjuvants can counteract bacterial antibiotic resistance. METHOD: Cystine treatment was verified in vitro to promote the lethal effect of gentamicin on Salmonella using in vitro bactericidal counting methods. The metabolic differences in Salmonella enterica Typhimurium standard strain ATCC 14028 with or without the addition of cystine were analyzed via untargeted metabolomics. The multifunctional electronic enzyme marker was used to determine intracellular reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), ferrous iron on (Fe2+), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The expression of glutathione and stress genes was determined using real-time quantitative PCR. RESULT: We confirmed that exogenous cystine increased the lethal effect of gentamicin against strain S. enterica Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) and other clinically resistant Salmonella serotypes. Exogenous cystine stimulated the metabolism of the cell and activated the glutathione pathway while altering the GSH/GSSG ratio, which placed bacteria in a state of redox imbalance with increased Fe2+ and ROS levels. Our results suggest that when bacterial redox levels are reprogrammed, bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics can also change. DISCUSSION: This study confirms that cystine enhances the antimicrobial efficacy of gentamicin against drug-resistant Salmonella. Through the application of metabolomics, the underlying metabolic mechanisms by which cystine exerts its effects on Salmonella have been elucidated, offering a novel perspective in the domain of metabolic reprogramming aimed at counteracting drug resistance. Furthermore, these findings reinforce the potential role of small-molecule metabolites as effective adjuvants to enhance antibiotic action."

      "abstract": "Lentil is an essential edible legume crop, especially for developing countries, due to the presence of high-quality proteins, fibers, essential vitamins, and mineral nutrients. The short height of this crop is often linked with a slow pace of growth, favoring the suitable space and time for weed incursion. Consequently, the developmental period during the crop growth cycle is shortened, leading to a decline in crop productivity. To control the menace of weeds and sustain the yield potential of lentils, we have evaluated the impact of imazethapyr spray on the osmotic behavior of lentil crops. Further, we have investigated the kinetics of PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and GST (glutathione-s-transferase) to elucidate the process of imazethapyr detoxification by lentil crop at the seedling stage. The results of the present study demonstrated that imazethapyr spray reduced the RWC (relative water content) in the range of 3.10-40.48% across the applied doses of 0.5 RFD (recommended field dose), 1 RFD, 1.25 RFD, 1.5 RFD, and 2 RFD, during different sampling periods from 0 HBT (hours before treatment) to 120 HAT (hours after treatment). On the other hand, proline content increased across different doses of imazethapyr and sampling hours. Proline content was highest at 2 RFD and varied in the 112.12-309.49% range during different sampling hours. Similarly, total soluble sugar content increased (18.15-151.66%) in response to varying imazethapyr doses across different sampling hours. The kinetic study of PAL and GST indicated progressive increases in the Vmax (maximum velocity) and Km (Michelis-Menten constant) of both enzymes. Vmax of PAL varied from 1.09-2.31 μmol of t-cinnamic acid produced (h-1 mg-1 protein), whereas that of GST varied from 35.59-83.33 μmol of CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) across the imazethapyr doses.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Choroid plexuses regulate the exchanges between the blood and the CSF, and provide trophic factors necessary to brain development. They also express detoxifying enzymes that protect the developing brain from harmful substances. Targeting the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway may enhance the detoxification capabilities of choroid plexuses that are linked to glutathione conjugation, but little is known about mechanisms of enzyme induction in this tissue. METHODS: Rat pups were treated with dimethylfumarate and the subcellular localization of Nrf2 was analyzed in the choroidal tissue by confocal imaging. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was assessed ex vivo in the choroidal tissue, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, a toxicant and prototypic GST substrate, was used to evaluate in vivo the efficiency of the glutathione-dependent enzymatic barrier function of choroid plexuses. Nrf2 knockout rat pups were used to establish the Nrf2 dependency of GST induction in this tissue. RESULTS: We show an early postnatal expression of Nrf2 in the rat choroidal tissue. Treatment of rat pups with dimethylfumarate triggers Nrf2 nuclear translocation in choroidal epithelial cells. This treatment increases GST activity in choroid plexus, and reduces the blood-to-CSF permeation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. In Nrf2 knockout rats, the constitutive activity of the choroidal glutathione-dependent detoxifying machinery is maintained, but the efficacy of dimethylfumarate to induce glutathione conjugation in the choroid plexuses is strongly reduced, indicating that dimethylfumarate acts mainly through the Nrf2 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that the glutathione-dependent detoxifying function of the blood-CSF barrier can be pharmacologically enhanced through the Nrf2 signaling pathway to better protect the neural fluid environment from drug and toxic accumulation during the neonatal period.",

      "abstract": "Mutp53 level is widely variable among individual cancer cells in tumor tissues, and within cells a higher level of mutp53 is usually observed in the nucleus as compared to the cytoplasm. This spatial heterogeneity in mutp53 expression has been well documented and likely plays an important role in tumor therapeutic resistance. However, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we first revealed a critical role of micro-environmental reducing status in regulating mutp53 stability and spatially heterogeneous accumulation. Immunofluorescence and ThiolTracker Violet dye staining demonstrated a clear correlation between the cellular mutp53 level and the reducibility in the patient-derived tumor tissues and mutp53-expressing cancer cell lines. The nucleus exhibited both higher reducibility and more mutp53 accumulation than the cytoplasm did. Supplementing GSH exacerbated the accumulation of mutp53, while consuming GSH led to extensive depletion of mutp53, suggesting that the environmental reducing status kept mutp53 stability. Mechanistically, S-glutathionylation could trigger ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of mutp53. A highly-reducing local environment preserved mutp53 stability by inhibiting glutathionylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of mutp53, which also provided an explanation for the differential accumulation of mutp53 proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Thirdly, we revealed that the expression level of glutathione reductase (GR) was positively correlated with mutp53 accumulation across the cultured mutp53-expressing cell lines, patient-derived tumor tissues and patient databases. Over-expression of GR reinforced the environmental reducibility, affected glutathionylation and improved mutp53 accumulation, while inhibiting GR either by chemical inhibitors or genetic approach induced massive clearance of a variety of mutp53 and effectively retarded the growth of p53-mutated cell-derived xenografts in mice. These studies provided an explanation for the widely-observed spatial heterogeneous accumulation of mutp53 proteins, and inhibiting GR or directly consuming GSH represented a promising strategy for mutp53 carrying cancer therapy.",

However, high glutathione (GSH) level within tumor cells severely impacts the efficacy of CDT. Therefore, reducing intracellular GSH levels has become an approach to enhance CDT. Here, we propose a HDAC inhibiting nanoprodrug consisting of an amphiphilic reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polyprodrug and a GSH-responsive dimer. The high ROS level in tumor tissues can trigger the release of cinnamaldehyde and ferrocene to upregulate intracellular ROS levels through generation of hydroxyl radicals. Additionally, the dimer can react with intracellular GSH to release histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for inhibiting HDAC, thereby suppressing GSH synthesis by reducing precursor supply. The multistage depletion of GSH can further enhance oxidative damage of hydroxyl radicals to cancer cells. This study provides a promising HDAC-inhibiting strategy to achieve GSH depletion for enhanced CDT.",

One proposed biologic mechanism underlying ASD is oxidative stress, leading to the clinical use of glutathione based on anecdotal reports of improved behavior in autistic children. In this pilot study, we tested this observation using a randomized clinical trial format to collect preliminary data on glutathione safety and efficacy. METHODS: Glutathione and glutathione in combination with vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine (Trio) were tested. Both treatments were administered in double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover studies. In total, 24 children between the ages of 5 and 16 years with ASD and severe behavior disorders were randomized to receive weekly intravenous injections of either placebo or 1 of the 2 interventions (glutathione or Trio) for 8 weeks. After a 1-week washout period, participants were crossed over for the subsequent 8 weeks. Behavioral measures and plasma levels of glutathione were obtained at baseline, during the washout period, and at the end of the study. RESULTS: No differences between treatment groups in behavioral or biologic measures were found. No significant adverse side effects attributable to the treatments were observed. Small improvements in specific glutathione and behavioral measures occurred over the study period for all groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment with glutathione or glutathione in combination with vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine did not result in improvements in behavior or biologic measures. The positive trends over the course of the study were likely due to the placebo effect or decreased anxiety associated with the study routine.",

Current treatment options include standard surgical resection combined with radiation/chemotherapy, but such protocol most likely only delays the inevitable.

It is known that the functions of selenoproteins in the regulation of carcinogenesis processes are not unambiguous. Either they exhibit cytotoxic activity on cancer cells, or cytoprotective. A special place in the progression of oncological diseases of various etiologies is occupied by proteins of the thioredoxin and glutathione systems. These are two cellular antioxidant systems that regulate redox homeostasis, counteracting the increased production of reactive oxygen species in cells. The review reflects the latest data on the role of key enzymes of these redox systems in the regulation of processes associated with the progression of glioblastoma.

The relative amount of antibiotic-induced oxidative stress to oxidative stress-scavenging systems may determine the roles of antibiotic-induced oxidative stress in cellular death. Glutathione is one of the oxidative-scavenging systems and is synthesized by glutamyl-cysteine synthetase encoded by gshA and glutathione synthetase encoded by gshB. This study aims to determine the roles of glutathione in oxidative stress and antibiotic susceptibility in P. aeruginosa. Glutathione-encoding genes were knocked out in P. aeruginosa PAO1, and the mutant strains (gshA::Gm, gshB::Gm, and gshA::Gm/gshB::Tc) were used to determine susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide, superoxide-producing paraquat, and antibiotics. The mutant strains were 2- to eightfold more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide and 2- to fourfold more susceptible to all tested antibiotics than their parental strain. The susceptibility of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and antibiotics was genetically complemented in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Overall results indicate that glutathione is crucial in detoxifying oxidative stress induced internally and by antibiotics in P. aeruginosa. This finding suggests that glutathione is one of the oxidative stress-scavenging systems and one of the intrinsic resistance mechanisms to antibiotics and, thus, a potential drug target for P. aeruginosa.",

      "abstract": "The combination of doxorubicin (Dox) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) has been widely explored for treating various cancers, while the heterogeneous distribution, uncontrolled release and acid tumor microenvironment often hinder their synergistic effects. Herein, we introduce an acid/glutathione (GSH)-dual responsive nano-prodrug (AS1411@Dox+GA/NPs) enabling precise co-delivery of Dox and GA for enhanced combination therapy. The GSH-activated Dox prodrug [Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-disulfide-Dox, PLGA-ss-Dox], GA, and sulfur-terminated D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS-SH) are combined to form a nanoemulsion with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in the aqueous phase. The AS1411 aptamer is modified on the surface for tumor-specific targeting. Upon reaching the tumor via enhanced penetration and retention effects, AS1411 aptamer medicates specific endocytosis of AS1411@Dox+GA/NPs into tumor cells. Intracellularly, the acidic endosomal environment promotes carbon dioxide (CO2) production from NaHCO3, disrupting the nanoemulsion and causing a burst release of GA and PLGA-ss-Dox prodrug. Concurrently, high levels of GSH in the cytoplasm triggers the cleavage of the disulfide linker, thereby releasing Dox. Notably, the released NaHCO3 consumed hydrogen ion (H+), amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to Dox. As a consequence, AS1411@Dox+GA/NPs exhibits remarkable synergistic therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of both liver cancer and breast cancer. This work presents an appealing approach utilizing stimuli-sensitive nano-prodrug for advanced combinational cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Fatty liver is a major metabolic disorder in perinatal dairy cows, characterized by elevated plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and hepatic inflammation. Glutathione S-transferase mu 2 (GSTM2), a phase II detoxification enzyme, regulates cellular antioxidant and detoxification processes in nonruminants. However, its involvement in NEFA-induced hepatic inflammation in dairy cows with fatty liver remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of GSTM2 in mediating hepatic inflammation caused by elevated NEFA levels in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. An in vivo study was conducted using 10 healthy cows (hepatic triacylglycerol [TG] content <1%) and 10 cows with severe fatty liver (hepatic TG content >10%), matched for the number of lactations (median = 3, range = 2-4) and DIM (median = 9 d, range = 3-15 d). Liver tissue and blood samples were collected before feeding. Compared with healthy cows, cows with severe fatty liver had higher plasma concentrations of NEFA, BHB, haptoglobin (HP), plasma amyloid A (SAA), and lower plasma concentration of glucose. These cows also showed significantly lower abundance of hepatic GSTM2 and overactivated hepatic inflammatory pathways, as indicated by increased abundance of phosphorylated inhibitor of κB (IκB)α and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), and caspase-1 (CASP1), as well as mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFA), IL6, and IL1B. In vitro, hepatocytes isolated from 5 healthy calves (1 d old, fasted female, 30-40 kg of BW) were used to determine the effects of GSTM2 on hepatic inflammation. First, hepatocytes were treated with NEFA (1.2 mM) for varying durations (0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18 h). The NEFA treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB p65, protein abundance of NLRP3, ASC and CASP1, and mRNA levels of TNFA, IL6 and IL1B, peaking at 9 and 12 h. Second, hepatocytes were treated with different concentrations of NEFA (0, 0.6, 1.2, or 2.4 mM) for 9 h, which decreased GSTM2 protein and mRNA abundance. Meanwhile, GSTM2 was silenced using small interfering RNA or overexpressed using adenovirus for 48 h in hepatocytes, followed by NEFA treatment. Silencing GSTM2 augmented the NEFA-induced increase in phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB p65, as well as protein abundance of NLRP3, ASC and CASP1, and mRNA levels of TNFA, IL6 and IL1B. Conversely, overexpression of GSTM2 mitigated these inflammatory signals upon NEFA treatment. In summary, these findings indicate that GSTM2 plays a crucial role in modulating NEFA-induced hepatic inflammation. Targeting GSTM2 may offer new strategies to treat or prevent fatty liver disease in dairy cows.",

However, there remains room to further improve AuNRs for the imaging and treatment of tumors. We developed a biomarker responsive AuNR-based Janus nanoprobe by integrating MnO2 on one end of the AuNRs and specific ligands on the other end. In the tumor microenvironment, highly expressed transglutaminase (TGase), which facilitates the formation of isopeptide linkages between glutamine (Gln) and lysine (Lys), induces the aggregation of AuNRs. This in-situ aggregation amplifies the PA signal, extends the time window for PA imaging and enhances the radiosensitization effect. Meanwhile, the highly expressed glutathione (GSH) in tumors degrades MnO2 which triggers a chemodynamic treatment.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Itaconate (IA) is synthesized in the citric acid cycle via cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1); however, its biological significance in cancer remains incompletely understood. In previous studies, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) was used as a membrane-permeable form of IA, but little detailed verification of the difference in biological activities between IA and OI exists. Here, we investigated the direct effects of IA and OI on melanoma. Results: The proliferation of melanoma cells treated with OI was significantly suppressed in vitro, and our transcriptomic analysis revealed drastic changes in the expression of glutathione metabolism-related genes in OI-treated cells. Indeed, OI treatment decreased intracellular glutathione levels, followed by increased production of reactive oxygen species and expression of γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, and β-galactosidase, a marker of cellular senescence. We further showed that the mitochondrial respiratory capacity in B16 cells was significantly decreased by OI treatment. OI administration also suppressed the growth of B16 tumor transplants in vivo, and the expression of γH2AX was increased in tumor tissues of OI-treated mice. In addition, minimal effects of OI treatment were observed in melanocytes and normal tissues. We also proved that not only exogenous IA, which enters intracellularly, but also endogenous IA has little effect on melanoma proliferation activity, via an investigation using Acod1-overexpressing transfectants and Acod1-deficient mice. Conclusion: This work revealed that OI disrupts the antioxidant system via the collapse of glutathione metabolism and inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 42, 547-565.",

However, there are few studies on the role of lncRNAs induced by endophyte in host plants under Pb stress. Therefore, we conducted high-throughput sequencing on root tissue of endophyte-infected and -uninfected rice seedlings under Pb stress, and analyzed the target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). The results showed that endophyte infection significantly increased plant height, above-ground fresh weight and dry weight, but significantly decreased root length and under-ground dry weight after 5 d of treatment. A total of 413 DElncRNAs (167 down-regulated and 246 up-regulated) were screened. Their target differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were significantly enriched in glutathione metabolism, plasma membrane and mineral elements transfer etc. DEmRNAs were most significantly enriched in glutathione metabolism, thereinto detected total glutathione, reduced and oxidized glutathione contents, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities were significantly increased after 5 d of treatment. DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs were combined with miRNA database to construct ceRNA network. DEmRNAs in ceRNA network were mainly participated in carbohydrate metabolic process, peroxidase activity and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. This study will help to understand the molecular mechanism elicited by endophytic infection within rice seedlings under Pb stress from the perspective of lncRNA.",

There is a need for a new generation of effective anthelmintics for preventive and therapeutic purposes. Natural products, such as porphyrins, have been reported to inhibit the main detoxification enzymes in these parasites, called glutathione transferases, which help them evade immune response and drug therapy, thus making them good drug targets. Computational modelling was used to screen potential inhibitors out of 461 protoporphyrin IX-like compounds, including a potent known inhibitor called bromosulfophthalein. However, unlike traditional docking, where the stable energy-minimized structure is used, a short molecular dynamic simulation step was added to yield the most averaged protein structure conformation as the starting point of high throughput virtual screening. Here, it was shown that the starting point is crucial as the results suggested different lead compounds; for the 26-kDa japonicum GST, the top-scoring compounds were CID: 122690402 for the minimized structure and CID: 137797052 for the MD-simulated structure. Similarly, for the 28-kDa haematobium GST, the lead compounds were CID: 70415734 and CID: 69301914, respectively.

METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial. This study included 90 patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B, who were randomly divided into two groups (observation group and control group) using a random number table, with 45 patients in each group. The control group received standard entecavir treatment (0.5 mg/time, once a day, continuous treatment for 3 months), while the observation group received a combination therapy of reduced glutathione and the standard entecavir treatment. Liver function markers (ALT, TBIL, AST, ALB), fibrosis markers (HA, PC III, LN), and liver fibrosis grades were assessed pre-and post-treatment. HBV-DNA negative conversion rates were recorded at 4, 12, 24, and 48 weeks. The incidence of adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, headache, and mild gastric discomfort, was recorded and compared between the two groups during the treatment period. RESULTS: ALT decreased from 348.96 ± 31.47 U/L to 31.11 ± 9.78 U/L in the observation group and from 347.90 ± 31.40 U/L to 56.90 ± 16.32 U/L in the control group (P < 0.05). TBIL decreased from 61.78 ± 4.94 µmol/L to 18.82 ± 2.93 µmol/L in the observation group and from 61.32 ± 4.93 µmol/L to 26.70 ± 4.44 µmol/L in the control group (P < 0.05). ALB increased from 29.65 ± 0.94 g/L to 48.76 ± 4.85 g/L in the observation group and from 29.77 ± 0.90 g/L to 34.12 ± 0.84 g/L in the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group showed greater reductions in HA, PC III, and LN, and improved liver fibrosis grades (P < 0.05). HBV-DNA negative conversion rates in the observation group were 15.56%, 35.56%, 60.00%, and 68.89% at 4, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, respectively, compared to 2.22%, 6.67%, 17.78%, and 42.22% in the control group (P < 0.05). Adverse reaction rates were 8.89% in the observation group and 20.00% in the control group (P > 0.05).

      "abstract": "Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy is a heterogeneous neurological disorder leading to nerve damage and muscle weakness. Although multiple mutations associated with CMT were identified, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this pathology are still unclear, although most of the subtype of this disease involve mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the mechanism of pathology. Using patients' fibroblasts of autosomal recessive, predominantly demyelinating form of CMT-CMT4B3 subtype, we studied the effect of these mutations on mitochondrial metabolism and redox balance. We have found that CMT4B3-associated mutations decrease mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial NADH redox index suggesting an increase rate of mitochondrial respiration in these cells. However, mitochondrial dysfunction had no profound effect on the overall levels of ATP and on the energy capacity of these cells. Although the rate of reactive oxygen species production in mitochondria and cytosol in fibroblasts with CMT4B3 pathology was not significantly higher than in control, the level of GSH was significantly lower. Lower level of glutathione was most likely induced by the lower level of NADPH production, which was used for a GSH cycling, however, expression levels and activity of the major NADPH producing enzyme Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was not altered. Low level of GSH renders the fibroblast with CMT4B3 pathology more sensitive to oxidative stress and further treatment of cells with hydroperoxide increases CMT patients' fibroblast death rates compared to control. Thus, CMT4B3 pathology makes cells vulnerable to oxidative stress due to the lack of major endogenous antioxidant GSH.",

In situ generating injectable hydrogels, characterized by minimally invasive methods, encapsulating stability, and pH-responsive breakdown have emerged as viable delivery systems. Herein, we aim to explore a particular therapeutic modality involving the use of celecoxib-loaded GABA/wheat gluten‑sodium alginate (SA/WG-GABA+COX(40)) nanocarriers in enhancing apoptosis of OSCC (HSC-3 & SCC-25). Eventually, drug release profiles show that loaded COX and GABA demonstrated 96.04% and 98.1% at 7.2 pH. Interestingly, crucial experimental techniques like MTT assay, AO/EB staining, DAPI labeling for SCC-25, and HSC-3 displayed the highest cell lysis percentages of 86.5% and 93.3%. Notably, OSCC cell proliferation and migration and cell multiplications were limited with formulated WG/SA-GABA+COX(40) which was evident from In vitro ROS assay, flow cytometry, and JC-1 analysis. In vivo histology, blood serum biochemistry, and tumor examination in xenograft nude mice demonstrated that SA/WG-GABA+COX(40) mice reduced HSC-3 tumor cell proliferation. Downregulation of glutathione and activation of CCND2 signaling pathway caused HSC-3 OSCC cell death. Henceforth, present findings offer an advanced drug delivery method for targeted chemotherapy in treating OSCC.",

      "abstract": "Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a naturally occurring, low-toxicity, and hydrophilic bile acid (BA) in the human body that is converted by intestinal flora using primary BA. Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) functions to uptake extracellular cystine in exchange for glutamate, and is highly expressed in a variety of human cancers. Retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RLPS) refers to liposarcoma originating from the retroperitoneal area. Lipidomics analysis revealed that UDCA was one of the most significantly downregulated metabolites in sera of RLPS patients compared with healthy subjects. The augmentation of UDCA concentration (≥25 μg/mL) demonstrated a suppressive effect on the proliferation of liposarcoma cells. [15N2]-cystine and [13C5]-glutamine isotope tracing revealed that UDCA impairs cystine uptake and glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Mechanistically, UDCA binds to the cystine transporter SLC7A11 to inhibit cystine uptake and impair GSH de novo synthesis, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and mitochondrial oxidative damage. Furthermore, UDCA can promote the anti-cancer effects of ferroptosis inducers (Erastin, RSL3), the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) inhibitors (Nutlin 3a, RG7112), cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor (Abemaciclib), and glutaminase inhibitor (CB839). Together, UDCA functions as a cystine exchange factor that binds to SLC7A11 for antitumor activity, and SLC7A11 is not only a new transporter for BA but also a clinically applicable target for UDCA. More importantly, in combination with other antitumor chemotherapy or physiotherapy treatments, UDCA may provide effective and promising treatment strategies for RLPS or other types of tumors in a ROS-dependent manner."

      "abstract": "Acquired resistance poses a significant obstacle to the effectiveness of platinum-based treatment for cancers. As the most abundant antioxidant, glutathione (GSH) enables cancer cell survival and chemoresistance, by scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by platinum. Therapeutic strategy targeting GSH synthesis has been developed, however, failed to produce desirable effects in preventing cancer progression. Thus, uncovering mechanisms of rewired GSH metabolism may aid in the development of additional therapeutic strategies to overcome or delay resistance. Here, we identify upregulation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) GDIL (GSH Degradation Inhibiting LncRNA) in platinum resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) and ovarian cancer cells compared with parental ones. High expression of GDIL in resistant CRC is associated with poor survival and hyposensitivity to chemotherapy. We demonstrate that GDIL boosted GSH levels and enhances clearance of ROS induced by platinum. Metabolomic and metabolic flux analysis further reveals that GDIL promotes GSH accumulation by inhibiting GSH degradation. This is attributed by downregulation of CHAC1, an enzyme that specifically degrades intracellular GSH. Mechanistically, GDIL binds and re-localizes the nuclear protein XRN2 to the cytoplasm, where GDIL further serve as a scaffold for XRN2 to identify and degrade CHAC1 mRNA. Suppression of GDIL with selective antisense oligonucleotide, restored drug sensitivity in platinum resistant cell lines and delayed drug resistance in cell line- and patient-derived xenografts. Thus, lncRNA GDIL is a novel target to promote GSH degradation and augment platinum therapy.",

The in vitro assays did not reveal any genotoxic or mutagenic activity. No mortality or morbidity resulted from the acute oral toxicity study (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg). Administration of SAG over 13 weeks was well tolerated and did not result in any neurobehavioral alterations or effects on locomotor activity, ophthalmology, hematology, coagulation, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, thyroid hormones or the male reproductive system. Mild increases noted in liver, kidney and spleen weights were non-adverse and within historical control ranges, and no treatment-related gross or histopathology findings were observed in any organs. As a result, the NOAEL was determined to be 1500 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. Therefore, the results of these toxicological studies support the safe use of SAG in foods or dietary supplements.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cisplatin (CiSP)-mediated stimulation of TRPM7 may induce oxidant and apoptotic activities through the upregulation of Ca2+, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glioblastoma (DBTRG-05MG) cells, whereas inhibition of TRPM7 by the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) may reduce the observed increases in DBTRG-05MG. The aim of the study was to examine how TRPM7 activation stimulates DBTRG-05MG cell death but also how it inhibits the effects of TRPM7 antagonists (GSH and carvacrol, CRV) via altering ROS toxicity and apoptosis. METHOD: In the DBTRG-05MG, 5 groups were established: control, GSH (10 ​mM for 2 ​h), CiSP (25 ​μM for 24 ​h), CiSP ​+ ​GSH, and CiSP ​+ ​CRV (200 ​μM for 24 ​h). RESULTS: The amounts of cytosolic free Ca2+ were further increased in the CiSP group by the stimulation of TRPM7 (naltriben), even though the GSH and CRV treatments caused them to decrease in the cells. The amounts of mitochondrial membrane dysfunction, ROS, death cell, apoptosis, free zinc ion, and caspase-3, -8, and -9 in the cells were higher in the CiSP than in the control and GSH, although their amounts were lower in the CiSP ​+ ​GSH and CiSP ​+ ​CRV than in the CiSP only. The CiSP-induced decreases in cell viability and GSH concentrations were increased by GSH incubation. CONCLUSIONS: The stimulation of TRPM7 increased the anticancer action of CiSP, although its inhibition decreased the amount of CiSP-induced oxidative stress and DBTRG-05MG deaths through the treatment of GSH and CRV. TRPM7 stimulation could be considered a potential tumor killer channel through oxidative glioblastoma damage caused by CiSP.",

Chemo and antisense DNA therapies are two clinically proven and efficient treatment modalities for cancer. However, direct delivery of both chemo and antisense oligonucleotides into the cancerous cells is challenging and hence there is a high demand for the development of new strategies that permit the direct delivery of chemo and antisense therapeutic agents in a targeted fashion. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach for the direct delivery of hydrophobic chemo drug and cell impermeable antisense oligonucleotide into a cancer cell in a targeted fashion. Synthesis of an amphiphile (DNA1-CPT) consist of hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide (DNA1) via glutathione-responsive disulphide linker is reported. Self-assembly of DNA1-CPT results in the formation of GSH-responsive NPs with CPT as the hydrophobic core and DNA1 as the hydrophilic shell. Self-assembled NPs exhibits excellent cellular internalization via endocytosis pathway, and the high concentration of glutathione inside the cancer cells causes the cleavage of disulphide bond of the NPs and trigger the simultaneous release of CPT and DNA1a. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed for the NPs due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.",

Reduced glutathione levels in AD lead to increased oxidative stress, including glycation-induced pathology. Previously, we showed that the accumulation of reactive 1,2-dicarbonyls such as methylglyoxal, the major precursor of non-enzymatic glycation products, was reduced by the increased function of GSH-dependent glyoxalase-1 enzyme in the brain. In this two-pronged study, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an orally bioavailable prodrug of our lead glyoxalase substrate, pro-ψ-GSH, for the first time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. This prodrug delivers pharmacodynamically relevant brain concentrations of ψ-GSH upon oral delivery. Chronic oral dosing of pro-ψ-GSH effectively reverses the cognitive decline observed in the APP/PS1 mouse model. The prodrug successfully mirrors the robust effects of the parent drug i.e., reducing amyloid pathology, glycation stress, neuroinflammation, and the resultant neurodegeneration in these mice. We also report the first metabolomics study of such a treatment, which yields key biomarkers linked to the reversal of AD-related metabolic dysregulation. Collectively, this study establishes pro-ψ-GSH as a viable, disease-modifying therapy for AD and paves the way for further preclinical advancement of such therapeutics. Metabolomic signatures identified could prove beneficial in the development of treatment-specific clinically translatable biomarkers."

      "abstract": "Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging antitumor strategy utilizing iron-initiated Fenton reaction to destroy tumor cells by converting endogenous H2O2 into highly toxic hydroxyl radical (OH). However, the intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and deficient acid greatly reduce CDT efficacy because of OH scavenging and decreased OH production efficiency. Even worse, the various physiological barriers, especially in glioma, further put the brakes on the targeted delivery of Fenton agents. Herein, by exploring the thiol reaction potential of 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), we have constructed a tailored biomimetic nanoreactor to improve glioma CDT efficacy through synchronous GSH exhaustion and acidity elevation. The biomimetic nanoreactor was fabricated by employing DTNB to drive the nano-assembly of BSA molecules, followed by loading the carrier onto the cell surface of neutrophils via disulfide-thiol exchange. Upon sensing the inflammatory signal, the nanoreactor hijacked by neutrophils efficiently targets to the tumor site, which then dually depletes GSH by disulfide bond stabilizing the nanostructure and the following liberated Fe (III). In particular, the simultaneously released DTNB can not only consume the residual GSH, but also produce 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) promptly, resulting in accelerated Fenton reaction. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate the exhaustive and synchronous regulation of Fenton chemistry could potentially serve as a novel CDT strategy for glioma."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Azathioprine (AZA) is part of the standard treatment for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The first step in the complex bioconversion of AZA to active metabolites is mediated by glutathione transferases (GSTs). AIMS: Elucidate the association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 copy number variation (CNV), genetic variation in GSTA2, GSTP1, and inosine-triphosphate-pyrophosphatase, and the response to AZA in AIH. METHODS: Genotyping was performed in AIH patients (n = 131) on AZA, and in a Swedish background population (n = 283). Thiopurine metabolites in blood erythrocytes were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: GSTM1 and GSTT1 CNV were associated with treatment response to AZA. Gene deletion of GSTM1-but not of GSTT1-was associated with the liver transaminase levels. None of the studied genetic variants were associated with the thiopurine metabolite concentrations, suggesting non-enzymatic mechanisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in the context of AZA efficacy in AIH. The prevalence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 CNV genotypes was similar in AIH and in the background population. CONCLUSION: This study shows the effects of GSTM1 and GSTT1 CNV on AZA efficacy in AIH, not previously described. It also elaborates on the impact of the definition of treatment response, on the importance of the various GSTs studied. Furthermore, the GSTM1 and GSTT1 CNV frequencies previously reported in European populations were confirmed.",

Current treatments face challenges such as drug resistance, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and persistent inflammation. Glutathione (GSH) has the therapeutic potential to enhance treatment outcomes by improving antibiotic efficacy, reducing inflammation, and mitigating immune dysfunction. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through systematic searches of PubMed, Elsevier, WHO, and related databases. Inclusion criteria focused on preclinical and clinical research examining GSH or its precursors in HIV, TB, or co-infection, with emphasis on microbial control, immune modulation, and CNS-related outcomes. RESULTS: Preclinical studies showed that GSH improves macrophage antimicrobial function, reduces oxidative stress, and limits Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) growth. Animal models demonstrated reduced bacterial burden in the lungs, liver, and spleen with GSH supplementation, along with enhanced granuloma stability. Clinical studies highlighted increased TH1 cytokine production, reduced inflammatory markers, and improved CD4+ T cell counts in HIV-M.tb co-infected patients. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a GSH precursor, was shown to significantly enhance the efficacy of first-line TB antibiotics and mitigate treatment-associated toxicity. DISCUSSION: GSH shows promise as an adjunct therapy for HIV-M.tb co-infection, particularly for cases involving the CNS, where it may improve immune recovery and reduce inflammation. However, evidence is limited by small sample sizes and a lack of randomized trials. Future research should focus on developing CNS-directed GSH formulations and evaluating its integration into current treatment protocols to address the dual burden of HIV and TB, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cisplatin (DDP) resistance remains a primary cause of chemotherapy failure and recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Abnormal high microsomal glutathione transferase 1 (MGST1) expression has been found in DDP-resistant NSCLC cells. This study aimed to explore the function and mechanism of MGST1 in DDP resistance of NSCLC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of target molecules were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. Cell proliferation was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Ferroptosis was determined by malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), Fe2+, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The interaction between proteins was confirmed by Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). The effect of MGST1 on DDP resistance was evaluated using the tumor xenograft assay in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to measure Ki-67 and p-H2A.X expression in tumor tissues. RESULTS: MGST1 expression was higher, while arachidonate lipoxygenase 5 (ALOX5) expression was lower in DDP-resistant NSCLC patients and cells. MGST1 ablation sensitized NSCLC cells to DDP therapy through inducing ferroptosis. MGST1 protein directly interacted with ALOX5 protein to restrain ALOX5-triggered ferroptosis. Ferroptosis inhibitor or sh-ALOX5 reversed the promotive effect of MGST1 silencing on the DDP sensitivity of NSCLC cells. Finally, MGST1 depletion sensitized NSCLC cells to DDP therapy in nude mice in vivo. CONCLUSION: MGST1 high expression contributed to DDP resistance of NSCLC cells by inhibiting ALOX5-induced ferroptosis. Our results provide a potential therapeutic target for overcoming DDP resistance in NSCLC patients."

Mn3O4 nanoparticles with an ultrasmall size (4 nm) and mass production capability were developed with dual function of integrated tumor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and therapy. The high valence state of Mn3O4 nanocrystals enables a sensitive reaction with the glutathione (GSH) molecule and favorable decomposition ability, which further induces a unique, favorable, variable T 1 turn-off and T 2 turn-on MRI property. In addition, ultrasmall Mn3O4 nanoparticles reacted with high-level GSH in the tumor microenvironment induces responsive and enhanced variable T 1- and T 2-MRI imaging capability for accurate cancer diagnosis. Moreover, the synthesized ultrasmall Mn3O4 nanoparticles exhibit considerable ferroptosis effect towards tumor cells and excellent in vivo biocompatibility, thus indicating promising effective cancer treatment application. The developed ultrasmall Mn3O4 nanoparticles with integrated dual functions of GSH-responsive variable T 1 and T 2 MRI imaging effects and ferroptosis capability show promising potential as a candidate for tumor theranostics in clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Nanomedicine-driven ferroptosis has emerged as a promising tumor treatment strategy through delivering exogenous iron and aggravating the lethal accumulation of lipid peroxides (LPO). However, the compensatory mechanisms of ferroptosis defense systems in cancer cells compromise the therapeutic efficacy and lead to potential side effects. Herein, a highly effective ferroptotic nano-amplifier is designed to synergistically promote ferroptosis via increasing intracellular labile iron, exacerbating lipid peroxidation and overcoming the defense system. Briefly, a natural-derived amphiphilic polymer composing of chondroitin sulfate (CS), arachidonic acid (AA) and a redox-sensitive linker, cystamine (CYS) is constructed to self-assemble as a GSH-responsive nanodrug delivery system for loading bioactive ingredient Polyphyllin I (PPI) and ferric ion (Fe3+). This nanodrug (CSAA/Fe@PPI) can scavenge the aberrant intracellular GSH via CYS linker, accompanied with the degradation of CSAA/Fe@PPI and the release of PPI, AA and Fe3+. On one hand, the intracellular labile iron level is significantly elevated due to the exogenous delivery of Fe3+ and PPI-induced ferritinophagy. On the other hand, ROS burst and the supplement of AA initiate and propagate the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. Meanwhile, the depletion of intracellular GSH suppresses the GPX4 activity, further strengthening the lethal accumulation of LPO. Consequently, the ferroptotic antitumor efficacy is remarkably improved by systemically aggravating iron overload and lipid peroxidation. Therefore, our study presents an effective strategy to improve ferroptosis-based anti-cancer treatment through multiple intervention routes.",

In this study, cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cell lines were established, and untargeted metabolomics was used to detect differences in metabolite profiles between sensitive and resistant cell lines. It was found that glutathione metabolism significantly differed between the sensitive and resistant lines. Combining these findings with transcriptome data, correlation analysis of metabolites revealed that IDH2 regulated glutathione metabolism and contributed to cetuximab resistance in FaDu cells. In vitro experiments showed that IDH2 was highly expressed in FaDu-CR cells, and IDH2 knockdown significantly enhanced the sensitivity of FaDu and FaDu-CR cells to cetuximab. IDH2 knockdown reduced GSH levels and GPX4 expression in FaDu and FaDu-CR cells under cetuximab treatment, while increasing lipid ROS levels. In vivo experiments demonstrated that IDH2 knockdown decreased the tumorigenic ability of FaDu-CR cells in nude mice treated with cetuximab, as well as reduced GPX4 and Ki67 levels in tumor tissues. In conclusion, IDH2 regulated glutathione metabolism and contributed to cetuximab resistance in HNSCC. This study explores strategies to ameliorate cetuximab resistance in HNSCC preclinical models, providing new insights for reversing cetuximab resistance in HNSCC.",

      "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most common treatments for cancer. However, intracellular glutathione (GSH) plays a key role in protecting cancer from radiation damage. Herein, we have developed a platelet membrane biomimetic nanomedicine (PMD) that induces double GSH consumption to enhance tumor radioimmunotherapy. This biomimetic nanomedicine consists of an external platelet membrane and internal organic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MON) loaded with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Thanks to the tumor-targeting ability of the platelet membranes, PMD can target and aggregate to the tumor site, which is internalized by tumor cells. Within tumor cells overexpressing GSH, MON reacts with GSH to degrade and release 2-DG. This step initially depletes the intracellular GSH content. The subsequent release of 2-DG inhibits glycolysis and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, ultimately leading to secondary GSH consumption. This nanodrug combines dual GSH depletion, starvation therapy, and RT to promote immunogenic cell death and stimulate the systemic immune response. In the bilateral tumor model in vivo, distal tumor growth was also well suppressed. The proportion of mature dendritic cells (DC) and CD8+ T cells in the mice was increased. This indicates that PMD can promote anti-tumor radioimmunotherapy and has good prospects for clinical application."

Optimization of various cationic monomers, including newly synthesized cationic polyarginine, polyhistidine, and acrylated guanidine monomers, allowed fine-tuning of NG properties for mRNA binding. By incorporating a poly(ethylene) glycol-based disulphide crosslinker, we achieved glutathione-triggered mRNA release, enabling targeted intracellular delivery. Our NGs demonstrated superior encapsulation (up to 89.3 %) and loading (10.7 %) efficiencies, with controlled mRNA release kinetics at intracellular glutathione concentrations. NGs outperformed commercial transfection reagents across multiple cell lines, including traditionally difficult-to-transfect lines. We demonstrate the platform's versatility by successfully delivering GFP mRNA, Mango II RNA aptamers, and functionally relevant β2-AMPK mRNA. Furthermore, we used TIRF microscopy to measure exact RNA copy number within the NGs. Notably, mechanistic cellular uptake studies revealed that disulphide-containing NGs exhibit enhanced cellular uptake and endosomal escape, potentially due to interactions with cell surface thiols. This work represents a highly tuneable, efficient, and biocompatible platform for mRNA delivery with relevance for gene therapy and vaccine development."

The purpose is to determine whether Cur NCs can become a promising treatment option for diabetes nephropathy by reducing ferroptosis. METHODS: Cur-NCs were prepared using microfluidic technology and studied using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. HK-2 cells were treated with 30 mM HG to create a renal tubule damage cell model. Then, cell viability was evaluated in HK-2 cells treated with varying concentrations of Cur-NCs (0.23, 0.47, 0.94, 1.87, 3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/mL) using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Furthermore, in vivo experiments were carried out to investigate the roles of Cur-NCs in STZ-induced DN rats. RESULTS: The results showed that HG treatment greatly enhanced the levels of LDH, MDA, Iron, lipid ROS, apoptosis, NCOA4, TFR-1, while decreasing the expression of GSH, GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH-1. These effects induced by HG could be attenuated by Cur-NCs. Cur-NCs also reduced the HG-induced decrease in cell viability, as well as the increase in lipid ROS and cell apoptosis, however erastin could inhibit their effects. Furthermore, the in vivo results showed that Cur-NCs reduced ferroptosis and inhibited renal damage in DN rats. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Cur-NCs can significantly attenuate ferroptosis in a STZ-induced renal damage model by recovering GPX4, implying that Cur-NCs may be a promising therapy option for DN."

      "abstract": "Oxaliplatin (OXA), a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent, remains a mainstay in first-line treatments for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the eventual development of OXA resistance represents a significant clinical challenge. In the present study, we demonstrate that the aldo-keto reductase 1C1 (AKR1C1) is overexpressed in CRC cells upon acquisition of OXA resistance, evident in OXA-resistant CRC cell lines. We employed genetic silencing and pharmacological inhibition strategies to establish that suppression of AKR1C1 restores OXA sensitivity. Mechanistically, AKR1C1 interacts with and activates the transcription factor STAT3, which upregulates the glutamate transporter EAAT3, thereby elevating intracellular glutathione levels and conferring OXA resistance. Alantolactone, a potent natural product inhibitor of AKR1C1, effectively reverses this chemoresistance, restricting the growth of OXA-resistant CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings uncover a critical AKR1C1-dependent mechanism behind OXA resistance and propose a promising combinatorial therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance in CRC."

      "abstract": "Radiation therapy is one of the most effective treatments for approximately 60% of patients with cancer. During radiation exposure, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupts the lipid layer of the membrane, leading to subsequent peroxide radical formation. Cimetidine (Cim) and famotidine (Fam) are histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2 blocker), also known as peptic ulcer drugs, that exert radioprotective effects. Vitamin C (Vit.C) is an effective free radical and ROS scavenger with significant radioprotective effects. In this experimental study, male mice (6-8 weeks and 28 ± 3 g) were used in five groups. To evaluate ionizing radiation, gamma rays were used at two doses of 2 and 4 Gy and different doses of Cim, Fam, and Vit.C administered as the protectives. Finally, the livers of the mice were isolated and homogenized. The levels of lipid peroxidase and reduced and oxidized glutathione were measured using standard methods. With increasing radiation dose, lipid peroxidase activity, GSSG level, and glutathione content increased. The findings showed that in the drug-only group, Vit.C had better protection than the other two drugs, and the combination of the three drugs had excellent radiation protection. Radiation protection of normal cells in radiotherapy is a valuable necessity. A number of drugs can protect cells against ionizing radiation through different mechanisms. The results suggest that Fam, Cim, and Vit.C can be radioprotective individually or in combination."

The levels of its intracellular concentration permit detailed investigation of the tumor microenvironment. However, low polarization and weak Raman scattering cross-section make direct and indirect Raman detection challenging. This study designs an amorphous-crystalline urchin-like TiO2 (AC-UL-TiO2) for the accurate identification of GSH and GSSG. By synergistically regulating the crystalline core and amorphous shell, the bandgap structure is optimized, thereby enhancing charge transfer efficiency. AC-UL-TiO2 demonstrates excellent SERS performance in detecting dye molecules with good selectivity for mixed analytes.

A SERS-colorimetric dual-modality platform is developed based on the AC-UL-TiO2@DTNB system to accurately monitor GSH concentrations from 0 to 1000 µM, providing a robust dual-confirmation result. Importantly, combined with the principal component analysis method, the AC-UL-TiO2 SERS platform can directly distinguish GSH and GSSG molecules. Besides, direct SERS detection LOD for GSH and GSSG are 10-8 M, which is 100 times higher than that of indirect detection.

This research assessed how phytic acid affects the antioxidant capacity and quality of R. roxburghii fruit while in the postharvest storage period and reveals its potential mechanism of action. The findings suggested that phytic acid treatment inhibits the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhances the activities and expressions of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) while decreasing the generation of superoxide anions (O2•-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

It also increases the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH), while reducing the production of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Moreover, phytic acid treatment enhances the ratios of AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG, maintaining the reduced state of the fruit.

      "abstract": "In this paper, a pH-sensitive chitosan-grafted phenylboronic acid (CS-BA)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel was constructed based on dynamic borate bonding for loading chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin (CDDP) and divalent Cu2+ (CS-BA/PVA-Cu2+-CDDP). The hydrogel can respond and degrade specifically in the simulative acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), and the released Cu2+ can deplete glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells and generate Cu+. It is worth noting that, Cu+ can further catalyze the Fenton-like reaction to generate cancer cell-toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH•). More importantly, the depletion of GSH resulted in a reduction of the CDDP-GSH binding, allowing a fast CDDP release within the tumor cells, which significantly enhanced its anti-tumor efficacy. Meanwhile, the significantly reduced GSH can also protect the generated OH• from removal and enhance its therapeutic effect. In vitro antitumor experiments demonstrated that the CS-BA/PVA-Cu2+-CDDP hydrogel has excellent biosafety and synergistic chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to inhibit tumor growth. Organoid experiments further demonstrated that CDDP and Cu2+ encapsulated in the hydrogel enhanced their therapeutic efficacy. This study reveals the potential application of CDDP and Cu2+ in the combined therapy of colon cancer.",

Various concentration of bleaching agents can influence the bonding of the restoration to the tooth. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of glutathione on bond strength of composite resin to enamel following extra coronal bleaching at two different time intervals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty molars were randomly assigned into four groups of ten each. Group A: Bleaching followed by immediate composite build up and no antioxidant application. Group B: bleaching followed by application of 20% Glutathione and immediate composite built-up was done. Group C: Bleaching followed by composite restoration after one week. Group D: Bleaching followed by application of 20% Glutathione before composite build up after one week. Shear bond strength was tested using a universal testing machine and fracture analysis was done using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc test with 95% level of significance (p<0.05). RESULTS: Group D, which was treated with glutathione and restored after one week, revealed the highest shear bond strength compared to group B which was immediately restored following treatment with glutathione. CONCLUSION: Addition of 20% Glutathione as an antioxidant increased the shear bond strength of composite resin to enamel following extra-coronal bleaching using 40% hydrogen peroxide."

      "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses a significant global health threat, especially when it involves the central nervous system (CNS). Tuberculous meningitis (TBM), a severe manifestation of TB, is linked to high mortality rates and long-term neurological complications, further exacerbated by drug resistance and immune evasion mechanisms employed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Although pulmonary TB remains the primary focus of research, MDR-TBM introduces unique challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. The effectiveness of current treatments is frequently compromised by poor CNS penetration of anti-TB drugs and the necessity for prolonged therapy, which often involves considerable toxicity. This review explores the potential of cytokine-based adjunct immunotherapies for MDR-TBM, addressing the challenges of balancing pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals within the CNS. A central focus is the prospective role of glutathione, not only in reducing oxidative stress but also in enhancing host immune defenses against Mtb's immune evasion strategies. Furthermore, the development of vaccines aimed at upregulating glutathione synthesis in macrophages represents a promising strategy to bolster the immune response and improve treatment outcomes. By integrating glutathione and innovative vaccine approaches into MDR-TBM management, this review proposes a comprehensive strategy that targets Mtb directly while supporting immune modulation, with the potential to enhance patient outcomes and reduce treatment related adverse effects. We underscore the urgent need for further research into adjunctive therapies and immunomodulatory strategies to more effectively combat MDR-TBM."

There is poor understanding of how bacteria directly or through herbicide degradation affect the biochemical processes in plants exposed to sulfonylurea herbicides. In this study, treatment with a combination of herbicide metsulfuron-methyl (MSM) and bacteria (Pseudomonas protegens DA1.2 or P. chlororaphis 4CH) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.) plants was carried out. Activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), an important enzyme for the herbicide detoxification, and acetolactate synthase (ALS), a target for MSM in plants, was measured by spectrophotometric assays. MSM residues were analyzed using the HPLC-MS. Then, 24 h after bacterial treatment, GST activity increased by 75-91% in wheat and by 38-94% in canola. On the 30th day, a decrease in MSM in the soil associated with bacterial treatment was 54.6-79.7%. An increase in GST activity and acceleration of MSM degradation were accompanied by a decrease in inhibition of the ALS enzyme in plants, which indicated a mitigation of the toxic effect. The results obtained are evidence that rhizospheric bacteria can have beneficial effects on plants exposed to MSM due to the combination of abilities to directly affect detoxification enzymes in plants and degrade MSM in the soil."

To delineate the cause, Gstt2 knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) C57Bl/6J mice were implanted with tumors before treatment with BCG or saline. RNA was analyzed via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). BCG induced PD-L1 expression in WT mice bladders, while pro-inflammatory TNF-α was upregulated in KO bladders. ScRNA-seq analysis showed that Gstt2 WT mice bladders had a higher proportion of matrix remodeling fibroblasts, M2 macrophages, and neuronal cells. In KO mice, distinct tumor cell types, activated fibroblasts, and M1 macrophages were enriched in the bladders. In WT bladders, the genes expressed supported tumorigenesis and immunosuppressive PD-L1 expression. In contrast, Gstt2 KO bladders expressed genes involved in inflammation, immune activation, and tumor suppression. An 11-gene signature (Hmga2, Peak 1, Kras, Slc2a1, Ankfn1, Ahnak, Cmss1, Fmo5, Gphn, Plec, Gstt2), derived from the scRNA-seq analysis predicted response in NMIBC patients (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database).

      "abstract": "Pharmacological treatment of diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction (DMED) has become increasingly challenging due to the limited efficacy of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). As the global prevalence of DM continues, there is a critical need for novel therapeutic strategies to address DMED. In our previous studies, we found that Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a ferroptosis inhibitor, can ameliorate DMED in diabetic rats. However, the specific role of GPX4 in corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs) and its regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established primary cultures of CCSMCs and systematically analyzed the role of GPX4 under high-glucose conditions. To further elucidate the upstream regulatory pathways of GPX4, we employed immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to identify potential interacting proteins. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays were conducted to explore the regulatory dynamics and post-translational stability of GPX4. Under high-glucose conditions, the expression of GPX4 in CCSMCs is significantly downregulated, leading to an increase in intracellular oxidative stress and heightened levels of ferroptosis, accompanied by dysfunction in smooth muscle cell relaxation. Furthermore, the CHX chase assay revealed that high glucose accelerates GPX4 protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Subsequent IP-MS identified NEDD4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a potential interacting partner of GPX4. Further validation demonstrated that NEDD4 modulates the ubiquitination process of GPX4, thereby influencing its stability and expression. In conclusion, we identified NEDD4 as a key regulator of GPX4 stability through ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. These findings suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting the NEDD4-GPX4 axis to alleviate DMED pathology.",

The alterations in GSTα protein levels associated with Alzheimer's disease and their impact on cognitive abilities remain unclear. Thus, investigating the fluctuations of GSTα protein levels in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential. METHODS: DATA were enrolled from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and we studied healthy individuals (as controls, a total of 54), patients with mild cognitive impairment (345), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (96) A one-year follow-up was conducted to collect data on the dynamic changes of GSTα protein levels in plasma and primary information data, and to analyze the correlation between the changes in GSTα protein levels before and after the follow-up and cognitive function and its predictive value. RESULTS: Plasma GSTα protein levels were significantly lower in the AD group than in the CN group (0.94 vs1.05, p = 0.04) and the MCI group (0.94 vs1.09, p < 0.001). Plasma GSTα protein level changes were positively correlated with altered MMSE levels in MCI and AD patients (r = 0.09, p = 0.04). The AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels for MCI was 0.63 (0.54-0.71), p = 0.02, and the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels for AD was 0.74 (0.69-0.80), p < 0.001. At the same time, we plotted ROC curves for the difference in the change of plasma GSTα protein levels after 1 year of follow-up. The results showed that the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels change for MCI was 0.76 (0.696-0.83), p < 0.001, and the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels change for AD was 0.75 (0.69-0.80), p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicated notable differences in GSTα protein levels among patients with MCI and those with AD after a one-year follow-up period. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between changes in GST αprotein levels and the decline in both baseline and cognitive function. This suggests that GSTα protein could potentially act as a biomarker for both MCI and AD, offering fresh insights for early detection and intervention strategies."

      "abstract": "Despite the potential of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in treating malignant tumors, the lack of effective sonosensitizers has limited its clinical implementation. In this study, we explored the relationship between the heteroatom doping concentration in metal-organic frameworks and interface formation after pyrolysis by regulating the addition of manganese sources and successfully derived Z-scheme heterojunctions MnxOy/(A/R)TiO2 (MTO) in situ from MIL-125-NH2 (Ti/Mn). The electron transfer pathway introduced by interfacial contact promoted carrier separation and greatly preserved the effective redox components, significantly influencing the performance of reactive oxygen species generation. Upon reaching the tumor sites, MTO effectively depleted glutathione to alleviate the suppressive tumor environment, and the heterojunctions and MnxOy in MTO facilitated SDT and synergistic chemodynamic therapy (CDT), respectively, leading to enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD). Furthermore, Mn2+ uptake by dendritic cells (DCs) and the tumor-associated antigens released due to ICD activated the stimulator of interferon genes pathway, which elicited a robust tumor-specific immune response by driving the maturation of DCs and the activation of T cells. In addition, the activated T cells secreted high levels of interferon-γ to enhance Mn3+/Mn2+-mediated ferroptosis in metastatic tumor cells. The combination of MTO-mediated synergistic therapy and PD-L1 checkpoint blockade exhibited vaccine-like functions, inducing stronger systemic immunity and durable immune memory to inhibit tumor progression, metastasis, and recurrence. To summarize, we synthesized a self-enhancing nanoplatform for synergistic SDT/CDT/immunotherapy using multifunctional MOF-derived Z-scheme heterojunctions. This study provides an experimental basis for amplifying the potential of sonosensitizers while optimizing SDT-mediated systemic immunity while avoiding interference caused by additional adjuvants.",

      "abstract": "The self-assembly of hydrophobic organic phototherapeutic agents (OPTAs) with expansive planar structures into nanoparticles (NPs) represents a pivotal strategy to bolster their biocompatibility. However, the tight molecular packing within these NPs significantly influences the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), posing a substantial hurdle to elevating the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) for such NPs. In this article, three OPTAs by donor engineering are synthesized. Notably, 4,8-Bis (5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)-6-(2-ethylhexyl)-[1,2,5] thiadiazole [3,4-F] benzotriazole (BTBT), which incorporates a benzene ring as the donor, exhibits the highest ROS generation and optimal photothermal conversion capability. To further augment the overall phototheranostic potential of BTBT NPs, a glutathione (GSH)-driven disassembly strategy is employed. This strategy not only alleviates the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect on ROS but also facilitates enhanced free molecular rotation. As a result, the ROS production sees a tenfold increase, and the photothermal conversion temperature rises by 8.3 °C, achieving a PCE of 77.03%. In summary, a versatile disassembly strategy is proposed that concurrently enhances the performance of both PDT and PTT in planar OPTAs, while also advancing the state-of-the-art in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment.",

      "abstract": "Lactate-mediated lactylation on target proteins is recently identified as the novel posttranslational modification with profound biological functions. RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification possesses dynamic and reversible nature, suggesting that activity of its methyltransferase NSUN2 is actively regulated. However, how NSUN2 activity is response to acidic condition in tumor microenvironment and then regulates cancer cell survival remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that NSUN2 activity is enhanced by lactate-mediated lactylation at lysine 508, which then targets glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) mRNA to facilitates GCLC m5C formation and mRNA stabilization. The activated GCLC induces higher level of intracellular GSH accompanied by decreased lipid peroxidation and resistant phenotype to ferroptosis induction by doxorubicin (Dox) in gastric cancer cells. Specifically, the effect of NSUN2 lactylation-GCLC-GSH pathway is nearly lost when NSUN2 K508R or GCLC C-A mutant (five cytosine sites) was introduced into the cancer cells. We further identify the catalytic subunit N-α-acetyltransferase 10 (NAA10) as the lactytransferase of NSUN2, and lactate treatment substantially enhances their association and consequent NSUN2 activation. Taken together, our findings convincingly elucidate the signaling axis of NAA10-NSUN2-GCLC that potently antagonizes the ferroptosis under acidic condition, and therefore, targeting NSUN2 lactylation might be an effective strategy in improving the prognosis of cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Mutation of genes related to the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is detected in 20% of all cancers. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex comprises about 15 subunits and is classified into three subcomplexes: cBAF, PBAF, and ncBAF. Previously, we showed that ovarian clear cell carcinoma cells deficient in ARID1A, a subunit of the cBAF complex, are synthetic lethal with several genes required for glutathione (GSH) synthesis and are therefore sensitive to the GSH inhibitor eprenetapopt (APR-246). However, we do not know whether cancer cells deficient in SWI/SNF components other than ARID1A are selectively sensitive to treatment with eprenetapopt. Here, we show that SMARCA4-, SMARCB1-, and PBRM1-deficient cells are more sensitive to eprenetapopt than SWI/SNF-proficient cells. We found that deficiency of SMARCA4, SMARCB1, or PBRM1 attenuates transcription of the SLC7A11 gene (which supplies cysteine as a raw metabolic material for GSH synthesis) by the failure of recruitment of cBAF and PBAF to the promotor and enhancer regions of the SLC7A11 locus, thereby reducing basal levels of GSH. In addition, eprenetapopt decreased the amount of intracellular GSH and increased the intracellular amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by induction of apoptosis. Taken together, eprenetapopt could be a promising selective agent for SWI/SNF-deficient cancer cells derived from SMARCA4-deficient lung cancers, SMARCB1-deficient rhabdoid tumors, and PBRM1-deficient kidney cancers.",

      "abstract": "Depleted uranium (DU) is a byproduct of uranium enrichment, which can cause heavy-metal toxicity and radiation toxicity as well as serious damage to the kidneys. However, the mechanism of renal injury induced by DU is still unclear. This study aimed to explore the role of ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1) in DU-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Using ETHE1 gene knockout C57BL/6 mice (10 mg/kg DU) and renal cell models (500 µM DU) exposed to DU, we observed significantly reduced levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and glutathione (GSH), alongside decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and increased oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that knocking out or silencing ETHE1 led to a significant reduction in H2S and GSH levels, whereas the opposite occurred when was ETHE1 overexpressed. When the H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide and GSH precursor N-acetylcysteine were used to treat animals or cells, cellular ATP levels were increased, oxidative stress markers were reduced, and kidney damage was mitigated. In addition, H2S and GSH interacted with each other after DU poisoning. These findings suggest that the ETHE1/H2S/GSH pathway plays a critical role in mediating DU-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in renal cells, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the harmful effects of DU. Thus, this study expands our understanding of DU-induced renal damage pathways, providing avenues for further research and intervention strategies.",

      "abstract": "Nanozymes can improve reactive oxygen species (ROS)-based cancer therapies by targeting cancer cells' antioxidant defense mechanisms, particularly glutathione (GSH) depletion, to overcome ROS-resistant cancer cells. Nanozymes, innovative enzyme-mimetic nanomaterials, can generate ROS, alter the tumor microenvironment (TME), and synergize with photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT), radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. This review shows how nanozymes catalyze ROS generation, selectively deplete GSH, and target cancer elimination, offering clear advantages over standard therapies. Nanozymes selectively target cancer cells' antioxidant defenses to improve PDT, CDT, and radiation therapies. To maximize nanozyme-based cancer treatment efficacy, biodistribution, biocompatibility, and tumor heterogeneity must be assessed. To improve cancer treatment, multifunctional, stimuli-responsive nanozymes and synergistic combination drugs should be developed.",
