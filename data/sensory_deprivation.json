MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, CİNAHL, Embase, Cochrane Library, and YÖK Thesis Center databases was conducted from August 2023 to May 2024, without any temporal restrictions. In addition, a physical search was made in the university library for grey literature. RESULTS: The study revealed that nurses' psychosocial interventions significantly improved patients' level of consciousness (SMD = 1.042, %95 CI = 0.716 to 1.369; Z = 6.25; p < .05) and sleep quality in ICUs (SMD=1.21, 95% CI= 0.232 to 1.810; Z = 2.49; p < .05). The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions varied based on the type of intervention, patient age, ICU type, patient group, and intervention duration. Notably, auditory stimuli and aromatherapy demonstrated particularly high effect sizes, significantly enhancing patients' levels of consciousness and sleep quality. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing sensory deprivation in intensive care units exert beneficial effects on individuals, notably enhancing their level of consciousness and improving sleep quality.",

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, single-session, double-blind experimental study among 65 participants who had LBP for more than 14 days. Postural stability was assessed by measuring the center of pressure (COP) range, displacement area, and velocity in anterior-posterior and mediolateral directions under four sensory and cognitive conditions: (i) eyes open and counting forward, (ii) eyes closed and counting forward, (iii) eyes closed and counting forward in multiples of seven, and (iv) eyes closed and counting backward in multiples of seven. The participants were stratified into low-/medium- (n = 53) and high-risk (n = 9) subgroups. RESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences among patients with LBP stratified as having a low/medium or high risk of chronicity in postural stability and sensory and cognitive conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired postural stability is important to consider when treating patients with LBP. However, we found that these impairments were not strongly aggravated in groups with a higher risk of chronicity, as measured using the STarT Back Tool.",

AIMS/OBJECTIVES: Evaluating reversibility of a sensory understimulation. MATERIAL/METHODS: Two groups of five students, each, (sensory and not sensory deprived) were evaluated at ages 5 and 11. Both groups were taught the compulsory national educational program. The sensory deprived group also had a 5-year rehabilitation program. After that time, their language and vocabulary were reevaluated. RESULTS: Both groups became able to read, write and perform mathematical operations. Both groups took the compulsory elementary school national performance test and all of them performed above the national average. Despite these good performances the differences between both groups regarding language persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in children with early sensory deprivation are improved with rehabilitation programs. In order to achieve better restoration, intervention should be done earlier than at 5 years of age. Even if some deficits are not fully reversible, the improvement is significant and allows social inclusion and the possibility of breaking their circle of vulnerability. SIGNIFICANCE: Documenting the importance of early rehabilitation in sensory deficits.",

      "abstract": "Animals use a suite of sensory modalities to precisely locate and capture prey. While numerous studies have examined the effects of sensory deprivation on the behaviors leading to prey capture and while it is generally believed that information in the pre-strike period determines the way fish capture prey, this study is the first to examine the contribution of sensory information to jaw kinematics during capture. Largemouth bass were filmed using high-speed videography while capturing live mosquitofish. Bass were examined intact, with visual deprivation under infrared light, and with lateral line deprivation following treatment with cobalt chloride. Deprived of visual cues, this visual ram-feeding predator switches towards suction-based feeding to successfully capture prey. They approach prey slowly but open their mouths more rapidly, which has been shown to result in greater buccal pressure, causing their prey to move a greater distance at a more rapid velocity as they are being drawn into the predators' mouths. Deprived of lateral line cues, bass have higher forward velocities during capture and capture prey earlier in the gape cycle. This study demonstrates that sensory pre-strike information directly affects the capture modality employed by fishes and that fish can modulate between ram and suction not only by adjusting the amount of ram by increasing or decreasing their movements, but also by actively increasing the amount of suction used. These results suggest that the ability to modulate feeding behavior may allow animals to not only exploit a broader breadth of prey items, but also to be capable of doing so in a wider variety of environments.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is considered to be a neurodevelopmental disorder with origins in the prenatal or neonatal period. Brains from subjects with schizophrenia have enlarged ventricles, reduced cortical thickness (CT) and increased neuronal density in the prefrontal cortex compared with those from normal subjects. Subjects with schizophrenia have reduced pain sensitivity and niacin skin flare responses, suggesting that capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent neurons might be abnormal in schizophrenia. This study tested the hypothesis that intrinsic somatosensory deprivation, induced by neonatal capsaicin treatment, causes changes in the brains of rats similar to those found in schizophrenia. Wistar rats were treated with capsaicin, 50 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously, or vehicle (control) at 24-36 h of life. At 5-7 weeks behavioural observations were made, and brains removed, fixed and sectioned. The mean body weight of capsaicin-treated rats was not significantly different from control, but the mean brain weight of male, but not female, rats, was significantly lower than control. Capsaicin-treated rats were hyperactive compared with controls. The hyperactivity was abolished by haloperidol. Coronal brain sections of capsaicin-treated rats had smaller cross-sectional areas, reduced CT, larger ventricles and aqueduct, smaller hippocampal area and reduced corpus callosum thickness, than brain sections from control rats. Neuronal density was increased in several cortical areas and the caudate putamen, but not in the visual cortex. It is concluded that neonatal capsaicin treatment of rats produces brain changes that are similar to those found in brains of subjects with schizophrenia.",

The concept of neuro-occupation provides a basis to understand how the nervous system is intertwined with all aspects of occupational performance. This paper uses the framework of neuro-occupation to link a neurological system, the reticular activating system (RAS), to the performance of self-care by patients in an intensive care setting. This correlation is made because the RAS is responsible for organizing sensory information. Inappropriate amounts of stimulation effect the RAS and result in sensory deprivation or sensory overload, which negatively impacts occupational performance. Implications for occupational therapy practice are also addressed."

Within the literature there are a number of research studies which have investigated the concept of sensory deprivation and these are considered. The studies indicate the potential of sensory input as a field of research in particular relation to the care of patients within hospital settings where they are removed from their 'normal' level of sensory input and could subsequently experience sensory deprivation. The relationship between sensory restriction and chronic pain is emphasized. This links with investigations of sensory stimulation (Snoezelen) as a potential strategy for the management of chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it is suggested that sensory deprivation cannot exist and the term 'sensory restriction' would be more appropriate. It is proposed that there is a need to develop a tool to assist carers in identifying the existence of sensory restriction in their specific client groups to provide a basis for intervention.",

      "abstract": "Auditory brainstem neurons probably depend on afferent input to maintain calcium homeostasis within a narrow range. These neurons are endowed with high concentrations of the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calretinin, and calbindin D28k that are presumed to buffer cytosolic calcium transients. To determine the effects of functional deafferentation on these proteins in the auditory brainstem of adult guinea pigs, we have manipulated the sensory input with an intracochlear perfusion of the glutamate agonist alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA), which is known to transiently disconnect inner hair cells and primary auditory dendrites. Semiquantitative measures of immunostaining intensities showed rapid and reversible changes in calcium-binding protein levels. By 24 hours after AMPA treatment, calretinin immunostaining was reduced in deafferented neurons of the cochlear nuclei and their axons in the superior olivary nuclei. In contrast, calbindin D28k immunoreactivity levels by this time were higher in deafferented neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and their axons in the lateral superior olivary nucleus (LSO). Parvalbumin immunostaining was also generally increased in deafferented neurons, but changes were less evident and more complex. The changes in all three immunoreactivities disappeared with the progressive restoration of afferent input. Normal levels were reestablished by 5 days after AMPA treatment, when afferent activity had almost completely recovered. These results show that calcium-binding protein immunostaining in auditory neurons is functionally responsive to afferent activity. The increased buffering capacity in deafferented neurons as shown by the rises in parvalbumin and calbindin D28k immunostaining may be part of mechanisms promoting neuronal survival after loss of sensory input. This input, on the other hand, may be necessary for maintaining the high calretinin levels normally present in cochlear nucleus neurons.",

To define potential commonalities in information processing in different systems, we investigated molecular changes elicited by sensory deprivation in the developing rat olfactory and visual systems. Protein kinase C (PKC), an intracellular messenger implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory, was analyzed. Initial, developmental studies indicated that PKC activity in the soluble and particulate fractions of the olfactory bulb increased three- to fourfold from birth to 3 months of age. Unilateral olfactory deprivation prevented the developmental increase in both soluble and particulate PKC activities in the ipsilateral olfactory bulb and piriform cortex, the second-order relay. Phorbol ester binding localized PKC to intrinsic neuronal populations and their dendrites in the control and deprived bulbs. Moreover, PKC was similarly lower in the visual cortex of dark-reared rats than in light-reared controls. The changes in PKC were region specific, as activity was unchanged by either treatment in the parietal cortex, a control area that does not process primary olfactory or visual information. Our results suggest that the important intracellular messenger, PKC, is similarly regulated in entirely different sensory systems by different environmental stimuli. Consequently, different sensory systems may use common molecular mechanisms to process information.",

There was a significant linear trend relating time in confinement to reduction in mean post-treatment smoking rate. A measure of cigarette craving while confined did not predict treatment outcome. Craving while confined for 24 hours exhibited a cubic trend, indicating a diurnal rhythm. Differences between the two 24 hour conditions were nonsignificant, but suggested that social isolation may be therapeutically preferable to sensory deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Most afferent inputs are sensory stimulants, and physical activity is probably one of the most significant of all sensory stimulations. Gravity is a constant stimulus. These demands are also known as stress, and the stressor effect as the general adaptation syndrome (Selye). In this study, these demands are called sensory afferent stimuli, which are necessary triggers to start the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal mechanism and thus maintain the general mechanical, autonomic and metabolic functions of the body in the state of homeostasis. If the sensory stimulus is removed, there is no stressor effect and the cycle of response is eliminated. This results in a decreased hypothalamus-pituitary response and a decreased production of ACTH and corticoids. A decrease in the sensory input creates changes in the central nervous system and in the musculoskeletal system which are compatible with lack of the hypothalamus-pituitary responses. When a person becomes ill, physical inactivity as well as sensory and perceptual deprivation are at a maximum, and the absence of these stimuli interrupts the cycle of homeostasis. Physical activity is one of the most important stressors (sensory input) or triggering mechanisms for the cycle of homeostasis (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cycle). Therefore, it is imperative to provide the patient with physical activities which ensure motion and take into account the effect of gravity. This is best accomplished by a program of physical, occupational and recreational therapy.",

After 8 hours of lying on a bed in a dark, silent room, they indicated on various measures that they had found the experience to be quite pleasant; in fact, they indicated that they had more frequent positive experiences and less frequent negative experiences than in normal life. This finding indicates that sensory deprivation may be an acceptable treatment modality for alcoholics, as it has been for other clinical population.",

They tend to remain in a state of physical inactivity and sensory deprivation. The signs and symptoms of head injury associated with the hip fracture may be overlooked and attributed to sensory deprivation. Thirty-nine patients with fractured hip and 18 with multiple fractures were studied by means of electroencephalography, echoencephalography, and computer axial tomography. In 7, the findings indicated a cerebral lesion. At operation, a subdural hematoma was found in 5 patients and a tumor in 2; all but one made a dramatic recovery. Thus, after hip fracture, it is important that the patient be tested appropriately so that signs and symptoms of sensory deprivation may not be confused with those of an occult head injury. When indicated, surgical intervention may be a life-saving process.",

The effect sensory deprivation, early in development, has on the adult response properties of identified neurones was studied in the abdominal nervous system of the cricket Acheta domesticus.2. Neural activity in the cercal-to-giant interneurone system was lowered by blocking the movement of the mechanosensitive hairs, located on each cercus, with a facial cleansing cream.3. When specimens were treated unilaterally one of a pair of homologous neurones exhibited drastically altered response properties. The neurone which received its afferent input from the treated receptors was much less sensitive to tones. Its threshold was increased approximately 20 db with respect to its untreated homologue.4. Bilateral treatment lowered the responsiveness of both of the bilaterally homologous neurones.5. Increased levels of inhibition impinging on the treated neurones accounts for part of the altered responsiveness. The inhibitory pathway is activated by the untreated mechanoreceptors.6. Control experiments demonstrate that the sensory apparatus is not injured or modified by the treatment.7. The results suggest that normal development of some invertebrate neural pathways may be more dependent on experience during ontogeny than has previously been assumed.",

      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",
