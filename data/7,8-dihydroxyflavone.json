      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Angiostrongylus cantonensis triggers eosinophilic meningitis and/or eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in humans, potentially causing permanent central nervous system damage. While corticosteroids may ease infection-induced headaches, they prove ineffective against A. cantonensis larvae or neuronal injuries. Conversely, anthelmintics and neuroprotective agents like 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), activating BDNF/TrkB signaling, offer promise. METHODS: This study aimed to assess neural structure, brain function impairment and recovery, and pathological symptoms and cell death in A. cantonensis-infected C57BL/6 mice before and after treatment with 7,8-DHF or Albendazole alone, and in combination with 7,8-DHF/Albendazole. RESULTS: All treatment groups effectively mitigated infection-induced weight loss in mice. Those receiving 7,8-DHF or combined treatment displayed significant improvements in motor and balance abilities during the rotarod test. Post-treatment, infected mice showed enhanced spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze test. Golgi staining revealed that strategies involving 7,8-DHF reduced infection-induced synaptic loss. A. cantonensis infection induced severe inflammatory responses and brain damage in mice. Albendazole alone and the combined 7,8-DHF/Albendazole treatment effectively alleviated inflammation-related pathological phenomena. Analysis of neuronal functional protein expression across different brain regions showed increased presynaptic proteins following 7,8-DHF treatment. Moreover, 7,8-DHF treatment alone or combined with Albendazole prevented brain injury without inducing cell death in infected mice. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that 7,8-DHF could confer neuroprotective effects, particularly in mitigating synaptic loss in the presynaptic region, and alleviating behavioral deficits from infection without inducing cell death. We anticipate these results will aid in the treatment of angiostrongyliasis-induced neurological damage."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To analyze the response of different retinal ganglion cell (RGC) populations to NMDA-induced retinal excitotoxicity and the effect of an intraperitoneal treatment with 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a potent selective TrkB agonist. METHODS: Adult albino rats were treated the day prior to NMDA injection and the three following days with intraperitoneal vehicle (1 %DMSO in 0.09 %NaCl) or DHF (5 mg/kg in vehicle) injections. DHF-afforded protection was studied in the population of Brn3a+RGCs, OPN+RGCs (α-RGCs), OPN+ Tbr2+RGCs (αONs-RGCs), OPN+ Tbr2-Brn3a-RGCs (αONt-RGCs) and OPN+Brn3a+RGCs (αOFF-RGCs) at 3,7,14, or 21 days. The functional response was analyzed longitudinally with full-field electroretinograms. The mechanisms underlying DHF-afforded neuroprotection were assessed by western blot (WB) analysis of the levels of phosphorylated and total TrkB, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PIK3/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). RESULTS: NMDA intravitreal injection resulted in a significant diminution of the mean amplitudes of the pSTR and b-waves, as well as in severe depletion of all RGCs studied except αONt-RGCs. DHF treatment resulted in rescued mean amplitudes of the pSTR and b-waves up to 21 days after NMDA. WB analysis revealed an increase in p-TrkB which correlates to the increase of TRKB protein and an increase in normalized pAKT/AKT. pMAPK/MAPK was upregulated earlier and significantly higher in DHF-treated retinas. DHF afforded survival of up to 49 % of the Brn3a+RGCs versus 25 % of the vehicle group at 21 days after NMDA, and improved survival of the α-RGC and αONs-RGCs but did not rescue the αOFF-RGCs. CONCLUSION: Different RGC types exhibit variable susceptibilities to NMDA injury, and DHF-mediated activation of TrkB affords neuroprotection.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a promising translational therapy in several brain injury models, including the neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) model in mice. However, the neuroprotective effect of 7,8-DHF was only observed in female, but not male, neonatal mice with HI brain injury. It is unknown whether HI-induced physiological changes affect brain distribution of 7,8-DHF differently for male versus female mice. We aimed to evaluate the impact of sex on the pharmacokinetics of 7,8-DHF in plasma and brain neonatal mice following experimentally induced HI brain injury. METHODS: Left-sided HI brain injury was induced in postnatal day 9 (P9) mice, followed by a 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of 7,8-DHF. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to quantitate the drug concentration in plasma samples, as well as in samples from the left and right brain hemispheres. A nonlinear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the plasma and brain concentration-time data. A semi-quantitative approach was used to evaluate the concentrations of two active O-methylated metabolites of 7,8-DHF (8H7M-flavone and 7H8M-flavone) in both plasma and brain samples. RESULTS: Our PK analyses show that plasma 7,8-DHF concentrations followed a two-compartment PK model, with more than 95% eliminated by 3 h after the IP injection. Sex was not significantly associated with the PK of 7,8-DHF; however, HI brain injury was associated with a 21% reduction in clearance (p < 0.01). The distribution of 7,8-DHF to the brain was rapid; however, the extent of brain distribution was low with the right and left brain-to-plasma partition coefficients being 8.6% and 9.9%, respectively. Additionally, both O-methylated metabolites of 7,8-DHF were detected in the plasma and brain. CONCLUSION: The plasma and brain PK of 7,8-DHF in neonatal mice were similar between males and females. The low extent of 7,8-DHF brain distribution and the potential effects of the active metabolites should be considered in future studies evaluating the therapeutic effects of 7,8-DHF."

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, not least in the elderly. The incidence of aged TBI patients has increased dramatically during the last decades. High age is a highly negative prognostic factor in TBI, and pharmacological treatment options are lacking. We used the controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI model in 23-month-old male and female mice and analyzed the effect of post-injury treatment with 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mimetic compound, on white matter pathology. Following CCI or sham injury, mice received subcutaneous 7,8-DHF injections (5 ​mg/kg) 30 ​min post-injury and were sacrificed on 2, 7 or 14 days post-injury (dpi) for histological and immunofluorescence analyses. Histological assessment with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB)/Cresyl Violet stain showed that administration of 7,8-DHF resulted in preserved white matter tissue at 2 and 7 dpi with no difference in cortical tissue loss at all investigated time points. Treatment with 7,8-DHF led to reduced axonal swellings at 2 and 7 dpi, as visualized by SMI-31 (Neurofilament Heavy Chain) immunofluorescence, and reduced number of TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling)/CC1-positive mature oligodendrocytes at 2 dpi in the perilesional white matter. Post-injury proliferation of Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFRα)-positive oligodendodrocyte progenitor cells was not altered by 7,8-DHF. Our results suggest that 7,8-DHF can attenuate white matter pathology by mitigating axonal injury and oligodendrocyte death in the aged mouse brain following TBI. These data argue that further exploration of 7,8-DHF towards clinical use is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Proper maintenance of intracellular vesicular pH is essential for cargo trafficking during synaptic function and plasticity. Mutations in the SLC9A6 gene encoding the recycling endosomal pH regulator (Na+, K+)/H+ exchanger isoform 6 (NHE6) are causal for Christianson syndrome (CS), a severe form of X-linked intellectual disability. NHE6 expression is also downregulated in other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its dysfunction could contribute more broadly to the pathophysiology of other neurological conditions. To understand how ablation of NHE6 function leads to severe learning impairments, we assessed synaptic structure, function, and cellular mechanisms of learning in a novel line of Nhe6 knockout (KO) mice expressing a plasma membrane-tethered green fluorescent protein within hippocampal neurons. We uncovered significant reductions in dendritic spines density, AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression, and AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The neurons also failed to undergo functional and structural enhancement during long-term potentiation (LTP). Significantly, the selective TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone restored spine density as well as functional and structural LTP in KO neurons. TrkB activation thus may act as a potential clinical intervention to ameliorate cognitive deficits in CS and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "Enhancement of learning and memory by cognitive and physical exercise may be mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acting at tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Upregulation of BDNF and systemic administration of a TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), enhance learning of several hippocampus-sensitive tasks in rodents. Although BDNF and 7,8-DHF enhance functions of other brain areas too, these effects have mainly targeted non-cognitive functions. One goal of the present study was to determine whether 7,8-DHF would act beyond the hippocampus to enhance cognitive functions sensitive to manipulations of the striatum. Here, we examined the effects of intrastriatal infusions of 7,8-DHF on learning a striatum-sensitive response maze and on phosphorylation of TrkB receptors in 3-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats. Most prior studies of BDNF and 7,8-DHF effects on learning and memory have administered the drugs for days to months before assessing effects on cognition. A second goal of the present study was to determine whether a single drug treatment near the time of training would effectively enhance learning. Moreover, 7,8-DHF is often tested for its ability to reverse impairments in learning and memory rather than to enhance these functions in the absence of impairments. Thus, a third goal of this experiment was to evaluate the efficacy of 7,8-DHF in enhancing learning in unimpaired rats. In untrained rats, intrastriatal infusions of 7,8-DHF resulted in phosphorylation of TrkB receptors, suggesting that 7,8-DHF acted as a TrkB agonist and BDNF mimic. The findings that a single, intra-striatal infusion of 7,8-DHF 20 min before training enhanced response learning in rats suggest that, in addition to its trophic effects, BDNF modulates learning and memory through receptor mediated cell signaling events."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the role of physical activity in patients with of Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly regarding its impact of cognitive function, gut microbiota, metabolites, and neurotrophic factors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of multisensory fusion training (MSFT) combined with 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) on the behavioral characteristics, protein expression, microbiome, and serum metabolome using the AD model in mice induced with amyloid-β (Aβ). METHODS: We assessed cognitive ability, anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in Aβ mice using behavioral measures. Western blotting was employed to detect the expression of relevant proteins. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics were used to analyze changes in the intestinal microbial composition and serum metabolic profile, respectively, of Aβ mice. RESULTS: The behavioral outcomes indicated that a 4-week intervention combining DHF and MSFT yielded remarkable improvements in cognitive function and reduced anxiety and depression-like behaviors in Aβ mice. In the hippocampus of Aβ mice, the combined intervention increased the levels of BDNF, VGF, PSD-95, Nrf2, p-GSK3β and p-CREB proteins. Analyses of sequence and metabolomic data revealed that Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae were remarkably more abundant following the combined intervention, influencing the expression of specific metabolites directly linked to the maintenance of neuronal and neurobehavioral functions. These metabolites play a crucial role in vital processes, such as amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and neurotransmitter metabolism in mice. CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted that MSFT combined with DHF improves cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression-like behavior in Aβ mice through multiple mechanisms, and further validated the correlation between the gut microbiome and serum metabolome. These findings open up a promising avenue for future investigations into potential treatment strategies for AD."

Previous reports have shown that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a well-known TrkB agonist, effectively ameliorates cognitive deficits in several disease models. Therefore, this study investigated the protective effects of 7,8-DHF against 2-VO-induced VD. VD was established in rats using the permanent bilateral carotid arteries occlusion (two-vessel occlusion, 2-VO) model. 7,8-DHF (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) and Donepezil (10 mg/kg) were administered for 4 weeks. Memory function was assessed by the novel objective recognition task (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. Inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, and NF-kβ), oxidative stress, and apoptotic (BAX, BCL-2, caspase-3) markers, along with the activity of choline acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was assessed. p-AKT, p-CREB, BDNF, and neurotransmitter (NT) (GLU, GABA, and ACh) levels were also analyzed in the hippocampus of 2-VO rats. Our results show that 7,8-DHF effectively improved memory performance and cholinergic dysfunction in 2-VO model rats. Furthermore, 7,8-DHF treatment also increased p-AKT, p-CREB, and BDNF levels, suppressed oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers, and restored altered NT levels in the hippocampus. These findings imply that 7, 8-DHF may act via multiple mechanisms and as such serve as a promising neuroprotective agent in the context of VD.",

Drug-releasable scaffolds may provide reliable platforms to build a regenerative microenvironment for nerve recovery. In this study, an elastic hydrogel conduit encapsulating with prodrug nanoassemblies is fabricated by a continuous 3D printing technique for promoting nerve regeneration. The bioactive hydrogel is comprised of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and silk fibroin glycidyl methacrylate (SF-MA), exhibiting positive effects on adhesion, proliferation, and migration of Schwann cells. Meanwhile, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) prodrug nanoassemblies with high drug-loading capacities are developed through self-assembly of the lipophilic prodrug and loaded into the GelMA/SF-MA hydrogel. The drug loading conduit could sustainedly release 7,8-DHF to facilitate neurite elongation. A 12 ​mm nerve defect model is established for therapeutic efficiency evaluation by implanting the conduit through surgical suturing with rat sciatic nerve. The electrophysiological, morphological, and histological assessments indicate that this conduit can promote axon regeneration, remyelination, and function recovery by providing a favorable microenvironment. These findings implicate that the GelMA/SF-MA conduit with 7,8-DHF release has potentials in the treatment of long-gap peripheral nerve injury."

On day 28, the synaptic connections observed between C-terminal-binding protein 2-positive and postsynaptic density protein-95-positive puncta were restored, and caloric response was significantly improved in DHF (+) group (canal paresis: 57.4% in DHF (+) and 100% in DHF (-)). Taken together, the oral administration of DHF may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating vestibular dysfunction in humans."

      "abstract": "Obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance are mediated by macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. We investigated the effects of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a flavone found in plants, on the inflammatory response and insulin resistance induced by the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages. Hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cocultured with RAW 264.7 macrophages and treated with 7,8-DHF (3.12, 12.5, and 50 μM). The inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acid (FFA) release were evaluated by assay kits, and signaling pathways were determined by immunoblotting. Coculture of adipocytes and macrophages increased inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and FFA secretion but suppressed the production of anti-inflammatory adiponectin. 7,8-DHF counteracted the coculture-induced changes (p < 0.001). 7,8-DHF also inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and blocked nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation in the coculture system (p < 0.01). In addition, adipocytes cocultured with macrophages did not increase glucose uptake and Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin. However, 7,8-DHF treatment recovered the impaired responsiveness to insulin (p < 0.01). These findings show that 7,8-DHF alleviates inflammation and adipocyte dysfunction in the coculture of hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent for obesity-induced insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs in a very short time, the biological consequence of a TBI, such as Alzheimer's disease, may last a lifetime. To date, effective interventions are not available to improve recovery from a TBI. Herein we aimed to ascertain whether recovery of neurosurgical high-frequency irreversible electroporation (HFIRE) injury in brain tissues can be accelerated by 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF). METHODS: The HFIRE injury was induced in the right parietal cortex of 8 adult healthy and neurologically intact male dogs. Two weeks before HFIRE injury, each dog was administered orally with or without 7,8-DHF (30 mg/kg) once daily for consecutive 2 weeks (n = 4 for each group). The values of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, brain edema, and cerebral infarction volumes were measured. The concentrations of beta-amyloid, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured biochemically. RESULTS: The BBB disruption, brain edema, infarction volumes, and maximal cross-section area caused by HFIRE injury in canine brain were significantly attenuated by 7,8-DHF therapy (P < 0.0001). Additionally, 7,8-DHF significantly reduced the HFIRE-induced cerebral overproduction of beta-amyloid and proinflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (P < 0.0001) in dogs with HFIRE. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of neurosurgical HFIRE injury in canine brain tissues can be accelerated by 7,8-DHT via ameliorating BBB disruption as well as cerebral overproduction of both beta-amyloid and proinflammatory cytokines.",

      "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited form of intellectual disability and the most common cause of autism spectrum disorders. FXS patients exhibit severe syndromic features and behavioral alterations, including anxiety, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and aggression, in addition to cognitive impairment and seizures. At present, there are no effective treatments or cures for FXS. Previously, we have found the divergence of BDNF-TrkB signaling trajectories is associated with spine defects in early postnatal developmental stages of Fmr1 KO mice. Here, young fragile X mice were intraperitoneal injection with 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a high affinity tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist. 7,8-DHF ameliorated morphological abnormities in dendritic spine and synaptic structure and rescued synaptic and hippocampus-dependent cognitive dysfunction. These observed improvements of 7,8-DHF involved decreased protein levels of BDNF, p-TrkBY816, p-PLCγ, and p-CaMKII in the hippocampus. In addition, 7,8-DHF intervention in primary hippocampal neurons increased p-TrkBY816 and activated the PLCγ1-CaMKII signaling pathway, leading to improvement of neuronal morphology. This study is the first to account for early life synaptic impairments, neuronal morphological, and cognitive delays in FXS in response to the abnormal BDNF-TrkB pathway. Present studies provide novel evidences about the effective early intervention in FXS mice at developmental stages and a strategy to produce powerful impacts on neural development, synaptic plasticity, and behaviors.",

      "abstract": "From our previous observation that the anesthetic effects of phenobarbital potentiate in rats with a decreased cerebral protein expression of the potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2 (SLC12A5), an in vivo study was conducted to clarify whether the pharmacological effect of phenobarbital alters by stimulating the cerebral tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) that is known to down-regulate the KCC2 protein expression. The stimulation was performed in rats with repetitious intraperitoneal administration of a TrkB agonist, namely 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF). After that, the rats underwent an intraventricular infusion of phenobarbital using a dwelled cannula, and the onset time of the phenobarbital-induced general anesthesia was determined. In addition, their brain tissues were excised and cerebral cortices were collected. Then, subcellular fractions were prepared and the cerebral expression of various proteins involving the anesthetic effects of phenobarbital was examined. It was demonstrated that phenobarbital induced general anesthesia about 2 times faster in rats receiving the DHF treatment than in control rats, and that the phenobarbital amount in the brain tissue at the onset time of anesthesia was lower in rats with the treatment. Western blotting showed that the cerebral protein expression of KCC2 decreases, and the phosphorylation of the TrkB protein increases with the DHF treatment. These observations indicate that the anesthetic effects of phenobarbital potentiate with the TrkB stimulation and the resultant decrease in the cerebral KCC2 protein expression. The results also suggest that the TrkB protein and its phosphorylation status may be a key modulator of the pharmacological efficacy of phenobarbital.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a compensated response to various stimuli and is considered a key risk factor for heart failure. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a flavonoid derivative that acts as a small-molecule brain-derived neurotrophic factor mimetic. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of 7,8-DHF in cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS: Kunming mice and H9c2 cells were exposed to transverse aortic constriction or isoproterenol (ISO) with or without 7,8-DHF, respectively. F-actin staining was performed to calculate the cell area. Transcriptional levels of hypertrophic markers, including ANP, BNP, and β-MHC, were detected. Echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and transmission electron microscopy were used to examine the cardiac function, histology, and ultrastructure of ventricles. Protein levels of mitochondria-related factors, such as adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), were detected. RESULTS: 7,8-DHF inhibited compensated and decompensated cardiac hypertrophy, diminished the cross-sectional area, and alleviated the mitochondrial disorders of cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, 7,8-DHF reduced the cell size and repressed the mRNA levels of the hypertrophic markers of ISO-treated cardiomyocytes. In addition, 7,8-DHF activated AMPK and PGC-1α signals without affecting the protein levels of mitochondrial dynamics-related molecules. The effects of 7,8-DHF were eliminanted by Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 7,8-DHF inhibited cardiac hypertrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction by activating AMPK signaling, providing a potential agent for the treatment of pathological cardiac hypertrophy."

      "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) pathway is a therapeutic target in cardiac diseases. A BDNF mimetic, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), is emerging as a protective agent in cardiomyocytes; however, its potential role in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and fibrosis remains unknown. Thus, we aimed to explore the effects of 7,8-DHF on cardiac fibrosis and the possible mechanisms. Myocardial ischemia (MI) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were used to establish models of cardiac fibrosis. Hematoxylin & eosin and Masson's trichrome stains were used for histological analysis and determination of collagen content in mouse myocardium. Cell viability kit, EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) assay and immunofluorescent stain were employed to examine the effects of 7,8-DHF on the proliferation and collagen production of CFs. The levels of collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), TGF-β1, Smad2/3, and Akt as well as circadian rhythm-related signals including brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (Bmal1), period 2 (Per2), and cryptochrome 2 (Cry2) were analyzed. Treatment with 7,8-DHF markedly alleviated cardiac fibrosis in MI mice. It inhibited the activity of CFs accompanied by decreasing number of EdU-positive cells and downregulation of collagen I, α-SMA, TGF-β1, and phosphorylation of Smad2/3. 7,8-DHF significantly restored the dysregulation of Bmal1, Per2, and Cry2, but inhibited the overactive Akt. Further, inhibition of Bmal1 by SR9009 effectively attenuated CFs proliferation and collagen production of CFs. In summary, these findings indicate that 7,8-DHF attenuates cardiac fibrosis and regulates circadian rhythmic signals, at least partly, by inhibiting Bmal1/Akt pathway, which may provide new insights into therapeutic cardiac remodeling.",

However, no such preventive treatment is currently available. Aim of this study was to test an antioxidant agent, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), that is well tolerated and effective in preclinical models of many neurological disorders, as an anti-epileptogenic drug. However, 7,8-DHF also acts as a TrkB receptor agonist and, based on the literature, this effect may imply an anti- or a pro-epileptogenic effect. We found that low- (5 mg/kg), but not high-dose 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg) can exert strong anti-epileptogenic effects in the lithium-pilocarpine model (i.e., highly significant reduction in the frequency of spontaneous seizures and in the time to first seizure after status epilepticus). The mechanism of these different dose-related effects remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, considering its excellent safety profile and antioxidant properties, as well as its putative effects on TrkB receptors, 7,8-DHF represents an interesting template for the development of effective and well-tolerated anti-epileptogenic drugs.",

Since local BDNF delivery to the injured spinal cord enhanced diaphragmatic respiratory function, we aimed to ascertain whether DHF might have similar beneficial effects after Brown-Sequard Syndrome in a rat model of spinal cord lateral hemisection (HX) at the 9th thoracic (T9) vertebral level. METHODS: Three sets of adult female rats were included: sham+vehicle group, T9HX+vehicle group and T9HX+DHF group. On the day of surgery, HX+DHF group received DHF (5 mg/kg) while HX+vehicle group received vehicle. Neurobehavioral function, morphology of motor neurons innervating the tibialis anterior muscle and the transmission in descending motor pathways were evaluated. RESULTS: Adult female rats received T9 HX had paralysis and loss of proprioception on the same side as the injury and loss of pain and temperature on the opposite side. We found that, in this model of Brown-Sequard syndrome, reduced cord dendritic arbor complexity, reduced cord motoneuron numbers, enlarged cord lesion volumes, reduced motor evoked potentials, and cord astrogliosis and microgliosis were noted after T9HX. All of the above-mentioned disorders showed recovery by Day 28 after surgery. Therapy with DHF significantly accelerated the electrophysiological, histological and functional recovery in these T9HX animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a biological basis for DHF as a neurotherapeutic agent to improve recovery after a Brown-Sequard syndrome. Such an effect may be mediated by synaptic plasticity and glia-mediated inflammation in the spared lumbar motoneuron pools to a T9HX.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) is a naturally occurring flavonoid found in Godmania, Tridax, and Primula species that confers protection against high-fat diet (HFD) induced metabolic pathologies selectively in female mice. We have previously reported that this metabolic protection is associated with early and stable remodeling of the intestinal microbiome, evident in female but not male DHF-supplemented mice. Early changes in the gut microbiome in female DHF-fed mice were highly predictive of subsequent metabolic protection, suggesting a causative association between the gut microbiome and the metabolic effects of DHF. OBJECTIVE: To investigate a causal association between the gut microbiome and the metabolic effects of DHF using a model of antibiotic-induced gut microbiome ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age-matched male and female C57Bl6/J mice were given ad libitum access to HFD and drinking water containing vehicle or DHF for 12 weeks. For antibiotic (Abx) treatment, female mice were given drinking water containing a cocktail of antibiotics for 2 weeks prior to HFD feeding and throughout the feeding period. Metabolic phenotyping consisted of longitudinal assessments of body weights, body composition, food, and water intake, as well as measurement of energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and plasma and hepatic lipids. Protein markers mediating the cellular effects of DHF were assessed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and skeletal muscle. RESULTS: Metabolic protection conferred by DHF in female HFD-fed mice was only apparent in the presence of an intact gut microbiome. Abx-treated mice were not protected from HFD-induced obesity by DHF administration. Further, tissue activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) receptor, which has been attributed to the biological activity of DHF, was lost upon gut microbiome ablation, indicating a requirement for microbial \"activation\" of DHF for its systemic effects. In addition, we report for the first time that DHF supplementation significantly activates TrkB in BAT of female, but not male, mice uncovering a novel target tissue of DHF. DHF supplementation also increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein in BAT, consistent with protection from diet-induced obesity. CONCLUSION: These results establish for the first time a requirement for the gut microbiome in mediating the metabolic effects of DHF in female mice and uncover a novel target tissue that may mediate these sexually-dimorphic protective effects."

In this study, we investigated the effect of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) on ERS in liver and pancreas tissues in a cafeteria (CAF) diet induced metabolic syndrome model. MAIN METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed CAF diet for 16 weeks and 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg/day) for last four weeks. 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in liver and pancreas tissues, insulin and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in serum were analyzed by ELISA method and serum biochemistry parameters were analyzed with autoanalyzer. GRP78 and CHOP gene expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR. In addition, histopathological analyzes were performed on liver and pancreas tissues. KEY FINDINGS: Findings revealed that CAF diet caused metabolic abnormalities, insulin resistance and inflammation in serum and triggered ERS in pancreas and liver tissues. 7,8-DHF treatment significantly reduced metabolic abnormalities by reducing serum biochemical parameters, HOMO-IR and IL-1β levels. qRT-PCR and ELISA results indicated that 7,8-DHF treatment down-regulated GRP78 and CHOP expression and protein levels in the liver and GRP78 expression in pancreas. Efficiency of 7,8-DHF in these tissues was also demonstrated by histopathological tests. SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, CAF diet-induced metabolic syndrome model, 7,8-DHF suppressed ERS and ERS-induced metabolic disorders in both liver and pancreas. Therefore, 7,8-DHF may potentially be a novel therapeutic compound to ameliorate ERS and related metabolic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Glaucoma is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and excavation of the optic nerve head (ONH). It is associated with an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) and progressive decline in the visual field. Reduction in the retrograde axonal transport of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from the brain to the neuronal cell bodies in retina, has been suggested as one of the key mechanisms underlying selective degeneration of ganglion cells and optic nerve in glaucoma. Multiple studies have indicated that BDNF and its high affinity receptor Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) play crucial roles in survival of RGCs and that upregulating BDNF/TrkB signalling using gene therapy can protect the ganglion cells against degeneration. This study corroborates previous findings and demonstrates that glaucoma is associated with downregulation of TrkB downstream signalling and enhanced levels of amyloid β (Aβ 1-42) accumulation in the retina. 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (7,8 DHF) is a TrkB agonist and regular administration of this compound imparted significant protection against loss of GCL density and preserved inner retinal function in experimental glaucoma models. 7,8 DHF treatment stimulated activation of TrkB intracellular signalling as well as ameliorated the increase in the levels of soluble Aβ (1-42) in the retinas of rats and mice exposed to high IOP. The protective effects of 7,8 DHF were also evident in BDNF+/- mice indicating that TrkB agonist mediated activation of TrkB signalling was not altered upon BDNF allelic impairment. These data support BDNF/TrkB axis as a promising therapeutic target in glaucoma and highlight that the detrimental effects of high IOP exposure can be compensated by the exogenous administration of a TrkB agonist.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a selective agonist of tropomyosin related kinase receptor B (TrkB), is known to exert protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of 7,8-DHF in TrkB signaling after ischemic stroke has remained elusive. METHODS: In the vitro model of ischemic stroke, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of 7,8-DHF through activation of TrkB signaling. Neurons subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion were treated with the protein kinase inhibitor K252a and a knockdown of TrkB. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, Flow Cytometric Analysis (FACS), TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were conducted for measuring cell viability and numbers of apoptotic cells. And apoptosis-associated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Compared with the Control group, OGD/R group revealed lower cell viability by CCK-8 assay FACS and TUNEL assay showed increased rates of neuronal apoptosis. However, 7,8-DHF treatment increased cell viability and reduced neuronal apoptosis. Western blotting indicated upregulated Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and but downregulated Bcl-2 following OGD/R. Whereas 7,8-DHF treatment downregulated Bax and cleaved caspase-3 but upregulated Bcl-2. These changes were accompanied by a significant increase in the phosphorylation of TrkB and Akt following 7,8-DHF administration. However, the administration of K252a and knockdown of TrkB could alleviate those effects. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that activation of TrkB signaling by 7,8-DHF protects neurons against OGD/R injury via the TrkB/Akt pathway, which provides the evidence for the role of TrkB signaling in OGD-induced neuronal damage and may become a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS), a major genetic cause of intellectual disability, is characterized by numerous neurodevelopmental defects. Previous in vitro studies highlighted a relationship between bioenergetic dysfunction and reduced neurogenesis in progenitor cells from the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS, suggesting a critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodevelopmental alterations in DS. Recent in vivo studies in Ts65Dn mice showed that neonatal supplementation (Days P3-P15) with the polyphenol 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) fully restored hippocampal neurogenesis. The current study was aimed to establish whether brain mitochondrial bioenergetic defects are already present in Ts65Dn pups and whether early treatment with 7,8-DHF positively impacts on mitochondrial function. In the brain and cerebellum of P3 and P15 Ts65Dn pups we found a strong impairment in the oxidative phosphorylation apparatus, resulting in a deficit in mitochondrial ATP production and ATP content. Administration of 7,8-DHF (dose: 5 mg/kg/day) during Days P3-P15 fully restored bioenergetic dysfunction in Ts65Dn mice, reduced the levels of oxygen radicals and reinstated the hippocampal levels of PGC-1α. No pharmacotherapy is available for DS. From current findings, 7,8-DHF emerges as a treatment with a good translational potential for improving mitochondrial bioenergetics and, thus, mitochondria-linked neurodevelopmental alterations in DS."

      "abstract": "Astrocytic functions and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) signaling pathways are impaired in stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. Previous studies have reported neuroprotective effects of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a TrkB activator. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using a modified single-prolonged stress (SPS&S) model and the potential beneficial effects of 7,8-DHF. SPS&S reduced the hippocampal expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes, and induced morphological changes in astrocytes. From the perspective of synaptic function, the SPS&S model displayed reduced expression of BDNF, p-TrkB, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (GluA1), NMDA receptor subunit N2A/N2B ratio, calpain-1, phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and conversely, higher phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) expression in the hippocampus. Acute or continuous intraperitoneal administration of 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg) after SPS&S procedures prevented SPS&S-induced fear memory generalization and anxiety-like behaviors as well as abnormalities of hippocampal oscillations. Most importantly, 7,8-DHF attenuated SPS&S-induced abnormal BDNF-TrkB signaling and calpain-1-dependent cascade of synaptic deficits. Furthermore, treatment with a TrkB inhibitor completely blocked while an mTOR inhibitor partially blocked the effects of 7,8-DHF on behavioral changes of SPS&S model mice. Our collective findings suggest that 7,8-DHF effectively alleviates PTSD-like symptoms, including fear generalization and anxiety-like behavior, potentially by preventing astrocytic and synaptic deficits in the hippocampus through targeting of TrkB.",

      "abstract": "The combined antiretroviral therapy era has significantly increased the lifespan of people with HIV (PWH), turning a fatal disease to a chronic one. However, this lower but persistent level of HIV infection increases the susceptibility of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Therefore, research is currently seeking improved treatment for this complication of HIV. In PWH, low levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been associated with worse neurocognitive impairment. Hence, BDNF administration has been gaining relevance as a possible adjunct therapy for HAND. However, systemic administration of BDNF is impractical because of poor pharmacological profile. Therefore, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of BDNF-mimicking 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a bioactive high-affinity TrkB agonist, in the memory-involved hippocampus and brain cortex of Tg26 mice, a murine model for HAND. In these brain regions, we observed astrogliosis, increased expression of chemokine HIV-1 coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial damage. Hippocampi and cortices of DHF treated mice exhibited a reversal of these pathological changes, suggesting the therapeutic potential of DHF in HAND. Moreover, our data indicates that DHF increases the phosphorylation of TrkB, providing new insights about the role of the TrkB-Akt-NFkB signaling pathway in mediating these pathological hallmarks. These findings guide future research as DHF shows promise as a TrkB agonist treatment for HAND patients in adjunction to the current antiviral therapies.",

METHODS: Mice received unilateral closed mid-shaft tibial fractures and treated for two weeks with vehicle or 5 mg/kg/day DHF and euthanised at 28 days post-fracture. Calluses were analysed by micro-computed tomography (μCT) and three-point bending biomechanical test. Kusa4b10 cells were cultured with 50nM of 7,8-DHF or vehicle for 3-, 7-, 14-days for RT-PCR, and 21 days for mineralization. RESULTS: μCT found 7,8-DHF calluses had decreased tissue volume (p=0.042), mean polar moment of inertia (p = 0.004), and mean cross-sectional area (p=0.042) compared to controls. At 28 days biomechanical analyses showed 7,8-DHF treatment decreased peak force (p=0.011) and stiffness per unit area (p=0.012). 7,8-DHF treatment did not change Kusa4b10 gene expression of Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase at all time points, nor mineralization. CONCLUSIONS: 7,8-DHF treatment had a negative impact on fracture healing at 28 days post-fracture via an unknown mechanism. 7,8-DHF may have had a central role in impairing fracture healing.",

This study was designed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of 7,8-DHF that may influence OS development. Human OS cell lines (U2OS and 143B) were treated with 7,8-DHF; cell viability and cell migration were assessed by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and wound-healing assay, respectively; and cell death and apoptosis were evaluated by LIVE/DEAD staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. Reactive oxygen species production was measured using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate probe. Akt, Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 asociated death promoter (Bad), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) expression and their respective phosphorylation levels were detected by western blot analysis. We found that 7,8-DHF reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and also promoted apoptosis, inhibited migration, and induced oxidative stress in OS cells. Moreover, 7,8-DHF inhibited Akt, Bad, and p38MAPK, but activated ERK and JNK signals. In summary, our results suggest that 7,8-DHF inhibits OS progression, possibly by regulating Akt/Bad and MAPK signaling. These findings provide new evidence for the pharmacological effects of 7,8-DHF that may improve drug therapy for OS patients.",

Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a widely used neurodevelopmental animal model for schizophrenia but it is unclear if BDNF and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), are involved in PPI regulation in this model. Pregnant Long Evans rats were treated with the viral mimetic, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C; 4 mg/kg i.v.), and nine male offspring from these dams were compared in adulthood to 11 male Long Evans controls. Offspring underwent PPI testing following injection with the TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) (10 mg/kg i.p.), with or without the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO; 1 mg/kg s.c.), or the dopamine releasing drug, methamphetamine (METH; 2 mg/kg s.c.). Acute administration of APO and METH caused the expected significant reduction of PPI. Acute administration of 7,8-DHF did not alter PPI on its own; however, it significantly reversed the effect of APO on PPI in poly I:C rats, but not in controls. A similar trend was observed in combination with METH. Western blot analysis of frontal cortex revealed significantly increased levels of BDNF protein, but not TrkB or phosphorylated TrkB/TrkB levels, in poly I:C rats. These findings suggest that, selectively in MIA offspring, 7,8-DHF has the ability to reverse PPI deficits caused by dopaminergic stimulation. This effect could be associated with increased BDNF expression in the frontal cortex. These data suggest that targeting BDNF signalling may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of certain symptoms of schizophrenia.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the neuroprotective and cognitive enhancement properties of 7,8-DHF in an ICV-STZ rat model of SAD. METHODS: ICV-STZ (3 mg/kg) was injected into male Wistar rats. Cognitive functions were evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR). 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg) and rivastigmine (2 mg/kg) were given orally for 21 days. Reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonylation (PCO), and nitrite assays were performed. Mitochondrial enzyme complex I, II, III, and IV, and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activities were determined. ELISA for the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and p-tau was done. Histopathology was investigated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS: 7,8-DHF treatment attenuated ICV-STZ-induced cognitive deficit in MWM and NOR. Moreover, in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the brain, GSH, catalase, SOD, GPX, LPO, PCO, and nitrite levels were reversed. Mitochondrial enzyme complex I, II, III, and IV, and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activities were also normalized. IDE and p-tau protein were found to be significantly altered. 7,8-DHF provided protection from neuronal cell death examined in histopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, 7,8-DHF was found to be neuroprotective in the ICV-STZ rat model by ameliorating oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance, thereby improving cognitive functions evident with the behavioral results.",

      "abstract": "Synaptic impairment may be the main cause of cognitive dysfunction in brain aging that is probably due to a reduction in synaptic contact between the axonal buttons and dendritic spines. Rho proteins including the small GTPase Rac1 have become key regulators of neuronal morphogenesis that supports synaptic plasticity. Small Rho- and Ras-GTPases are post-translationally modified by the isoprenoids geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), respectively. For all GTPases, anchoring in the plasma membrane is essential for their activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Rac1-specific GEFs include the protein T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1). Tiam1 interacts with the TrkB receptor to mediate the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced activation of Rac1, resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangement and changes in cellular morphology. The flavonoid 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) acts as a highly affine-selective TrkB receptor agonist and causes the dimerization and autophosphorylation of the TrkB receptor and thus the activation of downstream signaling pathways. In the current study, we investigated the effects of 7,8-DHF on cerebral lipid isoprenoid and Rho protein levels in male C57BL/6 mice aged 3 and 23 months. Aged mice were daily treated with 100 mg/kg b.w. 7,8-DHF by oral gavage for 21 days. FPP, GGPP, and cholesterol levels were determined in brain tissue. In the same tissue, the protein content of Tiam1 and TrkB in was measured. The cellular localization of the small Rho-GTPase Rac1 and small Rab-GTPase Rab3A was studied in total brain homogenates and membrane preparations. We report the novel finding that 7,8-DHF restored levels of the Rho proteins Rac1 and Rab3A in membrane preparations isolated from brains of treated aged mice. The selective TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF did not affect BDNF and TrkB levels, but restored Tiam1 levels that were found to be reduced in brains of aged mice. FPP, GGPP, and cholesterol levels were significantly elevated in brains of aged mice but not changed by 7,8-DHF treatment. Hence, 7,8-DHF may be useful as pharmacological tool to treat age-related cognitive dysfunction although the underlying mechanisms need to be elucidated in detail.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a well-known oncogene, and the discovery of ODC enzyme inhibitors is a beneficial strategy for cancer therapy and prevention. METHODS: We examined the inhibitory effects of a variety of flavone and flavonol derivatives on ODC enzymatic activity, and performed in silico molecular docking of baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and myricetin to the whole dimer of human ODC to investigate the possible binding site of these compounds on ODC. We also examined the cytotoxic effects of these compounds with cell-based studies. RESULTS: Baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and myricetin exhibited significant ODC suppression activity with IC50 values of 0.88 µM, 2.54 µM, and 7.3 µM, respectively, which were much lower than that of the active-site irreversible inhibitor α-DL-difluoromethylornithine (IC50, the half maximal inhibitory concentration, of approximately 100 µM). Kinetic studies and molecular docking simulations suggested that baicalein, and 7,8-dihydroxyflavone act as noncompetitive inhibitors that are hydrogen-bonded to the region near the active site pocket in the dimer interface of the enzyme. Baicalein and myricetin suppress cell growth and induce cellular apoptosis, and both of these compounds suppress the ODC-evoked anti-apoptosis of cells. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we suggest that the flavone or flavonol derivatives baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, and myricetin are potent chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents that target ODC.",

Among them, the BDNF mimetic 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is emerging as a potential treatment for a constellation of brain and body pathologies. During the past 10 years, more than 180 preclinical studies have explored the efficacy of 7,8-DHF in animal models of different pathologies. The current review intends to be an exhaustive survey of these studies. By providing detailed information on the rationale of the experimental design and outcome of treatment, we will give the reader tools to critically interpret the achievement obtained so far. If we put together each individual piece of this complex mosaic, a picture emerges that is full of promise regarding the potential usefulness of 7,8-DHF for human treatment. Much has been done so far and we believe that the time is now ripe to move from the bench to the bedside, in order to establish whether supplementation with 7,8-DHF may serve as therapy or, at least, as adjuvant for the treatment of pathologies affecting brain and body functioning.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a detrimental disease that develops through chronic ethanol exposure. Reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression has been associated with AUD and alcohol addiction, however the effects of activation of BDNF signalling in the brain on voluntary alcohol intake reinstatement and relapse are unknown. We therefore trained male and female Sprague Dawley rats in operant chambers to self-administer a 10% ethanol solution. Following baseline acquisition and progressive ratio (PR) analysis, rats were split into drug and vehicle groups during alcohol lever extinction. The animals received two weeks of daily IP injection of either the BDNF receptor, TrkB, agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), or vehicle. During acquisition of alcohol self-administration, males had significantly higher absolute numbers of alcohol-paired lever presses and a higher PR breakpoint. However, after adjusting for body weight, the amount of ethanol was not different between the sexes and the PR breakpoint was higher in females than males. Following extinction, alcohol-primed reinstatement in male rats was not altered by pretreatment with 7,8-DHF when adjusted for body weight. In contrast, in female rats, the weight-adjusted potential amount of ethanol, but not absolute numbers of active lever presses, was significantly enhanced by 7,8-DHF treatment during reinstatement. Analysis of spontaneous locomotor activity in automated photocell cages suggested that the effect of 7,8-DHF was not associated with hyperactivity. These results suggest that stimulation of the TrkB receptor may contribute to reward craving and relapse in AUD, particularly in females."

      "abstract": "Fluoxetine (FLX) has been considered as an effective anti-depressant drug. Besides, previous studies reported reasonable anti-depressant effects for 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone (7, 8 DHF). However, the combination of FLX and 7, 8 DHF in a well-established depression model has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrate that the 7, 8 DHF can improve the anti-depressant efficacy of FLX in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression during the perimenopausal period. The corresponding mechanism of FLX+7, 8 DHF therapy and the effect of ANA-12 are also investigated. Moreover, the influences of 7, 8 DHF (5 mg/kg/day), FLX (18 mg/kg/day), and ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg/day) on a depressive-like behavior are displayed. Inflammatory, autophagic and apoptotic changes of hippocampus and cortex are examined by using western blot, immunofluorescence, and Real-Time Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) techniques. The protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (p-ErK 1/2)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) of hippocampus and cortex are assessed by western blot. The combined FLX and 7, 8 DHF treatment can significantly improve depressive-like behavior in sucrose preference and forced swimming tests accompanied by a noticeable upregulation of autophagy, neuronal nuclei (NeuN), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) expressions, and PI3K/Akt/ mTOR/ p-ErK 1/2 signaling pathways. Besides, an obvious increase of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB levels are observed with down-regulated inflammation and apoptosis. These findings suggest that the integrated FLX and 7, 8 DHF holds a potential as an efficient treatment to ameliorate depressive-like behavior in perimenopausal patients.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Alcoholism and obesity impart a deleterious impact on human health and affects the quality of life. Chronic consumption of alcohol and western diet has been reported to cause memory deficits. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a TrkB agonist, comprises antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in treating various neurological disorders. OBJECTIVES: The current study was aimed to determine the protective effect and molecular mechanism of 7,8-DHF against alcohol and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced memory deficits in rats. METHODS: The adult male Wistar rats were given alcohol (3-15%) and HFD ad libitum for 12 weeks in different experimental groups. 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected daily for the last 4 weeks (9th-12th week). RESULTS: The alcohol and HFD administration caused cognitive impairment as evaluated through the Morris water maze (MWM) test in alcohol, HFD, and alcohol + HFD-fed animals. The last 4-week treatment of 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg; i.p.) attenuated alcohol and HFD-induced memory loss. 7,8-DHF treatment also restored the glutathione (GSH) level along with attenuation of nitrite, malondialdehyde content (markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress), and reduction of the acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus of alcohol and HFD-fed animals. Furthermore, the administration of 7,8-DHF caused downregulation of NF-κB, iNOS, and caspase-3 and upregulation of Nrf2, HO-1, and BDNF mRNA level in rat hippocampus. CONCLUSION: 7,8-DHF administration conferred beneficial effects against alcohol and HFD-induced memory deficit via its unique antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic potential, along with the activation of TrkB/BDNF signaling pathway in the hippocampus.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by neurodegeneration of nigrostriatal neurons, resulting in dopamine (DA) stimulated motor deficits. Like brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) is an agonist of the tropomyosin receptor kinase-B (TrkB) and stimulates the same secondary cascades that promote neuronal growth, survival and differentiation. We used our progressive mouse model of PD by administering increasing doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) over 4 weeks (5 days/week), and then treated mice with DHF for 4 weeks after the cessation of the toxin injections (i.e., restoration). Mice treated with DHF recovered motorically, even after MPTP administration. Despite a 75% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the dorsolateral (DL) striatum in the MPTP group, mice treated with DHF had a recovery comparable to that found in the respective control. There was no recovery of DA tissue levels within the DL striatum. In both the DL striatum and substantia nigra (SN)/midbrain, phosphorylated TrkB and secondary messengers were significantly increased following DHF compared to the MPTP only group. Expression of the sprouting biomarker, superior cervical ganglion 10 (SCG10), was increased ∼20% in the DL striatum and 66% in the SN/midbrain in mice treated with DHF compared to the MPTP only group. We report that after 4 weeks of progressive MPTP administration, DHF can restore motor deficits and TH within the DL striatum in a TrkB-dependent manner. Our data suggests that DHF may help alleviate motor symptoms of PD and restore the loss of DA terminals within the striatum.",

Recently, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) has been identiﬁed as a selective TrkB agonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier after oral or intraperitoneal administration, and it enhances cued fear extinction in male rodents. However, its effects on females remain unclear. Preclinical research including both sexes is important for the development of treatment, particularly, for stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder because such disorders are more prevalent in women. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 7,8-DHF on cued and contextual fear extinction in both male and female mice. Here we demonstrated that the administration of 7,8-DHF before each extinction session attenuated cued fear extinction in females; conversely, it enhanced cued fear extinction in males. However, administration of 7,8-DHF immediately after each extinction session did not affect cued fear extinction in either sex. Moreover, in contextual fear extinction, administration of 7,8-DHF before each extinction session did not affect fear extinction in either sex. Thus, 7,8-DHF showed sex-dependent opposite effects on cued fear extinction in mice when administered before but not immediately after each extinction session. Our results could contribute to the development of pharmacotherapy involving 7,8-DHF, particularly for stress-related disorders.",

Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of DHF on cytochrome P450 (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) and xanthine oxidase (XO) enzymes were also tested using in vitro models. Our results demonstrate that DHF forms a stable complex with albumin (K = 4.9 × 105 L/mol) and that it is able to displace both Site I and Site II ligands. Moreover, DHF proved to be a potent inhibitor of each enzyme tested, showing similar or slightly weaker effects than the positive controls used.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatty liver diseases are the most common and major health concern arises from the modern lifestyle and alcohol (ethanol) abuse. The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) has been observed prominently in obese and diabetic individuals, while alcoholic liver disease is common in alcoholic persons. Fatty liver disease, such as steatohepatitis, leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) against high-fat diet (HFD) and ethanol (EtOH)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were fed HFD (58% calories from fat) and EtOH (3-15% in drinking water) for 12 weeks. 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day for the last four weeks. After 12 weeks, biochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and histological studies have been carried out. RESULTS: Biochemical analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver of HFD and EtOH-fed rats. 7,8-DHF treatment significantly reduced HFD and EtOH-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by the reduction of lipid peroxidation and augmentation of reduced glutathione level. Moreover, IL-1β level was found significantly reduced in 7,8-DHF treated EtOH, HFD and EtOH+HFD groups. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR results indicated down-regulation of Nrf-2 and HO-1 and up-regulation of NF-κB and iNOS mRNA expression level in the liver of HFD and EtOH-fed rats, which was ameliorated by 7,8-DHF treatment. CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that 7,8-DHF could be an effective pharmacological intervention in combating HFD and EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) against osteoarthritis (OA) and examine its regulatory role in the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in chondrocytes. Primary mouse chondrocytes were treated with 7,8-DHF to examine the expression of Nrf2 and downstream heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). The surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus model was used to assess the effectiveness of 7,8-DHF in protecting the cartilage from damage, with knee cartilage harvested from mice for histological analysis. The results revealed that 7,8-DHF activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway in primary chondrocytes. Cartilage degradation in the 7,8-DHF-treated group was reduced significantly compared with that in the vehicle-treated group, according to histological evaluation. The gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1, MMP3, MMP13, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α were reduced in the cartilage of OA mice following 7,8-DHF treatment. Genetic and protein analyses indicated that the expression levels of HO-1 were upregulated in the cartilage of the knee with OA, and 7,8-DHF treatment further promoted the induction of HO-1. These results suggest that 7,8-DHF may serve as a potential therapeutic agent in OA."

The major purpose of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of 7,8-DHF on the rotenone-induced motor deficit of Parkinson's disease. Nine-month-old rats were treated with rotenone (2 mg/kg/day, i.h.) for 5 weeks to establish the animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated daily throughout the whole period of rotenone injection. Five weeks later, an open field test was used to assess the motor ability of the animals. TH immunostaining was performed to evaluate rotenone-induced neurotoxicity on substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neurons and the DA terminals in the striatum. Western blot analyses were used to examine the expressions of TH, BDNF/TrkB signaling cascades, phospho-α-synuclein (Ser129), α-synuclein, and phospho-tau (Ser396) in SN. The results revealed that treatment with 7,8-DHF improved PD model's behavioral performance and reduced dopaminergic neuron loss in the SN and striatum, associated with the activation of TrkB receptors and its signaling cascades, and reduced p-MAPK, p-α-synuclein, and p-tau. Collectively, these results indicated that 7,8-DHF displayed prominent neuroprotective properties, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for PD treatment."

As its powerful potential to modulate neuronal functions, TrkB pathway is an attractive target for novel drugs and treatment of common neurological disorders. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a TrkB receptor agonist, has similar properties with neurotrophin Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF). DHF is reported to have a number of beneficial effects in neuroprotection, against depression and improving learning and memory. However, the outcome of acute application of DHF on the excitability of neuronal circuits is not clear. Especially the effects of DHF on synchronized epileptiform activity are not known. In this study, we investigated whether DHF induces epileptiform activity in brain slices and DHF has any effect on already initiated epileptiform discharges. We used acute horizontal hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices obtained from 30 to 35 days of mice. Extracellular field potential recordings were obtained from entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus CA1 region. DHF did not initiate any epileptiform activity or abnormal discharges. However, DHF increased the frequency of 4 aminopyridine (4AP) induced ictal and interictal events in both EC and CA1. The duration of induced ictal charges were also prolonged upon DHF application. In a number of slices, both EC and CA1, DHF led to ictogenesis. These results suggest that the acute activation of TrkB by DHF has a powerful potential on synchronized neuronal discharges which should be considered in future therapeutical approaches.",

Diabetic neuropathy, which is the most frequent complications of diabetes, affect sensory, motor, and autonomic nerves. This study aimed to investigate whether 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) protects SH-SY5Y neuronal cells against high glucose-induced toxicity. In the current study, we found that diabetic patients exhibited higher lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative stress than healthy subjects. 7,8-DHF exhibits superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities. High glucose-induced toxicity severely damaged SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, causing mitochondrial depolarization; however, 7,8-DHF recovered mitochondrial polarization. Furthermore, 7,8-DHF effectively modulated the expression of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) and anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) under high glucose, thus inhibiting the activation of caspase signaling pathways. These results indicate that 7,8-DHF has antioxidant effects and protects cells from apoptotic cell death induced by high glucose. Thus, 7,8-DHF may be developed into a promising candidate for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy."

Recently, small-molecule TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) has received considerable attention as a novel potential candidate for the treatment of various BDNF-implicated human disorders. However, its roles in cardiac diseases are not fully understood. Here, the present study aimed to clarify the effects and mechanisms of 7,8-DHF on doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiotoxicity. Kunming mice and H9c2 cells were employed to investigate the functional role of 7,8-DHF both in vivo and in vitro. 7,8-DHF markedly increased cell viability and reduced cell death of Dox-treated cells. Meanwhile, 7,8-DHF significantly increased mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) protein expression. 7,8-DHF improved cardiac function and attenuated cardiac injury in Dox mice model. Expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) was restored by 7,8-DHF. Furthermore, the protective role of 7,8-DHF was abolished by ANA-12 (a specific antagonist of TrkB). In elucidating the molecular mechanism, the phosphorylation of Akt was significantly increased while extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) was decreased after 7,8-DHF treatment. The regulatory effects of 7,8-DHF on STAT3 and AMPK was reversed by Akt inhibitor. In summary, 7,8-DHF attenuated Dox-induced cardiotoxicity by activating Akt and increasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and thereby regulating STAT3, AMPK, and ERK signals. The present study enhanced current understanding of TrkB receptor in the cardiovascular system and provided a novel target for prevention and treatment of heart diseases.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury causes significant damages in the immature retina. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor is well known for its neuroprotective role but has limited clinical applications. A selective agonist of tyrosine kinase receptor B, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), is a powerful therapeutic tool, when administered systemically. However, it remains unclear whether DHF treatment can protect the immature retinas against HI injury. METHODS: Postnatal (P) day 7 rat pups were intraperitoneally injected with DHF or vehicle 2 hours before and 18 hours after being subjected to HI injury. The outcomes were assessed at various timepoints after injury by electroretinography and histologic examinations. Neurogenesis was assessed by double-labeling of retinal sections with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and different neuronal markers. RESULTS: At P8, 24-hours postinjury, brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels in the retina decreased significantly. DHF treatment partially protected immature retinas at both histologic and functional levels between P14 and P30 but did not prevent apoptosis, inflammation, or damage of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) at P8. On the other hand, DHF treatment promoted the survival of proliferating inner retinal cells, including Müller glia, and enhanced their transdifferentiation to bipolar cells at P17. Moreover, DHF treatment rescued the levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, which were significantly decreased after injury. The neuroprotective effects of DHF were markedly eliminated by inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Early systemic DHF treatment has neuroprotective effects against HI injury in immature retinas, possibly via promoting neurogenesis through the tyrosine kinase receptor B/ERK signaling pathway.

      "abstract": "Although 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a synthetic agonist specific for tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), has been reported to promote intestinal dynamics, its effect on gastric dynamics has not been studied as yet. In this study, we explored how 7,8-DHF affected the carbachol (CCh)-induced contraction of rat gastric muscle by way of measuring the contractile tension of muscular strips. We found that although 7,8-DHF did not directly cause contraction of gastric muscle, it enhanced CCh-induced, instead of substance P- or high K+ -induced, contraction. The enhancing role of 7,8-DHF was partially blocked by ANA-12, a blocker specific for TrkB the activation of which in the gastric strips was evidenced by its phosphorylation. Although 7,8-DHF alone did not activate : phospholipase C (PLC)-γ in gastric muscle, CCh did, and importantly, the combined treatment with CCh + 7,8-DHF activated more PLC-γ. U73122, an antagonist to PLC-γ blocked both the CCh-induced and the 7,8-DHF-enhanced/CCh-induced contraction by ~30%. To pursue how 7,8-DHF could augment CCh-activated PLC-γ phosphorylation, we first examined the effect of 7,8-DHF on the expression of muscarinic receptors in gastric muscle and found that 7,8-DHF specifically increased M3 but not M2 receptor expression possibly through TrkB/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway because the Akt antagonist, LY294002 significantly suppressed the 7,8-DHF-augmemted M3 expression and completely blocked the 7,8-DHF-enhanced cholinergic contraction. Supporting the result, Akt phosphorylation in the gastric muscle was enhanced by 7,8-DHF treatment. The in vivo experiment showed that orally fed 7,8-DHF increased gastric emptying rate. The results imply a possibility that 7,8-DHF may be developed into a drug in the future for enhancing gastric dynamics.",

BDNF signaling through the TrkB receptor has a central role in promoting synaptic transmission, synaptogenesis, and facilitating synaptic plasticity making the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway an attractive candidate for targeted therapies. Here we investigated the early effect of the small molecule TrkB agonist, 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), on AD-related pathology, dendritic arborization, synaptic density, and neurochemical changes in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. We treated 5xFAD mice with 7,8-DHF for 2 months beginning at 1 month of age. We found that, in this model of AD, 7,8-DHF treatment decreased cortical Aβ plaque deposition and protected cortical neurons against reduced dendritic arbor complexity but had no significant impact on the density of dendritic spines. In addition 7,8-DHF treatment protected against hippocampal increase in the level of choline-containing compounds and glutamate loss, but had no significant impact on hippocampal neurogenesis.",

Alterations in TrkB expression have been described in different CNS disorders. Therefore, drugs interacting with TrkB, specially agonists, are promising therapeutic tools. Among them, the recently described 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), an orally bioactive compound, has been successfully tested in animal models of these diseases. Recent studies have shown the influence of this drug on the structure of pyramidal neurons, specifically on dendritic spine density. However, there is no information yet on how DHF may alter the structural dynamics of these neurons (i.e., real-time study of the addition/elimination of dendritic spines and axonal boutons). To gain knowledge on these effects of DHF, we have performed a real-time analysis of spine and axonal dynamics in pyramidal neurons of barrel cortex, using cranial windows and 2-photon microscopy during a chronic oral treatment with this drug. After confirming TrkB expression in these neurons, we found that DHF increased the gain rates of spines and axonal boutons, as well as improved object recognition memory. These results help to understand how the activation of the BDNF-TrkB system can improve basic behavioral tasks through changes in the structural dynamics of pyramidal neurons. Moreover, they highlight DHF as a promising therapeutic vector for certain brain disorders in which this system is altered.",

      "abstract": "Childhood lead (Pb2+) intoxication is a public health problem of global proportion. Lead exposure during development produces multiple effects on the central nervous system including impaired synapse formation, altered synaptic plasticity, and learning deficits. In primary hippocampal neurons in culture and hippocampal slices, Pb2+ exposure inhibits vesicular release and reduces the number of fast-releasing sites, an effect associated with Pb2+ inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated trans-synaptic Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) signaling. The objective of this study was to determine if activation of TrkB, the cognate receptor for BDNF, would rescue Pb2+-induced impairments of vesicular release. Rats were chronically exposed to Pb2+ prenatally and postnatally until 50 days of age. This chronic Pb2+ exposure paradigm enhanced paired-pulse facilitation of synaptic potentials in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus, a phenomenon indicative of reduced vesicular release probability. Decreased vesicular release probability was confirmed by both mean-variance analysis and direct 2-photon imaging of vesicular release from hippocampal slices of rats exposed to Pb2+in vivo. We also found a Pb2+-induced impairment of calcium influx in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synaptic terminals. Intraperitoneal injections of Pb2+ rats with the TrkB receptor agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (5 mg/kg) for 14-15 days starting at postnatal day 35, reversed all Pb2+-induced impairments of presynaptic transmitter release at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo pharmacological activation of TrkB receptors by small molecules such as 7,8-dihydroxyflavone can reverse long-term effects of chronic Pb2+ exposure on presynaptic terminals, pointing to TrkB receptor activation as a promising therapeutic intervention in Pb2+-intoxicated children.",

      "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with motor, cognitive and psychiatric impairment. Dysfunctions in HD models have been related to reduced levels of striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and imbalance between its receptors TrkB and p75(NTR). Thus, molecules with activity on the BDNF/TrkB/p75 system can have therapeutic potential. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) was described as a TrkB agonist in several models of neuro-degenerative diseases, however, its TrkB activation profile needs further investigation due to its pleiotropic properties and divergence from BDNF effect. To investigate this, we used in vitro and in vivo models of HD to dissect TrkB activation upon 7,8-DHF treatment. 7,8-DHF treatment in primary cultures showed phosphorylation of TrkBY816 but not TrkBY515 with activation of the PLCγ1 pathway leading to morphological and functional improvements. Chronic administration of 7,8-DHF delayed motor deficits in R6/1 mice and reversed deficits on the Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT) at 17 weeks. Morphological and biochemical analyses revealed improved striatal levels of enkephalin, and prevention of striatal volume loss. We found a TrkBY816 but not TrkBY515 phosphorylation recovery in striatum concordant with in vitro results. Additionally, 7,8-DHF normalized striatal levels of induced and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (iNOS and nNOS, respectively) and ameliorated the imbalance of p75/TrkB. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of action of 7,8-DHF suggesting that its effect through the TrkB receptor in striatum is via selective phosphorylation of its Y816 residue and activation of PLCγ1 pathway, but pleiotropic effects of the drug also contribute to its therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction accompanying traumatic brain injury (TBI) severely impairs the ability of injured neurons to comply with functional demands. This limits the success of rehabilitative strategies by compromising brain plasticity and function, and highlights the need for early interventions to promote energy homeostasis. We sought to examine whether the TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) normalizes brain energy deficits and reestablishes more normal patterns of functional connectivity, while enhancing the effects of exercise during post-TBI period. Moderate fluid percussion injury (FPI) was performed and 7,8-DHF (5mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in animals subjected to FPI that either had access to voluntary wheel running for 7days after injury or were sedentary. Compared to sham-injured controls, TBI resulted in reduced hippocampal activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB and associated CREB, reduced levels of plasticity markers GAP-43 and Syn I, as well as impaired memory as indicated by the Barnes maze task. While 7,8-DHF treatment and exercise individually mitigated TBI-induced effects, administration of 7,8-DHF concurrently with exercise facilitated memory performance and augmented levels of markers of cell energy metabolism viz., PGC-1α, COII and AMPK. In parallel to these findings, resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) acquired at 2weeks after injury showed that 7,8-DHF with exercise enhanced hippocampal functional connectivity, and suggests 7,8-DHF and exercise to promote increases in functional connectivity. Together, these findings indicate that post-injury 7,8-DHF treatment promotes enhanced levels of cell metabolism, synaptic plasticity in combination with exercise increases in brain circuit function that facilitates greater physical rehabilitation after TBI.",

The objective of this paper is to study the role of complement protein C1q in the psychosis of adult offspring after maternal immune activation (MIA). In addition, effect of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF: a tropomyosin receptor kinase B [TrkB] agonist) was also examined. METHODS: Western blot analysis of C1q in the brain regions from adult offspring after prenatal poly(I:C) (5.0 mg/kg/day from E12 to E17) exposure was performed. 7,8-DHF or vehicle was given from 4 to 8-weeks old. RESULTS: Expression of C1q in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult offspring from poly(I:C)-treated pregnant mice was significantly higher than that of control group. Early treatment with 7,8-DHF during juvenile and adolescent stages could prevent an increase of C1q in the PFC of adult offspring after MIA. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it is likely that increased C1q expression in the frontal cortex may play a role in the behavioral abnormalities of adult offspring after MIA. Furthermore, supplementation with a TrkB agonist such as 7,8-DHF during the prodromal stage may have prophylactic effects on the behavioral abnormalities after MIA."

Researches have indicated that apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-KO) mouse was associated with cognitive alteration via various mechanisms. Our present study investigated the possible mechanisms of cognitive impairment of ApoE-KO mouse fed with western type diet and the protective effects of 7,8-DHF in improving spatial learning and memory in ApoE-KO mouse. Five-weeks-old ApoE-KO mice and C57BL/6 mice were chronically treated with 7,8-DHF (with a dosage of 5 mg/kg) or vehicles orally for 25 weeks, and then subjected to Morris water maze at the age of 30 weeks to evaluate the cognitive performances. Afterward, histology analysis and western blotting were performed. Spatial learning and memory deficits were observed in ApoE-KO mice, which were consistent with higher expression of active-asparaginyl endopeptidase (active-AEP) as well as AEP-derived truncated tau N368 compared with normal group. In addition to that, long-term treatment of 7,8-DHF dramatically ameliorated cognitive decline in ApoE-KO mice, accompanied by the activation in phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) pathway and down-regulated expression of tau S396 and PHF-tau (phosphorylated tau at ser396 and ser404 epitope). These findings suggested that cognitive impairment of ApoE-KO mouse might associate with tau pathology and 7,8-DHF could activate AKT and then phosphorylate its downstream molecule to inhibit expression of abnormal tau, meanwhile, 7,8-DHF could reduce the expression of active-AEP and then inhibit production of truncated tau N368."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high affinity receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling plays a key role in the neurodevelopment. Pregnant mice exposed to polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] causes schizophrenia-like behavioral abnormalities in their offspring at adulthood. Here we found that the juvenile offspring of poly(I:C)-treated mice showed cognitive deficits, as well as reduced BDNF-TrkB signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Furthermore, the adult offspring of poly(I:C)-treated mice showed cognitive deficits, prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits, reduced BDNF-TrkB signaling, immunoreactivity of parvalbumin (PV) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) in the prelimbic (PrL) of medial PFC and CA1 of hippocampus. Supplementation of a TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (1 mg/mL in drinking water) during juvenile and adolescent stages could prevent these behavioral abnormalities, reduced BDNF-TrkB signaling in PFC and CA1, and immunoreactivity of PV and PGC-1α in the PrL of medial PFC and CA1 in the adult offspring from poly(I:C)-treated mice. These findings suggest that early intervention by a TrkB agonist in subjects with ultra-high risk for psychosis may reduce the risk of subsequent transition to schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a naturally-occurring flavone which possesses good bioavailability. Due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, previous studies have demonstrated that 7,8-DHF was a potent tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) agonist, and produced antidepressant-like effects in mouse forced swimming test and tail suspension test. However, it has not been evaluated in chronic mild stress (CMS), a classical depression model modulating the processes of major depression in human. In the present study, we not only evaluated the depressive-like behaviors, but also measured the key proteins of TrkB signaling in mice exposed to CMS. Our results firstly found that long term but not single injection of 7,8-DHF restored the depressive-like behaviors in sucrose preference test and novelty suppressed feeding test. In addition, 7,8-DHF not only increased TrkB phosphorylation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, but also activated the expression of TrkB downstream synaptic proteins such as PSD95 and synaptophysin. Furthermore, the TrkB antagonist K252a blocked the antidepressant-like effects of 7,8-DHF. In summary, the present results demonstrated that chronic 7,8-DHF treatment exerted significant antidepressant-like effects, which were likely attributed to regulating TrkB signaling and thus promoting synaptic protein expression.",

In this experiment, we examined whether 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, a novel potent TrkB agonist, could reverse the behavioral and biochemical abnormalities induced by the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm in rats. METHODS: SD rats were exposed to a battery of stressors for 56 days. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (5 and 20 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally during the last 28 days of the CMS paradigm. Rats were tested in sucrose consumption test (SCT), forced-swimming test (FST) and elevated T-maze (ETM). Serum corticosterone levels and hippocampal BDNF levels of the rats were measured. RESULTS: Four-week CMS on the rats induced their depression-like behavior in SCT. The CMS-reduced sucrose consumption was reversed starting from 7 days after the 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (20 mg/kg) treatment and remained across the subsequent treatment regime. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, when given at 5 mg/kg for 3 weeks, reduced the immobility time in the FST in the CMS-subjected rats. Additionally, the 4-week treatment with 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (20 mg/kg) attenuated the CMS-induced increase in anxiety-like behavior in the ETM. For the CMS-subjected rats, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone treatment dose-dependently reduced their serum corticosterone levels but increased their hippocampal BDNF levels only at 5 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: 7,8-dihydroxyflavone was beneficial for both depression and anxiety-like behaviors, and may exert fast-onset antidepressant effects. This provides a new insight into the pharmacological management of depression."

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the anticancer effects and mechanisms of action of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a monophenolic flavone, in melanoma cells. At concentrations not exhibiting cytotoxicity, 7,8-DHF potently inhibited growth and clonogenic survival of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells. Furthermore, it significantly blocked migration and invasion of the metastatic melanoma cells. We also observed that 7,8-DHF exhibits anti-melanogenic activity through inhibition of tyrosinase activity in α-MSH-stimulating condition. Notably, the suppressive activities of 7,8-DHF on melanoma progression were associated with the downregulation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its main downstream transcription targets, including hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and c-MET, by a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level. In addition, combination treatment with 7,8-DHF and resveratrol, a known therapeutic agent against melanoma, had greater anticancer activities and MITF inhibition than treatment with each single agent in α-MSH-treated B16F10 cells. Collectively, these findings may contribute to the potential application of 7,8-DHF in the prevention and treatment of malignant melanoma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and diminished dopamine content in the striatum, which is at least partly associated with α-synuclein protein overexpression in these neurons. Recent reports show that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a TrkB agonist, has beneficial effects in animal model of PD. However, it is unclear whether the therapeutic effects of DHF are associated with the expression of α-synuclein. AIMS: In this study, we investigated the protective effects of DHF on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced deficit of motor functions, the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the expression of α-synuclein as well as antioxidative activity in the C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: Mice were treated with MPTP (30 mg/kg, i.p.) once a day for 5 days to induce dopaminergic neuron death in the SN. DHF (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated once a day from the first day of MPTP injection until 9 days after the last injection of MPTP. Behavioral tests showed that DHF succeeded in ameliorating the impaired motor functions in the MPTP-treated mice. The immunohistochemical assay showed that the amelioration of motor function was accompanied by a reduction in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN and striatum. Western blot analyses showed that DHF prevented the inactivation of TrkB and suppressed α-synuclein overexpression in the SN and striatum following MPTP treatment. Antioxidative activity detection revealed that DHF prevented MPTP-induced reduction in glutathione and total superoxide dismutase activity in the SN and striatum. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicate that DHF treatment may suppress the accumulation of α-synuclein and oxidative stress via activating TrkB and subsequently block the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN and striatum, thereby ameliorating MPTP-induced motor deficits in the C57BL/6 mice.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after exposure to traumatic situations and it is characterized by cognitive deficits that include impaired explicit memory. The neurobiological bases of such PTSD-associated memory alterations are yet to be elucidated and no satisfactory treatment for them exists. To address this issue, we first studied whether a single exposure of young adult rats (60 days) to immobilization on boards (IMO), a putative model of PTSD, produces long-term behavioral effects (2-8 days) similar to those found in PTSD patients. Subsequently, we investigated whether the administration of the TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) 8 h after stress (therapeutic window) ameliorated the PTSD-like effect of IMO and the associated changes in synaptic plasticity. A single IMO exposure induced a spatial memory impairment similar to that found in other animal models of PTSD or in PTSD patients. IMO also increased spine density and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA3-CA1 pathway. Significantly, DHF reverted both spatial memory impairment and the increase in LTP, while it produced no effect in the controls. These data provide novel insights into the possible neurobiological substrate for explicit memory impairment in PTSD patients, supporting the idea that the activation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway fulfils a protective role after severe stress. Administration of DHF in the aftermath of a traumatic experience might be relevant to prevent its long-term consequences. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a notably important neurotrophin which regulates neuronal survival and differentiation in the nervous system. However, its clinical usage is particularly limited. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), which acts as a selective agonist of BDNF receptor TrkB, is reported to possess neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo. Here we explored the potent neuroprotective effects of 7,8-DHF in 6-OHDA induced rat and MPTP induced mouse model of Parkinsonism. The results demonstrated that treatment with 7,8-DHF in drinking water for four weeks (two weeks before 6-OHDA+two weeks after 6-OHDA lesion) significantly improved dopamine-mediated behaviors in 6-OHDA rat model, and prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Phospho-Y816-TrkB immunostaining showed that TrkB phosphorylation was significantly elevated in the SN in 7,8-DHF pretreated group, indicating 7,8-DHF activated TrkB and likely contributed to its neuroprotective effects. 7,8-DHF also protected acute MPTP neurotoxicity in mice but did not affect the climbing behavior in pole test. Thus our study indicates the neuroprotective properties of 7,8-DHF through the activation of TrkB, which provides a novel therapeutic treatment for Parkinson's disease.",

Our previous reports have shown that adult-born immature granular neurons in the dentate gyrus are the most vulnerable cell type in the hippocampus after receiving a moderate TBI with a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device. There is no effective approach to prevent immature neuron death or degeneration following TBI. Our recent study found that pretreatment of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a small molecule imitating brain-derived neurotrophic factor, protected immature neurons in the hippocampus from death following TBI. In the present study, we systemically treated moderate CCI-TBI mice or sham surgery mice with DHF once a day for 2 weeks via intraperitoneal injection, and then assessed the immature neurons in the hippocampus the 2nd day after the last DHF injection. We found that post-injury treatment of DHF for 2 weeks not only increased the number of adult-born immature neurons in the hippocampus, but also promoted their dendrite arborization in the injured brain following TBI. Thus, DHF may be a promising compound that can promote neurogenesis and enhance immature neuron development following TBI.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Anti-obesity effects of a natural plant flavonoid 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) were evaluated using 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. MAIN METHODS: The cell viability was determined using MTT assay. Effects of 7,8-DHF on intracellular lipid droplets and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay and Oil Red O staining method, respectively. Apoptotic cell death was monitored by annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and by a TUNEL assay. Antioxidant enzyme mRNA levels and protein expression of adipogenic transcription factors were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Whereas the cell viability of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was not affected by lower concentrations of 7,8-DHF (<20 μM), higher concentrations of 7,8-DHF (>20 μM) induced apoptotic cell death. 7,8-DHF (<20 μM) significantly reduced the intracellular lipid droplets and the expression of major adipogenic transcription factors, such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α), C/EBP-β, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ). 7,8-DHF treatment also dose-dependently reduced the intracellular ROS level, attenuated MAPK pathway activation, and increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study indicated that 7,8-DHF inhibits the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells by down-regulating the expression of adipogenic transcription factors, reduces lipid accumulation, and attenuates ROS accumulation by inducing antioxidant enzymes in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting for the first time that 7,8-DHF has an anti-obesity effect in vitro via its anti-oxidant activity.",

Flavonoids are also known to exert an inhibitory effect on the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family of tyrosine kinase receptors. VEGFR2 is one of the important receptors involved in the regulation of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and has also been implicated to exhibit various neuroprotective roles. Its upregulation and uncontrolled activity is associated with a range of pathological conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and various proliferative disorders. In this study, we investigated molecular interactions of 7,8-DHF and its derivatives with both the TrkB receptor as well as VEGFR2. Using a combination of molecular docking and computational mapping tools involving molecular dynamics approaches we have elucidated additional residues and binding energies involved in 7,8-DHF interactions with the TrkB Ig2 domain and VEGFR2. Our investigations have revealed for the first time that 7,8-DHF has dual biochemical action and its treatment may have divergent effects on the TrkB via its extracellular Ig2 domain and on the VEGFR2 receptor through the intracellular kinase domain. Contrary to its agonistic effects on the TrkB receptor, 7,8-DHF was found to downregulate VEGFR2 phosphorylation both in 661W photoreceptor cells and in retinal tissue.",

Poor and disturbed sleep remains a symptom of major depressive disorder and most current antidepressants affect sleep. Therefore, we conducted sleep/wake recordings and concomitant measurement of brain orexins, endogenous peptides that suppress sleep, in mice for this study. Baseline polysomnograph recording was performed for 24 h followed by treatment with either 5 mg/kg of DHF or vehicle at the beginning of the dark phase. Animals were sacrificed the following day, one hour after the final treatment with DHF. Orexin A and B were quantified using ELISA and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Total sleep was significantly decreased in the DHF group, 4 h after drug administration in the dark phase, when compared with vehicle-treated animals. This difference was due to a significant decrease of non-rapid eye movement sleep, but not rapid eye movement sleep. DHF increased power of alpha and sigma bands but suppressed power of gamma band during sleep in dark phase. Interestingly, hypothalamic levels of orexin A were also significantly decreased in the DHF group (97 pg/mg) when compared with the vehicle-treated group (132 pg/mg). However, no significant differences of orexin B were observed between groups. Additionally, no change was found in immobility tests.",

The causes of the various disorders are heterogeneous and the symptoms likewise are multifarious. Most of these disorders currently have very little available treatment that is effective in combating the plethora of serious symptoms. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a fundamental neurotrophin with vital functions during brain development. Pre-clinical studies have shown that increasing BDNF signalling may be a potent way to prevent, arrest or even reverse abnormal neurodevelopmental events arising from a variety of genetic or environmental causes. However, many difficulties make BDNF problematic to administer in an efficient manner. The recent discovery of a small BDNF-mimetic, the naturally occurring flavonoid 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), may provide an avenue to allow efficient and safe activation of the BDNF pathway in tackling the symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, evidence will be provided to support the potential of 7,8-DHF as a novel treatment for several neurodevelopmental disorders where the BDNF signalling pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology and where benefits are therefore most likely to be derived from its implementation.",

Cell death and dendrite degeneration in the cortex may contribute to persistent cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunction. There is still no approach available to prevent cells from death and dendrites from degeneration following TBI. When we treated the animals with a small molecule, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) that mimics the function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through provoking TrkB activation reduced dendrite swellings in the cortex. DHF treatment also prevented dendritic spine loss after TBI. Functional analysis showed that DHF improved rotarod performance on the third day after surgery. These results suggest that although DHF treatment did not significantly reduced neuron death, it prevented dendrites from degenerating and protected dendritic spines against TBI insult. Consequently, DHF can partially improve the behavior outcomes after TBI.",

We report here that activation of muscular TrkB by the BDNF mimetic, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), is sufficient to protect the development of diet-induced obesity in female mice. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that 7,8-DHF treatment enhanced the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in skeletal muscle, which resulted in increased systemic energy expenditure, reduced adiposity, and improved insulin sensitivity in female mice fed a high-fat diet. This antiobesity activity of 7,8-DHF is muscular TrkB-dependent as 7,8-DHF cannot mitigate diet-induced obesity in female muscle-specific TrkB knockout mice. Hence, our data reveal that chronic activation of muscular TrkB is useful in alleviating obesity and its complications.",

In the flavonoid class of compounds, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) has been reported to elicit tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) dimerization and autophosphorylation that further stimulates signaling cascades to promote cell survival/growth, differentiation, and plasticity. In this study we investigated if 7,8-DHF could prevent further loss of dopaminergic cells and terminals if introduced at the midpoint (i.e. intervention) of our progressive mouse model of PD. In our model, 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahyrdopyridine (MPTP) is administered with increased doses each week (8, 16, 24, 32-kg/mg) over a 4-week period. We found that despite 4 weeks of MPTP treatment, animals administered 7,8-DHF starting at the 2-week time period maintained 54% of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels within the dorsolateral (DL) striatum compared to the vehicle group, which was comparable to animals treated with MPTP for 2 weeks and was significantly greater compared to animals treated with MPTP for the full 4 weeks. Animals treated with MPTP and 7,8-DHF also demonstrated increased levels of, a sprouting-associated protein, superior cervical ganglion-10 (SCG10), phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB), and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) within the DL striatum and substantia nigra (SN) compared to the 4-week MPTP-treated animals. In addition, motor deficits seen in the 2- and 4-week MPTP-treated animals were restored following administration of 7,8-DHF. We are reporting here for the first time that intervention with 7,8-DHF blocks further loss of dopaminergic terminals and restores motor deficits in our progressive MPTP mouse model. Our data suggest that 7,8-DHF has the potential to be a translational therapy in PD.",

The effect of DHF on AD neuropathology remains not well defined. In this study we examined whether DHF affects APP processing and cognitive functions in vitro and in vivo. We found that DHF had no significant effect on amyloid β precursor protein (APP), BACE1 and amyloid β protein (Aβ). DHF had little effect on APP processing in cell cultures. DHF treatment did not reduce the deposition of Aβ to form neuritic plaques in the brain of AD model mice APP23/PS45. Furthermore, DHF did not alleviate learning and memory impairments in the AD model mice. Our study suggest that further extensive and careful studies are warranted for considering DHF as a new therapeutic agent for reducing amyloid pathology and alleviating cognitive deficits for AD treatment.",

The present study investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of TrkB activation by the TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) on traumatic brain injury (TBI). Mice subjected to controlled cortical impact received intraperitoneal 7,8-DHF or vehicle injection 10 min post-injury and subsequently daily for 3 days. Behavioral studies, histology analysis and brain water content assessment were performed. Levels of TrkB signaling-related molecules and apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed. The protective effect of 7,8-DHF was also investigated in primary neurons subjected to stretch injury. Treatment with 20 mg/kg 7,8-DHF attenuated functional deficits and brain damage up to post-injury day 28. 7,8-DHF also reduced brain edema, neuronal death, and apoptosis at day 4. These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in cleaved caspase-3 and increase in Bcl-2/Bax ratio. 7,8-DHF enhanced phosphorylation of TrkB, Akt (Ser473/Thr308), and Bad at day 4, but had no effect on Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, 7,8-DHF increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and promoted cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. This beneficial effect was attenuated by inhibition of TrkB or PI3K/Akt. 7,8-DHF also promoted survival and reduced apoptosis in cortical neurons subjected to stretch injury. Remarkably, delayed administration of 7,8-DHF at 3 h post-injury reduced brain tissue damage. Our study demonstrates that activation of TrkB signaling by 7,8-DHF protects against TBI via the PI3K/Akt but not Erk pathway, and this protective effect may be amplified via the PI3K/Akt-CREB cascades.",

The purpose of this paper was to examine the utility of 7, 8-DHF as an effective pharmacotherapeutic agent that targets dendritic pathology and cognitive impairments in FXS mutant. We synthesized pharmacologic, behavioral, and biochemical approaches to examine the effects of 7, 8-DHF on spatial and fear memory functions, and morphological spine abnormalities in fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene knock-out mice. The study found that 4 weeks of treatment with 7, 8-DHF improved spatial and fear memory, and ameliorated morphological spine abnormalities including the number and elongation of spines in the hippocampus and amygdala. Further mechanism analysis revealed that 7, 8-DHF enhanced the expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) GluA1 receptor, but reduced the normal levels of GluA2 at the synapses in Fmr1. Potentially related to drug-induced changes in AMPA receptor subunits, 7, 8-DHF at the synapses led to phosphorylation of specific serine sites on subunits Ser818 and Ser813 of GluA1, and Ser880 of GluA2, as well as phosphorylation of TrkB, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and protein kinase C. However, 7, 8-DHF neither affected behavioral performance nor increased TrkB phosphorylation in WT mice, which suggested that it had FXS-specific correcting effect. Altogether, these results demonstrated that 7, 8-DHF improved learning and memory, and reduced abnormalities in spine morphology, thus providing a potential pharmacotherapeutic strategy for FXS.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are the core symptoms of schizophrenia and major contributors to disability in schizophrenic patients, but effective treatments are still lacking. Previous studies have demonstrated that impaired BDNF/TrkB signaling is associated with the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) has recently been identified as a specific TrkB agonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier after oral or intraperitoneal administration. The present study aimed to assess the effect of 7,8-DHF on the cognitive and synaptic impairments of schizophrenia. A brief disruption of NMDA receptors with MK-801 during early development serves as an animal model for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. We found that MK-801-treated rats showed significant deficits in working learning ability and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, as well as reduction of BDNF, TrkB, and phosphorylated TrkB in the hippocampus. After intraperitoneal administration with 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg) once daily for a consecutive 14days, we found that chronic 7,8-DHF treatment significantly enhanced the activation of phosphorylated TrkB at the Y515 and Y816 sites, increased the phosphorylation levels of TrkB downstream signal cascades including ERK1/2, CaMKII, CREB and GluR1, and promoted hippocampal synaptic plasticity, which in turn rescued performance in spatial working learning. Our results thus demonstrate that activation of TrkB signaling can reverse the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia and strongly suggest a potential usefulness for 7,8-DHF or a TrkB agonist in treating schizophrenia-related cognitive impairments.",

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family known to play a prominent role in the differentiation and survival of MNs. The flavonoid 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a potent and selective small molecule tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) agonist that mimics the effects of BDNF. In the present study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of 7,8-DHF in a transgenic ALS mouse model (SOD1(G93A)). We found that chronic administration of 7,8-DHF significantly improved motor deficits, and preserved spinal MNs count and dendritic spines in SOD1(G93A) mice. These data suggest that 7,8-DHF should be considered as a potential therapy for ALS and the other motor neuron diseases.",

Although these studies highlight the potential of targeting BDNF/TrkB signaling, this strategy has not yet been tested in a model that develops the disease features that are most closely associated with cognitive decline in AD: severe synaptic and neuronal loss. In the present study, we investigated the impact of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a TrkB agonist, in CaM/Tet-DTA mice, an inducible model of severe neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cortex. Systemic 7,8-DHF treatment significantly improved spatial memory in lesioned mice, as measured by water maze. Analysis of GFP-labeled neurons in CaM/Tet-DTA mice revealed that 7,8-DHF induced a significant and selective increase in the density of thin spines in CA1 of lesioned mice, without affecting mushroom or stubby spines. These findings suggest chronic upregulation of TrkB signaling with 7,8-DHF may be an effective and practical strategy for improving function in AD, even after substantial neuronal loss has occurred.",

Up-regulation of HO-1 expression by DHF was both dose and time dependent in lung fibroblast V79-4 cells. DHF also increased the protein expression level of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and induced the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytosol into the nucleus, leading to elevated HO-1 expression. The siNrf2 RNA-transfection attenuated HO-1 expression induced by DHF treatment. In addition, DHF induced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), while U0126 (a specific pharmacological inhibitor of ERK kinase) abrogated DHF-activated Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. This suggests that DHF increased the levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 via ERK-dependent pathways. Furthermore, DHF significantly prevented the reduction of cell viability in response to oxidative stress; however, U0126 attenuated the protective effect of DHF. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DHF protected cells from oxidative stress via the activation of an ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.",

Recently, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects by acting as a selective tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) agonist. In addition, the antioxidant action of 7,8-DHF may protect neuronal cells against oxidative injury. In the present study, we used PC12 cells, a cell line generally thought to lack TrkB, to investigate the effect of 7,8-DHF on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanism. We found that 7,8-DHF effectively prevented cell death, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by 6-OHDA. In a cell free system, 7,8-DHF did not slow down extracellular auto-oxidation of 6-OHDA which may generate H2O2. However, We found that 7,8-DHF dramatically reduced cellular malondialdehyde content and phospho-histone H2A.X protein level. 7,8-DHF also elevated total superoxide dismutase activity in 6-OHDA-treated cells. These results indicate that 7,8-DHF might protect PC12 cells against 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity through its powerful antioxidant activity. By acting as a potent TrkB agonist and an antioxidant together with its easiness to pass across blood-brain barrier, 7,8-DHF may be developed into a promising candidate in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

This study investigated the mechanism by which 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) inhibits oxidative stress-induced 8-oxoG formation in hamster lung fibroblasts (V79-4). DHF significantly reduced the amount of 8-oxoG induced by hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and elevated the levels of OGG1 mRNA and protein. DHF increased the binding of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to antioxidant response element sequences in the upstream promoter region of OGG1. Moreover, DHF increased the nuclear levels of Nrf2, small Maf proteins, and the Nrf2/small Maf complex, all of which are decreased by H₂O₂ treatment. Likewise, the level of phosphorylated Akt, which activates Nrf2, was decreased by H₂O₂ treatment but restored by DHF treatment. The levels of OGG1 and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 protein were decreased upon treatment with PI3K inhibitor or Akt inhibitor, and DHF treatment did not restore OGG1 and nuclear Nrf2 levels in these inhibitor-treated cells. Furthermore, PI3K and Akt inhibitors abolished the protective effects of DHF in cells undergoing oxidative stress. These data indicate that DHF induces OGG1 expression via the PI3K-Akt pathway and protects cells against oxidative DNA base damage by activating DNA repair systems.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: It is widely recognized that methamphetamine (METH) induces behavioral abnormalities and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the brain. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its specific receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase (TrkB), in METH-induced behavioral abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined whether 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a novel potent TrkB agonist, could attenuate behavioral abnormalities and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice after administration of METH. RESULTS: Pretreatment with 7,8-DHF (3.0, 10, or 30 mg/kg), but not the inactive TrkB compound, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (5,7-DHF) (30 mg/kg), attenuated hyperlocomotion in mice after a single administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg), in a dose-dependent manner. The development of behavioral sensitization after repeated administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg/day, once daily for 5 days) was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg). Furthermore, pretreatment and subsequent administration of 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg) attenuated the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum after repeated administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg × 3 at 3-hourly intervals). Treatment with ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg), a potent TrkB antagonist, blocked the protective effects of 7,8-DHF on the METH-induced reduction of DAT in the striatum. Moreover, 7,8-DHF attenuated microglial activation in the striatum after repeated administration of METH. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 7,8-DHF can ameliorate behavioral abnormalities as well as dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice after administration of METH. It is likely, therefore, that TrkB agonists such as 7,8-DHF may prove to be potential therapeutic drugs for several symptoms associated with METH abuse in humans.",

      "abstract": "One of the factors that impairs in vitro produced porcine embryos is the oxidative stress that is mainly caused by the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidants activity, especially that of glutathione (GSH). Here, we examined the effect of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a kind of flavonoid antioxidant, on porcine oocyte maturation and its developmental competence. Porcine oocytes were cultured in media supplemented with 0, 1, 5 and 10 μM 7,8-DHF during both in vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro culture (IVC) after parthenogenetic activation. Maturation of oocytes was evaluated based on first polar body (PB) extrusion and intracellular GSH level, and developmental competence was assessed through observing cleavage and blastocyst formation. In each step, the levels of intracellular GSH and ROS were assessed by fluorescence intensity, and the apoptosis-related gene expression was examined using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The group treated with 1 μM 7,8-DHF during IVM and IVC showed increased cytoplasmic maturation and reached the blastocysts stage (36.1%) at a higher rate than the other groups (24.7, 16.0 and 10.3% for 0, 5 and 10 μM, P<0.05). In that group, the intracellular GSH level was significantly increased while ROS generation was significantly decreased after IVM and IVC (P<0.05). Moreover, it showed high expression of an anti-apoptotic gene (BCL2L1) and low expression of a pro-apoptotic gene (BAK1) (P<0.05). In conclusion, treatment with 1 μM 7,8-DHF during IVM and IVC showed an anti-apoptotic effect by increasing intracellular GSH synthesis and scavenging ROS and therefore improved the developmental competence of porcine embryos.",

This study was undertaken to examine whether the potent TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) could improve prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits in mice seen after a single dose of METH. Treatment with 7,8-DHF (3.0, 10 or 30 mg/kg) improved PPI deficits in mice associated with exposure to METH (3.0 mg/kg), in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, co-administration of ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg), a TrkB antagonist, significantly blocked the effects of 7,8-DHF (30 mg/kg) on METH-induced PPI deficits. In contrast, administration of 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (5,7-DHF: 30 mg/kg), an inactive TrkB ligand, did not affect METH-induced PPI deficits in mice. An in vivo microdialysis study in conscious mice showed that 7,8-DHF (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated increased dopamine release in the striatum, after METH administration (3 mg/kg). This study suggests that 7,8-DHF can improve PPI deficits in these mice, through the inhibition of METH-induced dopamine release. Therefore, it is likely that TrkB agonists, such as 7,8-DHF, may constitute a novel class of therapeutic drugs for neuropsychiatric diseases such as METH-use disorder and schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8 DHF) is a new recently identified TrkB receptor agonist, which possesses a potent neurotrophic activity and shares many physiological properties with the neurotrophin \"Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor\" (BDNF). However, its precise mechanism of action at the cellular level has not been clarified yet. In the present study we explored the effects of this agent on synaptic and intrinsic neuronal properties by performing whole-cell patch clamp recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Incubation of acute cortical slices with 7,8-DHF (20 µM) for 30 min caused a selective reduction in the strength of GABAergic inhibition. The amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) was significantly reduced to 48.2±8.9% of the control level. This might be a result of decreased presynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, as suggested by the reduced frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (control: 10.7±0.7 Hz, 7,8 DHF: 7.9±0.6 Hz) and increased Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR) (50±8.9%). Conversely, the glutamatergic transmission was unaffected. Moreover, 7,8-DHF was able to alter the intrinsic neuronal excitability, by significantly increasing spike frequency and input resistance (control: 243.75±23.4 MΩ, 7,8 DHF: 338.5±25.1 MΩ). Remarkably, all reported effects were abolished in presence of the TrkB receptor antagonist K252a indicating a direct involvement of TrkB receptors in the action of 7,8-DHF. These data indicate that 7,8-DHF might be one promising candidate for the development of a new class of drugs called \"BDNF mimetics\" for the future treatment of cognitive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophin family and a ligand for the tropomyosin-receptor kinase B (TrkB), mediates neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. However, BDNF is not used to treat neurodegenerative diseases because of its poor pharmacokinetic profile, side effects, and absence of survival properties in clinical trials. Consequently, alternative approaches such as TrkB receptor agonist application are gaining importance. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a member of the flavonoid family, has been described as a robust TrkB receptor agonist in hippocampal neurons. Nevertheless, the influence of 7,8-DHF on motoneurons, one of the main targets of BDNF in vivo, is so far unknown. Therefore, we investigated the impact of 7,8-DHF treatment on primary cultured mouse motoneurons. Indeed, we found an activation of the TrkB receptor. Moreover, 7,8-DHF application promotes survival and neurite growth of cultured motoneurons and these effects appear dose-dependent. To investigate the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway activation in 7,8-DHF treated motoneurons, we developed a high-density culture system of primary mouse motoneurons. Analysis of both pathways demonstrated a PI3K/AKT but not MAPK pathway activation in cultured motoneurons. This is in contrast to previously published reports about BDNF-mediated activation of TrkB. The lack of MAPK pathway activation is also in contrast to what has been found for hippocampal neurons that indeed show MAPK activation after 7,8-DHF treatment. The ability of 7,8-DHF to imitate BDNF function in motoneurons by using Trk receptor signaling would provide a new approach for the treatment of motoneuron diseases, but needs a more detailed analysis of the activation profile of 7,8-DHF.",

The increase in apoptosis was also associated with proteolytic activation of caspases, Bid cleavage, insertion of pro-apoptotic Bax into the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Furthermore, it was found that Bcl-2 overexpression markedly protected U937 cells from 7,8-DHF-induced apoptosis by restoring activation of caspases. In addition, 7,8-DHF treatment effectively activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and inhibitors of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 MAPK, which significantly reduced 7,8-DHF-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that the JNK and ERK pathways, and modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins were key regulators of apoptosis in response to 7,8-DHF in U937 cells.",

Loss of tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB)-mediated signaling has been implicated in this degeneration. Our study indicates that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8 DHF) robustly upregulates the TrkB signaling in the primary rat RGCs and the retinal neuronal precursor RGC-5 cell line by promoting phosphorylation of TrkB receptor, leading to enhanced TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase activity. The flavonoid derivative 7,8 DHF acts a potent TrkB agonist and upregulates the downstream AKT and MAPK/ERK survival signaling pathways in a TrkB-dependent manner in both primary rat RGCs as well as the RGC-5 cell line. Excitotoxicity and oxidative injury have been alleged in the specific RGC degeneration in various forms of glaucoma. A novel finding of this study is that treatment with 7,8 DHF protects these cells significantly from excitotoxic and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and cell death. 7,8 DHF also promotes neuritogenesis by stimulating neurite outgrowth, suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy for protection of RGCs in various optic neuropathies.",

We have previously demonstrated that 7,8-DHF in vitro rescues long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of aged rats. The present study assessed the effectiveness of 7,8-DHF on age-related declines in fear memories and amygdalar synaptic plasticity. We found that Sprague Dawley male rats began to show significant deficits in the acquisition and retention of memories for contextual and cued fear conditioning, as well as the reduction of BDNF, TrkB, and phosphorylated TrkB at the age of 25 months. Therefore, rats at 24 months old received intraperitoneal administration of either 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle once daily for a consecutive 4 weeks. At the end of treatment period, cognitive performance, amygdalar synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, and the phosphorylation of several proteins crucial to synaptic plasticity were evaluated. The results show that chronic 7,8-DHF treatments significantly enhanced the activation of phosphorylated TrkB at the Y515 and Y816 sites, increased spine density and number in several brain regions that process fear memory including the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, facilitated basolateral amygdalar synaptic plasticity, and in turn prevented performance in fear conditioning tasks from declining. Our results thus confirm a critical role for TrkB signaling activation by 7,8-DHF in preventing age-related declines in fear learning and memory and strongly suggest a potential usefulness for 7,8-DHF or a TrkB agonist in reversing age-related memory impairment.",

      "abstract": "7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) has recently been identified as a potential TrkB agonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier after i.p. administration. We previously demonstrated that 7,8-DHF in vitro rescues long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of aged rats. This study assessed the rescue effect of 7,8-DHF in vivo on aging-related cognitive impairment in rats, and further determined whether the effect of 7,8-DHF is age dependent. Aged rats at 22 and 30 months of age were pretested for spatial memory in Morris water maze. The aged-impaired rats were retested twice during 7,8-DHF or vehicle treatment, which started 3 weeks after the completion of the pretest. In the 22-month-old rats, daily i.p. administration of 7,8-DHF for 2 weeks improved spatial memory. The improvement in behavioral tests was associated with increases in synapse formation and facilitation of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, as well as the activation of several proteins crucial to synaptic plasticity and memory. A more extended treatment paradigm with 7,8-DHF was required to achieve a significant memory improvement in the severely impaired 30-month-old rats. Moreover, 7,8-DHF moderately facilitated the synaptic plasticity, modified the density but not number of spines in the hippocampus of the oldest rats. Taken together, our results suggest that 7,8-DHF can act in vivo to counteract aging-induced declines in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity and morphological changes of hippocampal neurons. The effect of 7,8-DHF is more pronounced in relatively younger impaired rats than in those of more advanced age. These findings demonstrate the reversal of age-dependent memory impairment by in vivo 7,8-DHF application and support the benefit of early treatment for cognitive aging.",

      "abstract": "7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a member of the flavonoid family, has received considerable attention as a selective tyrosine kinase receptor B agonist. Several studies have indicated that 7,8-DHF has neurotrophic and antioxidant activities. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory activity of 7,8-DHF. Therefore, we investigated whether 7,8-DHF affects the expression of inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Our results indicated that 7,8-DHF significantly attenuated secretion of LPS-induced inflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in RAW264.7 cells. Additionally, LPS-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and IL-1β was decreased by pre-treatment with 7,8-DHF. Our results also showed that 7,8-DHF reduces LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity via the suppression of the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and the degradation of inhibitor κB (lκB). In addition, 7,8-DHF inhibited the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory property of 7,8-DHF is related to the downregulation of iNOS, COX-2 and IL-1β, due to NF-κB inhibition as well as to the negative regulation of MAPK activation in RAW264.7 cells. Thus, 7,8-DHF may be a novel therapeutic agent for the prevention of various inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2), is a debilitating autism spectrum developmental disorder predominantly affecting females. Mecp2 mutant mice have reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain; conditional deletion and overexpression of BDNF in the brain accelerates and slows, respectively, disease progression in Mecp2 mutant mice. Thus we tested the hypothesis that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a small molecule reported to activate the high affinity BDNF receptor (TrkB) in the CNS, would attenuate disease progression in Mecp2 mutant mice. Following weaning, 7,8-DHF was administered in drinking water throughout life. Treated mutant mice lived significantly longer compared with untreated mutant littermates (80 ± 4 and 66 ± 2 days, respectively). 7,8-DHF delayed body weight loss, increased neuronal nuclei size and enhanced voluntary locomotor (running wheel) distance in Mecp2 mutant mice. In addition, administration of 7,8-DHF partially improved breathing pattern irregularities and returned tidal volumes to near wild-type levels. Thus although the specific mechanisms are not completely known, 7,8-DHF appears to reduce disease symptoms in Mecp2 mutant mice and may have potential as a therapeutic treatment for RTT patients.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that reductions in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) may have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the efficacy and safety profile of BDNF therapy (eg, gene delivery) remains to be established toward clinical trials. Here, we evaluated the effects of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a recently identified small-molecule TrkB agonist that can pass the blood-brain barrier, in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of AD. 5XFAD mice at 12-15 months of age and non-transgenic littermate controls received systemic administration of 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 10 consecutive days. We found that 7,8-DHF rescued memory deficits of 5XFAD mice in the spontaneous alternation Y-maze task. 5XFAD mice showed impairments in the hippocampal BDNF-TrkB pathway, as evidenced by significant reductions in BDNF, TrkB receptors, and phosphorylated TrkB. 7,8-DHF restored deficient TrkB signaling in 5XFAD mice without affecting endogenous BDNF levels. Meanwhile, 5XFAD mice exhibited elevations in the β-secretase enzyme (BACE1) that initiates amyloid-β (Aβ) generation, as observed in sporadic AD. Interestingly, 7,8-DHF blocked BACE1 elevations and lowered levels of the β-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (C99), Aβ40, and Aβ42 in 5XFAD mouse brains. Furthermore, BACE1 expression was decreased by 7,8-DHF in wild-type mice, suggesting that BDNF-TrkB signaling is also important for downregulating baseline levels of BACE1. Together, our findings indicate that TrkB activation with systemic 7,8-DHF can ameliorate AD-associated memory deficits, which may be, at least in part, attributable to reductions in BACE1 expression and β-amyloidogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients show cognitive deficits, but it is unclear whether these are a consequence of the pathology or a pre-existing factor of vulnerability to PTSD. Animal models may help to demonstrate whether or not exposure to certain stressors can actually induce long-lasting (LL; days) impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory tasks and to characterize neurobiological mechanisms. Adult male rats were exposed to 2-h immobilization on boards (IMO), a severe stressor, and spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) was studied days later. Exposure to IMO did not modify learning or short-term memory in the MWM when learning started 3 or 9 days after IMO, but stressed rats did show impaired long-term memory at both times, in accordance with the severity of the stressor. New treatments to prevent PTSD symptoms are needed. Thus, considering the potential protective role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on hippocampal function, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a recently characterized agonist of the BDNF receptor TrkB, was given before or after IMO in additional experiments. Again, exposure to IMO resulted in LL deficit in long-term memory, and such impairment was prevented by the administration of 7,8-DHF either 2 h prior IMO or 8 h after the termination of IMO. The finding that IMO-induced impairment of spatial memory was prevented by pharmacological potentiation of TrkB pathway with 7,8-DHF even when the drug was given 8 h after IMO suggests that IMO-induced impairment is likely to be a LL process that is strongly dependent on the integrity of the BDNF-TrkB system and is susceptible to poststress therapeutic interventions. 7,8-DHF may represent a new therapeutic approach for early treatment of subjects who have suffered traumatic experiences.",
