      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to prepare collagen peptides from bovine bone meal using a combination of heat pretreatment and enzymatic digestion, and to chelate them with calcium chloride to form peptide-calcium chelates. The effects of both on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts were investigated using cellular experiments (RAW 264.7 cells). RESULTS: Both bovine collagen peptides and their calcium chelates (BPs, HBPs, BPs-Ca, and HBPs-Ca) can significantly inhibit the RANKL-induced differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells into osteoclasts. The preheating treatment before enzymatic hydrolysis of bone materials has an improving effect on the inhibition of RAW 264.7 differentiation into osteoblasts by collagen peptides and their peptide calcium chelates. HBP and HBPs-Ca could significantly activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, among which HBPs-Ca was the most effective, which could significantly downregulate the mRNA expression of genes related to osteoclast differentiation, such as AP-1, c-Fos, TRAP, and NFATc1. Additionally, the expression of NF-κB p65, c-Fos, IKK and IκBα were also significantly inhibited after treatment with HBPs-Ca, with IKK being the most significantly downregulated, with an 8.2-fold reduction compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: HBPs and HBPs-Ca demonstrated stronger activity in inhibiting osteoclast formation compared to BPs and BPs-Ca. This enhanced activity is likely due to structural changes in the peptides caused by heat treatment, which increase their antioxidant properties and antagonistic effects on RANKL. These findings indicate that bovine collagen peptides and their calcium chelates can inhibit the formation of osteoclasts by activating the NF-κB pathway, thereby influencing bone metabolism and providing a theoretical basis for the treatment of osteoporosis. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out to identify patients ≥30 years old who underwent BCIR or ARCR for grade 3 partial thickness supraspinatus tears with ≥12 months follow up. Clinical outcomes assessed included range of motion, visual analogue score (VAS), American Shoulder Elbow Score (ASES) & Single Answer Numerical Evaluation (SANE) scores as well as clinical failure requiring revision surgery. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The minimally important clinical difference (MCID) was calculated. RESULTS: Participants included 48 patients who underwent BCIR and 37 who underwent ARCR, with a mean follow-up 27.3 ± 11.8 months, there were no significant baseline differences in demographics or tear characteristics between the cohorts. The mean surgical duration was shorter in the BCIR cohort (53 ± 10 vs 65 ± 17 minutes, p = 0.001). At final follow up there was no difference in ASES (p= .143), SANE (p = .167), VAS scores (p = .130), range of flexion (p = .159), abduction (p = .379) or external rotation (p = .281). Both groups obtained significant postoperative improvements (p < .02, for all). There was no difference in the achievement of the MCID for VAS (p = .999), SANE (p = .435) or ASES score (0.377). There was no significant difference in the rate of revision repair at final follow up 2.1% vs 5.4% (p = .577). CONCLUSION: BCIR of high grade partial thickness rotator cuff tears results in reliable improvements in pain, shoulder function and range of motion equivalent to traditional suture anchor repair. There was no difference in the rate of MCID achievement or revision surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Level III, retrospective comparative series."

      "abstract": "Genkwanin (GWA), a flavonoid compound found abundantly in various traditional Chinese medicines, has demonstrated pharmacological effectiveness against a range of diseases. However, its role in bone formation and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of GWA on osteogenic differentiation and to uncover the possible mechanisms. Primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and MC3T3-E1 cells induced for osteogenic differentiation were used as in vitro cell models. An ovariectomy (OVX) mouse model to induce secondary osteoporosis was used to evaluate the in vivo pharmacologic efficacy of GWA. Our studies revealed that GWA facilitated osteogenic differentiation and bio-mineralization of BMSCs and MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro, and could effectively prevent OVX-induced systematic bone loss and collagen Ⅰ α1 (COL1A1) reduction in vivo. Mechanism studies indicate that GWA could directly bind to phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK) to prevent the phosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) by JNK, thereby promote osteogenic differentiation and COL1A1 production via increasing the nuclear localization of NFATc1. This is distinct from the previously recognized function of the JNK/AP-1/NFATc1 signaling pathway in activating osteoclast differentiation. More importantly, GWA had no significant effects on estrogen-related signaling pathways, indicating a unique advantage in lowering the risk of gynecological cancer. In conclusion, our data suggest that GWA may be a promising candidate for the therapy of diseases associated with bone loss. Targeting pJNK-NFATc1 interaction may represent a new strategy to stimulate osteogenesis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple chondral lesions in the knee are difficult to manage. A few treatment options are available. Considering the number of lesions, size, location, and total surface area, the autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane (MACI) technique can effectively treat multiple defects simultaneously. INDICATIONS: The MACI procedure is indicated for multiple chondral lesions in the knee with large surface areas when other technologies are hard to implement or lack sufficient follow-up. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION: The chondral defects are debrided to subchondral bone with vertical walls. Concomitant procedures are to be completed before MACI implantation. Each defect is treated as an isolated lesion. Irregular and uncontained lesions require a unique approach. A single membrane can treat multiple lesions; however, careful presurgery analysis is necessary to analyze the requirement of an additional membrane. RESULTS: The MACI technique for multiple lesions in the knee has a good response rate and high satisfaction scores over mid- to long-term follow-up. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Multiple chondral lesions of the knee can effectively be treated with MACI, providing patients with additional improved quality of life, increasing level of function, and possibly delaying total knee arthroplasty procedures.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at investigating the characteristics of RA patients at different stages and at evaluating the potential application of low-dose interleukin-2 (ld-IL-2) during the preclinical stage. METHODS: Patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA), early RA (Ea-RA), new-onset RA (New-RA), and recurrent RA (Re-RA) were included. Clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected from all participants. A comparative analysis of arthritis-related clinical features and serum levels of IL-2 and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was conducted. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice received ld-IL-2 on days 0, 7, 14, and 28 after primary immunisation for 4 weeks. The percentages of Treg, Tfr, Tfh, and PD-1+Tfh cells were analysed. Additionally, naive CD4+ T cells were cultured in vitro to assess the effects of IL-2 on Tfh and Tfr differentiation. RESULTS: UA patients primarily exhibited early involvement of large joints. The sIL-2R level in UA patients was significantly lower than in those with Ea-RA, New-RA, and Re-RA and was comparable to levels in healthy controls. ld-IL-2 administration at different time points in the CIA model exerted varying effects on arthritis severity. Prophylactic ld-IL-2 administration reduced arthritis severity and incidence in CIA; it decreased the percentage of PD-1+Tfh cells while increasing Tfr cells, thereby restoring immune balance. All IL-2 intervention groups effectively reduced the Tfh/Tfr ratio and altered the distribution of B cell subsets. Mechanistically, ld-IL-2 primarily suppressed the differentiation of PD-1+Tfh cells and promoted Treg cell differentiation via STAT3 and STAT5 signalling, contributing to the restoration of immune tolerance. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that elevated sIL-2R levels in UA patients may predict progression to Ea-RA. Furthermore, ld-IL-2 restores immune tolerance by rebalancing Tfh/Tfr populations, highlighting its potential as a novel immunoregulatory strategy during the preclinical phase of RA. Key Points • Prophylactic low-dose IL-2 intervention reduces the severity and incidence of arthritis in the CIA model. • Low-dose IL-2 decreases the percentage of PD-1+Tfh cells while increasing Tfr cells, contributing to the restoration of immune balance."

Merr. has significant anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. However, the anti-RA effect and mechanism of TIN have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: This study elucidates the mechanism of TIN in alleviating collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats based on the gut microbiome-metabolomic-immunity axis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established CIA rat model to evaluate the efficacy of TIN. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, fecal metabolomics profiling and the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids determination to investigate the effect of TIN on gut microbiota composition and metabolome changes. Histopathology showed that TIN protected the intestinal barrier, then use ELISA and flow cytometry to analyze the mechanism of TIN, and qRT-PCR and WB were employed for verification. RESULTS: TIN ameliorated joint damage and inflammation in CIA rats, histopathological observation confirmed that TIN had protective effect on intestinal barrier. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis and fecal metabolomics profiling confirmed that TIN intervention regulates the composition of gut microbiome and promote the propagation of probiotics, the abundance changes of 12 serum metabolites in the CIA group were reversed by TIN intervention. After intervention with TIN, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, and caproic acid rise significantly, but acetic acid cannot be reversed. Then ELISA and flow cytometry confirmed that TIN intervention could regulate the level of inflammatory factors, maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier and restoring the imbalance of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg ratios in the colon of CIA rats. CONCLUSION: TIN inhibited the inflammatory response of CIA rats by regulating the gut microbiome-metabolome-immunity axis, reversed the abnormalities of intestinal flora and differential metabolites, and maintained the integrity of the intestinal barrier."

      "abstract": "Collagen plays a crucial role in platelet activation and thrombosis, yet the underlying mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) remain incompletely understood. This study investigated how collagen modulates ROS generation and platelet aggregation both in vitro and in vivo, as well as evaluating the protective effects of antioxidants. In vitro, collagen induced dose-dependent platelet aggregation and increased ROS generation, evidenced by the enhanced EMPO adduct formation detected via electron spin resonance (ESR). In vivo experiments demonstrated that collagen administration significantly accelerated CAT-1 decay, indicating elevated oxidative stress with a transient peak around 1 minute post-treatment. Furthermore, escalating collagen doses correlated with increased ROS generation and reduced survival rates in mice, underscoring collagen's impact on oxidative stress and thrombosis severity. Importantly, treatment with enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (DMTU, Tiron, mannitol) significantly attenuated collagen-induced oxidative stress and improved animal survival. Collectively, these findings elucidate the pivotal role of ROS in collagen-induced platelet activation and thrombosis and highlight antioxidants as promising therapeutic candidates for preventing thrombotic disorders and managing cardiovascular risk."

      "abstract": "AIM: To compare a dense polytetrafluoroethylene (dPTFE) membrane with a collagen membrane in guided bone regeneration for lateral bone augmentation at single sites in the anterior maxilla in terms of alveolar width, height, complications, need for additional therapy and implant outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a class 4 defect at a single site in the anterior maxilla (15-25) were recruited at five centres. Following flap elevation and conditioning of the recipient site, they were randomly allocated to the dPTFE membrane group or the collagen membrane group. Nine months following bone augmentation, re-entry was performed and implants were placed. Alveolar dimensions were assessed on superimposed cone-beam computed tomography images taken prior to surgery, immediately post operation and at 9 months. Implant outcomes were registered 1 year after bone augmentation. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were randomised (dPTFE membrane group: 8 females, 10 males, mean age 39; collagen membrane group: 14 females, 4 males, mean age 51) and all complied until the 1-year follow-up. At 9 months, the estimated marginal mean alveolar width was not significantly different between the groups (estimated marginal mean difference at 3 mm below the crest: 0.65 mm; 95% CI: -0.82 to 2.12; p = 0.381). Infection occurred in 6/18 patients treated with a dPTFE membrane and in 0/18 patients treated with a collagen membrane (p = 0.019). Infection occurred in every centre and had a negative impact on the alveolar width at 9 months, despite taking anti-infective measures in every patient and additional bone augmentation in two patients. Implants could be installed in a prosthetically driven position, integrated uneventfully and yielded minimal marginal bone loss. CONCLUSION: dPTFE membrane and collagen membrane are both effective in lateral bone augmentation. However, dPTFE membrane is more prone to infection than collagen membrane, thereby increasing the need for additional therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05426616."

Human keloid fibroblasts (KFs) and normal fibroblasts were cultured in vitro.

FTO, KLF4, and MC1R expressions were quantified via qRT-PCR, while the protein levels of FTO, KLF4, MC1R, Collagen I, and Collagen III were determined by Western blot. The m6A RNA methylation status of total RNA was evaluated using the EpiQuik m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit. Post-actinomycin D treatment, the stability of KLF4 mRNA and its m6A modification level were measured. ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed the binding between KLF4 and MC1R promoter. KFs presented with significantly enhanced proliferation and collagen deposition, correlating with elevated FTO expression. Silence of FTO repressed the proliferation and collagen deposition of KFs, and elevated the m6A levels of total RNA and KLF4 mRNA in KFs, resulting in enhanced KLF4 mRNA stability and expression. KLF4 bound to the MC1R promoter and promoted MC1R expression. In conclusion, FTO represses KLF4 expression by removing m6A modification and further diminishes MC1R expression, thereby facilitating KF proliferation and collagen deposition."

Periodontitis can be treated using metronidazole but long-term use can cause negative effects. Natural ingredients such as robusta coffee husk can be used as an alternative treatment for periodontitis because of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial benefits. Aim: To determine the effect of robusta coffee husk extract on the number of fibroblasts and collagen density in gingival Wistar rats induced by P. gingivalis. Methods: Robusta coffee husk extract was extracted using the maceration process with 96% ethanol. Thirty male Wistar rats divided into 6 treatment groups: healthy rat, negative control (P. gingivalis + Aquades sterile), positive control (P. gingivalis + metronidazole), and 3 treatment groups of extract concentration (P. gingivalis + 125, 250, and 500 mg/kgBW). P. gingivalis injection was carried out in the buccal area of the left mandibular first molar of mice every 3 days. Robusta coffee husk extract and metronidazole were given by using sondase once a day for 21 days. The gingival specimens were then processed histologically. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was performed to observe the number of fibroblast, and collagen density was observed by Thricome Mallory. The SPSS application was used to examine the data calculation which included the Shapiro-Wilk, Levene, One-way ANOVA, and post hoc LSD tests. Result: Robusta coffee husk extract at doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg/kgBW showed increased fibroblasts and collagen density in Wistar rats induced by P. gingivalis. Conclusion: The most effective dose of robusta coffee husk extract is 250 mg/kgBW, with an average value of fibroblast number in a field of view is 37 cells, and the average of collagen density in the field of view is 163 pixels."

      "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a dense, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits therapeutic efficacy. This study investigates the role of cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1, also known as Cyr61), an extracellular matrix-associated protein, in modulating the TME of PDAC. It is demonstrated that Ccn1 promotes PDAC progression by upregulating collagen and chemokine expression, thereby facilitating immune cell exclusion and enhancing tumor growth. Using a Ccn1-deficient PDAC model, decreased collagen and chemokine levels are observed, resulting in increased infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells and reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Furthermore, Ccn1-deficient tumors exhibit heightened sensitivity to gemcitabine and show enhanced responsiveness to anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD1) therapy. Mechanistically, Ccn1 regulates chemokine production through collagen expression, with chemokine levels remaining suppressed even upon interferon-gamma treatment in collagen-deficient cells. These findings highlight Ccn1 as a potential therapeutic target that reprograms the TME to enhance the efficacy of both chemotherapy and immunotherapy in PDAC, providing a novel approach for overcoming immune resistance in PDAC."

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, rheological and gel content results proved the crosslinking effect of OPL. Mechanical properties of FOPL2 and FOPL3 films was >2 times higher than FPL film. The viability of human skin fibroblast cells was higher than the control for all films, and antibacterial activity of the film FOPL3 was significantly higher compared to other films. Wound healing effect of FOPL3 film was evaluated in a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) infected full-thickness skin defect model in mice. The results showed a significantly lower wound area after 7,10,14 days of treatment compared to the control group treated by normal saline.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammation disorder affecting the joints, it has a complex pathophysiology including inflammatory cells (macrophages, CD4 + T and B-cells), oxidative markers (ROS, NO, MDA, GSH, and catalase). Inflammation promoting cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, IL6, IL-17, and CRP create a feedback loop and irreversibly damage joints. NSAIDs and DMARDs treatments have adverse effects demanding for safer treatment options. PURPOSE: The study aimed to validate the anti-arthritic efficacy of Cassia fistula fruit pulp extracts (aqueous, hydro-ethanolic, and ethanolic). METHODS: Extracts were prepared and chemically characterized through LC-MS. Chrysophanol and rhein present in extracts were evaluated for anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant potential on LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cell line. Extracts were evaluated for in-vivo anti-inflammatory (cytokine estimation), anti-oxidant potential (estimating oxidative stress markers) and micro-structural changes (histopathology of knee and ankle) in collagen-induced arthritis. RESULTS: In-vitro study revealed significant anti-inflammatory potential against IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and ROS determination showed strong anti-oxidant potential of chrysophanol and rhein at 10 μM. In-vivo studies revealed that ethanolic extract significantly inhibited IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17 production and reduced NO, MDA and augmented GSH, catalase levels significantly. Combined efficacy of ethanolic extract against inflammation, and oxidative stress thus, significantly reduced cellular infiltration, bone, cartilage damage and improved joint space in knee and ankle joints assessed through histopathology. Improved joint micro-structure ameliorated paw swelling, paw volume and disease score significantly. Thus, ethanolic extract of C. fistula fruit pulp may be an alternate or complementary treatment for managing RA."

      "abstract": "Scaffolds play a crucial role in tissue engineering as regenerative templates. Fabricating scaffolds with good biocompatibility and appropriate mechanical properties remains a major challenge in this field. This study proposes a method for preparing multi-material scaffolds, enabling the 3D printing of collagen and thermoplastic elastomers at room temperature. Addressing the previous challenges such as the poor printability of pure collagen and the difficulty of maintaining structural integrity during multilayer printing, this research improved the printability of collagen by optimizing its concentration and pH value and completed the large-span printing of thermoplastic elastomer using a precise temperature-control system. The developed hybrid scaffold has an interconnected porous structure, which can support the adhesion and proliferation of fibroblasts. The scaffolds were further treated with different post-treatment methods, and it was proven that the neutralized and cross-linked collagen scaffold, which has both nano-fibers and a certain rigidity, can better support the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The research results show that the collagen thermoplastic elastomer hybrid scaffold has significant clinical application potential in soft tissue and hard tissue regeneration, providing a versatile solution to meet the diverse needs of tissue engineering."

The objective of this study was to draw attention to the limits of a collagen-elastin dermal matrix (MatriDerm®) in its 1 mm variant for the treatment of burn scars on the face and neck. Materials and Methods: A case series of four patients (three women and one man) with burn scars of the face (one case) and of the neck (three cases) treated with collagen-elastin matrices is presented. In all cases, the excision or release of the scars was performed, and the defects were covered with MatriDerm® and thin split-thickness skin grafts in the same operative time. Results: In all cases, the graft take was very good but was followed by the important contraction of the graft to such an extent that the results were found to be poor by both the surgeons and the patients. The surface of the new scar was irregular, and the elasticity was low. The article points out some probable causes and draws attention to the need for more objective studies regarding the use of this dermal matrix in burn scars of the head and neck. Conclusions: This collagen-elastin 1 mm dermal matrix should be used with caution for the surgical treatment of burn scars of the head and neck area, and its indication should be carefully weighted.",

A promising alternative for corneal replacement involves fabricating artificial cornea from a patient's own cells. Our study aimed to leverage bioprinting to develop a corneal model using human corneal stromal cells embedded in a collagen-based bioink. We generated both cellular and acellular collagen I (COL I) constructs. Cellular constructs were cultured for up to 4 weeks, and gene expression analysis was performed to assess extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and fibrotic markers. Our results demonstrated a significant decrease in the expression of COL I, collagen III (COL III), vimentin (VIM), and vinculin (VCL), indicating a dynamic remodeling process towards a more physiologically relevant corneal ECM. Overall, our study provides a foundational framework for developing customizable, corneal replacements using bioprinting technology. Further research is necessary to optimize the bioink composition and evaluate the functional and biomechanical properties of these bioengineered corneas."

This review thoroughly analyzes collagen dressing advances, examining different formulations such as hydrogels, films, and foams that enhance wound care. The important processes by which collagen promotes healing (e.g., promoting angiogenesis, encouraging cell proliferation, and offering structural support) are discussed to clarify its function in tissue regeneration. The effectiveness and adaptability of collagen dressings are demonstrated via clinical applications investigated in acute and chronic wounds. Additionally, commercially accessible collagen-based skin healing treatments are discussed, demonstrating their practical use in healthcare settings. Despite the progress, the study discusses the obstacles and restrictions encountered in producing and adopting collagen-based dressings, such as the difficulties of manufacturing and financial concerns. Finally, the current landscape's insights indicate future research possibilities for collagen dressing optimization, bioactive agent integration, and overcoming existing constraints. This analysis highlights the potential of collagen-based innovations to improve wound treatment methods and patient care."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of wound complications after breast cancer surgery is > 30%. Delayed wound healing increases the risk of systemic recurrence up to three-fold after excisional surgery for primary breast cancer. Patients with breast malignant tumors exhibit immune system dysfunction while T cells play a major role in the inflammatory process of wound healing. The time required to achieve wound closure depends on the severity of the wound. The content of Piper crocatum ethanol extract contains alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, and polyphenols. Flavonoid and polyphenol compounds are antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticancer, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory. AIM: To determine whether P. crocatum extract increases interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, TGF-β1 and VEGF expression, collagen density, and the clinical features of wounds, and how the mechanism works on wound healing of Wistar rats after excision of mammary tumors. METHODS: This study used 35 female Wistar rats, 30 mammary tumor models by injecting 3-5% benzopyrene as much as 50 mg/Kg.BW in 5 injections into the mammary glands/mammae every 2 days as much as 10 mg/kg.BW. Thirty rats were divided into 5 groups; red betel extract gel 50%, 25%, and 12.5%; povidone iodine group as a positive control; and carboxymethyl cellulose natrium (CMC na) group as a negative control, 5 normal wounds as controls. Treatment was given 2 times a day for 14 days. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression results; P. crocatum extract decreased IL-10 levels by -0.64 (p = 0.025), decreased TGF-β1 expression -0.832 (p = 0.001), increased VEGF expression by 0.638 (p = 0.026), and decreased collagen density by -0.605 (p = 0.037) in mammary tumor post-excision rat wounds. CONCLUSION: There is an effect of P. crocatum extract on the wound of Wistar rats after excision of mammary tumor by the mechanism of decreased IL-10 levels and TGF-β1 expression, increased VEGF expression, and decreased collagen density through increased VEGF expression is studied in this article.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung disease is the most overrepresented cause of death in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Animal studies have demonstrated potentiated autoimmunity, arthritis, and profibrotic/inflammatory lung disease with a combination of airborne exposures and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model that recapitulates features of RA-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). As patients with RA-ILD demonstrate unique circulating monocyte subpopulations, this study aims to characterize lung infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in a mouse model of RA-ILD and determine whether reducing these cells mitigates the development of lung disease. METHODS: Autoimmune-prone DBA/1J mice received intranasal inhalation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) daily for up to 5 weeks and CIA induction. Experimental groups included Sham (saline injection/saline inhalation), CIA (CIA/saline), LPS (saline/LPS), and CIA+LPS (CIA/LPS). Lung disease was assessed by longitudinal imaging, lung function measurements, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissues, and lung histopathology. Cell subpopulations were analyzed by single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry. Intravenous clodronate liposome administration was employed to reduce circulating monocytes. RESULTS: Longitudinal imaging demonstrated increased lung volume and tissue density in CIA+LPS mice. Lung function assessment showed reduced compliance and increased airway resistance with dual exposure. Unsupervised clustering revealed 16 discrete clusters among the experimental groups with robust clusters of monocytes/macrophages of overlapping characteristics for both CIA+LPS and CIA. By flow cytometry, dual CIA+LPS exposure induced activated CD11c+CD206+CD11b+MHC Class IIhiCD80+ alveolar macrophages, CD11cmidCD206-CD11b+Ly6Chi(and Ly6Clo)MHC Class IIhiCD80+CD86+ interstitial macrophages, and CD11c-CD11b+Ly6ChiMHC Class IIhiCD80+CD86+ monocytic-like cells. MHC Class IIhi-expressing cells across monocyte/macrophage subpopulations of CIA+LPS treated mice were more aligned with CIA than LPS alone. Intravenous clodronate liposome administration reduced CIA+LPS-induced both CD11c+CD11b+ and CD11cmidCD11b+ lung macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, inflammatory/pro-fibrotic mediators, and expression of vimentin and citrullinated and malondialdehyde acetaldehyde (MAA)-modified proteins/lung autoantigens. CONCLUSION: The interaction of inhalation-induced airway inflammation and autoimmune arthritis results in lung disease associated with uniquely activated infiltrating inflammatory interstitial macrophages. Moreover, depletion of circulating monocytes attenuated lung disease. Whereas the induced interstitial macrophage immunophenotype is more aligned to CIA than endotoxin exposure, co-exposure modeling renders unique features that potentially inform the pathogenesis and treatment of RA-ILD.",

We present the ectasia progression and treatment outcomes after corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) in 5 patients with post-LASIK ectasia aged older than 50 years. METHODS: This retrospective case series included patients with post-LASIK ectasia. Primary outcome parameters included preoperative and postoperative best corrected distance visual acuity (logMAR best corrected visual acuity). Corneal topography values included maximum keratometry (Kmax), flat keratometry (K1), and steep keratometry (K2). All patients underwent epithelium-off CXL using the Dresden protocol. RESULTS: Five eyes of 5 patients were included. The mean patient age at CXL was 62.8 years (range 51-73 years). The average time since laser in situ keratomileusis surgery was 19 years (range 16-24 years). Patients were followed preoperatively for 343 days ± 150 and postoperatively for 3 to 5 years. Postoperatively, flattening of K2 and improvement in logMAR best corrected visual acuity were noted in all patients. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike primary corneal ectasia, post-LASIK corneal ectasia progresses in older patients. Our results support that CXL is effective in patients with post-LASIK ectasia aged older than 50 years."

Collagen-based micro/nanogels, in particular, are valued for their increased surface area, tunable degradation rates, and ability to facilitate targeted drug delivery, making them instrumental in advanced therapeutics and tissue engineering endeavors. Although extensive reviews on micro/nanogels exist, they tend to cover a wide range of biomaterials and lack a specific focus on collagen-based materials. The current review offers an in-depth look into the manufacturing technologies, drug release mechanisms, and biomedical applications of collagen-based micro/nanogels to address this gap. First, we provide an overview of the synthetic strategies that allow the precise control of the size, shape, and mechanical strength of these collagen-based micro/nanogels by controlling the degree of cross-linking of the materials. These properties are crucial for their performance in biomedical applications. We then highlight the environmental responsiveness of these collagen-based micro/nanogels, particularly their sensitivity to enzymes and pH, which enables controlled drug release under various pathological conditions. The discussion then expands to include their applications in cancer therapy, antimicrobial treatments, bone tissue repair, and imaging diagnosis, emphasizing their versatility and potential in these critical areas. The challenges and future perspectives of collagen-based micro/nanogels in the field are discussed at the end of the review, with an emphasis on the translation to clinical practice. This comprehensive review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and scientists alike, providing insights into the current state and future directions of collagen-based micro/nanogel research and development."

Neferine possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and cardioprotective properties, but its effectiveness in the treatment of RA remains unclear. Our study aimed to explore the impact of neferine administration on ankle joint inflammation and cardiac complications of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. The CIA model was introduced in male DBA/1 mice via subcutaneous injection of Type II collagen (CII) into the tail. We found that neferine alleviated ankle joint inflammation, cartilage erosion, and bone destruction, as well as reduced the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18 in the serum of CIA mice. Furthermore, neferine reduced the expression of synovial damage markers (RANKL, MMP-3, and MMP-13) in the ankle joints of CIA mice. Mechanistically, neferine lowered the levels of NF-κB pathway-related molecules such as p-IκBα, p-p65, and nuclear p65 in the synovial tissue of CIA mice. Simultaneously, neferine reversed the upregulation of NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved-caspase-1 levels in the synovial tissue of CIA mice. Additionally, our results showed that neferine reduced the contents of myocardial injury markers (cTnI, CK-MB, and LDH), alleviated myocardial fibrosis, decreased expression of α-SMA and Collagen I, as well as mitigated the activation of fibrosis-related TGF-β/Smad signaling. In summary, our study demonstrates that neferine attenuates chondral and synovial inflammation in a CIA mouse model by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome, and neferine has a protective effect on the hearts of CIA mice."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Postamputation pain remains a significant clinical challenge, affecting a substantial proportion of individuals with limb loss. Among its etiologies, symptomatic neuromas-resulting from aberrant peripheral nerve regeneration-are a common source of residual limb pain. These lesions often lead to severe discomfort and a considerable decline in the quality of life. Although surgical treatments are available, they are often invasive and carry a risk of complications, especially in elderly or frail patients. Nonsurgical interventions, such as steroid injections, provide temporary relief but lack long-term efficacy. PATIENT CONCERNS: This case study investigates the use of in situ collagen injections as a novel treatment for symptomatic neuroma in an 87-year-old patient with a longstanding transfemoral amputation. The patient had experienced similar symptoms multiple times before, marked by exacerbation and partial remission periods. However, these symptoms have become more intense and disabling over the past 3 months. DIAGNOSES: A thorough neurological evaluation revealed no overt motor or sensory deficits aside from pain, hypersensitivity, and tenderness above a soft tissue mass on the posteromedial side of the transfemoral stump. Elicitation of Tinel's sign reproduced both phantom and residual limb pain. A diagnosis of symptomatic postamputation neuroma was established based on clinical criteria and further corroborated by ultrasound imaging, which allowed direct visualization of the neuroma. INTERVENTIONS: The therapeutic protocol involved 2 ultrasound-guided perineuromal injections of a porcine-derived collagen medical device, administered 3 days apart. Pain intensity and sonographic characteristics of the neuroma were assessed over a 12-week follow-up period. OUTCOMES: Results indicated a significant reduction in pain 1 week after the second injection, with improvements lasting up to 4 weeks. Functional outcomes, including prosthetic tolerance, also showed improvement. However, the treatment's effect diminished by the 12-week follow-up. LESSONS: This case highlights the potential utility of in situ collagen injections as a safe, minimally invasive therapeutic option for symptomatic neuromas. Although the observed analgesic and functional benefits warrant further investigation, collagen injections could offer a new therapeutic approach for managing neuroma pain and serve as a promising alternative to more invasive interventions, especially in the elderly and multimorbid patients.",

This study evaluated the efficacy of new collagen-based products and compared them to commercial products in a murine model of cutaneous healing. Circular excisional defects were generated on 72 Wistar rats. Six study groups were established according to the administered collagen treatment: Control (without treatment), SD-C (semidenatured), Catrix, Hy-C (hydrolyzed), N-C (native) and Helix3-CP. Seven and eighteen days post-surgery, animals were euthanized. Wound closure was macroscopically assessed by taking zenithal images of the defects. Morphological, histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed to evaluate the healing process. After 7 days, open areas and degree of epithelialization were similar among the groups. Significant differences were observed in contraction between control and the N-C and Helix3-CP groups. Untreated animals exhibited a more pronounced granulation tissue with a high number of inflammatory cells and a disorganised extracellular matrix with type III collagen deposition. After 18 days, animals treated with new collagen (Hy-C and N-C) exhibited accelerated wound closure, increased epithelialization and a more organised granulation tissue. Local administration of new collagen treatments promotes the progression of the reparative process and significantly accelerates wound closure compared with nontreated wounds.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of collagen peptides and Saccharomyces boulardii on acetic acid (AA)-induced colitis. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following four groups: normal control (NC), colitis control (CC), collagen peptide (CP; 0.6 g/kg/day), and S. boulardii (SB; 250 mg/day). Colitis was induced by an intrarectal administration of AA in all groups except NC, and treatments were administered daily for 7 days. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by assessing the disease activity index (DAI), colon mass index, macroscopic and microscopic tissue damage, histopathological changes, zonula occludens (ZO)-1 protein expression, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The results showed that CP and SB treatments substantially alleviated DAI scores (p < 0.05) and reduced the colon mass index. Colon macroscopic and microscopic damages improved compared to the CC group (p < 0.01). Histologically, both treatments reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, crypt damage, and ulceration, with CP showing a slightly more pronounced effect. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant restoration of ZO-1 protein expression in the treated groups, indicating improvement in intestinal barrier integrity (p < 0.01). Furthermore, MPO activity was reduced in both CP and SB groups, significantly in the SB group (p < 0.01). These findings are consistent with previous studies that highlight the anti-inflammatory and barrier-enhancing effects of collagen peptides and probiotics in UC models."

METHODS: The study was designed as a randomized, controlled clinical trial. This trial was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov with the identifier NCT05870774 and is accessible under the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05870774?term=NCT05870774&rank=1. This clinical trial was not registered prior to participant recruitment and randomization. Patients with a single tooth gap and horizontal soft tissue thickness deficiency were enrolled in the study. Sites were randomly allocated to the control (SCTG) or test group (VXCM: Geistlich Fibro-Gide, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) to augment buccal soft tissue thickness. The primary outcome was soft tissue gain 3 months post-op. Secondary outcomes included soft tissue gain 6 months post-op, the pink aesthetic score (PES), and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). RESULTS: Patients' recruitment started on 28 October 2021 and ended on 25 December 2022. Thirty-two patients were enrolled and subjected to intervention. Sixteen patients were included per group. Three months post-op, soft tissue gain at the buccal site was 1.77 ± 0.61 mm in the VXCM group and 1.26 ± 0.41 mm in the SCTG group (p = 0.0003). Six months post-op, soft tissue gain was 1.11 ± 0.44 mm in the VXCM group and 1.43 ± 0.81 mm in the SCTG group (p = 0.0459). PROMs, including pain perception, favored the VXCM group. SCTG demonstrated favored results in PES. CONCLUSION: SCTG remains the gold standard for increasing soft tissue thickness in terms of the clinical result.",

Herein, we describe a porcine wound model infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and examine the ability of an antimicrobial barrier composed of native type I collagen and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PCMP) to serve as a barrier to protect wounds and support progression through the innate wound healing cascade. Wounds were inoculated with MRSA and allowed to form a biofilm for 72 h, subjected to standard of care sharp debridement, then either left untreated or received PCMP for 5, 10, 15 or 20 days. Wounds were assessed for bioburden, wound closure and expression of genes related to wound healing. Wounds treated with PCMP exhibited statistically lower MRSA levels compared to untreated controls and achieved 90% closure by 2 weeks of treatment. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that by reducing bacterial load, wounds progressed through the innate wound healing cascade, while untreated wounds exhibited a dampening of the immune response. Additionally, for randomly assigned wounds, PCMP was not reapplied at dressing changes to assess the impact of inconsistent wound protection. At all timepoints, a resurgence in bioburden was observed following removal of PCMP if the wounds had not fully closed. This study highlights the value of PCMP as an antimicrobial barrier and the importance of protecting wounds through closure and resolution.",

Due to pathophysiological complexity and underlying patient comorbidities, conducting randomised controlled trials to evaluate the comparative efficacy of advanced treatment modalities is difficult, as many patients would likely be excluded. This retrospective, pragmatic, real-world evidence (RWE) study compared the healing outcomes of VLUs treated with either ovine forestomach matrix (OFM) (n = 312) or collagen/oxidised regenerated cellulose (ORC) (n = 239) in outpatient wound care centres. Unlike restrictive randomised controlled trials, minimal inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to create two treatment cohorts that reflected the general VLU population. The incidence (%) of closure was greater in OFM-treated VLUs at 12, 24 and 36 weeks, and this difference was significant at 24 and 36 weeks compared to collagen/ORC. Median time to wound closure was significantly faster (p = 0.045) in the OFM cohort (11.1 ± 0.6 weeks) compared to the collagen/ORC group (12.3 ± 1.0 weeks). Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that OFM-treated VLUs had a significantly greater probability of healing (up to ~40%). This RWE comparative efficacy study further substantiates the clinical benefit of OFM in the treatment of chronic wounds, such as VLU, in a real-world patient cohort.",

Collagen (COL)/V2C Aluminium Carbide (V2CTx) composite aerogels were synthesized using a simple method of blending and directional freezing-drying with original materials of COL and V2CTx, in which V2CTx MXene was prepared by etching V2AlC with hydrofluoric acid under stirring at room temperature. Modern testing and analysis techniques were used to characterize the structural properties and surface morphology of the hybrid aerogel. The COL/V2CTx composite aerogel shows excellent mechanical properties with 83 kPa compressive stress at 70% strain, low density (about 25 mg/cm3), outstanding thermal stability with 58.67% weight loss from 240℃ to 600℃ and thermal insulation with heat conductivity coefficient 0.05304 W/mK. Importantly, COL/V2CTx aerogel exhibits higher oil absorption capacity and stability than that of COL aerogel for various oils. The absorbency of COL/V2CTx aerogel for methylene chloride is up to 54 times its weight under Vander Waals forces, intermolecular interaction, and capillary interaction between the aerogel and oily liquids. Therefore, COL/V2CTx aerogel possesses a promising application in the field of oil absorption and wastewater treatment.HIGHLIGHTSA novel COL/V2CTx aerogel was prepared by a simple method of blending and directional freezing-drying.The absorption capacity of COL/V2CTx aerogel for methylene chloride achieves up to 54 times its weight.The COL/V2CTx composite aerogel exhibits excellent mechanical properties with 83 kPa compressive stress at 70% strain, low density (about 25 mg/cm3), and good thermal stability with 58.67% weight loss from 240℃ to 600℃."

      "abstract": "Fibrotic diseases are involved in 45% of deaths in the United States. In particular, fibrosis of the kidney and lung are major public health concerns due to their high prevalence and lack of existing treatment options. Here, we harness the pathophysiological features of fibrotic diseases, namely leaky vasculature and aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein deposition (i.e. collagen), to target an anti-fibrotic biologic and a small molecule drug to disease sites of fibrosis, thus improving the therapeutic potential of both the biologic and small molecule in mouse models of both lung and kidney fibrosis. First, we identify and validate two collagen-targeting drug delivery systems that preferentially accumulate in fibrotic organs: von Willebrand Factor's A3 domain (VWF-A3) and decorin-derived collagen-binding peptide-conjugated micelles (CBP-micelles). We then engineer and recombinantly express novel candidate biologic therapies based on the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10: A3-IL-10 and A3-Serum Albumin-IL-10 (A3-SA-IL-10). Simultaneously, we stably encapsulate the potential anti-fibrotic water-insoluble drug, rapamycin, in CBP-micelles. We show that these novel formulations of therapeutics bind to collagen in vitro and that their efficacy in mouse models of lung and kidney fibrosis is improved, compared to free, untargeted drugs. Our results demonstrate that collagen-targeted anti-fibrotic drugs may be next generation therapies of high clinical potential.",

Twenty-eight 8-week-old male Dark Agouti rats were immunized with type II collagen and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (day 0). From days 14 to 28, 18 rats received B-SES (50 Hz) four times only on the right hindlimb (STIM), while the contralateral left hindlimb remained unstimulated. Both hindlimbs of 10 untreated CIA rats were defined as controls (CONT). Paw volume was measured every other day. On day 28, the muscle weight, histology, and gene expression of the soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were analyzed. B-SES did not worsen paw volume throughout the experimental period. Compared with CONT, the muscle weight and fiber cross-sectional area of the soleus were higher in STIM. The expression of muscle degradation markers (atrogin-1 and MuRF-1) in the soleus and EDL was lower in the STIM group than that in the CONT group. In contrast, B-SES did not significantly affect the expression of muscle synthesis (Eif4e and p70S6K) and mitochondrial (PGC-1α) markers. B-SES prevents muscle atrophy in CIA rats by reducing muscle degradation without exacerbating arthritis, demonstrating its promising potential as an intervention for RA-induced muscle atrophy.",

In this study, we aimed to address these limitations by developing a novel approach leveraging genetically engineered human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) to synthesize human cell-derived BMP-2 (hBMP-2) within a collagen-based bone graft matrix. ARPE-19 cells were transduced using a lentiviral vector encoding BMP-2 and subsequently cultured in a porcine-collagen mixed graft material. The efficacy of this hBMP-2-enriched graft was evaluated in a rat calvaria defect model over 6 weeks, with comparisons made against empty defects and grafts lacking hBMP-2. Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed improved bone regeneration parameters in the hBMP-2 group compared with those in the graft-only group, although statistical significance was limited to the trabecular number, which approached borderline significance (p < 0.1). Histological analysis corroborated these findings, revealing significantly enhanced new bone formation but only a reducing tendency of residual graft material in the hBMP-2 group. This study presents a promising approach for bone regeneration by utilizing genetically engineered human cells to produce BMP-2 within clinically available bone graft materials, potentially mitigating the high-dose requirements and associated complications of conventional BMP-2 therapies.",

On days 0, 7, 14, and 30, the rats were terminated, and the membranes and surrounding tissues were collected for analysis. A histological examination was performed to evaluate the membrane biodegradation rate, the number of blood vessels formed, and the inflammatory response.The data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests, with a p-value of < 0.05 considered statistically significant.The collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane remained in the tissue up to day 30, while the pericardial membrane and cross-linked pericardial membrane were completely degraded by day 7. The average number of new blood vessels formed in the collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane on days 7, 14, and 30 was greater than that in the pericardial membrane and cross-linked pericardial membrane, which was statistically significant (p < 0.005). The average number of inflammatory cells in the collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane on day 30 was lower than that in the pericardial membrane and cross-linked pericardial membrane, which was statistically significant (p < 0.005) for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) for eosinophils and mast cells.Biodegradation, angiogenesis, and the inflammatory response in collagen-chitosan-PVA membranes showed better results compared with other membranes. Collagen-chitosan-PVA membranes exhibit potential for application in guided tissue regeneration treatment for periodontal disease."

METHODS: A total of 23 eyes of 18 patients with progressive keratoconus, that were treated with epithelium-off pulsed light aCXL (30 mW/cm2, 8 min) were included in this retrospective study. Tomographic measurements and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were analyzed at the baseline visit (before the aCXL treatment), and at 3-, 12- and 24-months visit. RESULTS: The two-year results demonstrated a stable anterior flat keratometry (K1), steep keratometry (K2) and mean keratometry (Kmean) of the anterior and posterior cornea with no significant changes at 3, 12 and 24 months postoperatively, compared to the baseline visit (p > 0.05). Maximal anterior keratometry (Kmax) stabilized from 60.18 ± 6.32 D at baseline to 60.04 ± 7.36 D at 24 months post-aCXL (p = 0.88). The keratoconus indices and astigmatism of the front and back surface of the cornea also showed stable results. The CDVA improved from 0.69 ± 0.29 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) at baseline to 0.35 ± 0.21 logMAR at 24 months postoperatively (p = 0.16). CONCLUSION: Pulsed light epithelium-off accelerated CXL using 30 mW/cm2 for 8 min (7.2 J/cm2) appears to be an effective treatment modality halting progression of keratoconus even after two years.",

Undenatured chicken collagen type II (NK2) is considered safe and effective for maintaining joint health and can be used alone and combined with drugs for OA treatment. AIM: To further evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Artneo containing NK2 in patients with stage III knee OA compared with placebo in a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 212 patients from 12 centers in the Russian Federation, of whom 50 had radiological stage III knee OA: 41 (82.0%) females and 9 (18.0%) males aged 44 to 75. Using the interactive web response system (IWRS), the study population was randomized into two groups: Group 1 (Artneo group) included 28 patients receiving the drug 1 capsule once a day for 180 days, Group 2 (placebo group) included 22 patients receiving placebo with drug-matched presentation and the same regimen as in Group 1. The effectiveness of therapy was assessed by the change of pain using the Visual Analog Scale, the WOMAC index, KOOS, the EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire, and the need for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. All patients had a complete blood count, urinalysis, blood chemistry, and ultrasonic examination of the target knee joint. RESULTS: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial demonstrated that Artneo containing NK2 was significantly superior to placebo in all studied parameters, improved all clinical manifestations of OA: reduced pain and stiffness, improved joint function and quality of life, and had a good safety profile. CONCLUSION: Artneo showed high efficacy and safety in the general population of patients, including those with stage III knee OA.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Down syndrome is one of the strongest risk factors of keratoconus. Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) is the standard-of-care treatment to reduce progression, but there is limited published literature about CXL in patients with Down syndrome. We sought to describe outcomes of epithelium-off CXL under general anesthesia in patients with Down syndrome and keratoconus. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive case series at a single tertiary pediatric hospital. Standard epithelium-off Dresden protocol CXL under general anesthesia was performed in all cases. Preoperative and postoperative corneal characteristics were obtained. All perioperative and postoperative complications were reported. RESULTS: Between August 2020 and February 2024, CXL was performed on 34 eyes of 20 patients with Down syndrome. The mean age was 20.2 years at the time of crosslinking. The mean preoperative Kmax was 62.3 diopters (range 45.5-95.4), with a mean preoperative central corneal thickness of 466 μm (range 306-538). Visual acuity post procedure in patients seen 1 week postoperatively was stable to improved. One eye developed corneal edema that resolved within 3 weeks postoperatively, and another was found to have new apical scarring a year after the procedure. No other complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Keratoconus was diagnosed at an advanced stage in most of the patients with Down syndrome in our cohort. Epithelium-off CXL under general anesthesia was well tolerated. Though follow-up was limited, our results suggest that CXL is feasible and effective in keratoconus associated with Down syndrome."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Keloids are severe dermal fibrotic disorders caused by excessive deposition of collagen. Current therapies have high recurrence rates, and there is a high clinical need for a new fundamental approach. We focused on inhibiting proline, an essential amino acid for collagen biosynthesis. We developed DWN12088, a drug that downregulates prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS), an enzyme involved in proline ligation with its tRNA. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of this drug on keloids. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the anti-fibrotic activity of selective PRS inhibitors and elucidated the importance of DWN12088 as a first-in-class therapeutic agent for keloids. METHODS: Patient-derived keloid fibroblasts (KFs) and keloid tissues were obtained to observe the upregulation of PRS. In addition, the anti-fibrotic activity of selective PRS inhibitors was studied using KFs, and their treatment efficacy was further validated in vivo using a KF xenograft severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mouse model. Histological and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed with human-derived keloid tissues. Additional experiments included immunocytochemistry, cell viability analysis, migration analysis, and western blotting on KFs. Human KFs were injected into SCID mice to study the nodule formation and histological characteristics. RESULTS: Compared to normal fibroblasts and normal skin tissues, PRS was overexpressed in both KF and keloid tissues. A selective PRS inhibitor downregulated fibrotic markers, reduced migration capacity, and lowered collagen production in KFs. In a KF xenograft SCID mouse model, a selective PRS inhibitor effectively suppressed keloid formation and mitigated inflammation and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: DWN12088, a selective PRS inhibitor, may be a novel first-in-class treatment modality that effectively prevents keloid development. Further clinical trials are required to verify the safety and clinical efficacy of PRS inhibitors for keloids. We believe that our study has applicability across several fibrotic wound problems such as hypertrophic scars."

Hence, a total 30 patient's diagnosed with OSMF were alienated equally into 3 groups based on treatment method; Group I: buccal pad of fat (BPF), Group II: mucosal defect with amniotic membrane (AM) and Group III-xenogenous collagen membrane (CM). Results show that AM grafts are advisable alternative for oral tissue restoration than buccal fat pad flaps and collagen membranes in terms of discomfort reduction, mouth opening improvement and epithelisation."

Typically, hADSCs are utilized in cellular aggregates or hydrogels to enhance therapeutic efficacy. However, limitations such as reduced cell viability, inadequate mass transfer rates, and diminished paracrine effects hinder their clinical applications. This study explores an innovative approach by encapsulating hADSCs within a collagen/hyaluronic acid micro-fragmented collagen hydrogel wound dressing (MCWD). The resulting micro-fragmented collagen hydrogel-hADSC composite created through the integration of micro-sized hydrogel units and cells demonstrated markedly improved cell viability and activity, as well as superior therapeutic outcomes compared to conventional cell aggregates (CA) and collagen hydrogel wound dressings (CWD). In vitro assessments showed that the highly porous structure of MCWD promotes better mass transfer and enhances the viability and cytokine production of hADSCs associated with the paracrine effect. In vivo experiments further validated the effectiveness of the MCWD, revealing significant enhancements in cell proliferation, skin thickness restoration, collagen maturation, and blood vessel formation. These findings underscore the potential of MCWD as an advanced solution for wound healing applications."

OEA is known as an anti-inflammatory lipid and acts as an endogenous ligand for GPR119. This study investigated the functional roles of GPR119 using a murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. The effects of OEA and AR231453, a selective synthetic GPR119 agonist, were tested on the CIA model in Gpr119 wild-type (WT) and deficient DBA-1 J mice. In the CIA model, administration of OEA or AR231453 reduced arthritis scores, foot thickness, loss of proteoglycan, and bone erosion in Gpr119 WT mice, but not in Gpr119-deficient mice. Treatment with OEA or AR231453 significantly suppressed the CIA-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the feet and IgG levels in the serum, and rebalanced Th1/Th17 and Treg cells in the spleens of Gpr119 WT mice, but not in Gpr119-deficient mice. Additionally, OEA and AR231453 suppressed mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in human SW982 synovial cells. Both compounds also suppressed Th1/17 cell differentiation and enhanced Treg differentiation in splenocytes from Gpr119 WT mice, but not in Gpr119 knockout mice. These findings suggest that GPR119 activation may serve as a therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis by regulating Th1/Th17/Treg cell differentiation and rebalancing Th1/Th17 and Treg cells.",

A collagen peptide-based composite human hair repair emulsion (CHFRE) was formulated, and its repair efficacy on damaged hair (DH) was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and amino acid analysis. Following CHFRE treatment, the physical and chemical properties of damaged hair improved significantly. SEM analysis revealed enhanced hair luster, aligned cuticle scales, and a denser cortex. FTIR and DSC analyses showed a 5.94% increase in α-conformation content and a 28.44% rise in relative helical content (RHC), indicating enhanced protein stability and a conformation closer to that of normal hair. Additionally, the 14.63% increase in S=O transmittance suggested reduced oxidative damage. Amino acid analysis and hydrophobic amino acids, with specific increments of 16.77 g/100 g and 2.47 g/100 g, respectively, enhance hair affinity and keratin stability. This bio-based repair material effectively restores damaged hair structure, strengthens resistance to chemical damage, and ensures sustainability, safety, and biocompatibility, providing a promising approach for the development of natural hair repair products."

Despite their potential, stem cell therapy remains constrained by various limitations, including low differentiation efficiency, difficulties in guiding differentiation, proliferation control, shorter half-life of growth factors, experimental reproducibility, etc. The cellular niche environment is pivotal in effective differentiation of stem cells. Neural regeneration ventures require biomaterial-based 3D scaffolds to simulate in-vivo tissue to solve the niche environment problem. Recent breakthroughs in neural regeneration have led to the development of a biomimetic scaffolds made of Hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen (COL) that imitate the CNS's extracellular matrix (ECM) for better neural regeneration and repair. HA and COL based scaffold creates a favourable microenvironment for cellular migration, proliferation and survival of the embedded stem cells and promotes neural regeneration. HA regulates cellular activities while COL contributes in healing CNS injuries. Therefore, the utilization of HA-COL based scaffolds is appropriate for regulating cellular responses and behaviour for neural regeneration. This review investigates the synergy between HA and COL in the context of neural-specific applications for repair, regeneration, and recovery as well as augmentation of bioactivity through fabrication techniques such as 3D bioprinting, electrospinning, etc. for neural tissue regeneration."

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to elucidate heat-induced collagen-triglyceride complex formation (25 °C, 47 °C, 64 °C, 75 °C, and 79 °C), identify pyrazine-binding residues, and assess implications for flavor retention strategies. METHODS: An in vitro collagen-triglyceride-pyrazine model was developed. Complex formation was validated via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), while heating-induced structural changes were analyzed through rheology, fluorescence spectroscopy, and XRD. Molecular docking quantified binding energies and dynamics. RESULTS: Heating stabilized the collagen-triglyceride complexes via hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and covalent bonds (zeta potential: -12.75 to -5.53 mV), showing high affinity for 2-ethyl-5-methyl and 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethyl pyrazines. Molecular docking revealed GLU-A-12, HYP-B-7, and PHE-C-9 as key residues, destabilizing hydrogen networks but enhancing thermal stability. CONCLUSION: The integration of multi-scale analyses clarifies collagen-lipid-flavor interactions in flavor retention, providing valuable theoretical support for optimizing roasting technologies."

Further progress is hampered by an incomplete understanding of how oncotropic bacteria, such as attenuated strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, colonise tumours and the responses of both the bacteria and tumour cells to this colonisation. To model this, we developed organoids that are permissive for bacterial colonisation, replacing the conventional commercially available extracellular matrix (e.g., Matrigel) with a type I collagen matrix scaffold. A comparison of the two extracellular matrices indicated that type 1 collagen permitted an initial infection efficiency more than 5-times greater than with Matrigel. In addition, subsequent growth within type 1 collagen expanded bacterial cell numbers by over 10-fold within 4 days of infection. These organoids allow for the visualisation of bacterial chemoattraction, cell invasion and subsequent population of the interior lumen, and will permit the future optimisation of BCT. In addition, by establishing patient-derived organoids, we demonstrate a platform for developing future personalised treatments exploiting BCT.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The self-healing capacity of a damaged annulus fibrosus (AF) leads to intervertebral disk (IVD) degeneration. AF wound treatment is challenging. The combination of biomaterials and stem cell-derived exosomes is a promising wound treatment strategy with significant clinical value. Methods: We isolate primary nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and primary annulus fibrosus cells (AFCs) from rats as the target cells of rat insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF1), and verify the proliferation and migration; constructed cartilage endplate stem cells (CESCs) engineered cells that release exosomes containing high concentrations of IGF1by lentiviral infection, and used the IGF1-CESCs combined with combined silk fibroin (SF) and a collagen-mixed hydrogel for the treatment of AF wounds in rat. Results: We found that both IGF1 and IGF1-rich exosomes (IGF1 Exo) promoted the proliferation and migration of AFCs. SF and collagen mixed hydrogels have excellent compressive mechanical properties and are suitable for use in IVD therapy. After the IGF1-CESCs@SF-collagen hydrogel was filled in the damaged area of the AF in rat, the wound healing was accelerated, nucleus pulposus overflow was inhibited, the IVD height was maintained, and degeneration was reduced. Discussion: The IGF1-CESCs@SF-collagen hydrogel can efficiently treat AF wounds and inhibit degeneration of IVD, and has potential for clinical treatment."

      "abstract": "UVR-related skin damage is common in daily life. Excessive sunlight exposure, particularly in response to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, can have adverse effects on the skin and can even induce photosensitive skin diseases and skin malignancies. UVB exposure leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the skin, resulting in cell damage and inflammation. Furthermore, it directly inhibits the synthesis of collagen in skin fibroblasts, contributing to collagen degradation and subsequently causing skin aging, wrinkles, and erythema. To address this issue, our study introduces a biomaterial-based treatment plan for repairing UVB-induced photodamaged skin. We designed a sodium hyaluronate microneedle patch containing a hardystonite bioceramic (ZnCS/MN) with anti-ROS/inflammation/collagen degradation functions to deliver bioactive Zn2+ and SiO3 2- ions in situ to photodamaged skin areas. In addition, the cytological mechanism of ZnCS action was explored to explore the possibilities of its application in more areas. This study reveals the therapeutic potential of ZnCS for a variety of negative effects caused by photodamage. Owing to its advantages in preparation, storage, and transportation, ZnCS/MN has shown promise for clinical application in treating photodamaging."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The present study aimed to determine whether hyperbaric oxygenation increases intrastromal oxygen concentration during accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) and whether this enhances CXL effects. METHODS: Oxygen concentration was measured in porcine corneas during epithelium-off CXL with UV-A intensity of 9 mW/cm2 for 10 minutes. Experiments were performed under normobaric and hyperbaric (2.4 bar) conditions, with and without supplemental oxygen. Stromal resistance to lysis by collagenase A and biomechanical changes were measured. RESULTS: Oxygen concentrations before irradiation averaged 11% in the normobaric group (CXLnorm), 37% in the normobaric group with supplemental oxygen (CXLnorm + O2), 13% in the hyperbaric group (CXLhyp), and 43% in the hyperbaric group with supplemental oxygen (CXLhyp + O2). After the onset of UV-A, oxygen concentration decreased to 1.5% in CXLnorm, 3% in CXLhyp, 21% in CXLnorm + O2, and 38% in CXLhyp + O2. Differences between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Corneal lenticules from the CXLhyp + O2 group were completely digested by collagenase after 5.4 days (standard deviation = 1.34). This was significantly later (P < 0.05) than in other groups. Biomechanical testing did not reveal meaningful differences between the treatment protocols. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that hyperbaric oxygenation increases intrastromal oxygen in porcine corneas, ensuring constant availability during accelerated CXL. This leads to enhanced resistance to collagenase digestion of anterior corneal stroma. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: More intrastromal oxygen and resistance to proteolytic enzymes may make CXL with hyperbaric oxygenation an improved treatment for progressive keratoconus and (infectious) corneal ulcers.",

Patients were identified by MACI lot number and surgery date. Adverse events were summarized with descriptive statistics. Group differences were assessed with t-tests and chi-square, with significance set at P < 0.05.ResultsFive thousand adults (5,198 knees) were implanted with MACI by 1,130 surgeons. Patient sex (male 49.2%) was evenly split, and the mean age was 33.6 years. Most patients had a single cartilage defect treated, and the mean defect size was 4.4 cm2. The patella was the most treated surface (38.4%), followed by the medial femoral condyle (25.7%). Most patients (85.5%) had concomitant surgical procedures at the time of cartilage biopsy procurement. There were statistically significant differences in the number of patella (P < 0.001), medial femoral condyle (P < 0.001), and \"not specified\" (P = 0.008) between groups. Mean defect size and mean total defect size were both larger (P < 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) in the subsequent 5,000 patients.ConclusionThe utilization of MACI has remained consistent. Patient demographics and concomitant surgical procedures between the first 1,000 MACI patients and subsequent 5,000 MACI patients were comparable. Patellofemoral defects were the most treated in both subsets, and an overall low rate of adverse events was observed."

Effective regeneration remains challenging due to limited material bioactivity and inadequate consideration of mechanical cues. This study develops a hydrogel integrating human extracellular matrix-like collagen (hCol) derived from induced human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) with hyaluronic acid (HA) and polyethylene glycol diamine (PEGDA), engineered to achieve a modulus (≈1 kPa) representative of subcutaneous soft tissue. The hCol, produced at scale, provides essential biochemical signals, which, in conjunction with the hydrogel mechanical properties, synergistically modulate immune responses, cellular differentiation, and anti-aging processes. Both animal experiments and clinical trials validate the regenerative efficacy of the hydrogels. Clinical regeneration therapy for mandibular retrognathia shows rapid and sustained improvements, with repair efficacy rates of 95.2% at 3 months and 76.2% at 6 months.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The dynamic evolution of collagen fibers during wound healing is crucial for assessing repair progression, guiding clinical treatment, and drug screening. Current quantitative methods analyzing collagen spatial patterns (density, orientation variance) lack established criteria to both stratify distinct healing periods and detect delayed healing conditions, necessitating the establishment of a novel classification method for wound healing status based on collagen fibers. METHODS: We propose a deep learning method to classify various time points of wound healing and delayed healing using histological images of skin tissue. We fine-tune a pre-trained VGG16 model and enhance it with an interpretable framework that combines LayerCAM and Guided Backpropagation, leveraging model gradients and features to visually identify the tissue regions driving model predictions. RESULTS: Our model achieved 85 % accuracy in a five-class classification task (normal skin, wound skin at 0, 3, 7, and 10 days) and 78 % in a three-class task (normal skin, wound skin at 0 days, diabetic wound skin at 10 days). Our interpretable framework accurately localizes collagen fibers without pixel-level annotations, demonstrating that our model classifies healing periods and delayed healing based on collagen regions in histological images rather than other less relevant tissue structures. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning method leverages collagen fiber features to predict various time points of wound healing and delayed healing with high accuracy and visual interpretability, enhancing doctors' trust in model decisions. This could lead to more precise and effective wound treatment practices.",

      "abstract": "Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) is a prevalent complication arising from uterine surgery, significantly impacting women's fertility and overall quality of life. The conventional clinical approach involves hysteroscopic separation of uterine adhesions, though this method poses operational challenges and carries risks of postoperative re-adhesion. Alternatively, the intraoperative placement of intrauterine devices or support balloons can act as a physical barrier to prevent adhesion formation. However, its effectiveness is limited and it may result in secondary damage to the endothelial tissue. To tackle these challenges, we have engineered a temperature-responsive hydrogel incorporating Pluronic HP407/HP188 pharmaceutical excipients and recombinant type III collagen (rCol III) as a bioactive element. Upon in situ injection into the uterine cavity, this hydrogel transitions from a sol-gel phase to a gel in response to body temperature changes, thereby minimizing nonspecific distribution and prolonging the duration of treatment. In vitro studies demonstrate that rCol III temperature-responsive hydrogels exhibit favorable biocompatibility, exhibit a recruitment effect on human endometrial stromal cells, suppress the expression of the fibrotic factor transforming growth factor beta 1 and promote angiogenesis. To evaluate its efficacy in preventing IUA via in vivo experiments, we employed sexually mature female rats for IUA modeling and compared its performance with a commercially available product, cross-linked sodium hyaluronate gel. The results indicate that rCol III temperature-responsive hydrogels significantly enhance retention at the injury site, substantially promote endometrial regeneration, augment endometrial blood supply and reduce abnormal fibrin deposition. This study suggests that rCol III temperature-responsive hydrogels can effectively prevent post-surgical uterine adhesions, highlighting their potential as a promising adhesion prevention strategy."

METHODS: In this prospective observational study with a 1-year follow-up, 60 patients aged 16-26 years (60 eyes) with keratoconus were assigned to two groups: the epithelium-off ACXL group (30 patients, 30 eyes) and the transepithelial ACXL group (30 patients, 30 eyes). Patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment. The measurements included visual acuity, corneal parameters, and corneal endothelium parameters. Baseline data and treatment effect were compared using the t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Within-group comparisons used paired t-tests or paired rank-sum tests. RESULTS: At 12 months postoperatively, the treatment groups showed statistically significant differences in central corneal thickness (IOLMaster), thinnest point corneal thickness (topography), thickness (topography), central corneal thickness, corneal thickness on optical coherence tomography, deformation amplitude (DA), first applanation time, first applanation velocity, second applanation time, second applanation velocity, peak distance (PD), high-contrast acuity, stiffness parameter at the first applanation, and comprehensive refraction (p < 0.001). No differences were observed between the groups in any other parameters before or after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both epithelium-off and transepithelial ACXL effectively treat keratoconus. Transepithelial ACXL is slightly inferior to epithelium-off ACXL in maximum corneal curvature but superior in improving corneal thickness and DA parameters. Further studies are necessary to verify the efficacy, safety, and long-term stability of transepithelial ACXL in treating keratoconus."

      "abstract": "Collagen is a key protein in mammals that maintains structural integrity within tissues. A failure in fibrillar collagen reorganization can induce cancer or fibrosis formation, such as in spinal cord injury (SCI), where the healing process after the initial trauma leads to the formation of scar tissue, which includes fibrosis. As there is no current treatment targeting the fibrotic process directly, a better understanding of collagen properties can thus help to apprehend malignant states. Characterization of collagen fibers has been widely explored on second-harmonic generation (SHG) images, due to the label-free nature of the SHG imaging technique. It has been performed with various fibers extraction methods such as curvelet transform (CT) implemented in the open-source software CurveAlign. However, when it comes to investigating undergrowth collagen fibers (collagen fibers that are still under reorganization) as observed in SCI, the CT method becomes complex to tune for nonadvanced users in order to properly segment the fibers. To improve collagen detection in the case of undergrowth fibers, we propose a methodology based on the fingerprint enhancement (FP-E) algorithm that requires fewer user input parameters and is less time-consuming. Our method was extensively tested on SHG data from injured spinal cord samples. We obtained metrics that depicted changes in collagen organization over time, particularly a significant increase in fiber density, demonstrating the FP-E algorithm was properly adapted to address the evolution of collagen properties after SCI. Besides the simpler tuning of the method compared to commonly used software, the combination with further characterization of the extracted fibers could lead to consider fibrillar collagen as a biomarker in diseases where fibers are under development. The FP-E algorithm is provided in the article.",

METHODOLOGY: The patients in the control group received clinical treatment with entecavir monotherapy, while those in the observation group underwent thymalfasin + entecavir combination therapy. The clinical curative effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors at different concentrations on diseases were compared from all aspects. RESULTS: There were lower levels of total bilirubin (TBIL) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in the observation group, a more satisfactory improvement in immune function-related indicators, and lower levels of HA, LN, and IVC in the observation group, which were statistically different between the two groups (P<0.05). The levels of liver function indicators, immune function-related indicators (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+, CD4+/CD8+), and HA, LN and IVC were not statistically different between the two groups before treatment. CONCLUSION: Entecavir is highly effective in the clinical treatment of HBeAG-positive chronic hepatitis B. However, entecavir + thymalfasin combination therapy can alleviate the clinical symptoms. In this way, liver fibrosis can be prevented in patients with HBeAG-positive chronic hepatitis B, and the clinical curative effect can be enhanced.",

Remdesivir also had anti-inflammatory effect which reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and inhibition of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-STING pathway. METHODS: We evaluated the antiarthritic effects of remdesivir in a mouse model of High-fat diet (HFD) collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with RA. Type II collagen was administered to DBA/1J mice to induce CIA. Vehicle or remdesivir was injected subcutaneously three times a week. During 7 weeks of treatment, the arthritis score and incidence were evaluated twice a week. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging were used to evaluate CD4 + T cells in the spleen. FLSs from patients with RA were stimulated in vitro with remdesivir and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and western blotting was used to measure the expression of STING and necroptosis-related markers. RESULTS: Remdesivir administration suppressed the incidence and progression of arthritis in mice with CIA. Histological analysis revealed lower inflammation and cartilage damage scores in remdesivir-treated than in vehicle groups. Interleukin (IL)-17 + CD4 + T-cell differentiation was inhibited in the remdesivir-treated group. Furthermore, IL-17/-6/-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein -1, and TNF-α expression was reduced in the remdesivir group. In vitro, remdesivir suppressed the expression of STING, nuclear factor-κB, RIPK3, and phosphorylated MLKL in RA-FLSs under TNF-α stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The antiviral agent remdesivir suppressed arthritis by regulating Th cell differentiation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, the STING pathway, and necroptosis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Collagens are widely studied proteins given their implications in the skin extracellular matrix and pathological conditions such as fibrosis. Type V collagen is a member of the fibrillar collagens, and three different polypeptide chains, α1, α2 and α3 form isoforms through associations. The third chain, α3, of type V collagen was initially identified in the placenta, but after decades, it remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression and localization of the α3 chain of type V collagen in the skin and its evolution during skin aging. The identification of α3(V) collagen as a target of retinoic acid and its interaction with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was investigated. METHODS: The expression and localization of α3(V) collagen were assessed by immunodetection in ex vivo skin and in keratinocytes using a calcium-differentiated model. The variation in α3(V) collagen expression during aging was studied in ex vivo skin from donors of different ages. The modulation of α3(V) collagen by retinoic acid was investigated by qPCR in keratinocytes and by immunofluorescence in ex vivo skin biopsies. Silencing of α3(V) collagen was performed using siRNA. The expression of MMP-9 was investigated using qPCR. RESULTS: In our study, we showed that α3(V) collagen was abundantly produced by basal skin keratinocytes and in the outer root sheath of the hair. α3(V) collagen expression appears to decrease with age in the skin and in differentiated keratinocytes. We also identified that treatment of keratinocytes and ex vivo skin biopsies with retinoic acid induced α3(V) collagen expression. Finally, we showed that inhibition of α3(V) collagen in keratinocytes led to an increase in MMP-9 expression. CONCLUSION: This study provides a better understanding of α3(V) collagen expression and localization in the skin. These findings suggest that α3(V) collagen could contribute to the therapeutic and anti-aging value of retinoic acid on the skin and may open new prospects. Finally, our data shed more light on the functional relationship between α3(V) collagen and MMP-9, opening possibilities for anti-aging and eczema treatments."

      "abstract": "Timely intervention during the predysplastic or dysplastic stages of red and white lesions is crucial for preventing their progression to oral carcinoma. Following surgical removal, a soft tissue deficit area is created. Surgical excision of these lesions often leads to a mucosal defect. These residual defects can be concealed with skin grafts, mucosal grafts, or xenografts. In this paper, we describe collagen sheets as an excellent reconstruction option, particularly after the loss of soft tissue due to resection of red and white lesions with histologically verified dysplastic features."

      "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by dense collagen and mucus barriers that significantly limit drug delivery to the lungs. Clearing the collagen barrier can enhance drug delivery efficiency. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of collagen states among patients poses a challenge. Therefore, real-time monitoring of the collagen clearance status is essential for PF personalized therapy. Herein, sequential theranostic platforms are proposed for collagen targeting and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring to guide small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery. First, for collagen barrier targeting-degrading, collagenase is conjugated with a collagen-targeting peptide capable of chelating the MRI contrast agent Gd(III), forming Col I T-D. This allows real-time, noninvasive MRI monitoring of the dynamic collagen clearance process. Second, guided by MRI, the zwitterionic polymer-based siRNA vectors (siTGF-β1@TZ) with mucus-penetrating and fibroblast-targeting capabilities are inhaled under an optimal state of collagen barrier. The sequential application of Col I T-D and siTGF-β1@TZ demonstrates significant lesion enrichment and therapeutic efficacy in PF treatment. Collectively, this study provides a novel perspective on dynamically monitoring collagen clearance status and guiding the sequential delivery of siRNA, offering a promising strategy for personalized PF therapy.",

METHODS: Thirty-two biopsy samples from eight clinically healthy adult male New Zealand rabbits were used. They were treated with aPRP, RSV, or aPRP + RSV and analyzed zero, three, seven, ten, and 14 days post wound induction. RESULTS: Type I collagen immunoexpression was significantly higher in wounds treated with aPRP when compared to the control group. This study demonstrated that type III collagen is predominant during the proliferation phase of the healing process, highlighting its critical role in tissue repair and regeneration. CONCLUSION: The association of aPRP and RSV in wound treatment may have an additive effect in the immunoexpression of type III collagen and can thus be used as an alternative in tissue repair and collagen formation, optimizing the healing process.",

      "abstract": "At present, there is a significant population of individuals experiencing bone deficiencies caused by injuries, ailments affecting the bones, congenital abnormalities, and cancer. The management of substantial bone defects a significant global orthopedic challenge due to the intricacies involved in promoting and restoring the growth of fresh osseous tissue. Autografts are widely regarded as the \"gold standard\" for repairing bone defects because of their superior tissue acceptance and ability to control osteogenesis. However, patients undergoing autografts may encounter various challenges, including but not limited to hernia, bleeding, nerve impairment, tissue death. Therefore, researchers in regenerative medicine are striving to find alternatives. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, and its triple helix structure gives it unique characteristics that contribute to its strength and functionality in various tissues. Collagen is commonly processed into various forms such as scaffolds, sponges, membranes, hydrogels, and composite materials, due to its unique compatibility with the human body, affinity for water, minimal potential for immune reactions, adaptability, and ability to transport nutrients or drugs. As an alternative material in the field of bone regeneration, collagen is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the primary types and sources of collagen, their processes of synthesis and degradation, as well as the advancements made in bone regeneration research and its potential applications. A comprehensive investigation into the role of collagen in bone regeneration is undertaken, providing valuable points of reference for a more profound comprehension of collagen applications in this field. The concluding section provides a comprehensive overview of the prospective avenues for collagen research, underscoring their promising future and highlighting their significant potential in the field of bone regeneration. The Translational Potential of this Article. The comprehensive exploration into the diverse functions and translational potential of collagen in bone regeneration, as demonstrated in this review, these findings underscore their promising potential as a treatment option with significant clinical implications, thus paving the way for innovative and efficacious therapeutic strategies in this domain."

      "abstract": "The current challenge in developing wound healing dressings lies in achieving antibacterial effects while avoiding cytotoxicity to cells that are crucial for the healing process. Addressing this challenge, Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (ZIF-67), a cobalt-containing metal-organic framework (MOF), has emerged as a promising additive due to cobalt's broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects. This study developed semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) hydrogels by incorporating 1-3 wt.% ZIF-67 into collagen-guar gum matrices, resulting in biocomposites with tunable structural and functional properties. These biocomposites exhibit a fibrillar-granular morphology, uniform cobalt ion distribution on a semi-crystalline surface, and strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli). At 3 wt.%, ZIF-67 accelerates gelation, strengthens crosslinking interactions, and enhances the storage modulus, thermal stability, and hydrolytic resistance of the hydrogels. Furthermore, biocomposites with 1 wt.% ZIF-67 also function as in-situ curcumin delivery systems, offering controlled release under physiological conditions and significant biodegradation in the presence of collagenase. In vitro tests demonstrate that the chemical composition of these hydrogels, regardless of ZIF-67 content, effectively supports monocyte and fibroblast metabolic activity, promotes cell proliferation, and increases interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion by human monocytes. Additionally, the absence of hemolytic effects in human blood further underscores the safety and suitability of these hydrogel biocomposites for advanced wound treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Objective Dermal matrices are commonly used to manage full-thickness wounds, impacting both functional and aesthetic outcomes. However, standard materials typically require 14-28 days to develop sufficient tissue for autografting. This study aimed to assess the potential of a novel bovine dermal collagen matrix (BDCM) to decrease the time required to develop tissue for autografting for accelerating the timeline for definitive wound closure. Methods Full-thickness excisional wounds were surgically created on Yorkshire pigs and treated with crosslinked collagen-based dermal matrices, including a bovine dermal collagen matrix (BDCM; Cohealyx, Collagen Matrix Inc., Oakland, NJ), a collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrix (ColGAG; Integra Bilayer Wound Matrix, Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ), or a fish skin graft matrix (FSG; Kerecis Graft Guide, Isafjorour, Iceland). Seven days after application, matrix attachment and infection status were assessed, along with histological analyses of cellular infiltration, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis. The wound beds were then autografted and monitored for an additional 35 days to evaluate wound healing parameters, including skin graft take, re-epithelialization, and wound contraction. Results Seven days post-autografting, autograft take was 96.88 ± 7.04% for BDCM-treated wounds compared to 85.00 ± 34.10% and 68.00 ± 27.97% for ColGAG and FSG-treated wounds, respectively. The coefficient of variation was 7% for BDCM-treated wounds compared to approximately 40% for ColGAG and FSG-treated wounds. Histological analysis revealed that BDCM-treated wounds contained a persisting collagen scaffold that allowed cellular infiltration and angiogenesis with no infection. At 42 days, BDCM showed significantly less wound contraction (p<0.05) compared to the other dermal matrix-treated wounds. Conclusion Bovine dermal collagen matrix enables rapid cellular infiltration and vascularized tissue deposition, supporting highly consistent autograft take at seven days. The possibility of reducing time to definitive closure has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes of acute full-thickness wounds and lower the overall cost of treatment."

However, the most commonly used collagen barrier membranes usually have poor mechanical properties and are prone to collapse during clinical use. Herein, a sandwich-like barrier membrane was developed with crosslinked chitosan as dense layer, crosslinked collagen as loose layer and passivated magnesium mesh as the skeleton. Surface modification has improved the corrosion resistance of magnesium mesh. Thanks to the introduction of magnesium mesh skeleton and crosslinking modification, the mechanical properties and supporting effects of barrier membrane have been improved. The dense layer of barrier membrane showed dense structure while the loose layer showed porous structure as expected. The barrier membrane showed good antibacterial performance against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria owing to the antibacterial activity of chitosan and the added chlorhexidine acetate. Furthermore, the barrier membrane met the requirements of biocompatibility for implanted biomaterials. Interestingly, the barrier membrane had good anti-inflammatory activity to accelerate the transition from inflammatory to proliferative stage and can promote osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Overall, the sandwich-like barrier membrane has a wide application prospect to guide bone regeneration."

The values of clinical examination, radiographic measurements, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in determining when to intervene on﻿ COL2 AAI are unknown. The goal of this study is to compare these tools and report the utility and significance of each in surgical decision-making. METHODS: A r﻿etrospective case-control series from a single center's skeletal dysplasia database﻿, 2007 to 2023, included COL2 patients that had documented history, examination, and flexion-extension (F-E) cervical spine radiographs and MRI. Radiographic measurements included dens morphology, anterior atlanto-dens interval (AADI), and posterior atlanto-dens interval (PADI). MRI measurements included cervical stenosis, C1 space available for the cord (SAC), and presence of myelomalacia. Criteria cutoffs were defined by receiver operating characteristic analysis and a scoring rubric was generated by internal validation. RESULTS: Of all SD patients, 78 of 547 (14%) had COL2 syndromes, and 53 (68%) met all inclusion criteria. The most common diagnosis was spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (65%). Patients were majority 54% female and 80% white. Ten (19%) underwent surgery at an average age of 4.3 years. There were no differences in AAI clinical histories (P = 0.18). Physical examination revealed higher rates of hyperreflexia in the surgical group (P = 0.0002). On radiographs, surgical patients had more os odontoidea (P = 0.0001) and greater change in AADI and PADI (P = 0.01 and P < 0.0001). On MRI, surgical patients had myelomalacia more frequently﻿ (P < 0.0001), more severe stenosis (P = 0.02), and greater change in SAC (P = 0.01). receiver operating characteristic﻿ analysis defined 7 surgical cutoffs as follows: (1) presence of hyperreflexia, (2) radiographic os odontoid, (3 and 4) F-E radiographs with ≥5 mm change in AADI and/or PADI, (5) myelomalacia on MRI, (6) C1-C2 stenosis ≥80%, and (7) ≥1.5 mm of C1-C2 SAC change on F-E MRI. Applying those cutoffs, it was determined that 100% of patients with 0 to 1 criteria were able to be managed nonoperative. Conversely patients with 4 or more criteria present were indicated for surgery in 80% of cases. CONCLUSION: This is the largest case series on AAI in SD patients with COL2-associated conditions. This study identified 7 criteria that could be used to indicate surgical intervention. Patients who had ≤1 of these factors did not undergo surgery, while those with ≥4 had a high propensity to be recommended for surgical stabilization. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III."

As life expectancy increases, so does the prevalence of DFUs, leading to complex and costly long-term care. This study introduces a novel, flexible dressing composed of natural rubber latex (NRL) infused with collagen (NRL-C), leveraging the natural healing properties of these biomaterials. The efficacy of NRL-C was validated through physicochemical characterization, in vitro and in vivo studies, and a pilot clinical trial. Results demonstrated that the NRL-C dressing promotes angiogenesis in endothelial cells, stimulates fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation, accelerates wound closure, and exhibits biocompatibility in rodent models. Additionally, a pilot clinical study involving six diabetic patients revealed promising therapeutic outcomes, highlighting the potential of NRL-C as a cost-effective, safe, and sustainable strategy for DFU treatment."

However, its potential to promote biomimetic mineralization of type I collagen fibrils and demineralized dentin remains unclear. This study reveals that ALN-pretreated collagen fibrils form ester bonds between the hydroxyl groups of ALN and the carboxyl groups of collagen, accompanied by a reduction in collagen surface potential. Additionally, an adsorption equilibrium of ALN to collagen was achieved at 25 mM ALN. ALN pretreatment facilitates intrafibrillar mineralization of type I collagen fibrils in a dose-dependent manner, as well as mineralization of demineralized dentin in synergy with polyelectrolyte-stabilized Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) nanoparticles. This process effectively restores the mechanical properties of demineralized dentin to levels comparable to natural dentin. Thus, ALN holds potential for localized applications aimed at promoting remineralization of demineralized dentin."

Bexotegrast (PLN-74809) is an oral, once-daily, dual-selective inhibitor of αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins under late-stage evaluation for treatment of IPF. Objectives: Evaluate changes in type 1 collagen in the lungs of participants with IPF following treatment with bexotegrast. Methods: In this Phase 2 (NCT05621252), single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adults with IPF received bexotegrast 160mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Primary endpoint was the change in whole-lung standardized uptake value (SUV) of 68Ga-CBP8 PET. Changes in lung dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) parameters, forced vital capacity (FVC), cough severity, and biomarkers of collagen synthesis and progressive disease were also assessed. Measurements and Main Results: Of 10 participants, 7 received bexotegrast and 3 placebo. At Week 12, mean change from baseline in top quartile of 68Ga-CBP8 whole-lung SUV was -1.2% with bexotegrast vs 6.6% with placebo; greatest mean changes were observed in subpleural lung regions in both groups (bexotegrast, -3.7%; placebo, 10.3%). DCE-MRI demonstrated numerically increased peak enhancement and faster contrast washout rate in bexotegrast-treated participants, suggesting improvements in lung microvasculature and decreased extravascular extracellular volume. Bexotegrast treatment resulted in numerical improvements in FVC, cough severity, and biomarker levels. Conclusions: The reduced uptake of 68Ga-CBP8 in the lungs of participants with IPF indicates an antifibrotic effect of bexotegrast, suggesting the potential for favorable lung remodeling."

      "abstract": "Aim: The liver is the major source of circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. Serum IGF-I levels are decreased in cirrhotic patients depending on severity. IGF-I administration was shown to improve liver function in patients and animal models of liver cirrhosis. However, controversy exists as to whether IGF-I stimulates or reduces fibrosis in the liver. The effects of IGF-I on collagen accumulation by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and its mechanisms were studied. Methods: A moderately activated HSC clone was used to determine the effect of IGF-I administration on the collagen production system, including its degradation. The intracellular signaling system was also studied in the cells stimulated by IGF-I. Results: IGF-I treatment reduced total amounts of collagen deposition in a dose-related manner, while DNA synthesis was stimulated by IGF-I. IGF-I treatment did not affect transforming growth factor-beta levels and type I procollagen mRNA expression. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 was upregulated, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 expression was downregulated by IGF-I treatment. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), suppressed phosphorylation of 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, and abrogated IGF-I-induced increase in MMP-2 and -9 expression and decrease in TIMP-1 expression. Conclusions: IGF-I has the ability to stimulate the collagen degradation system by HSCs through an mTOR-dependent pathway independent of modulation of the activation state of HSCs."

      "abstract": "Diabetic wounds are a common complication in diabetic patients, often characterized by impaired healing and tissue repair processes. The use of advanced biomaterials such as collagen-based hydrogels as carriers for therapeutic agents has gained significant attention in accelerating wound healing. In this regard, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α microspheres, a chemotactic factor that attracts stem cells, can effectively direct regenerative cells to the wound site, enhancing the healing process. This study investigates the potential of collagen-based hydrogels derived from amniotic membrane (AMCh) encapsulated with SDF-1α microspheres in promoting the healing of diabetic wounds in rats. Sixty rats were randomly assigned. In addition to non-diabetic rats (control group), the diabetic rats were randomly divided into non-treated (diabetic) group, AMCh treated group, and AMCh encapsulated with SDF-1α microspheres (AMCh + SM) group. Sampling was done on days 7, 14, and 21 for further evaluations. The results demonstrated significant improvements in wound closure, fibroblast and blood vessel counts, collagen density, and the gene expression of TGF-β and VEGF, as well as tensiometrical parameters in the treatment groups compared to the diabetic group, with more pronounced effects observed in the AMCh + SM group (p < 0.05). The AMCh + SM group showed the most notable effects, including a larger reduction in neutrophil and mast cell counts, as well as lower expression levels of TNF-α and IL-1β genes (p < 0.05). In conclusion, AMCh encapsulated with SDF-1α microspheres had the most pronounced effect in promoting the healing of diabetic wounds."

      "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by fibrosis, immune dysregulation, and vascular abnormalities. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), secreted by immune cells, have been implicated in modulating fibroblast activity and are actively involved in SSc pathogenesis. This study aims to determine whether lymphomonocytic-derived EVs influence fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in SSc. Fibroblasts from healthy donors (HDFs) and SSc patients (SScHDFs) were exposed to EVs derived from Jurkat and U937 cell lines stimulated under pro-inflammatory conditions using tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate + ionomycin (PMA + IONO). Proliferation was assessed using CCK-8 assays, while collagen production was quantified via ELISA. Our findings demonstrate that EVs derived from PMA + IONO-stimulated Jurkat and U937 cells significantly reduced fibroblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, SScHDFs exhibited lower baseline proliferation and a diminished overall response to EV treatment. Collagen production was markedly reduced in both fibroblast types following exposure to PMA + IONO-stimulated EVs, whereas TNFα-stimulated EVs affected only HDFs. These findings suggest that EVs from activated immune cells modulate fibroblast function in SSc, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. Further research is warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting EV-mediated signaling in SSc.",

This study compares two widely used animal models of SSc-the bleomycin-induced fibrosis model and the collagen-V-induced autoimmune model-to evaluate their ability to replicate key disease features. In the bleomycin model, consistent cardiac fibrosis was observed across treatment groups despite variability in fibrosis in the skin and lungs, suggesting organ-specific differences in susceptibility. The collagen-V model demonstrated robust autoantibody production against collagen-V, confirming its utility in studying immune activation, though fibrosis was largely confined to the heart. While the bleomycin model excels at mimicking rapid fibrosis and is suitable for testing antifibrotic therapies, the collagen-V model provides insights into antigen-specific autoimmunity. Both models highlight the dynamic nature of fibrosis, where ECM deposition and degradation occur concurrently, complicating its use as a quantitative disease marker. Cardiac fibrosis emerged as a consistent feature in both models, emphasizing its relevance in SSc pathophysiology. Combining these models or refining their design through hybrid approaches, extended timelines, or sex and age adjustments could enhance their translational utility. These findings advance understanding of SSc mechanisms and inform therapeutic development for this challenging disease.",

METHODS: The study used a post-test-only control group design with randomized allocation. Thirty rats were exposed to UVB radiation (302 nm, 150 mJ/cm&sup2;) for 8 minutes, five times a week over two weeks. Five groups were established: a healthy control (G1), a negative control (G2), a positive control that received a 200 μL subcutaneous injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) (G3), a treatment group 1 that received a 200 μL subcutaneous injection of exosome-derived EH-MSCs (G4), and a treatment group 2 that received a 300 μL subcutaneous injection of EH-MSCs (G5). An ELISA was used to quantify the levels of MDA and MMP-1. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the mean level of MDA in groups G4 (368.33 ± 59.67) and G5 (329.33 ± 82.06) was noted when compared to the negative control group G2 (686.58 &plusmn; 119.01) (p< 0.05). Similarly, MMP-1 showed a significant decrease in mean levels for G4 (0.08 ± 0.04) and G5 (0.07 ± 0.04) compared to G2 (0.33 ± 0.06) (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that EH-MSCs have potent antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties, mitigating UVB-induced skin damage by reducing oxidative stress markers."

Current studies focus on improving hydrogels' biocompatibility and optimizing different stem cell-derived exosomes for better therapeutic effect. Herein, we present a novel biocompatible recombinant human collagen (RHC) hydrogel loading with different MSCs-derived exosomes for promoting wound healing. We modify the RHC with methacrylate anhydride (MA) at optimal concentration, generating collagen hydrogel (RHCMA) with ideal physiochemical properties for exosome delivery (MSC-exos@RHCMA). Exosomes derived from human adipose-derived MSCs (ADSC-exos), bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSC-exos) and umbilical cord MSCs (ucMSC-exos) are harvested from the culture supernatants and are loaded into RHCMA, respectively. These three hydrogel systems exhibit desired sustained release features, and can significantly improve cell proliferation and migration. In addition, these MSC-exos@RHCMAs show excellent therapeutic performance in treating the wounds of rats. Notably, we have demonstrated that the healing effect occurs best under the treatment of ucMSC-exos@RHCMA, following inflammatory resolution, angiogenesis, and collagen formation. These results would supply important value for the clinical application of MSC-exos in wound treatment in the future.",

We previously demonstrated that the large extracellular loop (LEL) of Tm4sf19 is important for its function in osteoclast differentiation, and LEL-Fc, a competitive inhibitor of Tm4sf19, effectively suppresses osteoclast multinucleation and prevent bone loss associated with osteoporosis. This study aimed to investigate the role of Tm4sf19 in RA, an inflammatory and abnormal osteoclast disease, using a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Tm4sf19 expression was observed in macrophages and osteoclasts within the inflamed synovium, and Tm4sf19 expression was increased together with inflammatory genes in the joint bones of CIA-induced mice compared with the sham control group. Inhibition of Tm4sf19 by LEL-Fc demonstrated both preventive and therapeutic effects in a CIA mouse model, reducing the CIA score, swelling, inflammation, cartilage damage, and bone damage. Knockout of Tm4sf19 gene or inhibition of Tm4sf19 activity by LEL-Fc suppressed LPS/IFN-γ-induced TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling in macrophages. LEL-Fc disrupted not only the interaction between Tm4sf19 and TLR4/MD2, but also the interaction between TLR4 and MD2. μCT analysis showed that LEL-Fc treatment significantly reduced joint bone destruction and bone loss caused by hyperactivated osteoclasts in CIA mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that LEL-Fc may be a potential treatment for RA and RA-induced osteoporosis by simultaneously targeting joint inflammation and bone destruction caused by abnormal osteoclast activation.",

However, strategy of targeting ECM remodeling to enhance chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer remains elusive. Here, a 22-gene matrisome signature predicts chemotherapy response and survival in ovarian cancer. The dense, collagen-rich ECM secreted by CAFs harbors more M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) than the looser ECM based on single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of ovarian cancer, suggesting the promising approach of targeting collagen to remodel ECM. An integrated analysis identifies collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) as a major component of the ECM that contributes to chemoresistance and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Halofuginone (HF), a clinically active derivative of febrifugine, is identified as a COL1A1-targeting natural compound by screening the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM). Mechanistically, HF inhibits COL1A1 production via the mTOR-eIF2α-ATF4 axis in CAFs. Notably, HF disrupts collagen deposition and promotes CD8+ T cell infiltration, partially via M2-M1 macrophage polarization to enhance chemosensitivity. Overall, the findings suggest that HF combined with chemotherapy is a promising and effective treatment for ovarian cancer."

      "abstract": "The temporomandibular intradiscal junction is a structural transition region connecting anteroposterior and circumferential aligned collagens fibers in the temporomandibular joint disc. Despite inherent stiffness, this region is incredibly susceptible to perforation under pathological conditions. This study aimed to determine whether the intradiscal junction was the initiation destructive site for discal degeneration. Utilizing high-resolution microscopy and nanoindentation, we characterized the structural and mechanical properties of the intradiscal junction. In rabbit models of anterior disc displacement-mediated temporomandibular osteoarthritis, we observed a significant reduction in collagen fibril diameter and an increase in denatured procollagen within the intradiscal junction as early as one week post-surgery, further spreading across the whole disc. Mass spectrometry proteomics showed that the alteration of the intradiscal junction was the consequence of mechanical stimuli mediated by tenascin-C and metalloproteinase-3. Notably, these degenerative changes were blocked by early reduction of the discal position. In vitro monotonic loading confirmed the dominant contribution of the intradiscal junction to the overall mechanical function of the disc. The present findings underscore the pivotal role of the intradiscal junction in the pathogenesis of discal degeneration, providing early detection indicators and therapeutics. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a prevalent disorder affecting the structure and mechanics of the TMJ disc, with no effective early detection or treatment strategies. This study identifies the temporomandibular intradiscal junction (IJ) as the site where discal pathogenesis begins. Degeneration at the IJ involves reduced collagen fibril diameter and denatured procollagens, compromising the mechanical properties of the entire disc. Rescuing the IJ's position through TMJ anchorage surgery may restore mechanosensitive homeostasis and prevent further discal degeneration. These findings highlight the importance of the IJ in the discal progression, payving the way for early detection methods and treatment strategies that target aberrant remodeling in this critical region to slow or reverse disease.",

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the potential applications of rhCol in POP treatment. METHODS: Vaginal wall tissues were collected from three non-POP and five POP patients to analyze extracellular matrix (ECM) changes via histological staining. Primary fibroblasts isolated from POP vaginal tissues were treated with rhCol III. Cell proliferation, migration, senescence, and ECM synthesis were assessed. A simulated birth injury (SBI) rat model was used to evaluate ECM remodeling following rhCol injection into the vaginal wall. Additionally, the angiogenic potential of rhCol III was examined in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: POP patient tissues and fibroblasts exhibited lower expression levels of type I and III collagen compared to non-POP samples. At a 1 mg/ml concentration, rhCol III promoted fibroblast proliferation and migration, reduced cellular senescence, and enhanced ECM synthesis. In the vaginal wall, the expression of COL1A1 and COL3A1 in the rhCol group was significantly higher than that in the SBI group, with a marked increase in the levels of CD31, CD34, and VEGFA. Furthermore, rhCol III improved the proliferation, migration, and tubule formation capacities of HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: rhCol III may promote ECM remodeling in an injured vaginal wall by restoring fibroblast function and stimulating angiogenesis, offering a novel biomaterial-based strategy for POP treatment."

Recent research has further elucidated its role in various aspects of tumor biology, including tumorigenesis, invasion, migration, drug resistance, and recurrence. Furthermore, collagen is involved in prognostic assessments, the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, immunoregulation, and the identification of potential treatment targets in oncology. This review examines a range of tumor types, including lung, gastric, breast, melanoma, and colorectal cancers, among others. Our objective is to differentiate these tumors based on the specific types of collagen present and to analyze the roles of various collagen types in tumor development, progression, prognosis, and their potential as therapeutic targets."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, lymph node status has an important impact on colon cancer (CC) management and treatment. The role of the tumor microenvironment collagen score and immunoscore in colon cancer lymph node metastasis remains unknown. METHODS: A total of 249 CC patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted D3 lymphadenectomy from June 2016 to May 2019 were included. The patients' clinicopathological data were collected retrospectively. A total of 142 collagen features were extracted by multiphoton imaging and collagen quantification. A collagen score was constructed using a LASSO logistic regression model. Antibodies against CD3 and CD8 were used for immunostaining. The immunoscore was constructed based on the mean densities of CD3 + and CD8 + T cells both in the tumor center and invasion margin on imaging. RESULTS: The lymph node metastasis rate among colon cancer patients was 42.2% (105/249). The multivariate analysis indicated that lymphatic invasion (OR: 3.892, 95% CI: 1.784-8.491, p = 0.001), vascular invasion (OR, 3.234, 95% CI: 1.544-6.776); p = 0.002), mucus adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma (OR: 2.990, 95% CI: 1.413-6.328, p = 0.004), the collagen score (OR: 6.304, 95% CI: 2.145-18.527, p = 0.001) and the immunoscore [intermediate group (OR, 2.473; 95% CI, 1.192-5.130; p = 0.015); low group (OR, 5.877; 95% CI, 2.423-14.257; p < 0.01)] were independent risk factors for colon cancer lymph node metastasis. The newly developed model comprising these five independent predictors showed good discrimination with an AUROC of 0.809 (95% CI: 0.755-0.862). The new model performed significantly better than the traditional clinicopathological model [AUROC: 0.715 (95% CI: 0.649-0.780), p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: The tumor microenvironment collagen score and immunoscore are associated with colon cancer lymph node metastasis.",

The ovary shows signs of fibrosis from an early age, creating a permissive environment for ovarian cancer. A robust culture-platform to study human ovarian fibrosis would enable screens for antifibrotic drugs to prevent or even reverse this process. Based on previous results showing that androgen therapy can induce ovarian fibrosis, we characterized the fibrotic state of ovaries from transmasculine donors of reproductive age. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs, such as Pirfenidone, Metformin, and Mitoquinone, could reduce and revert the excess collagen content of the ovarian cortical tissue during culture. We demonstrated that Metformin exerts an antioxidant role and prevents a glycolytic metabolic shift in non-immune ovarian stromal cells in the human ovary, while promoting early folliculogenesis during culture. These results may contribute to develop strategies to manage pro-tumorigenic fibrotic ovarian stroma in advanced age and metabolic disorders."

In patients with co-existing erectile dysfunction, not responding to medical/conservative treatment, penile prosthesis implantation is indicated and recommended. Severe residual curvature in these cases can be addressed by plaque incision and grafting. The novel collagen fleece TachoSil® (Corza Medical, MA, USA) has emerged as a reliable and robust graft for this purpose, with favorable results. Hatzichristodoulou was the first to publish his new technique of plaque incision and grafting with TachoSil® for residual curvature correction during penile prosthesis implantation in 2018 (PICS Technique). Since then, this technique was adopted and used by various surgeons. In the current narrative review all publications using this novel graft after plaque incision for residual curvature correction will be presented and respective results discussed. Moreover, the surgical technique will be highlighted in detail. The TachoSil® has self-adhesive properties which make it unique and the ideal graft for this indication. Results of the studies on this topic, that are available so far, are excellent. The technique is safe. However, data from more patients and even more long-term follow-up results of patients treated with this technique and graft are requested."

A novel adsorbent material (OSA@CF/Zr) for ultra-fast recovery of Sr2+ was obtained by grafting oxidized sodium alginate on zirconium cross-linked collagen fibers. The OSA@CF/Zr demonstrated rapid adsorption of Sr²⁺, achieving a maximum capacity of 0.415 mmol g-¹ within 6 min. Even after 17 recycling cycles, it retained an adsorption capacity of approximately 0.26 mmol g-¹ , highlighting its superior reusability. The OSA@CF/Zr could be applied at pH of 4-10, were hardly affected by co-existing K+, Na+, and Cs+ ions, and the effects of Mg2+ and Ca2+ were easily masked by CDTA, exhibiting high selectivity for Sr2+. The OSA@CF/Zr was well suited for continuous column adsorption operation, and the amount of treated wastewater and the removal rate was almost independent of the flow rate. The adsorption column, containing 1 g of OSA@CF/Zr, successfully removed over 95 % of Sr2+ from 1.737 L of simulated surface water with an initial Sr2+ concentration of 7.886 mg L-1. OSA@CF/Zr is a very promising material for strontium recovery."

However, it is unknown if middle-aged tendon can benefit from chronic RE with HC supplementation. We investigated the effects of 12-weeks' RE, combined with HC supplementation, on changes in patellar tendon (PT) properties in middle-aged men. In a double-blind design, 20 recreationally active men (age, 47 ± 5 years) were randomly assigned to a placebo (PLA, n = 11) or collagen (COL, n = 9) group. Both cohorts completed progressive lower-limb RE twice weekly for 12 weeks and were supplemented post-RE with COL (30 g HC and 50 mg vitamin C) or PLA (30.5 g maltodextrin and 50 mg vitamin C). The following were assessed before and after the 12-week intervention: barbell back squat 10-repetition maximum (10-RM); vastus lateralis (VL) muscle thickness and PT cross-sectional area (CSA at 25%, 50% and 75% tendon length) using ultrasonography; isometric knee extension maximum voluntary torque (MVT) and peak rate of torque development (pRTD), PT stiffness (k) and Young's modulus (ℰ) using ultrasonography and isokinetic dynamometry. MVT, pRTD, 10-RM and VL thickness all increased post-training (p < 0.05), but there were no group × time interactions (p > 0.05). Mean PT CSA increased more in COL (+6.8 ± 5.4 mm2) than PLA (+1.2 ± 2.1 mm2, group × time p = 0.027). Similarly, k and ℰ increased more in COL (k, +661 ± 331 N/mm and ℰ, +0.21 ± 0.13 GPa) than PLA (k, +247 ± 305 N/mm, group × time, p = 0.009 and ℰ, +0.09 ± 0.13 GPa, group × time, p = 0.018). In conclusion, 12-weeks' RE with 30 g HC supplementation augmented gains in PT CSA, stiffness and Young's modulus in middle-aged men.",

This study investigates the specific effects and associated targets of Norwogonin in RA-related inflammatory osteolysis. Network pharmacology was conducted to analyse the core targets and signalling pathways of Norwogonin in RA. In vitro experiments were carried out to explore the actual effects of Norwogonin on osteoclast behaviours and related signalling mechanisms. In vivo studies further validated the therapeutic effect of Norwogonin in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. The network pharmacological analysis identified 18 shared targets between Norwogonin and RA, indicating a connection with inflammatory response and oxidoreductase activity. For biological validations, the results of in vitro experiments revealed 160 μM of Norwogonin inhibited LPS-driven osteoclast differentiation and function. The qPCR assay and Western blot analysis also disclosed consistently diminished changes to osteoclastic marker genes and proteins due to Norwogonin treatment, including those for osteoclast differentiation (Traf6, Tnfrsf11a and Nfatc1), fusion (Atp6v0d2, Dcstamp and Ocstamp) and function (Mmp9, Ctsk and Acp5). Further mechanism study revealed Norwogonin suppressed LPS-driven ROS production and calcium (Ca2+) oscillations. Also, intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg Norwogonin every other day successfully mitigated clinical arthritis progression and attenuated bone destruction in the CIA model. Our study scrutinises Norwogonin's therapeutic prospects in treating RA and illustrates its inhibitory effects and potential mechanism within LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis and CIA mice, providing a basis for further translational research on Norwogonin in the treatment of RA-related inflammatory osteolysis.",

Sinomenine (Sino) demonstrates anti-arthritic and bone-protective effects but requires high doses. In this study, we developed a Sino derivative, SINX, and evaluated its efficacy in RA. Safety assessments in mice confirmed its suitability for further study. In vitro, SINX inhibited osteoclast differentiation by reducing TRAP-positive cells, disrupting F-actin ring formation, and suppressing bone resorption pits, alongside downregulating osteoclast-specific genes. It also showed strong anti-inflammatory properties by reducing inflammatory cytokine levels. In vivo, using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, SINX improved bone integrity by reducing joint inflammation, maintaining trabecular bone density, and preventing erosion. Histological and micro-CT analyses confirmed its effects, including suppressed osteoclast activity and reduced bone resorption-related gene expression. Mechanistically, SINX ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased ROS levels, and activated the NRF2/HO-1/NQO1 pathway, enhancing antioxidant defenses. Compared to Sino, SINX achieved similar results at lower doses. These findings highlight the potential of SINX as a safe, effective treatment for RA-related bone destruction.",

METHODS: Subjects undergoing CXL were randomized to VNS (study) or vehicle (control) twice daily and initiated treatment with VNS 28 days prior to the procedure with continued use for 28 days following the procedure. After starting treatment, subjects were seen on the day of surgery and postoperatively at days 2, 3, 4, 7 and 28. The primary outcome measure was the change in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ)-25, a dry eye questionnaire, from baseline to day 28. The second primary outcome measure was the mean area change of corneal epithelial healing following the CXL procedure. The secondary outcome measures for this study were the eye dryness score (EDS), degree of fluorescein staining and supplemental artificial tear usage. RESULTS: Twelve subjects were enrolled in the study group and eight in the control group. At day 28, the NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire demonstrated an improvement from baseline in the study group and a reduction in the control group, but the between-group comparison was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). There was a directional trend toward faster mean change of epithelial healing in the study group, but the difference was not statistically significant at any time point. There were four total adverse events, all of which were mild in nature and resolved without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: VNS is an attractive treatment option for patients following CXL. Patients hoping to avoid punctal occlusion or additional use of topical medications following a procedure such as CXL may be well suited for a neurostimulator treatment option like VNS that spares the ocular surface.

These microspheres are successfully labeled with 131I, exhibiting good in vitro stability. Subsequently, 131I-labeled PCMs are administered via the hepatic artery into rats with orthotopic HCC, leading to a significant increase in median overall survival (p < 0.05). Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and immunohistochemical assessments demonstrate precise biodistribution and stable retention of 131I-PCMs in the liver for up to 14 days. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) further reveals the inhibition of tumor growth following 131I-PCM treatment. In summary, the 131I-PCMs display high radiolabeling efficiency, stability, and a promising radioembolization effect in the orthotopic HCC rodent model, highlighting their potential for use in interventional cancer therapy.",

Rasch analyses revealed a high measurement precision of the KORQ within our population. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that patients with progressive KC maintain stable vr-QoL after undergoing CXL. Based on our findings, we suggest considering very early CXL treatment for KC patients that are at high risk of progression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Managing infrainguinal vascular graft infections (VGI) in bypass reconstruction is complex. Although an autologous vein is the preferred graft material, alternative conduits are required when autologous veins are unavailable. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of cryopreserved arterial homografts and biosynthetic glutaraldehydemodifiedovine collagen grafts (Omniflow II) for the treatment of infrainguinal VGI. METHODS: The study was retrospective across two centers and included patients with infrainguinal VGI treated with cryopreserved arterial homografts or Omniflow II grafts between 2009 and 2019. Freedom from reinfection, primary patency rates, amputation-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed using 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: Overall, 63 patients with infrainguinal VGI were treated with either Omniflow II grafts (n = 34) or cryopreserved arterial homografts (n = 29). At 5 years, freedom from reinfection was 97.1% for Omniflow II grafts and 93.1% for cryopreserved arterial homografts (p = .4). Primary patency was 50% for Omniflow II grafts and 55.2% for the cryopreserved arterial homografts (p = .5). Amputation-free survival was 52.9% for Omniflow II grafts and 55.2% for cryopreserved arterial homografts (p = .7). No graft degeneration or graft ruptures were observed during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that biosynthetic grafts are viable and accessible alternatives for traditional graft materials, offering similar efficacy and ease of use. Although autologous vein grafts remain the gold standard for VGI management, biosynthetic grafts may serve as a viable alternatives to cryopreserved arterial homografts in the treatment of infrainguinal VGIs."

      "abstract": "Background: Osteoporosis has become an inevitable health issue with global aging, and the current drug treatments often have adverse side effects, highlighting the need for safer and more effective therapies. Collagen-derived peptides are promising alternatives due to their favorable safety profile and biological activity. This study aimed to investigate the osteogenic and anti-apoptotic properties of collagen peptide UU1 (GASGPMGPR) in addition to its antioxidant activity. Methods: The effects of UU1 were evaluated in MC3T3-E1 cells by assessing osteogenic markers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Cyclin D1, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and Akt/β-catenin signaling. Western blot analysis quantified collagen I, osteocalcin, and phosphorylated Akt levels. Anti-apoptotic effects were measured via p-Akt levels and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Computational molecular docking was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of UU1 via its interaction with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and collagen-binding integrin. Results: UU1 treatment promoted cell differentiation, with elevated ALP, Cyclin D1, Runx2, and Akt/β-catenin signaling. Notably, at 0.025 mg/mL, UU1 upregulated the levels of collagen I, osteocalcin, and phosphorylated Akt by 2.14, 3.37, and 1.95 times, respectively, compared to the control. Additionally, UU1 exhibited anti-apoptotic effects, indicated by increased p-Akt levels and a reduced Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Molecular docking analysis suggested that UU1 could assist the dimerization of EGFR, facilitating downstream signaling transductions and activating collagen-binding integrin. Conclusions: These findings highlight UU1 as a multifunctional peptide with antioxidant, osteogenic, and anti-apoptotic properties, positioning it as a promising candidate for anti-osteoporosis applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for functional foods with added health benefits has driven the development of innovative food products. This study aimed to develop a functional snack made from Granny Smith apples enriched with hydrolyzed collagen using impregnation technologies, including vacuum impregnation (VI), ultrasound (US), and moderate electric field (MEF), and pretreatment with CO2 laser microperforations (MPs) combined with drying methods, including conventional drying (CD) and refractance window drying (RW). The collagen content increased significantly across treatments, with MP-I achieving the highest retention (79.86 g/100 g db). Compared with VI-CD (3.8 mg GAE/g db), MP-RW drying resulted in more total polyphenols (up to 7.2 mg GAE/g db), which was attributed to its shorter drying time (55 min vs. 160 min). The RW treatments also better-preserved color quality, with higher a* (red tones) and b* (yellow tones) values, especially in the MP-RW and US-RW treatments, highlighting their advantages in maintaining visual appeal. Texture analysis revealed that RW drying produced slices with reduced hardness and increased crispness, with MP-RW resulting in the highest sensory crispness score (8.3). In vitro digestion demonstrated that the (VI) treatment resulted in the highest degree of collagen bioaccessibility (~90%), underscoring the effectiveness of this method in improving nutrient delivery compared with the 65% MP, ~70% US, and ~74% methods. The ~90% bioaccessibility is particularly noteworthy, as it indicates that a significant portion of the impregnated collagen remains available for absorption, reinforcing the potential of VI as a strategy for developing functional foods with enhanced nutritional benefits."

      "abstract": "The lack of bone grafts represents a major issue in the orthopedic field, reconstructive surgery, and dentistry. There are several bone conditions that often demand the use of grafts, such as fractures, infections, and bone cancer. The number of bone cancer cases increased in the past few decades and along with it, the need for bone grafting materials. To avoid the use of autografts and allografts there has been an increased interest towards synthetic grafts. This research aims to develop some collagen/hydroxyapatite (Coll/HAp) scaffolds cross-linked with three different agents that could be used in bone tissue engineering (BTE). These scaffolds were obtained with a freeze-drying method after the in situ formation of hydroxyapatite inside the collagen matrix. They were structurally and morphologically characterized and evaluated in terms of antimicrobial activity on E. coli and S. aureus bacterial strains. The results revealed that the scaffolds have porous structures with interconnected pores of suitable dimensions and well-distributed inorganic phases. Coll/HAp samples showed great antibacterial activity even without the use of typically used antibacterial agents. These findings allow us to conclude that these scaffolds are promising candidates for use in BTE and bone cancer treatment after the incorporation of specific antitumoral drugs."

      "abstract": "Cancer is a serious disease in human beings, and its high lethality is mainly due to the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Clinically, the accumulation and high orientation of collagen fibrils were observed in cancerous tissue, which occurred not only at the location of invasion but also at 10-20 cm from the tumor. Studies indicated that the invasion of cancer cells could be guided by the oriented collagen fibrils, even in a dense matrix characterized by difficulty degradation. So, the orientation of collagen fibrils is closely related to invasion by cancer cells. However, the formation of the orientation of collagen fibrils remains insufficiently studied. A microfluidic chip-based collagen fibril tissue model was established to demonstrate its underlying mechanism. In this article, the dynamic mechanism of collagen fibril reconstruction from free orientation to high orientation was investigated at the mesoscopic dynamic level. In the experiment, the mechanical forces from interstitial flow and cell deformation were confirmed as significant factors for collagen fibril remodeling. Additionally, enzymes were confirmed as an another inducer to reconstruct the morphology of collagen fibrils, the mechanism of which was chemical degradation and recombination. Interstitial flow combined with an enzyme is an excellent combination for remodeling the distal collagen fibrils of a tumor, and this phenomenon was caught in a microfluidic platform with a micro-dose. This study to some extent answers the question of the kinetic mechanism of collagen fibril remodeling, and is expected to provide support for further proposed strategies to inhibit the orientation reconstruction of collagen fibrils and cancer treatment and prognosis.",

      "abstract": "COL17A1 is predominantly expressed in skin epithelial cells and primarily localized within hemidesmosomes. It plays an essential role in epidermal-dermal attachment. Consequently, a recombinant human-like COL17A1 protein (rhCOL17) with low molecular weight and high biocompatibility presents a promising and competitive biomaterial. The aim of this study is to gain more insight into the biological functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of rhCOL17, which primarily consists of amino acid residues Gly659-Leu720. Using a combination of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we identified the interacting partner proteins of rhCOL17 in HaCaT cells. These included several collagens, integrins, and cell polarity proteins. Upon rhCOL17 treatment, the expression levels of laminin-332, integrin β1, and the cell polarity proteins PAR-3 and PAR-6B were upregulated, while the PRKCZ, AKT, and TGF-β1 signaling pathways were activated. Furthermore, rhCOL17 was found to promote cell proliferation and mitigate UV radiation-induced damage, partly by modulating these interacting proteins and their associated signaling pathways. Additional analyses using AlphaFold2 and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the rhCOL17 peptide bound stably and tightly to the canonical ligand-binding site between the integrin α3 and β1 subunits. These findings highlight the potential versatility and applications of rhCOL17 in the field of antiaging.",

Because diabetic wounds have multiple factors contributing to their development, the best treatments involve using a combination of approaches. Herein we assessed whether bioactive and degradable bioengineered micro-porous collagen-based three-dimensional scaffold (CTS) encapsulated with adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs)-derived exosomes could accelerate the wound healing process in diabetic rats. Diabetic animals were assigned to the control group, CTS group, Exo group, and CTS+Exo group. Tissue samples were collected on days 7, 14, and 21 for evaluations including stereological, molecular, and tensiometrical assessments. The findings showed that in the treatment groups, there was a notably increase in wound closure rate, total volumes of newly formed epidermis and dermis, numerical densities of fibroblasts and blood vessels, collagen density, and biomechanical parameters than the control group, with the most noticeable changes seen in the CTS+Exo group. Additionally, there was a notably increase in the transcript of miRNA-146a, TGF-β, bFGF, and VEGF genes in the treatment groups than the control group, with the highest expression observed in the CTS+Exo group. In the CTS+Exo group, there was a much greater decrease in TNF-α and IL-1β expression, as well as in the number of neutrophils, compared to the other groups. These results validated that the combination of CTS and ASCs-derived exosomes has a greater effect on improving diabetic wound healing."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed the aforementioned technique on eight patients diagnosed with OSF who underwent management using the BFP with a collagen membrane. RESULTS: We observed a significant mean gain in mouth opening of 5.29 ± 2.11 mm and a significant reduction in pain levels by 2.62 ± 1.05. No complication and recurrence were observed till fourmonth followup. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the BFP with a collagen membrane could be a viable alternative to other surgical procedures. However, our data should extrapolate with larger studies with longer followup."
