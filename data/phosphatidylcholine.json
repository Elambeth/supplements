Methods: In this work, the electrochemical mediator-free and reagent-free analysis of cell lines based on the registration of electrochemical profiles of membrane proteins was developed. We studied the specificity of cell lines Wi-38 and HepG2 and the toxic effects of drugs on cell-on-electrode systems. Results: A linear dependence of the peak current on the concentration of cells applied to the electrode in the range from 1 × 105 to 6 × 105 cells/electrode was registered (R2 0.932 for Wi-38 and R2 0.912 for HepG2). The water-soluble form of phosphatidylcholine (wPC) nanoparticles recommended for atherosclerosis treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases did not show a toxic effect on the human fibroblast cells, Wi-38, or the human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, HepG2, at sufficiently high concentrations (such as 0.1-1 mg/mL). The antitumor drug doxorubicin, at concentrations of 3 and 10 μg/mL, showed a pronounced toxic effect on the tested cell lines, where the percentage of living cells was 50-55%. Conclusions: A comparative analysis of the cytotoxicity of wPC (0.1-1 mg/mL) and doxorubicin (3-10 μg/mL) on the cell lines Wi-38 and HepG2 using the MTT test and electrochemical approach for the registration of cells showed their clear adequacy."

      "abstract": "To date, no comprehensive profiling of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) with pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis has been published. Our study aimed to analyze PC and LPC metabolism with the development and persistence of pulmonary inflammation and the progression to fibrosis; and their relationship. Mice and cell models exposed to bleomycin and/or transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were developed; and porcine surrogates for pulmonary fibrosis were included. Histopathological, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining, transmission electron microscopy, colorimetric, activity and immune complex (IC) assay, lipidomics analysis; and pharmacological intervention assay were used to analyze PC and LPC profile, pulmonary fibrosis and their relationship. Current evidence suggests that 16:0 20:5 PC is a conserved biomarker; and 16:0 18:1 PC, 16:0 18:2 PC; and 16:0 LPC are the potential targets for this disease. Specifically, 16:0 18:1 PC accumulation and exogenous treatment affected lung cell recruitment, migration, transformation, cross-talk, survival/death; and enhanced profibrotic factor release, IC and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, where CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα) and group VI Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (GVI iPLA2) play an important role, particularly in lung and spleen neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes. Overall, these results provide new insights into how the dysregulated PC metabolism, particularly for 16:0 18:1 PC, affects the development and persistence of lung inflammation and the progression to fibrosis, and thus may facilitate the discovery of biomarkers and targets for this disease."

      "abstract": "Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, current thrombolytic therapeutics suffer from limited efficacy and a high risk of severe bleeding. Here, a phosphatidylcholine liposome accelerated platinum nanomachine (PLANE) for thrombus mechanotherapy is designed, constructed by encapsulating platinum nanomotors within isotropic, lubricating phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes. The precisely engineered PLANE exhibits superior lubricity and linear motion. Under laser irradiation and hydrogen peroxide treatment, PLANEs achieve significantly higher velocities than conventional platinum nanomotors, facilitating deep penetration into the thrombi. Further functionalization with thrombus-targeting peptides enables the cPLANEs to selectively accumulate at the thrombotic sites in vivo, demonstrating excellent thrombolytic efficacy. This work presents a novel surface modification strategy for optimizing the motion behavior of platinum nanomotors, offering a promising non-pharmaceutic approach for thrombotic disease treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder with substantial socioeconomic impacts. Despite its high prevalence, the pathogenesis of IDD remains unclear, and effective pharmacological interventions are lacking. This study aimed to investigate metabolic alterations in IDD and explore potential therapeutic targets by analyzing lipotoxicity-related mechanisms in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. METHODS: Metabolomics and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were utilized to profile metabolic changes in NP tissues from advanced-stage IDD. Transcriptomics and metabolomics integration were performed to identify key regulatory pathways. In vitro experiments using human NP cells exposed to palmitic acid were conducted to evaluate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid droplet accumulation, and senescence. Phosphatidylcholine supplementation was tested for its ability to mitigate lipotoxicity, with ER-mitochondria interactions and mitochondrial oxidation capacity assessed as mechanistic endpoints. RESULTS: Our findings revealed an abnormal lipotoxic condition in NP cells from advanced-stage IDD. Furthermore, we identified abnormal accumulation of triglycerides and palmitic acid in NP cells from IDD. The palmitic acid accumulation resulted in endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial damage, lipid droplet accumulation, and senescence of NP cells. By integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses, we discovered that phosphatidylcholine plays a role in regulating palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity. Notably, phosphatidylcholine level was found to be low in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of advanced-stage NP cells. Phosphatidylcholine treatment alleviated palmitic acid-induced lipid droplet accumulation and senescence of NP cells by modulating ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial oxidation capacity. CONCLUSION: Phosphatidylcholine emerges as a potential therapeutic agent to counteract lipotoxic stress by modulating organelle interactions and mitochondrial function. These findings advance our understanding of IDD pathogenesis and provide a novel metabolic target for therapeutic development."

      "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a major global health threat due to its resistance to conventional antibiotics. The commensal microbiota maintains a symbiotic relationship with the host, playing essential roles in metabolism, energy regulation, immune modulation, and pathogen control. Mammals harbor a wide range of commensal bacteria capable of producing unique metabolites with potential therapeutic properties. This study demonstrated that M28 family peptidase (M28), derived from commensal bacteria Peribacillus frigoritolerans (P. f), provided protective effects against MRSA-induced pneumonia. M28 enhanced the phagocytosis and bactericidal activity of macrophages by inducing trained immunity. RNA sequencing and metabolomic analyses identified the CFB-C3a-C3aR-HIF-1α axis-mediated phosphatidylcholine accumulation as the key mechanism for M28-induced trained immunity. Phosphatidylcholine, like M28, also induced trained immunity. To enhance M28-mediated therapeutic potential, it was encapsulated in liposomes (M28-LNPs), which exhibited superior immune-stimulating properties compared to M28 alone. In vivo experiments revealed that M28-LNPs significantly reduced bacterial loads and lung damage following MRSA infection, which also provided enhanced protection against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. We first confirmed a link between complement activation and trained immunity, offering valuable insights into the treatment and prevention of complement-related autoimmune diseases.",

      "abstract": "Gut microbiome influences tumorigenesis and tumor progression through regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and modifying blood metabolites. However, the mechanisms by which gut microbiome and blood metabolites regulate the TME in multiple myeloma (MM) remain unclear. By employing16S rRNA gene sequencing coupled with metagenomics and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we find that Lachnospiraceae are high and phosphatidylcholine (PC) are low in MM patients. We further show that Lachnospiraceae inhibits PC production from MM cells and enhances cytotoxic CD8 T cell function. Mechanistically, PC promotes Sb9 mRNA maturation in MM cells by LIN28A/B via lysophosphatidic acid, thus enhances exosamal Sb9 production. Exosamal Sb9 then reduces GZMB expression by suppressing tumor protein p53 (TP53) UFMylation via the competitive binding of TP53 with the ubiquitin-fold modifier conjugating enzyme 1 in CD8 T cells. We thus show that Lachnospiraceae and PC may be potential therapeutic targets for MM treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third deadliest malignant tumor worldwide. Most patients are initially diagnosed as HCC at advanced stages and are too late for radical treatment by surgery, resulting in poor prognosis. Over 50% of the HCC patients are caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Therefore, effective early identification of HCC in the high-risk population with HBV infection is crucial for early intervention of HCC. METHODS: We employed plasma lipidomics to identify critical lipid classes associated with tumorigenesis in the high-risk population with HBV infection. Potential regulatory mechanisms are validated at multi-omic levels. A machine learning algorithm is used for feature selection and diagnostic modelling, and performance of the models is evaluated by ROC curves. RESULTS: We unveiled varied profiles of plasma lipid metabolites in a cohort of 57 HBV-related HCC subjects, 57 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) subjects and 61 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) subjects with matched age, sex and HBV status. We identified a correlation of the ether phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis with hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with HBV-related liver diseases. The diagnostic models achieved an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.849 for discriminating HCC from CHB and an AUC of 0.829 for discriminating HCC from LC. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate the role of ether PC in hepatocarcinogenesis upon HBV infection and provide novel effective markers for early detection of HCC in a cohort with HBV infection.",

      "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest diseases, despite advancements in elucidating tumor biology and developing novel therapeutics. Importantly, lipids, such as phospholipids, are crucial for the survival and proliferation of tumor cells. However, the impact of chemotherapeutic drugs on phospholipid metabolism in PDAC remains poorly understood. Gemcitabine (a nucleoside analogue) is a first-line drug in PDAC treatment, but its clinical effectiveness is limited by multiple factors. Herein, we employed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) and proteomics approaches to investigate gemcitabine-induced lipid metabolism alterations in mouse pancreatic tumors following gemcitabine treatment (n = 3, control tumors; n = 3, gemcitabine-treated tumors). From MALDI MSI experiments, we observed elevated levels of several phosphatidylcholines (PCs), PC(30:0), PC(32:3), PC(34:2), PC(36:1), and PC(36:2), in gemcitabine-treated tumor tissues compared to the control. In addition, proteomics data revealed the differential abundance of several phospholipid-binding proteins in response to gemcitabine treatments. Furthermore, several endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins exhibited high expression in gemcitabine-treated tumor tissues. Altogether, our MALDI MSI and proteomics data provide important insights into alterations in PC metabolism in pancreatic tumors in response to gemcitabine treatment. Importantly, targeting the altered PC metabolism during gemcitabine therapy might help combat pancreatic cancer.",

Current known enzyme inhibitors include compounds based on a 2-morpholino-5-N-benzylamino benzoic acid, or hydroxamic acid, scaffold. In this work, 81 compounds were made by modifying this core structure to explore the pharmacophore. Specifically, these novel compounds result from changes to the central ring substitution pattern, alkyl heterocycle and methylation of the N-benzyl bridge. The anti-proliferative activity of the synthesised compounds was assessed against cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HCT116. PC-PLCBC enzyme inhibition was also assessed, and the development of a pharmacokinetic profile was initiated using a microsomal stability assay. The findings confirmed the optimal pharmacophore as a 2-morpholino-5-N-benzylamino benzoic acid, or acid derivative, scaffold, and that this family of molecules demonstrate a high degree of stability following treatment with rat microsomes. Additionally, benzylic N-methylated compounds were the most biologically active compounds, encouraging further investigation into this region of the pharmacophore."

It prevents cancer cells from producing DNA and proteins, which ultimately leads to their death. The goal of this work is to modify the GEM medication by nanoforming nanoliposomes based on the composition of Cholesterol, pectin nanoparticles, and phosphatidylcholine (PhC). The drug in nanoliposome form is made using the precipitation method, and several approaches are employed to characterize it. UV-Vis spectroscopy is used to measure the release process of GEM from the lipids and its integration with them. Results of the combination efficiency for PhC.Pectin@GEM, PhC.GEM@Pectin, and PhC@Cholestrol.GEM were recorded at 78.8 %, 83 %, and 80 %, respectively. A UV-Vis spectrophotometer was used to determine the release efficiency of the nanoliposomes, which was measured at pH values of 3, 6.8, and 7.4. The in-vitro investigation employed SRB (Routine analysis IC50) to determine the modified drug's toxicity on breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells, while the in-vitro study assessed the produced nanoliposomes' capacity to do so. The conclusion is that to ascertain whether GEM medicine's nanoliposomes can effectively treat breast cancer in place of GEM medication, clinical trials are necessary to prove the ability for treatment.",

Curcumol is a natural plant-derived sesquiterpene lactone, whose antimicrobial effect against plant pathogens remains unclear. In this study, curcumol exhibited pronounced antifungal activity against a diverse range of plant pathogens, particularly against plant pathogenic oomycetes, which including P. capsici, Phytophthora infestans, Phytophthora parasitica, and Phytophthora sojae. The median effective concentration values of curcumol against P. capsici for spore germination and mycelial growth were 4.75 and 2.11 μg mL-1, respectively. After treatment with curcumol, mycelia of P. capsici exhibited morphological and ultrastructual defects, which included swelling, hyperbranching, dissolution of plasma membrane, and loss of organelles. In addition, curcumol effectively inhibited the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a primary component of cell membrane, by downregulating the expression levels of genes participated in PC synthesis such as Phospholipid N-methyltransferase and Cholinephosphotransferase. This inhibition decreased the accumulation of PC and phospholipids within the cell, thereby increasing the cell membrane permeability and damaging its integrity. In the in vivo antifungal tests, curcumol reduced the disease incidence of P. capsici on tomato leaves as well as pepper seedlings. The systemicity tests further validated the strong phloem and xylem mobility of curcumol in both upward and downward directions. Taken together, these results indicated that curcumol could effectively combat diseases caused by P. capsici and had the potential for development into a novel fungicide for P. capsici management.",

      "abstract": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC) has garnered considerable attention due to its involvement in a wide array of crucial biological functions. However, there is still much to active explore regarding the precise mechanisms that underlie PC's actions in the context of high-fat diet. In this study, we found that both PC intervention and treatment significantly mitigated lipid accumulation, liver damage, and body weight gaining triggered by the high-fat diet. Untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses uncovered substantial effects of PC on bile acid metabolism, especially led to a substantial reduction in elevated levels of free bile acids. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that PC modulated the gut microbiota structures and compositions in high-fat diet mice, particularly exhibiting a positive association with Pseudoflavonifractor abundance, and a negative correlation with Olsenella, Parasutterella, and Allobaculum abundance. Our study suggested that PC held promise as a potential candidate for alleviating lipid metabolism injury, liver disease or obesity.",

This study assessed the effects of starfish-derived glycerophospholipids (PLs) (SPL), characterized by unique ether-linked subclasses, alkylacyl (Alk)- and alkenylacyl (Pls)-PL, on skeletal muscle function, focusing on myotube formation in C2C12 myoblasts. SPL was prepared via chloroform/methanol extraction from Patiria pectinifera, followed by silica gel chromatography fractionation. Myoblasts were induced to differentiate with or without SPL treatment. On day 7 of differentiation, 50 μg/mL of SPL treatment increased myotube diameter. The phosphatidylcholine (PC) fraction (SPC) also enhanced myotube growth at 30 μg/mL. LC-MS/MS analysis indicated the most abundant PC molecular species in SPC were Alk- and Pls-PC with eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid. Treatment with 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC, 1-1(Z)-hexadecenyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC or 1-O-hexadecyl-2-eicosapentaenoyl-PC increased myotube diameter and myokine Il-15 mRNA expression. These results demonstrate a novel functionality of SPC and highlight the role of ether-type PC molecules in muscle function."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The protein Solute carrier family 27 member 4 (SLC27A4) is crucial for fatty acid synthesis and β-oxidation, but its role in hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression is not fully understood. METHODS: Mice with AAV-mediated overexpression of Slc27a4 in liver and hepatocytes-specific deletion of Slc27a4 were fed a standard chow diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), or a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD). Serum and liver tissues were collected and analyzed by biochemical assay, histology, lipidomic analysis, RNA-seq analysis, qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: This study found elevated expression of SLC27A4 in individuals with NAFLD and OAPA-treated MPHs cells, leading to increased lipid accumulation and diet-induced liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Conversely, hepatocyte-specific deletion of Slc27a4 improved the development of both NAFLD and NASH. SLC27A4 overexpression resulted in increased hepatic pregnane X receptor (PXR) expression and accumulation of phosphatidylcholine (PC), which activates PXR signaling and inducing SLC27A4 expression. PXR overexpression hinders the protective impact of Slc27a4 deletion on lipid accumulation and inflammation, whereas its deficiency in mice reduces the effect of Slc27a4 overexpression on NAFLD development. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that SLC27A4 plays a critical role of lipid accumulation and inflammation, and is implicated in the development of NAFLD progression, rendering it potentially actionable target for NAFLD treatment.",

METHODS: In this study, transdermal absorption experiments were conducted to compare the absorption capacity of EGCG and phosphatidylcholine-encapsulated EGCG. Subsequently, the disparity in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant efficacy between EGCG and phosphatidylcholine-encapsulated EGCG were evaluated through cytotoxicity experiments, as well as the determination of cellular inflammatory factors and the measurement of ROS content under different treatment conditions. RESULTS: The concentration of EGCG, encapsulated in phosphatidylcholine, in porcine skin is 40.76 ± 1.29 μg/cm2, which is significantly higher than the concentration of EGCG alone (31.62 ± 2.01 μg/cm2). Also, the ability of phosphatidylcholine-encapsulated EGCG to suppress inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was notably superior to that of EGCG alone. Both phosphatidylcholine-encapsulated EGCG and EGCG showed excellent ROS scavenging ability in terms of antioxidant capacity. CONCLUSION: The percutaneous absorption and anti-inflammatory impact of EGCG encapsulated within phosphatidylcholine were substantially enhanced when compared to EGCG by itself. Additionally, both formulations exhibited enhanced ROS scavenging capacities, albeit the variance between them was not pronounced. These insights furnish a vital theoretical underpinning for the utilization of phosphatidylcholine-encapsulated EGCG in cosmetic applications, specifically for fostering products with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Growing evidence suggests nutritional intervention may influence the development and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Choline, an essential dietary nutrient plays a critical role in neurological development and brain function, however, its effects on AD in humans is unclear. The research aims to investigate mechanistic links between dietary choline intake and cognitive functioning, focusing on the role of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in neuroplasticity and its interaction with amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides in neuron membranes. Additionally, human evidence on the potential benefits of PC interventions on AD, cognition, and proposed mechanisms are evaluated. METHODS: A reproducible systematic literature search was performed using a three-tranche strategy, consisting of a review, mechanism, and intervention search. Using PubMed as the main database, 1254 titles and abstracts were screened, 149 papers were read in full and 65 peer-reviewed papers were accepted, critically appraised, and analysed in a narrative review. RESULTS: Predominantly preclinical evidence demonstrated that PC enhances neuroplasticity, a key biological substrate for cognition, by activating intracellular neuronal signalling pathways or through neuron membrane function. Molecular dynamic simulation methods provided a mechanistic understanding of the interconnection between neuronal PC content and the potential behaviour and trajectory of Aβ peptide aggregation. The results indicate that the neuronal membrane composition of PC is critical to inhibiting Aβ aggregation and neuronal damage, protecting the neuron from Aβ toxicity. This might provide a foundation for optimising cellular PC which may prove beneficial in the treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative disease. Altered PC metabolism in AD was evidenced in observational studies; however, whether this relationship represents a cause or consequence of AD remains to be determined. Human intervention studies did not produce conclusive evidence supporting its effectiveness in enhancing cognitive function. This lack of consistency primarily stems from methodological constraints within the conducted studies. Human observational research provided the most compelling evidence linking a higher dietary PC intake to a reduced risk of dementia and significant improvements in cognitive testing. CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of randomised control trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of lecithin/PC to improve cognition in AD patients, there exists promising evidence supporting its neuroprotective and neurotrophic role. This review establishes an evidence-based framework through chains of mechanistic evidence, that may provide potential strategies for enhanced neuroprotection and reduced neurodegeneration caused by AD. Considering the escalating global burden of AD and the current shortcomings in effective treatments, this review together with the limitations and gaps identified in the existing research presents valuable insights that emphasise the urgency of more comprehensive research into the relationship between PC and AD.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to millions of confirmed cases worldwide, resulting in numerous deaths and hospitalizations. Long-term symptoms after infection or vaccination, known as Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) or Post-acute COVID-19 Vaccination Syndrome (PACVS), present a challenge for the healthcare system. Among the various neurological symptoms, cognitive impairments are frequently observed in PACS/PACVS patients. This study aimed to understand cognitive deficits in PACS/PACVS patients and evaluated potential treatment options, including phosphatidylcholine and computer-assisted cognitive training (CCT). METHODS: The Neuro-COVID Outpatient Clinic at Evangelic Hospital Vienna evaluated n = 29 PACS/PACVS patients from May 2023 to October 2023. Enrolled patients were divided into three therapy schemes: Group A received phosphatidylcholine, B received phosphatidylcholine plus access to a computer-assisted cognitive training program, and C (divided into two subgroups) served as a control group. Cognitive impairments were evaluated in multiple assessments (initial and during therapy) using the COGBAT test. Simultaneously, an assessment of the quality of life was conducted using the WHOQOL-BREF. RESULTS: Primary cognitive impairments, especially attentional deficits were notably evident compared to the general population. While all treatment groups showed cognitive improvement (significant or with a positive trend, but without reaching the level of statistical significance) after therapy, no significant interaction was found between assessment time points and treatment schemes for overall cognitive performance, attention, memory, and executive functions, suggesting consistency across the groups. The WHOQOL-BREF primarily demonstrated deficits in the domains of physical health and psychological well-being. CONCLUSION: This study examined the impact of PACS/PACVS on cognitive performance and evaluated phosphatidylcholine and CCT as potential treatment options. Patients with PACS/PACVS showed notable cognitive deficits, especially in the domain attention. While the effectiveness of phosphatidylcholine and CCT in treating cognitive deficits was inconclusive, the study indicated the possibility of spontaneous remission of cognitive deficits in PACS/PACVS."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is associated with asthma pathobiology. We reported that oxidized phosphatidylcholines (OxPCs) are mediators of oxidative stress and accumulate in the lung in response to allergen challenge. The current study begins to unravel mechanisms for OxPC accumulation in the lung, providing the first insights about how OxPCs underpin allergic airway pathophysiology, and pre-clinical testing of selective neutralization of OxPCs in a murine model of allergic asthma. We hypothesized that intranasal delivery of E06, a natural IgM antibody that neutralizes the biological activity of OxPCs, can ameliorate allergen-induced airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Adult BALB/c mice were intranasally (i.n.) challenged with house dust mite (HDM) (25 μg/mouse, 2 weeks). Some animals also received E06 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (10 µg) i.n. 1 hr before each HDM challenge. HDM challenge reduced mRNA for anti-oxidant genes (SOD1, SOD2, HO-1, and NFE2L2) in the lung by several orders of magnitude (p < 0.05). Concomitantly, total immune cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) increased significantly (p < 0.001). E06 mAb treatment prevented allergen-induced BALF immune cell number by 43% (p < 0.01). This included a significant blockade of eosinophils (by 48%, p < 0.001), neutrophils (by 80%, p < 0.001), macrophages (by 80%, p < 0.05), and CD4 (by 30%, p < 0.05) and CD8 (by 42%, p < 0.01) lymphocytes. E06 effects correlated with a significant reduction in TNF (by 64%, p < 0.001) and IL-1β (by 75%, p < 0.05) and a trend to diminish accumulation of other cytokines (e.g., IL-4, -10, and -33, and IFN-γ). E06 mAb treatment also inhibited HDM exposure-induced increases in total respiratory resistance and small airway resistance by 24% and 26%, respectively. In conclusion, prophylactic treatment with an OxPC-neutralizing antibody significantly limits allergen-induced airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, suggesting that OxPCs are important mediators of oxidative stress-associated allergic lung pathophysiology."

      "abstract": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is an essential lipid for liver health and lipoprotein metabolism, but its circulating levels have rarely been studied in patients with cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes lipid abnormalities and is a major cause of cirrhosis. Effective HCV elimination with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is associated with the normalization of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Since PC is abundant in all lipoprotein particles, this study analyzed the association between serum PC species levels and liver cirrhosis before and after HCV eradication. Therefore, 27 PC species were measured by Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry in the serum of 178 patients with chronic HCV infection at baseline and in 176 of these patients at the end of therapy. The PC species did not correlate with viral load, and the levels of 13 PC species were reduced in patients infected with genotype 3a compared to those affected with genotype 1. Four PC species were slightly elevated 12 weeks after DAA initiation, and genotype-related changes were largely normalized. Patients with HCV and cirrhosis had higher serum levels of PC 30:0 and 32:0 before and at the end of therapy. PC species containing polyunsaturated fatty acids were mostly decreased in cirrhosis. The levels of polyunsaturated, but not saturated, PC species were inversely correlated with the model of the end-stage liver disease score. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed area under the curve values of 0.814 and 0.826 for PC 32:0 and 0.917 and 0.914 for % PC 32:0 (relative to the total PC levels) for the classification of cirrhosis at baseline and at the end of therapy, respectively. In conclusion, the specific upregulation of PC 32:0 in cirrhosis before and after therapy may be of diagnostic value in HCV-related cirrhosis.",

      "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Does abnormal serotonin homeostasis contribute to impaired endometrial decidualization in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Abnormal serotonin homeostasis in patients with RIF, which is accompanied by decreased monoamine oxidase (MAO) expression, affects the decidualization of endometrial stromal cells and leads to embryo implantation failure. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous studies have indicated that the expression of MAO, which metabolizes serotonin, is reduced in the endometrium of patients with RIF, and serotonin can induce disruption of implantation in rats. However, whether abnormal serotonin homeostasis leads to impaired decidualization in patients with RIF and, if so, the mechanism involved, remains unclear. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: Endometrial samples from 25 patients with RIF and 25 fertile patients were used to investigate the expression levels of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), and serotonin. We isolated human endometrial stromal cells to investigate the role of MAOA, MAOB, and serotonin in inducing decidualization in vitro and further explored the underlying mechanism using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analyses. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: The levels of serotonin in the endometrium of patients with RIF were detected by ELISA and immunohistofluorescence, and the key genes involved in abnormal serotonin metabolism were analyzed via combination with single-cell sequencing data. The effects of MAOA or MAOB on the decidualization of stromal cells were investigated using an in vitro human endometrial stromal cell-induced decidualization model and a mouse artificially induced decidualization model. The potential mechanisms by which MAOA and MAOB regulate decidualization were explored by RNA-seq and LC/MS analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We found that women with RIF have abnormal serotonin metabolism in the endometrium and attenuated MAO in endometrial stromal cells. Endometrial decidualization was accompanied by increased MAO in vivo and in vitro. However attenuated MAO caused an increased local serotonin content in the endometrium, impairing stromal cell decidualization. RNA-seq and LC/MS analyses showed that abnormal lipid metabolism, especially phosphatidylcholine metabolism, was involved in the defective decidualization caused by MAO deficiency. Furthermore, decidualization defects were rescued by phosphatidylcholine supplementation. LARGE SCALE DATA: RNA-seq information and raw data can be found at NCBI Bioproject number PRJNA892255. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study revealed that impaired serotonin metabolic homeostasis and abnormally reduced MAO expression were among the reasons for RIF. However, the source and other potential functions of serotonin in the endometrium remain to be further explored. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of serotonin homeostasis in human endometrial decidualization and new biomarkers or targets for the treatment of patients with RIF.

Transdermal delivery of botulinum toxin-A (BTXA) is a promising strategy for PAS treatment, but currently reported approaches are far from satisfactory. In this work, phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (PC/Chol) nanoliposomes were utilized for encapsulation and transdermal delivery of BTXA. The composition, structure, morphology, size, size distribution, etc. of as-prepared BTXA@liposome nanoparticles were investigated in detail. Simulated transdermal delivery assay indicated that the diffusion depth of the BXTA@liposome nanoparticles was nearly 8 times that of pure BTXA and reached 380 μm. 12 facial PSA patients were recruited to evaluate the curative effect of the BTXA@liposome nanoparticles on PSA. Through ECCA (échelle d'évaluation clinique des cicatrices d'acné) scoring and self-evaluation of patients, the resultant data indicated that compared to hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel treatment the BTXA@liposome/HA hydrogel treatment could better relieve PSA to some extent but didn't show significant advantage. Further work is needed to verify the feasibility and curative effect of this method in PSA treatment in the future.",

      "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are revolutionizing the treatment of liver-associated indications. Yet, robust delivery to extrahepatic tissues remains a challenge. Conjugating lipids (e.g., docosanoic acid [DCA]) to siRNA supports extrahepatic delivery, but tissue accumulation remains lower than that achieved in liver by approved siRNA therapeutics. Early evidence suggests that functionalizing DCA with a head group (e.g., phosphatidylcholine [PC]) may enhance delivery to certain tissues. Here, we report the first systematic evaluation of the effect of PC head group chemistry on the extrahepatic distribution of DCA-conjugated siRNAs. We show that functionalizing DCA with a PC head group enhances siRNA accumulation in heart, muscle, lung, pancreas, duodenum, urinary bladder, and fat. Varying the size of the linker between the phosphate and choline moiety of the PC head group altered the extrahepatic accumulation of siRNA, with the optimal linker length being different for different tissues. Increasing PC head group valency also improved extrahepatic accumulation in a tissue-specific manner. This study demonstrates the structural impact of the PC moiety on the biodistribution of lipid-conjugated siRNA and introduces multiple novel PC variants for the chemical optimization of DCA-conjugated siRNA. These chemical variants can be used in the context of other lipids to increase the repertoire of conjugates for the extrahepatic distribution of siRNAs."

While PS shows the highest enrichment and serves important functional roles in the plasma membrane (PM) but its role in the nucleus is poorly explored. Using three orthogonal approaches, we found that PS is also uniquely enriched in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and the nuclear reticulum (NR). Nuclear PS is critical for supporting the translocation of CCTα and Lipin1α, two key enzymes important for phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis, from the nuclear matrix to the INM and NR in response to oleic acid treatment. We identified the PS-interacting regions within the M-domain of CCTα and M-Lip domain of Lipin1α, and show that lipid droplet formation is altered by manipulations of nuclear PS availability. Our studies reveal an unrecognized regulatory role of nuclear PS levels in the regulation of key PC synthesizing enzymes within the nucleus.",

METHODS: One hundred twenty NAFLD patients were randomly assigned to either the observation group (n = 60) or the control group (n = 60). The control group received single-dose PPC treatment, while the observation group received a combination of PPC and liraglutide for 12 weeks. Clinical efficacy, adipose-related factors (omentin-1, vaspin, serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)), liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)), and adverse reaction rates were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. RESULTS: In the observation group, the clinical effectiveness rate (95.00%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (83.33%) (P < .05). Before treatment, there were no significant differences in omentin-1, vaspin, FGF21, ALT, AST, and GGT between the two groups (P > .05). After treatment, both groups showed decreased levels of vaspin, FGF21, ALT, AST, and GGT, along with increased omentin-1 levels. However, levels of vaspin, FGF21, ALT, AST, and GGT were lower in the observation group compared to the control group, while omentin-1 levels were higher (P < .05). Adverse reaction rates did not significantly differ between the two groups (10.00% vs. 6.67%) (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of PPC and liraglutide demonstrates efficacy in treating NAFLD, improving adipose-related factors, and reducing liver enzyme activity with high safety. This approach warrants broader clinical implementation."

      "abstract": "One of the factors that predispose to fractures is liver damage. Interestingly, fractures are sometimes accompanied by abnormal liver function. Polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC) is an important liver repair drug. We wondered if PPC had a role in promoting fracture healing. A rat model of tibial fracture was developed using the modified Einhorn model method. X-rays were used to detect the progression of fracture healing. Progress of ossification and angiogenesis at the fracture site were analyzed by Safranin O/fast green staining and CD31 immunohistochemistry. To investigate whether PPC has a direct angiogenesis effect, HUVECs were used. We performed MTT, wound healing, Transwell migration, and tube formation assays. Finally, RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were used to study the underlying mechanism. The results showed that PPC significantly shortened the apparent recovery time of mobility in rats. PPC treatment significantly promoted the formation of cartilage callus, endochondral ossification, and angiogenesis at the fracture site. In vitro, PPC promoted the proliferative viability of HUVECs, their ability to heal wounds, and their ability to penetrate membranes in the Transwell apparatus and increased the tube formation of cells. The transcription of VEGFA, VEGFR2, PLCγ, RAS, ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 was significantly up regulated by PPC. Further, the protein level results demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of VEGFA, VEGFR2, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 proteins. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PPC promotes angiogenesis by activating the VEGFA/VEGFR2 and downstream signaling pathway, thereby accelerating fracture healing.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a complex, degenerative process associated with various metabolic abnormalities. Ginsenosides (GS) is the main active components of Panax ginseng, which has anti-aging effects and improves metabolism. However, the anti-aging effect and the mechanism of GS in middle-aged mice has not been elucidated. In this study, GS after 3-month treatment significantly improved the grip strength, fatigue resistance, cognitive indices, and cardiac function of 15-month-old mice. Meanwhile, GS treatment reduced the fat content and obviously inhibited histone H2AX phosphorylation at Ser 139 (γ-H2AX), a marker of DNA damage in major organs, especially in the heart and liver. Further, the correlation analysis of serum metabolomics combined with aging phenotype suggested that myo-inositol (MI) upregulated by GS was positively correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), the main indicators of cardiac function. More importantly, liver tissue metabolomic analysis showed that GS increased MI content by promoting the synthesis pathway from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to MI for the inhibition of liver aging. Finally, we proved that MI reduced the percentage of senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, γ-H2AX immunofluorescence staining, p21 expression, and the production of reactive oxygen species in H2O2-induced cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that GS can enhance multiple organ functions, especially cardiac function for promoting the healthspan of aging mice, which is mediated by the conversion of PC to MI in the liver and the increase of MI level in the serum. Our study might provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of ginsenosides for prolonging the healthspan of natural aging mice.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether cryoprotective isoliquiritigenin-zein phosphatidylcholine nanoparticles (ISL@ZLH NPs) could inhibit BC-induced bone destruction and tumor metastasis in both in vitro and animal models. To evaluate the potential of ISL@ZLH NPs, we conducted various experiments. First, we assessed cell viability, colony formation, transwell migration, and wound healing assays to determine the impact of ISL@ZLH NPs on BC cell behavior. Western blotting, TRAP staining and ALP activity were performed to examine the effects of ISL@ZLH NPs on osteoclast formation induced by MDA-MB-231 cell-conditioned medium and RANKL treated RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, we assessed the therapeutic impact of ISL@ZLH NPs on tumor-induced bone destruction using a mouse model of BC bone metastasis. Treatment with ISL@ZLH NPs effectively suppressed BC cell proliferation, colony formation, and motility, reducing their ability to metastasize. ISL@ZLH NPs significantly inhibited osteoclast formation and the expression of factors associated with bone destruction in BC cells. Additionally, ISL@ZLH NPs suppressed JAK-STAT signaling in RAW264.7 cells. In the BCBM mouse model, ISL@ZLH NPs led to a significant reduction in osteolytic bone lesions compared to the control group. Histological analysis and TRAP staining confirmed that ISL@ZLH NPs preserved the integrity of bone structure, preventing invasive metastasis by confining tumor growth to the bone marrow cavity. Furthermore, ISL@ZLH NPs effectively suppressed tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis, a key process in BC-related bone destruction. Our findings demonstrate that ISL@ZLH NPs have the potential to inhibit BC-induced bone destruction and tumor metastasis by targeting JAK-STAT signaling pathways and suppressing tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis. These results underscore the therapeutic promise of ISL@ZLH NPs in managing BC metastasis to the bones.",

      "abstract": "The first line of glaucoma treatment focuses on reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) through the prescription of topical prostaglandin analogues, such as latanoprost (LAT). Topical ophthalmic medicines have low bioavailability due to their rapid elimination from the ocular surface. Nanotechnology offers innovative ways of enhancing the ocular bioavailability of antiglaucoma agents while reducing administration frequency. This study aims to combine LAT-loaded synthetic phosphatidylcholine liposomes with hyaluronic acid (0.2% w/v) and the osmoprotectants betaine (0.40% w/v) and leucine (0.90% w/v) (LAT-HA-LIP) to extend the hypotensive effect of LAT while protecting the ocular surface. LAT-HA-LIP was prepared as a mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol and α-tocopherol acetate. LAT-HA-LIP exhibited high drug-loading capacity (104.52 ± 4.10%), unimodal vesicle sizes (195.14 ± 14.34 nm) and a zeta potential of -13.96 ± 0.78 mV. LAT-HA-LIP was isotonic (284.00 ± 1.41 mOsm L-1), had neutral pH (7.63 ± 0.01) and had suitable surface tension (44.07 ± 2.70 mN m-1) and viscosity (2.69 ± 0.15 mPa s-1) for topical ophthalmic administration. LAT-HA-LIP exhibited optimal in vitro tolerance in human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. No signs of ocular alteration or discomfort were observed when LAT-HA-LIP was instilled in albino male New Zealand rabbits. Hypotensive studies revealed that, after a single eye drop, the effect of LAT-HA-LIP lasted 24 h longer than that of a marketed formulation and that relative ocular bioavailability was almost three times higher (p < 0.001). These findings indicate the potential ocular protection and hypotensive effect LAT-HA-LIP offers in glaucoma treatment.",

To determine the biological significance of phospholipids, the use of chemical inhibitors of phospholipid metabolism offers an effective approach; however, the availability of such compounds is limited. In this study, we performed a chemical-genetic screening using yeast and identified small molecules capable of inhibiting phosphatidylcholine (PC) biogenesis, which we designated PC inhibitors 1, 2, 3, and 4 (PCiB-1, 2, 3, and 4). Biochemical analyses indicated that PCiB-2, 3, and 4 inhibited the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methyltransferase activity of Cho2, whereas PCiB-1 may inhibit PE transport from mitochondria to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, we found that PCiB treatment resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation, which was suppressed by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the mitochondrial division factor Dnm1. These results provide evidence that normal PC biogenesis is important for the regulation of mitochondrial division."

      "abstract": "Oxaliplatin (OXA)-based chemotherapy is one of the first-line treatments for advanced gastric cancer. However, the potential risk for chemotherapy-induced hepatic injury can hinder its effectiveness. Polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC) is often used as a hepatoprotective agent to counter OXA-induced hepatic injury; however, its impact on the antitumour effectiveness of OXA remains uncertain. Our retrospective study examined 98 patients with stage IV gastric cancer to assess the impact of PPC on progression-free survival (PFS) and disease control rate (DCR). Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to elucidate the combined biological effects of OXA and PPC (OXA+PPC) on gastric cancer. RNA sequencing, luciferase reporter assays, live/dead cell assays, immunofluorescence, and western blotting were used to identify the activated signalling pathways and downstream factors post OXA+PPC treatment. The findings indicated that PPC served as an independent prognostic factor, correlating with prolonged PFS and improved DCR in patients with gastric cancer. The combination of OXA and PPC significantly inhibited tumour cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing revealed that OXA+PPC treatment amplified reactive oxygen species and ferroptosis signalling pathways. Mechanistically, OXA+PPC upregulated the expression of haem oxygenase-1 by promoting the nuclear migration of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), thereby enhancing its transcriptional activity. Drug-molecule docking analysis demonstrated that PPC competitively bound to the peptide structural domains of both Nrf2 and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), accounting for the increased translocation of Nrf2. In conclusion, our study reveals the synergistic antitumour potential of PPC and OXA while protecting patients against hepatic injury. This suggests a promising combined treatment approach for patients with advanced gastric cancer."

      "abstract": "Cationic lipids are synthetic compounds of amphiphilic character used in Drug Delivery Systems (DDS), especially in gene therapy, as the carriers of genetic material. As it is known, the main limitation of the application of cationic lipids in DDS is their high cytotoxicity after in vivo administration and low bioactivity. This is probably related to not fully known the relationship between the lipid structure and its activity as well as the mechanism of lipofection or drug delivery. Therefore, in this work we determined the impact of a selected group of cationic lipids - triesters of phosphatidylcholine (Et-PCs) - differing in their hydrophobic structure on model mammalian membranes. In the research, as model systems, Langmuir monolayers and liposomes were applied. It was shown that the incorporation of Et-PCs into model mammalian membranes weakens interactions between lipids, causing the increase of fluidity, disordering degree and permeability of membrane. The destabilization of the membrane in this way can facilitate the entry of drugs, carried inside cationic liposomes, into the pathological cell. Moreover, the studies prove that the structure of the hydrophobic part of cationic lipids also affects the properties of lipid membranes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive type of breast cancer, remains difficult to treat. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a bioactive compound that is insoluble in water and exhibits significant anti-TNBC activity. METHOD: We previously prepared oral aqueous ISL@ZLH NPs; however, they were less stable in a freezing environment. Hence, the present study aimed to improve the stability of ISL@ZLH NPs using cryoprotectants that can withstand long storage times and are effective in TNBC treatment by creating an efficient oral drug delivery system. Freeze-dried ISL@ZLH NP powder was prepared by solvent evaporation, followed by the addition of trehalose and sucrose. The freeze-dried ISL@ZLH NP pow was optimized and characterized. The anti-TNBC efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the ISL@ZLH NP-pow were examined in plasma and organs, compared with those of aqueous ISL@ZLH NPs. RESULT: The ideal particle size of the ISL@ZLH NP pow was 118 nm, which was not filtered out by the glomerulus and allowed the drug to be delivered to the lesions more effectively. Cellular uptake and biodistribution of the ISL@ZLH NP-pow in vivo and in vitro showed prolonged storage in the organs. In addition, cryopreserved ISL@ZLH NP-treated tumors showed significant anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects through the downregulation of the PI3K-Akt-mToR and MMP2/9 signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that oral ingestion of cryopreserved ISL@ZLH NP has the potential for longterm storage and can be employed as a clinical therapeutic approach to treat TNBC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a liver disorder that occurs in pregnant women and can lead to a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The condition is typically marked by pruritus (itching) and elevated levels of liver enzymes and bile acids. The standard treatment for ICP has generally been ursodeoxycholic acid and ademetionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate, but the efficacy of this approach remains less than optimal. Recently, polyene phosphatidylcholine has emerged as a promising new therapeutic agent for ICP due to its potential hepatoprotective effects. AIM: To evaluate the effect of polyene phosphatidylcholine/ursodeoxycholic acid/ ademetionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate on bile acid levels, liver enzyme indices, and pregnancy outcomes in patients with ICP. METHODS: From June 2020 to June 2021, 600 patients with ICP who were diagnosed and treated at our hospital were recruited and assigned at a ratio of 1:1 via random-number table method to receive either ursodeoxycholic acid/ademetionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate (control group, n = 300) or polyene phosphatidylcholine/ursodeoxycholic acid/ademetionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate (combined group, n = 300). Outcome measures included bile acids levels, liver enzyme indices, and pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: Prior to treatment, no significant differences were observed between the two groups (P > 0.05). Post-treatment, patients in both groups had significantly lower pruritus scores, but the triple-drug combination group had lower scores than the dual-drug combination group (P < 0.05). The bile acid levels decreased significantly in both groups, but the decrease was more significant in the triple-drug group (P < 0.05). The triple-drug group also exhibited a greater reduction in the levels of certain liver enzymes and a lower incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to the dual-drug group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Polyene phosphatidylcholine/ursodeoxycholic acid/ademetionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate effectively relieves pruritus and reduces bile acid levels and liver enzyme indices in patients with ICP, providing a positive impact on pregnancy outcome and a high safety profile. Further clinical trials are required prior to clinical application."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of LT-02, a novel modified-release phosphatidylcholine (PC) formulation, for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and inadequate response to mesalamine. METHODS: LT-02 was evaluated in a multicenter double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comprising a 12-week induction trial (PCG-2), followed by a 48-week maintenance trial (PCG-4). In PCG-2, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with 0.8 g LT-02 4 times daily (QID), 1.6 g LT-02 twice daily (BID), or placebo, respectively. All patients continued to take a standard dose of oral mesalamine (≥2.4 g/day). The primary end point in PCG-2 was deep remission. Patients achieving remission at week 12 were randomly assigned 2:1:1 to 1.6 g LT-02 BID, placebo, or 500 mg mesalamine (3 times daily), respectively, in PCG-4; the primary end point was remission at 48 weeks. RESULTS: PCG-2 was terminated early for futility after a prespecified interim analysis; 466 patients (of 762 planned) were randomized. There was no statistically significant difference in deep remission at week 12 (placebo, 13.5%; LT-02 BID, 14.2%; LT-02 QID, 9.7%). In PCG-4, 150 patients (of approximately 400 planned) were randomized. There was no statistically significant difference in remission rates at week 48 (LT-02 BID, 49.3%; mesalamine, 50.0%; placebo, 43.2%). LT-02 was safe. CONCLUSIONS: Despite prior evidence of beneficial effects of PC in phase 2 trials, our induction study with LT-02 in patients with mild to moderate UC was terminated prematurely for futility. Signals of efficacy in maintenance therapy require confirmation in an adequately powered maintenance trial. LT-02 was safe and well-tolerated. CLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT02280629, NCT02142725.",

      "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and are involved in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction. Sec14 is a yeast PITP that has been shown to transfer phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. It is now believed that Sec14 may play a greater role than just shuttling PI and PC throughout the cell. Genetic evidence suggests that retrieval of membrane-bound PI by Sec14 also manages to present PI to the phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase, Pik1, to generate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, PI(4)P. To test this hypothetical model, we designed a photocleavable bolalipid to span the entire membrane, having one phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylinositol headgroup on each leaflet connected by a photocleavable diacid. Sec14 should not be able to present the bola-PI to Pik1 for phosphorylation as the head group will be difficult to lift from the bilayer as it is tethered on the opposite leaflet. After photocleavage the two halves would behave as a normal phospholipid, thus phosphorylation by Pik1 would resume. We report here the synthesis of a photocleavable bola-PC, a precursor to the desired bola-PI. The mono-photocleavable bola-PC lipid was designed to contain two glycerol molecules with choline head groups connected through a phosphodiester bond at the sn3 position. Each glycerol was acylated with palmitic acid at the sn1 position. These two glycerol moieties were then connected through their respective sn2 hydroxyls via a photocleavable dicarboxylic acid containing a nitrophenyl ethyl photolabile protecting group. The bola-PC and its precursors were found to undergo efficient photocleavage when irradiated in solution or in vesicles with 365 nm light for two minutes. Treatment of the bola-PC with a mutant phospholipase D and myo-inositol produced a mono-inositol bola-PC-PI.",

It affects young people, and a considerable percentage of patients need the help of a wheelchair in 15 years of evolution. Currently, there is not a specific technique for the diagnosis of MS. The detection of oligoclonal IgG bands (OIgGBs) is the most sensitive assay for it, but it is not standardizable, only reference laboratories develop it, and uses cerebrospinal fluid. To obtain this sample, a lumbar puncture is necessary, an invasive proceeding with important side effects. It is important to develop and implement standard assays to obtain a rapid diagnosis because the earlier the treatment, the better the evolution of the disease. There are numerous modifying disease therapies, which delay the progression of the disease, but they have important side effects, and a considerable percentage of patients give up the treatment. In addition, around 40% of MS patients do not respond to the therapy and the disease progresses. Numerous researches have been focused on the characterization of predictive biomarkers of response to treatment, in order to help physicians to decide when to change to a second-line treatment, and then the best therapeutic option. Here, we review the new biomarkers for the diagnosis and response to treatment in MS. We draw attention in a new assay, the detection of serum IgM to phosphatidylcholine, that showed a similar sensitivity as OIgGBs and predicts the response to disease modifying treatments."

      "abstract": "Lyotropic liquid crystalline nanoassemblies (LLCNs) are internally self-assembled (ISA)-somes formed by amphiphilic molecules in a mixture comprising a lipid, stabilizer, and/or surfactant and aqueous media/dispersant. LLCNs are unique nanoassemblies with versatile applications in a wide range of biomedical functions. However, they comprise a nanosystem that is yet to be fully explored for targeted systemic treatment of breast cancer. In this study, LLCNs proposed for gemcitabine and thymoquinone (Gem-TQ) co-delivery were prepared from soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC), phytantriol (PHYT), or glycerol monostearate (MYVR) in optimized ratios containing a component of citric and fatty acid ester-based emulsifier (Grinsted citrem) or a triblock copolymer, Pluronic F127 (F127). Hydrodynamic particle sizes determined were below 400 nm (ranged between 96 and 365 nm), and the series of nanoformulations displayed negative surface charge. Nonlamellar phases identified by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles comprise the hexagonal, cubic, and micellar phases. In addition, high entrapment efficiency that accounted for 98.3 ± 0.1% of Gem and 99.5 ± 0.1% of TQ encapsulated was demonstrated by the coloaded nanocarrier system, SPC/citrem/Gem-TQ hexosomes. Low cytotoxicity of SPC-citrem hexosomes was demonstrated in MCF10A cells consistent with hemo- and biocompatibility observed in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos for up to 96 h postfertilization (hpf). SPC/citrem/Gem-TQ hexosomes demonstrated IC50 of 24.7 ± 4.2 μM in MCF7 breast cancer cells following a 24 h treatment period with the moderately synergistic interaction between Gem and TQ retained (CI = 0.84). Taken together, biocompatible SPC/citrem/Gem-TQ hexosomes can be further developed as a multifunctional therapeutic nanodelivery approach, plausible for targeting breast cancer cells by incorporation of targeting ligands.",

      "abstract": "Casein (CAS), a typical protein emulsifier, has functional properties limited by its chemical structure in practical production applications. This study aimed to combine phosphatidylcholine (PC) and casein to form a stable complex (CAS/PC) and improve its functional properties through physical modification (homogeneous and ultrasonic treatment). To date, few studies have explored the effects of physical modification on the stability and biological activity of CAS/PC. Interface behavior analysis showed that compared to homogeneous treatment, PC addition and ultrasonic treatment could decrease the mean particle size (130.20 ± 3.96 nm) and increase the zeta potential (-40.13 ± 1.12 mV), indicating the emulsion is more stable. The chemical structural analysis of CAS showed that PC addition and ultrasonic treatment promoted changes in its sulfhydryl content and surface hydrophobicity, exposing more free sulfhydryl groups and hydrophobic binding sites, thereby enhancing its solubility and improving the stability of the emulsion. Additionally, storage stability analysis revealed that the incorporation of PC with ultrasonic treatment could improve the root mean square deviation value and radius of gyration value of CAS. These modifications resulted in an increase the binding free energy between CAS and PC (-238.786 kJ/mol) at 50 °C, leading to an improvement in the thermal stability of the system. Furthermore, digestive behavior analysis indicated that PC addition and ultrasonic treatment could increase the total FFA release from 667.44 ± 22.33 μmol to 1250.33 ± 21.56 μmol. In conclusion, the study underscores the effectiveness of PC addition and ultrasonic treatment in enhancing the stability and bioactivity of CAS, offering novel ideas for designing stable and healthy emulsifiers.",

The present study aimed to identify the target lipids related to the occurrence, development and treatment of UC by comparing the lipidomics of UC patients, mice and colonic organoids with the corresponding healthy controls. Here, multi-dimensional lipidomics based on LC-QTOF/MS, LC-MS/MS and iMScope systems were constructed and used to decipher the alteration of lipidomic profiles. The results indicated that UC patients and mice were often accompanied by dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, in which triglycerides and phosphatidylcholines were significantly reduced. Notably, phosphatidylcholine 34:1 (PC34:1) was characterized by high abundance and closely correlation with UC disease. Our results also revealed that down-regulation of PC synthase PCYT1α and Pemt caused by UC modeling was the main factor leading to the reduction of PC34:1, and exogenous PC34:1 could greatly enhance the fumarate level via inhibiting the transformation of glutamate to N-acetylglutamate, thus exerting an anti-UC effect. Collectively, our study not only supplies common technologies and strategies for exploring lipid metabolism in mammals, but also provides opportunities for the discovery of therapeutic agents and biomarkers of UC."

The causal link between phospholipid homeostasis and ferroptosis is incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that spin-4, a previously identified regulator of the \"B12-one-carbon cycle-phosphatidylcholine (PC)\" pathway, sustains germline development and fertility by ensuring PC sufficiency in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Mechanistically, SPIN-4 regulates lysosomal activity which is required for B12-associated PC synthesis. PC deficiency-induced sterility can be rescued by reducing the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, reactive oxygen species, and redox-active iron, which indicates that the sterility is mediated by germline ferroptosis. These results highlight the critical role of PC homeostasis in ferroptosis susceptibility and offer a new target for pharmacological approaches.",

They are also key components of artificial lipid nanoparticles, allowing the encapsulation and transport of various biological or chemical cargos. Both artificial and natural vesicles could be captured by cells delivering important information that could modulate cellular functions. However, the potential contribution of phospholipids within vesicles altering cellular physiology has been largely underestimated. Here, we showed that macrophages exposed to liposomes made exclusively with palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) in vivo resulted in a dramatic alteration of the transcriptome profile. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that the exposure to POPC liposomes resulted in a change in the expression of 1598 genes. Moreover, 146 genes were upregulated, and 69 genes were downregulated by incubation with POPC liposomes in contrast to palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylserine (POPS) exposure. Signaling pathway impact analysis revealed that 24 signaling pathways were significantly modulated after exposure to POPC liposomes, including the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Indeed, the expression of several cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10) and chemokines (Cxcl1 and Cxcl2) were increased. These observations were validated by the exposure of macrophages to POPC liposomes in culture conditions. In addition, the proteomic analysis of peritoneal cells exposed to POPC liposomes performed by mass spectrometry revealed that the expression of 107 proteins was downregulated after POPC exposure, whereas the expression of 12 proteins was significantly upregulated by this treatment, including seven proteins involved in the neutrophil degranulation pathway. This observation was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis showing the rapid recruitment of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity after POPC exposure. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the presence of phospholipids within artificial and natural vesicles could be responsible for changes in the function of target cells."

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in most parts of the world. Although there is no first-line drug approved for the treatment of NAFLD, polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC) is used by clinicians to treat NAFLD patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PPC on a mice model of NAFLD, and to study the PPC's mechanism of action. The mice were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet to induce NAFLD and were subsequently treated with PPC. The treatment effects were evaluated by the liver index, histopathological examination, and routine blood chemistry analyses. Lipidomics and metabolomics analyses of 54 samples were carried out using ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a mass spectrometer to select for changes in metabolites associated with CDAA diet-induced NAFLD and the effects of PPC treatment. The intestinal flora of mice were extracted for gene sequencing to find differences before and after the induction of NAFLD and PPC treatment. PPC significantly improved the CDAA diet-induced NAFLD condition in mice. A total of 19 metabolites including 5 polar metabolites and 14 lipids showed marked changes. In addition, significant differences in the abundance of Lactobacillus were associated with NAFLD. We inferred that the protective therapeutic effect of PPC on the liver was related to the supplement of phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin (PC, LPC, and SM, resectively) and acylcarnitine metabolism. This study developed a methodology for exploring the pathogenesis of NAFLD and can be extended to other therapeutic agents for treating NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Amphotericin B (AmB) is a \"life-saving\" medicine for the treatment of invasive fungal infections and visceral leishmaniasis. To date, all marketed AmB formulations require parenteral administration, which causes high rates of acute infusion-related side effects and dose-dependent nephrotoxicity. The development of an oral AmB formulation will entail numerous advantages including increased patient compliance, eliminated infusion-related toxicities and reduced nephrotoxicity. Unfortunately, the gastrointestinal absorption of AmB is negligible due to its extremely low solubility in both aqueous and lipid solvents, and its poor gastrointestinal permeability. Drug-phospholipid complexation is an emerging strategy for oral delivery of poorly soluble drugs. In this study, monoacyl-phosphatidylcholine (MAPC) was complexed with AmB forming an AmB-MAPC complex (APC), to enhance the dissolution rate and aqueous solubility of AmB, in order to enable oral delivery of AmB. X-ray powder diffraction demonstrated that AmB was transformed to its amorphous form following complexation with MAPC, i.e. in the APC. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy suggested molecular interactions between AmB and MAPC. Dynamic light scattering indicated formation of colloidal structures after aqueous dispersion of APC; Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy showed that APC formed small round, \"rod-like\" and \"worm-like\" micellar structures and Small-angle neutron scattering provided three-dimensional micellar structures formed by APC upon aqueous dispersion, which indicated that AmB was inserted into the micellar mono-layer membrane formed by MAPC. Additionally, APC showed an increased dissolution rate and a higher amount of AmB solubilized in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid, compared to AmB/MAPC physical mixtures and crystalline AmB. In conclusion, an APC exhibiting amorphous properties was developed, the APC showed improved dissolution rate and increased apparent aqueous solubility compared to AmB, indicating that the application of APC could be a promising strategy to enable the oral delivery of AmB.",

GA/PPC-modified LNP and siRNA lipoplex targeting NF-κB, a key mediator of inflammation, mitigates acute liver injury, as assessed by liver histology, hematological and pro-inflammatory cytokine analysis. Furthermore, GA/PPC-modified LNPs reveal efficiently intracellular delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and mRNA inhibiting viral infection.

LY-zein-alginate-PC (LYZAP) and LT-zein-alginate-PC (LTZAP) NPs yield desired properties, which exhibit sustained release and are suitable for oral administration. Interestingly, co-treatment of LYZAP + LTZAP showed better release of carotenoids instead of individual treatment at intestinal pH. Bioaccessibility, cellular uptake, and basolateral secretion of LY and LT from NPs were significantly enhanced than micellar carotenoids (dietary mode of absorption). The increased absorption of carotenoids from NPs correlated with triglyceride levels. The intestinal cell uptake of carotenoids by nanoencapsulation may be due to endocytosis, paracellular, and SRB-1 protein-mediated transport. Overall, LYZAP and LTZAP NPs possess superior properties to control the release and cellular uptake of unique or distinct carotenoids. The inclusion of alginate and phosphatidylcholine in zein-based nanoencapsulation could be a promising strategy to improve carotenoid bioavailability.",

Although various treatment strategies have been used, the results were not satisfactory. More and more researches have proved that the application of phosphatidylcholine (PC) may become an alternative therapy for IBD. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview of the possible mechanisms of PC and promote the potential application of PC for IBD therapy further. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed with the following keywords: 'phosphatidylcholine', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'Crohn's disease', 'inflammation', 'ulcerative colitis', 'therapy', 'nanomedicines', 'PKCζ', 'lysophosphatidylcholine', 'microbiota' and 'drug carrier'. The logical operators \"AND\" and \"OR\" were applied to combine different sets of the search results. RESULTS: Studies suggested that PC displays a significant effect in the treatment of IBD by modulating gut barrier function, remodeling gut microbiota structure, regulating polarization of macrophages, and reducing the inflammatory response. PC has also been exploited as a drug carrier for anticancer or anti-inflammation agents in multiple forms, which implies that PC has immense potential for IBD therapy. CONCLUSION: PC has shown promising potential as a new therapeutic agent or a drug carrier, with a novel, stable, prolonged mechanism of action in treating IBD. However, more high-quality basic and clinical studies are needed to confirm this.",

      "abstract": "Dairy consumption is inversely related to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in epidemiological research. One proposed hypothesis is that phospholipid (PL) species associated with dairy consumption mediate this relationship. This scoping review aimed to identify the existing literature in animal and human trials investigating the impact of dairy products, including milk, yogurt, and cheese as well as dairy-derived PL supplementation on PL and its species in the circulation, summarizing the characteristics of these studies and identifying research gaps. A systematic search was conducted across 3 databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) in March 2021. Of 2,427 identified references, 15 studies (7 humans and 8 animal studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final narrative synthesis. The evidence base was heterogeneous, involving a variety of clinical and preclinical studies, metabolically healthy or obese/diabetic participants or animal models, and displayed mixed findings. Circulating postprandial concentrations of total PL were elevated acutely but unchanged after longer intervention with dairy products. The PL concentration remained stable even after a high dosage of milk supplemented with dairy-derived PL, which may be related to increased fecal excretion; however, certain phosphatidylcholine (PC) or lysophosphatidylcholine species were increased in circulation by interventions. These include several PC species with 32 to 38 total carbons in addition to the dairy biomarkers C15:0 and C17:0. The results of this scoping review demonstrate a small body of literature indicating that dairy products can influence blood concentrations of PC and lysophosphatidylcholine species in both rodents and humans without alteration of total PL and PC. There is a lack of well-designed trials in humans and animals that explore the potential differences between individual dairy foods on PL species. In addition, trials to understand the bioactive properties of PC and lysophosphatidylcholine species on cardiometabolic risk are needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Synovial inflammation, characterized by the activation of synovial fibroblasts (SFs), is a crucial factor to drive the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC), the classic hepatoprotective drug, has been reported to ameliorate arthritis in animals. However, the molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using in vitro primary synovial fibroblast (SFs) culture system, we revealed that phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, mediates the anti-inflammatory effect of PPC in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary SFs. PPC decreased the production of TNF-α and IL-6 production while elevating the level of IL-10 and TGF-β. Furthermore, PPC up-regulated the expression of PTEN, but inhibited the expression of p-AKT (ser473) and PI3K-p85α. Moreover, pre-treatment of SF1670 (the inhibitor of PTEN) or 740Y-P (the agonist of AKT/PI3K pathways) partially abrogated the anti-inflammatory effect of PPC. In addition, PPC could inhibit the expression of GLUT4, a key transporter of glucose that fuels the glycolysis, which is accompanied by the expression downregualtion of glycolytic enzymes PFKFB3 and PKM2. Furthermore, PPC could reduce ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-stimulated SFs and MH7A cell line. CONCLUSION: The present study supported that PPC can alleviate synovial inflammation, which involves in the elevation of PTEN and blockage of glycolysis.",

After treatment of 95D cells with DHA-PC or EPA-PC, cell biological behaviors such as growth, adhesion, migration, and invasion were studied. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were carried out to assess underlying molecular mechanisms. Results showed that 95D cells proliferation and adherence in the DHA-PC or EPA-PC group were drastically inhibited than the control group. DHA-PC and EPA-PC suppressed the migration and invasion of 95D cells by disrupting intracellular F-actin, which drives cell movement. The protein expression of PPARγ was induced versus the control group. Furthermore, critical factors related to invasion, including matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), heparanase (Hpa), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were drastically downregulated through the PPARγ/NF-κB signaling pathway. C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and cofilin were significantly suppressed via DHA-PC and EPA-PC through the PPARγ/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/serine-threonine protein kinase (AKT) signaling pathway. DHA-PC and EPA-PC reversed the PPARγ antagonist GW9662-induced reduction of 95D cells in migration and invasion capacity, suggesting that PPARγ was directly involved in the anti-metastasis efficacy of DHA-PC and EPA-PC. In conclusion, DHA-PC and EPA-PC have great potential for cancer therapy, and the antineoplastic effects involve the activation of PPARγ. EPA-PC showed more pronounced antineoplastic effects than DHA-PC, possibly due to the more robust activation of PPARγ by EPA-PC.",

We investigated the effects of PC on AGEs-induced hepatic and renal cell injury. Materials and Methods: In this study, we evaluated cytokine and NF-κB/MAPK signal pathway activity in AGEs induced human liver (HepG2) cells and human kidney (HK2) cells with and without PC treatment. Results: PC reduced RAGE expression and attenuated levels of inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB/MAPK signaling.

Seventy-four NAFLD subjects, aged 55.2 ± 15.9 years, were randomized to consume FO + D (n = 23), FO (n = 27) or corn oil (CO, n = 24) capsules for a 3-month intervention. Serum lipid-related metabolites were measured with ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS)-based metabolomics approach together with multivariate data analysis. The differential metabolites were screened and identified with variable importance in projection (VIP) scores based on orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis models. Serum phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:1/22:6) levels had the highest and second highest VIP scores following FO + D and FO interventions, respectively. Serum PC (16:1/22:6) levels were negatively correlated with circulating alanine transaminase (ALT) (r = -0.268, p = 0.021), triacylglycerol (TAG) (r = -0.236, p = 0.042), interleukin (IL)-1β (r = -0.401, p < 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (r = -0.322, p = 0.005) concentrations, and were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (r = 0.272, p = 0.019) concentrations. The present study was the first to report that serum PC (16:1/22:6) levels were highly correlated with ALT, TAG, HDL-C, IL-1β and TNF-α concentrations, indicating that PC (16:1/22:6) might ameliorate lipid metabolism and inflammation in NAFLD subjects.",

Our results indicated that DHA-PC significantly decreased the murine body weights, liver indexes, serum ALT, AST, and LPS levels, improved the serum lipid levels (TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, NEFA), relieved the hepatic levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and hepatic oxidative stress (MDA, SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT) in mice fed on HFD. DHA-PC significantly decreased protein expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, IKKβ, p-P65, and p-IκBα in the liver and upregulated the protein expression levels of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-4 in the jejunum. Moreover, DHA-PC treatment alleviated intestinal dysbiosis caused by HFD. At the genus level, DHA-PC promoted the relative abundances of unclassified Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Blautia, and unclassified Clostridia UCG-014, while reducing the abundance of Allobaculum, unclassified Atopobiaceae, Alistipes, Faecalibaculum, Lachnoclostridium, and Tuzzerella.

      "abstract": "A growing number of studies reported that obesity is one of the major inducements for osteoporosis by promoting excessive adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Marine-derived DHA-enriched phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) exhibited activities to improve ovariectomized-induced osteoporosis and kidney damage. However, the potential effect of DHA-PC and efficacy differences between DHA-PC and traditional DHA (DHA-triglyceride, DHA-TG) on BMSCs differentiation in obesity-induced osteoporosis were not clear. In the present study, obesity-induced osteoporotic mice were supplemented with DHA-TG and DHA-PC for 120 days. Results showed that supplementing with DHA-PC improved the bone mineral density and biomechanical properties, increased the new bone formation rate by 55.2%, and reduced the amount of bone marrow fat to a greater extent than DHA-TG. Further in vitro results showed that DHA-PC significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation and inhibited the adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Mechanistically, DHA-PC supplement up-regulated Wnt/β-catenin pathway in BMSCs and up-regulated the expression of osteogenic transcription factors, thereby promoting osteogenic differentiation. In summary, DHA-PC exerted a superior effect to DHA-TG in improving obesity-induced osteoporosis. The results provided new evidence for the application of different molecular forms of DHA in treatment of osteoporosis.",

To improve cytotoxicity, we investigated the incorporation of perillyl alcohol or tributyrin as components of the nanoemulsion oil phase. The nanoemulsions presented size <180 nm and negative zeta potential. Both tributyrin and perillyl alcohol increased nanoemulsion cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231. However, perillyl alcohol reduced nanoemulsion stability in the presence of the drugs. Concomitant incorporation of paclitaxel and elacridar in HA- and tributyrin-containing nanoemulsions (PE-NETri) increased cytotoxicity and reduced IC50 by 1.6 to 3-fold in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells compared to the nanoemulsion containing only paclitaxel (P-NE). This nanoemulsion also produced a 3.3-fold reduction in the viability of MDA-MB-231 spheroids. Elacridar incorporated in the nanoemulsion was capable of inhibiting P-glycoprotein in membranes. In vivo intraductal administration of the NE containing HA resulted in a three-fold higher retention of a fluorescent marker compared to a solution or nanoemulsion without HA, demonstrating the importance of HA. The nanoemulsion produced no histological changes in the mammary tissue. These results support the potential applicability of the nanoemulsion for local breast cancer management."

Paired serum samples from 95 MS patients were obtained before (b.t) and after (a.t) treatment with disease modifying therapies. Patients were classified as non-responders or responders to treatment, according to classical criteria. Serum IgM-PC concentration was analyzed using our house ELISA assay. The level of serum IgM-PC b.t was higher in patients treated later with natalizumab than in those treated with Copaxone (p = 0.011) or interferon-β (p = 0.009). Responders to natalizumab showed higher concentration of serum IgM-PC b.t than those who did not respond to it (p = 0.019). The 73.3% of patients with the highest level of serum IgM-PC b.t responded to natalizumab. IgM-PC level decreased a.t in both cases, non-responders and responders to natalizumab. IgM-PC levels a.t did not decrease in non-responders to interferon-β, but in responders to it the IgM-PC level decreased (p = 0.007). Serum IgM-PC could be a biomarker of response to natalizumab or interferon-β treatment. Further studies would be necessary to validate these results.",

Local application by administering enteric phosphatidylcholine could compensate for this deficiency. METHOD: A summary analysis of three clinical studies published until now with 160 included patients with ulcerative colitis was performed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis showed that lecithin enriched with phosphatidylcholine and microencapsulated with Eudragit S-100 significantly improved the remission rate as well as the clinical and endoscopic picture. There was also an improvement in histology and quality of life. All parameters were significantly superior to placebo. The remission achieved was maintained significantly longer with enteric lecithin than with placebo. The side effect profile was identical to the placebo group, which is particularly important for the patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC) has been widely used to treat liver diseases in China. However, there is a lack of post-marketing evidence demonstrating its liver-protective efficiency among patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). This study analyzed the multicenter real-world data to compare the effectiveness of PPC with those of magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (IsoMag) and glutathione (GSH) in patients with liver injury. METHODS: This study comprised the real-world data analysis of a multicenter, retrospective observational cohort. The data were retrieved from the Cooperative Registry of the Hospital Prescription in China between 1 October 2018, and 30 September 2019. A growth curve analysis was performed to compare the effects of different treatments on liver function longitudinally for up to 30 days after treatment commencement. In addition, the dose effect of the PPC treatment was investigated. RESULTS: The final cohort included 6,052 patients with approximately 8% infected with HBV (N = 471). There were 1,649, 1,750, and 2,653 patients in the PPC, GSH, and IsoMag groups, respectively, with an average age of 53.9 years. In patients with HBV infection, the PPC treatment was associated with a significant decline in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (slopes: -3.7, 95% CI, -6.0 to -1.5 U/L/day; -2.4, 95% CI, -4.5 to -0.3 U/L/day, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in the effects among the three groups. In patients without HBV infection, the PPC treatment decreased ALT, AST, γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and albumin levels (-5.2, 95% CI, -5.8 to -4.5 U/L/day; -3.5, 95% CI, -4.2 to -2.7 U/L/day; -4.9, 95% CI, -6.2 to -3.7 U/L/day, -0.07, 95% CI, -0.09 to -0.04 g/L/day, respectively) and showed a stronger effect on lowering ALT levels than GSH (-2.6, 95% CI, -3.3 to -1.8 U/L/day, p < 0.05), as well as a stronger effect on lowering GGT levels than IsoMag (-1.4, 95% CI, -2.4 to -0.4 U/L/day, p < 0.05). PPC had no impact on prothrombin activity levels in patients with or without HBV infection. High-dose PPC exhibited a stronger effect on lowering ALT and AST levels than low-dose PPC. CONCLUSION: This was the first real-world multicenter study to demonstrate that PPC efficiently lowers ALT and AST levels in patients with liver diseases regardless of the status of HBV infection. PPC treatment showed a comparable or better effect compared with GSH and IsoMag treatments. High-dose PPC resulted in a stronger effect than low-dose PPC."

When PDT treatment was applied at an energy fluence of 700 mJ/cm², CL-AlClPc was more cytotoxic to neoplastic cells than to healthy breast cells because CL-AlClPc was better internalized by the tumor cells. An even higher fluorescence signal is expected for neoplastic cells during clinical treatment than for healthy cells, which will be useful for precise and targeted tumor cell detection. CL-AlClPc also facilitated better drug distribution and targeting of essential organelles inside the cells. This selectivity is critical for future in vivo diagnosis and treatment; it prevents side effects because it prioritizes tumor cells and tissues instead of healthy ones. The CL-AlClPc system designed herein had a small size (150 nm), low zeta potential (-6 mV), low polydispersity (0.16), high encapsulation rate efficiency (82.83%), and high shelf stability (12 months).",

In this study, we found that phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes reduced the expression of the CD4 receptor in human primary type-1 macrophages but not in CD4+ T cells. The down-regulation was specific to CD4, as any effect was not observed in CCR5 membrane expression. Moreover, the reduction of membrane CD4 expression required the Ca2+-independent protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn mediated serine phosphorylation in the intracytoplasmic tail of the CD4 receptor. Serine phosphorylation of CD4 was also associated with its internalization and degradation in acidic compartments. Finally, the observed CD4 downregulation induced by PC liposomes in human primary macrophages reduced the entry of both single-cycle replication and replication competent R5 tropic HIV-1. Altogether, these results show that PC liposomes reduce HIV entry in human macrophages and may impact HIV pathogenesis by lowering the viral reservoir.",

In the last decades, several studies have shown that NAFLD increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. In a prospective pilot study, the benefit of treatment with phosphatidylcholine in NAFLD patients has been assessed. METHODS: Thirty patients with NAFLD were enrolled. All received treatment with phosphatidylcholine (Essentiale® Forte N; Sanofi, Paris, France) 300 mg capsules, administered 2 at time orally, 3 times a day with meals for three months. The clinical and laboratory parameters before and after treatment were compared. RESULTS: After the administration of Essentiale® Forte N (Sanofi) the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) decreased by 59.6% (P<0.05) and that of aspartate transaminase (AST) decreased by 75.4% (P<0.05). Moreover, after treatment, an increase in antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase by 48% (P<0.05) and glutathione peroxidase by 48.1% (P<0.05) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that treatment with Essentiale® Forte N (Sanofi) for 3 months was associated with a significant decrease in transaminase levels, in the activity of lipid peroxidation markers and with an increase in the level of antioxidant enzymes.",

Though largely ignored for decades it is currently becoming the focus of research in hepatology. It is important to consider its origin and current opportunities in terms of pharmacotherapy. Essential phospholipids (EPLs) rich in phosphatidylcholine (PCH) is a widely used treatment option for fatty liver disease, and there is a solid amount of consistent clinical evidence for the regression of steatosis after treatment with EPLs. As knowledge of PCH (a key component of EPLs) pharmacodynamics and mode of action driving this widely observed clinical effect is currently insufficient, we aimed to explore the potential molecular and metabolic pathways involved in the positive effects of PCH on steatosis regression."

It remains unknown whether dietary intake with specific lipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM), have distinguishable effects against IBD. Here, a preclinical study using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice model was applied to explore/compare the effects by PC, and SM. Results showed that PC treatment (p.o., 30 mg/kg b.w., 15 d) exerted higher inhibitory activity than the same dosage of SM supplementation on colonic tissue lesions and pro-inflammatory cytokines expressions induced by DSS. Integrative analysis of the metabolome and microbiome indicated that PC and SM supplementation could modulate endogenous tryptophan metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, purine metabolism, bile secretion, as well as vitamin digestion and absorption, closely correlated with their regulation on the abundance of Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, Dubosiella, Turicibacter, and Parasutterella communities in the gut. Based on these data, PC is a more promising candidate for preventing colitis than SM. Our findings provided a scientific foundation for further clinical research to screen more efficient dietary intervention strategy for colitis prevention.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a rise in the morbidity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in line with the global outbreak of obesity. However, effective intervention strategy against NAFLD is still unavailable. The present study sought to investigate the effect and mechanism of polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC), a classic hepatoprotective drug, on NAFLD induced by high fat diet (HFD). We found that PPC intervention reduced the mass of liver, subcutaneous, epididymal, and brown fats in HFD mice. Furthermore, PPC supplementation significantly mitigated liver steatosis and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD mice, which was accompanied by declined levels of hepatic triglyceride, serum triglyceride, low density lipoprotein, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. Using transcriptome analysis, there were 1,789 differentially expressed genes (| fold change | ≥ 2, P < 0.05) including 893 upregulated genes and 896 downregulated genes in the HFD group compared to LC group. A total of 1,114 upregulated genes and 1,337 downregulated genes in HFD + PPC group were identified in comparison to HFD group. With the help of Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, these differentially expressed genes between HFD+PPC and HFD group were discovered related to \"lipid metabolic process (GO: 0006629),\" \"lipid modification (GO: 0030258),\" and \"lipid homeostasis (GO: 0055088)\". Though Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, we found pathways associated with hepatic homeostasis of metabolism and inflammation. Notably, the pathway \"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (mmu04932)\" (P-value = 0.00698) was authenticated in the study, which may inspire the potential mechanism of PPC to ameliorate NAFLD. The study also found that lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and lipid export associated genes were upregulated, while the genes in uptake of lipids and cholesterol synthesis were downregulated in the liver of HFD mice after PPC supplementation. Interestingly, PPC attenuated the metabolic inflammation via inhibiting pro-inflammatory macrophage in the livers of mice fed by HFD. In summary, this study demonstrates that PPC can ameliorate HFD-induced liver steatosis via reprogramming metabolic and inflammatory processes, which inspire clues for further clarifying the intervention mechanism of PPC against NAFLD."

      "abstract": "To become resistant, cancer cells need to activate and maintain molecular defense mechanisms that depend on an energy trade-off between resistance and essential functions. Metabolic reprogramming has been shown to fuel cell growth and contribute to cancer drug resistance. Recently, changes in lipid metabolism have emerged as an important driver of resistance to anticancer agents. In this review, we highlight the role of choline metabolism with a focus on the phosphatidylcholine cycle in the regulation of resistance to therapy. We analyze the contribution of phosphatidylcholine and its metabolites to intracellular processes of cancer cells, both as the major cell membrane constituents and source of energy. We further extended our discussion about the role of phosphatidylcholine-derived lipid mediators in cellular communication between cancer and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, as well as their pivotal role in the immune regulation of therapeutic failure. Changes in phosphatidylcholine metabolism are part of an adaptive program activated in response to stress conditions that contribute to cancer therapy resistance and open therapeutic opportunities for treating drug-resistant cancers.",

      "abstract": "Autoimmune conditions, allergies, and immunogenicity against therapeutic proteins are initiated by the unwanted immune response against self and non-self proteins. The development of tolerance induction approaches can offer an effective treatment modality for these clinical conditions. We recently showed that oral administration of lipidic nanoparticles containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylserine (Lyso-PS) converted an immunogen to a tolerogen and induced immunological tolerance towards several antigens. While the biophysical properties such as lamellar characteristics of this binary lipid system are critical for stability, therapeutic delivery, and mechanism of tolerance induction, such information has not been thoroughly investigated. In the current study, we evaluated the lamellar phase properties of PC/Lyso-PS system using orthogonal biophysical methods such as fluorescence (steady-state, anisotropy, PSvue, and Laurdan), dynamic light scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that Lyso-PS partitioned into the PC bilayers and led to changes in the particles' lamellar phase properties, lipid-packing, and lipid-water dynamics. Additionally, the biophysical characteristics of PC/Lyso-PS system are different from the well-studied PC/double-chain phosphatidylserine (PS) system. Notably, the incorporation of Lyso-PS significantly reduced the hydrodynamic diameter of PC particles. Results from the in vivo uptake study and intestinal loop assay utilizing flow cytometry analysis also indicated that the uptake of Lyso-PS-containing nanoparticles by immune cells in the gut and Peyer's patches is significantly higher than that of double-chain PS due to the differential transport through microfold cells. It was also found that the acyl chain mismatch between PC and Lyso-PS is critical for the miscibility and particle stability. Collectively, the results suggest that these biophysical characteristics likely influence the in vivo behaviors and contribute to the oral tolerance property of PC/Lyso-PS system.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune joint disease that causes cartilage and bone damage or even disability, seriously endangering human health. Chronic synovial inflammation has been shown to play a vital role in disease sustainability. Therefore, downregulation of synovial inflammation is considered to be an effective discipline for RA therapy. Polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC) is a hepatoprotective agent, which was observed to inhibit inflammation in macrophages and prevent collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) of rats in our previous study. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study further reported that PPC can inhibit synovial inflammation. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary synovial fibroblasts (SFs) of mice, PPC significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines production while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines level. In this process, PPC downregulated the expression of TLR-2 and their downstream signaling molecules such as MyD88, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK1/2, and p-P38 in MAPK pathway and p-IκBα and NF-κB-p65 in NF-κB pathway. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of PPC on the above molecules and cytokines was weakened after pre-treatment with TLR-2 agonist Pam3CSK4. In addition, PPC lost its anti-inflammatory effect and its suppressing capability on MAPK and NF-κB pathways in TLR-2-/- primary SFs after exposure to LPS. Collectively, this study demonstrated that PPC can alleviate synovial inflammation through TLR-2-mediated MAPK and NF-κB pathways, which can be proposed to be a potential drug candidate for RA prevention.",

When CTα is deleted specifically in intestinal epithelial cells of adult mice (CTαIKO mice) fed a high-fat diet they present with weight loss, lipid malabsorption, and high postprandial GLP-1 levels. The current study aimed to characterize the changes that occur in the small intestines of CTαIKO mice using transcriptomics and to determine whether intestinal function could be rescued in CTαIKO mice. We found that impaired de novo PC synthesis in the gut is linked to lower abundance of transcripts related to lipid metabolism and higher abundance of transcripts related to ER stress and cell death, together with loss of goblet cells from the small intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, impaired movement of fatty acids from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes was observed in isolated intestinal sacs derived from CTαIKO mice, a model that excludes factors such as bile, gastric emptying, the nervous system, and circulating hormones. Antibiotic treatment prevented acute weight loss and normalized jejunum TG concentrations after refeeding but did not prevent ER stress or loss of goblet cells in CTαIKO mice. Dietary PC supplementation partially prevented loss of goblet cells but was unable to normalize jejunal TG concentrations after refeeding in CTαIKO mice. High postprandial plasma GLP-1 levels were present in CTαIKO mice regardless of antibiotic treatment, dietary PC content, or dietary fat content. Together, these data show that there is a specific requirement from de novo PC synthesis in maintaining small intestinal homeostasis, including dietary lipid uptake, normal hormone secretion, and barrier function.",

Results showed PC(16:0_18:1) (1365.24 μg/mL) and PC(16:0_20:2) (1354.73 μg/mL) had the most abundant intensity in goat milk. Twelve novel bioactive lipases: LDHB, NSDHL, ALDH3B1, DPYD, ALDH1A1, ALDOC, ENO1, ALDOA, PRDX6, XDH, ENO3 and GAPDH were nuclear-localized in PC biosynthesis. PC in C15:0, C16:0 increased while C6:0, C8:0 decreased and the characterized protein XDH was about 91 times up regulated under 0.085 MPa, 65 °C flash vacuum and 5 mT magnetic field.

DHA-PC has become the interest recently as its better bioavailability and anti-oxidation capacity. In this study, the anti-angiogenic effect of DHA-PC was evaluated. The capacities of proliferation, migration, tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were significantly declined after DHA-PC treatment. Furthermore, DHA-PC inhibited the neovascularization of the chick chorioallantoic membrane in vivo. Mechanism results indicated that DHA-PC enhances the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) at transcriptional and translational level, subsequently down-regulates the VEGFR2 expression and VEGFR2-mediated downstream Ras/ERK pathway, resulting in significant reduction in proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, PPARγ-specific antagonist GW9662 partly reversed the inhibition effects of DHA-PC on tube formation and neovascularization, suggesting that DHA-PC exerts anti-angiogenesis effect through activating PPARγ. These findings indicated that DHA-PC has a great prospect of anti-tumor angiogenesis therapy."

      "abstract": "Causing more and more deaths, stroke has been a leading cause of death worldwide. However, success in clinical stroke trials has remained elusive. N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA) was an endogenous highly hydrophobic molecule with outstanding neuroprotective effect. In this article, hydrogen bonds were successfully formed between OEA and soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC). The synthetic OEA-SPC complex and DSPE-PEG were self-assembled into liposomes (OEA NPs), with OEA-SPC loaded in the core and PEG formed a hydrophilic shell. Hence, highly hydrophobic OEA was loaded into liposomes as amorphous state with a drug loading of 8.21 ± 0.18 wt%. With fairly uniform size and well-distributed character, the OEA NPs were systemically assessed as an intravenous formulation for stroke therapy. The results indicated that the administration of OEA NPs could significantly improve the survival rate and the Garcia score of the MCAO rats compared with free OEA. The TTC-stained brain slices declared that the cerebral infarct volume and the edema degree induced by MCAO could be decreased to an extremely low level via the administration of OEA NPs. The Morris water maze (MWM) test suggested that the spatial learning and memory of the MCAO rats could also be ameliorated by OEA NPs. The immunofluorescence assay stated that the apoptosis of the neurons and the inflammation within the brain were greatly inhibited. The results suggest that the OEA NPs have a great chance to develop OEA as a potential anti-stroke formulation for clinic application.",

Phosphatidylcholine from soya (soy-PC) was used as the comparison of PC form. Both the lipid accumulation and activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were measured to determine lipogenesis, whereas the glycerol content was measured to evaluate lipolysis. The CLA uptake also measured to find out the utilization of CLA by the cells. As a results, lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with CLA-PC (50-400 μM). Both CLA-PC and soy-PC significantly suppressed lipid accumulation compared with CLA-FFA, even though the amount of CLA in CLA-PC was a half than CLA-FFA. The CLA uptake of PC form was superior to FFA form, however, no difference was noted between CLA-PC and soy-PC. These forms exerted their antiadipogenic activity via the suppression of lipogenesis, and not by increasing lipolysis. Short-term treatment, especially in the middle stage of differentiation, was more effective than long-term treatment; especially for CLA-FFA. The antiadipogenic effect of CLA-PC was partially attributed to the chemical structure of the PC molecule. These results provide important information for the utilization of physiologically functional fatty acids and particularly CLA in the food and medical fields.",

First, dARTPC featured with unique amphipathic properties formed liposomes by classical thin-film methods. After that, Ir was encapsulated into dARTPC-based liposomes (Ir/dARTPC-LP) by the triethylammonium sucrose octasulfate gradient method. Physicochemical characterization indicated that Ir/dARTPC-LP had a mean size of around 140 nm and a negative ζ potential of approximately -30 mV. Most noticeably, liposomes displayed an encapsulation efficiency of greater than 98% with a controllable drug loading of 4-22%. The in vitro release of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and Ir from Ir/dARTPC-LP was investigated by dialysis in different media. It was found that effective release of both DHA (65.42%) and Ir (77.28%) in a weakly acidic medium (pH 5.0) after 48 h was achieved in comparison to very slow release under a neutral environment (DHA 9.90% and Ir 8.72%), indicating the controllable release of both drugs. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the improved cellular internalization of Ir/dARTPC-LP. The cytotoxicity of Ir/dARTPC-LP was evaluated in the MCF-7, A549, and HepG2 cell lines. The results showed that Ir/dARTPC-LP had significant synergistic efficacy in the loss of cell growth. In vivo anticancer evaluation was performed using a 4T1 xenograft tumor model. Ir/dARTPC-LP had a high tumor inhibition rate of 62.7% without significant toxicity in comparison with the injection of Ir solution. Taken together, dARTPC encapsulated with Ir has great potential for anticancer combination therapy.",

Moreover, the caspase-3 activity was lower after 48-h treatment with LipoAgNPs than with AgNPs.

      "abstract": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive cholangitis resulting in cirrhosis and cholangiocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis is unclear and an effective medical therapy is not available. It is highly associated to ulcerative colitis for which recently a disturbance of the tight junction (TJ) barrier has been claimed as etiologic feature. Genetic mouse models with intestinal TJ disruption showed a defective transport of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to intestinal mucus. Consequently, an ulcerative colitis phenotype developed. In the present study we evaluate whether there is also a paracellular transport of PC through TJ to the apical side of cholangiocytes. As in ulcerative colitis, a TJ defect could lead to deficient PC in biliary mucus. It would impair the protective barrier against aggressive bile acids in bile. Indeed with polarized biliary tumor cells a vectorial transport of PC from basal to luminal side was demonstrated using a transwell culture system. PC was not taken up by the cells but moved paracellularly via TJ to the apical side driven by luminal HCO3- generated by the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) and the anion exchange protein 2 (AE2). If such a TJ-mediated PC translocation to the apical surface of cholangiocytes could be disrupted in a genetic mouse model, a PSC phenotype would be expected. With such an experimental model functional operative therapies can be evaluated. We propose that disruption of TJ mediated paracellular transport of PC to the apical side of cholangiocytes could lead to biliary mucus PC depletion. This may be a pathogenetic factor for development of PSC."

Site-directed mutagenesis of SR-B1 revealed that S112F and T175A mutations in its ectodomain abrogated binding and endocytosis of PC liposomes in HEK293T cells. K151A and K156A mutations attenuated their binding and endocytosis too. Although the effects of mutations on binding and endocytosis were similar between PC liposomes and PC/PA and PA liposomes, SR-B1 dependency appeared to be PC > PC/PA > PA liposomes. Our data indicate that (i) nanoparticles including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), silica, and liposomes bind to a common or close site of SR-B1, and (ii) PC/PA and PA liposomes bind not only to SR-B1 but also other receptor(s) in HEK293T cells. In addition, PC/PA liposomes induced lipid droplet (LD) formation in HEK293T cells more than PC liposomes. Treatment of HEK293T cells with SR-B1 siRNA suppressed PC/PA liposome-induced LD formation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SR-B1 plays an essential role in binding PC-containing liposomes and the subsequent induction of cellular responses, while PA can modulate them.",

Eggs, dairy, and meat are rich in phosphatidylcholine (PC), whereas cereal and legumes are rich in free choline. Excess dietary choline leads to increase plasma trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Epidemiological studies suggest that plasma TMAO is a biomarker for atherosclerosis and it has been suggested that a lower intake of eggs and meat would reduce choline consumption and thus reduce atherosclerosis development. To investigate whether the form of dietary choline influences atherosclerosis development in Ldlr-/-, we randomly fed Ldlr-/-male mice (aged 8 - 10 wk) one of the three 40% (calories) high fat diets (with 0.5% w/w of cholesterol): Control (0.1% w/w free-choline, CON), choline-supplemented (0.4% free-choline, CS), or PC-supplemented (0.1% free-choline and 0.3% choline from PC, PCS). After 12-wk of dietary intervention, the animals were euthanized and tissues and blood collected. Aortic atherosclerotic plaque area, plasma choline, lipid metabolites, and spleen and peripheral blood cell phenotypes were quantified. Surprisingly, the PCS group had significantly lower atherosclerotic lesions while having 2-fold higher plasma TMAO levels compared with both CON and CS groups (P<0.05). In the fasting state, we found that PCS decreased plasma very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) and apolipoprotein B48 (APOB48), and increased plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). However, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion was not affected by dietary treatment. We observed lower levels of circulating pro-atherogenic chemokines in the PCS group. Our study suggests that increased dietary PC intake does not induce a pro-atherogenic phenotype.",

However, its chemical instability in an aqueous solution has limited its clinical application. Encapsulating ICG in liposomes, phosphatidylcholine nanoparticles (PC-NP), has shown partial effectiveness in stabilizing it. Prompted by our recent finding that the zein-phosphatidylcholine hybrid nanoparticles (Z/PC-NP) provide an advanced drug carrier compared to PC-NP, we herein investigated the potential of Z/PC-NP as an improved ICG formulation. Dynamic light scattering analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy studies showed that ICG was encapsulated in Z/PC-NP without hampering the high colloidal stability of the Z/PC-NP. During storage, the Z/PC-NP almost completely inhibited the ICG aggregation, whereas the PC-NP did so partially. The Z/PC-NP also more effectively blocked the ICG degradation compared to the PC-NP. The phototoxicity of ICG encapsulated in Z/PC-NP on cancer cells was twofold higher than that in the PC-NP. The ICG encapsulated in Z/PC-NP, but not in PC-NP, maintained its photocytotoxicity after four-day storage. These findings highlight the promising potential of Z/PC-NP as an ICG formulation that provides a higher stabilization effect than PC-NP."

The cryoprotectant potential of phospholipids of vegetal origin as soybean lecithin has been investigated as a substitute for egg yolk in diluents used for the cryopreservation of human spermatozoa. Therefore, the objective of this study was comparing the efficacy of a synthetic cryoprotectant supplemented with L-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and L-acetyl-carnitine (ANTIOX-PC) and the standard egg-based TEST-yolk buffer (TYB) in preserving sperm motility and chromatin quality in cryopreserved semen samples. METHODS: Prospective experimental study in which semen samples from 63 men with normal sperm motility and 58 men with low sperm motility were included and analyzed both before and after cryopreservation using ANTIOX-PC or TYB freezing media. Sperm quality was evaluated by routine semen analysis and DNA fragmentation index using the Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. RESULTS: Differences in the post-thaw progressive motility and DNA fragmentation index were not detected between TYB and ANTIOX-PC cryoprotectants in both normal and low sperm motility groups (P>0.05). However, ANTIOX-PC medium retained higher non-progressive motility and lower percentage of immotile sperm when compared to TYB medium, resulting in a greater total motile sperm count (P<0.05), regardless baseline values of motility characteristic of the normospermic or asthenozoospermic samples. CONCLUSIONS: ANTIOX-PC medium was effective to protect human sperm during a freeze-thaw cycle compared to the TYB medium. A clinically relevant advantage in better preserving kinetic parameters as higher total motility and lower immotile post-thawed sperm from ANTIOX-PC, in normal and low motility semen samples, demonstrated the positive impact of phospholipid and antioxidant treatment on sperm cryotolerance with high potential for egg yolk lipids replacement and biosafety."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The culture supernatants of splenocytes, which was exposed to EPA-PC along with LPS, was harvested to determine the production of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4 , IL-5, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-2 and IL-12/IL-23(p40)]. Cytokines were measured using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The co-administration of EPA-PC with LPS resulted in a significantly lower IFN-γ expression than that observed with LPS alone (p < 0.01). Moreover, treatment with EPA-PC and LPS significantly decreased IL-2, IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23(p40) expression (p < 0.01). Coadministration of EPA-PC at a concentration of 0.3 μg/mL with LPS resulted in a higher IL-5 expression after 24 hr of treatment when compared to LPS alone (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that EPA-PC is more effective in decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23(p40)] upon induction of inflammation.",

It has been reported that dietary EPA-enriched phosphatidylcholine (EPA-PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (EPA-PE) could improve brain function. However, it was unclear that whether EPA-PC and EPA-PE intervention could change the lipid composition of cerebral cortex in AD mice. All the senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. After another 8 weeks of intervention with EPA-PC and EPA-PE (1%, w/w), the cerebral cortex lipid levels were determined by lipidomics. Results demonstrated that dietary supplementation with EPA-PE and EPA PC for 8 weeks significantly increased the amount of choline plasmalogen (pPC) and Lyso phosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) in the cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice fed with high fat diet. Meanwhile, administration with EPA-PE and EPA-PC could significantly decrease the level of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA)-containing phosphatidylserine (PS) as well as increase the levels of arachidonic acid (AA)-containing phosphatidylethanolamine and PS in cerebral cortex. EPA-PE and EPA-PC could restore the lipid homeostasis of dementia mice to a certain degree, which might provide a potential novel therapy strategy and direction of dietary intervention in patients with cognitive impairment.",

Topical supplementation with delayed intestinal release PC formulations is assumed to compensate this lack. Three monocenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a 30% PC-containing lecithin were successful, whereas 1 trial with >94% PC-containing lecithin failed. OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of 30% PC-containing lecithin provided in a delayed intestinal release formulation for treatment efficacy of ulcerative colitis was evaluated by meta-analysis of 3 RCTs. METHODS: Meta-analysis of 3 studies was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% Cl were calculated for remission, clinical and endoscopic improvement, histology, and life quality. p values <0.05 were accepted as significant. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of 3 RTCs with 160 included patients with ulcerative colitis verified that PC improved the rate of remission (OR = 9.68), as well as clinical (OR = 30.58) and endoscopic outcomes (OR = 36.73). Within the available patient population, also histology and quality of life became better. All effects were significant over placebo. Achieved remission was maintained in a higher percentage of patients under intestinal-release PC formulation than placebo. The profile of adverse events was identical to the placebo population. CONCLUSIONS: A 30% PC-containing lecithin in delayed intestinal release formulation improves clinical and endoscopic outcomes, histologic activity, and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. For the patients, lack of adverse events is an important consideration.",

As observed, DHA-PC and EPA-PC obviously inhibited the transplanted tumor growth and the positive expression of Ki67. The metastatic nodules and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the lung indicated that DHA-PC and EPA-PC suppressed lung metastasis. PPARγ has a key role in cell survival, which may be a target for cancer therapy. Further mechanism research indicated that DHA-PC and EPA-PC significantly enhanced the levels of PPARγ and subsequently downregulated the NF-κB pathway. DHA-PC and EPA-PC accelerate cancer cell apoptosis by decreasing NF-κB-mediated antiapoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. In addition, DHA-PC and EPA-PC significantly decreased the levels of NF-κB-mediated matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and heparanase (HPA), which block the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, thereby suppressing lung metastasis.

In this study, nano-sized carriers were formulated for improving the non- invasive oto-topical delivery of caroverine for the treatment of tinnitus. METHODS: Caroverine was loaded into two types of phospholipid-containing systems, namely, nano elastic vesicles (EVs) and phosphatidylcholine-based liquid crystalline nano-particles (PC-LCNPs). The prepared formulations were characterized for their drug loading, particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, morphological features by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and physicochemical stability. In addition, comparative ex vivo transport study was carried out using rabbits' TM for both types of formulations. RESULTS: The findings show a significant superiority of PC-LCNPs over the EVs formulations in the drug payload (1% and 0.25%, respectively), physical stability and the efficiency of permeation across rabbits' TM. The results showed a more than twofold increase in the cumulative drug flux values of PC-LCNPs (699.58 ± 100 µg/cm2) compared to the EVs (250 ± 45 µg/cm2) across the TM. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed the smart physicochemical properties of PC-LCNPs demonstrating the potential of this carrier as a new attractive candidate for improving the non-invasive oto-topical delivery of caroverine.",

Herein, we formulated a multifunctional polyelectrolyte wound dressing membrane on the basis of chitosan (Ch) and hyaluronan (HA) enhanced by phosphatidylcholine dihydroquercetin (PCDQ). Physicochemical properties and microstructures of fabricated films were investigated adopting Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Furthermore, water uptakes, wettability profiles, surface roughness, and mechanical characteristics of the developed membranes were studied. The developed wound dressing revealed free radical scavenging potency, hemocompatibility with a tendency to enhance blood clotting. Furthermore, incorporation of PCDQ significantly promoted the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of Ch/HA/PCDQ. Moreover, Ch/HA/PCDQ films exhibited cellular compatibility towards mouse fibroblast cells. The capability of Ch/HA/PCDQ to promote wound healing was evaluated using adult Wistar albino female rats. The in vivo findings demonstrated that Ch/HA/PCDQ films significantly ameliorated mouse full-thickness wounds as evidenced by a reduction in the wound area. Moreover, histological examinations of wounds dressed with Ch/HA/PCDQ illustrated a prominent re-epithelialization compared with wounds handled with the cotton gauze and Ch/HA dressings, exposing the efficiency of PCDQ. These findings emphasized that a Ch/HA/PCDQ membrane has outstanding potential for wound healing and skin regeneration.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: This study aimed to identify the plasma metabolite fingerprint in patients with heart failure and to develop a prediction tool based on differential metabolites for predicting the response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively recruited 32 healthy individuals and 42 consecutive patients with HF who underwent CRT between January 2018 and January 2019. Peripheral venous blood samples, clinical data, and echocardiographic signatures were collected before CRT implantation. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to perform untargeted metabolites profiling for peripheral plasma under ESI+ and ESI- modes. After 6 month follow-up, patients were categorized as CRT responders or non-responders based on the alterations of echocardiographic characteristics. Compared with healthy individuals, patients with HF had distinct metabolomic profiles under both ESI+ and ESI- modes, featuring increased free fatty acids, carnitine, β-hydroxybutyrate, and dysregulated lipids with heterogeneous alterations such as phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and sphingomyelins. Disparities of baseline metabolomics profile were observed between CRT responders and non-responders under ESI+ mode but not under ESI- mode. Further metabolites analysis revealed that a group of 20 PCs metabolites under ESI+ mode were major contributors to the distinct profiles between the two groups. We utilized LASSO regression model and identified a panel of four PCs metabolites [including PC (20:0/18:4), PC (20:4/20:0), PC 40:4, and PC (20:4/18:0)] as major predictors for CRT response prediction. Among our whole population (n = 42), receive operating characteristics analysis revealed that the four PCs-based model could nicely discriminate the CRT responders from non-responders (area under the curve = 0.906) with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 90.0%. Cross-validation analysis also showed a satisfactory and robust performance of the model with the area under the curve of 0.910 in the training dataset and 0.880 in the testing dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HF held significantly altered plasma metabolomics profile compared with the healthy individuals. Within the HF group, the non-responders had a distinct plasma metabolomics profile in contrast to the responders to CRT, which was characterized by increased PCs species. A novel predictive model incorporating four PCs metabolites performed well in identifying CRT non-responders. These four PCs might severe as potential biomarkers for predicting CRT response. Further validations are needed in multi-centre studies with larger external cohorts.",

      "abstract": "Membrane phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), consist of distinct fatty acids occupying the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, reflecting the highly regulated nature of lipid biosynthesis. However, little is known about the influence of dietary lipids on the positional nature of fatty acids in tissues, including the enrichment of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in chicken egg yolk phospholipids. This study was undertaken to characterize the PC and PE species in egg lipids derived from Lohmann hens (n=10/treatment) randomly allocated to either a control (no supplementation), a flaxseed oil (FO) or a marine algal oil (MA) diet. Each of the FO or MA diets supplied three levels of total omega-3 PUFA (0.20, 0.40 and 0.60% of diet) that were provided for 6 weeks. A combination of multiplexed mass spectrometry (MS) experiments are used to determine total, isobaric, and position molecules for PC and PE in egg yolk. The distribution of phospholipids in the yolk was predominantly PC over PE (~72 vs. 23%, respectively) across treatments. The longer chain PUFA existed in the sn-2 position in the PC and PE. Although docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) formed isomers with fatty acids 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1; it was preferentially enriched in the egg in combination with 16:0 with both the FO and MA-fed groups in both lipid pools. All 22:6-containing isomers were enriched by ~2-fold more (P < 0.0001) with MA than FO, however, all isomers exhibited a plateau with the FO-fed group. In addition, the MS analyses of PCs revealed several isobaric species containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5), however, in the PE, EPA formed only one isomer (i.e. in combination with 16:0). These results may assist to elucidate potential aspects regulating the limited enrichment of omega-3 PUFA, particularly EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) in chicken eggs.",

In this study, we performed an untargeted mass spectrometry-based profiling of plasma lipids from twenty healthy and twenty hypogonadal men before and after testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for 60 days. Results demonstrated that hypogonadism was associated with a significant increase in sphingomyelin (SM), whereas phosphatidylcholine (PC) was mainly cleaved by activated phospholipase-A2 into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). In hypogonadal patients, arachidonic acid (AA), also produced through the latter cleavage, was prevalently bio-transformed into leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and not into endoperoxides from which prostaglandins and thromboxanes are derived. Interestingly, upon testosterone treatment SM, PC and LPC returned to levels similar to controls. Also, AA was newly converted into prostaglandin-A2, thromboxane-A2 and 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), suggesting that testosterone probably plays a role in controlling hypogonadal alterations above reported.",

It has been reported that dietary DHA-enriched phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) and phosphatidylserine (DHA-PS) could improve brain function. However, it was unclear that whether supplementation of DHA-PC and DHA-PS could change lipid profiles in the brain of dementia animals. METHODS: SAMP8 mice was fed with different diet patterns for 2 months, including high-fat diet and low-fat diet. After intervention with DHA-PC and DHA-PS for another 2 months, the lipid profile in cerebral cortex was determined by lipidomics in dementia mice. RESULTS: High-fat diet could significantly decrease the levels of DHA-containing PS/pPE, DPA-containing PS, and AA-containing PE, which might exhibit the potential of lipid biomarkers for the prevention and diagnosis of AD. Notably, DHA-PC and DHA-PS remarkably recovered the lipid homeostasis in dementia mice. These might provide a potential novel therapy strategy and direction of dietary intervention for patients with cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: DHA-PC and DHA-PS could recover the content of brain DHA-containing PS and pPE in SAMP8 mice fed with high-fat diet.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) and its component phosphatidylcholine (PC) on the brown remodeling of WAT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks and then fed HFD for another 8 weeks with MFGM. In vitro studies were performed in C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and differentiated inguinal WAT stromal vascular cells (SVCs) to determine the role of MFGM and PC on the formation of brown-like adipocytes. MFGM decreased fasting glucose and serum insulin levels in HFD-fed mice. MFGM improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and induced browning of inguinal WAT. MFGM and its component PC stimulated transformation of brown-like adipocytes in C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells, 3T3-L1 adipocytes and SVCs by increasing the protein expression of UCP1, PGC-1α, PRDM16 as well as the mRNA expression of other thermogenic genes and beige cell markers. MFGM and PC also increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, mitochondrial density and oxygen consumption rate and up-regulated the mRNA expression of mitochondria-biogenesis-related genes in vitro. PPARα inhibitor GW6471 treatment or knockdown of PPARα using lentivirus-expressing shRNA inhibited the PC-induced increase in the protein expression of UCP1, PGC-1α and PRDM16 in C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, indicating the potential role of PPARα in PC-mediated brown-like adipocyte formation. In conclusion, MFGM and milk PC induced adipose browning, which has major protective effects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction.",

Earlier research showed that polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC) has hepatoprotective effects and thus can be used for the treatment of NAFLD and the prevention of its progression. Accordingly, the aim of this observational study was to evaluate if PPC administered as adjunctive therapy in routine clinical practice can effectively improve liver function tests of NAFLD in Russian patients with associated metabolic comorbidities. DESIGN: A total of 2843 adult patients with newly diagnosed NAFLD, who had a least one of four comorbidities, namely, overweight/obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolaemia, and who were prescribed 1.8 g/day of PPC as an adjunctive treatment to standard care, were enrolled during 2015-2016. Laboratory data were collected at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks of the study, and included liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)), fasting plasma glucose, and lipid profile. RESULTS: Overall, 2263 patients (79.6%) had at least two metabolic comorbidities associated with NAFLD, and overweight/obesity was the most common comorbidity reported in 2298 (80.8%) patients. At 24 weeks, there was a significant decrease in liver enzyme levels (all p<0.001 compared with baseline). Across the four comorbidity subgroups, there was a mean drop of ALT levels ranging from 19.7 to 22.0 U/L, AST from 16.9 to 18.4 U/L, and GGT from 17.2 to 18.7 U/L. Similar findings were reported in subgroups with either one, two, three, or four comorbidities, with a significant decrease in liver enzyme levels ranging from 18.4 to 22.4 U/L for ALT, 14.8 to 18.7 U/L for AST, and 15.5 to 19.5 U/L for GGT. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant treatment with PPC resulted in consistent improvements in liver enzymes in patients with newly diagnosed NAFLD and associated metabolic comorbidities.

In contrast to many other common mental disorders, there is no drug therapy approved for AN. METHODS: We performed a narrative literature review to consider whether a choline-containing molecule, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), with an omega (ω)-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) could be a potential future medicinal treatment for AN. RESULTS: Choline and LCPUFAs have individually shown benefit for mental health. Case series and pilot studies suggest ω-3 LCPUFAs may be effective in eating disorders. However, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic considerations suggest a greater benefit from the combination of both components. CONCLUSION: The combination of a choline-containing molecule with an ω-3 LCPUFA may be clinically effective and well tolerated. This idea is supported by the current literature on the role of inflammation, the microbiome, the gut-brain-axis, hormonal, neurotransmitter and intracellular signalling, and on the structure and fluidity of nerve cells membranes in patients with AN.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to stabilize loaded celecoxib (CX) by modifying the structure of casein nanoparticles through phosphatidylcholine. The results show that Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine PC98T (PC) significantly increased the stability of CX-PC-casein nanoparticles (NPs) (192.6 nm) from 5 min (CX-β-casein-NPs) to 2.5 h at 37 °C. In addition, the resuspended freeze-dried NPs (202.4 nm) remained stable for 2.5 h. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that PC may block the micropore structures in nanoparticles by ultrasonic treatment and hence improve the physicochemical stability of CX-PC-casein-NPs. The stability of the NPs was positively correlated with their inhibiting ability for human malignant melanoma A375 cells. The structural modification of CX-PC-casein-NPs resulted in an increased intracellular uptake of CX by 2.4 times than that of the unmodified ones. The pharmacokinetic study showed that the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the CX-PC-casein-NPs was 2.9-fold higher in rats than that of the original casein nanoparticles. When CX-PC-casein-NPs were intravenously administrated to mice implanted with A375 tumors (CX dose = 16 mg/kg bodyweight), the tumor inhibition rate reached 56.2%, which was comparable to that of paclitaxel (57.3%) at a dose of 4 mg/kg bodyweight. Our results confirm that the structural modification of CX-PC-casein-NPs can effectively prolong the remaining time of specific drugs, and may provide a potential strategy for cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The concept of using naturally occurring compounds such as polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC) as an adjunctive therapy to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alleviate or reverse hepatic steatosis appears a very attractive option for liver protection. We aim to evaluate if PPC adjunctive therapy can effectively improve the ultrasonographic features of NAFLD in routine clinical practice in Russian patients with cardiometabolic comorbidities. DESIGN: This 24-week, observational, prospective study was carried out in 174 medical sites across 6 federal districts of Russia. A total of 2843 adult patients with newly diagnosed NAFLD, who had a least one of four comorbidities, namely overweight/obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia, and who received PPC as an adjunctive treatment to standard care, were enrolled. The assessment of liver ultrasonography was qualitative. RESULTS: Overall, 2263 (79.6%) patients had at least two metabolic comorbidities associated with NAFLD, and overweight/obesity was the most common comorbidity reported in 2298 (80.8%) patients. Almost all study participants (2837/2843; 99.8%) were prescribed 1.8 g of PPC administered three times daily. At baseline, the most frequently identified abnormalities on ultrasound were liver hyperechogenicity (84.0% of patients) and heterogeneous liver structure (62.9%). At 24 weeks, a significant (p<0.05) improvement in liver echogenicity and in liver structure was observed in 1932/2827 (68.3%) patients (95% CI 66.6% to 70.1%) and in 1207/2827 (42.7%) patients (95% CI 40.9% to 44.5%), respectively. The analysis of ultrasonographic signs by number of comorbidities revealed similar findings-liver echogenicity improved in 67.2%-69.3% and liver structure in 35.6%-45.3% of patients depending on the number of comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This study showed that PPC adjunctive therapy may be useful in improving the ultrasonographic features of NAFLD in patients with associated cardiometabolic comorbidities. It also supports evidence regarding the role of PPC in the complex management of NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The timely diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is of utmost importance due to the need to institute antibiotic treatment as early as possible. Moreover, the differentiation from other causes of meningitis/encephalitis is critical because of differences in management such as the need for antiviral or immunosuppressive treatments. Considering our previously reported association between free membrane phospholipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and CNS involvement in neuroinfections we evaluated phosphatidylcholine PC ae C44:6, an integral constituent of cell membranes, as diagnostic biomarker for bacterial meningitis. METHODS: We used tandem mass spectrometry to measure concentrations of PC ae C44:6 in cell-free CSF samples (n = 221) from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, neuroborreliosis, viral meningitis/encephalitis (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, enteroviruses), autoimmune neuroinflammation (anti-NMDA-receptor autoimmune encephalitis, multiple sclerosis), facial nerve and segmental herpes zoster (shingles), and noninflammatory CNS disorders (Bell's palsy, Tourette syndrome, normal pressure hydrocephalus). RESULTS: PC ae C44:6 concentrations were significantly higher in bacterial meningitis than in all other diagnostic groups, and were higher in patients with a classic bacterial meningitis pathogen (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus) than in those with less virulent or opportunistic pathogens as causative agents (P = 0.026). PC ae C44:6 concentrations were only moderately associated with CSF cell count (Spearman's ρ = 0.45; P = 0.009), indicating that they do not merely reflect neuroinflammation. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, PC ae C44:6 equaled CSF cell count in the ability to distinguish bacterial meningitis from viral meningitis/encephalitis and autoimmune CNS disorders (AUC 0.93 both), but had higher sensitivity (91% vs. 41%) and negative predictive value (98% vs. 89%). A diagnostic algorithm comprising cell count, lactate and PC ae C44:6 had a sensitivity of 97% (specificity 87%) and negative predictive value of 99% (positive predictive value 61%) and correctly diagnosed three of four bacterial meningitis samples that were misclassified by cell count and lactate due to low values not suggestive of bacterial meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CSF PC ae C44:6 concentrations in bacterial meningitis likely reflect ongoing CNS cell membrane stress or damage and have potential as additional, sensitive biomarker to diagnose bacterial meningitis in patients with less pronounced neuroinflammation.",

Herein, we report our work in the discovery of novel drug-like PC-PLC inhibitors. Virtual screening led to the identification of promising hits from four different structural series that contain the molecular scaffold of benzenesulphonamides (10), pyrido[3,4-b]indoles (22), morpholinobenzoic acid (84) and benzamidobenzoic acid (80). 164 structural analogues were tested to investigate the chemical space around the hit series and to generate preliminary structurally activity relationships (SAR). Two of the pyrido[3,4-b]indoles (22_10 and 22_15) had comparable or better potency as D609, an established but non-drug-like PC-PLC inhibitor. Furthermore, three morpholinobenzoic acids (84, 84_4 and 84_5) had superior potency than D609. Therefore, this study paves the way towards the development of drug-like PL-PLC inhibitors as potential anticancer agents.",

There are currently no methods for detection of minute levels of these phospholipids or simultaneously with products of the utilization of these phospholipid substrates by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes. To examine the substrate utilization of PE and PC by PLA2, we developed a method to accurately detect and measure specific forms of PE and PC as low as 50 femtomoles. Validation of this method consisted of an enzymatic assay to monitor docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid release from the hydrolysis of PE and PC by group IV phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) coupled to the generation of lyso-PE (LPE) and lyso-PC (LPC). In addition, the PE and PC profiles of RAW 264.7 macrophages were monitored with zymosan/lipopolysaccharide-treatment. Finally, genetic validation for the specificity of the method consisted of the downregulation of two biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the production of PE and PC, choline kinase A (CHKA) and ethanolamine kinase 1 (ETNK1). This new UPLC ESI-MS/MS method provides accurate and highly sensitive detection of PE and PC species containing AA and DHA allowing for the specific examination of the substrate utilization of these phospholipids by PLA2 in vitro and in cells."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major surface-active phospholipid and creates a hydrophobic nature to the surface. It has been reported to reverse the progression of liver fibrosis and to improve liver function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of orally administered PC on intestinal barrier function (IBF) in rats with drug-induced liver injury. METHOD: Rats with carbon tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced liver injury were treated with 100 mg/kg PC once daily for 21 days. The effects of PC therapy on (i) liver function and portal pressure, (ii) intestinal and hepatic histology, and (iii) plasma endotoxin, diamine oxidase (DAO), and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) α levels were investigated. RESULTS: PC therapy reduced portal pressure and improved the liver function in CCl4-induced liver injury. In PC-treated liver injury rats, collagen fibres were gradually decreased, while the disordered arrangement of hepatocytes and disorganized hepatic lobules were partially repaired, and inflammatory cell infiltration was decreased in the fibrous tissue. Lower inflammatory cell infiltration in the ileum improved intestinal histology, and reduced serum DAO levels were observed in PC-treated cirrhotic rats. These changes were associated with reduced inflammatory activity, as indicated by decreased serum TNF-α levels and plasma endotoxin levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PC therapy is hepatoprotective and is able to restore IBF and reduce endotoxaemia in rats with drug-induced liver injury."
