      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain (NP) consists of a range of unpleasant sensations attributed to a lesion or a disease of the somatosensory nervous system. It is important to note that the sensations initiated by NP are debilitating and adversely affect quality of life; however, the underlying mechanisms involved in the occurrence and development of this type of pain remain to be determined. Previously data demonstrated that inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway diminished the adverse consequences attributed to NP. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine whether saponins derived from Tribulus terrestris might exert an analgesic effect on NP in rats using a chronic constriction injury (CCI) involving sciatic nerve. Male rats were randomly divided into Sham, CCI, low 100 mg/kg T. terrestris, high 200 mg/kg T. terrestris, and compared to pregabalin 10 mg/kg, the recognized first line of defense in NP. Three days after surgery, rats were treated with sham control (water) or drugs. The paw mechanical withdrawal threshold (PMWT) and thermal latency (TL) of rats were measured 1 day before operation and 3, 7, and 10 days after. Nissl staining was used to observe the morphology and Western Blot to detect protein expression of NF-κB and TLR4 on the 10th day after operation. ELISA was employed to detect levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-ɑ in spinal cord. CCI significantly decreased PMWT and TL. In CCI neurons and glial cells in the spinal dorsal horn were deeply stained with swelling and atrophy observed. The protein expression levels of NF-κB and TLR4 in the spinal dorsal horn of the injured side were significantly increased accompanied by elevated levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-ɑ. Treatment with low 100 mg/kg or high 200 mg/kg T. terrestris or pregabalin reduced effects of CCI on PMW, TL, histopathological changes as well as levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 associated with inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Data suggest that T. terrest exerts an analgesic effect on peripheral NP which involves TLR4/NF-κB pathway inhibition."

      "abstract": "The whole plant of Tribulus terrestris (TT) is used to treat hypertension and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. The harvest time has an important influence on the quality of medicinal plants. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of harvest time on the content of components in different parts of TT and compare the antihypertensive effect of different parts of TT at harvest time with a relatively high content of 14 components. Ultraviolet-visible spectrometry (UV-Vis spectrometry) was used to determine the total saponin content in T. terrestris fruit (TTF), T. terrestris stems (TTS), and T. terrestris leaves (TTL) at different harvest times. Within the studied harvest times, the total saponin content was higher in TTL than in TTF or TTS. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed significant differences in the spatial and temporal differences in the content of 14 components in the three plant parts. The multivariate statistical analysis identified six components as markers of different TT content in the different parts. The suitable TTF harvest period was from August 11 to September 1, while TTS and TTL were suitable for harvesting from July 21 to September 11. The treatment effects on blood pressure, serum indexes, and thoracic aorta morphology confirmed that the antihypertensive effects of TTL were better than those of TTF or TTS. The study emphasized the effect of harvest time on the content of components in different parts of TT and confirmed that TTS and TTL also had medicinal value.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris L. from the family of Zygophyllaceae, which is rich in saponin compounds, especially diosgenin, has various biological properties, such as anti-inflammation, anti-Alzheimer, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, anti-leukemia, and anti-cancer activities, due to these compounds. This research aimed to study the diversity of agro-morphological and phytochemical traits and anti-proliferative activity against human prostate cancer cells (PC3) of T. terrestris collected from 24 geographical regions in Iran and to select the superior populations for future domestication and breeding projects. The highest coefficient of variations was related to the fruit dry weight (104.77%), shoot dry weight (104.62%), and leaf dry weight (99.83%). Maximum plant height (113.96 cm), leaf length (49.39 mm), leaf width (23.48 mm), fruit diameter (11.42 mm), and fruit dry weight (34.11 g/plant) were recorded in SBU population. Gallic acid, 3.4dhb, rutin, salicylic acid, quercetin, kaempferol, apigenin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumarin, ferulic acid, and rosmarinic acid were identified as the main phenolic compounds by HPLC. The highest total saponin content was observed in the RAF population (9.46 µg OCE/g DW) and the lowest in the KER population (4.75 µg OCE/g DW). The minimum (0.65 mg/g DW) and maximum (7.49 mg/g DW) diosgenin content was observed in KHA and PAN populations, respectively. The results of the MTT assay demonstrated the significant anti-proliferative activity of the T. terrestris extracts against the PC3 cancer cell line. IC50 calculated for the T. terrestris extracts in the 24-h treatment was from 15.02 to 27.11 µg/ml, implying that all samples had considerable cytotoxicity activity against the PC3 cells. The diversity observed among the T. terrestris populations in the studied traits shows its high potential for selecting and using the best populations in domestication, breeding, and cultivation projects.",

      "abstract": "Among the numerous treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the promotion of synoviocyte apoptosis and inhibition of inflammation are considered the most effective. However, the potential pro-apoptotic effects of gross saponins of Tribulus terrestris (GSTT), which are natural saponins derived from the herb Tribulus terrestris L., on rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) and their essential molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of different concentrations of GSTT on RA-FLSs using various assays, including cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) and western blot analysis. These assessments were conducted to evaluate the cell viability, changes in the levels of inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis rates and alterations in protein expression related to this process. In vivo, arthritis clinical score, haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and ELISA were used to assess paw inflammation, histopathology and serum inflammatory cytokine changes. Our findings demonstrated that GSTT substantially promotes the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. GSTT also reduced the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and inhibited JNK and p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, GSTT exhibits positive effects on RA by improving clinical scores, reducing synovial inflammatory infiltration and lowering serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Therefore, by promoting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and suppressing inflammation through the inhibition of the MAPK signalling pathway, GSTT is a promising therapeutic intervention for RA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carboplatin, a second-generation platinum-containing compound is associated with renal tubular injury and hepatic damage in cancer patients. Tribulus terrestris (TT) is widely used in Indian traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aimed to evaluate TT's beneficial effects against liver and kidney damage induced by carboplatin. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: An in-vivo study was conducted on thirty rats. All the groups, except the control, received intraperitoneal carboplatin 90 mg/kg on day 5; the three treatment groups received TT extract (1 g/kg, 1.25, and 1.5 g/kg) for 14 days. Serum and tissue parameters for liver functions, kidney functions, oxidative stress, and inflammatory marker interleukin 6 were measured along with histopathological assessment. FINDINGS/RESULTS: TT at 1.5 g/kg on day 14 significantly reduced creatinine and aspartate transaminase levels compared to the carboplatin group. The increase in malondialdehyde levels and decrease in glutathione levels was significantly reversed in the groups treated with TT 1.25 and 1.5 g/kg. Interleukin 6 showed a significant decrease in treatment groups when compared to the carboplatin group. Carboplatin distorted hepatic architecture and caused diffused inflammatory cell infiltration in the peritubular interstitial spaces in the kidney. The histopathological evaluation confirmed that TT extract ameliorated hepatic and kidney damage by restoring to normal architecture. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Aqueous extract of TT demonstrated a therapeutic effect against nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity caused by carboplatin. The observed benefits can be attributed to its anti-inflammatory action and antioxidant properties."

      "abstract": "Plants of the genus Tribulus have been used in folk medicine for wound healing, alleviating liver, stomach, and rheumatism pains, and as cognitive enhancers, sedatives, antiseptics, tonics, and stimulants. The present work aimed to evaluate whether Tribulus terrestris (Tt) administered for 15 days attenuated cognitive deficits and exhibited anxiolytic and antidepressant profiles in scopolamine-induced amnesia in zebrafish. Animals were randomly divided into six groups (eight animals per group): (1)-(3) Tt treatment groups (1, 3 and 6 mg/L), (4) control, (5) scopolamine (SCOP, 0.7 mg/kg), and (6) galantamine (Gal, 1 mg/L). Exposure to SCOP (100 µM) resulted in anxiety in zebrafish, as assessed by the novel tank diving test (NTT) and novel approach test (NAT). When zebrafish were given SCOP and simultaneously given Tt (1, 3, and 6 mg/L once daily for 10 days), the deficits were averted. Molecular interactions of chemical compounds from the Tt fractions with the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) were investigated via molecular docking experiments. Using behavioral experiments, we showed that administration of Tt induces significant anxiolytic-antidepressant-like effects in SCOP-treated zebrafish. Our result indicated that flavonoids of Tt, namely kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin, apigetrin, and epigallocatechin, could act as promising phytopharmaceuticals for improving anxiety-related disorders."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tribulus terrestris, a plant known for its pharmacological properties, was investigated in this study for its potential anticancer effects against oral cancer cells. The study aimed to explore the phytochemical composition of T. terrestris seed extract and evaluate its cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic seed extracts of T. terrestris were obtained and subjected to phytochemical analysis to identify bioactive compounds. The cytotoxic effect of the extract on oral cancer cells was evaluated using the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, while pro-apoptotic effects were assessed through dual fluorescent staining. Antioxidant activity was measured using hydrogen peroxide and erythrocyte aggregation assays, while anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated through inhibition of albumin denaturation. RESULTS: Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, and phenols in T. terrestris seed extract. The extract demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against oral cancer cells, with 100 μg/mL showing significant growth inhibition. Pro-apoptotic effects were observed, with characteristic morphological changes in cancer cells treated with the extract. Antioxidant activity was demonstrated by the extract, with methanol fraction of a flower (MFF) exhibiting the highest capacity, followed by total trichome fraction (TTF), and a positive correlation between phenolic content and free radical scavenging effectiveness was noted. Antimicrobial activity against various pathogens, including bacteria and fungi, was also observed, with higher concentrations showing increased efficacy. CONCLUSION: The study concludes that methanolic extracts of T. terrestris possess significant anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. These findings highlight the potential of T. terrestris as a candidate for further research and clinical applications, either alone or in combination with other agents, for the treatment of oral cancer and associated conditions."

      "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are commonly utilized in the medical sector, particularly in cardiovascular applications. Nevertheless, there is a studies scarcity examining the impact of AgNPs on myocardial infarction protection. A green formulation of AgNPs was documented in the research. Different spectroscopic methods were utilized to examine the AgNPs, and their potential for treating myocardial infarction was explored. The NPs exhibited a spherical morphology upon formation. Isoproterenol (85 mg/kg) was administered to induce myocardial infarction in mice. The mice were categorized into four distinct groups (n = 15): (1) untreated; (2) normal; (3,4) AgNPs + isoproterenol at various doses (5 and 50 µg/kg). The activation of PPAR-Υ/NF-κB and subsequent cytokine release induced by lipopolysaccharide were quantified using real-time PCR and western blot techniques. Subsequent to the administration of AgNPs at different doses, the evaluation of cardiac function was conducted through biochemical, histochemical, and electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. AgNPs significantly inhibit the levels of myocardial injury markers, reduce the incidence of mortality, and improve the condition of ventricular wall infarction. In addition, the administration of AgNPs effectively prevents the characteristic ST segment depression when compared to animals with myocardial infarction. The positive effects of AgNPs could potentially be attributed to the restoration of normal gene expression in PPAR-Υ/NF-κB/ΙκB-α/ΙΚΚα/β and PPAR-Υ phosphorylation pathways. Additionally, the application of AgNPs led to a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hearts of mice suffering from myocardial infarction. The expression suppression of inflammation cytokines and cell death was significantly reduced by AgNPs. Recent findings suggest that AgNPs possess cardioprotective properties on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction, possibly by the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and activation of PPAR-γ. To summarize, the present study introduces a contemporary therapeutic approach for treating myocardial infarction in clinical settings.",

The groups included young, old, old bindii (200 mg/kg), old exercise, and old bindii exercise (concurrent swimming training). All interventions were performed within 14 days. The animals' spatial memory was evaluated by the Y maze, radial maze, and shuttle box, Oxidative stress factors were also measured. RESULTS: Compared to the old control group, the bindii extract along with swimming exercise significantly increased the periodic behavior percentage in the Y maze and the delay time in entry into the dark chamber in the shuttle box but no significant difference was seen in the reference memory error in the radial maze. Also, a significant increase in the amount of catalase (CAT) and antioxidant capacity (TAC) and a significant decrease in the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) were observed in all treatment groups. CONCLUSION: These results show that exercise, along with the bindii extract consumption, can improve spatial and avoidance memory in old rats probably through the reduction of oxidative stress effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Nitric oxide is the most important mediator of penile erection after the onset of sexual excitement. It activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), increasing penile blood flow. Most pharmaceutical medications prevent enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) from breaking down cGMP, thus keeping its level high. However, due to the adverse effects of pharmacological therapies, herbal drugs that improve sexual function have gained attention recently. This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of ginseng, Tribulus terrestris, and L-arginine amino acid on the sexual performance of individuals with erectile dysfunction (ED) using the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire. METHODS: Over three months, 98 men with erectile dysfunction were randomly assigned to receive either 500 mg of herbal supplements or placebo pills. Each herbal tablet contained 100 mg of protodioscin, 35 mg of ginsenosides, and 250 mg of L-arginine. RESULTS: The results showed that the changes in the average scores of ILEF-5 within each group before and after the intervention indicated that all parameters related to the improvement of sexual function in patients with erectile dysfunction improved in the herbal treatment group (p < 0.001). The herbal group significantly improved IIEF-5 scores in non-diabetics (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the changes of IIEF-5 scores between the two intervention and control groups in diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, ginseng, Tribulus terrestris, and L-arginine have properties that increase energy and strengthen sexual function, making them suitable for patients with sexual disorders."

(TT) is extensively documented in the Tibetan medical literature 'Si Bu Yi Dian', has been used to treat diabetes mellitus for more than a thousand years. However, the underlying mechanisms and comprehensive effects of TT on diabetes have yet to be investigated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to systemically elucidate the potential mechanisms of TT in treating diabetes mellitus, and further investigate the therapeutic effects of the water extract, small molecular components and saccharides from TT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal metabolomics was employed to draw the metabolic profile based on UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16S rRNA gene were amplified to explore the structural changes of the intestinal microbiome after TT intervention and to analyze the differential microbiota. The microbial metabolites SCFAs were determined by GC-MS, and the BAs and tryptophan metabolites were quantified by UPLC-TQ-MS. Spearman correlation analysis was carried out to comprehensively investigate the relationship among the endogenous metabolites profile, intestinal microbiota and their metabolites. RESULTS: TT exhibited remarkably therapeutic effect on T2DM rats, as evidenced by improved glucolipid metabolism and intestinal barrier integrity, ameliorated inflammation and remission in insulin resistance. A total of 24 endogenous biomarkers were screened through fecal metabolomics studies, which were mainly related to tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and arachidonic acid metabolism. Investigations on microbiomics revealed that TT significantly modulated 18 differential bacterial genera and reversed the disordered gut microbial in diabetes rats. Moreover, TT notably altered the content of gut microbiota metabolites, both in serum and fecal samples. Significant correlation among microbial community, metabolites and T2DM-related indicators was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: The multiple components of TT regulate the metabolic homeostasis of the organism and the balance of intestinal microbiota and its metabolites, which might mediate the anti-diabetic capacity of TT.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus Terrestris (TT) is a common herbal plant with different categories that grows in many countries of the world. Traditional Chinese and Indian therapies have used TT for infertility treatment and also as a powerful antioxidant agent. Therefore, this study aimed to use this plant supplemented with vitamin E to study their combined effects on the histological condition of the testicle and epididymis of rabbits. This study was performed on 28 healthy male rabbits (445-950 g, 2.0-3.0 months old) that were randomly divided into four groups (n=7). All animals were subjected to clinical examination to ensure that they were free of external and internal parasites with the use of some preventive treatments. The animals were housed individually (cage size: 50 cm×50 cm×40 cm) over the 60-day study period starting from January 2022, with an adaptation period of two weeks. Tribulus Terrestris and vitamin E treatments were as follows: the first group (G1) was daily fed on a standard diet and kept as the control group, the second group (G2) was daily fed on the same ration plus 1 g of TT (animal/daily), the third group (G3) was daily fed on the same ration plus 1 g of TT supplemented with 60 mg of vitamin E (orally) (animal /daily), and the fourth group (G4) was daily fed on the same ration, with the addition of 60 mg vitamin E per animal (orally). The morphometric investigation, macroscopic variables (including body weight, testicular weight, and volume), and the microscopic parameters of the testicular seminal tubule were measured. The histological section showed the absence of negative effects after the oral administration of TT at a dose of 1 g per day and 60 IU vitamin E for each animal. However, there was a positive effect on spermatogonia and spermatocytes in all animals, while the spermatogonia in the experimental groups were more dense, especially in the second and third groups, compared to the control group. The seminiferous tubules were significantly lined with spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids (P<0.5) in the experimental groups, compared to the control group. Nevertheless, the epididymis tissue did not show traces of histological changes, such as epididymal hyperplasia. Sperms were more frequent in the lumens of the epididymis as well as the lumens larger than those of the control. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the pole plant and vitamin E have a positive effect on the epithelial lining of the seminiferous tubules and the epididymis with an increase in sperm formation and differentiation towards maturity.",

This study aimed to investigate the related mechanisms in vitro. The lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 cells model was constructed and treated with gross saponins at different concentrations to explore its anti-inflammatory activity. The cell metabolite changes were tracked by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics, and the metabolic biomarkers and related metabolic pathways were analyzed. Molecular biochemistry analysis was further used to verify the relevant inflammatory pathways. The results showed that the saponins reduced nitric oxide release and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 from lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 cells. Metabolic perturbations occurred in lipopolysaccharide-treated BV2 cells, which could be reversed by drug treatment via mainly regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, purine metabolism pathways, etc. The western blot analysis demonstrated that saponin could suppress the activation of the inflammatory-related signaling pathway. The present study explored the in vitro anti-inflammatory mechanism of gross saponins of Tribulus terrestris L. fruit using an LC-MS-based cell metabolomics approach, which confirms the great potential of LC-MS for drug efficacy evaluation and can be applied in other herbal medicine-related analyses.",

The previous studies demonstrate the protective effect of gross saponins of TT (GSTTF) on ischemic stroke. However, the mechanism by which GSTTF protects against ischemic stroke is still unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study applies molecular biology and unbiased transcriptomics to explore the pathways and targets underlying the therapeutic impact of GSTTF in treating ischemic stroke. The mRNA of brain tissues from different groups is analyzed using a transcriptomics method. The data reveal that treatment with GSTTF significantly reduces elevated CRP, IL-6, and Ca2+ levels induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). A total of 61 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified, GSTTF is found to effectively reverse the abnormal mRNA expression levels in rat brain tissues affected by ischemic stroke models. These positive effects of GSTTF are likely achieved through the suppression of calcium ion and the MyD88/IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers the mechanisms behind the efficacy of GSTTF in treating ischemic stroke, which not only expands its potential medicinal applications but also confirmed its potential as a dietary supplement.",

In addition, testicles were collected and processed for histomorphometrical analyses. Data were compared using the Student's t -test and considered significant when P < 0.05. Spermatozoa concentration, motility, and viability showed no difference between the groups. Further, testicular weight and volume, seminiferous tubule diameter, tunica propria surface density, seminiferous epithelium surface density, and intertubular compartment surface density were statistically similar between the groups. However, seminiferous epithelium height and tubular lumen surface density were augmented in animals treated with Tt. Treatment with Tt does not cause a major impact on testicular morphology, promoting only subtle modifications. No difference on spermatozoa parameters was observed.",

(TT) was initially documented in Shen-Nong-Ben-Cao-Jing and has been used for thousands of years in China as a herb to calm liver, dispel melancholy and wind, promote blood circulation, improve eyesight, and relieve itching. Moreover, it was also used to treat breast cancer in ancient China. However, the pharmacological activities of TT extract on breast cancer have received little attention. PURPOSE: In this study, we investigated the anti-breast cancer effects and possible mechanisms of action of this herbal drug. METHODS: Network pharmacology analysis the study of network pharmacology was done to analyze the possibility of TT's anti-breast cancer effect. And then, molecular docking between TT7/TT8 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) were performed by Autodock software as well as the related protein expressions were analyzed by western blot to verify this effect. In vivo experiment: The mouse model of breast cancer was established by injection of 4T1 cells. Then drugs were intragastrically administered to the mice once daily for fourteen days. Body weight, tumor size, and tumor weight were recorded at the end of the experiment. Moreover, tumor inhibitory rate was calculated. Finally, pathological changes and apoptosis of breast cancer tissues were respectively evaluated by HE and Hoechst staining. Proteomics and metabonomics analyses: The tumor tissues were chosen to perform conjoint analysis. Firstly, differential proteins and metabolites were found. Furthermore, the functional analyses of them were analyzed by software. At the last, immunofluorescent staining of SGPP1, SPHK1 and p-SPHK1 in tumor tissue were done. RESULTS: 12 active ingredients of TT, 127 targets of active ingredients, 15,253 targets of breast cancer, 1,225 targets of Ru yan, and 123 overlapping genes were obtained in the network pharmacology study. There was firm conjunction between TT7/TT8 and VEGFR2. Besides, tumor size and weight were markedly reduced in TT groups compared to the model group. The tumor inhibitory rate was more than 26% in TTM group. After drug treatment, many adipocytes and cracks between tumor and apoptosis were discovered. The western blot results showed that TT aqueous extract lowered the levels of VEGFR2, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 (Thr202, Tyr204) and Bcl2, while increasing the levels of Bax and the ratio of Bax/Bcl2. Furthermore, 495 differential proteins and 76 differential metabolites were found between TTM and model groups with the sphingolipid metabolism pathway being enriched. At last, TT treatment significantly reduced the levels of SGPP1, SPHK1 and p-SPHK1 in tumor tissue. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, TT demonstrates therapeutic effects in a mouse model of breast cancer, and its mechanism of action involves the regulations of sphingolipid metabolism signaling pathways. This study lends credence to the pharmacological potential of TT extract as a breast cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tribulus terrestris L. (TT) is one of the most common Chinese herbs and distributes in various regions in China. TT was first documented to treat breast cancer in Shen-Nong-Ben-Cao-Jing. However, the pharmacological activities of TT extract on liver cancer have not been reported. In this study, we investigated its anti-liver cancer activity and underlying mechanism. METHODS: Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and PharmMapper databases were used to obtain the active ingredients and the targets of TT. Genecards database was employed to acquire TT targets in liver cancer. Furthermore, Venny 2.1, Cytoscape 3.8.2, DAVID 6.8 software were utilized to analyze the relationship between TT and liver cancer. In vivo experiment: The animal model of liver cancer was established by injection of H22 cells into Balb/c mice. After five days, drugs were intragastrically administered to the mice daily for 10 days. Body weight, tumor size and tumor weight were recorded. Tumor inhibitory rate was calculated. Protein levels were examined by Western blotting. Pathological changes of liver cancer tissues were evaluated by HE and Tunel staining. Metabolomics study: LC-MS was used to analyze different metabolites between model and TTM groups. RESULTS: 12 active ingredients of TT, 127 targets of active ingredients, 17,378 targets of liver cancer, and 125 overlapping genes were obtained. And then, 118 items of GO biological processes (BP), 54 items of GO molecular function (MF), 35 items of GO cellular component (CC) and 128 pathways of KEGG were gotten (P < 0.05). Moreover, 47 differential metabolites were affirmed and 66 pathways of KEGG (P < 0.05) were obtained. In addition, after TT and sorafenib treatment, tumor size was markedly reduced, respectively, compared with model group. Tumor weight was significantly decreased and tumor inhibitory rate was more than 44% in TTM group. After TT treatment, many adipocytes, cracks between tumor cells and apoptosis were found. The levels of pro-Cathepsin B, Cathepsin B, Bax, Bax/Bcl2, Caspase3 and Caspase7 were markedly increased, but the level of Bcl2 was significantly reduced after TT treatment. CONCLUSION: TT has a broad range of effects on various signaling pathways and biological processes, including the regulation of apoptosis. It exhibits antitumor activity in an animal model of liver cancer and activates the apoptotic pathway by decreasing Sph level. This study provides valuable information regarding the potential use of TT extract in the treatment of liver cancer and highlights the importance of investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms of traditional medicines for the development of new therapeutic drugs in liver cancer."

      "abstract": "Green synthesis is the most effective and environmentally friendly way to produce nanoparticles. The present research aimed at the biosynthesizing of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Tribulus terrestris seed extract as the reducing and stabilizing agent and investigating their anti-diabetic properties. Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-Vis spectroscopy were used to analyze the synthesized silver nanoparticles from Tribulus terrestris (TT-AgNPs). The spectroscopic characterization revealed a surface Plasmon resonance band at 380 nm, which verified the development of TT-AgNPs. The transmittance peaks were observed at 596, 1450, 1631, 2856, 2921, and 3422 cm-1 through the FTIR spectrophotometer. The XRD spectrum showed four distinct diffraction peaks in the 2θ range at 20° to 60°. Intense peaks were at 26.32°, 30.70°, 44.70°, 56.07°, 53.75°, 66.28°, and 75.32°. The SEM analysis revealed that the prepared TT-AgNPs were clustered loosely with a smooth and spherical structure and were of relatively uniform size. The in vitro antidiabetic potential of TT-AgNPs was assessed by using glucose yeast uptake, glucose adsorption, and alpha-amylase assays. TT-AgNPs showed the highest activity (78.45 ± 0.84%) of glucose uptake by yeast at 80 µg/mL. In the glucose adsorption assay, the highest activity of TT-AgNPs was 10.40 ± 0.52% at 30 mM, while in the alpha-amylase assay, TT-AgNPs exhibited the maximum activity of 75.68 ± 0.11% at 100 µg/mL. The results indicate a substantial anti-diabetic effect of the TT-AgNPs. Furthermore, the in vivo antidiabetic study was performed on TT-AgNPs in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. After receiving TT-AgNPs treatment for 30 days, the mice were sacrificed for biochemical and histological analyses of pancreatic and liver samples, which demonstrated a good improvement when compared to the control group. Mice treated with TT-AgNPs showed a significant drop in blood sugar levels, showing that the biosynthesized TT-AgNPs have effective anti-diabetic properties.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris L. fruit (TT) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine used to treat ischemic stroke (IS). This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of TT extract, named TT15, on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats using metabolomics and molecular docking and find the targets of action and the material basis of TT15 against IS. The results of the infarct volume and neurological defect scores confirmed the efficacy of TT15. Serum metabolomics analysis using LC-MS revealed that model group animals experienced a variety of metabolic disturbances when compared to the sham group. TT15 can restore the MCAO-induced serum metabolite changes by modulating multiple metabolic pathways. Six enzymes were highlighted by the metabolite-reaction-enzyme-gene (M-R-E-G) network analysis, which might be the possible targets for the TT15 against IS. Molecular docking analysis was applied to show the binding affinities between active compounds and these enzymes. The representative docking mode with the lowest binding energy between three compounds and phospholipase A 2 (PLA2) and peroxidase (POD) was displayed by the ribbon binding map. This study profiles the metabolic changes in MCAO-induced IS and investigates the efficacy and the corresponding mechanism of TT15 in the treatment of IS.",

      "abstract": "Obesity, and its consequences for human health, is a huge and complicated problem that has no simple solution. The constant search for natural and safe compounds with systemic action that can be used for obesity prophylactics and treatment is hampered by the limited availability and variable quality of biomass of wild medicinal plants. Plant cell biotechnology is an alternative approach for the sustainable production of vegetative biomass or individual phytochemicals with high therapeutic potential. In this study, the suspension cell biomass of the medicinal plants, Dioscorea deltoidea Wall., Tribulus terrestris L., and Panax japonicus (T. Nees) C.A. Mey, produced in 20 L and 630 L bioreactors, were tested for therapeutic effects in rat models with alimentary-induced obesity. Three-month intake of water infusions of dry cell biomass (100 mg/g body weight) against the background of a hypercaloric diet reduced weight gain and the proportion of fat mass in the obese animals. In addition, cell biomass preparation reduced the intracellular dehydration and balanced the amounts of intra- and extracellular fluids in the body as determined by bioimpedance spectroscopy. A significant decrease in the glucose and cholesterol levels in the blood was also observed as a result of cell biomass administration for all species. Hypocholesterolemic activity reduced in the line P. japonicus > D. deltoidea > T. terrestris/liraglutide > intact group > control group. By the sum of parameters tested, the cell culture of D. deltoidea was considered the most effective in mitigating diet-induced obesity, with positive effects sometimes exceeding those of the reference drug liraglutide. A safety assessment of D. deltoidea cell phytopreparation showed no toxic effect on the reproductive function of the animals and their offspring. These results support the potential application of the biotechnologically produced cell biomass of medicinal plant species as safe and effective natural remedies for the treatment of obesity and related complications, particularly for the long-term treatment and during pregnancy and lactation periods when conventional treatment is often contraindicated.",

However, its protective effect on ischemic stroke has yet to be fully investigated. In this study, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was established and treated with gross saponin of TT fruit (GSTTF) by gavage to explore its anti-ischemic stroke efficacy. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics was applied to profile the brain tissue metabolite changes and further obtain the metabolic pathways that were greatly involved in the efficacy of GSTTF. Subsequent molecular biology experiments were applied to validate the findings from metabolomics analysis. The results showed that GSTTF administration remarkably decreased the infarction volume of brain tissue and improved the neurobehavioral scores of MCAO rats. Metabolomics analysis revealed that pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism, were considered associated with the protective effect of GSTTF against MCAO, which were greatly involved in the inflammatory responses. The results of the biochemistry analysis showed that GSTTF treatment significantly reduced the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in brain tissue after MCAO. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of GSTTF was further investigated, which revealed that GSTTF could inhibit the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway to exert protective effects on MCAO. This study provides the underlying anti-inflammatory mechanism of GSTTF for ischemic stroke protection, which has important implications for the development of GSTTF-related functional foods or food supplements."

Thirty trained male CrossFit® athletes were randomly assigned to be supplemented with 770 mg/day of TT (intervention group (IG)) or receive a placebo daily (control group (CG)) for 6 weeks. Muscle damage enzymes, inflammation biomarkers, and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) were assessed at baseline (T1), 21 days after baseline (T2), and after 42 days (T3). Grace, a Workout of the Day, was measured in T1 and T3. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was found between IG and CG in Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and TAS levels at the end of the follow-up. Furthermore, TAS levels were significantly (p < 0.05) lower at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the IG, also LDH and CRP increased significantly (p < 0.05) at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the CG. No significant (p > 0.05) decreases in muscle damage or inflammation biomarkers were observed, although a slight downward trend was observed after 6 weeks for supplemented athletes. TT supplementation could attenuate the CrossFit® training program-induced oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammation which could be due to the natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of TT.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris L. is an annual herbaceous medicinal plant of Zygophyllaceae, which is cultivated commercially in China. Subrotund or irregular gray, sunken, necrotic spots ranging from 2 to 9 mm were observed on diseased leaves of T. terrestris landrace in Fushun County, Liaoning Province of northeast China in July 2021, with more than 32% of the plants being infected in a 18-ha field. The symptoms first appeared on older leaves and gradually spread to younger leaves. The lesions developed a white center gradually and became perforated; multiple lesions could coalesce (Fig. 1). Ten symptomatic leaves were collected and the diseased tissues were cut into small pieces, immersed in 1% NaOCl for 2 min, rinsed three times with sterile water, and placed on acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA) in Petri dishes at 25°C in darkness. Fifteen suspected Colletotrichum single-spore fungal isolates (JL1 to JL15) with consistent morphological characteristics were obtained, and isolate JL6 was selected for identification and pathogenicity testing. Colonies on PDA were flat with an entire margin, dense and white at first, then became dark gray with numerous black microsclerotia and formed a concentric circular pattern with aging. Conidia were single-celled, sickle-curved with a tapered tip and truncate base, ranging from 16.46 to 20.26 μm in length and 2.81 to 3.96 μm in width (n=100). Setae were dark brown, septate, straight with a slightly acute tip, 75.45 to 135.63×3.19 to 4.95 μm in size. Appressoria were dark brown, round or irregular, mostly in groups. All characteristics were consistent with the descriptions of C. truncatum (Damm et al. 2009). Further confirmation of the identification was determined according to methods described previously (Damm et al. 2009). The rDNA internal transcribed spacer region (OP364400, 585 bp), and actin (OP380867, 290 bp), beta-tubulin (OP380868, 498 bp), chitin synthase 1 (OP380869, 277 bp), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (OP380870, 280 bp), and histone (OP380871, 411 bp) genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced (Carbone and Kohn 1999; Glass and& Donaldson 1995; Guerber et al. 2003; O'Donnell and Cigelnik 1997). BLAST results showed 98-100% similarity at 85-97% coverage compared to the corresponding sequences of the type strain CBS 151.35 (GU227862, GU227960, GU228156, GU228352, GU228254, and GU228058). Phylogenetic analysis combining all loci revealed that the isolate JL6 and the type strains of C. truncatum clustered in one group (Fig. 2). One-year-old healthy seedlings of T. terrestris (cultivar: landrace) were used for pathogenicity test. Suspension (1×105 conidia/mL) of isolate JL6 was sprayed on ten seedlings, and ten seedlings sprayed with sterilized distilled water were used as the control. Three replicates were performed on each treatment. All plants were kept at 28±1°C (12 h photoperiod), and were evaluated after 7 days. The inoculated plants showed lesions on the leaf surface, similar to those in the field, and the control remained symptomless. The pathogen was successfully reisolated and identified using the methods mentioned above. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. truncatum causing anthracnose on T. terrestris, which will provide valuable information for designing strategies to manage anthracnose on T. terrestris."

      "abstract": "Fructose overconsumption promotes tumor progression. Neuroblastoma is a common extracranial tumor with about 50% 5-year survival rate in high-risk children. The anti-tumor effect of Tribulus terrestris might bring new hope to neuroblastoma therapy. However, whether fructose disturbs the therapeutic effect of T. terrestris is currently unknown. In this study, the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro 2a (N2a) cells, was used to investigate the therapeutic effects of T. terrestris extract at various dosages (0.01, 1, 100 ng/ml) in regular EMEM medium or extra added fructose (20 mM) for 24 h. 100 ng/ml T. terrestris treatment significantly reduced the cell viability, whereas the cell viabilities were enhanced at the dosages of 0.01 or 1 ng/ml T. terrestris in the fructose milieu instead. The inhibition effect of T. terrestris on N2a migration was blunted in the fructose milieu. Moreover, T. terrestris effectively suppressed mitochondrial functions, including oxygen consumption rates, the activities of electron transport enzymes, the expressions of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, and mitochondrial membrane potential. These suppressions were reversed in the fructose group. In addition, the T. terrestris-suppressed mitofusin and the T. terrestris-enhance mitochondrial fission 1 protein were maintained at basal levels in the fructose milieu. Together, these results demonstrated that T. terrestris extract effectively suppressed the survival and migration of neuroblastoma via inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and disturbing mitochondrial dynamics. Whereas, the fructose milieu blunted the therapeutic effect of T. terrestris, particularly, when the dosage is reduced.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Atherosclerosis (AS) is one of major threatens of death worldwide, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation is an important characteristic in the progression of AS. Tribulus terrestris L. is a well-known Chinese Materia Medica for treating skin pruritus, vertigo and cardiovascular diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. However, its anti-AS activity and inhibition effect on VSMC proliferation are not fully elucidated. AIMS: We hypothesize that the furostanol saponins enriched extract (FSEE) of T. terrestris L. presents anti-AS effect by inhibition of VSMC proliferation. The molecular action mechanism underlying the anti-VSMC proliferation effect of FSEE is also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apolipoprotein-E deficient (ApoE-/-) mice and rat thoracic smooth muscle cell A7r5 were employed as the in vivo and in vitro models respectively to evaluate the anti- AS and VSMC proliferation effects of FSEE. In ApoE-/- mice, the amounts of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein in serum were measured by commercially available kits. The size of atherosclerotic plaque was observed by hematoxylin & eosin staining. The protein expressions of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and osteopontin (OPN) in the plaque were examined by immunohistochemistry. In A7r5 cells, the cell viability and proliferation were tested by MTT and Real Time Cell Analysis assays. The cell migration was evaluated by wound healing assay. Propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle progression. The expression of intracellular total and phosphorylated proteins including protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), were detected by western blotting analysis. RESULTS: FSEE significantly reduced the area of atherosclerotic plaque in high-fat diet-fed ApoE-/- mice. And FSEE increased the protein expression level of α-SMA and decreased the level of OPN in atherosclerotic plaque, which revealed the inhibition of VSMC phenotype switching and proliferation. In A7r5 cells, FSEE suppressed fetal bovine serum (FBS) or oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-triggered VSMC proliferation and migration in a concentration dependent manner. FSEE protected against the elevation of cell numbers in S phase induced by FBS or oxLDL and the reduction of cell numbers in G0/G1 phase induced by oxLDL. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Akt and MAPKs including MEK, ERK and JNK could be facilitated by FBS or oxLDL, while co-treatment of FSEE attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt induced by oxLDL as well as the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK induced by FBS. In addition, (25R)-terrestrinin B (JL-6), which was the main ingredient of FSEE, and its potential active pharmaceutical ingredients tigogenin (Tigo) and hecogenin (Heco) also significantly attenuated FBS or oxLDL-induced VSMC proliferation in A7r5 cells. CONCLUSION: FSEE presents potent anti- AS and VSMC proliferation activities and the underlying mechanism is likely to the suppression of Akt/MEK/ERK signaling. The active components of FSEE are JL-6 and its potential active pharmaceutical ingredients Tigo and Heco. So, FSEE and its active compounds may be potential therapeutic drug candidates for AS.",

Here, an analytical strategy by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled ion mobility spectrometry was applied to characterize the main compounds from the fruits of Tribulus terrestris, which significantly boosted the separation efficiency and broadened the capacity of chromatographic column. A total of 155 chemicals including 120 steroidal saponins, 13 flavonoids, 20 alkaloids and 2 ferulic acids were identified or tentatively identified using the propounded method. An α-glucosidase inhibition test was conducted to compare whether the aptness of Tribulus terrestris differed from different origins. The results indicated that the activity of Tribulus terrestris from Inner Mongolia was better than that from Jilin and Hebei. Principal component analysis was next employed to seek out the potential chemical markers among these Tribulus terrestris from three origins. There were 13 substances exist significant differences in content of Tribulus terrestris from the three producing areas. These significant differences involve 11 steroidal saponins and 2 alkaloids. Among them, Inner Mongolia possessed the highest contention of all the 11 saponins. This suggested steroidal saponins may emerge huge potential of α-glucosidase inhibition activity. In conclusion, the present study furnished the identification of chemical components of medical herbs with various isomers as well as disclosed the latent diabetes treatment potential of steroidal saponins in Tribulus terrestris.",

(TT) drug pair in the treatment of hypertension-associated neurovascular lesions and IS via the ferroptosis pathway. METHODS: We used the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform to search for the key active compounds and targets of the drug pair. Based on the GeneCards database, the relevant targets for the drug pair were obtained. Then, we performed the molecular docking of the screened core active ingredients and proteins using the DAVID database and the R AutoDock Vina software. Based on the GSE22255 dataset, these screened target proteins were used to build random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models. Finally, a new IS nomogram prediction model was constructed and evaluated. RESULTS: There were 36 active compounds in the EUO-TT drug pair. CHRM1, NR3C1, ADRB2, and OPRD1 proteins of the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway interacted with the proteins related to the ferroptosis pathway. Molecular docking experiments identified 12 active ingredients of the drug pair that may tightly bind to those target proteins. We constructed a visual IS nomogram prediction model using four genes (CHRM1, NR3C1, ADRB2, and OPRD1). The calibration curve, DCA, and clinical impact curves all indicated that the nomogram model is clinically applicable and diagnostically capable. CHRM1, NR3C1, ADRB2, and OPRD1, the target genes of the four effective components of the EUO-TT drug pair, were considered as risk markers for IS. CONCLUSIONS: The active ingredients of EUO-TT drug pair may act on proteins associated with the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway to regulate ferroptosis in vascular neurons cells, ultimately affecting the onset and progression of hypertension."

Quantitative proteomics sequencing was performed to screen the targets of EU-TT, so as to provide data support for the clinical application of EU-TT. METHODS: Eighteen-month-old SHRs were administered EU-TT (5.53 g/kg/day) intragastrically for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was recorded to evaluate the efficacy of EU-TT in vivo. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining were used to assess the morphology of the hypothalamus. The label free proteomics assay was performed to screen the targets of EU-TT in hypertensive hypothalami. ERK, JNK, and p38 were chosen for Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, EU-TT effectively decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 19.2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 8.6 mmHg (P<0.05), and improved the hypothalamus morphology of aging SHRs. Label free proteomics identified 248 differentially expressed (DE) proteins (157 were upregulated and 91 were downregulated) in the hypothalamus after EU-TT treatment. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis suggested that EU-TT regulated the MAPK signal transduction pathway, which was also confirmed by RT-qPCR and Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: EU-TT steadily decreased the SBP and DBP of aging SHRs, and improved the morphology of the hypothalamus, which was pharmacologically related to the MAPK signaling pathway. KEYWORDS: Aging spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs); Eucommia ulmoides-Tribulus terrestris (EU-TT); hypothalamus; label free proteomics; MAPK signaling pathway."

This paper reviews the provenance, constituents and properties of Tribulus terrestris, L., its general physiological and health effects, as well as the currently available knowledge concerning its influence on male and female reproductive processes and their dysfunctions. Analysis of the available publications demonstrated the influence of Tribulus terrestris on a wide spectrum of targets and physiological processe and disorders. In particular, Tribulus terrestris can be a stimulator of male and female reproductive processes at the level of central nervous system, sexual behaviour, pituitary and gonadal hormones and their receptors, gonadal functions (including ovarian follicullogenesis and spermatogenesis), improvement of the quality and quantity of gametes (at least of sperm) and fecundity. This ability of puncture vine is applicable for the improvement of man's sexual desire and sperm quality in vivo and in vitro, as well as of women's libido, activation of women's reproductive organs, fecundity, and treatment of infertility, especially that related to the polycystic ovarian syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris saponins (TTS) have been longley used as an overall tonic and recent studies showed they influence inflammatory conditions. We examined the ameliorative effect of a commercial formula of a saponin-rich extract of TT in a model of dietary obesity in female rats focusing on their ability to control the inflammatory burden, insulin resistance (IR), adipokine expression and the related reproductive system pathologies. Female rats were fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks to launch diet-induced obesity; they were assigned as: the obese control female rats (OFR) which received no treatment and TTS (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) treated rats; they were compared to a normal rat group. We determined the IR index, serum/tissue inflammatory cytokines, and adipose tissue adipokine expression and examined the secondary ovarian pathologies. Body weight gain, serum triglycerides and IR (>5-fold) in the OFR group were greater than the normal group; TTS lessened these parameters compared with the OFR group. TTS, at 10 mg/kg dose, ameliorated mRNA expression of leptin and visfatin genes in addition to serum inflammatory cytokine levels. Moreover, TTS corrected the hyperprolactinemia and other hormonal disturbances and ameliorated the ovarian pathologies. This study highlighted that the anti-inflammatory properties of TTS helped in alleviation of IR and body weight gain in OFR. Upon correction of obesity manifestations, the gonadal hormone dysregulations and ovarian pathologies were subsequently ameliorated. We can consider TTS as a promising candidate that may alleviate the inflammatory burden, IR and adipokine expression in obesity and hence prevent the secondary gonadal complications in female subjects if appropriate clinical studies are available.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated antiglycation and antioxidant activities of crude dry extract and saponin fraction of Tribulus terrestris. It also developed a method of microencapsulation and evaluated antiglycation and antioxidant activities of crude dry extract and saponin fraction before and after microcapsule release. METHODS: Antiglycation activity was determined by relative electrophoretic mobility (REM), free amino groups and inhibition of advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation. Antioxidant activity was determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), nitric oxide (NO) and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) tests. Microcapsules were prepared using maltodextrin as wall material and freeze-drying as encapsulation technique. Morphological characterization of microcapsules was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, and encapsulation efficiency and microcapsule release were determined by total saponins released. Antiglycation and antioxidant assays were performed using crude dry extract and saponin fraction of T. terrestris before and after release. RESULTS: Saponin fraction showed an increase of 32.8% total saponins. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed the presence of saponins in the obtained fraction. Antiglycation evaluation by REM demonstrated that samples before and after release presented antiglycation activity similar to bovine serum albumin treated with aminoguanidine. Additionally, samples inhibited AGE formation, highlighting treatment with saponin fraction after release (89.89%). Antioxidant tests demonstrated antioxidant activity of the samples. Crude dry extract before encapsulation presented the highest activities in DPPH (92.00%) and TBARS (32.49%) assays. Saponin fraction before encapsulation in FRAP test (499 μmol Trolox equivalent per gram of dry sample) and NO test (15.13 μmol nitrite formed per gram of extract) presented the highest activities. CONCLUSION: This study presented antiglycation activity of crude dry extract and saponin fraction of T. terrestris, besides it demonstrated promising antioxidant properties. It also showed that the encapsulation method was efficient and maintained biological activity of bioactive compounds after microcapsule release. These results provide information for further studies on antidiabetic and antiaging potential, and data for new herbal medicine and food supplement formulations containing microcapsules with crude extract and/or saponin fraction of T. terrestris.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertensive renal injury is one of the most lethal complications of hypertension. At present, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers are considered the best drugs for the treatment of renal injury in hypertension because of their nephroprotective effect of reducing proteinuria, but there are no specific drugs for this purpose, however, clinical trials proved that Chinese medicine has a protective effect on target organs in the treatment of hypertension. Tribulus terrestris L. (TrT), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has potential applications due to its reno-protective and immunomodulatory effects. METHODS: We investigated the underlying reno-protective mechanism of TrT on Angiotensin II (AngII)-induced hypertensive renal injury in glomerular endothelial cells by integrating the differential expression profiles of micro RNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) to construct a miRNA-mRNA interaction network associated with hypertensive kidney injury, followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for validation. RESULTS: Seventy-six differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and 1 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified in the control group and the AngII-induced hypertensive renal injury group, respectively. 110 DEmRNAs and 27 DEmiRNAs were identified in the TrT treatment group and the AngII-induced group, respectively. The core component of the miRNA-mRNA network was miR-155-5p. Our study showed that miR-155-5p expression levels were more decreased in the AngII-induced hypertensive renal injury group than the control group. TrT treatment also significantly upregulated miR-155-5p. Additionally, we found that miR-155-5p expression levels were negatively correlated with H2A clustered histone 6 (H2AC6). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that TrT has a reno-protective effect on AngII-induced hypertensive renal injury by miR-155-5p, which negatively regulates the expression of H2AC6. Our findings offer a new therapeutic strategy and have identified an effective candidate target for the treatment of hypertensive renal injury in clinical settings."

In the adrenaline model of hyperglycemia, aqueous suspensions of cell biomass pre-administered at a dose of 100 mg dry biomass/kg significantly reduced glucose level in animal blood 1-2.5 h (D. deltoidea and T. terrestris) or 1 h (P. japonicus) after adrenaline hydrochloride administration. In a streptozotocin-induced model of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the cell biomass of D. deltoidea and T. terrestris acted towards normalization of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as evidenced by a significant reduction of daily diuresis (by 39-57%), blood-glucose level (by 46-51%), blood content in urine (by 78-80%) and total cholesterol (25-36%) compared to animals without treatment. Bioactive secondary metabolites identified in the cell cultures and potentially responsible for their actions were deltoside, 25(S)-protodioscin and protodioscin in D. deltoidea; furostanol-type steroidal glycosides and quinic acid derivatives in T. terrestris; and ginsenosides and malonyl-ginsenosides in P. japonicus.

With the diverse uses of FT, more attention has been paid to its hepatorenal toxicity. However, the compounds causing the hepatorenal toxicity of FT remain undetermined. Terrestrosin D (TED), a major spirostanol saponin isolated from FT, may exert hepatorenal toxicity. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the potential hepatorenal toxicity of TED, and preliminarily explore the possible mechanism of TED-induced hepatorenal toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity assays, a repeated-dose 28-day in-vivo study, a toxicokinetic study, and a tissue distribution study were used to evaluate the potential hepatorenal toxicity of TED. Furthermore, network pharmacology was applied to preliminarily explore the possible mechanism of TED-induced hepatorenal toxicity. RESULTS: Both the in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the spirostanol saponin TED had potential hepatorenal toxicity. Nonetheless, hepatorenal toxicity induced by oral treatment with TED at a dosage range of 5 - 15 mg/kg daily for 28 consecutive days to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was reversible after 14 days of TED withdrawal. The toxicokinetic study demonstrated that the systematic exposure of SD rats to TED had an accumulation phenomenon and a dose-dependent trend after a 28-day repeated-dose oral administration. The tissue distribution study revealed that TED had a targeted distribution in the liver and kidneys accompanied by a phenomenon of accumulation in SD rats. Network pharmacology combined with molecular docking methods was used to screen for the key targets (HSP90AA1, CNR1, and DRD2) and the key pathways of TED-induced hepatorenal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The spirostanol saponin TED, a major spirostanol saponin isolated from FT, had potential hepatorenal toxicity.",

Even though many reports are available elucidating the anticancer potential of the herb, we, for the very first time have attempted to isolate and identified the active compound present in seed crude saponin extract and confers its in silico docking ability with various cellular targets proteins. High performance thin layer chromatography confirms the presence of active saponins in leaf and seed saponin extracts which were further fractionated by silica gel column chromatography. Fractions collected were assessed for cytotoxicity on human breast cancer cells. High resolution liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy was employ to identify the active components present in fraction with highest cytotoxicity. Intriguingly, Nautigenin type of steriodal saponin was identified to present in the active fraction of seed extract (SF11) and the identified compound was further analyzed for its in silico docking interaction using PyRx AutodockVina. Docking studies revealed the high binding affinity of Nuatigenin at significant sites with apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8, p53 and apoptosis inducing factor along with cell surface receptors estrogen receptor, projesterone receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2. Thus, the conclusions were drawn that saponin fraction of Tribulus terrestis possesses active compounds having anticancer property and specifically, Nuatigenin saponin can be considered as an important therapeutic drug for the breast cancer treatment.",

A total of 104 women were randomly assigned to receive 94mg, three times/day (TT3) or 280mg once/day for 90 days (TT1). Evaluation was performed using FSFI and QS-F questionnaires, serum levels of prolactin, TSH, total testosterone and SHBG, and clitoral artery assessment with Power Doppler ultrasound. FSFI results demonstrated an improvement in all domains in both groups (P < 0.05) except for the \"Satisfaction\" in the TT3 premenopausal group. QS-F results showed a significant improvement in the mean total score in women of both reproductive phases, for both groups. Postmenopausal patients improved in all sexual domains, except for \"orgasm\" in the TT1 group. PI of the clitoral artery showed no difference in both reproductive phases, in both groups. We conclude that TTerrestris can be a safe alternative for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in pre and postmenopausal women as it is effective in reducing the symptoms with no side effects. Moreover, its use, increased total, free and bioavailable testosterone.",

Diabetic rats were divided into three groups: diabetic control group, TT extract with low protodioscin content group (TT-LPC) and TT extract with high protodioscin content group (TT-HPC). After twelve weeks of treatment, fasting blood glucose, insulin, LH, FSH and testosterone levels were measured. Both TT preparations reduced elevated blood glucose level. Insulin and luteinizing hormone levels were not significantly different compared with the control group; however, the FSH and testosterone levels were significantly higher in the TT-HPC group compared with the diabetic control group. The testosterone level is correlated in part with the protodioscin concentration in extracts and is probably mediated through an FSH-linked pathway."

It conveys potentially many deleterious consequences such as high risk of progression to hypertension and cardiovascular disease later in life. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to evaluate the blood pressure-lowering effect of Khār-i-khasak (Tribulus terrestris Linn.) in prehypertensive individuals. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was conducted at the National Institute of Unani Medicine, Hospital, Bengaluru, after approval by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Prehypertensive individuals over 18 years of age were enrolled after obtaining their written informed consent and were randomly allocated to the test or placebo group. The test and placebo groups were administered powdered dried fruits of Khār-i-khasak (6g) and matched placebo (6g) in three divided doses for two months respectively. The efficacy assessment was determined by changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. RESULTS: Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed a significant decline in the test group (p<0.001) as compared to the placebo group. The average decline in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was -7.7/5.5 mmHg in the test group and -1.9/0.2 mmHg in the placebo group. During the post-therapy follow-up period, no prehypertensive developed full-blown hypertension in either group. Safety parameters were found to be within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: The test drug Khār-i-khasak (T. terrestris Linn.) was found to be effective and safe in lowering blood pressure compared to placebo in prehypertensive individuals.",

Their therapeutic effect is due to the presence in them, of a variety of natural compounds and biologically important trace elements, especially in higher concentrations present in higher doses. T. terrestris is becoming more and more popular for the treatment of diseases of the human genital area and sexual dysfunctions. The elemental content in the tissues of leaf, flower, and fruit of T. terrestris was determined by using multi-element instrumental epithermal neutron activation analysis. For the first time, 26 essential and trace elements were observed in the plant species collected in Russia (from cultivated) and China (wild growing). It was confirmed that the elemental composition of T. terrestris grass varies depending on the habitat (geographic zones). The place of growth affects the accumulation of elements by the plant."

This study attempted to investigate the role played by the intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolism in the response of elderly spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) to ET administration as a treatment for hypertension. Fourteen male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, 18 months old) were randomly divided into an ET group and an SHR group, and 7 Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats of the same age were employed as the control group. The ET group was intragastrically administered 1.0 g/kg/d ET for 42 days, and SHRs and WKY rats were administered an equal amount of normal saline intragastrically. The intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolism were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing and the GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)/MS assay. ET treatment decreased blood pressure steadily, improved the colonic tissue morphology, and changed the structure and composition of the imbalanced microbiota in SHRs. Specifically, ET treatment increased the abundance of Eubacterium, which might be one of the target microbes for ET, and had a negative correlation with the levels of α-tocopherol, chenodeoxycholic acid, and deoxycholic acid according to the Spearman correlation analysis. The change in the intestinal microbiota affected the fecal metabolic pattern of SHRs. Eight potential biomarkers were determined to be primarily enriched in ABC transporters, phenylalanine metabolism, central carbon metabolism in cancer, purine metabolism, and protein digestion and absorption. The correlation analysis demonstrated that the abundance of Eubacterium and the decreased levels of α-tocopherol, chenodeoxycholic acid, and deoxycholic acid in the ET group were highly correlated. Our results suggest that ET has a good antihypertensive effect, which may be driven by the intestinal microbiota and their beneficial metabolites. The results of this study may help to elucidate the antihypertensive mechanism of ET.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris (T.T.) is a rich source of flavonoids and saponins, which have been reported to have neuroprotective and antioxidant potential. The current study was planned to investigate the anti-Parkinson's activity of T. terrestris methanol extract (TTME). It was hypothesized that TTME possessed antioxidant potential and can ameliorate Parkinson's disease (PD) via modulation of α-synuclein, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), TNF-α, and IL-1β. To test this hypothesis, in silico and in vivo studies were performed. The PD model in rats was prepared by giving haloperidol, 1 mg/kg, i.p. Rats were divided into six groups: control, disease control, standard, and treatment groups receiving TTME orally at 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg dose levels for 21 days. Behavioral observations and biochemical analyses were done. The TTME modulatory effect on mRNA expression of α-synuclein, AChE, TNF-α, and interleukins in the brain homogenate was estimated by RT-PCR. Compounds detected in HPLC analysis disrupted the catalytic triad of AChE in in silico studies. Behavioral observations showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in a reversal of catatonia, muscular strength, locomotor functions, stride length, and exploration in a dose-dependent manner (1000 >300 >100 mg/kg) of PD rats. Endogenous antioxidant enzyme levels CAT, SOD, GSH, and GPx were significantly restored at a high dose (p < 0.05) with a notable (p < 0.05) decrease in the MDA level in TTME-treated groups. TTME at a high dose significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the level of acetylcholinesterase. RT-PCR results are showing down-regulation in the mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, α -synuclein, TNF-α, and AChE in TTME-treated groups compared to the disease control group, indicating neuroprotection. It is concluded that TTME has potential to ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease."

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease in which intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin (SELE) are consistently expressed in the vascular endothelium. Several evidence support the crucial role of adhesion molecules in the development of atherosclerosis and plaque instability. Due to the anti-inflammatory activity of Tribulus terrestris (TT), the present study investigated the effect of aqueous extract and saponin fraction of TT on the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE genes in endothelial cells during normal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced conditions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMEC) were cultured, stimulated by LPS, and treated with aqueous extract and saponin fraction of TT. Finally, the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE genes were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. LPS-induced HUVECs and HBMECs significantly increased the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE in comparison with control groups (P<0.001). Treatment of LPS-induced HUVECs and HBMECs by aqueous extract and saponin fraction of TT decreased the expression of all three mentioned genes significantly (P<0.001) in comparison with LPS-induced cells. Taken together, our data suggest that TT has an anti-inﬂammatory effect. In vivo study about anti-inﬂammatory effect of this herb may provide new insights into the development of a herbal drug for the prevention/therapy of atherosclerosis."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells has been confirmed to play a crucial role in the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or other retinal degenerative diseases. Tribulus terrestris (TT) is a Chinese traditional herb medicine, which has been used for the treatment of ocular diseases for many centuries. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of TT and examined its ability to protect and restore the human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Our data show that 200 μg/mL of ethanol extract of Tribulus terrestris (EE-TT) significantly increased the cell viability and prevented the apoptosis of H2O2-treated ARPE-19 cells through the regulation of Bcl2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and caspase-9. Treatment with EE-TT also significantly decreased the upregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) activities and increased the downregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities induced by H2O2 in ARPE-19 cells. Additionally, H2O2 at 1 mM significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of Nrf2, CAT, SOD1, SOD2, HO-1, GST-pi, NQO1, and GLCM in ARPE-19 cells; however, treatment with EE-TT reversed the downregulated mRNA expression levels of all these genes induced by H2O2. Furthermore, treatment with 200 μg/mL EE-TT alone for 24 h significantly increased Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM mRNA expressions in ARPE-19 cells when compared with untreated control cells. Pretreatment with the inhibitor of PI3K/Akt signaling (LY294002) completely blocked these EE-TT-upregulated mRNA expressions and abolished the improvement of cell viability in H2O2-treated ARPE-19 cells. These findings all suggest that Tribulus terrestris has significant antioxidant effects on oxidative stressed ARPE-19 cells through regulating PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

Gross saponins of Tribulus terrestris L. fruit (GSTTF) has an obvious neuroprotective effect on the treatment of ischemic stroke, but its potential therapeutic mechanisms have not been thoroughly studied. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the protective effect of GSTTF against ischemic stroke in rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The combination of metabolomics and network pharmacology analysis was applied to investigate the protective effects of GSTTF on ischemic stroke and its putative mechanism. The related pathway of the biomarkers highlighted from metabolomics analysis was explored, then the possible targets of GSTTF were further revealed by network pharmacology analysis. Molecular docking was conducted to investigate the interaction between the active compound and target protein. RESULTS: Metabolomics analysis showed that metabolic disturbances were observed in serum for the rats in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). These MCAO-induced deviations in serum metabolism can be reversely changed by GSTTF via metabolic pathways regulation. Twenty-four proteins with the connectivity degree larger than 15 were selected by the network pharmacology analysis, which are considered as the possible therapeutic targets of the GSTTF against ischemic stroke. The results of molecular docking showed that the active compounds were capable of binding to the representative potential targets HSD11B1 and AR, respectively. And the docking mode of two compounds with the lowest binding energy to their target protein was illustrated by the ribbon binding map. CONCLUSION: The present study combines metabolomics and network pharmacology analysis to investigate the mechanism of MCAO-induced ischemic stroke and reveal the efficiency and possible mechanisms of GSTTF for ischemic stroke. Further studies on the bioactive saponin as well as their synergistic action on ischemic stroke will be conducted to better reveal the underlying mechanisms.",

SELECTION OF STUDIES:  We included any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared T. terrestris versus inactive/active interventions. After the selection process, conducted by two reviewers, 5 RCTs (n = 279 participants) were included. DATA COLLECTION:  Data extraction was performed by two reviewers with a preestablished data collection formulary. DATA SYNTHESIS:  Due to lack of data and clinical heterogeneity, we could not perform meta-analyses. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, and the certainty of evidence was assessed with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). RESULTS:  After 1 to 3 months of treatment, premenopausal and postmenopausal women randomized to T. terrestris had a significant increase in sexual function scores. Three months of treatment with T. terrestris showed a significant increase in the serum testosterone levels of premenopausal women. There was no report of serious adverse events, and none of the studies assessed health-related quality of life. The certainty of the evidence was very low, which means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimates, and future studies are likely to change these estimates. CONCLUSION:  More RCTs are needed to support or refute the use of T. terrestris. The decision to use this intervention should be shared with the patients, and the uncertainties around its effects should be discussed in the clinical decision-making process.Number of Protocol registration in PROSPERO database: CRD42019121130.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammation that interferes with blood arteries functions due to the accumulation of low density lipids and cholesterol. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of aqueous extract and saponin fraction of Tribulus terrestris L. (TT) on the proteome and expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and human bone marrow endothelial cell (HBMEC) lines. METHODS: Two cell lines were cultured and induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The primed cells were then treated with aqueous extract and saponin fraction of TT. The protein profile of the endothelial cells was assessed under normal and LPS-induced conditions using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 2D gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin were estimated by use of western blotting. RESULTS: LPS-induced HUVECs and HBMECs were shown to significantly increase the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin in comparison to control groups. Our findings revealed that TT extract resulted in significantly more reduced levels of proteome (80 spots) as well as all the three mentioned proteins compared with the effect of saponin fraction alone. CONCLUSION: TT extract and its saponin fraction exerted anti-inflammatory effects on HUVEC and HBMEC lines and reduced the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of aqueous extract was greater than that of saponin fraction. Therefore, TT could be considered as a potential candidate for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Modern treatment interventions for kidney stones are wrought with side-effects, hence the need for alternative therapies such as plant-based medicines. We have previously documented through in vitro studies that statistically optimized aqueous extract of Tribulus terrestris (Zygophyllaceae family) possesses antiurolithic and antioxidant potential. This provides strong scientific foundation to conduct in vivo efficacy and preclinical safety studies to corroborate and lend further proof to its ability to prevent and cure kidney stones. The preventive and curative urolithiatic efficacy in experimentally induced nephrolithiatic Wistar rats, along with preclinical toxicity was evaluated following oral administration of statistically optimized aqueous extract of T. terrestris. Treatment showed augmented renal function, restoration of normal renal architecture and increase in body weight. Microscopic analysis of urine revealed excretion of small sized urinary crystals, demonstrating that treatment potentially modulated the morphology of renal stones. Tissue enzymatic estimation affirmed the antioxidant efficacy of treatment with reduced free radical generation. Significant upregulation of p38MAPK at both the gene and protein level was noted in hyperoxaluric group and interestingly treatment reversed it. Acute oral toxicity study established the Median Lethal Dose (LD50) to be greater than 2000 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.) No observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) by repeated oral toxicity for 28 days at 750 mg/kg b.wt. was noted. This study lends scientific evidence to the safe, preventive and curative potential of statistically optimized aqueous extract of T. terrestris at a dose of 750 mg/kg b.wt. and suggests that the extract shows promise as a therapeutic antiurolithic agent.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Gross saponins of Tribulus terrestris fruit (GSTTF) has been used for neuroprotective therapy on convalescents of ischemic stroke. But the related therapeutic mechanisms have not yet been well investigated. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of GSTTF on ischemic stroke using metabolomics coupled with network pharmacology analysis. The rat urine sample was collected and profiled by an LC-MS-based metabolomics approach. The pathway analysis was performed based on the highlighted biomarkers, then the network pharmacology approach was applied to screen the potential therapeutic targets of GSTTF. Metabolomics analysis showed that a series of metabolic perturbations occurred in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group compared with the sham group. Gross saponins of Tribulus terrestris fruit can change the MCAO-induced urine metabolic deviations in a reverse manner via regulating multiple metabolic pathways. Two proteins, inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B), were highlighted by the network pharmacology analysis, which may be the potential therapeutic targets for the GSTTF against ischemic stroke. This study provides an overview of the mechanism of MCAO-induced ischemic stroke and investigates the efficacy of GSTTF in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Further study is needed to reveal its underlying mechanisms more clearly."

In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of AP and TT extracts both separately and simultaneously on the male Wistar rat fertility parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: Control, TT, AP, and AT treated groups. Treatment continued for 25 days and rats were weighed daily. Their testes were dissected for histological studies. Sperm analysis including sperm count, viability and motility were performed. Serum was obtained to evaluate testosterone, LH and FSH levels. Histological studies were conducted to study Leydig, and Sertoli cells, spermatogonia and spermatid cell numbers, and to measure seminiferous diameter and epithelium thickness. RESULTS: Sperm count increased in all the treatment groups. Sperm viability and motility in AT and AP groups were elevated. TT and AT groups showed signifi cantly increased testosterone level compared to control group (P=004, P=0.000, respectively) and TT, AP and AT treatment groups showed increased LH level (P=0.002, P=0.03 and P=0.000, respectively) compared to control, while only AT group showed increased FSH (p=0.006) compared to control. Histological studies showed signifi cant increase of spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cell numbers and epithelial thickness in AT group compared to other groups. All the treatment groups had higher number of Leydig, spermatogonia and spermatid cells. CONCLUSION: TT and AP improved sexual parameters; however, their simultaneous administration had higher improving effects on studied parameters.",

However, its effects on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary inflammation and the subsequent fibrotic changes remain unclear. Objective: To examine the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of TED against BLM in murine pulmonary tissues. Materials and methods: Male SPF mice received saline (control), TED (10 mg/kg), BLM (2.5 mg/kg), or BLM (2.5 mg/kg) + TED (10 mg/kg) group. BLM was administered as a single intranasal inoculation, and TED was intraperitoneally administered once daily. After 2 and 6 weeks of treatment, cell number and differentiation (Giemsa staining) and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1, and PDGF-AB levels (ELISA) were determined in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in the left pulmonary tissue was also determined (ELISA). The right pulmonary tissue was H&E-stained and assessed for the severity of pulmonary fibrosis using the Ashcroft scoring method. Compared with the BLM group, TED decreased inflammatory cell infiltration; number of macrophages (p < 0.05), neutrophils (p < 0.05), lymphocytes (p < 0.05); percentage of macrophages in the monocyte-macrophage system (p < 0.05), and levels of TNF-α (p < 0.01), IL-6 (p < 0.01), IL-8 (p < 0.05), TGF-β1 (p < 0.05), and PDGF-AB (p < 0.05) in the BALF. TED also reduced Hyp content (p < 0.05) in the pulmonary tissue and attenuated the BLM-induced deterioration in lung histopathology. Discussion and conclusions: TED can inhibit BLM-induced inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs of mice, which may be related to reduced inflammatory and fibrotic markers. These results could be further tested in humans through clinical studies.",

METHODS: The T2DMED model was constructed by high-fat and high-sugar feeding and streptozotocin injection. After 4 weeks of GSTT intervention. Intracavernous pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured in each group. The level of nitric oxide (NO) in the cavernous tissue was detected using the nitrate reductase method. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using DHE fluorescent probe detection. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cGMP) level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was detected using immunohistochemistry. Masson staining was used to detect the cavernosal smooth muscle/collagen ratio. Apoptosis in endothelial cells was measured using TUNEL. Western blotting method to detect the protein expression level of eNOS, TIMP-1, cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved caspase 9. RESULTS: After treatment, the ICP and ICP/MAP values of the GSTT were significantly higher than those of the T2DMED group (P<0.05). Unlike the T2DMED group, the GSTT group showed significantly increased NO levels (P<0.05) and decreased ROS levels (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the GSTT group and the sildenafil group in increasing cGMP levels (P>0.05), and the mixed group had higher levels than these two groups (P<0.05). Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed that the expression of eNOS in the GSTT was significantly higher than that in the T2DMED groups (P<0.05). Masson staining showed that the smooth muscle/collagen ratio of the GSTT group was significantly higher than that of the T2DMED groups (P<0.05), the expression of TIMP-1 was lower than that of T2DMED group (P<0.05). TUNEL assay showed that the apoptotic index and cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 expression level of GSTT group were lower than that of the T2DMED group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: GSTT can protect T2DMED rats' erectile function by improving penile endothelial function and inhibiting cavernosum fibrosis, inhibiting apoptosis, and is synergistic with sildenafil."

Tribulus terrestris (TT) has good anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Hydroalcoholic extract of different dose of TT was evaluated against mercuric chloride-induced nephrotoxicity. Rats (n = 6) were treated with TT at doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg. Drugs were administered orally for 7 days. Single dose of mercuric chloride (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) on the 5th day caused significant elevation of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, malondialdehyde, liver fatty acid binding protein, kidney injury molecule-1, and kidney mercury level and fall in glutathione, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and histopathological changes in disease control as compared to normal control group (P < 0.001). Dose of TT 200 and 300 mg/kg significantly (P < 0.001) prevented the renal injury, and mercury accumulation in kidney tissues significantly decreases in higher dose, i.e., 300 mg/kg as compared to control group. Our result indicates that the treatment of TT exerted significant protection against renal damage induced by mercuric chloride possibly due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and by decreasing the renal accumulation of mercury."

      "abstract": "Strong evidence proposes that brain oxidative DNA damage and microglia activation contribute to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Traditional therapeutic regimens for PD can only relieve the symptoms. Tribulus terrestris (T. terrestris), a flowering plant from family Zygophyllaceae, is used in traditional medicine for treating different disorders and exerts neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in experimental models. The current study attempted to test whether treatment with T. terrestris standardized extract (TTE) can improve motor dysfunction and alleviate rotenone induced oxidative DNA damage and neurotoxicity in mice. Six groups of male Swiss albino mice were utilized. Group (1) was the vehicle (oil) group, group 2 was the rotenone control group (1 mg/kg/48 hours, subcutaneously) for 9 times, groups 3 and 4 were injected with rotenone and treated with TTE (5 or 10 mg per kg, by oral gavage) for 17 days, groups 5 and 6 served as TTE (5 or 10 mg per kg) per se groups. Motor function was measured by the pole and the open-field tests. Then, mouse brains were dissected, one hemisphere was employed for biochemical assays and the other one was used in histopathological studies. Results demonstrated that TTE ameliorated the motor dysfunctions induced by rotenone as well as markers of inflammation and DNA damage (8-OHdG and MTH1 expression). Indicators of oxidative stress and upregulation of the microglia marker (CD11b) were suppressed by the higher dose of TTE (10 mg per kg). Finally, the higher dose of TTE improved the Cresyl violet staining and tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining in the substantia nigra. In summary, TTE ameliorated the locomotor dysfunction and dampened the DNA damage and oxidoinflammatory stress in rotenone-parkinsonian mice. These results suggest TTE as a potential candidate for neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease that is characterized by impairments in bone strength that predispose an individual to a higher risk of fractures. Despite the various etiologies, undoubtedly the most important factors are aging of the population and hypogonadism. Although several therapeutic options are available, pharmacological treatments have some risks. Among these are increases in the incidence of thrombosis, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and muscle injury, among others. Herbal medication may be an alternative for the treatment of osteoporosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a standardized extract of Tribulus terrestris L. (TT) on ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in rats. Female rats were first subjected to OVX and treated with TT (3, 30, and 300 mg/[kg·day]) or furosemide (25 mg/kg) orally for 28 days. Bone densitometry and tibial histology were performed, and acute renal function and testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and estradiol levels were assessed. Prolonged treatment with TT stimulated bone mass gain in all ovariectomized animals, raising bone mass to levels that were similar to sham-operated rats. DHEA levels significantly increased in TT-treated rats. The TT group also had lower calcium (Ca2+) excretion that OVX control and furosemide-treated rats. Finally, the histopathological analyses showed the maintenance of bone turnover in all TT-treated groups. Overall, the results indicate that the standardized extract of T. terrestris exerted a bone-protective effect by increasing bone mineral density. This activity may be at least partially attributable to an increase in serum DHEA levels and a Ca2+-sparing effect.",

      "abstract": "The present study has been aimed to explore the different secondary messengers of the inflammatory pathway NF-κB, kinases (JNK, P38MAPK, GSK3β/βcatenin), apoptosis pathway (Caspase-3 and AIF), and neuronal survival pathway (BDNF) in order to understand the neuroprotective mechanism of aqueous extract of Tribulus terrestris (AQTT). In primary cortical neurons, the ischemic condition was induced through oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Anti-inflammatory activity of AQTT was evaluated in formalin induced inflammation model and carrageenan-induced paw edema test. The bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model was employed for whole animal studies. Treatment of AQTT (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced the inflammation induced by formalin and carrageenan. The neuroprotective mechanism of AQTT (50 and 100 mg/kg) was assessed by pre- and post-administration. The results indicate down regulation of kinases and NFkB, suggesting possible anti-inflammatory activity of AQTT. Additionally, AQTT down regulated both caspase dependent and independent apoptotic pathways suggesting its possible anti-apoptotic activity. The treatment of AQTT also reduced GSK3β levels and increased p-Ser9 GSK3β levels; stabilizing the unphosphorylated form of β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus suggesting role of AQTT in neuronal survival and GSK3β mediated anti-inflammatory property. In comparison to pretreatment, post treatment of AQTT had lesser effects indicating tribulusterine standardized AQTT may have prophylactic effect. This study can be concluded with the thesis that AQTT has neuroprotective effect through alternating neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and promoting neuron survival. Being that it produced better effect with pretreatment, exploring this with thrombolytic drugs will be beneficial. For the first time AQTT has been reported for this indication.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is one of the most common neurological disorders and seriously threatens human life. Gross saponins of Tribulus terrestris fruit (GSTTF) are used for neuroprotective treatment on convalescents of ischemic stroke. However, the therapeutic effects and mechanisms have not yet well understood, especially from the metabolic perspective. In this study, the protective effect of GSTTF on ischemic stroke in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was investigated by the GC-MS-based metabolomics approach. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of brain tissues showed that GSTTF significantly reduced the infarct area after MCAO surgery. Metabolomic profiling showed a series of metabolic perturbation occurs in ischemic stroke compared with sham group. GSTTF can reverse the MCAO-induced serum metabolic deviations by regulating multiple metabolic pathways including fatty acids metabolism, amino acids metabolism, and carbohydrates metabolism. The current study provided a useful approach for understanding the mechanism of MCAO-induced ischemic stroke and a reliable basis for evaluating the efficacy of GSTTF in the treatment of ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris (TT), a herb belonging to Zygophyllaceae family is widely used due to its medicinal properties. This study was undertaken to elucidate the anticancer mechanism of TT on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Cytotoxic effect of the herb was assessed by 3-(4,5-diethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptotic potential was assessed through DNA fragmentation, TUNEL and caspase 3 activity assays. Expressions of genes regulating the apoptotic pathway were examined by RT-PCR and expression of proteins was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. The result of MTT assay revealed that methanolic and saponin extracts from leaves and seeds of TT were cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells. Cytotoxicity studies on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proved that TT extracts were non-toxic to non-malignant cells. Treatment of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with seed and leaf methanol and saponin extracts of TT resulted in fragmentation of DNA and induction of apoptosis. This was evident by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA and TUNNEL assay. The extracts of TT also caused a significant increase in caspase 3 activity in MCF-7 cells. TT extracts caused an induction of intrinsic apoptotic pathway which was evident by the upregulation in the expression of Bax and p53 genes and downregulation in the expression of Bcl-2. FADD, AIF and caspase 8 genes were also upregulated indicating the possible induction of extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Therefore, our results suggest that the Tribulus terrestris (TT) extracts may exert their anticancer activity by both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways."

This systematic review collected the clinical trials and/or quasi-experimental studies on the effect of T. terrestris on sperm parameters in idiopathic male infertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To search the related articles, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ProQuest, Clinicaltrial.gov, WHO, Google Scholar, MEDLINE via Pubmed, Web of Science, SID, Magiran, Irandoc, and Iranmedex databases were used without any time limitation. Words used to search were T. terrestris L., Tribestan, male infertility and sperm parameters based on the MeSH glossary. To assess the eligibility of the articles, the views of the two authors and in cases where there was no agreement, the third person was used. RESULTS: Through searching of the databases, 5775 articles were identified, of which 3509 were entered after removing the duplicates. Afterward, 102 articles were screened for inclusion. Finally, 7 articles were included in this systematic review. Only one quasi-experimental without control arm article reported that the use of T. terrestris L. in the treatment of idiopathic male infertility was not effective, In the others, T. terrestris L. was reported to be effective in improving some or all parameters of the sperm, namely number, motility and morphology. CONCLUSION: The results of the present systematic review showed that the consumption of T terrestris L., in general, resulted in the improvement of sperm parameters. This result was obtained from 6 out of the 7 articles.",

After the treatment of the lymphocytes with four concentrations of the aqueous fruit extract of T. terrestris (10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/L) for 24 h it was noticed that, the presence of micronuclei and/or chromosomal aberration were monitored and a significant increase of comet cells at high concentration of T. terrestris extract 80 mg/L. Also, this study showed that the presence of micronuclei, chromosomal aberration as a chromosomal gap, fragmentation, stickiness and necrotic cells were appeared and increased with high concentrations of T. terrestris fruits extract (40-80 mg/L). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed with the low concentration of the extract (10-20 mg/L) as compared with control. The current study refers to the ability of the extract of T. terrestris fruits to do damage in the target DNA at the higher concentrations. Thus, it could be considered that the aqueous extracts of the T. terrestris fruits have genotoxic effect in the therapeutic protocols if it used in high doses."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Increasing life expectancy in women and having menstrual problems and hormone-associated complications have led people to use complementary and alternative medicine. In menopause, the reduction in estrogen and androgen physiologically leads to a decrease in blood flow in the volvuleous and vaginal zone, resulting in a reduction in sexual desire and arousal. Sexual satisfaction plays an important role in mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Tribulus terrestris on sexual satisfaction in postmenopausal women. METHODS: This double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 2017 with the aim of investigating the effect of hydro-alcohol extract of T. terrestris on sexual satisfaction of postmenopausal women on 60 women referred to health center number 1 in eastern Ahvaz. A total of 60 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned into two groups of 30 to receive a syrup containing T. terrestris extract at a concentration of 0.9 mg and placebo for 8 weeks. Sexual satisfaction was calculated based on Larsson questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 22) and t-test was used for comparing two groups in quantitative variables and Chi-square test was used for qualitative variables. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS: After intervention, the mean of sexual satisfaction in the intervention group was significantly higher than in the preintervention group (P < 0.005), and a significant increase in sexual satisfaction was observed in the tetanus syrup group. RESULTS: Taking T. terrestris syrup increased sexual satisfaction in postmenopausal women."

      "abstract": "Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) transplantation has shown great promise for treating various diseases; however, poor viability of transplanted ASCs because of oxidative stress has limited its therapeutic efficiency. Plant saponins are recently been reported to have antioxidant activity tested in various cancer cell lines. This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of Tribulus terrestris saponins (TTS) on the proliferation of ASCs. The cytotoxic activity of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) was determined by treating ASCs with 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 µM H2 O2 for 2 hours. ASCs were treated with 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL concentrations of TTS for the proliferative experiment. To check the protective effect of TTS, experiments were designed in two ways. In one set, ASCs were pretreated with different concentrations of TTS for 2 hours and then apoptosis was induced by treating them with 400 µM H2 O2 for next 2 hours, while in other set, ASCs were first treated with 400 µM H2 O2 for 2 hours and subsequently with different concentrations of TTS for 24 hours. The vitality and proliferation potential of cells were detected by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The result of the current study shows that in response to stress-induced by H2 O2 at concentration of 400 µM, ASCs underwent growth arrest and cell viability was reduced to half while treatment with TTS before and after H2 O2 exposure significantly prevents premature apoptosis. The findings suggest that saponins may act as an effective protective agent against oxidative stress-induced ASCs apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Aging is associated with a series of morphological and functional modifications that leads to reduced physiological efficiency and atrophy of various organs and systems. Tribulus terrestris induces its effect in fertility and sexual functions through the steroidal saponins, particularly the dominant saponins protodioscin. We aimed in this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of Tribulus terrestris in aging males with partial androgen deficiency who suffered from erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms. A total of 70 randomized aging patients with erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms were recruited from June 2017 to March 2018 from our andrology outpatient clinic. Thirty-five patients (group A) received Tribulus terrestris three times daily for 3 months and the other 35 patients (group B) received placebo. The mean of aspartate transaminase was elevated in group A after 3 months of receiving Tribulus terrestris (26.5 (before), 27.8 (after), respectively, p = 0.03). Moreover, there were significant elevations in the means of both total testosterone together with the score of the validated Arabic index of erectile function (5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function) (2.2, 10.7 (before), 2.7, 16.1 (after), p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Finally, the mean of the total prostate-specific antigen was elevated in this group (1.4 (before), 1.7 (before), p = 0.007, respectively). Interestingly, there were no worsening of the lower urinary tract symptoms in group A as there was no change in the mean score of the international prostate symptom score, which was used to assess these symptoms before and after treatment (mean 14.4 (before), 14.6 (after), p = 0.67, respectively). In sum, this study replicates the findings of previous reports about the robust effect of this herbal medicine in elevating the testosterone level and improving the sexual function of patients who suffered from erectile dysfunction with partial androgen deficiency.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris (TT) has been considered as a potential stimulator of testosterone production, which has been related with steroidal saponins prevailing in this plant. Cyclophosphamide (CP) is the most commonly used anticancer and immunosuppressant drug, which causes several toxic effects, especially on the reproductive system. Patients who need to use CP therapy exhibit reduced fertility or infertility, which impacts both physically and emotionally on the decision to use this drug, especially among young men. We hypothesized that the treatment with TT dry extract would protect the male reproductive system against CP toxicity. Mice received dry extract of TT (11 mg/kg) or vehicle by gavage for 14 days. Saline or CP was injected intraperitoneally at a single dose (100 mg/kg) on the 14th day. Animals were euthanized 24 h after CP administration, and testes and epididymis were removed for biochemical and histopathological analysis and sperm evaluation. The dry extract of TT was evaluated by HPLC analysis and demonstrated the presence of protodioscin (1.48%, w/w). CP exposure increased lipid peroxidation, reactive species, and protein carbonylation and altered antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and GR). Moreover, acute exposure to CP caused a reduction on 17 β-HSD activity, which may be related to the reduction in serum testosterone levels, histopathological changes observed in the testes, and the quality of the semen. The present study highlighted the role of TT dry extract to ameliorate the alterations induced by CP administration in mice testes, probably due to the presence of protodioscin.",

      "abstract": "The present study demonstrates apoptosis-inducing potential and mechanism of action of Tribulus terristris alkaloid extract in Jurkat E6-1 cancer cell line. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and High Resolution-Mass Spectrometry analysis identified the presence of four N-feruloyltyramine derivatives, namely trans-N-feruloyl-3-hydroxytyramine (1), trans-N-coumaroyltyramine (2), trans-N-feruloyltyramine (3) and trans-N-feruloyl-3-ethoxytyramine (4) in the alkaloid extract. Compounds 2 and 3 have not been yet reported in the alkaloid extract of T. terristris. In silico analysis revealed therapeutic potential of N-feruloyltyramine derivatives and strong binding efficiency to both chains of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1. Treatment of alkaloids extract to Jurkat E6-1 clone induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity (LC50 140.4 μg mL-1). Jurkat cells treated with alkaloids extract at sub-lethal concentration showed DNA fragmentation, enhancement in caspase-3 activity and phosphatidylserine translocation (apoptosis indicator) compared to control cells. Gene expression analysis using Human Apoptosis RT2 Profiler PCR Array analysis upon alkaloid treatment was found to significantly alter expression of critical genes such as TNFR1, FADD, AIFM, CASP8, TP53, DFFA and NFKB1. These genes are predicted to mediate apoptotic cell death via both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathway. In summary, we report the identification of new N-feruloyltyramine derivatives from alkaloid extract of T. terristris fruit with probable anti-leukemic and pharmacological potential."

Mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were assessed by Randall-Sellitto and electronic von Frey tests, respectively. Chemical- induced nociception was assessed by formalin test. Neurophysiological effect of the extract was evaluated by recording sciatic functional index (SFI) on the test days (7, 10, 14, and 21) and sciatic nerve conduction velocity test (SNCV) on the last day. Inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in both sciatic nerve and brain and brain neurotransmitters, glutamate and aspartate, were measured to support the behavioral response. The saponins of TT-treated group were found to be effective in the behavioral experiments, implying its activity both centrally and peripherally in attenuating pain. The inflammatory mediators in both sciatic nerve and brain (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were found to be attenuated with TT saponin treatment in comparison to vincristine-treated group, indicating its anti-inflammatory property. The excitatory neurotransmitters, L-glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid, were also found to be attenuated with TT saponins, implying restoration of neuronal damage and synaptic activity caused by high amount of glutamate due to excess TNF-α in brain and reversing the nociceptive threshold lowered due to aspartate. Thus, TT(S) is peripherally and centrally active in lowering the inflammatory mediators, reversing the neuronal damage and increasing the nociceptive threshold caused due to peripheral neuropathy.",

The TTE-inoclated animals revealed significantly decreased stool oocysts numbers (P<0.05) when compared to the TTE untreated animals. Also, TTE-treated animals showed more increased body weight gains (P<0.05) than the TTE untreated animals. These results demonstrate that TTE produce anticoccidial activities against E. tenella.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TF extract was prepared with 30% ethanol as solvent. The 1% TF extract with or without 0.1% HC was applied to the back skin daily for 24 days. RESULTS: 1% TF extract with 0.1% HC improved AD symptoms and reduced TEWL and symptom scores in AD mice. 1% TF extract with 0.1% HC inhibited skin inflammation through decrease in inflammatory cells infiltration as well as inhibition of Orai-1 expression in skin tissues. TF extract inhibited Orai-1 activity in Orai-1-STIM1 cooverexpressing HEK293T cells but increased TRPV3 activity in TRPV3-overexpressing HEK293T cells. TF extract decreased β-hexosaminidase release in RBL-2H3 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that the topical application of TF extract improves skin inflammation in AD mice, and the mechanism for this effect appears to be related to the modulation of calcium channels and mast cell activation. This outcome suggests that the combination of TF and steroids could be a more effective and safe approach for AD treatment."

Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of treating premenopausal women with HSDD with Tribulus terrestris and its effect on the serum levels of testosterone. We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with 40 premenopausal women reporting diminished libido, receiving T. terrestris or placebo. The questionnaires FSFI and the QS-F were used to evaluate sexual dysfunction before and after treatment. Patients treated with T. terrestris experienced improvement in total score of FSFI (p < .001) and domains \"desire\" (p < .001), \"sexual arousal\" (p = .005), \"lubrication\" (p = .001), \"orgasm\" (p <.001), \"pain\" (p = .030) and \"satisfaction\" (p = .001). Treatment with placebo did not improve the scores for the \"lubrication\" and \"pain\". QS-F scores showed that patients using T. terrestris had improvements in \"desire\" (p = .012), \"sexual arousal/lubrication\" (p = .002), \"pain\" (p = .031), \"orgasm\" (p = .004) and \"satisfaction\" (p = .001). Women treated with placebo did not score improvements. Women receiving T. terrestris had increased levels of free (p = .046) and bioavailable (p < .048) testosterone. T. terrestris might be a safe alternative for the treatment of premenopausal women with HSDD as it was effective in reducing the symptoms, probably due to an increase in the serum levels of free and bioavailable testosterone.",

      "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris (T. terrestris) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including inflammation, edema and hypertension. The aqueous and ethanol extracts of T. terrestris contain alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, quinines and phenolic compounds. Tribulusamide D is a compound that has been isolated from the ethanol extract of T. terrestris. The present study investigated the anti‑inflammatory effect of tribulusamide D on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Tribulusamide D inhibited the production of LPS‑induced nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2, by reducing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase‑2 expression, respectively. The expression of these genes associated with inflammation was determined using reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Furthermore, tribulusamide D reduced the expression of LPS‑induced inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)‑6, IL‑10 and tumor necrosis factor‑α. They were quantified using an enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, the present study confirmed that the inhibitory effects of tribulusamide D on the inflammatory response were mediated through inactivation of mitogen‑activated protein kinase p38 and inhibition of nuclear localization of nuclear factor‑B, which were also determined by western blot analysis. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to demonstrate that tribulusamide D exerts anti‑inflammatory activity by altering the expression of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, indicating that tribulusamide D could be developed as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.",

Previous studies have indicated that it is effective in improving inflammation by regulating tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑6, IL‑10, nitric oxide (NO) and cyclooxygenase (COX)‑2. However, the effects and mechanism of action of T. terrestris on osteoarthritis (OA) remain unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the ethanolic extract of T. terrestris (ETT) in a monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)‑induced OA animal model. OA was induced in LEW/SSNHSD rats by intra‑articular injection of MIA. Morphometric changes and parameters of the tibial trabecular bone were determined using micro‑computed tomography. The molecular mechanisms of ETT in OA were investigated using reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and gelatin zymogram analysis. Treatment with ETT attenuated MIA‑induced OA, and this effect was mediated by the downregulation of NO synthase 2, COX‑2, TNF‑α and IL‑6. Furthermore, the ETT‑mediated attenuation of OA was also dependent on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases‑2 and ‑9. The results of the current study indicate that further evaluation of the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of MIA‑induced OA by ETT are required, and may support the development of ETT as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as OA.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) of T. terrestris hydro-alcoholic extract were administered both orally (60 minutes before pancreatitis induction, p.o.) and intra-peritoneally (30 minutes before pancreatitis induction, i.p.) to different groups of mice (n=6). Pancreatitis was induced by ﬁve injections (i.p.) of cerulein 50μg/kg body weight with 1 hr intervals. Animals were euthanized 5 hr after the last injection of cerulein and tissue injures were assessed biochemically and pathologically. RESULTS: T. terrestris extract 200 and 400mg/kg (p.o.) and T. terrestris extract 400 mg/kg (i.p.) reduced pancreatic tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and serum amylase and lipase levels and alleviated histological parameters. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that T. terrestris hydro-alcoholic extract was effective in protecting against experimental acute pancreatitis and possibly the efficacy depends on dose and route of administration."

The present study was designed to explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of treatment with TT extracts and the involvement of androgens, the androgen receptor (AR), insulin growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1) and the IGF‑1 receptor (IGF‑1R). A total of 32 Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into groups as follows: Control; TT, treated with TT extracts, E, high intensity exercise; E+TT, high intensity exercise plus TT treatment. The rats of the E and E+TT groups underwent high intensity exercise with a progressively increasing load for 5 weeks, and TT extracts were intragastrically administered in the TT and E+TT rats 30 min prior to training. TT extract composition was analyzed using ultra‑high performance liquid chromatography‑quadrupole‑time of flight mass spectrometry. Testosterone and IGF‑1 plasma levels and AR, IGF‑1R and myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein levels in muscles were determined by ELISA and western blotting, respectively. The saponins tigogenin and diosgenin comprised ~71.35% of the total peak area. Compared with the E group, TT extracts increased the testosterone and IGF‑1 plasma levels, and AR, IGF‑1R and MHC protein levels in the gastrocnemius of rats undergoing high intensity exercise, accompanied with increased body weight and gastrocnemius weight. In conclusion, the effect of TT extracts on the performance of high intensity exercise rats may be attributed to increased levels of circulating testosterone and IGF‑1 and increased AR and IGF‑1R protein expression levels in the gastrocnemius, resulting in increased muscle weight and increased MHC in the gastrocnemius. The present study provided preliminary evidence supporting the use of TT extracts as a dietary supplement for the promotion of skeletal muscle mass increase and the enhancement of athletic performance in humans performing high intensity exercise.",

A randomised, triple-blind, controlled trial design was used for this study. The participants were 80 postmenopausal women aged 50-60 years. A demographic data form and the Menopause Rating Scale were used to collect data. The women were randomly divided into two groups, each of which received either an Aphrodit capsule or a placebo twice a day for four weeks. The two bottles looked exactly the same, so that the investigator and the participants were not aware of the contents of the bottles. Each Aphrodit capsule contained 40 mg of Tribulus terrestris, 12.27 mg of Zingiber officinale, 3 mg of Crocus sativus extract, and 11 mg of Cinnamomum zeylanicum, while the placebo capsules contained 50 mg of starch. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. A statistically significant change was reported in the menopausal symptoms of the intervention group compared with the placebo group.

METHODS: Twenty four female Wistar rats of regular estrus cycle were divided into four groups of six animals each. The negative control group received 1 mL of 0.5% carboxy methyl cellulose. The animals of the other groups were treated with letrozole (1 mg/kg) for 21 days for induction of PCOS. The animals of the positive control group were sacrificed on the 22nd day. In the test and standard groups, the treatment was started from the 22nd day and continued for a further 28 days. The test group was treated with hydroalcoholic extract of the combination of WS and TT (198 mg/kg) and the standard group with clomiphene citrate (1 mg/kg). Throughout the study, vaginal smears were collected daily from each animal for the determination of different phases of the estrus cycle. After completion of the treatment schedule all the animals of each group were sacrificed; analysis of hormones, total cholesterol, blood glucose, ovarian and uterine weight, and histopathological study of the ovary were carried out. RESULTS: The combination of the test drugs showed significant effects in normalizing the estrus cycle after being altered by letrozole. In the positive control group follicle-stimulating hormone level was decreased although luteinizing hormone, estradiole, and testosterone levels were increased (p < 0.05), however, after treatment the reverse effect was observed in the level of these hormones. Significant reduction in serum total cholesterol was also observed (p < 0.05). The test drugs decreased ovarian weight, and uterine weight was also returned to normalcy. Histopathology of the ovary showed almost normal ovary. CONCLUSION: The above findings indicate the effectiveness of the combination of hydroalcoholic extract of WS and TT against letrozole induced polycystic ovarian syndrome in rat. This validates the usefulness of combination in PCOS and other related disorders as mentioned by Unani physicians."

PARTICIPANTS AND DESIGN: Phase IV, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in parallel groups. This study included 180 males aged between 18 and 65 years with mild or moderate ED and with or without HSDD: 90 were randomized to TT and 90 to placebo. Patients with ED and hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome were included in the study. In the trial, an herbal medicine intervention of Bulgarian origin was used (Tribestan®, Sopharma AD). Each Tribestan film-coated tablet contains the active substance Tribulus terrestris, herba extractum siccum (35-45:1) 250mg which is standardized to furostanol saponins (not less than 112.5mg). Each patient received orally 3×2 film-coated tablets daily after meals, during the 12-week treatment period. At the end of each month, participants' sexual function, including ED, was assessed by International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire and Global Efficacy Question (GEQ). Several biochemical parameters were also determined. The primary outcome measure was the change in IIEF score after 12 weeks of treatment. Complete randomization (random sorting using maximum allowable% deviation) with an equal number of patients in each sequence was used. This randomization algorithm has the restriction that unequal treatment allocation is not allowed; that is, all groups must have the same target sample size. Patients, investigational staff, and data collectors were blinded to treatment. All outcome assessors were also blinded to group allocation. RESULTS: 86 patients in each group completed the study. The IIEF score improved significantly in the TT group compared with the placebo group (Р<0.0001). For intention-to-treat (ITT) there was a statistically significant difference in change from baseline of IIEF scores. The difference between TT and placebo was 2.70 (95% CI 1.40, 4.01) for the ITT population. A statistically significant difference between TT and placebo was found for Intercourse Satisfaction (p=0.0005), Orgasmic Function (p=0.0325), Sexual Desire (p=0.0038), Overall Satisfaction (p=0.0028) as well as in GEQ responses (p<0.0001), in favour of TT. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events (AEs) between the two groups and the therapy was well tolerated. There were no drug-related serious AEs. Following the 12-week treatment period, significant improvement in sexual function was observed with TT compared with placebo in men with mild to moderate ED. TT was generally well tolerated for the treatment of ED.",

METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, during 18 months. A total of 45 healthy sexually active postmenopausal women reporting diminished libido were selected to participate in the study and were randomly assigned to receive 750 mg/d of T terrestris or placebo for 120 days. Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes. All participants answered the Female Sexual Function Index and the Sexual Quotient-female version questionnaires and had their serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, total testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin measured. RESULTS: A total of 36 participants completed the study, because 3 from each group were excluded due to side effects and 3 dropped out due to personal reasons. FSFI questionnaire results demonstrated an improvement in all domains in both groups (P < 0.05) except for lubrication which was improved only in the study group. QS-F results showed a significant improvement in the domains of desire (P < 0.01), arousal/lubrication (P = 0.02), pain (P = 0.02), and anorgasmia (P < 0.01) in women who used T terrestris, whereas no improvement was observed in the placebo group (P > 0.05). Moreover, free and bioavailable testosterone levels showed a significant increase in the T terrestris group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Tribulus terrestris might be a safe alternative for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women, because it was effective in reducing symptoms with few side effects. Its probable mechanism of action involves an increase in the serum levels of free and bioavailable testosterone.",

Here, we aimed to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a combination of tryptophan, Satureja montana, Tribulus terrestris, Phyllanthus emblica extracts in order to improve sexual quality of life in patients with premature ejaculation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients attending to 5 urological centers from January 2015 to March 2015, due to premature ejaculation were enrolled in this study. At the enrolment visit, all subjects underwent self-administered IIEF-5, Male Sexual Health Questionnaire-Ejaculation Disorder (MSHQEjD), PEDT and IELTS (calculated as mean from that perceived by partner and that perceived by patient) and underwent urological visit and laboratory examinations. All patients received one tablet per day of a combination of tryptophan, Satureja montana, Tribulus terrestris, Phyllanthus emblica extracts for 3 months (Group A). After 3 months all patients underwent follow-up visit with the same investigations that have been carried out in the enrolment visit. The results were compared with a cohort of patients enrolled in the same period in another urological center and considered as a control group (Group B). All patients in the control group underwent counseling and sexual behavioral treatment without any pharmacological compound. RESULTS: At the follow-up analysis, significant changes in terms of IELT in the Group A (mean difference: 31.90; p &lt; 0.05) at 3 months and versus Group B at the intergroup analysis (mean difference: 30.30; p &lt; 0.05) were reported. In the group A, significant differences from baseline to last follow- up were observed relative to IIEF-5 (mean difference: 1.04; p &lt; 0.05), PEDT (mean difference: -2.57; p &lt; 0.05) and FSH (mean difference: -16.46; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, patients affected by PE may significantly benefit from oral therapy with a combination of tryptophan, Satureja montana, Tribulus terrestris, Phyllanthus emblica extracts in terms of IELT and PEDT scores improvement.",

A rat overtraining model was established and animals were treated with TT extracts (120 mg/kg body mass) 30 min before each training session. Serum levels of testosterone and corticosterone and levels of androgen receptor (AR) and insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in the liver, gastrocnemius, and soleus were determined by ELISA and Western blot. Treatment of rats with TT saponins significantly improved the performance of the overtraining rats, reflected by the extension of time to exhaustion, with a concomitant increase in body mass, relative mass, and protein levels of gastrocnemius. Overtraining alone induced a significant decrease in the serum level of testosterone. In contrast, treatment with TT saponins dramatically increased the serum level of testosterone in overtraining rats to about 150% of control and 216% of overtraining groups, respectively. In addition, TT saponins resulted in a further significant increase in AR in gastrocnemius and significantly suppressed the overtraining-induced increase in IGF-1R in the liver. These results indicated that TT saponins increased performance, body mass, and gastrocnemius mass of rats undergoing overtraining, which might be attributed to the changes in androgen-AR axis and IGF-1R signaling."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of T. terrestris on semen quality and physiological parameters. Sixty-five men with abnormal semen evaluation were included in this study, in which they were prescribed with oral administration of Androsten® (250 mg of Tribulus terrestris dried extract per capsule). Body fat percentage, lean muscle mass gain, fluctuation in steroid hormone levels and all semen parameters were analysed during the period of treatment. The results demonstrated that decrease in the percentage of body fat and increase in lean mass were significant, as well as increase in dihydrotestosterone levels. Complete semen analysis evaluated at the end of treatment showed significant enhancement in sperm concentration, motility and liquefaction time. Protodioscin, the main phytochemical agent of the Tribulus genus, acts on sertoli cells, germ cell proliferation and growth of seminiferous tubules. This component is known to convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which plays important roles in male attributes.

METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that included 60 postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction. The women were divided into two groups, placebo group and Tribulus group, and evaluated by using the Sexual Quotient-female version (SQ-F) and Female Intervention Efficacy Index (FIEI) questionnaires. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in age, age at menopause, civil status, race, and religion. In the evaluation with the SQ-F questionnaire, there were significant differences between the placebo (7.6 ± 3.2) and Tribulus (10.2 ± 3.2) groups in the domains of desire and sexual interest (p ≤ 0.001), foreplay (3.3 ± 1.5 versus 4.2 ± 1.0) (p ≤ 0.01), arousal and harmonious interaction with the partner (5.7 ± 2.1 versus 7.2 ± 2.6) (p ≤ 0.01), and comfort in sexual intercourse (6.5 ± 2.4 versus 8.0 ± 1.9) (p ≤ 0.01). There was no significant difference between the placebo and Tribulus groups in the domains of orgasm and sexual satisfaction (p = 0.28). In the FIEI questionnaire, there was a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in the domains of vaginal lubrication during coitus and/or foreplay (20 versus 83.3%), sensation in the genitalia during sexual intercourse or other stimuli (16.7 versus 76.7%), sensation in the genital region (20 versus 70%), sexual intercourse and/or other sexual stimulations (13.3 versus 43.3%), and the ability to reach orgasm (20% versus 73.3%). There was no significant difference in adverse effects between the two groups.

The species is highly important in context to therapeutic uses and provides important active principles responsible for treatment of various diseases and also used as tonic. It is widely distributed in tropical regions of India and the world. However, status of its genetic diversity remained concealed due to lack of research work in this species. In present study, genetic diversity and structure of different populations of T. terrestris from north India was examined at molecular level using newly developed Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. In total, 20 primers produced 48 alleles in a size range of 100-500 bp with maximum (4) fragments amplified by TTMS-1, TTMS-25 and TTMS-33. Mean Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) and Marker Index (MI) were 0.368 and 1.01, respectively. Dendrogram showed three groups, one of which was purely containing accessions from Rajasthan while other two groups corresponded to Punjab and Haryana regions with intermixing of few other accessions. Analysis of molecular variance partitioned 76 % genetic variance within populations and 24 % among populations. Bayesian model based STRUCTURE analysis detected two genetic stocks for analyzed germplasm and also detected some admixed individuals. Different geographical populations of this species showed high level of genetic diversity. Results of present study can be useful in identifying diverse accessions and management of this plant resource. Moreover, the novel SSR markers developed can be utilized for various genetic analyses in this species in future."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of aqueous extracts of Tribulus terrestris (TT) against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) dysfunction in vitro. METHODS: HUVECs were pre-incubated for 60 min with TT (30 and 3 μg/mL respectively) or 10(-5) mol/L valsartan (as positive controls) and then the injured endothelium model was established by applying 100 μg/mL ox-LDL for 24 h. Cell viability of HUVECs was observed by real-time cell electronic sensing assay and apoptosis rate by Annexin V/PI staining. The cell migration assay was performed with a transwell insert system. Cytoskeleton remodeling was observed by immunofluorescence assay. The content of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was assessed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometer. Key genes associated with the metabolism of ox-LDL were chosen for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to explore the possible mechanism of TT against oxidized LDL-induced endothelial dysfunction. RESULTS: TT suppressed ox-LDL-induced HUVEC proliferation and apoptosis rates significantly (41.1% and 43.5% after treatment for 3 and 38 h, respectively; P<0.05). It also prolonged the HUVEC survival time and postponed the cell's decaying stage (from the 69th h to over 100 h). According to the immunofluorescence and transwell insert system assay, TT improved the endothelial cytoskeletal network, and vinculin expression and increased cell migration. Additionally, TT regulated of the synthesis of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (P<0.05). Both 30 and 3 μg/mL TT demonstrated similar efficacy to valsartan. TT normalized the increased mRNA expression of PI3Kα and Socs3. It also decreased mRNA expression of Akt1, AMPKα1, JAK2, LepR and STAT3 induced by ox-LDL. The most notable changes were JAK2, LepR, PI3Kα, Socs3 and STAT3. CONCLUSIONS: TT demonstrated potential lowering lipid benefits, anti-hypertension and endothelial protective effects. It also suggested that the JAK2/STAT3 and/or PI3K/AKT pathway might be a very important pathway which was involved in the pharmacological mechanism of TT as the vascular protective agent.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation is induced by the expression of cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2), which is an important mediator of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. Tribulus terrestris (T. terrestris) is known to have a beneficial effect on inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of N‑trans‑ρ‑caffeoyl tyramine (CT) isolated from T. terrestris on the production of nitric oxide (NO), and the expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokines and COX‑2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. We also aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We found that the ethanolic extract of T. terrestris (EETT) and CT inhibited the production of NO, tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), interleukin (IL)‑6 and IL‑10 in the LPS‑stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in a dose‑dependent manner. They were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, CT markedly suppressed the expression of COX‑2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in response to LPS stimulation. Furthermore, CT markedly decreased p‑c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (p‑JNK) protein expression in LPS‑stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. COX-2 and p-JNK were measured by western blot analysis. Taken together, these findings indicate that CT isolated from T. terrestris is a novel and potent modulator of inflammatory responses. Thus, it may prove benefiical to further evaluate CT as a possible treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activities of the extracts were examined using disc and well diffusion methods and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ethanol extracts were determined against these microorganisms using agar and broth dilution methods. Chlorhexidine was used as positive control. RESULTS: Tribulus terrestris extract exhibited good antibacterial activity against all bacteria. Antibacterial activity of mixed extract was evaluated and exhibited that mixed extract was more effective against all bacteria than any of the cases alone which indicates the synergistic effect between these three extracts (p˂0.05). No strain showed resistance against these extracts. In agar dilution, Tribulus terrestris exhibited MIC values ranging from 35.0 to 20.0 mg/ml and mixed extract showed MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 5.0 mg/ml. The results of broth dilution method were consistent with the findings of the agar dilution method. CONCLUSION: This in-vitro study was a preliminary evaluation of antibacterial activity of the plants. It provided scientific evidence to support uses of T. terrestris and its mixture with C. bursa-pastoris and G. glabra for the treatment of oral infections. In-vivo studies are also required to better evaluate the effect of these extracts."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty adult Swiss strain mice were divided into six groups. Animals of Groups I and II served as untreated and vehicle-treated controls, while that of Groups III and IV were administered with MTZ (500 mg/kg BW/day) and TT (200 mg/kg BW/day) alone for 28 days, respectively. Low (100 mg/kg BW/day) and high (200 mg/kg BW/day) doses of TT along with MTZ (500 mg/kg BW/day) were administered for 28 days in the mice of Groups V and VI, respectively. Twenty four hours after the last treatment, all the animals were euthanized to study the histological changes in the testis and sperm count in the epididymis. Testicular functional markers, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, were also assessed in the mice of all the groups. RESULTS: Metronidazole caused marked alterations in the testicular weight, spermatogenesis, activities of antioxidant enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and the level of LPO. The epididymal sperm count also declined significantly in MTZ-treated group. These changes were partially restored following co-administration of 500 mg/kg BW/day of MTZ and 100 mg/kg BW/day of TT. However, in the mice co-administered with 500 mg/kg BW/day of MTZ and 200 mg/kg BW/day of TT, the changes reverted back completely, similar to that of the controls. CONCLUSION: The fruit extract of TT ameliorates the MTZ-induced alterations in the testis.",

Many drugs prescribed specifically to treat PCOS have side effects; however, previous studies suggest that natural therapeutics including botanicals may be less invasive and equally effective for the management of PCOS. METHODS: In the present study, plants were screened for antiandrogenic activity using the RIKILT yeast Androgen bioAssay (RAA). Selected positive plants were subsequently tested for their efficacy against PCOS induced by estradiol valerate (EV) in rat models. RESULTS: RAA revealed the antiandrogenic property of Nardostachys jatamansi DC (NJ), Tribulus terrestris L. (TT), and Embelia tsjeriam-cottam DC (EJ), whereas Whithania somnifera Dunal (WS), Symplocos racemosa Roxb. (SR), and Helicteres isora L. (HI) exhibited androgenic properties. EJ also exhibited mild androgenic activity and therefore was excluded from further study. EV administration reduced the weight gain and disrupted cyclicity in all rats. NJ and TT extract treatment normalized estrous cyclicity and steroidal hormonal levels and regularized ovarian follicular growth. CONCLUSION: The in vitro antiandrogenic activity of plant extracts and their positive effects on different parameters of PCOS were proved in vivo.",

Efficacy analysis included results of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels together with total and free testosterone, and the patient and physician assessments. There was a statistically significant improvement in total FSFI scores (P < 0.0001) post-treatment, with improvement among 106 (88.33%) subjects. There was a statistically significant (P < 0.0001) increase in the level of DHEA, while the levels of both serum testosterone (P = 0.284) and free testosterone decreased (P < 0.0001). Most adverse events recorded were related to the gastrointestinal tract. Physical examination showed no significant changes post-treatment. Based on the results, it is concluded that the T. terrestris extract is safe and effective in the treatment of female sexual dysfunction."

They have been reported to possess an antitumor activity exerted by regulating various signaling pathways in the cell. Although the mechanisms of action of saponin extracts from various plants have been widely studied, limited data are available about TT. The present study aimed to analyze the impact of saponin extract from TT on cell processes in breast carcinoma cell lines. The variations in expression of a group of 32 selected genes were examined by real-time PCR after saponin treatment of MCF7 and MCF10A cell lines. Only three genes - CXCR4, CCR7 and BCL2, showed changes in their mRNA levels after the application of the herb extract. While CXCR4 expression was reduced in both cell lines, CCR7 and BCL2 levels decreased only in tumorigenic MCF7 cells, implying cell-specificity of the saponin action. Our results suggested that TT extract containing saponins was likely to affect the processes of apoptosis and metastasizing of cancer cells. Further in vivo studies will show its applicability as an anticancer therapeutic agent. KEYWORDS: saponins, Tribulus terrestris, breast cancer, CXCR4, CCR7, BCL2."
