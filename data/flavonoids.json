      "abstract": "As a prevalent metabolic disorder, the increasing incidence of diabetes imposes a significant burden on global healthcare. Flavonoids in natural phytochemical products exhibit notable hypoglycemic properties, making them potential alternatives for diabetes treatment. This article summarizes the hypoglycemic properties of flavonoid subcategories studied in recent years, including flavones, isoflavones, flavonols, flavanols, and others. The relevant targets and signal pathways, such as α-amylase, α-glucosidase, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)/eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α)/activation transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), etc., are also elaborated. Additionally, flavonoids have also been demonstrated to modulate the gut microbiota and its metabolites. Through the aforementioned mechanisms, flavonoids mainly suppress carbohydrate metabolism and gluconeogenesis; facilitate glucose uptake, glycogenesis, and insulin secretion; and mitigate insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, etc. Notably, several studies have indicated that certain flavonoids displayed synergistic hypoglycemic effects. In conclusion, this article provides a comprehensive review of the hypoglycemic effects of the flavonoids investigated in recent years, aiming to offer theoretical insights for their further exploration."

      "abstract": "The use of antibiotics has greatly improved the treatment of bacterial infections; however, its abuse and misuse has led to a rapid rise in multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Therefore, the search for new antimicrobial strategies has become critical. Natural flavonoids, a class of widely existing phytochemicals, have gained significant research interest for their diverse biological activities and antibacterial effects on various drug-resistant bacteria. This review summarizes the latest research progress on flavonoids, with a particular focus on several flavonoids exhibiting certain antibacterial activity, and explores their antibacterial mechanisms, including disruption of cell membranes and cell walls, inhibition of proteins and nucleic acids, interference with signal transduction, suppression of efflux pump activity, and inhibition of biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Additionally, we have reviewed the synergistic combinations of flavonoids with antibiotics, such as the combination of quercetin with colistin or EGCG with tetracycline, which significantly enhance therapeutic efficacy."

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered a significant global health issue related to serious metabolic disorders. However, effective pharmacological treatments are still limited. Flavonoids, a wide group of polyphenol substances, exert anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects in preclinical data. Thus, implementing these research findings in clinical practice could significantly help manage NAFLD and its consequences. This narrative review assesses the therapeutic potential of flavonoids in managing NAFLD. The research collected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs from the past five years concerning the impact of flavonoids on NAFLD. A total of 20 studies were selected according to predetermined inclusion criteria, comprising thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven meta-analyses. The research underscores the beneficial effects of flavonoids in the management of NAFLD through the enhancement of lipid metabolism, the reduction in hepatic steatosis, and the provision of anti-inflammatory actions. Clinical trials demonstrate that interventions rich in flavonoids, including quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, naringenin, and isoflavones, substantially reduce liver fat content and enhance liver enzyme profiles, with certain compounds exhibiting superior efficacy in particular subgroups, such as older adults and females. Nonetheless, whereas these therapies significantly diminish hepatic steatosis, their effect on fibrosis is constrained. To sum up, flavonoids exhibit significant potential as supplementary treatments for NAFLD by enhancing liver function, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. Additional extensive controlled clinical trials are necessary to create uniform treatment methods and ascertain their long-term therapeutic advantages.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder primarily caused by the overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). However, the therapeutic efficacy of traditional drugs is often limited due to their inability to penetrate the stratum corneum. Microneedles (MNs) are designed to penetrate the stratum corneum, enabling direct drug delivery to the epidermis. In this study, a new Dendrobium polysaccharide-based composite microneedle (DOP/CCF/PLGA@Adap-MN) delivery system was developed. Dendrobium polysaccharide (DOP) was utilized as the microneedle matrix, loaded with the Celosia cristata flavonoids (CCF) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) adapalene nanoparticles (PLGA@Adap NPs). DOP not only enhanced the mechanical properties and transdermal efficiency of the microneedles but also provided intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity. CCF effectively inhibited the growth of P. acnes, while PLGA@Adap NPs slowly released adapalene to promote acne healing. In vivo studies using a P. acnes-induced mice model demonstrated that this microneedle system effectively reduced skin swelling, inhibited bacterial growth, and decreased inflammatory cell numbers in the skin. The use of bioactive DOP as a microneedle matrix, combined with sustained-release technology, provides a multifaceted and synergistic approach to acne treatment."

      "abstract": "Radix Hedysari is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine and food. It has a long history of clinical application and is used to improve health and treat various diseases. Hedysari polysaccharides, flavonoids, saponins, and alkaloids are the main components of Radix Hedysari. Hedysari flavonoids are the most important natural active ingredients in Radix Hedysari and have a variety of pharmacological effects. At present, Hedysari flavonoids have shown great application prospects in the development of drugs for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, osteoporosis, skeletal muscle injury, atherosclerosis, hepatic fibrosis, immune regulation, hypoglycemia, and renal fibrosis. This paper reviewed the extraction, separation, and content determination methods and chemical constituents of flavonoids from Radix Hedysari. The core electronic databases used for literature retrieval included Baidu Literature, Baidu Literature, WangFang Datas, CNKI, VIP Datas, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. \"Radix Hedysari\", \"Hong qi\", \"Flavonoid\", \"Hedysari Flavonoids\" and \"pharmacological effects\", \"extraction\" and \"structure\" were used as the search terms from database creation to 30 October 2024. Multiple studies have shown that Radix Hedysari flavonoids have important pharmacological effects, such as cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, by inhibiting tumor cell growth, inducing tumor cell apoptosis, and enhancing immune function. The antioxidant effect, through the regulation of LDH, SOD, malondialdehyde and other enzymes and the expression of antioxidant-related factors, can improve osteoporosis by promoting osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, reducing calcium loss, increasing bone mineral density, maintaining bone balance and improving bone quality. These effects include reducing oxidation; preventing thrombosis; enhancing endothelial function; regulating blood lipid levels to improve anti-atherosclerosis, anti-pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis performance; improving atherosclerosis; reducing skeletal muscle damage; and exerting immunomodulatory effects, such as regulating various cytokines, immune cells, immune organs and related signaling pathways. This work provides a theoretical foundation for further studies on the structure, mechanism and clinical application of Radix Hedysari flavonoids."

      "abstract": "Herbal medicine has been used since ancient times for the treatment of various diseases and the improvement of human health. In research, the extraction process serves as a critical initial step for isolating and purifying key bioactive components from crude plant extracts. Despite its importance, the extraction stage often receives less attention and remains underexplored. In India, traditional techniques, such as maceration, Soxhlet extraction, steam distillation, and cold pressing, are still widely used for processing medicinal plants. However, these conventional methods suffer from limitations, including low selectivity, reduced yields, prolonged processing times, and significant environmental and safety concerns due to the extensive use of organic solvents. To address these challenges, innovative extraction techniques have emerged in recent years, offering greater efficiency, selectivity, and environmental sustainability. Notable advancements include Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAE), Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SCFE), Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE), Subcritical Water Extraction (SWE), and Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (USE). Among these, MAE has garnered significant attention for its potential to optimize extraction efficiency while minimizing resource consumption. This review provides a comprehensive comparison of different extraction methods, with a particular focus on the benefits of MAE. Furthermore, it explores the application of MAE-extracted flavonoids in the treatment of epilepsy, leveraging their proven ability to eliminate free radicals effectively. It also aims to highlight the advantages of adopting MAE in therapeutic contexts, offering novel insights into its role in enhancing the efficacy of flavonoid-based interventions. This work underscores the critical need for advancing extraction technologies to meet modern safety, environmental, and therapeutic demands."

      "abstract": "The deterioration of fruit quality during refrigeration is a typical symptom of the storage and transportation of Lycium barbarum L. (wolfberry) fruit after harvest. This study aimed to explore the impact of melatonin (MT) treatment on the fruit quality of wolfberry stored at 4°C, using combined transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses. In this study, about 15% of the flavonoid metabolites differed significantly after MT treatment in yellow-fleshed wolfberry, especially for flavanols, flavanones, and flavonols. MT treatment enhanced esterified carotenoid content in red-fleshed wolfberry postharvest. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that MT-induced upregulation of LbaF3'H, LbaHQT and LbaCHS1 might contribute to the increased flavonoids in yellow-flesh wolfberry, and that MT-induced upregulation of LbaPSY, LbaCRTISO and LbaCYCB are responsible for the increased carotenoids in red-flesh wolfberry. Coexpression network analysis showed that several transcription factors such as LbaGATA are involved in MT-mediated regulation of flavonoids and carotenoids. Dual luciferase assay evidenced that LbaGATA and LbaRKD5 depress the expression of LbaPSY. Overall, this study underscores MT's role in maintaining wolfberry postharvest quality during storage, providing a solid foundation of food application.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disruption is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, marked by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. Hypoxia-inducible factor 3α (Hif3α) has emerged as a key regulator of inflammatory and oxidative pathways. To evaluate the impacts of circadian disruption on AD progression and investigate the therapeutic potential of bamboo leaf flavonoids (BLFs), C57BL/6N mice (normal mice) and APP/PS1 transgenic mice (AD mice) were exposed to circadian disruption via randomized light exposure and stress, as the in vivo model. Then, BLFs were administered to assess effects on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and organ damage. Next, Nissl body staining and Aβ protein immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the effects of BLFs on brain pathology. Through transcriptome sequencing, key factors and the related pathway were screened out. In vitro, molecular mechanisms were explored in PC12 cells treated with Aβ42 and Hif3α siRNA fragments. Results demonstrated that circadian disruption increased oxidative stress and early liver and kidney damage degrees, with greater severity in AD mice. BLFs partially reversed oxidative damage and reduced Aβ deposition. Transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of Hif3α in circadian-disrupted mice, linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. In vitro, the knockdown of Hif3α reduced inflammation and normalized protein expression, which could be regulated by BLFs and suppressed AD progression. In conclusion, circadian disruption exacerbated AD progression via regulating Hif3α/Rab7/TNFα/IL1β pathway. BLFs offered neuroprotection roles by mitigating inflammation and oxidative damage, highlighting Hif3α as a promising target for AD therapy and biomarker development.",

Twenty-six of the known isolates were reported for the first time in Lablab Flos Alba. And nine constituted new records for the Lablab genus. The effects of compounds 1-12 on the NLRP3 inflammasome were further explored by using LPS/Nigericin-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) as in vitro model. Elisa assay revealed that compounds 6, 8, and 12 could significantly inhibit the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Mechanistic studies via Western blotting demonstrated their dual regulatory effects: pretreatment with compounds 6, 8, and 12 downregulated NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β expression prior to LPS stimulation, while post-treatment with LPS/nigericin markedly reduced levels of cleaved IL-1β and cleaved caspase-1. These findings indicate that the anti-inflammatory activity of compounds 6, 8, and 12 arises from their interference with both the priming phase and the activation phase of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling."

However, their pharmacological effects and mechanisms in suppressing breast cancer metastasis remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the inhibitory effects and underlying mechanisms of TFLS on breast cancer metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antiproliferative, migratory, and invasive activities of breast cancer cells following TFLS treatment were evaluated using CCK-8, wound-healing, and transwell assays. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers were evaluated via Western blot analysis. The anti-metastatic effects of TFLS were further validated in vivo using zebrafish and mouse models. Network pharmacology methodology was utilized to predict potential targets and signaling pathways, which were subsequently corroborated by Western blot. Potential active compounds were identified through molecular docking, and the chemical constituents of TFLS were analyzed and characterized using UPLC-QTOF/MS. RESULTS: TFLS suppressed the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, with IC50 values of 44.47 μg/mL and 37.35 μg/mL at 72 h, respectively. It effectively suppressed breast cancer metastasis in vitro, demonstrated by a marked reduction in cellular motility and invasiveness, alongside the reversal of EMT. Consistent with pathway enrichment analysis, network pharmacology revealed that TFLS reduced the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, JNK, ERK, and p38 in breast cancer cells. Molecular docking identified seven potential active ingredients, and UPLC-MS/MS confirmed the presence of key compounds, including procyanidin A2. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: TFLS effectively inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro by reversing the EMT phenotype, while suppressing metastasis in vivo. These effects are likely mediated via the attenuation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways.",

Additionally, the fermentation process, a traditional method of food preservation, not only extends the shelf life of foods but also promotes the formation of natural bioactive components and enhances organoleptic properties. This study aimed to investigate the effects of UV radiation and fermentation on caper (Capparis spinosa L.) berries through a factorial experiment designed as a completely randomized design with three replications. Four levels of UV radiation: control (no radiation), UV-B radiation, UV-C radiation, and UV-B + C radiation were applied. Following the UV treatment, fermentation was initiated, with four sampling stages conducted throughout the fermentation period (fresh fruits or control, and days 15, 30, and 45 during fermentation). The results indicated significant increases in total phenol content, flavonoids, anthocyanins, antioxidant activity, and the activity of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in caper berries treated with UV-B and, particularly, UV-C radiation. The levels of most phenolic compounds, including caffeic acid, gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, cinnamic acid, rosmarinic acid, p-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid, significantly increased under UV-C, UV-B, and UV-B + C exposure compared with the control (no UV application). Regardless of the UV treatment, fermentation significantly elevated the levels of phenolic acids such as caffeic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, m-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, rosmarinic acid, and vanillic acid, resulting in concentrations that were considerably higher in fermented fruits 45 days post-fermentation than in fresh fruits. Additionally, the total phenol and flavonoid contents in UV-treated fruits on day 45 of fermentation exceeded those in fresh fruits. In contrast, samples not exposed to UV radiation showed no significant changes in these attributes during fermentation. Overall, irrespective of the UV treatment, fermentation of the fruits up to day 30 led to increases in antioxidant activity, PAL activity, anthocyanin content, cinnamic acid, and p-coumaric acid in caper berries. However, the level of cinnamic acid decreased on day 45 compared with day 30. Ultimately, caper fruit treated with UV irradiation and fermented exhibited enhanced health potential due to their unique characteristics."

Expanding the scope of indications and enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy are key goals for continued advancement. Flavonoids modulate the tumor‑immunosuppressive microenvironment. Integrating flavonoids with immunotherapeutic modalities, including cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive immune‑cell therapy, has potential in terms of augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy. The present review aimed to summarize flavonoids that enhance cancer immunotherapy, focusing on their underlying mechanisms and the application of nanotechnology to overcome inherent limitations such as poor solubility, low bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and instability under physiological conditions, thereby highlighting the potential of flavonoids in advancing cancer immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "A common and serious side effect of diabetes is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which is characterised by gradual nerve damage brought on by oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and prolonged hyperglycemia. Studies identify NLRP3 inflammasome as a key mediator in the pathogenesis of DPN, connecting neuroinflammation and neuronal damage to metabolic failure. Because of their strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities, flavonoids, a broad class of naturally occurring polyphenols, have drawn interest as potential treatments for DPN. The various ways that flavonoids affect the NLRP3 inflammasome and their potential as a treatment for DPN are examined in this review. It has been demonstrated that flavonoids prevent NLRP3 activation, which lowers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-18 and causes neuroinflammation. Flavonoids work mechanistically by reducing oxidative stress, altering important signalling pathways, and blocking the activities of NF-κB and caspase-1, which are both essential for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Preclinical research has shown that flavonoids have strong neuroprotective benefits, and few clinical evidence also points to the potential of flavonoids to improve nerve function and lessen neuropathic pain in diabetic patients. The current review emphasises how flavonoids may be used as a treatment strategy to target inflammation in DPN caused by the NLRP3 inflammasome. By targeting important inflammatory pathways, flavonoids provide a new way to slow the progression of this debilitating illness. Further investigation into the mechanisms, clinical translation, and novel drug delivery techniques could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of diabetic peripheral neuropathy."

      "abstract": "The rich biodiversity of Indonesia provides a wide variety of plants rich in flavonoids, which show promising potential as antidiabetic agents. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds recognized for their broad biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effects. Traditional Indonesian medicinal plants such as Syzygium cumini, Moringa oleifera, and Curcuma longa are currently being studied for their flavonoid content and potential in diabetes treatment. Studies suggest that flavonoids can influence crucial pathways in diabetes management, including enhancing insulin sensitivity, boosting insulin production, and safeguarding pancreatic β cells against damage caused by oxidative stress. For example, quercetin and kaempferol, flavonoids in many Indonesian plants, have demonstrated potential for managing glucose metabolism and lowering high blood sugar levels. Additionally, these substances have been shown to inhibit enzymes such as α-glucosidase and α-amylase, which are involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates, thus aiding in the regulation of blood sugar levels after meals. The antioxidant qualities of flavonoids play a crucial role in fighting oxidative stress and are a significant contributor to the development of diabetes and related complications. Flavonoids help neutralize free radicals and enhance the body's antioxidant protection, reducing oxidative harm and promoting metabolic wellness. Additionally, their anti-inflammatory properties aid in reducing the chronic inflammation linked to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Formulation advancements, such as nanocarrier technology, have been explored to boost the effectiveness of flavonoid-based therapies. Due to its vast plant diversity, Indonesia offers a potential reservoir for new antidiabetic drugs, meriting additional research and development with the aim of this review providing new knowledge on the potential of flavonoids that can play a role in the treatment of diabetes."

In this study, the ability of Z. bungeanum residue extract to control algal blooms has been firstly verified. Then, the response surface methodology was employed to optimize flavonoids yield, the primary antimicrobial component in extract, and the underlying photosynthetic inhibition mechanisms of extract on Tetrodesmus obliquus was investigated. Results showed that the highest yield of total flavonoids was increased to 4.08% when the extraction conditions were a liquid-to-solid ratio of 10:1, ethanol concentration of 60%, extraction temperature of 80°C, and extraction time of 30 min. Meanwhile, treatment with Z. bungeanum residue extract at doses of 40.0 mg/L significantly decreased the Fv/Fm and PIabs values of T. obliquus by 24.36 and 88.87% at 50 h, respectively. The added extract induced damage at multiple levels of physiological and biochemical processes in algal cells, including reduced electron transport capability, disrupted energy transfer in photosystem II, disruption of OEC structure, and altered energy distribution in PSII reaction center. To our knowledge, this study was the first verification of Z. bungeanum residue's algicidal potential, and these findings in our study contribute to a deeper understanding of the allelopathic mechanisms of Z. bungeanum residue extract and offer valuable insights for the management of algal blooms."

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious neurological disease with an extremely high disability rate. Most patients show a loss of motor and sensory functions below the level of injury. Current treatment protocols are based on early surgical decompression and pharmacotherapy. However, the efficacy of these interventions is suboptimal. Due to its complex pathophysiological mechanisms and the difficulty of central nervous system (CNS) regeneration, exploring effective therapeutic interventions remains daunting. Flavonoids are secondary metabolites unique to plants that have attracted attention in recent years for their potential efficacy and are now commonly used in the treatment of inflammation, tumors, and other diseases. For SCI, related studies are still exploring; some compounds, such as quercetin, fisetin, and hesperetin, have shown good anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, which help to restore the function of the injured spinal cord. However, flavonoids exhibit certain disadvantages, including poor solubility, low bioavailability, and the inability to achieve long-term controlled release. Some studies have proposed potential drug delivery strategies-including nanoparticles, hydrogels, and collagen scaffolds-to enhance efficacy. In this paper, we summarize the therapeutic mechanisms and drug delivery strategies of flavonoids in SCI by searching the relevant literature in recent years and propose future research directions to provide new ideas for the multimodal treatment of SCI."

      "abstract": "Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that predominantly causes inflammation and impacts peripheral joints. Even though immunosuppressive and NSAIDs or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines are implemented for the management of this disorder, sbut they carry some severe side effects along with them. Therefore, society requires treatment with fewer side effects and powerful anti-arthritic properties, such as flavonoids. These are the most prevalent phenolic compounds found in nature that have potent antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activity and there are several bioactive flavonoids that carry potent anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, only a handful has reached their clinical use. Still, in both clinical and preclinical models of arthritis, flavonoids found in the diet have been shown to reduce swelling in joints and arthritis symptoms. There are only a few scientific studies regarding their mechanisms of action in arthritis. However, the arthritic potential of dietary flavonoids is insufficient because of their limited solubility, absorption, and fast metabolism. Nanocarriers may enhance the bioavailability of flavonoids. This review examines the therapeutic effects of the most prevalent and abundant flavonoid groups on arthritis. Specifically, the modes of action of the most important flavonoids on the chemical messengers in the body that contribute to the signalling of joint inflammation-related indicators of arthritis are discussed in more detail."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are important drivers in the pathogenesis and progression of many chronic diseases, such as cancers of the breast, kidney, lung, and others, autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, atherosclerosis, arrhythmia), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease), mental disorders (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), gastrointestinal disorders (inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer), and other disorders. With the increasing demand for less toxic and more tolerable therapies, flavonoids have the potential to effectively modulate the responsiveness to conventional therapy and radiotherapy. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and plant-derived beverages. Six of the twelve structurally different flavonoid subgroups are of dietary significance and include anthocyanidins (e.g. pelargonidin, cyanidin), flavan-3-ols (e.g. epicatechin, epigallocatechin), flavonols (e.g. quercetin, kaempferol), flavones (e.g. luteolin, baicalein), flavanones (e.g. hesperetin, naringenin), and isoflavones (daidzein, genistein). The health benefits of flavonoids are related to their structural characteristics, such as the number and position of hydroxyl groups and the presence of C2C3 double bonds, which predetermine their ability to chelate metal ions, terminate ROS (e.g. hydroxyl radicals formed by the Fenton reaction), and interact with biological targets to trigger a biological response. Based on these structural characteristics, flavonoids can exert both antioxidant or prooxidant properties, modulate the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes and the expression and activation of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)), induce apoptosis and autophagy, and target key signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Bcl-2 family of proteins. This review aims to briefly discuss the mutually interconnected aspects of oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms, such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, DNA damage, and the mechanism and resolution of inflammation. The major part of this article discusses the role of flavonoids in alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation, two common components of many human diseases.

Flavonoids not only have antidepressant effects, but can also promote the synthesis and utilization of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), which are closely associated with depression. This study aimed to explore the association between flavonoid intake and the risk of perimenopausal depression and the mediating role of HDL-c. METHODS: The data of this study were collected from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) continuously from 2005 to 2018, and flavonoid intakes data were extracted from the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the association between flavonoid intake and the risk of perimenopausal depression, and the mediating effect model was constructed to explore the impact of HDL-c on the correlation. RESULTS: Total 4603 perimenopausal female participants were included in this study, results showed that flavonoid intake was inversely associated with the risk of perimenopausal depression, and positively associated with serum HDL-c levels. These associations persisted after adjustment for relevant covariates. Serum HDL-c mediated the association between flavonoid intake and the risk of perimenopausal depression. LIMITATIONS: As a cross-sectional study, which cannot determine the causal relationship between flavonoid intake and perimenopausal depression. CONCLUSION: Our research showed that flavonoid intake, perimenopausal depression, and serum HDL-c are pairwise correlated, revealing that higher flavonoid intake was associated with a lower risk of perimenopausal depression, which may be mediated in part by serum HDL-c.",

Amomum tsaoko Crevost et Lemarie is a kind of medicinal and food herb that is rich in flavonoids. However, the pharmacological effects of Amomum tsaoko flavonoids (ATF) on UC have not yet been reported. The present study established a mouse model of UC using 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), and modern molecular biology techniques such as IHC, RT-qPCR, Western blot, and 16S rRNA gene analysis were used to investigate the effect of ATF in UC mice. The results demonstrated that a high dose of ATF (100 mg/kg) led to a significant restoration of body weight, disease activity index score, and colon length, in addition to ameliorating colonic tissue damage in UC mice. ATF reduced the serum levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), inhibited the activation of the colonic TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway, and increased the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin4. Furthermore, ATF was found to reduce the relative abundance of the DSS-induced conditional pathogenic (Escherichia-Shigella, Colidextribacter, and Oscillibacter), increase the potential probiotic taxa (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and unclassified_f__Atopobiaceae). Interestingly, these genera were found to be significantly correlated with the UC core phenotypic indicators. These findings indicated that ATF may alleviate UC symptoms by modulating the gut microbiota-LPS/TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 axis. The present study has the potential to serve as a valuable reference point for understanding the role of natural flavonoids in the prevention of inflammatory diseases, and to expand the future applications of ATF in the fields of food and medicine."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Cancer, particularly lung, liver, and other malignancies, remains a major global health challenge due to their high incidence, complex etiology, and resistance to conventional therapies. Flavonoids derived from Sophora flavescens (Kushen) have gained attention for their potential in cancer prevention and treatment. This study uses network pharmacology, based on Traditional Chinese Medicine's holistic approach, and molecular simulation techniques to explore the anticancer mechanisms of Sophora flavescens flavonoids, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for developing plant-based anticancer agents. Active compounds and their targets were identified through literature screening and target identification methods. A cancer-related protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify key therapeutic targets, helping to understand how these flavonoids exert multitarget anticancer effects. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses elucidated mechanisms related to cancer cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and signaling pathway regulation. Network pharmacology analysis identified TP53, ESR1, SRC, AKT1, and MAPK1 as key anticancer targets, involved in essential biological processes like phosphorylation and protein kinase activity. KEGG analysis showed that these flavonoids modulate critical pathways, particularly PI3K-Akt and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK. Molecular docking revealed that rutin and luteolin-7-O-gentiobioside strongly bind to MAPK1, with interaction energies of 77.1466 kcal/mol and 79.2011 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating promising anticancer effects. Additionally, compounds with different substitution positions, such as those with glycosylation at the 7-OH position or isoprenyl groups at the C-8 positions, exhibited significantly higher interaction energies. Non-covalent interaction analysis further clarified how these flavonoids enhance anticancer effects through stable binding, with hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts stabilizing interactions with MAPK1. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed the stability of these interactions, and binding free energy calculations revealed that luteolin-7-O-gentiobioside and rutin exhibited the lowest binding free energies (- 153.7841 kcal/mol and - 132.7434 kcal/mol, respectively), significantly outperforming the original ligand (- 57.7209 kcal/mol), further supporting the therapeutic potential of these compounds. To complement these findings, in silico ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) predictions were employed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of rutin and luteolin-7-O-gentiobioside. The systematic analysis revealed critical issues in solubility, blood-brain barrier penetration, and hepatotoxicity, providing strategic guidance for structural optimization and formulation design. This study provides valuable insights into the multitarget anticancer mechanisms of Sophora flavescens flavonoids and supports their potential as plant-derived anticancer agents. However, further experimental and clinical studies, especially integrating TCM practice, are needed to validate these findings.

Recent studies suggest a novel intersection between flavonoids and miRNAs, where flavonoids may modulate the expression of specific miRNAs implicated in CVD pathogenesis. This review explores the potential of flavonoids as miRNA modulators, focusing on their ability to regulate miRNAs associated with cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and vascular inflammation. By bridging the therapeutic potential of flavonoids with miRNA targeting, this review highlights innovative pathways for advancing CVD treatment strategies. Additionally, preclinical and clinical evidence supporting these interactions is discussed, alongside the challenges and opportunities in developing flavonoid-based miRNA therapies. Unlocking this synergy could pave the way for more effective, personalized approaches to CVD management, addressing unmet needs in contemporary cardiovascular care."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a widely studied pathophysiological foundation of cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation and dyslipidemia are risk factors that promote the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The gut microbiota and their metabolites are considered independent risk factors for atherosclerosis. Polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids, as the extracts of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. and Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge, have shown excellent cardiovascular protective effects. However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Our study aimed to explore the anti-atherosclerotic mechanism through gut microbiota and their metabolites. METHODS: ApoE-/- mice were fed either a normal-chow diet or a high-fat diet. The polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids group received varied doses of polydatin and hawthorn flavonoids: a high dose (polydatin 200 mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 100 mg/kg daily), a medium dose (polydatin 100 mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 50 mg/kg daily), and a low dose (polydatin 50 mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 25 mg/kg daily). The control and model groups were administered distilled water (0.2 mL daily). The experiment lasted for 24 weeks. RESULTS: Polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids administration significantly reduced lipid and inflammatory cytokine levels, meanwhile, the atherosclerotic lesions in a high-fat diet-induced ApoE-/- mice were significantly decreased. Additionally, polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids also inhibited the enhancement of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), trimethylamine (TMA) levels of HFD-induced ApoE-/- mice by regulating the expression of hepatic flavin-containing enzyme monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). 16S rRNA sequencing results demonstrated that high-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids treatment increased the abundance of Actinobacteriota, Atopobiaceae and Coriobacteriaea_UCG-002, and decreased the abundance of Desulfobacterota. Norank_f_Muribaculaceae was enriched in the medium-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids and simvastatin groups, and Lactobacillus was mainly increased in the simvastatin and the low-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids groups. According to the metagenetic results, functional annotations also suggested that the biological processes of each group mainly focused on metabolism-related processes. Specifically, polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids may regulate the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria (Coriobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrio, Muribaculum, and Clostridium) and related enzymes in glycolipid metabolic pathways to exert an important effect on the prevention of atherosclerosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids could regulate the glucolipid metabolism-related pathway, attenuate inflammatory cytokine levels, and reduce atherosclerotic plaques by remodeling gut microbiota."

Using a bioactivity-guided approach, three phenylpropanoid derivatives - ferulic acid (1), isoeugenol (2) and homovanillyl alcohol (3) - and three flavonoids - luteolin (4), velutin (5) and 3-O-methylquercetin (6) - were isolated. With respect to anti-T. cruzi potential, all isolated compounds, except ferulic acid (1), showed activity against trypomastigotes. Homovanillyl alcohol (3) was the most active metabolite (EC50 = 6.3 µg/mL), showing similar activity to benznidazole used as a positive control. In addition, none of the compounds tested showed toxicity against murine fibroblasts (CC50 > 200 µg/mL). The results therefore suggest that homovanillyl alcohol (3), a structurally simple C6C2 natural product, may be used as a prototype in future drug discovery studies for the treatment of Chagas disease."

      "abstract": "Periodontal disease, prevalent in 20% to 50% of the population, is a chronic multifactorial inflammation caused by a dysbiotic oral biofilm, with gingivitis and periodontitis being the most common forms. Flavonoids, such as myricetin and catechin, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, reducing nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. This study compared the effects of different flavonoids on viability and oxidative response of LPS-stimulated macrophages. RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured at a density of 1-5 × 105 cells for 24 h. Cells were treated with flavonoids epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), taxifolin, myricetin, pinocembrin, and kaempferol (200 to 6.25 µM) for 2 h, and evaluated for cytotoxicity, using resazurin assays. Additionally, cells were treated with flavonoids (50, 25, and 12.5 µM) for 2 h, followed by exposure to LPS (100 ng/mL or 1 µg/mL) for 72 h, and cytotoxicity determined. NO and ROS levels were quantified after 2 h of flavonoid treatment, followed by LPS exposure (1 µg/mL), compared to control dexamethasone (DEX). LPS at 1 μg/mL significantly reduced cell viability (75.26%) and in its presence, taxifolin, myricetin, and kaempferol stimulated cell metabolic activity. All flavonoids, regardless of concentration, reduced NO levels when cells were treated with LPS. The flavonoids also reduced ROS levels, with EGCG and myricetin at 50 and 12.5 μM and kaempferol at 50 μM reducing levels to below those of the untreated control, as observed for DEX. The flavonoids, particularly EGCG, taxifolin, myricetin, and kaempferol, at the concentrations tested, stimulated macrophage metabolism, and reduced NO and ROS concentrations in the presence of LPS."

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of quercetin's effects on pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT, which are central to cancer cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. Through inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signaling, quercetin promotes apoptosis and reduces proliferation specifically in cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. Additionally, quercetin downregulates NF-κB activity and modulates JAK/STAT signaling, enhancing immune recognition of cancer cells and decreasing inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Emerging nanoformulation strategies are also discussed, highlighting how nanotechnology can improve quercetin's bioavailability and targeting capabilities. Unlike other reviews, this work uniquely integrates molecular insights with cutting-edge nanoformulations, showcasing quercetin's dual potential as a therapeutic agent and an immune modulator in the evolving landscape of cancer treatment. This review underscores quercetin's multifaceted role in cancer treatment and suggests future directions to optimize its clinical efficacy, particularly in combination with conventional therapies."

This study investigates the specific compounds of TFPF responsible for TNF-α inhibition and delineates their mechanism of action. METHODS: L929 cells and luciferase-based assays were used to assess anti-TNF-α activity. Additionally, MH7A cells and Wistar rats were employed to establish in vitro and in vivo models of RA. Chemical chromatography, thermal proteome profiling (TPP), molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), drug affinity responsive target stability tests (DARTS), and transcriptomic analysis were used to study the potent molecules of TFPF and their protein targets and pathways. H&E staining, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA, and Western blot were employed for pharmacodynamic and mechanism studies of these potent molecules. RESULTS: TFPF mitigated cellular injury in L929 cells and inhibited luciferase expression, both of which were induced by TNF-α. Among the eight compounds identified, quercetin exhibited the most potent anti-TNF-α activity. Quercetin improved cellular injury and reduced the cell apoptosis rate in L929 cells treated with TNF-α. TPP revealed the interaction between quercetin and TNF-α, which was verified by molecular docking, SPR, CETSA, and DARTS assays. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted the TNF signaling pathway, suggesting that quercetin may target TNF-α to inhibit the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Quercetin inhibited luciferase expression, suppressed the phosphorylation of IκBα and p65, blocked p65 nuclear translocation, and reduced the mRNA expression of COX-2, INOS, IL-6, and IL-1β. Moreover, quercetin decreased inflammation and joint damage in RA. CONCLUSION: Quercetin, a compound of TFPF, interacts with and inhibits the activity of TNF-α, thereby suppressing the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway and alleviating the symptoms of RA. These findings position quercetin as a promising TNF-α inhibitor for the treatment of RA."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world, while non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80% of all lung cancers. Most patients with NSCLC have advanced stage disease at diagnosis, and the 5-year survival rate can be discouragingly low. Flavonoids are widely found in fruits, vegetables, teas, and medicinal plants, with a variety of functional effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. This review aims to focus on the research progress of flavonoids in the treatment of NSCLC, including immunomodulatory effects on NSCLC, promotion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, interaction with microRNA (miRNA), and interactions with certain proteins. In addition, combining flavonoids and anticancer agents, radiotherapy, or nanoparticles can reverse NSCLC  drug resistance, inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. It therefore appears that flavonoids alone or in combination with other treatment agents may be a promising therapeutic modality for treating NSCLC, with great potential in mass production and clinical applications."

In the present study, 107.37 mg g-1 alcoholic extract of total flavonoids was used for the determination of in vitro antioxidant activity by UV spectrophotometric method; the ALI model mice were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the organ index of mice, the wet-to-dry ratio of lungs, and the histopathological sections of lungs were measured; the levels of inflammatory factors (interleukin-1β [IL-1β], TL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) were determined in serum and alveolar lavage fluid of mice by ELISA; the composition of AMF total flavonoids and the migratory components of blood were analyzed on the basis of UHPLC-MS/MS. We analyzed the composition of AMF total flavonoids and the migratory components in blood based on UHPLC-MS/MS technology as well as analyzed the active compounds, targets and mechanism of action of AMF total flavonoids in the treatment of ALI through serum medicinal chemistry combined with network pharmacology. The in vitro antioxidant combined with in vivo anti-inflammatory assays showed that AMF total flavonoids exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of ALI. A total of 31 flavonoids were identified by UHPLC-MS/MS, and 21 compounds were identified from the serum samples of mice after the administration of AMF total flavonoids, including 11 prototypical compositions and 10 metabolites; 11 blood-migratory prototypical compositions and relevant targets for ALI were collected by network pharmacology. Finally, 77 intersecting targets were obtained, including AKT1, interleukin-6 [IL-6], TNF, EGFR, and IL-1β. These overlapping targets mainly corresponded to quercetin, 5-hydroxy-3,3',4',6,7,8-hexamethoxyflavone, and kaempferol, which regulate inflammatory responses through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The mechanism of action of total flavonoids from AMF fruits for the treatment of ALI provided a new way to utilize AMF as a new food resource and new ideas for the research of new drugs for the prevention and treatment of ALI."

Therefore, the present review investigated the molecular mechanisms of flavonoids in the treatment of different types of GI cancer and summarized the drug delivery systems commonly used to improve their bioavailability. First, the classification of flavonoids and the therapeutic effects of various flavonoids on human diseases were briefly introduced. Then, to clarify the mechanism of action of flavonoids on different types of GI cancer in the human body, the metabolic process of flavonoids in the human body and the associated signaling pathways causing five common types of GI cancer were discussed, as well as the corresponding therapeutic targets of flavonoids. Finally, in clinical settings, flavonoids have poor water solubility, low permeability and inferior stability, which lead to low absorption efficiency in vivo.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increased prevalence of hyperlipidemia significantly affects human health worldwide. Although drug treatment is very effective, the harm to the human body cannot be ignored. Improvement of lipid metabolism by natural medicinal and food homologous products is an effective approach to ameliorate hyperlipidemia and it has gradually become a research focus. In this research, we adopted HepG2 cell models and high-fat-diet-fed C57BL/6j mouse models to explore the effect of hawthorn total flavonoids (HTF) on hyperlipidemia. Moreover, we utilized western blot and gut microbiota analysis to elucidate the specific mechanism of HTF's influence on hyperlipidemia. RESULTS: We found that HTF significantly alleviated hyperlipidemia and its complications, as manifested by reduced body weight gain and fat accumulation, and improved the disorder of intestinal microorganisms. HTF protected the liver, reducing aspartate transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and ameliorating inflammatory infiltration. Fat droplet amounts and necrotic cell numbers in liver cells were also decreased. Mechanistically, HTF promoted AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, inhibited sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c expression, downregulating the expression of lipid synthesis-related proteins (acetyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), thus suppressing liver lipid synthesis. HTF also functioned as a natural peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) agonist. Activated PPARα enhanced mitochondrial oxidation and lipid consumption via upregulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator expression was also elevated, activating mitochondrial activity, increasing cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity and cholesterol consumption, and reducing blood lipids. Additionally, HTF regulated intestinal flora abundance, restored the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, balanced gut-liver axis crosstalk, and alleviated hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that HTF alleviated the pathological symptoms caused by hyperlipidemia, and had a certain protective effect on the liver. HTF also stimulated the lipid metabolism pathway and accelerated lipid consumption. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "Eczema is a complex autoimmune condition characterised mainly by inflammation and skin lesions along with physical and psychological comorbidities. Although there have been significant advances in understanding the mechanisms behind atopic dermatitis, conventionally available treatments yield inconsistent results and have some unintended consequences. In today's digital age, where knowledge is just a click away, natural-based supplements have been on the rise for a more \"natural\" treatment towards any type of disease. Natural compounds, particularly derived from medicinal plants, have piqued significant interest in the development of herbal remedies for chronic inflammatory skin conditions. Among many compounds, flavonoids have shown promise in treating eczema due to their strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-allergic properties, making them helpful in preventing allergic reactions, inflammation, and skin irritation. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of flavonoid-based bioactive compounds to manage eczema, emphasising the mechanisms of action. Additionally, providing a comprehensive analysis of the potential of emerging and established compounds, while bridging a gap between traditional and modern medicine. Flavonoids offer a variety of opportunities for further research and innovative formulations that can maximise its full benefits. Further combination of flavonoids with various approaches such as nanoencapsulation for enhanced bioavailability, hydrogel-based delivery systems for a controlled release, and additive manufacturing for personalised topical formulations, could align with future precision medicine needs."

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents one of the most serious health issues and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. However, the treatment options for CRC are associated with adverse reactions, and in some cases, resistance can develop. Flavonoids have emerged as promising alternatives for CRC prevention and therapy due to their multitude of biological properties and ability to target distinct processes involved in CRC pathogenesis. Their innate disadvantageous properties (e.g., low solubility and stability, reduced bioavailability, and lack of tumor specificity) have delayed the potential inclusion of flavonoids in CRC treatment regimens but have hastened the design of nanopharmaceuticals comprising a flavonoid agent entrapped in a nanosized delivery platform that not only counteract these inconveniences but also provide an augmented therapeutic effect and an elevated safety profile by conferring a targeted action. Starting with a brief presentation of the pathological features of CRC and an overview of flavonoid classes, the present study comprehensively reviews the anti-CRC activity of different flavonoids from a mechanistic perspective while also portraying the latest discoveries made in the area of flavonoid-containing nanocarriers that have proved efficient in CRC management. This review concludes by showcasing future perspectives for the advancement of flavonoids and flavonoid-based nanopharmaceuticals in CRC research."

      "abstract": "This study conducted a literature review by searching for articles related to the treatment of skin infections/wrinkles using nano-delivery systems containing natural compounds. The search was conducted in various databases for articles published in the last 10 years, with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the 490 articles found, 40 were considered relevant. Acne vulgaris is a common dermatological disorder characterised by inflammation of the sebaceous glands, often resulting in the development of pimples, cysts, and scarring. Conventional treatments, including antibiotics and topical retinoids, frequently demonstrate limitations such as side effects, resistance, and insufficient skin absorption. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have enabled the creation of innovative drug-delivery systems that enhance the effectiveness and reduce the adverse effects of anti-acne medications. Polyphenols and flavonoids, natural bioactive compounds with notable anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, are recognised for their therapeutic effectiveness in acne treatment. However, their practical application is hindered by insufficient solubility, stability, and bioavailability. The incorporation of these compounds into nanoparticle-based delivery systems has shown promise in resolving these challenges. Various nanoparticle platforms, including lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles, are evaluated for their ability to improve the stability, controlled release, and targeted delivery of polyphenols and flavonoids to the skin. The advent of polyphenol and flavonoid-loaded nanoparticles marks a new acne therapy era."

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, but the existing therapeutic drugs for PD have limitations; thus, there is an urgent need to discover new methods of prevention and treatment. Amomum tsaoko Crevost et Lemarie (AT) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine and food. Its main pharmacological effect is the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract. To date, no studies on the use of AT or its extracts to treat PD have been reported. In this study, a rotenone-induced PD mouse model was utilized to evaluate the protective effect of Amomum tsaoko flavonoids (ATFs) and to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in this effect. The results demonstrated that ATFs not only ameliorated the motor and constipation symptoms but also reduced the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, ATFs reduced the expression of inflammation-related genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, and MCP-1) and increased the expression of gut barrier-related genes (Muc-2, ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin3, and Claudin4) in the colon. Notably, ATFs were able to reverse rotenone-induced gut dysbiosis, including a significant decrease in the abundance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria (Desulfovibrio, Provotellaceae UCG-001, the Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, norank_f_Erysipelotrichacea, and the Eubacterium nodatum group) and an increase in the abundance of probiotics (Bifidobacterium and Faecalibaculum). Interestingly, these genera were found to be significantly associated with PD motor symptoms and constipation indicators. This suggests that ATFs have the potential to alleviate PD symptoms through the modulation of gut microbes. These findings provide a solid foundation for further investigations into the anti-PD mechanism of ATFs and their potential in the prevention and treatment of PD.",

Inhibiting nerve cells death and enhancing the repair of ischemic tissue are important treatment concepts for IS. Currently, the mainstream treatment strategies mainly focus on short-term care, which underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies for long-term care. Emerging data reveal that flavonoids have surfaced as promising candidates for IS patients' long-term care. Flavonoids can alleviate neuroinflammation and anti-apoptosis due to their characteristic pharmacological mechanisms. Clinical evidence suggests that long-term flavonoids intake improves IS patients' long-term outcomes. Though the effect of flavonoids in IS treatment has been explored for decades, the neuroprotective pharmacodynamics have not been well established. Thereby, the aim of current review is to summarize the pathways involved in neuroprotective effect of flavonoids. This review will also advance the potential of flavonoids as a viable clinical candidate for the treatment of IS.",

Nonetheless, our understanding of how different types of exudates influence the abundance of potential pathogens in soil remains insufficient. Investigating the effects of root exudates on soil-dwelling pathogenic fungi is imperative for a comprehensive understanding of plant-fungal interactions within soil ecosystems and for maintaining soil health. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of the principal components of root exudates-flavonoids (FLA), phenolic acids (PA), and organic acids (OA)-on soil microbial communities and soil properties, as well as to investigate their mechanisms of action on soil potential pathogenic fungi. The results demonstrated that the addition of these components significantly modified the composition and diversity of soil microbial communities, with OA treatment notably altering the composition of dominant microbial taxa. Furthermore, the introduction of these substances facilitated the proliferation of saprophytic fungi. Additionally, the incorporation of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and organic acids led to an increased abundance of potential pathogenic fungi in the soil, particularly in the FLA and PA treatments. It was observed that the addition of these substances enhanced soil fertility, pH, and antioxidant enzyme activity. Specifically, FLA and PA treatments reduced the abundance of dominant microbial taxa, whereas OA treatment altered the composition of these taxa. These findings suggest that the inclusion of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and organic acids could potentially augment the enrichment of soil potential pathogenic fungi by modulating soil properties and enzymatic activities. These results offer valuable insights into the interactions between plants and fungal communities in soil ecosystems and provide a scientific foundation for the management and maintenance of soil health."

Modern pharmacological research has proved that E. ulmoides could prohibit the occurrence of osteoporosis and arthritis. AIM: To investigate the effect and action mechanism of total flavonoids isolated from the leaves of E. ulmoides (TFEL) on bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats, and to study its effect on intestinal flora. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3-month-old female rats were randomly divided into six groups: sham operation group, OVX model group, estradiol group, TFEL low (TFEL-L) (50), mid (-M) (100) and high (-H) (200 mg/kg/d) dose groups. After 13 weeks of treatment, the rats were sacrificed to measure bone turnover markers, related tissue biochemical indices, microstructure parameters, and osteoclastogenesis promotor RANKL and inhibitor OPG expression levels. Additionally, fecal samples were obtained for high-throughput sequencing to analyze the intestinal flora. RESULTS: Oral administration of TFEL for 13 weeks increased the serum level of bone formation marker PINP and decreased the level of bone resorption marker NTX-I. The femoral microstructure parameters of the TFEL-M and TFEL-H groups were significantly improved compared with the OVX group, which were also confirmed by H&E histological staining. High-throughput sequencing indicated that TFEL may regulate the composition of intestinal flora and intestinal microecology. CONCLUSION: TFEL can prevent osteoporosis in OVX rats and has no toxic side effects. Meanwhile, TFEL can increase the diversity and improve the composition of intestinal flora in OVX rats."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUD: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent chronic autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, resulting in pain and swelling in the synovial joints. Flemingia philippinensis, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to be an effective treatment approach for anti-rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which still needs further research in its active ingredient and regulatory mechanisms. PURPOSE: This study aimed at investigate the pharmacodynamic basis and intricate mechanism of action of Flemingia philippinensis (FPTF) in the treatment of RA based on integrated omics technologies. METHODS: UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS was first established to identify the active components of FPTF in blood and network pharmacology was then used to predict the key therapeutic targets and corresponding pathways of FPTF in treatment of RA. To substantiate the pharmacodynamic effects, a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) animal model was employed to observe the anti-RA effects of FPTF through a series of indicators, including rat body weight, arthritis scoring, paw swelling, histopathological analysis of synovial tissue, and serum inflammatory factors. Subsequently, the potential mechanisms underlying the anti-RA efficacy of FPTF was elucidated by integrating metabolomics analysis with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Specifically, the RT-qPCR experiment was further conducted to validate the pathways predicted by serum pharmacochemistry, network pharmacology, metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 10 compounds derived from FPTF were identified by serum sample analysis. Utilizing network pharmacology, we identified 117 common targets for FPTF in the treatment of RA. Notably, KEGG analysis highlighted the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the IL17 signaling pathway as key pathways associated with the anti-RA effects of FPTF. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that FPTF can significantly alleviate CIA-induced arthritis. Compared with the CIA model group, FPTF treatment significantly improved the expression of mRNA in the PI3K/AKT and IL-17 signaling pathways. Further investigation unveiled a total of 28 differential metabolites in serum samples, among which 21 metabolites were observed to be reversed following FPTF administration. Metabolomic profiling revealed pronounced perturbations in amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways in CIA rats, which were partially rectified by FPTF treatment. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis indicated that FPTF could restore the gut microbiota balance disrupted by RA. RT-qPCR further confirmed that FPTF can modulate key enzymes in metabolic pathway analysis and gut microbiota metabolic pathways. CONCLUSION: This study pioneeringly elucidates the potential pharmacodynamic material basis of FPTF for treatment of RA, detailing the regulated metabolic pathways and key gut microbiota genera involved. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying the effects of FPTF in RA treatment.",

      "abstract": "To valorize sour jujube (Ziziphus acidojujuba) leaves, this work focused on the extraction, quantification, and bioactivity assessment of flavonoids. First, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was employed to extract total flavonoids from sour jujube leaves (SJL-TF), with the procedure optimized through single-factor design and response surface methodology (RSM). SJL-TF yield reached 48.47 ± 0.36 mg/g under optimal circumstances, which included 61 % ethanol as extraction medium, an ultrasound power of 300 W, an extraction time of 33 min, and a liquid-solid ratio of 16 mL/g, showing higher extraction efficiency in comparison to the traditional Soxhlet extraction method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that ultrasound treatment severely damaged the structural integrity of sour jujube leaves, which was more conducive to improving the SJL-TF yield. Then, polyamide resin chromatography was used to purify the crude SJL-TF extracts, increasing the SJL-TF purity by 3.2-fold to 74.58 ± 0.63 %. By developing and validating a UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS method, ten main flavonoids in SJL-TF extracts, including catechin, rutin, isoquercetin, narirutin, nicotiflorin, quercitrin, phlorizin, luteolin, quercetin, and apigenin, were successfully detected concurrently for quality control purposes. Furthermore, the purified SJL-TF showed a strong ameliorative effect on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice, as evidenced by significant mitigation of colonic inflammation and pathological damage. Thus, this work will contribute to improving the application of sour jujube leaves, especially in the pharmaceutical sector.",

In the present study, we investigated the effects of four Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt. extracts, including luteolin, marein, naringenin (NGN) and chlorogenic acid (CQA), on lipid accumulation and oxidative stress induced by oleic acid (OA) in HepG2 cells. METHODS: Oleic acid was employed to create a high-lipid milieu in a cellular setting in vitro using HepG2 cells. After treatment by luteolin, marein, NGN, and CQA, cell counting kit-8 assay was used for measuring cell viability. Lipid accumulation, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress were examined by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Oil red O staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacetate assays. Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were applied to determine the expression of genes and proteins, respectively. RESULTS: In OA-treated HepG2 cells, the administration of the four active flavonoids of Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt. (luteolin, marein, NGN and CQA) enhanced cell viability (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01); reduced lactate dehydrogenase releasing, lipid deposition and production of triglyceride, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01); and elevated high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol production (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 or p < 0.001). Moreover, after luteolin, marein, NGN or CQA treatment, the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) was downregulated (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001) but the expression of cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1) was upregulated (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 or p < 0.001) in OA-treated HepG2 cells. Similarly, luteolin, marein, NGN or CQA treatment greatly enhanced the anti-oxidant activities (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 or p < 0.001) and decreased reactive oxygen species production (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001) in OA-treated HepG2 cells. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein, a major transcription factor that moderates the biosynthesis of fatty acid, cholesterol and triglyceride, was also inhibited after luteolin, marein, NGN or CQA treatment (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 or p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that luteolin, marein, NGN or CQA can effectively reduce OA-induced oxidative stress and lipid accumulation, corroborating their potential in hyperlipidemia treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The normal butanol fraction of Polygonum hydropiper L. flavonoids (FNB) exhibits significant anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigated FNB's impact on inflammatory responses induced by Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in cell and mouse models. METHODS: An inflammatory model was established in RAW264.7 cells infected with varying PCV2 concentrations. And assigning both RAW264.7 cells and 108 SPF-grade KM mice to Control, PCV2, Rutin, and various dosages of FNB groups. Inflammatory factors such as Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and Nitric Oxide (NO) were quantified using ELISA, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Results showed that a PCV2 titer of 104.5 TCID50/0.1 mL when applied to RAW264.7 cells effectively established an in vitro inflammatory model at 12 and 24 h post-infection. Following PCV2 infection, all the inflammatory factors displayed a significant increased both in culture supernatant and intracellular mRNA expression levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), but these levels were reduced by FNB treatment (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). In mouse sera post-PCV2 infection also showed elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8 IL-10, TNF-α, and MCP-1 (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Additionally, mRNA and protein levels for TNF-α, IL-8, IL-10, IL-6, and iNOS rose significantly in lung tissues (p < 0.01) but decreased with FNB treatment (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that FNB reduces inflammatory factor production and modulates the inflammatory response triggered by PCV2 infection, potentially enhancing host resistance against it."

      "abstract": "TFRD has been widely used in China to treat osteoporosis (OP). However, the specific molecular mechanism of TFRD against OP has not been fully clarified. Our previous studies have also proved that TFRD could attenuate OP and the clinical equivalent dose of 67.5mg/kg/d is the effective dose for TFRD treating OP. Therefore, this study used 67.5mg/kg as the dosage of TFRD in combination with multi omics to investigate the mechanism of action of TFRD in the treatment of OP. The aim of this study was to further elucidate molecular mechanism of TFRD for treating OP based on metagenomic and metabolomic analyses. In this study, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, micro computed tomography (micro-CT) and bone mineral density (BMD) analysis were used to observe pharmacological effects of TFRD against ovariectomized (OVX)-induced OP. Subsequently, multiomics analysis including metagenomics, untargeted and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) metabolomics were carried out to identify whether the anti-osteoporosis mechanism of TFRD correlated with gut microbiota and related metabolites. Our results indicate that TFRD could improve the microstructure and density of trabecular bone in OVX rats. 17 differential species, which mainly from Akkermansia, Bacteroides, and Phascolarctobacterium genus, 14 related differential metabolites and acetic acid in SCFAs were significantly altered by OVX and reversed by TFRD. Furthermore, according to results of untargeted metabolomics analysis, it was found that several metabolic pathways such as phenylalanine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and so on might play an important role in TFRD against OP. In order to further study the relationship between gut microbiota and related metabolites, spearman correlation analysis was used, and showed that gut microbiota such as Akkermansia muciniphila might be closely related to several metabolites and metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that TFRD treatment could reduce the effects of OVX-induced OP by altering community composition and abundance of gut microbiota, regulating metabolites and SCFAs. It was speculated that the gut microbiota especially Akkermansia muciniphila and related metabolites might play an important role in TFRD against OP, and deserve further study by follow-up experiment. This conclusion provides new theoretical support for mechanism research of TFRD against OP.",

      "abstract": "To study Cassia alata (CA) (Linnaeus) Roxburgh's effectiveness towards atopic dermatitis (AD), CA leaf extracts were prepared using three methanol-based extraction solvent systems. Bioactive constituents were characterized and quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, a major AD exacerbation factor, were assessed. Four polyphenols (two flavonoids, two anthraquinones) beneficial in AD control were detected (rhein > aloe-emodin > astragalin > kaempferol). The 75% v/v MeOH/water extract had the most polyphenols and the best antioxidant profile (total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-hydrate radical scavenging activity, ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity), with excellent S. aureus inhibition (minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.625 mg/mL; minimum bactericidal concentration = 1.25 mg/mL). Hence, it was selected for the in vitro examination of cytotoxicity and wound healing activity towards human epidermal keratinocyte cells using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and wound scratch assay. The extract showed no cytotoxicity (IC50 > 100 µg/mL) without significant reduction in cell viability up to 200 µg/mL compared to the vehicle control. An amount of 50 μg/mL extract concentration showed the best wound-healing activity (p < 0.05), with a cell migration rate of 5.89 ± 0.80 µm/h over 96 h post-treatment. Such antioxidant, antimicrobial, and wound-healing activities suggest CA and its polyphenols to be promising natural, long-term AD remedies for skin health."

      "abstract": "Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl., commonly known as loquat, is a plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. While its fruit is widely consumed as food and used in traditional medicine, research on other parts of the plant remains insufficient. Therefore, the chemical constituents and biological activities of its leaves were investigated. Phytochemical analysis of E. japonica leaves identified 30 compounds, including flavonoids, phenolics, and megastigmanes. The flavonoids isolated from the leaves include flavones, flavans, flavolignans, flavonoid glycosides, and coumaroyl flavonoid glycosides. Coumaroyl flavonoid rhamnosides were characteristically present in E. japonica leaves, and the configurations of coumaric acids, as well as the binding position to the rhamnose in each compound, were identified through detailed NMR analysis. Notably, three of them were isolated from this plant for the first time. Phenolic compounds were found to be present as conjugates with organic acids, such as quinic acid, shikimic acid, and glucose. Flavonoid and phenolic compounds demonstrated significant antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory effects, whereas megastigmanes showed little activity. Notably, coumaroyl flavonoid rhamnosides, which consist of flavonoids combined with the phenolic acid, coumaric acid, exhibited excellent anti-diabetic effects. Further molecular docking analysis confirmed that these compounds effectively bind to the α-glucosidase enzyme. In conclusion, the present study identified flavonoid and phenolic components with various structures in E. japonica leaves and clarified their anti-diabetic and antioxidant effects. These findings support the beneficial potential of E. japonica leaves for the treatment and/or prevention of metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Background: Insufficient treatment options are available for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Flavonoids and topiramate have been studied for weight loss but need investigation into their effects on liver metabolism. This study's aim was to examine the effects of flavonoids or topiramate on glucose metabolic carbon flux in a cell culture model of steatosis. Methods: Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells through exposure to oleic acid (OA, 0.5 mml/L) conjugated to bovine serum albumin (2:1). Additionally, 50% U13C-glucose was supplied in the medium as a stable isotope tracer. Cells were treated with DMSO, 10 μM of naringenin, morin, silibinin, or topiramate (44 μM) for 72 h. A non-steatotic, untreated HepG2 cell control was included. Cell extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and mass isotopomer distribution analysis for glycogen synthesis, de novo fatty acid synthesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and ribose synthesis. Groups were compared by ANOVA with Tukey's pair-wise testing. Results: Compared to untreated HepG2 controls, OA-exposed steatotic cells exhibited increased lipid accumulation by ORO staining (1.6-fold), enhanced palmitate de novo synthesis, reduced pyruvate carboxylase/pyruvate dehydrogenase (PC/PDH) ratio, and reduced ribose synthesis. Treatment with topiramate or silibinin ameliorated the lipid accumulation (1.3-fold) and mitigated enhancement of de novo synthesis. Morin-treated cells exhibited enhanced de novo synthesis but suppressed ribose synthesis. Conclusions: Potential mechanisms of reduced lipid accumulation by topiramate and silibinin may include suppression of palmitate de novo synthesis and a relative decrease in carbon flux through the PDH pathway. Further studies are needed on potential utility in MASLD based on their specific metabolic effects.",

In this review, we reported the recent advances in both in vitro and in vivo studies of flavonoids and their synthetic derivatives targeting the ER signaling pathway, including the target and mechanism of action of these molecules, as well as their structure-activity relationship. Based on the available literature, the beneficial effects of flavonoids as ER targeting agents are promising but they require further in vitro and in vivo studies to enable its translation from bench to bedside.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore the protective effect and underlying mechanism of Quzhou Aurantii Fructus flavonoids (QAFF) on Ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The constituents of QAFF were accurately determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The therapeutic impacts of QAFF were assessed in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice, focusing on the changes in body weight, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological assessment of colonic tissues, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of tight junction proteins. Western blotting confirmed key regulatory proteins within the differential signaling pathways, guided by transcriptome analysis. Additionally, the influence of QAFF on the gut microbiome was explored through 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing. The alterations in endogenous metabolites were detected by untargeted metabolomics, and their potential correlation with intestinal flora was then examined utilizing Spearman correlation analysis. Subsequently, the regulation of gut microbiome by QAFF was validated by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). RESULTS: Eleven flavonoids, including Naringin and hesperidin, were initially identified from QAFF. In vivo experiments demonstrated that QAFF effectively ameliorated colitis symptoms, reduced IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels, enhanced intestinal barrier integrity, and downregulated PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Furthermore, QAFF elevated the levels of beneficial bacteria like Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Alloprevotella and concurrently reduced the pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia-Shigella, [Eubacterium]_siraeum_group, and Parabacteroides. Metabolomics analysis revealed that 34 endogenous metabolites exhibited significant alterations, predominantly associated with Glycerophospholipid metabolism. These metabolites were significantly correlated with those differential bacteria modulated by QAFF. Lastly, the administration of QAFF via FMT ameliorated the colitis symptoms. CONCLUSION: QAFF could ameliorate inflammatory responses and intestinal barrier dysfunction in DSS-induced UC mice probably by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and gut microbiome, offering promising evidence for the therapeutic potential of QAFF in UC treatment."

      "abstract": "Global metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming is a common event in plant abiotic stress responses, however, the relevant molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the physiological function and molecular mechanism for the rice UGT706F1. We found that UGT706F1 can be potently induced by high temperature. Its overexpression can markedly enhance the heat tolerance of rice through improving the capacity of scavenging reactive oxygen species, whereas its functional deletion results in heat sensitivity in rice. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of UGT706F1 in response to high temperature, we carried out extensive screening of the in vitro enzymatic activity of UGT706F1 and discovered that UGT706F1 exhibits broad-spectrum activity toward flavonoid compounds. Through targeted flavonoid metabolomics analysis, we further revealed that the overexpression of UGT706F1 elevated the content of diverse flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides in rice. Subsequently, via transcriptome analysis, we found that following heat treatment, the overexpression of UGT706F1 was capable of enhancing the transcriptional activity of those genes including the flavonoid synthases, heat shock factors, heat shock proteins, glutathione S-transferase, and various antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, we identified an R2R3 MYB-type transcription factor MYB61 and demonstrated that MYB61 could directly bind the promoter of UGT706F1 and activate the transcription of UGT706F1. The overexpression of MYB61 also enhanced the heat tolerance and increased flavonoid glycosides. Overall, this study unveiled a novel pathway of the plant heat tolerance response mediated by MYB61-UGT706F1 module and identified a new UGT player for the metabolic and transcriptional regulation under high-temperature circumstance.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health burden, with hyperglycemia as the main hallmark. This review commences with a concise overview of the intricate mechanisms underlying glucose uptake and utilization in organisms. Notably, we emphasize that T2DM management strategies pivot on delaying carbohydrate digestion, augmenting insulin secretion, and enhancing insulin sensitivity in target tissues. Unfortunately, the drugs currently available in the market for the treatment of T2DM have unpleasant side effects, spurring an urgent quest for safer and more efficacious alternatives. Flavonoids, emerging as a promising class of bioactive compounds derived from plants, offer a multi-faceted approach to diabetes treatment. Specifically, they potently inhibit enzymes such as α-amylase, α-glucosidase, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B). Through an in-depth analysis, this review not only summarizes these inhibitory actions but also establishes the structure-activity relationship (SAR), providing a blueprint for rational drug design. However, the clinical translation of flavonoids has been hampered by their suboptimal water solubility and bioavailability, attributable to the characteristic carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. Ingeniously, this chemical quirk has been harnessed to engineer metal chelates, which exhibit enhanced pharmacokinetic profiles. Herein, we offer an exhaustive overview of the latest advancements in flavonoid metal complexes research, spotlighting their potential as next-generation diabetes therapeutics. Available data are poised to galvanize the development of novel flavonoid derivatives, be it as potent drugs or functional foods, for combating T2DM."

      "abstract": "Alpiniae oxyphyllae fructus (AOF) has been widely used for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Flavonoids, namely, baicalein, wogonin, and pinocembrin, are bioactive components with neuroprotective effects against AOF. Herein, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced in vitro inflammatory blood-brain barrier (BBB) model of a co-culture of hCMEC/D3 and HA1800 cells was constructed to investigate the permeability of flavonoids. The values of transmembrane resistance (TEER), apparent permeability (Papp) of sodium fluorescein (Na-F), and levels of TNF-α and IL-1β confirmed the construction of the in vitro inflammatory BBB model. An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was established to quantify the permeability of the three flavonoids. The average coefficients (R2) of the calibration curves were better than 0.99. The intraday and interday accuracies ranged from -13.75 % to 6.37 % and -14.28 % to 11.80 %, respectively. The recoveries and matrix effects were higher than 88.00 % and 92.42 %, respectively. These results indicated that the methodology was reliable. Compared with the normal BBB model, the permeability and efflux ratios of the three flavonoids significantly increased using the inflammatory BBB model. Papp BL→AP of wogonin and pinocembrin increased by approximately 1.3 and 5.5 times, respectively, thereby increasing the efflux ratios by 48 % and 76 %, respectively. The efflux ratios of the three flavonoids in the AOF were all < 2, demonstrating that they passed through the BBB in a passive diffusion way. This study investigated flavonoid transport from the AOF using the in vitro inflammatory BBB model, providing a material basis for neuroprotection as a potential drug for treating CNS diseases.",

      "abstract": "The poor structure stability and low bioavailability of lycopene (LY) hampers the wide application in food field. Thus, it is crucial to explore novel deliver carrier for LY based on protein-flavonoid complexes. In this study, the noncovalent interaction mechanism between β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) and flavonoids (apigenin (API), luteolin (LUT), myricetin (MY), apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, and myricetrin) under ultrasound treatment was explored. Results revealed that ultrasound treatment promoted reactive groups exposure and structural unfolding of β-LG to interact with six flavonoids. The main driving force between β-LG and flavonoids was hydrophobic interaction. The docking result showed that the preferred binding site for these flavonoids was on the outer surface of β-LG. The thermal stability, surface hydrophilicity, and antioxidant properties of β-LG-API, β-LG-LUT, and β-LG-MY complexes were superior by multi-spectroscopy methods and molecular simulation analysis (P < 0.05). The ability of β-LG-API for delivering LY was the best among above three binary complexes, revealing superior environmental stability and bioavailability of the β-LG-API-LY complex. This study will help to understand the ultrasound-assisted noncovalent binding of protein-flavonoid complexes, and exhibit the potential as a novel delivery system for delivery and protection of LY."

It has been reported that some plant flavonoids can enhance the antibacterial effects of antibiotics and even reverse AMR. This study systematically evaluated the synergistic effects of plant flavonoids and clinical antibiotics. Methods: The antibacterial activities of thirty-seven plant flavonoids and nine clinical antibiotics with various antimicrobial mechanisms were determined using the microbroth dilution method. Subsequently, the combined effects of twelve plant flavonoids presenting definite MICs against Staphylococcus aureus with these nine antibiotics were determined using the checkerboard test, together with those of thirty-two plant flavonoids presenting definite MICs against Escherichia coli with these nine antibiotics. Results: Plant flavonoids in combination with antibiotics present extensive synergistic effects, and 25% of combinations exhibited synergy against S. aureus and 50% against E. coli, particularly with antibiotics affecting cell membranes or ribosomes. Conclusions: The findings align with the drug selection principle of synergistic combinations and suggest that plant flavonoids could extensively enhance antibiotic efficacy. Considering that various metabolites from microorganisms, plants, and animals on the Earth would definitely impact the evolution of AMR, together with the rules, key factors, and important principles of drug combination for preventing AMR, we further propose the \"One Earth-One Health (OE-OH)\" concept, emphasizing ecosystem interactions in AMR prevention."

Willd. is a traditional medicinal herb in Chinese medicine, extensively used by various ethnic groups due to the numerous advantages derived from its total flavonoids. These benefits encompass anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and the promotion of melanin production, showcasing its significant efficacy in addressing vitiligo. To improve transdermal absorption and enhance the antioxidant effectiveness of the treatment, ethosome containing total flavonoids were prepared utilizing the ultrasound injection technique. The resulting ethosome was then carefully mixed with 0.7% Carbomer 934 gel in equal parts, yielding a gel concentration of 0.302 mg/g. This formulation produced small, consistent ethosome that exhibited high encapsulation efficiency and notable stability. In vitro analyses demonstrated sustained release characteristics of the gel and considerable therapeutic effectiveness against vitiligo resulting from hydroquinone exposure. Histological examinations performed through hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of mouse skin revealed increased melanin production and increased activities of tyrosinase (TYR), cholinesterase (CHE), and mouse monoamine oxidase (MAO), while levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were reduced. These findings underscore the promising effectiveness of this treatment strategy and validate the efficacy of the dosage form."

Thus, the purpose of this article is to present current research on natural flavonoids to reduce the incidence of CVDs by protecting intestinal barrier injury, with a particular emphasis on intestinal epithelial barrier integrity (inhibiting oxidative stress, regulating inflammatory cytokine expression, and increasing tight junction protein expression). Furthermore, the mechanisms driving intestinal barrier injury development are briefly explored, as well as natural flavonoids having CVD-protective actions on the intestinal barrier. In addition, natural flavonoids with myocardial protective effects were docked with ZO-1 targets to find natural products with higher activity. These natural flavonoids can improve intestinal mechanical barrier function through anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory mechanism, and then prevent the occurrence and development of CVDs."

The management of IBD often involves repairing the mechanical, chemical, immune, or biological barriers of the intestinal mucosa to alleviate symptoms. Currently, the treatment of IBD patients requires continuous medication or surgical interventions, which can cause irreversible damage to the patient's body over time. Natural flavonoids, commonly found in human diets, offer a safe, effective, and non-toxic alternative, presenting significant potential for promoting intestinal health and disease prevention.

Methods: First, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprints were established to obtain the main chemical components of THF. According to the network pharmacology databases, collect active targets of AHI and potential targets. Using interaction targets to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Finally, the affinity between the core targets and the main active ingredients was verified by molecular docking. Next, verified network pharmacology predictions with animal experiments. Mice were treated with THF (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) for 7 days, and then built an acute liver injury model (lipopolysaccharide [LPS], 10 mg/kg). Detecting the liver biochemical indices, observe the liver pathological changes, and verify the key signaling pathway targets. Results: HPLC showed that the main components of THF were quercetin and kaempferol. Seven active ingredients and 193 potential targets were screened, and 259 disease targets related to acute liver injury, quercetin, and kaempferol may be the main active ingredients in THF. PPI network analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor protein 53 (TP53) were potential targets of THF for the treatment of AHI. KEGG analysis showed that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway might be one of the main pathways in the treatment of AHI. The molecular docking results showed that active compounds both have strong binding activity with potential targets in PPI. In vivo experiments showed that THF could reduce the fibrosis and inflammation of liver tissue etc. Meanwhile, it could downregulate the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the protein expressions of phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT), and the ratio of BCL2-associated X (BAX)/B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) in the liver tissue of the mice with acute liver injury and upregulate the level of interleukin-10 (IL-10). Conclusion: The treatment of acute liver injury with THF is characterized by multicomponents and multitargets, and its mechanism may be related to the alleviation of the inflammatory response, reduction of apoptosis, and regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",

PEF treatment with previously established empirically tailored parameters [E = 0.3 kV/cm (U = 3 kV, d = 10 cm), t = 50 µs, N = 33 f = 1 Hz] was applied 1-3 times to S. baicalensis roots submerged in four different Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) media (1-choline chloride/xylose (1:2) + 30% water, 2-choline chloride/glucose (1:2) + 30% water, 3-choline chloride/ethylene glycol (1:2), and 4-tap water (EC = 0.7 mS/cm). Confocal microscopy was utilized to visualize the impact of PEF treatment on the root cells in situ. As a result of plant cell membrane permeabilization, an extract containing major active metabolites was successfully acquired in most media, achieving the best results using medium 1 and repeating the PEF treatment twice (baicalein <LOQ, baicalin 12.85 µg/mL, wogonin 2.15 µg/mL, and wogonoside 3.01 µg/mL). Wogonin concentration in NADES media was on par with the control (plants harvested on the day of the experiment, ultrasound-mediated methanolic extraction, Cwogonin = 2.15 µg/mL). After successful extraction, PEF treatment allowed the plants to continue growing, with the lowest survival rate across treated groups being 60%. Additionally, an enhancement in plant growth parameters (length and fresh mass of the roots) and significant changes in the S. baicalensis root phytochemical profile were also observed.",

A total of 2100 one-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks were distributed into 70 replicates, randomly assigned to one of seven dietary treatments and raised during the summer for 37 days. The treatments included normal stocking density (NSD, 10 birds/m2); HSD (15 birds/m2); HSD + 50 ppm of bacitracin (BCT); HSD + 300 ppm of flavonoids (FVNs); HSD + 80 ppm of isoquinoline alkaloids (IQAs); HSD + FVNs (1-10 days) and IQAs (11-37 days) (FVN-IQA); and HSD + IQAs (1-10 days) and FVNs (11-37 days) (IQA-FVN). The HS index reached or exceeded 160 during most of the experimental period. From 11 to 24 days of age, the HSD and BCT birds had lower body weight gain. The FVNs, IQAs, and their combinations decreased the corticosterone, IL-6, malondialdehyde, and heterophil-lymphocytes ratio compared to the HSD. Jejunal, ileal, and duodenal villi height/crypt depth ratio was lower in HSD than in other treatments except BCT. The α- and β-diversity, microbiota composition, and metabolic pathways were affected by treatment groups. Overall, FVNs, IQAs, and their combinations improved the growth performance, anti-inflammatory response, and gut health in broilers under HSD and HS, with the combinations exerting synergistic effects."

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of interrelated metabolic abnormalities that significantly elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Flavonoids, a diverse class of bioactive polyphenolic compounds found in plant-derived foods and beverages, have garnered increasing attention as potential therapeutic agents for improving metabolic health. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic effects of flavonoids in the context of the MetS, with a particular focus on their modulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPK serves as a central regulator of cellular energy balance, glucose metabolism, and lipid homeostasis, making it a critical target for metabolic intervention. Through a systematic review of the literature up to April 2024, preclinical studies across various flavonoid subclasses, including flavonols, and flavan-3-ols, were analysed to elucidate their mechanistic roles in metabolic regulation. Many studies suggests that flavonoids enhance glycolipid metabolism by facilitating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation and activating the AMPK pathway, thereby improving glycemic control in diabetes models. In obesity-related studies, flavonoids demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on lipid synthesis, reduced adipogenesis, and attenuated proinflammatory cytokine secretion via AMPK activation. These findings show the broad therapeutic potential of flavonoids in addressing the MetS and its associated disorders. While these preclinical insights highlight flavonoids as promising natural agents for metabolic health improvement, it is important to note that their excessive concentrations may disrupt these pathways, potentially leading to metabolic imbalance and cytotoxicity. Further studies and clinical trials are essential to determine optimal dosing regimens, formulations, and the long-term safety and efficacy of flavonoids. This review highlights the importance of flavonoids for natural interventions targeting MetS and its comorbidities, offering a foundation for future translational research.",

      "abstract": "Flavonoids are a group of plant secondary metabolites that have a number of health-promoting properties and have both preventive and therapeutic effects. Research confirms that flavonoids work, among others: antiviral and anticancer. Apigenin, luteolin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin, hesperetin, naringenin, epicatechin and genistein have documented antiviral activity. The discovery of the anticancer activity of flavonoids (including apigenin, naringenin, hesperetin) initiated a number of studies to identify the most active compounds against various cancers and to understand the mechanism of their action. However, the relationship between flavonoid intake and cancer risk appears to be non-linear. Available literature data suggest that flavonoids may act as therapeutic agents in the early stages of virus infection and as an anticancer agent and should be included in the daily diet by increasing the consumption of primarily fruit (chokeberry, elderberry, cherry, mandarin), vegetables (parsley, celery, onion) and herbs and spices (mint, oregano, lovage, moringa, saffron). Flavonoids present in food are transported by passive diffusion (hydrophobic aglycones) and by active transport (hydrophilic glycosides). Individual classes of flavonoids differ in the amount they appear in food, the metabolites they produce and their possible impact on health. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the potential use of selected flavonoids in the treatment of diseases of various etiologies, with an indication of their anticancer and antiviral effects. The perspectives and possibilities of using these compounds are presented, taking into account the problems resulting from their bioavailability.",

This study aimed to develop a more effective and less toxic therapy by utilizing zein nanoparticles (ZNPs) in combination with a nonpolar fraction (DCMF) from Fridericia platyphylla (Syn. Arrabidaea brachypoda), a plant rich in dimeric flavonoids called brachydins. Methods: Zein nanoparticles were used as carriers to encapsulate DCMF. The system was characterized by measuring particle diameter, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency. Analytical techniques such as FTIR, DSC, and AFM were employed to confirm the encapsulation and stability of DCMF. Antileishmanial activity was assessed against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes and amastigotes, while cytotoxicity was tested on RAW264.7 macrophages. Results: The ZNP-DCMF system exhibited favorable properties, including a particle diameter of 141 nm, a polydispersity index below 0.2, and a zeta potential of 11.3 mV. DCMF was encapsulated with an efficiency of 94.6% and remained stable for 49 days. In antileishmanial assays, ZNP-DCMF inhibited the viability of promastigotes with an IC50 of 36.33 μg/mL and amastigotes with an IC50 of 0.72 μg/mL, demonstrating higher selectivity (SI = 694.44) compared to DCMF alone (SI = 43.11). ZNP-DCMF was non-cytotoxic to RAW264.7 macrophages, with a CC50 > 500 μg/mL. Conclusions: Combining F. platyphylla DCMF with zein nanoparticles as a carrier presents a promising approach for leishmaniasis treatment, offering improved efficacy, reduced toxicity, and protection of bioactive compounds from degradation."

Materials and Methods: A case series derived from a randomized controlled trial was conducted to explore the effects of daily vitamin C supplementation, with or without flavonoids, on periodontal conditions. The study population was recruited from patients with periodontitis who had been referred to the Department of Periodontology at the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA). The study consisted of a 2-month observation of untreated periodontitis followed by a 3-month period after NSPT. Descriptive statistics, correlation and clustering analyses, and dimensionality reduction methods were used to evaluate the interventions' impact. Results: Due to COVID-19, the study was prematurely terminated and reported findings from 13 patients. Results indicate a correlation between higher plasma vitamin C levels and reduced gingival inflammation, suggesting benefits for untreated periodontal conditions. Clustering analysis showed no differences based on supplementation type, indicating it did not affect outcomes, and microbiological data had limited effects. Principal Component Analysis visualized clusters and illustrated no distinct groups corresponding to supplementation types. Violin plots highlighted variability, with one cluster comprising individuals with more severe periodontal conditions. Conclusions: Higher plasma vitamin C levels were associated with lower gingival inflammation. However, daily vitamin C supplementation, with or without flavonoids, did not show additional benefits on periodontal conditions before or after treatment. Clustering suggests that periodontal severity, rather than supplementation, influenced patient profiles. The study's small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of varying concentrations of peanut shell flavonoids (PSFs) on the properties of peanut meal extract-tilapia skin protein composite films and their impact on cherry tomatoes preservation. Peanut meal alcohol extract (Pe) and tilapia skin protein (Co) were used as base materials, combined with PSFs to prepare composite films with excellent antioxidant properties. The results demonstrated that the optimized composite films exhibited superior mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 9.83 MPa and an elongation at break of 204.04%. Increased flavonoid content enhanced the films' antioxidant capacity, achieving superoxide anion and DPPH radical scavenging rates of 15.08% and 21.37%, respectively. The microstructure, IR spectra, and circular dichroism spectra of the composite films are also significantly different with the change of flavonoid content. In the cherry tomato preservation experiment, the PeCo-0.5 composite film treatment group maintained a low weight loss rate (11.18%) and malondialdehyde content (13.33 μmol/g) after 15 days, delayed the peak respiration rate, and significantly reduced the peak respiration intensity (3.43 mgCO2∙ mg-1∙gh-1). At the same time, the activity of polyphenol oxidase in the tissue of Cherry Tomatoes was significantly inhibited, and the decrease rate of Vc content was also significantly decreased, which effectively preserving the bright color, smooth appearance, and good aroma of the cherry tomatoes. This study not only provides new insights into the comprehensive utilization of tilapia skin and peanut by-products but also opens new avenues for the development and application of fruit and vegetable preservation films."

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a major etiological factor underpinning a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, leading to cerebral infarction, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. The chronic progression of AS, spanning from initial plaque formation to the occurrence of acute cardiovascular events, underscores the complexity of AS and the challenges it presents in terms of treatment. Currently, the clinical management of AS relies predominantly on statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, which primarily aim to reduce low-density lipoprotein levels and have demonstrated some therapeutic efficacy. Nevertheless, due to their potential side effects, there is a pressing need to actively investigate alternative treatment approaches. Researches on natural compounds derived from herbal medicines, such as flavonoids, hold significant promise in combating AS by regulating lipid metabolism, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, inhibiting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, modulating autophagy and additional pathways. Various targets participate in these physiological processes, encompassing acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), transcription factor EB (TFEB) and so on. This comprehensive review endeavors to synthesize and analyse the most recent findings on herbal flavonoids, shedding light on their anti-atherosclerotic potential and the underlying protective mechanisms and related-targets, which might pave the way for the development of novel drug candidates or the optimization of flavonoid-based therapies.",

Several researches suggest a significant correlation between dietary flavonoids intake and gut microbiota, while the relationship between dietary flavonoids and constipation has not been reported. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between flavonoids intake and constipation. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis was based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected from 2007 to 2010. The dietary flavonoid and subclasses intake value were obtained from the United States Department of Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), while constipation was defined using the stool consistency or frequency. Relationships between total and six main flavonoid subclasses intake constipation were investigated using weighted logistic regression approach. RESULTS: The study revealed a negative association between isoflavones, anthocyanidins, flavanones, flavones, flavonols, and total flavonoid intake and constipation, with significant p-trends of < 0.05. Following multivariate adjustment, decreased odds of constipation could still be observed in the highest quartiles of anthocyanidins compared with those in the reference quartiles (p-value = 0.03). Ln-transformed anthocyanidins exhibited a statistically significant nonlinear association with constipation, displaying an inverted U-shaped pattern. When anthocyanidins intake exceeded 0.92 mg, the rate of constipation trended downward with increases in anthocyanidins intake. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that higher dietary flavonoids intake can reduce the incidence of constipation in the adult US population. In addition, the negative association between anthocyanin intake and constipation was more stable compared to other subclasses.",

This study employed single-factor experiments and the response surface methodology to identify the optimal germination conditions for enhancing the total flavonoid content in buckwheat sprouts through ultraviolet-B treatment. The research showed that buckwheat sprouts germinated for 3 days at a temperature of 28.7 °C while being exposed to ultraviolet-B radiation at an intensity of 30.0 μmol·m-2·s-1 for 7.6 h per day during the germination period resulted in the highest total flavonoid content of 1872.84 μg/g fresh weight. Under these specified conditions, ultraviolet-B treatment significantly elevated the activity and gene expression levels of enzymes related to the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase, and chalcone isomerase. Ultraviolet-B treatment caused oxidative damage to buckwheat sprouts and inhibited their growth, but ultraviolet-B treatment also enhanced the activity of key enzymes in the antioxidant system, such as catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidase. This research provided a technical reference and theoretical support for enhancing the isoflavone content in buckwheat sprouts through ultraviolet-B treatment."

      "abstract": "With the passage of time, people step toward old age and become more prone to several diseases associated with the age. One such is Alzheimer's disease (AD) which results into neuronal damage and dementia with the progression of age. The existing therapeutics has been hindered by various enkindles like less eminent between remote populations, affordability issues and toxicity profiles. Moreover, lack of suitable therapeutic option further worsens the quality of life in older population. Developing an efficient therapeutic intervention to cure AD is still a challenge for medical fraternity. Recently, alternative approaches attain the attention of researchers to focus on plant-based therapy in mitigating AD. In this context, flavonoids gained centrality as a feasible treatment in modifying various neurological deficits. This review mainly focuses on the pathological facets and economic burden of AD. Furthermore, we have explored the possible mechanism of flavonoids with the preclinical and clinical aspects for curing AD. Flavonoids being potential therapeutic, target the pathogenic factors of AD such as oxidative stress, inflammation, metal toxicity, Aβ accumulation, modulate neurotransmission and insulin signaling. In this review, we emphasized on potential neuroprotective effects of flavonoids in AD pathology, with focus on both experimental and clinical findings. While preclinical studies suggest promising therapeutic benefits, clinical data remains limited and inconclusive. Thus, further high-quality clinical trials are necessary to validate the efficacy of flavonoids in AD. The study aim is to promote the plant-based therapies and encourage people to add flavonoids to regular diet to avail the beneficial effects in preventive therapy for AD.",

This study aimed to evaluate the anti-depression effects of SCFs in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mice and to interrogate the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CUMS mice were used for assessing the effects of SCFs treatments on depression. Mice were randomly divided into five groups. Four groups were subjected to the CUMS induction and concomitantly administered orally with either the vehicle or with a high-, medium-, and low-dose of SCFs, once per day for 4 weeks. One group was kept untreated as a control. The mice were then assessed for their statuses of a number of depression-related parameters, including body weight, food intake, sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swim test (FST). In addition, a day after the completion of these tests, biopsies from the hippocampus were harvested and used to perform metabolomics by HPLC-MS/MS and to assess the levels of cAMP by ELISA and the levels of PKA, CREB, p-CREB, and BDNF by Western blot analyses. RESULTS: SCFs resulted in significant increases in both body weight and food intake and in the amelioration of the depressive-like behaviors in CUMS mice. A high-dose SCFs treatment led to significant alterations in 72 metabolites, of which 26 were identified as potential biomarkers for the SCFs treatment. These metabolites are associated with lipid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Among 26 metabolites, cAMP was positively correlated with body weight, SPT, OFT-total distance, and OFT-central residence time, while negatively correlated with immobility time in TST and FST, linking a change in cAMP with the SCFs treatment and the significant improvement in depressive symptoms in CUMS mice. Further analyses revealed that the levels of cAMP, PKA, CREB, p-CREB, and BDNF were reduced in the hippocampus of CUMS mice but were all increased following the SCFs treatments. CONCLUSION: SCFs could ameliorate hippocampal metabolic disturbances and depressive behaviors and cause the activation of the cAMP-PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway in the hippocampus of CUMS mice."

      "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with rising mortality rates globally. Its diagnosis is often challenging due to its asymptomatic nature in the early stages. Consequently, most patients receive a poor prognosis, with low survival rates within 5 years, as the disease is typically detected at an advanced stage, complicating effective treatment. Flavonoids, especially those derived from traditional Chinese herbal medicines, have attracted considerable attention for their potent anti-PC properties. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of these bioactive compounds, which modulate key biological pathways, making them promising candidates for PC intervention. Their mechanisms of action include the regulation of autophagy, apoptosis, cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and oxidative stress, as well as enhancing chemotherapeutic sensitivity, exerting antiangiogenic effects, and potentially boosting immunomodulatory responses. The demonstrated benefits of these natural compounds in cancer management have spurred extensive academic interest. Beyond their role as anti-cancer agents, flavonoids may provide both preventive and therapeutic advantages for PC, resonating with the core principles of traditional Chinese medicine for disease prevention and holistic treatment."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy among women globally and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new, effective treatment strategies for breast cancer. Research has shown that the enzyme nudix hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) plays a critical role in promoting breast cancer aggressiveness and serves as a key regulator of oncogenic pathways. The development of NUDT5 inhibitors presents a viable strategy for enhancing treatment results in managing BC. The ability of the flavonoids to modulate key biochemical pathways and improve therapeutic outcomes highlights their promise in developing novel breast cancer treatments. Hence, the main objective of the present investigation is to identify the potential interaction of structurally diverse bioactive flavonoids with the active site of the target NUDT5. Our docking analysis revealed that the flavonoids such as naringin and genistein have shown a significant binding association with residues Arg51, Asp60, Gln82, Arg84, Ala96, Leu98, Glu112, Glu116, Met132, Cys139, Ile141, and Glu166 of NUDT5, suggesting its potential as a potent inhibitor. The stabilizing effects of these leads (naringin and genistein) were further validated using molecular dynamics investigations, including RMSD, RMRF, Rg, SASA, PCA, and FEL. The results of the MD simulation studies evidenced a more significant interaction between genistein and NUDT5, indicating a steady and robust affinity, making genistein a more promising inhibitor. In conclusion, the flavonoid genistein has a strong potential as a therapeutic agent for targeting NUDT5 in breast cancer treatment making it viable candidates for further preclinical and clinical investigations."

Due to the lack of evidence-based medical evidence on the efficacy and safety of EF for the treatment of POP, the current systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out aimed at evaluating the curative effects and safety profile of EF treatment for POP in order to provide decision making references for clinical research. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases were searched from the date of inception to 11 August 2024. The outcomes of effectiveness and safety of included studies were collected to conduct meta-analysis or systematic review. RESULTS: A total of 6 RCTs were included in this study, involving 838 participants. Overall, our results revealed that the experimental group (EG) had comparable results of efficacy to the control group (CG). The lumbar vertebra bone mineral density (BMD) was statistically different compared to the CG (MD = 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.04; p = 0.0003), but the clinical significance deserved consideration because the 95% CI nearly crossed the invalid line. The femoral neck BMD was neither statistically different nor clinically different between two groups (MD = 0.00; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.02; p = 0.67). The total complication rates were comparable among the two groups (RR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.39, 1,19; p = 0.18). The quality of the evidence of the present study was judged as moderate and low based on the GRADE analysis. CONCLUSION: EF treatment exhibited good curative effects and safety. The result was comparable to the CG, including other Chinese patent medicines and calcium and vitamin D supplements. The EF treatment was proved to be a reliable alternative option for POP."

METHODS: The main chemical constituents of total flavonoids of Salvia divinorum were obtained through literature search, and their pharmacological mechanisms were predicted using bioinformatics analysis. In a mouse model of APAP-induced ALI, the protective effects of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg total flavonoids of Salvia miltiorrhiza and 150 mg/kg bifidus were evaluated by observing changes in blood biochemistry and liver histopathology and detecting expressions of the key proteins in the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis suggested that the main active components in total flavonoids of Salvia divinorum for regulating APAPinduced liver injury included quercetin, lignocerol, caruric acid, and kaempferol, for which GO function enrichment analysis yielded 632 GO entries, including 472 involving biological processes, 42 involving cellular composition, and 118 involving molecular function. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the total flavonoids of Salvia divinorum regulated APAP-induced liver injury mainly through ferroptosis-related signaling pathway. In mice with APAP-induced ALI, treatment with the total flavonoids significantly lowered ALT and AST levels, improved liver histopathology and inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced iron deposition in liver tissues, improved lipid peroxidation-related indexes, promoted the expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, SLC7A11, and GPX-4 proteins, and inhibited the expression of keap1 protein. CONCLUSION: The total flavonoids of Salvia divinorum alleviate APAP-induced ALI in mice possibly by suppressing hepatocyte ferroptosis via activating the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX-4 signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic, irreversible, non-infectious metabolic syndrome associated with low insulin production by the pancreas or due to insulin resistance. The management landscape for diabetes is swiftly evolving due to ongoing advancements. Conventional treatment approaches have struggled to fully address the root causes of the disease while also carrying significant risks of adverse effects. Flavonoids are an extensive class of phytonutrients present in grains, vegetables, fruits, cocoa, tea, wine, and nuts. Many studies have reported that flavonoids have shown diversified pharmacological activity in recent years. Thus, this review will give you an overview of the significant anti-diabetic potential of promising flavonoids. Various search engines such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and WoS have been explored by using the keywords \"apigenin,\" \"luteolin,\" \"naringenin,\" \"hesperidin,\" \"kaempferol,\" \"quercetin,\" \"myricetin\" and \"taxifolin\" with \"anti-diabetic.\" The anti-diabetic activity of flavonoids is attributed to various mechanisms, including α glucosidase, α-amylase inhibitory effects, GLUT4 expression, antioxidant, and apoptosis. However, their inadequate biopharmaceutical qualities make their effectiveness in clinical translation constrained. This review aims to highlight plant-derived flavonoids through in-vitro, in- -vivo, and clinical insights. Additionally, the review highlights the recent advancement in the drug delivery system in diabetes to overcome the limitation of flavonoids."

      "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and the ability of tumors to invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant organs. Despite significant advancements in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment, many cancers still present substantial challenges due to their heterogeneity, resistance to conventional therapies, and severe side effects of existing treatments. Consequently, there is an ongoing need for novel therapeutic agents to selectively target cancer cells, enhance the efficacy of current treatments, and minimize adverse effects. Isoorientin (ISO) is a naturally occurring flavonoid known for its anticancer properties. ISO has demonstrated the ability to influence several critical processes in cancer progression, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. Due to the absence of clinical trials, we included only in vitro studies, reviewing 13 investigations. These studies covered diverse cancer types, including lung, brain, oral, liver, pancreatic, and gastric cancers, and assessed various outcomes related to cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and molecular pathway modulation. By synthesizing data from these investigations, our review seeks to provide a thorough understanding of ISO's anticancer effects, its mechanisms of action, and its potential as a therapeutic agent.",

This study focused on chemical and cardiovascular analyses of Erythroxylum campestre A. St. Hil. leaf extracts. Methods: High-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to elucidate the structures of the flavonoids in E. campestre. The E. campestre methanolic fraction (ECM-ppt-M; at doses of 1, 2, 3, and 6 mg∙kg-1 or vehicle) was administered intravenously to normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and we recorded the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), renal vascular resistance (RVR), and aortic vascular resistance (AVC). Results: The ECM-ppt-M extract demonstrated significant antihypertensive activity, as evidenced by reductions in MAP, RVR, and AVR, with effects that were particularly pronounced in SHRs. Following the establishment of these cardiovascular effects, phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of glycosylated flavonoids, which are likely contributors to the observed antihypertensive properties of the extract. Conclusions: The notable reductions in MAP and vascular resistance observed with ECM-ppt-M treatment suggest its antihypertensive effect. These findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic value of this extract with regard to the treatment of hypertension. Future studies on ECM may provide a promising therapeutic alternative capable of reducing the risk of toxicity and adverse effects associated with synthetic drugs."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is considered the most ubiquitous malignant form of cancer, and the current treatment strategies do not offer effective outcomes to the patients. The present study examined the effectiveness of natural drugs delphinidin (DN) and oroxylin A (OA) in inhibiting the development of lung cancer cells (A549) through the blocking of the Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) intervene signaling pathways. These included cytotoxicity assessments, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, apoptotic morphological features, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), nuclear fragmentation, and cell cycle analysis. Furthermore, the combination of DN and OA treatments on the expression of STAT-3, FAK, and various proliferation and apoptotic proteins was studied using western blotting. The results we have obtained are that the combination of DN and OA causes significant cytotoxicity, ROS, alteration of ΔΨm, and nuclear fragmentation, resulting in apoptosis of A549 cells. Furthermore, A549 cells treated with DN and OA concurrently displayed increased cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Additionally, the combined DN and OA treatment inhibited the expression of STAT3 and FAK, suppressing proliferation and the induction of pro-apoptotic protein expressions in A549 cells. Thus, a combination of DN and OA could be used as a therapeutical approach to malignant forms of lung cancer."

      "abstract": "Despite the recent advancements in developing bioactive nutraceuticals as anticancer modalities, their pharmacodynamics, safety profiles, and tolerability remain elusive, limiting their success in clinical trials. The failure of anticancer drugs in clinical trials can be attributed to the changes in drug clearance, absorption, and cellular responses, which alter the dose-response efficacy, causing adverse health effects. Flavonoids demonstrate a biphasic dose-response phenomenon exerting a stimulatory or inhibitory effect and often follow a U-shaped curve in different preclinical cancer models. A double-edged sword, bioflavonoids' antioxidant or prooxidant properties contribute to their hormetic behavior and facilitate redox homeostasis by regulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. Emerging reports suggest a need to discuss the pharmacodynamic broad-spectrum of plant flavonoids to improve their therapeutic efficacy, primarily to determine the ideal dose for treating cancer. This review discusses the dose-response effects of a few common plant flavonoids against some types of cancers and assesses their safety and tolerability when administered to patients. Moreover, we have emphasized the role of dietary-rich plant flavonoids as nutraceuticals in cancer treatment and prevention.",

      "abstract": "Lycopi herba, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, has long been valued for its aerial parts. however, its roots, which are often discarded as non-medicinal waste, actually contain flavonoid compounds that possess potential medicinal values such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumor activities. Despite this, studies on the extraction, purification, and biological activity assessment of total flavonoids from L. herba roots (TFLHR) remain inadequate. Our study aimed to optimize the extraction and purification processes for TFLHR and evaluate their anti-proliferative effects on human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS-RA), which are key pathological cells in rheumatoid arthritis. By utilizing ultrasound-assisted extraction combined with response surface methodology (RSM), we optimized the extraction conditions, achieving a total flavonoid content of 90.484 ± 0.974 mg/g under the optimal settings: a liquid-solid ratio of 48:1 mL/g, 13 min of ultrasound treatment, 70 % ethanol, and an extraction temperature of 43°C. Subsequently, macroporous resin chromatography was employed for flavonoid purification, with AB-8 resin exhibiting the highest performance, achieving adsorption and desorption rates of 79.64 ± 1.51 % and 88.61 ± 1.02 %, respectively. By further refining the purification conditions through RSM, the purity of flavonoids was increased to 63.9 ± 1.86 %. Through ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) analysis, 74 flavonoid compounds across 15 categories were identified. Further activity studies demonstrated that purified TFLHR exhibited significant concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects on HFLS-RA cells. This study not only provides a scientific basis for the comprehensive utilization of L. herba root resources but also highlights the potential medicinal value of TFLHR in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, laying a foundation for future research into its specific mechanisms and clinical applications.",

However, its specific application and action mechanism in the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are still unclear. Methods: Total water-soluble flavonoids extracted from L. litseifolius (Hance) Chun (sweet tea) were applied to GDM mice. The glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and histopathology of the GDM mice were evaluated through an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT), and histochemistry. The possible mechanism was analysed through network pharmacology. Results: Compared with those in GDM model mice (MD group), blood glucose levels indicating both glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were improved in GDM mice treated with total water-soluble flavonoids (LLHC group) but were greater than those in normal control mice (NC group). The number of apoptotic liver cells was significantly lower in the LLHC group than in the MD group, but greater than that in the NC group. Multiple targets and signalling pathways that were acted by eight main active ingredients were involved in the process by which total water-soluble flavonoids protect against GDM. The main mechanism involved quercetin (10 targets) and luteolin (8 targets), which acted on the effector target of GAA through six main signalling pathways around the AKT1 core axis. Conclusion: Oral administration of total water-soluble flavonoids can alleviate glucose intolerance and insulin resistance via the inhibition of liver cell apoptosis. The main active ingredients act on GAA through the signalling pathways of the AKT1 core axis.",

Through its interactions with various proteins and lncRNAs, YBX1 promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Despite its significant role in cancer progression, studies on YBX1's protein-protein interactions (PPIs) remain limited. Flavonoids are natural compounds with anticancer properties that inhibit metastasis, modulate immunity, and induce apoptosis, with minimal systemic toxicity, making them strong candidates for cancer therapy. Targeting PPIs offers a promising approach for cancer therapy and flavonoids, with their anticancer properties, may modulate these interactions. Our study focused on the YBX1 PPI network, specifically targeting HSPA1A, IGF2BP1, MECP2, G3BP1, EWSR1, PURA, and SYNCRIP. We selected four flavonoids Quercetin, Fisetin, Rutin, and Myricitrin based on literature and conducted 26 docking sessions. Further ADMET analysis indicated Quercetin and Fisetin as more favorable for drug-likeness parameters than Rutin and Myricitrin, which was underscored by MD simulation data. In vitro studies showed that Quercetin and Fisetin downregulated YBX1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (50 μM to 150 μM) in MCF-7 cells. Our study provides a preliminary understanding of YBX1 PPI and the potential of flavonoids to disrupt these interactions. This study investigates the potential of flavonoids to target YBX1 PPIs, providing insights into novel therapeutic strategies for YBX1-driven cancers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flavonoids are increasingly recognized for their potent antioxidant properties and potential therapeutic roles in the management of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Extracts derived from Rhododendron nivale Hook. f. (FRN) have been shown to influence glutathione metabolism in aging animal models, exhibiting notable antioxidant effects. However, the specific impact of FRN on ALD remains insufficiently explored. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: This study seeks to elucidate the efficacy of FRN in alleviating the pathology associated with ALD, delving into the underlying molecular mechanisms that facilitate its protective effects. STUDY DESIGN: We employed network pharmacology to predict the functional roles and pathway enrichments associated with FRN targets. Both a murine model of ALD and in vitro cellular models were utilized to clarify the mechanistic basis by which FRN mitigates ALD. METHODS: FRN was extracted and characterized according to well-established methodologies outlined in our previous studies. Potential functions and pathways implicated by FRN were predicted through network pharmacology analyses. A combination of liver transcriptomics, targeted lipidomics, molecular biology techniques, and antagonists of relevant targets were employed to investigate the mechanisms through which FRN exerts its protective effects in ALD. RESULTS: Network pharmacology identified multiple target genes modulated by FRN, particularly those within critical ALD-related signaling pathways, such as PPARα signaling and fatty acids (FAs) degradation. Notably, treatment with FRN in the ALD murine model led to a significant attenuation of hepatic lipid accumulation and a restoration of serum AST and ALT to baseline ranges. Subsequent validation through liver transcriptomics and molecular biology techniques revealed an upregulation of PPARα expression concomitant with a downregulation of ACSL1 in FRN-treated ALD mice. Targeted lipidomic and bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that FRN substantially reduced the accumulation of long-chain fatty acids in hepatocytes. Importantly, the reversal of FRN's protective effects on lipid accumulation through the PPARα antagonist GW6471 provides compelling evidence for the critical role of PPARα signaling modulation in mediating the beneficial impact of FRN on ALD. CONCLUSION: Our research highlights FRN's capacity to alleviate ALD through PPARα pathway activation, paving the way for innovative treatment strategies. This underscores the significance of natural compounds in pharmacotherapy, suggesting that FRN may provide an effective alternative for managing ALD.",

Due to its significant role in regulating whole-body energy metabolism and other physiological processes, adipose tissue has been increasingly explored as a feasible therapeutic target for obesity. Flavonoids are one of the most significant plant polyphenolic compounds holding a great potential as therapeutic agents for combating obesity. However, understanding their mechanisms of action remains largely insufficient to formulate therapeutic theories. This review critically discusses scientific evidence highlighting the role of flavonoids in ameliorating obesity-related metabolic complications, including adipose tissue dysfunction, inflammation, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and cardiovascular comorbidities in part by modulating the release of adipokines and batokines. Further discussion advocates for the use of therapeutics targeting these bioactive molecules as a potential avenue for developing effective treatment for obesity and its adverse metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.",

Cellular stress responses significantly impact the pathophysiology of these disorders, often exacerbating neuronal damage. Plant-derived flavonoids have demonstrated potential as neuroprotective agents due to their potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the molecular processes and clinical insights that cause the neuroprotective properties of flavonoids in NDs. By controlling essential signaling pathways such as Nrf2/ARE, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt, flavonoids can lower cellular stress and improve neuronal survival. The study discusses the challenges of implementing these discoveries in clinical practice and emphasizes the therapeutic potential of specific flavonoids and their derivatives. Flavonoids are identified as potential therapeutic agents for NDs, potentially slowing progression by regulating cellular stress and improving neuroprotection despite their potential medicinal uses and clinical challenges. The study designed a strategy to identify literature published in prestigious journals, utilizing search results from PubMed, Scopus, and WOS. We selected and investigated original studies, review articles, and research reports published until 2024.

Flavonoids are their main active ingredients, but there are few reports on their simultaneous liver and eye protective effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: Overview of the role of flavonoids of the four medicinal flowers (FFMF) in the prevention and treatment of liver and eye diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, Google Scholar, and WanFang databases were searched for FFMF. Using \"hepatitis\", \"liver fibrosis\", \"liver cancer\", \"dry eye syndrome\", \"cataracts\", \"glaucoma\", \"age-related macular degeneration\", and \"diabetic retinopathy\" as the keywords, we summarized the main pathological mechanisms of these diseases and the role of FFMF in their prevention and treatment. RESULTS: We found that the four medicinal flowers contained a total of 125 flavonoids. They can maintain liver and eye homeostasis by regulating pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, and programmed cell death, exerting the effect of \"clearing the liver and improving vision\". CONCLUSION: FFMF have a series of beneficial properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antifibrotic activity, and the regulation of angiogenesis, glycolipid metabolism and programmed cell death, which may explain the efficacy of the four traditional Chinese medicines for \"Clearing the liver\" and \"Improving vision\".",

      "abstract": "The liver is the largest, important organ and the site for essential biochemical reactions in the human body. It has the function to detoxify toxic substances and synthesize useful biomolecules. Liver diseases related complications represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide, creating a substantial economic burden. Oxidative stress, excessive inflammation, and dysregulated energy metabolism significantly contributed to liver diseases. Therefore, discovery of novel therapeutic drugs for the treatment of liver diseases are urgently required. For centuries, flavonoids and their preparations which have the beneficial health effects in chronic diseases have been used to treat various human illnesses. Flavonoids mainly include flavones, isoflavones, flavanols, dihydroflavones, dihydroflavonols, anthocyanins and chalcones. The primary objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of flavonoids, mainly from a clinical point of view and considering clinically relevant end-points. We summarized the recent progress in the research of hepatoprotective and molecular mechanisms of different flavonoids bioactive ingredients and also outlined the networks of underlying molecular signaling pathways. Further pharmacology and toxicology research will contribute to the development of natural products in flavonoids and their derivatives as medicines with alluring prospect in the clinical application."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tetrastigma hemsleyanum is a folk and rare medicinal plant, and specifically, it is distributed in the south, China. To investigate the cumulative properties of its medicinal components, we examined the effect of UV light on flavonoid content and related enzyme activity changes in T. hemsleyanum. METHODS: The leaves and tubers were treated with UV-A, UV-B and UV-C for 1 h, 1L/23D h, 3 h and 3L/21D h (D represents darkness treatment). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the content of many flavonoids decreased significantly during UV-A treatment, increased after UV-B and UV-C irradiation and accumulated again after darkness treatment. RESULTS: In the root tubers of the UV-A group, naringin content in the 3L/21D h group (0.069 μg/g) was 16.30 times higher than that of 3 h group (0.0042 μg/g). The rutin content was elevated after UV irradiation but was not detected in the CK group. The test results of the enzyme-linked kit indicated that the activities of many enzymes were higher in the UV-A and UV-B irradiation groups than those in the CK group, but the results were reversed in the UV-C treatment. After darkness treatment, the activities of most enzymes were higher than those with UV irradiation alone; F3'5'H activity in the 3L/21D h group (97.25 U/L) was 1.24 times higher than that in the 3 h group (78.12 U/L) in the UV-A-treated group. DISCUSSION: The study results suggest that appropriate UV-B and UV-C irradiation, as well as darkness supplementation, had a promotive effect on flavonoids in the leaves and root tubers of T. hemsleyanum. Additionally, UV irradiation and darkness treatment enhanced the activity of most enzymes."

      "abstract": "Flavonoids, a diverse group of natural compounds abundant in plants, fruits, and seeds, are not only responsible for the vibrant colors, fragrances, and flavors found in nature but also possess significant health benefits. Representing a secondary metabolite, these phytonutrients contribute to overall well-being. They have garnered considerable interest due to their diverse biological roles, encompassing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Flavonoids exert anticancer properties by interfering with different signaling pathways and molecules. Also, they have been demonstrated to exert chemosensitization features, where flavonoids may enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and hold promise for improving cancer treatment outcomes as they have been discovered to make cancer cells more responsive to treatment. Understanding their influence on the regulation of cellular signaling provides a foundation for exploring their potential in combination with different chemotherapy agents and their possible single use for cancer treatment. Besides, they are believed to present a cost-effective approach to cancer therapeutics with possible implications for reducing the side effects of the current chemotherapy regimens, which can be a great therapeutic strategy for treating cancer types, including leukemia. This chapter explores potential approaches for creating anticancer treatments, focusing on leukemia, through integrating flavonoid nutraceuticals with traditional chemotherapy agents.",

These enzymes play critical roles in CSC protection, maintenance, cancer progression, therapeutic resistance, and poor prognosis. Thus, targeting ALDH isoforms offers potential for innovative cancer treatments. Flavonoids, known for their ability to affect multiple cancer-related pathways, have shown anticancer activity by downregulating specific ALDH isoforms. This study aimed to evaluate 830 flavonoids from the PubChem database against five ALDH isoforms (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, ALDH2, ALDH3A1) using computational methods to identify potent inhibitors. Extra precision (XP) Glide docking and MM-GBSA free binding energy calculations identified several flavonoids with high binding affinities. MD simulation highlighted flavonoids 1, 2, 18, 27, and 42 as potential specific inhibitors for each isoform, respectively. Flavonoid 10 showed high binding affinities for ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, and ALDH3A1, emerging as a potential multi-ALDH inhibitor. ADMET property evaluation indicated that the promising hits have acceptable drug-like profiles, but further optimization is needed to enhance their therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity, making them more effective ALDH inhibitors for future cancer treatment.",

METHODS: A total of 471 flavonoids from the genus Erythrina were subjected to molecular docking against AChE, followed by toxicity screening. The potential AChE inhibitors with the least toxic profile were subjected to further investigation through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) study, and in silico pharmacokinetic predictions. RESULTS: A combination of molecular docking and in silico toxicity screening led to the identification of 2(S)‒5,7‒dihydroxy‒5'‒methoxy‒[2'',2''‒(3''‒hydroxy)‒dimethylpyrano]‒(5'',6'':3',4') flavanone (89) and Abyssinoflavanone IV (83) as potential AChE inhibitors. These compounds had stable binding to AchE and exhibited lower Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values compared to the apo state of AChE. In addition, Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA) analysis revealed that the binding energies of 89 and 83 were significantly lower compared to acetylcholine, the natural substrate of AChE. Based on DFT study, these compounds exhibited a higher energy in the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and lower electron affinity (EA) than Quercetin. This indicated that 89 and 83 could be potential radical scavengers through their electron-donating activity. CONCLUSION: Although this study primarily relied on computational methods, the results showed the dual functionality of compounds 89 and 83 as both potential AChE inhibitors and free radical scavengers. Further investigation in wet laboratory experiments is required to validate their therapeutic potential for AD."

This study was devoted to the bibliometric analysis of articles and review articles in flavonoid therapy for UC research between 2011 and 2022 to show publication trends and research hotspots. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature search data for the bibliometric analysis were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection by searching for the terms \"Flavonoids\" and \"Ulcerative colitis or Idiopathic Proctocolitis or colitis gravis or Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Ulcerative Colitis Type.\" Three software programs, Bibliometrix, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer, were used to perform a bibliometric analysis of the retrieved literature data. RESULTS: There were 181 publications on flavonoids for UC during the 12 years, with an upward trend in annual publications and an annual growth rate of 27.11 %. China had the highest cumulative number of publications, and Kyung Hee University was the academic institution with the most publications in this research area. In recent years, intestinal flora, intestinal barrier, apoptosis, tight protein junctions, and TLR4/ NF-κB pathway have become hot spots for research on flavonoids for UC. Grape seed analogs have been extensively investigated for treating UC in the past three years. CONCLUSION: The results of this bibliometric study demonstrate the current status and trends of research on flavonoids for the treatment of UC and provide relevant researchers with hot topics and the latest research directions.",

Considering that the effectiveness of local wound treatment mainly depends on the rational treatment of the first phase of the wound process, we have developed a 1 % flavonoid cream and its production technology. The technology for the production of flavonoid cream includes extraction and isolation of the sum of flavonoids from the raw material of Populus balsamifera L. buds, preparation of flavonoid substance and excipients, preparation of the cream base and cream, packaging and labelling of cream. Based on the results of our experiments, a pilot industrial regulation for the production of a new cream based on the sum of flavonoids of Populus balsamifera L. buds has been developed, and pilot production of an original therapeutic and cosmetic cream was organised.",
