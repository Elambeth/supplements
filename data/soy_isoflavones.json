      "abstract": "Objectives: Ischemic stroke is a severe neurological disorder with high morbidity, mortality, and disability rates, posing a substantial burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. Soy isoflavone (SI), a naturally occurring phytoestrogen, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-stroke efficacy of SI and elucidate its underlying mechanisms through integrated phytochemical profiling, network pharmacology, and both in vitro and in vivo experimental validation. Methods: Active constituents of SI were extracted via reflux and identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Network pharmacology was employed to predict therapeutic targets and signaling pathways. The neuroprotective effects of SI were first assessed in PC12 cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in vitro. For in vivo evaluation, transient cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced using the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) model in adult male ICR rats (27.3 ± 1.8 g; 6-8 weeks old), obtained from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Forty-eight rats were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 12): sham, model (BCCAO), SI-treated (100 mg/kg, oral gavage for 5 days), and edaravone (EDA)-treated (10 mg/kg, i.p., positive control). All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Changchun Normal University (Approval No. 2024003, 13 March 2024) and conducted in accordance with the NIH guidelines and ARRIVE 2.0 reporting standards. Results: In vitro, SI significantly enhanced PC12 cell viability from 57.23 ± 2.88% to 80.76 ± 4.43% following OGD/R. It also reduced intracellular Ca2+ by 58.42%, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release by 37.67%, caspase-3 activity by 55.05%, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by 74.13% (p < 0.05). A flow cytometry analysis revealed that OGD/R increased the apoptosis rate from 5.34% (control) to 30.85% (model group), which was significantly attenuated by SI treatment, especially in the 560 µg/mL group (20.00%), followed by the 140 and 280 µg/mL groups. In vivo, SI improved neurological scores from 8.3 ± 1.09 to 6.8 ± 1.68, reduced cerebral infarction volume by 18.49%, and alleviated brain edema by 10.42% (p < 0.05). SI also decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and LDH levels by 31.15% and 39.46%, respectively, while increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 11.70%, catalase (CAT) by 26.09%, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) by 27.55% (p < 0.01). Scratch assay results showed that SI restored the impaired migratory ability of the OGD/R-treated PC12 cells, further supporting its role in cellular repair. A Western blot analysis demonstrated the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and the downregulation of Kelch-like, ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model. Conclusions: These findings indicate that soy isoflavone confers significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by enhancing endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting cell migration. The protective effects are likely mediated through the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway, supporting the therapeutic potential of SI in ischemic stroke treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Black Cohosh, Soy Isoflavones, and SDG Lignans in alleviating menopausal symptoms compared to a placebo. METHODS: Ninety-six postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive either the study supplements or a placebo for 90 days, with Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) scores collected at baseline and every 4 weeks to monitor symptom changes. Secondary outcomes assessed included hormonal variations and the incidence of adverse symptoms. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 90 participants completed the study with high adherence. Significant improvements were observed in the treatment group across all MRS domains: somatic (- 54.3% difference, p < 0.01), psychological (- 54.3% difference, p < 0.01), urogenital (-37.3% difference, p < 0.01), and total score (- 48.0% difference, p < 0.01). Hormonal changes were modest yet statistically significant for FSH (- 6.7% difference, p < 0.01) and estradiol (12.6% difference, p < 0.01). Adverse events were minimal, transient, and did not require cessation of supplementation. CONCLUSION: Black Cohosh, Soy Isoflavones, and SDG Lignans significantly reduced menopausal symptoms with a favorable safety profile. These findings support the potential of this supplement combination as a therapeutic option for menopausal symptom management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06328348.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is divided into primary and secondary types. Primary osteoporosis may result from estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women, imbalanced bone remodeling in the elderly, or imbalanced adolescent-type bone development. Secondary osteoporosis can be caused by factors like long-term glucocorticoid treatment, chronic kidney disease (CKD), estrogen deprivation, oxidative stress, diabetes, and obesity. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of soy isoflavones for osteoporosis. At the cellular level, soy isoflavones, as natural plant extracts and phytoestrogens, are crucial for osteoblastogenesis and differentiation, osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast mineralization, and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation. They also maintain calcium homeostasis by regulating extracellular calcium and vitamin D levels. In terms of oxidative stress, soy isoflavones mitigate it in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, thus regulating cellular senescence, autophagy, and bone remodeling processes. Moreover, soy isoflavones can relieve symptoms related to CKD and inhibit glucocorticoid secretion, which directly or indirectly benefits the treatment of osteoporosis. Overall, soy isoflavones have the potential to treat osteoporosis by enhancing bone health, regulating metabolism, and alleviating oxidative stress. Future research should explore the potential of soy isoflavones as phytoestrogens for treating osteoporosis. This exploration should focus on clarifying the safety, identifying potential side effects, determining the optimal dosage regimen, and developing strategies to mitigate any adverse reactions. In addition, further large-scale, multicenter human clinical trials are necessary to accurately evaluate the actual therapeutic effect of soy isoflavones on osteoporosis.",

Due to preventive and therapeutic effects of soy isoflavones (SI) and broccoli extract (BE) on tumor angiogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress and since endometriosis is accompanied by chronic inflammation, in this study, we aim to evaluate the potential role of these compounds on the pathological scores of endometriosis and also consider the expression level of the gene markers of autophagy, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in an endometriosis rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present experimental study, 45 mature female Sprague- Dawley rats weighing 220 ± 20 g at the age of eight weeks with surgically induced endometriosis was divided into five groups and treated for six weeks with normal saline (control group), BE, SI, BE+SI by oral gavage, and also Diphereline intramuscularly. The histopathological scores of the endometrial implants (0, 1, 2, 3: no, poorly, moderately and well-preserved epithelial layers, respectively) and the mRNA expression level of Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3, Beclin-1, Lc3, and Sod within peritoneal tissue were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Pathologic scores of the implants in the Diphereline (1.2 ± 0.27) and BE+SI (1.2 ± 0.41) groups were declined significantly in comparison with the control group (2.08 ± 0.44) (P≤0.001). In the endometriotic structures, the mRNA expression levels of our target genes were improved significantly (P≤0.01) in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study demonstrated that the simultaneous consumption of a certain amount of broccoli extract and SI can be considered as a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of endometriosis."

      "abstract": "Obesity, a factor increasing the risk of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, can be reduced by the intake of soy isoflavones. In this study, we investigated whether skeletal muscle PGC1α, a transcriptional activator known to promote a variety of exercise-related metabolic processes, is involved in the anti-obesity effects of soy isoflavones using skeletal muscle-specific PGC1α knockout mice. The results showed that the intake of soy isoflavones reduced white adipose tissue weight and increased expression of energy metabolism-related genes such as mitochondrial function, lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. However, these effects were not observed in skeletal muscle-specific PGC1α knockout mice. In C2C12 myoblasts with overexpressing PGC1α, soy isoflavone treatment increased energy-metabolism related genes. Therefore, PGC1α of skeletal muscle is likely to be involved in the anti-obesity effects of soy isoflavones.",

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of broccoli extract (BE) alone and in combination with soy isoflavones (SI) on endometrial implants in female rat. METHODS: In this study, endometriosis was induced surgically in 40 mature female rats. The rats were divided into 5 groups that were treated by oral gavage for 6 weeks with 0.5 mL of saline 0.9 %/day (control group), BE (3,000 mg/kg/day), SI (50 mg/kg/day), BE/soy isoflavones (BE 3000 mg/kg/day + soy isoflavones 50 mg/kg/day) and diphereline as a standard medication (3 mg/kg) intramuscularly. At the end of treatments, the volume and histopathology of the endometrial implants were compared among the 5 groups. The serum levels of oxidative parameters including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were also compared between the groups. The volume of the implants significantly decreased in diphereline group (p=0.002). RESULTS: The histopathological grade of endometrial implants in BE/SI and diphereline group were significantly decreased compared to the control group (p=0.001). The serum levels of SOD in BE group were enhanced significantly in comparison to the control group (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: BE in combination with SI decreased the growth and histopathologic grades of transplanted endometrial implants. These herbal compounds may have the potential therapeutic effect to be used as an alternative medication for the treatment of endometriosis."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of soy isoflavones supplementation on metabolic status in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 50 patients with NAFLD were randomly allocated to either soy isoflavone or placebo groups for 12 weeks. The soy isoflavone group took 100 mg/d soy isoflavone and the placebo group took the similar tablets containing starch. Anthropometric indices, blood lipids, glycemic parameters and blood pressure were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. RESULTS: At the end of week 12 the level of serum triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC) was significantly decreased only in soy isoflavone group compared to baseline (P < 0.05). Although waist circumference (WC) decreased significantly in both groups after 12 weeks of intervention (P < 0.05), hip circumference (HC) decreased significantly only in soy isoflavone group (P = 0.001). No significant changes observed regarding high density lipoprotein (HDL) and blood pressure in both groups. At the end of the study, serum glucose level was significantly decreased in the placebo group compared to baseline (P = 0.047). No significant changes demonstrated in the soy isoflavone group in regard to glycemic parameters (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that soy isoflavones could significantly reduce TG, LDL TC, WC and HC in NAFLD patients.

This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic potential of SI in the treatment of osteosarcoma (OS) and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, particularly focusing on mitophagy. METHODS: The effects of SI on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of U2OS cells were analyzed. Mitophagy was assessed through multiple parameters: mitochondrial autophagosomes, mitochondrial membrane potential, autophagy-related proteins, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Protein levels related to apoptosis, autophagy, and the AKT/mTOR pathway were analyzed using western blot. The therapeutic efficacy of SI was further identified using a mouse tumor xenograft model. Cell apoptosis and proliferation in tumor xenografts were detected by TUNEL staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. RESULTS: SI dose-dependently suppressed the viability, colony formation, migration, and invasion of U2OS cells, and enhanced the apoptosis. SI also dose-dependently induced mitophagy in OS cells, evidenced by an increase in autophagosomes and ROS levels, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and OCR, and concomitant changes in autophagy-related proteins. Mdivi-1, an inhibitor of mitophagy, reversed the anti-tumor effects of SI on U2OS cells. In addition, SI blocked the AKT/mTOR pathway in U2OS cells. SC-79, an AKT agonist, reversed the effect of SI on inducing mitophagy. Moreover, SI also promoted cell apoptosis and mitophagy in tumor xenografts in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: SI induces mitophagy in OS cells by blocking the AKT/mTOR pathway, contributing to the inhibition of OS.",

Different mechanisms of action have already been studied for the different isoflavones in multiple conditions, such as breast, gastrointestinal, and urogenital cancers. Many of these mechanisms of action could also be demonstrated in the prostate, both in vitro and in vivo. This review focuses on the known mechanisms of action at the cellular level and compares them between genistein, daidzein, and equol. These include androgen- and estrogen-mediated pathways, regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.

This review aimed to examine the effect of soy isoflavones to support decreased and variable E2 levels before and after menopause, linked to an investigation of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the protective influence of E2 on the serotonin pathway.

A systematic literature search was performed in three stages. 1,421 papers were screened for relevance to the research aims and objectives. 63 papers were selected based on pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria (13 reviews, 24 mechanistic and 26 intervention studies) and critically appraised. Available research supported the hypotheses that E2 increases serotonin synthesis and availability through stimulation of tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH-2) and decreased degradation by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A). There was less scientific agreement on the effects of E2 on serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin receptors 1 A and 2 A. Studies varied widely on the effectiveness of soy isoflavones in reducing depressive symptoms in (peri)menopausal women. Animal and human studies acknowledge women's increased risk of depression linked to fluctuating E2 rather than absolute levels. However, mechanisms linking E2 variability with depression remain an underrepresented area of research. Study limitations and heterogeneity may contribute to varying results for soy isoflavones and some effects of E2 on the serotonin pathway.",

METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, open-label study enrolled 44 postmenopausal women suffering from moderate-to-severe HFs (≥ 5 daily or ≥ 35 weekly) to receive 54.4 mg standardized soy isoflavones (including 24.5 mg genistein and 16.3 mg daidzein), 100 µg 8-PN, and 1 mg melatonin once daily for 12 weeks. The primary clinical outcomes included changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores (Menopause-Specific QoL questionnaire [MENQoL] and Cervantes Scale) and HFs following 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. Other analyses included treatment adherence, acceptability, tolerability, and safety. RESULTS: All of the four domains of MENQoL questionnaire significantly improved at 4 weeks (P < 0.05) and 12 weeks (P < 0.001), affecting significantly the vasomotor, psychosocial, and physical spheres (41.2%, 26.3%, and 25.0%; 12 weeks improvements, respectively). Similarly, in the menopause (39.3%) and psychic (51.7%) domains (both P < 0.05 at 12 weeks), the global score of the Cervantes Scale significantly increased at 4 weeks (18.6%) and 12 weeks (35.4%). Accordingly, moderate-to-severe HFs significantly decreased at 4 weeks compared to baseline (41.7% reduction) and further reduced at 12 weeks (76.5%), including the total number of episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Food supplements containing soy isoflavones, 8-PN, and melatonin showed an early and progressive benefit for reducing clinically significant HFs and for improving HRQoL across all domains, favorably affecting postmenopausal women's overall well-being."

In recent years, research has focused on identifying potential lifestyle dietary interventions that may prevent or treat NAFLD in this population. Due to the complex and multifactorial nature of NAFLD in postmenopausal women, the disease can present as different subtypes, with varying levels of clinical presentation and variable treatment responses. By recognizing the significant heterogeneity of NAFLD in postmenopausal women, it may be possible to identify specific subsets of individuals who may benefit from targeted nutritional interventions. The purpose of this review was to examine the current evidence supporting the role of three specific nutritional factors-choline, soy isoflavones, and probiotics-as potential nutritional adjuvants in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD in postmenopausal women. There is promising evidence supporting the potential benefits of these nutritional factors for NAFLD prevention and treatment, particularly in postmenopausal women, and further research is warranted to confirm their effectiveness in alleviating hepatic steatosis in this population.",

Isoflavones are intensively metabolized by the gut microbiota leading to metabolites with altered estrogenic potency. The population is classified into different isoflavone metabotypes based on individual metabolite profiles. So far, this classification was based on the capacity to metabolize daidzein and did not reflect genistein metabolism. We investigated the microbial metabolite profile of isoflavones considering daidzein and genistein. METHODS: Isoflavones and metabolites were quantified in the urine of postmenopausal women receiving a soy isoflavone extract for 12 weeks. Based on these data, women were clustered in different isoflavone metabotypes. Further, the estrogenic potency of these metabotypes was estimated. RESULTS: Based on the excreted urinary amounts of isoflavones and metabolites, the metabolite profiles could be calculated, resulting in 5 metabotypes applying a hierarchical cluster analysis. The metabotypes differed in part strongly regarding their metabolite profile and their estimated estrogenic potency.",

      "abstract": "Curcumin (CUR) and soy isoflavones (SIs) are two plant-based polyphenols that have attracted much attention, because of their extensive anticancer and health maintenance effects. However, the relevant molecular mechanisms are still uncertain. Genomic instability (GIN) refers to a combination of gene abnormal amplification, sequence deletion, ectopic, and other types of gene damage in cells, and it is one of the main factors causing cells to lose normal physiological functions. Therefore, we used the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay as the main research method to analyze the effects of CUR and SIs on the GIN of human normal colon cells NCM460 and colon cancer cells SW620. Results show that CUR (12.5 μM) could reduce the apoptosis of NCM460 and maintain its genomic stability while inhibiting the proliferation of SW620 and promoting its apoptosis. There was no difference in the promoting effect of GIN between SW620 and NCM460 using SIs (3.125-50 μM). When the two polyphenols (v/v = 1/1, 1.5625-6.25 μM) were mixed, they could promote the proliferation and GIN of the NCM460 and SW620 cells, but we did not find that combining the two produced a better effect on the cells. In conclusion, CUR has more prominent health and anticancer effects, and it may become a dietary recommendation for daily health maintenance and a potential adjuvant drug for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between intake of soy food and isoflavone with ovarian reserve. Previous studies suggest on the relationship between soy intake and human fertility are inconsistent. Some clinical studies suggest that soy and phytoestrogens may not be deleterious to reproduction and may even be beneficial in couples undergoing infertility treatment. However, no studies have evaluated the relationship between soy or isoflavone intake with markers of ovarian reserve other than follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: An academic fertility center. PATIENT(S): Patients presenting to an academic fertility center between 2007 and 2019 were invited to participate in the Environment and Reproductive Health Study. INTERVENTION(S): Six hundred and sixty seven participants reported their soy food intake and had an antral follicle count (AFC) assessment. Intake of 15 soy-based foods during the previous 3 months was obtained at baseline and intake of isoflavone was estimated. Participants were divided into 5 groups based on soy food and isoflavone intake considering those who did not consume soy as the reference group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ovarian reserve was assessed using AFC as the primary outcome measure, with antimüllerian hormone (AMH) and FSH as secondary outcome measures. The AFC was measured on the third day of the menstrual cycle. Moreover, FSH and AMH levels were measured in blood samples obtained on the third day and the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. To evaluate the association between soy intake and ovarian reserve, we used Poisson regression models for AFC and quantile regression models for AMH and day 3 FSH levels by adjusting for confounders. RESULT(S): Participants had a median age of 35.0 years. The median intake of soy was 0.09 servings/day and isoflavones was 1.78 mg/day. Moreover, AFC, AMH, and FSH were unrelated to soy intake in crude analyses. We found no association between soy food intake with AFC or day 3 FSH level in multivariable models. However, participants in the highest category of soy food intake had significantly low AMH levels (-1.16, 95% confidence interval: -1.92, -0.41). Soy intake had no association with AFC, AMH, or FSH in sensitivity analyses that included using different cutoff points of soy intake, excluding participants in the highest 2.5 percentile of intake, and additional statistical adjustment for dietary patterns. CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study are not consistent with a strong positive or inverse association of soy or isoflavone intakes within the observed range of intake, which substantially overlaps with that in the general population of the United States as well as the ovarian reserve among individuals presenting to fertility centers.",

In this work, the interaction between isoflavone glucosides and G-tetrads, namely [4G+Na]+ ions (G stands for guanosine or deoxyguanosine), were analyzed by using electrospray ionization-collision induced dissociation-mass spectrometry (ESI-CID-MS) and survival yields method. The strength of isoflavone glucosides-[4G+Na]+ interaction in the gas phase was determined from Ecom50 - the energy required to fragment 50 % of selected precursor ions.

The effect size was computed by the mean changes from the beginning for intervention and comparison groups and their standard deviation. In the case of significant heterogeneity, DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used. Six and five clinical trials were selected for the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. The overall estimate indicated that soy isoflavones in combination with soy protein did not significantly change serum adiponectin level (weighted mean differences (WMD) = 0.36 μg/ml; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.26, 0.99; p = .25), but significantly increased serum resistin level (WMD = 0.64 ng/ml, 95% CI: 0.25, 1.04; p = .001). In combination with soy protein, soy isoflavones nonsignificantly increased serum adiponectin levels, but significantly increased resistin levels. New intervention studies with a high dose of soy isoflavones and soy protein in different parts of the world and an updated meta-analysis are needed to confirm the results of our study."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Populations consuming soy have reduced risk for breast cancer, but the mechanisms are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that soy isoflavones, which have ovarian hormone-like effects, can reduce fibroglandular breast tissue (FGBT, 'breast density'), a strong risk marker for breast cancer. METHODS: Premenopausal women (age 30-42 years) were randomized to consume isoflavones (136.6 mg as aglycone equivalents, n = 99) or placebo (n = 98) for 5 days per week up to 2 years, and changes in breast composition measured by magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and yearly intervals were compared after square root transformation using linear mixed effects regression models. RESULTS: By intention-to-treat analyses (n = 194), regression coefficients (β estimates) of the interaction of time and isoflavone treatment were -0.238 (P = 0.06) and -0.258 (P < 0.05) before and after BMI adjustment, respectively for FGBT, 0.620 (P < 0.05) and 0.248 (P = 0.160), respectively for fatty breast tissue (FBT), and -0.155 (P < 0.05) and -0.107 (P < 0.05), respectively for FGBT as percent of total breast (FGBT%). β Estimates for interaction of treatment with serum calcium were -2.705 for FBT, and 0.588 for FGBT% (P < 0.05, before but not after BMI adjustment). BMI (not transformed) was related to the interaction of treatment with time (β = 0.298) or with calcium (β = -1.248) (P < 0.05). Urinary excretion of isoflavones in adherent subjects (n = 135) significantly predicted these changes in breast composition. Based on the modeling results, after an average of 1.2, 2.2 and 3.3 years of supplementation, a mean decrease of FGBT by 5.3, 12.1, and 19.3 cc, respectively, and a mean decrease of FGBT% by 1.37, 2.43, and 3.50%, respectively, were estimated for isoflavone exposure compared to placebo treatment. Subjects with maximum isoflavone excretion were estimated to have 38 cc less FGBT (or ∼3.13% less FGBT%) than subjects without isoflavone excretion. Decrease in FGBT and FGBT% was more precise with daidzein than genistein. CONCLUSIONS: Soy isoflavones can induce a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in FGBT, a biomarker for breast cancer risk, in premenopausal women, and moderate effects of calcium on BMI and breast fat, suggesting a beneficial effect of soy consumption.

      "abstract": "Bone remodels via resorption and formation, two phenomena that continuously occur in bone turnover. The RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway is one of the several mechanisms that affect bone turnover. The RANKL/OPG ratio has a substantial role in bone resorption. An imbalance between formation and resorption is related to an increased RANKL/OPG balance. OPG, a member of this system, can bind to RANKL and suppress RANK-RANKL interaction, and subsequently, inhibit further osteoclastogenesis. The serum levels of RANKL and OPG in the bone microenvironment are vital for osteoclasts formation. The RANK/RANKL/OPG system plays a role in the pathogenesis of bone disorders. This system can be considered a new treatment target for bone disorders. Soy isoflavones affect the RANK/RANKL/OPG system through numerous mechanisms. Soy isoflavones decrease RANKL levels and increase OPG levels. Therefore, isoflavones improve bone metabolism and decrease bone resorption. Soy isoflavones decrease serum markers of bone resorption and improve bone metabolism. However, while the available data are promising, the results of several studies reported no change in RANKL and OPG levels with isoflavones supplementation. In this regard, current evidence is insufficient for conclusive approval of the efficacy of isoflavones on RANKL/RANK/OPG and further research, including animal and human studies, are needed to confirm the effect of soy isoflavones on the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway. This study was a review of available evidence to determine the role of isoflavones in bone hemostasis and the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. The identification of the effects of isoflavones on the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway directs future studies and leads to the development of effective treatment strategies for bone disorders.",

MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles published in English during 1995-2019. Studies were identified and reviewed for inclusion and exclusion eligibility. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for each study and were pooled by using the random effects model. Eighteen randomized controlled trials were selected for meta-analysis. Different types of soy phytoestrogens, i.e., genistein extracts, soy isoflavones extracts, soy protein isolate, and foods containing diverse amounts of isoflavones were used in the studies. The analysis showed that daily intake of 106 (range, 40-300) mg of isoflavones for 6-24 months moderately but statistically significantly positively affects BMD, compared with controls: lumbar spine WMD = 1.63 (95% CI: 0.51 to 2.75)%, p = 0004; femoral neck WMD = 1.87 (95% CI: 0.14 to 3.60)%, p = 0.034; and total hip WMD = 0.39 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.69)%, p = 0.013. Subgroups analyses indicated that the varying effects of isoflavones on BMD across the trials might be associated with intervention duration, racial diversity (Caucasian, Asian), time after menopause, form of supplements (especially genistein), and dose of isoflavones. Our review and meta-analysis suggest that soy isoflavones are effective in slowing down bone loss after menopause."

      "abstract": "The role of dietary factors in osteoporotic fractures (OFs) in women is not fully elucidated. We investigated the associations between incidence of OF and dietary calcium, magnesium and soy isoflavone intake in a longitudinal study of 48 584 postmenopausal women. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to derive hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate associations between dietary intake, based on the averages of two assessments that took place with a median interval of 2⋅4 years, and fracture risk. The average age of study participants is 61⋅4 years (range 43⋅3-76⋅7 years) at study entry. During a median follow-up of 10⋅1 years, 4⋅3 % participants experienced OF. Compared with daily calcium intake ≤400 mg/d, higher calcium intake (>400 mg/d) was significantly associated with about a 40-50 % reduction of OF risk among women with a calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg) intake ratio ≥1⋅7. Among women with prior fracture history, high soy isoflavone intake was associated with reduced OF risk; the HR was 0⋅72 (95 % CI 0⋅55, 0⋅93) for the highest (>42⋅0 mg/d) v. lowest (<18⋅7 mg/d) quartile intake. This inverse association was more evident among recently menopausal women (<10 years). No significant association between magnesium intake and OF risk was observed. Our findings provide novel information suggesting that the association of OF risk with dietary calcium intake was modified by Ca/Mg ratio, and soy isoflavone intake was modified by history of fractures and time since menopause. Our findings, if confirmed, can help to guide further dietary intervention strategies for OF prevention.",

However, the effect of soy isoflavones on migraine characteristic remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of soy isoflavones on migraine characteristics and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels in women with migraine. METHODS: Eighty-three participants completed a randomized double-blind controlled trial, receiving 50 mg per day soy isoflavones or placebo supplementation for 8 weeks. Migraine severity, migraine days per month, frequency and duration of attacks, mental status, quality of life and serum CGRP levels were measured at baseline and the end of the intervention. Bivariate comparison and intention-to-treat (ITT) were used for analysis. RESULTS: Soy isoflavones intake resulted in a significant decrease in mean frequency (-2.36 vs -0.43, P < 0.001), duration (-2.50 vs -0.02, P < 0.001) of migraine attacks and CGRP level (-12.18 ng/l vs -8.62, P = 0.002) in compared to placebo group. Also, a significant improvement was found in quality of life (16.76 vs 2.52, P < 0.001). Although, reduction in the migraine severity and mental status did not reach a statistically significant level (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: soy isoflavones supplementation may be considered as a complementary treatment for women with migraine to improve migraine characteristics and reduce the burden of disease.",

The aim of present study is to assess the effect of soy isoflavones plus soy protein on serum concentration of leptin among adults. METHODS: To find randomized clinical trails (RCTs) assessing the effect of soy isoflavones containing soy protein on serum concentration of leptin in participants with age ≥18 years old, databases including PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to March 2021. We calculated the effect size by the mean change from baseline of leptin concentrations and its standard deviation for intervention and comparison groups. DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was used to estimate the overall summary effect and the heterogeneity. Risk of bias was conducted by Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (No. CRD42021228366). RESULTS: Eight articles with 421 participants and six articles with 336 participants were known to be eligible for systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. A pooled analysis revealed that the combination of soy isoflavones and soy protein had a borderline non-significant on serum concentration of leptin (weighted mean difference (WMD): -1.03 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.11, 0.05 ng/ml). This combination reduced serum leptin levels in studies with baseline levels of leptin ≤22 ng/ml, in short-term trials (≤56 days), studies that used soy isoflavones with dose ≤96 mg/day and among subjects with health risk factors or diseases. CONCLUSION: Soy isoflavones plus soy protein had a non-significant decreasing effect on the serum concentration of leptin. However, making firm conclusion needs more studies on participants with different health condition, and different soy isoflavones doses and intervention duration.",

These isoflavones generally have low solubility resulting in low bioavailability and bioactivity. It is reported that trans-glycosylation by cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) is widely utilized for increasing the solubility and bioavailability of isoflavones. Present investigation was aimed to study the effect of Bacillus coagulans (a probiotic) in potentiating the bioactivity of soy isoflavones in letrozole-induced PCOS. Initial consideration was focused on proving CGTase assay of B. coagulans. After that, animal study was performed to check the enhancement of bioactivity of SIF along with B. coagulans. A total of 36 rats, separated into six groups (6 rats in each), were used. Group I received vehicles, group II received letrozole (1 mg/kg) for 21 days, and group III animals were administered with soy isoflavones (SIF-100 mg/kg). In the case of group IV, V, and VI, animals received SIF (100 mg/kg) along with B. coagulans 0.65, 3.25, and 6.50 mg/kg, respectively. Treatment was given for 2 weeks after induction of disease. All the animals were sacrificed at the end of the study and endpoint parameters were performed. Present investigation revealed that combination of SIF with B. coagulans showed hormone restoration, reduce oxidative stress, recovery in the menstrual cycle, and improvement in ovarian physiology. SIF (genistein & daidzein) together with B. coagulans exhibits a beneficial role in the enhancement of the bioactivity of soy isoflavones. Further, it showed that a higher dose of B. coagulans (6.50 mg/kg) is more effective in ameliorating the PCOS symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that there is a close association between chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) and cognitive deficits. The animal model of CSD-induced cognitive deficits is commonly used to seek potential treatments. Soy isoflavones (SI) have been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and neuroprotective effects. In the present study, the effects of SI on CSD-induced memory impairment were investigated. The mice were subjected to the sleep interruption apparatus and continuously sleep deprived for 2 weeks, while orally administrated with SI (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) or Modafinil (MOD,100 mg/kg) during the CSD process. Immediately after the SD protocol, cognitive performance of mice was evaluated by the object location recognition (OLR) test, the novel object recognition (NOR) test, and the Morris water maze (MWM) task, as well as the hippocampus, was extracted for evaluation of oxidative stress parameters and inflammation levels through biochemical parameter assay and western blotting analysis. The results showed that SI administration remarkably improved the cognitive performance of CSD-treated mice in OLR, NOR, and MWM tests. In addition, SI significantly elevated total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase enzyme activities, decreased malondialdehyde level, promoting antioxidant element nuclear erythroid-2-related factor 2, and its downstream targets, including heme oxygenase 1, and quinone oxidoreductase 1 protein expressions. Moreover, SI treatment significantly suppressed nuclear factor kappa B p65, nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase 2 activation, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and interleukin-1β [IL-1β]) release in the hippocampus of CSD-treated mice. In summary, the current study provides an insight into the potential of SI in treatment of cognitive deficits by CSD.",

      "abstract": "Soy isoflavones have been suggested as an alternative treatment for managing postmenopausal symptoms and promoting long-term health due to their structural similarity to mammalian estrogen and ability to bind to estrogen receptors. Among all soy isoflavones and their metabolites, (S)-equol is known for having the strongest estrogenic activity. Equol is a metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein produced through intestinal bacterial metabolism. However, more than half of the human population is not able to produce equol due to the lack of equol-producing bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract. The interpersonal variations in the gut microbiome complicate the interpretation of data collected from humans. Furthermore, because rodents are efficient equol-producers, translatability between rodent models and humans is challenging. Herein, we first summarized the current knowledge of the microbial conversion of daidzein to equol, its relation to health, and proposed the need for developing model systems by which equol production can be manipulated while controlling other known confounding factors. Determining the necessity of equol-producing capacity within a gut microbial community when consuming soy as a functional ingredient, and identifying strategies to maximize equol production by modulating the gut microbiome, may provide future therapeutic approaches to improve the health of postmenopausal women.",

BACKGROUND: The progression of periodontitis is affected by host factors, such as smoking, diabetes mellitus, and steroid use. Bone loss in periodontitis can be aggravated by ED. METHODS: A rat model of experimental periodontitis (EP) with ED was established by silk ligature and inoculation with Porphyromonas gingivalis, and some EP rats were subjected to bilateral ovariectomy (OVX). The treatment groups received an intravenous injection of 17-β-estradiol (E2 B) or soy isoflavones (SI) by gavage. The rats were euthanized, and the maxillary jaws, gingiva, and serum were harvested. Tight junction protein and interleukin (IL)-17 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and periodontal destruction were assessed. In addition, we determined whether grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) is required for enhancing the epithelial barrier by SI in an in vitro P. gingivalis infection model. RESULTS: Estrogen deficiency impaired the expression of genes encoding tight junction proteins in the gingiva, increased IL-17 level, and accelerated alveolar bone resorption. SI treatment alleviated tight junction protein expression, decreased IL-17 and ROS levels, and prevented the absorption of alveolar bone. Furthermore, GRHL2 expression was significantly induced by SI in human oral keratinocytes-1 (HOK-1) cells; GRHL2 knockdown impaired the expression of OCLN and ZO-1 induced by SI treatment. CONCLUSION: Soy isoflavones alleviates periodontitis in OVX rats, as observed by the increased expression of tight junction proteins, and reduced IL-17 level and alveolar bone loss. The in vitro studies suggested that the enhancement of oral epithelial barrier by SI treatment was partially dependent on GRHL2.",

In addition, on day 10 of lactation, linear increases in serum superoxide dismutase levels, linear and quadratic increases in serum total antioxidant capacity, and linear decreases in serum malondialdehyde levels were observed in increasing ISO dosage in the diet of sows. The body weight on day 10 and 21 and the average daily gain during days 3-10 and 3-21 of offspring increased linearly at graduated doses of ISO increased.

Recently, various dietary interventions have been used extensively as a novel therapy against PCOS. In the present study, we show that soy isoflavone metabolites and resistant starch, together with gut microbiota modulations, were successful in decreasing the severity of PCOS-like reproductive features while increasing the expression of gut barrier markers and butyric acid in the gut. In the letrozole-induced PCOS model rats, the intake of both 0.05% soy isoflavones and 11% resistant starch, even with letrozole treatment, reduced the severity of menstrual irregularity and polycystic ovaries with a high concentration of soy isoflavones and equol in plasma. Antibiotic cocktail treatment suppressed soy isoflavone metabolism in the gut and showed no considerable effects on reducing the PCOS-like symptoms. The mRNA expression level of occludin significantly increased with soy isoflavone and resistant starch combined treatment. Bacterial genera such as Blautia, Dorea and Clostridium were positively correlated with menstrual irregularity under resistant starch intake. Moreover, the concentration of butyric acid was elevated by resistant starch intake. In conclusion, we propose that both dietary interventions and gut microbiota modulations could be effectively used in reducing the severity of PCOS reproductive features.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Phytoestrogens are traditionally used for cardiovascular risks but direct effects on the ischemic heart remain unclear. Plants with phytoestrogens are used for reducing menopausic symptoms and they could also be cardioprotectives. Here we investigated whether maca (Lepidium meyenii) contains isoflavones and prevents cardiac stunning, in comparison to soy isoflavones. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Both products were orally and daily administered to rats during 1 week before exposing isolated hearts to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Young male (YM), female (YF) and aged female (AgF) rats treated with maca (MACA, 1 g/kg/day) or soy isoflavones (ISOF, 100 mg/kg/day) were compared to acute daidzein (DAZ, 5 mg/kg i.p.) and non-treated rat groups. Isolated ventricles were perfused inside a calorimeter to simultaneously measure contractile and calorimetrical signals before and during I/R. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Maca has genistein and daidzein. MACA and ISOF improved the post-ischemic contractile recovery (PICR) and muscle economy (P/Ht) in YM and YF hearts, but not in AgF hearts. DAZ improved PICR and P/Ht more in YM than in YF. The mKATP channels blockade reduced both PICR and P/Ht in DAZ-treated YM hearts, without affecting them in ISOF or MACA-treated YM hearts. In MACA treated YF hearts, the simultaneous blockade of NOS and mKATP channels, or the mNCX blockade reduced cardioprotection. Results show that subacute oral treatment with maca or with soy isoflavones was strongly preventive of cardiac ischemic dysfunction, more than the acute administration of a pure isoflavone (daidzein, genistein). Maca induced synergistic and complex mechanisms which prevented mitochondrial calcium overload."

      "abstract": "Soy isoflavones have been widely used in the treatment of clinical gynecological diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect and molecular mechanism of Soy isoflavones on rats with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered 1 mg/kg letrozole for 21 consecutive days to induce the PCOS rat model. After PCOS induction, Soy isoflavones (100 mg/kg) or metformin (Positive control; 500 mg/kg) was administered continuously for 28 days. Then, H&E staining was used to observe the pathological changes of ovary. The serum hormone levels and the levels of antioxidant and inflammatory cytokines in ovarian tissue were detected. Additionally, the expression of NF-κB signaling pathway protein was detected by Western blot. Our results showed that soy isoflavones treatment significantly reduced the body weight, ovarian volume and weight, and improved estrous cycle in PCOS rats. H&E staining showed that the number of cystic dilated follicles and atretic follicles in ovarian tissue diminished, showing healthy follicles and corpus luteum. In addition, soy isoflavones treatment markedly decreased serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, as well as oxidative stress levels and inflammation levels, and increased estradiol (E2) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. At the same time, Soy isoflavones treatment inhibit the phosphorylation level of NF-κB p65 and increased the IκBα expression in ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. Overall, Soy isoflavones can improve ovarian morphology and hormone disorders in PCOS rats by inhibiting the activity of NF-κB pathway and enhancing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity.",

The study was planned to examine the effect of various levels of SI on nutrient intake, digestibility, lipid profile, insulin, and reproductive hormones of estradiol valerate (4 mg/rat/IM) PCOS induced rat models. Thirty-six Wistar 45 days old rats weighing 95 ± 5 g were divided into 4 groups, each having 9 rats: C (control: without SF), SF10 (SF 0.10 g/kg BW), SF15 (SF 0.15 g/kg BW), and SF20 (SF 0.20 g/kg BW). SF was given through the oral gavage. Food and water were offered ad libitum, and intake was recorded daily. During last week of trial, collected feces by total collection method and blood samples were used to calculate nutrient digestibility and biochemical analysis, respectively. Estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin were (p < .05) high in rats fed SF diet that was 4% and 30% increase from C, respectively. Insulin, testosterone, FSH, and LH were lowest in rats fed diet SF20. Significant (p < .05) reduction in cholesterol was observed in rats fed SF15 and SF20 as compared to C. Serum HDL was improved (p < .05) in all SIF0.10, SIF0.15, and SIF0.20 in comparison with PC. Serum LDL was significantly reduced to 68.89 ± 4.36 (mg/dl) in SIF0.20 and to 108.20 ± 4.14 (mg/dl) in SIF0.15, whereas insignificant reduction was observed in SIF0.10 as compared to PC. Highly significant reduction was noted in triglycerides level in SIF0.20; however, significant reduction was observed in both SIF0.10 and SIF0.15 as compared to PC after 3 months of treatment with soy isoflavones."

In this study, we attempted to summarize the effect of soy protein combined with soy isoflavones on circulating E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in adults. METHODS: Clinicaltrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for English articles with no time limit regarding publication up to December 2020. Thereafter, the mean changes from baseline and their standard deviations (SDs) for both intervention and comparison groups were used to calculate the effect size. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model if the heterogeneity test was statistically significant. Cochran's Q test and I-squared statistic were also used to calculate the statistical heterogeneity of the intervention effects. RESULTS: Eight articles were found as eligible for this study. The treatment duration was between 6 and 24 weeks. Soy isoflavones dose was in a range of 30-112 mg/day and soy protein dose was in a range of 11.25-52 g/day. Overall, taking soy protein supplements containing soy isoflavones was not associated with changes in cell adhesion molecules, E-selectin, ICAM-1, or VCAM-1 (WMD = 0.65, 95 % CI: -2.58, 3.89; p = 0.692; WMD = 2.68, 95 % CI: -0.98, 6.34; p = 0.151; WMD = 2.66, 95 % CI: -6.28, 11.61; p = 0.559, respectively). CONCLUSION: The combination of soy protein and soy isoflavones was not significantly associated with changes in levels of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1.

Wistar rats raised in small litters (SL, three pups/dam) and normal litters (NL, nine pups/dam) were used as models of early overfeeding and normal feeding, respectively. At 30 to 90 days old, animals in the SL and NL groups received either soy isoflavones extract (ISO) or water (W) gavage serving as controls. At 90 days old, body weight, visceral fat deposits, glycemia, insulinemia were evaluated. Glucose-insulin homeostasis and pancreatic-islet insulinotropic response were also determined. The early life overnutrition induced by small litter displayed metabolic dysfunction, glucose, and insulin homeostasis disruption in adult rats. However, adult SL rats treated with soy isoflavones showed improvement in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulinemia, fat tissue accretion, and body weight gain, compared with the SL-W group. Pancreatic-islet response to cholinergic, adrenergic, and glucose stimuli was improved in both isoflavone-treated groups. In addition, different isoflavone concentrations increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets of all groups with higher magnitude in both NL and SL isoflavone-treated groups. These results indicate that long-term treatment with soy isoflavones inhibits early overfeeding-induced metabolic dysfunction in adult rats and modulated the process of insulin secretion in pancreatic islets.",

PubMed (Medline) and EMBASE were searched for relevant studies, and their quality was evaluated according to Cochrane criteria. The levels of markers were evaluated in a total of 1114 women who ingested mean daily doses of 98.2 mg (30.9 to 300) of soy isoflavones for 3 to 24 months, in comparison to those of 1081 subjects who used a placebo. Ten, eighteen, eight, and fourteen comparison studies were finally selected for an estimation of the effects on osteocalcin (OC), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), pyridinoline (PYD), and deoxypyridinoline (DPD), respectively. A summary of the results of intervention was as follows: 4.16%, 95% CI: -7.72-16.04, p = 0.49 for OC; 5.50%, 95% CI: -3.81-14.82, p = 0.25 for BAP; -12.09%, 95% CI: -25.37-1.20, p = 0.07 for PYD; and -7.48%, 95% CI: -15.37-0.41, p = 0.06 for DPD. The meta-analysis of the included studies revealed some statistically insignificant observations that soy isoflavones intake is associated with a trend in increased levels of OC and BAP, as well as a trend in reduced levels of PYD and DPD.

      "abstract": "Systemic injection with lipopolysaccharide can lead to depressive-like behavior in experimental animals by inducing neuroinflammation and is considered to be a classic model of depression. S-equol is a major metabolite of dietary soy isoflavones with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and it has many beneficial effects on human health, including alleviation of menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, cancer, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive dysfunction. A recent study reported that S-equol inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neuroinflammation in astrocytes. However, there is no research on the antidepressant-like effects of S-equol. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of S-equol in a lipopolysaccharide-induced depression model in mice and explore its underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that treatment with S-equol (10, 20 and 40 mg kg-1) for 19 days markedly reversed the behavior of acute LPS (1.0 mg kg-1) treated mice in sucrose preference, tail suspension and forced swimming tests, exerting antidepressant-like effects. In addition, S-equol administration significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-1β), increased the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine, and normalized the release of tryptophan and kynurenine in the hippocampi of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with S-equol significantly up-regulated the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins (phospho synapsin, synapsin, postsynaptic density-95) and down-regulated the toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway in the hippocampi of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. These findings demonstrated that S-equol significantly alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by acute systemic injection of LPS, and its antidepressant action was related to mediation of neuroinflammation via the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, normalization of the monoamine neurotransmitter levels, reversal of tryptophan metabolism dysfunction, and enhancement of synaptic plasticity. The current study provides insight into the potential of S-equol in the prevention of depression.",

Thus, the present study aims at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the effect of soy isoflavones and the combination of soy isoflavones and soy protein on serum concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) among postmenopausal women is assessed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A literature searching was done to identify a breadth of related references in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov up to December 2020. The mean change from baseline in the CRP concentrations and its standard deviation (SD) for both intervention and comparison groups were used to calculate the effect size. The summary of the overall effects and heterogeneity was estimated by using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (No. CRD42020166053). RESULTS: This study considered 23 articles for systematic review and 19 articles for meta-analysis. The overall effect presented a non-significant effect of soy isoflavones on serum CRP concentrations (WMD = 0.08 mg/L, 95 % CI: -0.08, 0.24; p = 0.302) and the overall effect of the combination of soy isoflavones and soy protein indicated non-significant effect in serum levels of CRP (WMD= -0.02 mg/L 95 % CI: -0.12, 0.08; p = 0.715).

We systematically searched Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and clinicaltrials.gov for articles published up to May 2020. Effect size was calculated by mean change from baseline of TNF-α concentrations and its standard deviation (SD) for intervention and comparison groups. If the heterogeneity test was statistically significant, DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was used to estimate the summary of the overall effects and its heterogeneity. Nineteen and fourteen randomized clinical trials were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. The result of overall effect size indicated a non-significant effect in serum concentration of TNF-α following soy isoflavones intake (WMD = 0.2 pg/ml, 95% CI: -0.13, 0.53; p = .226) and the combination of soy isoflavones and soy protein intake (WMD = 0.02 pg/ml, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.06; p = .286). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant change in circulatory levels of TNF-α following soy isoflavones plus soy protein intake. In conclusion, the present systematic review and meta-analysis found insufficient evidence that soy isoflavones or the combination of soy isoflavones and soy protein significantly reduce serum concentration of TNF-α.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of resveratrol(Res) combined with soy isoflavones(SIF) on apoptosisinduced by oxidative stress in hippocampus in aging model rats. METHODS: Sixty female SD rats were randomly divided into the Sham control group, aging model group, Res treatment group, SIF treatment group, Res combined with SIF treatment group and estrogen replacement therapy group(ERT group). Rats with aging were induced by bilateral ovariectomy combined with intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose. TUNEL and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe apoptosis and ultrastructural changes of mitochondrion in hippocampus, respectively. The activities of superoxide dismutase(SOD), catalase(CAT), glutathione peroxidase(GSH-Px) and content of Malonaldehyde(MDA) were detected in the hippocampal homogenate. The protein expressions of cytochrome C oxidase(COX) Ⅰ, Bcl-2 associated X protein(Bax)、B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2(Bcl-2) and cytochrome C were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the Sham control group, the number of TUNEL-positive cells and the apoptotic index(AI) in the model group increased. Marked increase of mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation, decrease of mitochondrial integrity were also observed in the model group. Additionally, the levels of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px were decreased and the level of MDA was increased in the model group in the hippocampus, Bax and cytochrome C protein expression increased, and the COX Ⅰ protein expression and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax decreased(P&lt;0. 05). In compared with the model group, the number of TUNEL-positive cells and AI significantly decreased, mitochondrial integrity improved in all of the treatment groups, the COX Ⅰ protein expression significantly up-regulated, Bax and cytochrome C protein expression down-regulated, and the protein expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax increased(P&lt;0. 05 or P&lt;0. 01). Compared with the Res alone and SIF alone treatment group, Res combined SIF treatment decreased the AI and Bax, cytochrome C protein expression, moreover, increased the mitochondrial integrity rate, COX Ⅰ and Bcl-2/Bax protein expression ratio(P&lt;0. 05). There was no statistically significant difference in Bcl-2 protein expression among all the groups(P&gt;0. 05). CONCLUSION: Res and SIF alone and in combination decreased apoptosisinduced by oxidative stress in hippocampus of aging model rats, and beneficial effect in the Res combined SIF treatment group is more significant than that in the alone administration. Improving the antioxidant capacity, increasing the protein expressions of COX Ⅰ andthe ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax, and inhibiting the release of cytochrome C may be the mechanisms by which Res and SIF improve apoptosis in aging rats.",

      "abstract": "Soy isoflavones (SIF) are soybean phytochemicals that are considered to be biologically active components that protect from neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the therapeutic effect of SIF was evaluated in a diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model. Twenty male GK rats were randomly divided into diabetes mellitus (DM) model group and SIF+DM group (n=10 in each group). Twenty age-matched male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group (CON group) and CON+SIF group, with 10 rats in each group. The learning and memory functions of the animals were determined by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) was performed to examine pyramidal neuron loss in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Markers of oxidative stress (OS) were measured to evaluate oxidative stress-mediated injury. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to analyze the expression of nuclear factorerythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone1 (NQO1). Treatment with SIF for 4 weeks alleviated the cognitive dysfunction of the GK rats as determined by the MWM test. Moreover, SIF treatment also reduced diabetes-related oxidative reactions. In addition, SIF enhanced the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1, suggesting a potential antioxidation mechanism for the effect of SIF. These findings suggest that SIF can be considered candidates for inhibiting the progression of diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction, provide novel insights into the antioxidant effect of SIF and further strengthen the link between oxidative stress and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Chronic ethanol intake can lead to dementia by activating neuroinflammation, causing oxidative stress response, reducing cholinergic function and inducing neuronal apoptosis. Soy isoflavones (SIs) exert beneficial effects in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders by acting on the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic and neuro-trophic processes. However, at present, it is unknown whether SIs have a neuroprotective effect in chronic ethanol-induced dementia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of SI on chronic ethanol-induced cognitive deficit in mice and explore the underlying mechanisms. The cognition-impaired mouse model was induced by ethanol (2.0 g kg-1, p.o) for 4 weeks. SIs (10, 20 or 40 mg kg-1, p.o) were delivered 1 hour after ethanol administration for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) test and the passive avoidance (PA) task were conducted to evaluate the learning and memory abilities. After the behavioral tests, the biochemical parameter assay and western blot analysis were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of its action. SI administration significantly improved the cognitive performance in the MWM and PA tests, regulated the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and acetylcholine (Ach) level, elevated the synaptic plasticity-related protein expressions and inhibited neuron apoptosis-related protein expressions in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. The results revealed that soy isoflavones may provide a possible novel candidate for the prevention and treatment of alcoholic dementia.",

The mean change from baseline of IL-6 concentrations and its SD for intervention and comparison groups were used to calculate the effect size.

Our meta-analysis results indicated a non-significant effect in serum IL-6 concentrations compared to the comparison group (WMD = 0.03 pg/ml, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.12; p = .459). In subgroup analysis, based on soy isoflavones dosage, it was observed that this combination could reduce IL-6 levels in studies that used isoflavones with dose >84 mg/day (WMD = -0.12 pg/ml 95% CI: -0.24, -0.004; p = .042, I2 = 82.7%) and in articles with a good quality (WMD = -0.15 pg/ml 95% CI: -0.24, -0.05; p = .003, I2 = 62.3%).

When hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated, it is necessary to provide alternative treatments. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to observe the effects of an herbal remedy from pollen extracts and soy isoflavones for menopausal complaints, particularly on sleep disorders. METHODS: A six-month prospective observational study was performed in women in natural menopause suffering from menopausal symptoms and sleep disturbances. Three groups were compared: 57 women receiving two tablets/ day containing herbal remedy from pollen extracts (group A), 60 women receiving one tablet/day containing isoflavones 60 mg (group B), 47 women not receiving any treatment (group C). At 3 (T3) and 6 months (T6), the daily number of hot-flushes, Kupperman index for menopausal symptoms, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) test were assessed. RESULTS: Both groups A and B showed a significant improvement of hot flushes (p<0.001) and Kuppermann Index (p<0.001) from T0 to T3 and from T0 to T6. No significant differences between treatment groups were found at T3, while at T6 group A showed greater decrease of daily hot flashes and better improvement of Kupperman Index as compared to group B (respectively, -48.8% versus -18.4% and -24.4% versus -15.4%; p<0.001). Improvement of global sleep quality was more evident in the pollen treated group compared to isoflavones group at both three (-24.7% versus -9.3%, p<0.001) and six (-52.9% vs -4.0%; p<0.001) months, mainly for the scores related to subjective sleep quality, sleep latency and habitual sleep efficiency. CONCLUSION: Non-hormonal treatments can effectively be used in symptomatic menopausal women: among these, after six months of treatment, pollen extracts might achieve a better improvement of hot flushes, sleep disturbances and menopause-related symptoms than soy isoflavones. Herbal remedy from pollen extracts is mainly effective when the quality of sleep is the most disturbing complaint.",

Our previous study found that estrogen receptor α (ERα) directly regulates the NLRP3 transcription and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Therefore, we hypothesized that SIFs alleviate colitis via an ERα-dependent mechanism by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. The influence of SIFs on colitis and the potential mechanisms were thoroughly determined in this study. The results suggested that SIFs ameliorated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced body weight loss, reduced disease activity index and promoted the recovery of colon pathological damage in mice. Moreover, expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly inhibited, and the release of IL-1β and IL-18 was suppressed by SIFs. Furthermore, ERα blockade ameliorated DSS-induced inflammatory responses in the intestine, and SIFs markedly suppressed the expression of ERα in a dose-dependent manner. Our study demonstrated that the protective therapeutic action of SIFs on DSS-induced colitis depended on inhibition of ERα and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and SIFs are promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of colitis.",

To test the hypothesis that supplementation of soy isoflavones reduces arterial stiffness, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of soy isoflavones on arterial stiffness. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019126128) and written in accordance with PRISMA. The PubMed, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched using the following criteria: human subjects, soy isoflavones as intervention, and arterial stiffness as primary outcome. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimates across studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to synthesize quantitative results. RESULTS: Among 998 articles retrieved, 8 articles met our criteria. Duration of intervention was relatively short (maximum of 12 weeks). Outcome measurements extracted were pulse wave velocity (PWV), systemic arterial compliance (SAC), augmentation index (AI), and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). Soy isoflavones reduced arterial stiffness compared to placebo (standardized mean difference - 0.33, 95% confidence interval - 0.47, - 0.19). Subgroup analyses showed no difference between treatment effects for intervention duration (< 6 weeks vs. ≥ 6 weeks) or gender (women only vs. men only vs. combined). Sensitivity analysis showed no difference in the effect of soy isoflavones between PWV, CAVI, SAC, and AI. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of soy isoflavones reduced arterial stiffness. Longer duration trials with larger number of participants are warranted.",

Therefore, this research was designed to investigate the effects of soy isoflavone supplement on serum lipids and Lp(a) in PD patients. METHODS & RESULTS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 40 PD patients were randomly assigned to either the isoflavone or the placebo group. The patients in the isoflavone group received 100 mg soy isoflavone daily for 8 weeks, whereas the placebo group received corresponding placebos. At baseline and the end of the 8th week, 7 mL of blood was obtained from each patient and serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and Lp(a) were measured. Serum Lp(a) reduced significantly up to 10% in the isoflavone group at the end of week 8 compared to baseline (P < 0.05), and the reduction was significant in comparison with the placebo group (P < 0.05). Serum HDL-C increased significantly up to 11.5% in the isoflavone group at the end of week 8 compared to baseline (P = 0.05), and the increment was significant in comparison with the placebo group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in mean changes of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-C. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that daily administration of 100 mg soy isoflavones reduces serum Lp(a) and increases HDL-C concentration which are two determinants of cardiovascular disease in PD patients.

Hypothalamus plays a very important role in the progression of obesity, and many studies reveal that hypothalamic injures are implicated in obesity processes. Here, we describe that the consumption of soy isoflavones, with a structural similarity to that of estradiol, could mitigate obesity through improving the hypothalamic inflammation and apoptosis, which are induced by oxidative stress. Also, our in vitro studies demonstrate that daidzein and genistein, common ingredients of soy isoflavones, could protect hypothalamic N42 cells against palmitic acid induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Moreover, the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1-alpha), which plays a role in oxidative defense, is increased after soy isoflavone treatment in vivo and in vitro, suggesting an improved effect of soy isoflavones on hypothalamic antioxidant defense is mediated by PGC-1α. Our study reveals a potential mechanism of soy isoflavones regulating oxidative stress induced hypothalamic inflammation and cellular apoptosis, which will be important for obesity treatment.",

In this review, we discuss the effects of soy isoflavones on the overall gut function and inflammation and assess how these effects might be implicated in the treatment of several gut-related diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Soy isoflavones influence several key aspects of gastrointestinal health: improve basal intestinal secretion, alleviate inflammation, limit intestinal morphological damage, and improve epithelial barrier function in several clinically relevant murine models of gastrointestinal diseases. Dietary supplementation with isoflavones proves to be a key means to improve the overall gut function and health. Future mechanistic studies with isoflavone interventions will help treat clinically related diseases such as cystic fibrosis and inflammatory-related gut problems such as colitis and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of resveratrol combined with soy isoflavones on avoidance memory, number of neuron-specific nuclear protein(NeuN) positive cells and expressions of glucose transporter(GLUT)1 and GLUT3 in hippocampus of aging model rats. METHODS: A total of 60 female SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups including sham control group, aging model group, 80 mg/kg resveratrol group, 160 mg/kg soy isoflavones group, 80 mg/kg resveratrol +160 mg/kg soy isoflavones group, 0. 8 mg/kg estradiol valerate group. The aging model rats was induced by ovariectomy combined with intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg D-galactose. Intragastric administration was performed once a day for 12 weeks. The avoidance task was measured by the shuttle box test. The NeuN expression were measured by the immunofluorescence. The genes and proteins expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in rat hippocampus were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the sham control group, the avoidance latency in the aging model group was prolonged, and the active avoidance response rate and the total avoidance response rate were decreased. The number of NeuN positive cells decreased and the expression levels of GLUT1 and GLUT3 genes and proteins were decreased(P&lt;0. 05). Compared with the aging model group, the escape latency significantly declined(P&lt;0. 01), but the rates of active avoidance response and total avoidance response increased, the number of NeuN positive cells increased significantly, the expression levels of GLUT1 and GLUT3 genes and proteins up-regulated in the rats of the three intervention groups(P&lt;0. 05 or P&lt;0. 01). Compared with the soy isoflavones group, the active avoidance response rate was increased in the combined group(P&lt;0. 05). In comparison with those for the resveratrol group, the avoidance latency was shortened and the active avoidance response rate was increased, the number of NeuN positive cells and the expression levels of GLUT3 gene and protein were significantly increased in the combined group(P&lt;0. 05). There was no significant difference between the combined intervention group and the estradiol valerate group(P&gt;0. 05). CONCLUSION: Resveratrol and soy isoflavones alone and in combination can improve the learning and memory ability of aging rat models. The mechanism may be related to up-regulating the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 genes and proteins in the hippocampus, promoting the transmembrane transport of glucose and reducing neuronal loss.",

As an endocrine disruptor, it seriously threatens human health and ecological environmental safety. This study examines the impact of intervention with soybean isoflavones (SIF) on DEHP-induced toxicity using a metabonomics approach. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into control (H), SIF-treated (A, 86 mg/kg body weight), DEHP-treated (B, 68 mg/kg), and SIF plus DEHP-treated (D) groups. Rats were given SIF and DEHP daily through diet and gavage, respectively. After 30 d of treatment, rat urine was tested using UPLC/MS with multivariate analysis. Metabolic changes were also evaluated using biochemical assays. RESULTS: Metabolomics analyses revealed that p-cresol glucuronide, methyl hippuric acid, N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, lysophosphatidycholine [18:2 (9Z, 12Z)] {lysoPC [18:2 (9Z, 12Z)]}, lysoPC (16:0), xanthosine, undecanedioic acid, and N6-acetyl-l-lysine were present at significantly different levels in control and treatment groups. CONCLUSION: SIF supplementation partially protects rats from DEHP-induced metabolic abnormalities by regulating fatty acid metabolism, antioxidant defense system, amino acid metabolism, and is also involved in the protection of mitochondria.",

The objective of this experiment was to recreate immunological effects previously observed in young pigs infected with PRRSV receiving ISF and determine how those effects influence growth performance during the entire growth period from weaning to market. In total, 96 weaned barrows were group housed in a biosafety level-2 containment facility and allotted to 1 of 3 experimental treatments that were maintained throughout the study: noninfected pigs received an ISF-devoid control diet (NEG, n = 24), and infected pigs received either the control diet (POS, n = 36) or that supplemented with total ISF in excess of 1,600 mg/kg (ISF, n = 36). Following a 7-d adaptation, weanling pigs were inoculated intranasally with either a sham-control (PBS) or live PRRSV (1 × 105 TCID50/mL, strain NADC20). After inoculation, individual blood samples (n = 8 to 12/treatment) were routinely collected to monitor viral clearance and hematological parameters, including serum neutralizing anti-PRRSV antibody production. Pen-based oral fluids were used to monitor PRRSV clearance at later growth stages. A 1- or 2-way ANOVA was performed to compare experimental treatments depending on whether the outcome was repeatedly measured. In general, PRRSV infection decreased performance during early growth phases, resulting in 5.4% lower final BW for POS vs. NEG pigs (P < 0.05). Dietary ISF elicited inconsistent effects on growth performance, increased (P < 0.05) neutrophil cell counts and the relative proportion of memory T-cells, and decreased (P < 0.05) the time to full PRRSV clearance from oral fluids. Dietary ISF also elicited earlier, more robust anti-PRRSV neutralizing antibody production when compared with POS pigs. Additionally, and most notably, POS pigs experienced ~50% greater infection-related mortality rate vs. ISF pigs (P < 0.05), which may have significant economic implications for producers. Overall, dietary ISF ingestion supported immune responses and reduced mortality in PRRSV-infected pigs when fed to growing pigs though the biological mechanism of these effects remains unclear.",

Vitamin D deficiency and hormonal disorders are also prevalent in Iranian women, and may influence the severity of clinical outcomes mediated by microinflammation, oxidative stress and intestinal permeability pathways. Our objective was to investigate the effects of co-administration of soy and vitamin D on some inflammatory, antioxidant and gut permeability markers in women with IBS. METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, women (18-75 years of age) were randomly allocated into four groups to receive soy isoflavones (40 mg/day), cholecalciferol (50,000 IU/15 days), both soy isoflavones and cholecalciferol, or placebo for six weeks. The outcomes were plasma inflammatory markers, antioxidant status and fecal protease activity at week 0 and week 6. RESULTS: After the intervention, plasma inflammatory markers and fecal protease activity were reduced significantly in all treatment groups compared to the placebo group; however, there was no significant effect on antioxidant status. CONCLUSION: This study suggests combined supplementation of soy isoflavones and active vitamin D can improve some biochemical parameters regarding inflammation and intestinal permeability of IBS in women.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Estrogens and calcium regulate vascular health but caused adverse cardiovascular events in randomized trials. OBJECTIVES: Whether phytoestrogenic soy isoflavones modulate the physiological effects of calcium on blood pressure was explored. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized study assigned 99 premenopausal women to 136.6 mg isoflavones (as aglycone equivalents) and 98 to placebo for 5 days per week for up to 2 years. Blood pressure, serum calcium and urinary excretion of daidzein (DE) and genistein (GE) were measured repeatedly before and during treatment. RESULTS: Isoflavones did not affect blood pressure per intake dose assignment (i.e. intention-to-treat, n = 197), but significantly affected blood pressure per measured urinary excretion of isoflavones (i.e. per protocol analysis, n = 166). Isoflavones inversely moderated calcium effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (interaction term β-estimates: - 3.1 for DE, - 12.86 for GE, all P < 0.05), and decreased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (β-estimates: - 0.84 for DE, - 2.82 for GE, all P < 0.05) after controlling for calcium. The net intervention effects between the maximum and no isoflavone excretion were - 17.7 and + 13.8 mmHg changes of SBP, respectively, at serum calcium of 10.61 and 8.0 mg/dL, and about 2.6 mmHg decrease of DBP. CONCLUSIONS: Moderation by isoflavones of the physiological effect of calcium tends to normalize SBP, and this effect is most significant when calcium concentrations are at the upper and lower limits of the physiological norm. Isoflavones decrease DBP independent of calcium levels. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of this novel micronutrient effect on blood pressure homeostasis and cardiovascular health.

Many studies have reported that obesity is closely related to visceral fatty acid metabolism, but the effect has not been well defined. In this study, we show that soy isoflavones improve visceral fatty acid metabolism in diet-induced obese male rats, which was indicated by reduced body weight and visceral fat cell area, as well as suppressed visceral fat synthesis and accelerated fat hydrolysis. We also found that common components of soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, were able to inhibit the lipid accumulation process in 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, we showed that soy isoflavones can promote on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity both in vivo and in vitro, which may be implicated in lipid metabolism regulation of soy isoflavones. Our study demonstrates the potential of soy isoflavones as a mechanism for regulating lipid homeostasis in visceral adipose tissue, proven to be beneficial for obesity treatment.",

Nutrients play an important role in the prevention of many civilization diseases, such as osteoporosis, type II diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular diseases. The biological activity of natural plant components allows their use in the treatment of various diseases, especially civilization diseases, to be speculated. Special attention is paid to phenolic compounds that have numerous health-promoting properties. Isoflavones, phenolic compounds, are commonly found in legumes, especially in soybeans. Their structural similarity to 17-β-estradiol (E2), the main female sex hormone, allows them to induce estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects by binding to estrogen receptors, and their consumption has been associated with a decreased risk of hormone-related cancers. In addition, numerous epidemiological studies and related meta-analyses suggest that soy consumption may be associated with a lower incidence of certain diseases. However, there are some doubts about the potential effects on health, such as the effectiveness of cardiovascular risk reduction or breast cancer-promoting properties.

RESULTS: A total of 5313 articles were found, screened, and assessed for eligibility, and finally 52 trials were included in the meta-analysis. Consumption of soy isoflavones caused significant improvement in BMD of lumbar spine (mean difference (MD) = 0.76%; 95% CI: 0.09, 1.42%; p = 0.03), hip (MD = 0.22%; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.42%; p = 0.04), and femoral neck (MD = 2.27%; 95% CI: 1.22, 3.31%; p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that in all 3 sites, the improvement was significant in normal weight subjects and interventions longer than a year, although trial location and dosage were also factors influencing isoflavones' impact on BMD. Among markers of bone turnover, osteoprotegerin (MD = 5.79; 95% CI: 3.08, 8.51 pg/ml; p < 0.001), pyridinoline (MD = -5.13; 95% CI: -7.76, -2.50 nmol/mmol; p < 0.001), and C-telopeptides (MD = -0.08; 95% CI: -0.16, -0.00 ng/ml; p = 0.04) were favorably affected by isoflavones while osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase did not change. Subgroup analysis of bone markers showed that in overweight/obese individuals and dosages <90 mg/day, isoflavones are more effective. CONCLUSIONS: Soy isoflavones prevent osteoporosis-related bone loss in any weight status or treatment duration. They increase BMD in normal weight subjects and diminish bone resorption in overweight/obese individuals. Although bone resorption may be decelerated over short-term isoflavone consumption, periods longer than a year are probably needed to affect BMD. Isoflavones also appear benefits on bone in any dose or subjects' ethnicity.",

These are labelled with function claims of reducing visceral fat. However, these foods have not undergone proper safety assessment such as the evaluation of their oestrogenic activity and effects on drug-metabolising enzymes (cytochrome P-450: CYP) in the liver. This study evaluated the estrogenic effect and the hepatic CYP activity and mRNA expression in normal female mice as a safety assessment of PFI (Experiment 1). In addition, the bone mineral density and visceral fat weight in ovariectomised mice (OVX) compared to soy isoflavones (SI) was evaluated to assess the efficacy of PFI (Experiment 2). OVX control fed a control diet, OVX fed a PFI diet (the recommended human intake of PFI), OVX fed a PFI20 diet (20- times the recommended PFI), OVX fed an SI diet (the recommended human intake of SI), and OVX fed an SI20 diet (20 -times the recommended intake of SI) for 28 days in Experiment 2. Body, liver, and visceral fat weights were not affected by the PFI, PFI20, SI, or SI20 diets. The hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A activities were elevated by the SI20 treatment. Ovariectomy-induced bone loss was inhibited by the SI20 treatment, but not by the PFI20 treatment. These results suggest that (1) PFI intake in human doses had no oestrogenic properties and did not affect CYP activity in the liver; (2) there was no evidence that PFI affects the amount of visceral fat in OVX mice.",

      "abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most prevalent disease of swine globally. Infection of weanling pigs with PRRSV leads to a complex immune response resulting in significant disease and decreased growth performance. Previous experimental evidence suggests that increasing concentrations of soybean meal in the diet of young pigs confer benefits in terms of growth performance and immune parameters. The objective of this experiment was to identify potential modes of action for this benefit, specifically the ability for soy-derived isoflavones (ISF) to confer immunological benefits to young pigs infected with PRRSV. Four dietary treatments differing in soy protein source (soy protein concentrate vs. enzyme-treated soybean meal) and ISF supplementation (none vs. 1,500 mg total ISF/kg) were fed; the control diet (CON) contained soy protein concentrate and no supplemental ISF. Weanling pigs (60 barrows, 21 d of age, 5.71 ± 0.44 kg) from a naturally Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mh)-infected source herd were individually housed in disease containment chambers and provided ad libitum access to experimental diets for 7 d before receiving either a sham inoculation or a 9.28 × 103 50% tissue culture infective dose of PRRSV at 28 d of age (0 d postinoculation). A total of 5 experimental treatments included an uninfected group receiving the CON diet, plus four infected groups each receiving a different dietary treatment. Growth performance and rectal temperatures were recorded throughout the study, and blood was collected for quantification of serum PRRSV load, presence of anti-PRRSV antibodies, differential complete blood counts, cytokine concentrations, and T-cell immunophenotyping. Data were analyzed as a 2-way or 3-way ANOVA for all treatments including PRRSV-infected pigs, in addition to a single degree of freedom contrast to compare uninfected and infected pigs receiving the CON diet. PRRSV-infection reduced growth rate and efficiency compared with noninfected controls with minimal influences by ISF. Supplemental ISF reduced PRRSV-induced band neutrophilia and improved cytotoxic-to-helper T-cell ratios. These results suggest that ISF contribute to activation of adaptive immune system pathways and could benefit recovery from and clearance of PRRSV infections.",

      "abstract": "Soybeans are a rich source of isoflavones that have been linked with anti-inflammatory processes and various health benefits. However, specific mechanisms whereby soy bioactives impact immune cell subsets are unclear. Isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein, are metabolized by microbes to bioactive metabolites as O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol, whose presence has been linked to health benefits. We examined how soy isoflavones and metabolites impact natural killer (NK) cell signaling and function. We observe no impact of isoflavones on viability of healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or NK cells, even at high (25 µM) concentrations. However, pre-treatment of PBMCs with physiologically-relevant concentrations of genistein (p = 0.0023) and equol (p = 0.006) decreases interleukin (IL)-12/IL-18-induced interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production versus controls. Detailed cellular analyses indicate genistein and equol decrease IL-12/IL-18-induced IFN-γ production by human NK cell subsets, but do not consistently alter cytotoxicity. At the level of signal transduction, genistein decreases IL-12/IL-18-induced total phosphorylated tyrosine, and phosphorylation MAPK pathway components. Further, genistein limits IL-12/IL-18-mediated upregulation of IL-18Rα expression on NK cells (p = 0.0109). Finally, in vivo studies revealed that C57BL/6 mice fed a soy-enriched diet produce less plasma IFN-γ following administration of IL-12/IL-18 versus control-fed animals (p < 0.0001). This study provides insight into how dietary soy modulates NK cell functions.",

Furthermore, a substantial body of evidence in the literature suggests that soy supplementation may improve the efficacy and prevent the adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Isoflavones constitute the predominant anticancer bioactive compounds in soy. Genistein, which is the most abundant and active isoflavone in soy, has a multitude of effects on cancer cells, including inhibition of NF-κB activation and DNA methylation, enhancement of histone acetylation, inhibition of cell growth and metastasis, and antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects. Isoflavones are orally bioavailable, easily metabolized, and usually considered safe. In this article, we review in vitro and in vivo evidence as well as the results of clinical and epidemiological studies on the effects of soy isoflavones, with a focus on sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation while at the same time protecting normal cells from the harmful effects of these treatments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soy-based dietary supplements have been promoted as natural alternatives to menopausal hormone therapy, but their potential effect on breast cancer development is controversial. OBJECTIVES: We examined the relation between the consumption of soy supplements and the risk of breast cancer, overall and by tumor hormone receptor status, among women aged >50 y. METHODS: In total, 76,442 women from the Etude Epidemiologique aupres de Femmes de la Mutuelle Generale de l'Education Nationale (E3N) cohort, born between 1925 and 1950, were followed from 2000 to 2011 (11.2 y on average, starting at a mean age of 59.5 y; 3608 incident breast cancers), with soy supplement use assessed every 2-3 y. HRs of breast cancer were estimated with the use of multivariable Cox models. RESULTS: Compared with never using soy supplements, the HRs associated with current use of soy supplements were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.11) for all, 0.78 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.99) for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, and 2.01 (95% CI: 1.41, 2.86) for ER-negative breast cancers. There was no association between past use of soy supplements and breast cancer. HRs for current use were 1.36 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.93) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.02) among women with and without a family history of breast cancer, respectively (P-interaction = 0.03) and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.30) ≥5 y after menopause compared with 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.81) in premenopause or ≤5 y postmenopause (P-interaction = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of women aged >50 y, we report opposing associations of soy supplements with ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer risk. Our results also caution against the use of these supplements in women with a family history of breast cancer. Whether the risk profile of soy supplements could be more favorable among premenopausal or recently postmenopausal women deserves further investigation.",

The present study aimed at investigating the effect of soy isoflavones as HRT on immunological and bone health-related parameters with a special focus on the interactions between immunological status and metabolism. Thirty healthy cyclic female Wistar rats were used in this experiment. Ten females were sham-operated, and 20 females were subjected to ovariectomy. Overiectomized (OVX) female rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: the control group (G1, OVX/casein) was fed a casein-based diet, and the second group (G2, OVX/soy) was fed a high soy isoflavone diet. Both groups were compared to a sham-operated group (G3, sham/casein). Treatments continued for 7 weeks. Feed intake, weight gain, and lymphoid organ relative weights were recorded. Some metabolic, immunological, and bone health-related parameters were measured. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined. Bone histopathology and immunohistochemistry to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) were done. Feeding soy to OVX females reduced feed intake, weight gain, relative lymphoid organ weight, and T-lymphocytes transformation. Soy isoflavone administration normalized nearly all metabolic and immunological parameters to a level comparable to the sham group via oxidative stress amelioration and bone ERα promotion. Soy isoflavones seemed to be good HRT in estrogen deprivation which modulated the appetite, weight gain, lipid profile, proinflammation, and bone turnover.",

Previous studies suggest that soy isoflavones can reduce PAI-1 levels. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate PAI-1 genotype-specific differences of the soy isoflavone response in asthma outcomes. METHODS: A PAI-1 functional polymorphism (rs1799768, 4G5G) was characterized in subjects with poorly controlled asthma enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of soy isoflavones (n = 265). Genotype-specific treatment responses on asthma outcomes were compared between soy isoflavones and placebo. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured with or without TGF-β1, genistein, or both, and PAI-1 levels were measured. RESULTS: The 4G4G/4G5G genotype was associated with a greater risk for allergy-related worsened asthma symptoms and eczema at baseline compared with the 5G5G genotype. There was a significant interaction between the genotype and soy isoflavone intervention on oral corticosteroid use for asthma exacerbation (P = .005). In a subgroup analysis soy isoflavones significantly reduced the use of oral corticosteroids (number of events/person-year) by 4-fold compared with placebo in the 4G4G/4G5G genotype (0.2 vs 0.8; relative risk, 0.28; P < .001) but not in the 5G5G genotype. Soy isoflavones reduced plasma PAI-1 levels compared with placebo. Genistein treatment reduced TGF-β1-induced PAI-1 production in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that soy isoflavone treatment provides a significant benefit in reducing the number of severe asthma exacerbations in asthmatic patients with the high PAI-1-producing genotype. PAI-1 polymorphisms can be used as a genetic biomarker for soy isoflavone-responsive patients with asthma.",

For that reason, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the primary treatment for prostate cancer. However, the majority of patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer, which eventually leads to mortality. Novel therapeutic approaches, including dietary changes, have been explored. Soy isoflavones have become a focus of interest because of their positive health benefits on numerous diseases, particularly hormone-related cancers, including prostate and breast cancers. An important strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer might thus be the action of soy isoflavones on the AR signaling pathway. The current review article provides a detailed overview of the anticancer potential of soy isoflavones (genistein, daidzein and glycitein), as mediated by their effect on AR."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer, including prostate cancer, often use dietary supplements, such as soy or isoflavones, before, during, or after therapy. There is little information about possible interactions between supplements and cancer chemotherapy. There are some reports suggesting enhancement by genistein of taxane chemotherapy for castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: We investigated whether physiologically attainable concentrations of soy isoflavones (≤10 μM) interact with taxanes on growth inhibition of CRPC cells in vitro and in vivo in nude mice exposed via the diet, on microtubule disassembly in vitro, and on P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux in 22Rv1 cells and CYP3A4 activity in microsomes. RESULTS: Genistein, daidzein, and equol did not affect growth of VCaP, 22Rv1, C4-2, and PC-3 CRPC cells or growth inhibition of these cells by docetaxel and cabazitaxel. These isoflavones did not inhibit microtubule disassembly in vitro or inhibit the microtubule effects of taxanes and genistein did not bind substantially to microtubules. Genistein considerably inhibited P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux in 22Rv1 cells and CYP3A4 activity in microsomes. However, dietary supplementation with genistein at 250 and 500 ppm did not affect the tumor growth inhibiting effect of docetaxel on 22Rv1 cells xenografted in nude mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results with relevant cell models and clinically achievable concentrations of soy isoflavones do not support the notion that genistein or other soy isoflavones can enhance the effects of taxane chemotherapy in CRPC cell and xenograft models. Yet, the inhibitory effects of genistein on drug efflux in 22Rv1 cells and on microsomal CYP3A4 activity raise the possibility that genistein can affect taxane effects on CRPC cells in other circumstances than those we studied, which merits further research.",

The prevalence of this condition, associated with the physiological stage of menopause, is continuously increasing. This study evaluated the effectiveness of soy isoflavones as compared to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in low doses, on the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, by determining bone mineral density (BMD) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (D-pyr) in physiological postmenopausal women. The study was conducted over a period of 12 months, on three parallel groups, which included a total of 325 postmenopausal women (HRT group: n = 95; phytoestrogens group: n = 124; control group: n = 106). At the one-year evaluation, we observed T-score normalization in a small number of cases (5.26%, 2.42% and 0.00%, respectively). The average values of D-Pyr decreased by 11.38% in the group treated with phytoestrogens (p < 0.05) and by 15.32% in the group that followed HRT (p < 0.05); it increased by 4.38% in the control group (p > 0.05). Both therapies have beneficial effects on bone metabolism, leading to a significant decrease in the evolution of bone resorption and there are no major differences between the efficacy of HRT and phytoestrogens in terms of the effects on BMD and bone resorption."

      "abstract": "In the recent years, interest in soybean as a neuroprotective nutrient in the management of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) has increased and soy isoflavones (SI), as kinds of soybean phytochemicals, are thought to be biologically active components that confer this beneficial effect against neurodegenerative diseases. However, the neuroprotective effect of SI is not well understood. Therefore, the present study (30 days) was conducted to investigate the neuroprotective effects of soy isoflavones (SI) on scopolamine (SCOP)-induced memory impairments in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice (aged 4 weeks) and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. SI (40 mg/kg) administration improved the cognitive performance of SCOP-treated mice in an object location recognition task and the Morris water maze test. SI (40 mg/kg) administration significantly enhanced cholinergic system function and suppressed oxidative stress levels in the hippocampus of SCOP-treated mice. Furthermore, SI (40 mg/kg) treatment markedly upregulated the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression levels in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results demonstrated that soy isoflavones exerted a significant neuroprotective effect on cognitive dysfunctions induced by scopolamine, suggesting that soy isoflavones could be a good candidate for possible treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD).",

      "abstract": "The pathological phenomenon of somatopause, noticeable in hypogonadal ageing subjects, is based on the growth hormone (GH) production and secretion decrease along with the fall in GH binding protein and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, causing different musculoskeletal, metabolic and mental issues. From the perspective of safety and efficacy, GH treatment is considered to be highly controversial, while some other therapeutic approaches (application of IGF-1, GH secretagogues, gonadal steroids, cholinesterase-inhibitors or various combinations) exhibit more or less pronounced weaknesses in this respect. Soy isoflavones, phytochemicals that have already demonstrated the health benefits in treated elderly, at least experimentally reveal their potential for the somatopausal symptoms remediation. Namely, genistein enhanced GHRH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and GH release in rat anterior pituitary cells; refreshed and stimulated the somatotropic system (hypothalamic nuclei and pituitary GH cells) function in a rat model of the mild andropause, and stimulated the GH output in ovariectomized ewes as well as the amplitude of GH pulses in the rams. Daidzein, on the other hand, increased body mass, trabecular bone mass and decreased bone turnover in the animal model of severe andropause, while both isoflavones demonstrated blood cholesterol-lowering effect in the same model. These data, which necessarily need to be preclinically and clinically filtered, hint some cautious optimism and call for further innovative designing of balanced soy isoflavone-based therapeutics."

Soy isoflavones may act as selective estrogen receptor modulators. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether soy isoflavones had an effect on CVR markers. METHODS: The expected 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality were calculated as a secondary endpoint from a double blind randomised parallel study involving 200 women (mean age 55 years, Caucasian, Hull, UK, 2012) in the early menopause who were randomised to 15 g soy protein with 66 mg isoflavone (SPI) or 15 g soy protein alone (depleted of all isoflavones; SP) given as a snack bar between meals daily for 6 months. Age, diabetes, smoking, blood pressure and lipid profiles were used to calculate CVR using the Framingham CVR engine. RESULTS: SPI treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the metabolic parameters and systolic blood pressure compared to SP (p < 0.01). There were no changes in fasting lipid profile and diastolic blood pressure with either treatment. At 6 months, changes in these parameters with SPI treatment were reflected in a calculated 27% (p < 0.01) reduction in 10 year coronary heart disease risk, a 37% (p < 0.01) reduction in myocardial infarction risk, a 24% (p < 0.04) reduction in cardiovascular disease and 42% (p < 0.02) reduction in cardiovascular disease death risk. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with soy protein with isoflavones for 6 months significantly improved CVR markers and calculated CVR at 6 months during early menopause compared to soy protein without isoflavones.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soy isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein, are bioflavonoids found in soy products that are able to interact with various hormones such as estrogen. Epidemiological studies reveal a proper level of isoflavones in diet can prevent many diseases like cancers or diabetes. Therefore, it is important to study the biotransformation and xenobiotic metabolism of soy isoflavones. METHODS: A systematic review of published studies was carried out to investigate the characterization of isoflavones and their metabolites, sample pretreatment and quantitative analysis of isoflavones, and the influence of soy isoflavones on drug and xenobiotic metabolism. RESULTS: Aglycones with weak estrogen-like activities are the biologically active forms of the soy isoflavones in mammals. The most recent advances including extraction, purification and detection of isoflavones in soybean and soy products are discussed. The effects of soy isoflavones on drug and xenobiotic metabolism involve in regulation of phase I cytochrome P450 (CYPs) enzyme and phase I detoxifying enzymes expression and activity. At the molecular level, soy isoflavones have proved capable of estrogenic/antiestrogenic with tissue-selective, anti-cancer, antiobesity, anti-oxidation, and tyrosine kinase inhibition activities. CONCLUSION: This review summarized different aspects of soy isoflavones and their molecular mechanisms of pharmacological action on xenobiotic, which demonstrated that soy isoflavones can decrease the incidence of many diseases and benefit for human health. However, since the lack of clinical research for evaluation of the proper dosage of intake of soy isoflavones in diet or adjunctive therapy, there is a need for further studies on the selection of doses, biomedical applications and adverse effects of isoflavones for human health.",

At the end of long-term administration trial, blood protein, cholesterol, triglyceride, glycosylated serum protein, C-reactive protein, insulin, aminotransferase, lipid peroxide, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α were estimated. Inhibition of soy isoflavones against α-amylase and α-glucosidase, as well as on glucose uptake into brush border membrane vesicles or Caco-2 cells were determined in vitro. In single administration experiment, soy isoflavones reduced postprandial blood glucose levels in GK rats. In long-term administration, hypoglycemic effect of soy isoflavones was first observed at week 12 and maintained till week 16. A significant reduction in fasting blood glucose, C-reactive protein, and lipid peroxide was noted at week 16. However, there was no significant treatment effect on blood insulin. Furthermore, soy isoflavone administration resulted in significant decreases in glycosylated serum protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6. Other biochemical parameters, such as protein, cholesterol, triglyceride and aminotransferases were not modified, however. The results in vitro showed that soy isoflavones showed a potent inhibitory effect on intestinal α-glucosidase, but not on pancreatic α-amylase. Soy isoflavones also decreased glucose transport potency into brush border membrane vesicles or Caco-2 cells. It is concluded that soy isoflavones from hypocotyl, performs hypoglycemic function in GK rats with type 2 diabetes, maybe via suppression of carbohydrate digestion and glucose uptake in small intestine."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Menopause is associated with many unpleasant symptoms which vary in different phases of menopausal transition. Although, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is considered the most effective mode of treatment for these symptoms, its use is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. Soy isoflavones are being widely used as a safer alternative to HRT, even though scientific evidence of their efficacy is poor or lacking. AIM: To study the effect of soy isoflavone supplementation on the menopausal symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational pilot study was done involving 29 perimenopausal and 21 postmenopausal women prescribed 100 mg soy isoflavones for 12 weeks. Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) questionnaire was administered to the patients before starting soy isoflavone therapy and at the end of treatment. Responses were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software 23.0. RESULTS: Total score of both the groups were comparable at baseline. Among perimenopausal women highest score was given to symptoms of psychological domain. Urogenital symptoms were the worst among postmenopausal women. After 12 weeks of treatment, total scores improved significantly by 19.55% and 12.62% in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal women respectively. The greatest improvement was seen in scores of hot flashes for both the groups and the least improvement was shown by symptoms of urogenital subscale. CONCLUSION: Soy isoflavone improves the MRS score among both the perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. As they are most effective for somatic and psychological symptoms, their use could be beneficial during perimenopause."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soy phytoestrogens are potential alternatives to postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Adverse effects of HRT such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism are mediated by calcium-induced signaling. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether soy isoflavones affect serum calcium in healthy female subjects. DESIGN: In a double-blind trial, 197 premenopausal women were randomly assigned to either isoflavone (N = 99) or placebo pills (N = 98) 5 days per week for up to 2 years, plus prenatal vitamins. Isoflavone pills contained 60 mg genistein, 60 mg daidzein and 16.6 mg glycitein (expressed as aglycone equivalents). All pills contained 15 mg riboflavin as an adherence marker. Blood chemistries and urinary daidzein, genistein and riboflavin were measured multiple times during the luteal phase before and during treatment. RESULTS: Analysis of the adherent population (N = 83 per group), revealed significantly strong associations between urinary levels of isoflavones and serum concentrations of calcium (regression coefficients 0.082 for daidzein and 0.229 for genistein, all P < 0.01) and chloride (regression coefficient, -1.537 for genistein, P < 0.0001), mediated in part by albumin. The effects amounted to mean changes of +0.24 mg/dL for calcium and -1.45 mEq/L for chloride, with each visit for subjects excreting the most vs. the least amounts of isoflavones. These associations were not evident in the intention-to-treat analysis (N = 197) that did not assess expected variations in isoflavone levels within and between subjects from metabolism and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: These novel and strong effects of soy isoflavones on calcium homeostasis have important implications for long term effects of these natural substances on cardiovascular diseases.",

After soy isoflavones were administered, a significant (P<0.05) decrease (44%) in the serum estrodial levels of the high-dose (HD) group were observed. Cultured granulosa cells from the middle- (MD) and HD groups showed significantly (P<0.05) reduced (31%, 45%, respectively) in vitro estradiol secretion, and those from the HD group showed significantly (P<0.05) reduced progesterone (25%) secretion. Compared with the control group, the mRNA expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), cytochromeP450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (Cyp11a1 and Cyp19a1), and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3b (Hsd3b) genes also decreased. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting revealed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in key transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) expression in the HD group. The detection of DNA methylation using bisulfitesequencing PCR (BSP) suggested a significantly (P<0.05) increased total methylation rate in the proximal SF-1 promoter in the HD group. Further studies showed that treatment with soy isoflavones can significantly (P<0.05) increase the mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3a. This study proved that soy isoflavone administration from weaning until sexual maturity could inhibit ovarian steroidogenesis, suggesting that SF-1 might play an important role in this effect. In addition, DNA methylation might play a role in the downregulation of SF-1 gene expression induced by soy isoflavones.",

      "abstract": "Soy may be a suitable food for anti-obesity efforts because of its high protein and isoflavone content. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate potential effects of soy and soy isoflavones on weight, waist circumference, and fat mass. PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched. Twenty-four trials with soy and 17 trials with isoflavones passed the eligibility stage. According to the results, soy showed no overall statistically significant effect on weight, waist circumference, or fat mass, but a significant increasing effect on weight was observed in some circumstances: for instance, in obese subjects [mean difference (MD): 0.80 kg; 95% CI: 0.15, 1.45 kg; P = 0.02], with ingestions of ≥40 g soy protein/d (MD: 0.94 kg; 95% CI: 0.11, 1.77 kg; P = 0.03), with short-term applications (1-3 mo) (MD: 0.45 kg; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.86 kg; P = 0.03), and when soy was compared with meat (MD: 0.36 kg; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.64 kg; P = 0.03) and whey protein (MD: 1.53 kg; 95% CI: 0.10, 2.96 kg; P = 0.04). In contrast to the effects of soy on weight, soy significantly decreased waist circumference in older ages (MD: -0.36 cm; 95% CI: -0.71, -0.01 cm; P = 0.04), in women (MD: -0.32 cm; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.08 cm; P = 0.01), and at doses of <40 g soy protein/d (MD: -0.31 cm; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.05 cm; P = 0.02). Isoflavone studies, conducted only in women, showed that isoflavones may reduce body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) (MD: -0.26; 95% CI: -0.55, 0.04; P = 0.085), especially in dosages <100 mg/d (MD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.06; P = 0.02) and in intervention periods of 2-6 mo (MD: -0.28; 95% CI: -0.56, 0.00; P = 0.053), but no effect was observed in higher doses or longer intervention periods. Also, a trend for reduced BMI after consumption of isoflavones was observed in Caucasians (MD: -0.35; 95% CI: -0.74, 0.04; P = 0.08). Overall, results showed that, although soy is the major source of isoflavones, soy and isoflavones may have different impacts on weight status.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of isoflavones and 17β-estradiol on the vaginal epithelium extracellular matrix and hyaluronic acid (HA) in the diabetic rat model. METHODS: Sixty adult, virgin, female rats underwent ovariectomy, then randomization into six groups of ten animals each: GI, sham ovariectomized control animals; GII, sham ovariectomized control diabetic animals; GIII, control ovariectomized rats receiving propylene glycol vehicle; GIV, control ovariectomized diabetic animals receiving propylene glycol vehicle; GV, diabetic ovariectomized animals treated with soy isoflavones (150 mg/kg by gavage); GVI, ovariectomized diabetic rats treated with estrogen (17β-estradiol, 10 mg/kg, subcutaneously). Treatment took place over 30 consecutive days. After euthanasia, a portion of the vagina was immersed in liquid nitrogen for RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Another portion was processed for paraffin embedding. Sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin for histomorphometry and Picro Sirius Red for collagen quantification. RESULTS: Vaginal epithelium histomorphometry in GIII (15.3 ± 1.1 µm) and GIV (14.5 ± 1.8 µm) was thinner than in GV (41.3 ± 1.5 µm) and GVI (74.3 ± 1.6 µm). There was an increase in collagen content in GV (84.1 ± 1.2 µm) and GVI (88.2 ± 1.7 µm). HA quantification was higher in GV (0.38 ± 1.1 μg/mg) and GVI (0.49 ± 1.4 μg/mg) when compared with GIII (0.12 ± 1.1 μg/mg) and GIV (0.10 ± 1.2 μg/mg), p < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Soy isoflavones increase hyaluronic acid concentration in the vagina of diabetic ovariectomized rats. Such findings might help to attenuate the effects of vulvovaginal atrophy in women.",

This study aimed to determine the influence of different-doses of soy isoflavones (SIF) on testicular morphology, testosterone levels and the expression of genes and proteins related to testosterone synthesis in diet-induced obesity (DIO) male rats. We used high-fat diet (HFD) to establish a DIO male rat model, then obese rats orally received SIF at doses of 0, 50, 250 and 500 mg/kg per day for four weeks. Results revealed that the body weight was obviously increased, and seminiferous tubules were significantly deformed in obese rats compared with that in normal diet fed controls. After SIF treatment, DIO male rats exhibited decreased body weight in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied with significantly alleviated testicular damages, as well as increased testosterone levels and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR), cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1), cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17), hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3β (HSD3β), and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-17β (HSD17β) protein and mRNA levels. In conclusion, SIF could alleviate testicular damages, increase testosterone levels, and upregulate the expression of proteins and genes related to testosterone synthesis in DIO male rats, which would be important for obesity male reproduction treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The negative effects of incidental radiation on the heart and its vessels, particularly in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, left-sided breast cancer, and lymphoma, are known. Late cardiac events induced by radiotherapy including coronary artery disease, ischemia, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction can manifest months to years after radiotherapy. We have previously demonstrated that soy isoflavones mitigate inflammatory responses induced in lungs by thoracic irradiation resulting in decreased vascular damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. In the current study, we investigate the use of soy isoflavones to protect cardiac vessels and myocardium from radiation injury. METHODS: Mice received a single dose of 10-Gy thoracic irradiation and daily oral treatment with soy isoflavones. At different time points, hearts were processed for histopathology studies to evaluate the effect of soy isoflavones on radiation-induced damage to cardiac vessels and myocardium. RESULTS: Radiation damage to arteries and myocardium was detected by 16 weeks after radiation. Soy isoflavones given in conjunction with thoracic irradiation were found to reduce damage to the artery walls and radiation-induced fibrosis in the myocardium. CONCLUSION: Our histopathological findings suggest a radioprotective role of soy isoflavones to prevent cardiac injury. This approach could translate to the use of soy isoflavones as a safe complement to thoracic radiotherapy with the goal of improving the overall survival in patients whose cancer has been successfully controlled by the radiotherapy but who otherwise succumb to heart toxicity."

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of dietary soy isoflavones on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Mice were administered DSS and soy isoflavones, and histomorphometry, oxidative stress, inflammation and intestinal tight junctions were determined. The current study demonstrated that dietary soy isoflavones alleviated DSS-induced growth suppression, colonic inflammatory response, oxidative stress and colonic barrier dysfunction. DSS treatment was indicated to activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TRL4) and myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88) in mice, whereas dietary soy isoflavones inhibited Myd88 expression in DSS-challenged mice. In conclusion, dietary soy isoflavones alleviate DSS-induced inflammation in mice, which may be associated with enhancing antioxidant function and inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88 signal."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Soy isoflavones are expected to improve menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis in women. However, their efficacy is still inconclusive, and there was limited data for postmenopausal women in South Korea. We examined the effects of soy isoflavones on climacteric symptoms, bone biomarkers, and quality of life in Korean postmenopausal women. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A randomized, double-blind study design was used. Eighty-seven participants who had undergone natural menopause were randomly administered either 70 mg/day isoflavones (n = 43) or placebo (n = 41) for 12 weeks. We assessed the Kupperman index for climacteric symptoms and the menopause-specific quality of life (MENQOL) questionnaire for quality of the life. Biomarkers of bone metabolism were also measured in serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), osteocalcin (OC), N- and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx, CTx), and urine-deoxypyridinolin (u-DPD). RESULTS: Scores of the Kupperman index were decreased in both the isoflavones group (-7.0 ± 15.8, P = 0.0074) and placebo group (-6.3 ± 14.6, P = 0.0064) during the intervention, but no significant difference was noted between the groups. Regarding the bone formation markers, the level of serum BALP increased by 6.3 ± 4.1% (P = 0.004) and OC increased by 9.3 ± 6.2% (P < 0.001), meanwhile those of the placebo were not changed. For the bone resorption markers, NTx, CTx, and u-DPD were not significantly different in either group. MENQOL was significant decreased in the isoflavone group (-0.6 ± 0.5) and placebo group (-0.6 ± 0.4), with a significant difference between groups (P = 0.0228). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that 70 mg isoflavones supplement has beneficial effects on bone formation markers; however, it showed no benefit compared to the placebo on climacteric symptoms or quality of life."

The effects of soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, on the expression and secretion of porcine β-defensins (PBD) in endometrial epithelial cells were investigated under normal or poly I:C-stimulated conditions. METHOD OF STUDY: Primary cultured porcine endometrial epithelial (PE) cells were pretreated with genistein or daidzein followed by poly I:C inoculation. During treatment, the culture media were analyzed for PBD 1-4 secretion by ELISA and the total RNA for PBD gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Porcine endometrial epithelial cells constitutively expressed PBD 1-4 and secreted PBD-1, PBD-2, and PBD-4. Genistein and daidzein enhanced PBD-2 expression and PBD-2 and PBD-3 secretion. These compounds also potentiated PBD-2 and PBD-3 expression and secretion which were upregulated by poly I:C. CONCLUSION: Soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, could be potentially used for promoting the innate host defense of endometrium against infection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Isoflavones are polyphenols with estrogenic activity found mainly in soy and soy-derived products that need to be metabolised in the intestine by the gut bacteria to be fully active. There is little knowledge about isoflavone bioconversion and equol production in the human intestine. In this work, we developed an in vitro anaerobic culture model based on faecal slurries to assess the impact of isoflavone supplementation on the overall intestinal bacterial composition changes and associated metabolic transformations. RESULTS: In the faecal anaerobic batch cultures of this study bioconversion of isoflavones into equol was possible, suggesting the presence of viable equol-producing bacterial taxa within the faeces of menopausal women with an equol producer phenotype. The application of high-throughput DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed the composition of the faecal cultures to be modified by the addition of isoflavones, with enrichment of some bacterial gut members associated with the metabolism of phenolics and/or equol production, such as Collinsella, Faecalibacterium and members of the Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa. In addition, the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) detected in the isoflavone-containing faecal cultures was higher in those inoculated with faecal slurries from equol-producing women. CONCLUSIONS: This study constitutes the first step in the development of a faecal culturing system with isoflavones that would further allow the selection and isolation of intestinal bacterial types able to metabolize these compounds and produce equol in vitro. Although limited by the low number of faecal cultures analysed and the inter-individual bacterial diversity, the in vitro results obtained in this work tend to indicate that soy isoflavones might provide an alternative energy source for the increase of equol-producing taxa and enhancement of SCFAs production. SCFAs and equol are both considered pivotal bacterial metabolites in the triggering of intestinal health-related beneficial effects.",

METHODS: From a pool of women who had participated in a 1-year intervention study and were randomly assigned to either exercise + phytoestrogen (EX + PHY) or exercise + placebo (EX + PL), a total of 31 healthy but overweight women (mean age 59.2 ± 4.8 years, body mass index 29.1 ± 3.5 kg/m2) finished the study (EX + PHY, n = 15; EX + PL, n = 16). All the following variables were measured before, after 6 months and after 12 months of intervention: body composition (fat and lean body mass, DXA), HRQoL (SF-36 questionnaire: physical and mental component summaries and subscales; and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire), climacteric symptoms (Kupperman Index questionnaire). RESULTS: After 1 year of intervention, physical functioning (p = 0.003), role-emotional (p = 0.031), vitality (p = 0.007), and global health (p < 0.001) were significantly and similarly increased in both groups. Regarding climacteric symptoms, an improvement in the Kupperman index total score (p = 0.015) was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that adding phytoestrogens to exercise training does not provide the additive effect for HRQoL in postmenopausal and overweight women. Moreover, exercise and phytoestrogen may interfere in the improvement of climacteric symptoms in the long term.",

At the end of the treatment, mammary density, endometrial thickness, and hepatic function did not show substantial differences between groups. The Kuppermann index and particularly the tendency for hot flashes progressively and significantly decreased in frequency and severity during ESP versus C treatment. At the same time, a significant increase in sleep quality and psychophysical wellness parameters was observed in the ESP versus C groups. No adverse events were observed. Agnus-castus and magnolia, combined with SI + lactobacilli, can effectively and safely be used in symptomatic postmenopausal women, mainly when quality of sleep is the most disturbing complaint.

Soy isoflavones protect against radiation-induced lung injury, but the mediators of radioprotection remain unclear. We investigated the effect of radiation on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the lung and their modulation by soy isoflavones for a potential role in protection from radiation-induced lung injury. METHODS: BALB/c mice (5-6 weeks old) received a single 10 Gy dose of thoracic irradiation and soy isoflavones were orally administrated daily before and after radiation at 1 mg/day. Arginase-1 (Arg-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 were detected in lung tissue by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Lung MDSC subsets and their Arg-1 expression were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels in the lungs were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: At 1 week after radiation, CD11b+ cells expressing Arg-1 were decreased by radiation in lung tissue yet maintained in the lungs treated with radiation and soy isoflavones. Arg-1 was predominantly expressed by CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ granulocytic MDSCs (gr-MDSCs). Arg-1 expression in gr-MDSCs was reduced by radiation and preserved by supplementation with soy isoflavones. A persistent increase in Arg-1+ cells was observed in lung tissue treated with combined radiation and soy isoflavones at early and late time points, compared to radiation alone. The increase in Arg-1 expression mediated by soy isoflavones could be associated with the inhibition of radiation-induced activation of NF-κB and the control of pro-inflammatory cytokine production demonstrated in this study. CONCLUSION: A radioprotective mechanism of soy isoflavones may involve the promotion of Arg-1-expressing gr-MDSCs that could play a role in downregulation of inflammation and lung radioprotection."

One major subtype of phytoestrogens includes isoflavones and they are scientifically validated for their beneficial actions on many hormone-dependent conditions. OBJECTIVE: The present study examines the effect of soy isoflavones on letrozole-induced polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCOS was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats with of 1 mg/kg letrozole, p.o. once daily for 21 consecutive days. Soy isoflavones (50 and 100 mg/kg) was administered for 14 days after PCOS induction. Physical parameters (body weight, oestrous cycle determination, ovary and uterus weight) metabolic parameters (oral glucose tolerance test, total cholesterol), steroidal hormone profile (testosterone and 17β-oestradiol), steroidogenic enzymes (3β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (HSD) and 17β-HSD), oxidative stress and histopathology of ovary were studied. RESULTS: Soy isoflavones (100 mg/kg) treatment significantly altered the letrozole-induced PCOS symptoms as observed by decreased body weight gain (p < 0.05), percentage diestrous phase (p < 0.001), testosterone (p < 0.001), 3β-HSD (p < 0.01) and 17β-HSD (p < 0.001) enzyme activity and oxidative stress. Histological results reveal that soy isoflavones treatment in PCOS rats resulted in well-developed antral follicles and normal granulosa cell layer in rat ovary. DISCUSSION: Treatment with soy isoflavones exerts beneficial effects in PCOS rats (with decreased aromatase activity) which might be due to their ability to decrease testosterone concentration in the peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: Analysis of physical, biochemical and histological evidences shows that soy isoflavones may be beneficial in PCOS.",

Their potential beneficial or adverse effects in males like the prevention of prostate cancer or the impact on reproductive functions are controversially discussed. Major determinants of their bioactivity are the absorption and biotransformation of isoflavones. In this study, we focused on the influence of testosterone on plasma availability and phase II metabolism of isoflavones. Male Wistar rats, receiving an isoflavones rich diet, were randomized into three groups: Two groups were orchiectomized (ORX) at postnatal day (PND) 80 and treated for 11 days with testosterone propionate (TP) (ORX TP group) or a vehicle (ORX group) after a 7 days lasting hormonal decline. The third group served as control and remained intact. Rats were sacrificed at PND 98. ORX rats had reduced isoflavones plasma levels. Differently regulated mRNA expressions of transporters relevant for transport of phase II metabolites in liver and kidney may be responsible for this reduction, more precisely Slc10a1 and Slc21a1 in kidney as well as Slc22a8 in liver. While main phase II metabolites in intact rats were disulfates and sulfoglucuronides, the amount of sulfate conjugates was significantly diminished by ORX. In accordance with that, mRNA expression of different sulfotransferases was reduced in liver by ORX. The observed effects could be almost restored by TP treatment. In conclusion, testosterone, and likely further androgens, has a huge impact on phase II metabolism and availability of isoflavones by influencing the expression of different sulfotransferases and transporters.",

OBJECTIVE: The current study was performed to determine the effects of soy isoflavones on metabolic status of patients with PCOS. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on 70 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria who were 18-40 years old. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups to take either 50 mg/d soy isoflavones (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) for 12 weeks. Metabolic, endocrine, inflammation, and oxidative stress biomarkers were quantified at the beginning of the study and after the 12-week intervention. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of intervention, compared to the placebo group, soy isoflavone administration significantly decreased circulating serum levels of insulin (-1.2 ± 4.0 vs +2.8 ± 4.7 μIU/mL; P < .001) and homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-0.3 ± 1.0 vs +0.6 ± 1.1; P < .001) and increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.0009 ± 0.01 vs -0.01 ± 0.03; P = .01). Supplementation with soy isoflavones resulted in significant reductions in free androgen index (-0.03 ± 0.04 vs +0.02 ± 0.03; P < .001) and serum triglycerides (-13.3 ± 62.2 vs +10.3 ± 24.5 mg/dL; P = .04) compared to the placebo group. There was a significant increase in plasma total glutathione (+96.0 ± 102.2 vs +22.7 ± 157.8 μmol/L; P = .04) and a significant decrease in malondialdehyde levels (-0.7 ± 0.8 vs +0.8 ± 2.3 μmol/L; P = .001) by soy isoflavone intake compared with the placebo group. We did not observe any significant effect of soy isoflavone intake on other lipid profiles and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. CONCLUSION: Soy isoflavone administration for 12 weeks in women with PCOS significantly improved markers of insulin resistance, hormonal status, triglycerides, and biomarkers of oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The incidences of obesity and related diseases have reached epidemic proportions, and new therapeutic approaches are needed. Soy isoflavones have been identified as an important dietary factor for preventing and treating metabolic dysfunction. This study examined the effects of high doses of isoflavone on glucose and fat metabolism in a model of programmed obesity and evaluated its effects on the autonomic nervous system. METHODS: Litters of Wistar rats were standardized at nine pups per dam in normal litters (NL) or reduced to three pups per dam at the third day of life (P3) in small litters (SL) to induce postnatal overfeeding. Gavage with a soy bean isoflavone mixture (1 g/day) diluted in water was started at P60 and continued for 30 days. The control animals received vehicle gavage. At P90, biometric and metabolic parameters as well as direct autonomic nerve activity were measured. RESULTS: Increases in glycaemia and insulinaemia observed in SL rats were reduced by isoflavone treatment, which also caused lower glucose-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic islets. Sympathetic activity in the major splanchnic nerve was increased, while vagus nerve activity was reduced by isoflavone treatment. The dyslipidaemia induced by overfeeding in SL rats was restored by isoflavone treatment. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that treatment with isoflavone reduces adiposity and improves glucose and lipid metabolism. Collectively, these effects may depend on autonomic changes.",

Lipid homeostasis, closely involved in obesity, has been reported to be regulated by multiple pathways. mTORC1 is emerging as a critical regulator of lipid metabolism. Here, we describe that the consumption of soy isoflavones, with a structural similarity to that of estradiol, could mitigate obesity through an AKT/mTORC1 pathway. Fed with soy isoflavones, the diet-induced obesity (DIO) male rats exhibited decreased body weight, accompanied with suppressed lipogenesis and adipogenesis, as well as enhanced lipolysis and β‑oxidation. The phosphorylation of AKT and S6 were decreased after soy isoflavone treatment in vivo and in vitro, suggesting an inhibition effect of soy isoflavones on mTORC1 activity. Our study reveals a potential mechanism of soy isoflavones regulating lipid homeostasis, which will be important for obesity treatment.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies concerning about the relationship between soy isoflavone treatment and glucose metabolism were searched on MEDLINE and WEB OF SCIENCE (updated through April 2015) and EMBASE (1990-April 2015). Seventeen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total number of 1529 menopausal women were identified for meta-analysis. Soy isoflavones were found to show great significance for the improvement of glucose metabolism, though marked heterogeneity was found between studies. The overall results showed that the average difference in fasting blood glucose values between women assigned to soy isoflavones and women in placebo groups was -0.22 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.38 to -0.07 mmol/L) under a random-effects model. In addition, the effect of soy isoflavones on insulin was also significant: -0.43 μIU/mL (95% CI: -0.71 to -0.14 μIU/mL), as was the effect on homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR): -0.52 (95% CI: -0.76 to -0.28). CONCLUSION: Although the results displayed a significant tendency in favor of soy isoflavones, it appears that genistein alone played an important role in improving glucose metabolism due to its low heterogeneity.",

Since then, numerous clinical trials with various sources of isoflavones including soy and red clover have been presented, with practically all of the studies with adequate design delivering an outcome in favour of isoflavone supplementation. An in-depth risk assessment (EFSA 2015) concludes that the amply available human data does not indicate any suspected harmful effects from a potential interaction of isoflavones with hormone-sensitive tissues in the mammary gland, the uterus and the thyroid gland. Safety was ascertained with long-term intake of up to 150 mg isoflavones per day ingested for the duration of at least 3 years. Moreover, high isoflavone intake was found to have preventive effects with respect to breast cancer. Clinical findings indicate potential benefits of isoflavone exposure even during breast cancer treatment with tamoxifen or anastrozole.",

Soy isoflavones mitigate inflammatory infiltrates and radiation-induced lung injury, but the cellular immune mediators involved in the radioprotective effect are unknown. METHODS: Mice received a single dose of 10 Gy radiation delivered to the lungs and daily oral treatment of soy isoflavones. At different time points, mice were either processed to harvest bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for differential cell counting and lungs for flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry studies. RESULTS: Combined soy and radiation led to a reduction in infiltration and activation of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in both the bronchoalveolar and lung parenchyma compartments. Soy treatment protected F4/80CD11c interstitial macrophages, which are known to play an immunoregulatory role and are decreased by radiation. Furthermore, soy isoflavones reduced the levels of nitric oxide synthase 2 expression while increasing arginase-1 expression after radiation, suggesting a switch from proinflammatory M1 macrophage to an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype. Soy also prevented the influx of activated neutrophils in lung caused by radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Soy isoflavones inhibit the infiltration and activation of macrophages and neutrophils induced by radiation in lungs. Soy isoflavones-mediated modulation of macrophage and neutrophil responses to radiation may contribute to a mechanism of resolution of radiation-induced chronic inflammation leading to radioprotection of lung tissue.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is an age-related disorder that affects both women and men, although estrogen deficiency induced by menopause accelerates bone loss in older women. As the demographic shifts to a more aged population, a growing number of men and women will be afflicted with osteoporosis. Since the current drug therapies available have multiple side effects, including increased risk of developing certain types of cancer or complications, a search for potential nonpharmacologic alternative therapies for osteoporosis is of prime interest. Soy isoflavones (SI) have demonstrated potential bone-specific effects in a number of studies. This article provides a systematic review of studies on osteoporotic bone loss in relation to SI intake from diet or supplements to comprehensively explain how SI affect the modulation of bone remodeling. Evidence from epidemiologic studies supports that dietary SI attenuate menopause-induced osteoporotic bone loss by decreasing bone resorption and stimulating bone formation. Other studies have also illustrated that bone site-specific trophic and synergistic effects combined with exercise intervention might contribute to improve the bioavailability of SI or strengthen the bone-specific effects. To date, however, the effects of dietary SI on osteoporotic bone loss remain inconclusive, and study results vary from study to study. The current review will discuss the potential factors that result in the conflicting outcomes of these studies, including dosages, intervention materials, study duration, race, and genetic differences. Further well-designed studies are needed to fully understand the underlying mechanism and evaluate the effects of SI on osteoporosis in humans.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Soy isoflavones have been shown to be an alternative to hormone therapy at menopause, without causing side-effects such as breast cancer. However, the effects of early and late treatment with isoflavones on the mammary gland remain controversial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of early and late treatment with soy isoflavones on the mammary gland of ovariectomized rats. METHODS: Thirty 3-month-old rats were ovariectomized and divided equally into groups: Control, treated with vehicle solution; or with 150 mg/kg/body weight of isoflavones by gavage; or subcutaneously treated with 10 μg/kg/body weight with 17β-estradiol. Treatments started 3 days (early treatment) or 30 days (late treatment) after ovariectomy and lasted for 30 consecutive days. Thereafter, the animals were euthanized and the mammary glands were removed and processed for paraffin embedding. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histomorphometry or subjected to immunohistochemical detection of Ki-67 and VEGF-A. RESULTS: The ductal, lobular and total epithelial fractions were similar between controls and the early/late isoflavone groups, but they were significantly higher in the groups treated with estradiol. In both epithelial and stromal regions, the immunoreactivity of VEGF-A and the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells were significantly higher in the groups treated with estradiol, while they were similar in the early/late isoflavone groups and control groups. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that early and late treatment with soy isoflavones at the dose of 150 mg/kg/body weight does not show proliferative and angiogenic effects on the mammary gland of ovariectomized rats.",
