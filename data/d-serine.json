      "abstract": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR) is a key regulator of brain plasticity encoding learning and memory. In addition to glutamate, NMDAR activation requires the binding of the co-agonist D-serine. The beta-amyloid (Aß) peptide which accumulates in Alzheimer's disease (AD), affects the D-serine-dependent NMDAR activation in vitro, but whether this alteration would significantly contribute to AD-related pathophysiology and memory deficits remains unclear. Herein, we report a decrease in the maximal pool of recruitable NMDAR and in the expression of NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation together with impaired basal neurotransmission at CA3/CA1 synapses from hippocampal slices of 5xFAD mouse, an AD-related model with elevated Aß levels. The NMDAR synaptic impairments develop from 1.5 to 2 months of age with the initial rise of Aß and is correlated to a transient increase in D-serine levels. Deficits in working and spatial memories as well as cognitive flexibility then occurred in 10-12 months-old animals. Importantly, the NMDA-related synaptic deregulations (but not the altered basal neurotransmission) and behavioral impairments (working and cognitive flexibility) are prevented or reduced (spatial memory) in 5xFAD mice devoid of D-serine after genetic deletion of its synthesis enzyme serine racemase. Altogether, these results therefore provide in vivo evidence for the implication of D-serine at least in the early pathogenic signatures of AD driven by the increase in amyloid load suggesting that the recent proposal of preventive therapy of AD by administration of the precursor L-serine remains questionable.",

      "abstract": "Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission in the nervous system. In addition to NMDA receptor co-agonists, D-serine is a ligand for glutamate delta receptors (GluDs) and interacts with the ligand-binding domain with low affinity. However, D-serine binding does not lead to typical ion channel currents in GluD1 or GluD2 but may contribute to synaptic plasticity. In the developing brain, D-serine binding to GluD2 facilitates long-term depression at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses. However, the influence of D-serine on GluD1's interaction with its amino terminal domain synaptogenic ligand Cbln1 and its subsequent impact on synaptic function and behavior remains unexplored. Here, we found that D-serine inhibited the interaction between Cbln1 and GluD1 in an in vitro cell-binding assay. This effect was concentration-dependent, with an IC50 value of ~ 300 µM. Furthermore, in ex vivo central amygdala (CeA) slices application of recombinant Cbln1 (rCbln1), consistent with its synaptogenic property, produced a robust increase in excitatory neurotransmission and GluD1 expression. This effect of rCbln1 was partially blocked by pre-treatment with D-serine. Finally, in behavioral experiments, we observed that the pro-nociceptive effect of intra-CeA injection of rCbln1 was inhibited by pre-treatment with D-serine. In addition, the antinociceptive effect of intra-CeA rCbln1 injection in an inflammatory pain model was blocked by D-serine. Overall, these results demonstrated that D-serine binding to GluD1 reduces its interaction with Cbln1, which may be relevant to synaptic plasticity and behavior.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To establish a mouse model of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and assess the potential therapeutic benefits of D-serine supplementation in mitigating synaptic plasticity impairments induced by anti-NMDAR antibodies. Methods: Anti-NMDAR antibodies were purified from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and verified using a cell-based assay. CSF from patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases served as the control. These antibodies were then injected intraventricularly into C57BL/6 mice. Forty-eight hours following the injection, mice were administered either D-serine (500 mg/kg) or sterile saline intraperitoneally for three consecutive days. Subsequent analyses included Western blotting, immunofluorescence, electrophysiological studies, and a series of behavioral tests to assess pathological changes caused by anti-NMDAR antibodies. Results: Mice injected with anti-NMDAR antibodies exhibited a significant reduction in hippocampal long-term potentiation compared to controls, which was notably ameliorated by D-serine treatment. Additionally, these mice displayed decreased levels of hippocampal membrane NMDAR1 protein and postsynaptic NMDAR1 density. However, D-serine administration did not significantly alter these conditions. Notably, no significant behavioral differences were observed between mice injected with anti-NMDAR antibodies and controls in open fields, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition, or Morris water maze tests. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that exogenous D-serine can improve hippocampal plasticity impairments caused by anti-NMDAR antibodies but does not reverse the decreased expression of NMDAR. Furthermore, a single intraventricular injection of patients' antibodies was insufficient to induce anti-NMDAR encephalitis-related behaviors in mice."

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychotic disorder characterized by a disruption in glutamatergic NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission. Compelling evidence has revealed that NMDAR activation is not limited to L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and glycine since other free amino acids (AAs) in the atypical D-configuration, such as D-aspartate and D-serine, also modulate this class of glutamatergic receptors. Although dysregulation of AAs modulating NMDARs has been previously reported in SCZ, it remains unclear whether distinct variations of these biomolecules occur during illness progression from at-risk premorbid to clinically manifest stage. To probe this issue, we used High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to measure serum levels of D- and L-AAs that stimulate NMDARs across four groups of individuals diagnosed with (a) At-Risk Mental State (ARMS) for psychosis, (b) First Episode of Psychosis (FEP), (c) full-blown SCZ and (d) Healthy Donors (HD). We examined how diagnosis, demographic features, and antipsychotic treatment influence the variation of AA levels throughout psychosis progression. Finally, we explored the potential association between AA blood concentrations and clinical and cognitive measures related to psychosis. Our findings identified inter-group differences in serum AA composition, highlighting that the upregulation of D-serine/total serine and D-aspartate/total aspartate ratios represent a peculiar blood biochemical signature of early stages of psychosis progression, while increased L-glutamate, L-aspartate and glycine associate with chronic SCZ diagnosis. The present findings provide direct evidence for early dysregulation of D-AA metabolism and have potential implications for the identification of biomarkers for the early detection and staging of psychosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: D-serine and the D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) enzyme, which breaks down d-amino acids, may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia by affecting the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The exact role of D-serine and DAO, as well as the consequences of increased DAO activity in patients with schizophrenia, remain unclear. We aimed to investigate D-serine and DAO levels in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders before treatment and after six months of treatment. METHOD: Comparisons for the serum levels of D-serine and DAO were made between 81 healthy controls and 89 patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders without a history of treatment. Further comparisons were made after 6 months for changes in these levels in the 41 patients in follow-up. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), Calgary Scale for Depression in Schizophrenia (CDSS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), Global Assessment Scale (GAS), and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) were used to evaluate the symptom severity and functionality. Secondary results included comparisons related to antipsychotic equivalent doses. RESULTS: Before treatment, patients had significantly lower levels of D-serine, DAO, and D-serine/DAO ratio compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.001; p < 0.001; p = 0.004). DAO and D-serine levels of the patients were higher after six months of treatment (p = 0.025; p = 0.001). There was correlation of DAO levels with antipsychotic dosage and with PANSS negative and total subscale scores (rho = 0.421, p = 0.01; rho = 0.280, p = 0.008; rho = 0.371, p = 0.000). No correlation was found between serum D-serine level, DAO level, and the D-serine/DAO ratio with cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that D-serine and DAO may play a role that is sensitive to treatment effects in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact antipsychotic drugs have on NMDA receptor dysfunction, there is a requirement for studies that directly evaluates the activity of the DAO enzyme.",

      "abstract": "Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that for decades has been a mainstay of treatment for persistent bacterial infections. However, the spread of antibiotic resistance threatens its continued utility. In particular, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become a pressing clinical challenge. Vancomycin acts by binding and sequestering the intermediate Lipid II in cell-wall biosynthesis, specifically recognizing a D-alanine-D-alanine dipeptide motif within the Lipid II molecule. VRE achieve resistance by remodeling this motif to either D-alanine-D-lactate or D-alanine-D-serine; the former substitution essentially abolishes recognition by vancomycin of Lipid II, whereas the latter reduces the affinity of the antibiotic by roughly one order of magnitude. The complex of vancomycin bound to D-alanine-D-serine has been crystallized, and its 1.20 Å X-ray crystal structure is presented here. This structure reveals that the D-alanine-D-serine ligand is bound in essentially the same position and same pose as the native D-alanine-D-alanine ligand. The serine-containing ligand appears to be slightly too large to be comfortably accommodated in this way, suggesting one possible contribution to the reduced binding affinity. In addition, two flexible hydroxyl groups - one from the serine side chain of the ligand, and the other from a glucose sugar on the antibiotic - are locked into single conformations in the complex, which is likely to contribute an unfavorable entropic component to the recognition of the serine-containing ligand.",

However, data regarding blood D- and L-serine levels in PD are scarce. Here, we investigated whether the serum profile of D- and L-serine, as well as the other glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate ionotropic receptor (NMDAR)-related amino acids, (i) differs between PD patients and healthy controls (HC) and (ii) correlates with clinical-demographic features and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) in PD. Eighty-three consecutive PD patients and forty-one HC were enrolled. PD cohort underwent an extensive clinical characterization. Serum levels of D- and L-serine, L-glutamate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate, L-asparagine and glycine were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, no differences emerged in the serum levels of D-serine, L-serine and other NMDAR-related amino acids between PD and HC. However, we found that D-serine and D-/Total serine ratio positively correlated with age in PD but not in HC, and also with PD age at onset. Moreover, we found that higher LEDD correlated with lower levels of D-serine and the other excitatory amino acids. Following these results, the addition of LEDD as covariate in the analyses disclosed a selective significant increase of D-serine in PD compared to HC (Δ ≈ 38%). Overall, these findings suggest that serum D-serine and D-/Total serine may represent a valuable biochemical signature of PD.",

We here hypothesized that co-administration of NMDARs agonist (D-serine) and AMPARs endocytosis inhibitor (Tat-GluA23y) might be a potential target for alleviating memory impairment in sporadic Alzheimer model of rats. METHODS: Forty-eight female Wistar rats weighing 200-220 randomly divided into six groups. One month later, ovariectomized rats underwent stereotaxic surgery and were cannulated into the brain lateral ventricles. Streptozotocin was injected (3 mg/kg), then animals received the related treatments until the day 51, which experienced acquisition of spatial memory in Morris Water Maze test. Finally, the level of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus was measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: Co-administration of D-serine and GluA23y significantly enhanced the acquisition and retrieval of impaired spatial memory in ovariectomized rats with AD (p < .001). Compared to Glu-A 23, D-serine caused more improvement in the mentioned parameters above, however, these values for both groups were still significantly different from the control group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Simultaneous treatment with D-serine and GluA23y synergistically improved STZ induced spatial memory impairment in OVX rat, probably partly via increase in phosphorylated CREB protein.",

Yet, despite advances in knowledge about its function, there remains much more to be uncovered regarding the receptor's biophysical properties, subunit composition, and role in CNS physiology and pathophysiology. The motivation for this review stems from the need for synthesizing new information gathered about these receptors that sheds light on their role in synaptic plasticity and their dichotomous relationship with the amino acid d-serine through which they influence the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases like temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of adult epilepsies (Beesley et al., 2020a). This review will outline pertinent ideas relating structure and function of t-NMDARs (GluN3 subunit-containing triheteromeric NMDARs) for which d-serine might serve as an inverse co-agonist. We will explore how tracing d-serine's origins blends glutamate-receptor biology with glial biology to help provide fresh perspectives on how neurodegeneration might interlink with neuroinflammation to initiate and perpetuate the disease state. Taken together, we envisage the review to deepen our understanding of endogenous d-serine's new role in the brain while also recognizing its therapeutic potential in the treatment of TLE that is oftentimes refractory to medications.",

METHODS: In this study, 30 uremic patients with HI and 30 with normal hearing were selected. The basic conditions, biochemical indicators, and serum serine levels of the two groups were compared to analyze the influencing factors of HI. RESULTS: The age and d-serine levels were higher in the HI group, while the l-serine level was lower than uremia in the normal hearing group. Logistic regression analysis showed that d-serine level ≥10 μM and older age increased the risk of HI. The area of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve drawn by the prediction probability of HI was 0.838, indicating that age, d-serine, and l-serine had predictive diagnostic values for HI (p < .001). Among these, the ROC curve area of d-serine in predicting HI in uremic patients was 0.822 (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased d-serine and age are two risk factors for HI, while l-serine is a protective factor. d-Serine level has a predictive value for HI in uremic patients. Uremic patients are recommended hearing assessment, estimation of d-serine levels, and early intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia show reduced NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent auditory plasticity, which is rate limiting for auditory cognitive remediation (AudRem). We evaluate the utility of behavioral and neurophysiological pharmacodynamic target engagement biomarkers, using a d-serine+AudRem combination. METHODS: Forty-five participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to 3 once-weekly AudRem visits + double-blind d-serine (80, 100, or 120 mg/kg) or placebo in 3 dose cohorts of 12 d-serine and 3 placebo-treated participants each. In AudRem, participants indicated which paired tone was higher in pitch. The primary outcome was plasticity improvement, operationalized as change in pitch threshold between AudRem tones [(test tone Hz - reference tone Hz)/reference tone Hz] between the initial plateau pitch threshold (mean of trials 20-30 of treatment visit 1) to pitch threshold at the end of visit(s). Target engagement was assessed by electroencephalography outcomes, including mismatch negativity (pitch primary). RESULTS: There was a significant overall treatment effect for plasticity improvement (p = .014). Plasticity improvement was largest within the 80 and 100 mg/kg groups (p < .001, d > 0.67), while 120 mg/kg and placebo-treated participants showed nonsignificant within-group changes. Plasticity improvement was seen after a single treatment and was sustained on subsequent treatments. Target engagement was demonstrated by significantly larger mismatch negativity (p = .049, d = 1.0) for the 100 mg/kg dose versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate sufficient proof of principle for continued development of both the d-serine+AudRem combination and our target engagement methodology. The ultimate utility is dependent on the results of an ongoing larger, longer study of the combination for clinically relevant outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Some Escherichia coli strains harbour the pks island, a 54 kb genomic island encoding the biosynthesis genes for a genotoxic compound named colibactin. In eukaryotic cells, colibactin can induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and chromosomal instability. Production of colibactin has been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we demonstrate the inhibitory effect of D-Serine on the expression of the pks island in both prototypic and clinically-associated colibactin-producing strains and determine the implications for cytopathic effects on host cells. We also tested a comprehensive panel of proteinogenic L-amino acids and corresponding D-enantiomers for their ability to modulate clbB transcription. Whilst several D-amino acids exhibited the ability to inhibit expression of clbB, D-Serine exerted the strongest repressing activity (>3.8-fold) and thus, we focussed additional experiments on D-Serine. To investigate the cellular effect, we investigated if repression of colibactin by D-Serine could reduce the cytopathic responses normally observed during infection of HeLa cells with pks + strains. Levels of γ-H2AX (a marker of DNA double strand breaks) were reduced 2.75-fold in cells infected with D-Serine treatment. Moreover, exposure of pks + E. coli to D-Serine during infection caused a reduction in cellular senescence that was observable at 72 h post infection. The recent finding of an association between pks-carrying commensal E. coli and CRC, highlights the necessity for the development of colibactin targeting therapeutics. Here we show that D-Serine can reduce expression of colibactin, and inhibit downstream cellular cytopathy, illuminating its potential to prevent colibactin-associated disease."

      "abstract": "The retrieval of fear memories induces two opposing processes, reconsolidation, and extinction. The memory reconsolidation is an active process that involves gene expression and updates an existing memory. It is hypothesized that blockade of reconsolidation by manipulating the neurobiological factors, which are mechanistically involved in the process, could weaken or disrupt the original fear memory. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and hippocampal neurogenesis play crucial roles in hippocampus-dependent memory processes, including reconsolidation. Using contextual fear conditioning paradigm with multiple retrievals, we attempted to weaken the original contextual fear memory by repeatedly disrupting retrieval-induced reconsolidation via downregulation of NMDA receptor signaling and inhibition of neurogenesis. In the first experiment, prior to fear conditioning, NMDA receptor signaling was downregulated by the genetic reduction of its co-agonist, D-serine, and the neurogenesis was dampened by focal X-ray irradiation on the hippocampus. We found that simultaneous D-serine reduction and neurogenesis dampening resulted in a progressive decrease in freezing following each retrieval, leading to an attenuation of remote contextual fear memory on day 28. In the second experiment using the same behavioral protocols, after conditioning, pharmacological approaches were conducted to simultaneously block D-serine signaling and neurogenesis, resulting in a similar suppressive effect on the remote fear memory. The present findings provide insights for understanding the role of D-serine-mediated NMDA receptor signaling and neurogenesis in memory retrieval and the maintenance of remote fear memory, and improving the efficacy of exposure-based therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported an association between chronic renal failure and hearing impairment. Yet, the exact mechanism of action is still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the expression of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and D-serine in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) complicated with hearing impairment and further investigated the correlation between FGF23/D-serine and hearing impairment. METHODS: A total of 90 subjects, including 30 MHD patients complicated with hearing impairment, 30 MHD patients with normal hearing, and 30 controls, were included in this case-control study. Relevant data were obtained by questionnaire survey, audiometric test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine FGF23 level, and high-performance liquid chromatography to determine D-serine level. RESULTS: MHD patients showed abnormally high expression of FGF23 and D-serine, where FGF23 and D-serine levels were significantly higher in the group with hearing impairment than in the group with normal hearing and normal controls (all P<0.01). Also, elevated FGF23 and D-serine were identified as risk factors for hearing impairment in ESRD, with ORs of 16.54 (95%CI, 2.75-99.55) and 15.22 (95%CI, 2.59-89.51), respectively. Further Person correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between FGF23 and D-serine (r = 0.683, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study provides potential biomarkers for the early detection of hearing impairment complicated by chronic renal failure, and the reduction of FGF23/D-serine may provide a potential target for the treatment of hearing impairment complicated by chronic renal failure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Goal-directed attention involves the selective processing of behaviorally relevant sensory information. This selective processing is thought to be supported by glutamatergic and noradrenergic systems. Pharmacotherapies that simultaneously target these systems could therefore be effective treatments for impaired attention. AIMS: We first tested an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor co-agonist (D-serine) for effects on attention (processing speed and attentional lapses). NMDA receptor activation is thought to support noradrenergic effects on sensory processing; therefore, we tested a combination treatment comprising D-serine and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine). METHODS: D-serine was first tested in rats performing a two-choice visuospatial discrimination task. Combination treatments comprising relatively low doses of D-serine and atomoxetine were then tested in a separate group. RESULTS: In experiment 1, D-serine reduced the skew of initiation time (IT) distributions (IT devmode) at the highest dose tested (300 mg/kg). In experiment 2, low-dose D-serine (125 mg/kg) had no effect, while low-dose atomoxetine (0.3 mg/kg) reduced IT devmode and slowed movement speed. Importantly, the combination of these relatively low doses of D-serine and atomoxetine reduced IT devmode more than either drug alone without further slowing movement speed. CONCLUSIONS: IT devmode is thought to reflect attentional lapses; therefore, D-serine's effects on IT devmode suggest that NMDA receptors are involved in the preparatory deployment of attention. Greater effects following a combination of D-serine and atomoxetine suggest that preparatory attention can be facilitated by targeting glutamatergic and noradrenergic systems simultaneously. These results could inform the development of improved treatments for individuals with ADHD who experience abnormally high attentional lapses.",

Whether this deregulation may be used to initiate pharmacological strategies has yet to be considered. To this end, we performed electrophysiological extracellular recordings at CA3/CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices from young and aged mice. We show that 0.1 nM of the soluble N-terminal recombinant fragment of the secreted amyloid-protein precursor-α (sAPPα) added in the bath significantly increased NMDAR activation in aged but not adult mice without impacting basal synaptic transmission. In addition, sAPPα rescued the age-related deficit of theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation. Significant NMDAR improvement occurred in adult mice when sAPPα was raised to 1 nM, and this effect was drastically reduced in transgenic mice deprived of D-serine through genetic deletion of the synthesizing enzyme serine racemase. Altogether, these results emphasize the interest to consider sAPPα treatment targeting D-serine-dependent NMDAR deregulation to alleviate cognitive aging.",

While loss of GluN1 subunits in mice results in neonatal death due to respiratory failure, animals that lack a d-serine synthetic enzyme, serine racemase (SR), show grossly normal growth. However, SR-independent origins of d-serine in the brain remain unclarified. In the present study, we investigated the origin of brain d-serine in mice. Loss of SR significantly reduced d-serine in the cerebral cortex, but a portion of d-serine remained in both neonates and adults. Although d-serine was also produced by intestinal bacteria, germ-free experiments did not influence d-serine levels in the cerebral cortex. In addition, treatment of SR-knockout mice with antibiotics showed a significant reduction of intestinal d-serine, but no reduction in the brain. On the other hand, restriction of dietary intake reduced systemic circulation of d-serine and resulted in a slight decrease of d-serine in the cerebral cortex, but did not account for brain d-serine found in the SR-knockout mice. Therefore, our findings show that endogenous d-serine of non-SR origin exists in the brain. Such previously unrecognized, SR-independent, endogenous d-serine may contribute baseline activity of NMDARs, especially in developing brain, which has minimal SR expression.",

Antipsychotics (APs) of the first and new generations as the first-line treatment of Sch are not effective in about a third of cases and are also unable to treat negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenics. This explains the search for new therapeutic strategies for a disease-modifying therapy for treatment-resistant Sch (TRS). Biological compounds are of great interest to researchers and clinicians, among which D-Serine (D-Ser) and D-Aspartate (D-Asp) are among the promising ones. The Sch glutamate theory suggests that neurotransmission dysfunction caused by glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) may represent a primary deficiency in this mental disorder and play an important role in the development of TRS. D-Ser and D-Asp are direct NMDAR agonists and may be involved in modulating the functional activity of dopaminergic neurons. This narrative review demonstrates both the biological role of D-Ser and D-Asp in the normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) and in the pathogenesis of Sch and TRS. Particular attention is paid to D-Ser and D-Asp as promising components of a nutritive disease-modifying therapy for TRS.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of NMDA receptors agonists (d-Serine) and antagonists (MK801) on spermatogonia differentiation on decellularization testicular matrix (DTM) hydrogel scaffold. Four treatment groups were planned: 2D + D-Serine, 3D + D-Serine, 2D + MK801, and 3D + MK801. Results showed that cell viability was significantly decreased after 48 h in the 3D + D-Serine group and after 24 and 48 h in the 3D + MK801 group compared to the controls. The spermatogonia proliferation after two, four, and eight weeks was significantly increased in the 3D + D-Serine culture, while it was significantly reduced in the 2D + MK801 and 3D + MK801 groups after four and eight weeks. Real-time PCR results demonstrated that pre-meiotic gene (Plzf) expression was significantly increased only in the 3D + D-Serine culture compared to the control groups after four weeks of culture. The meiotic gene (Sycp3) expression was significantly increased in the 2D + D-Serine and 3D + D-Serine compared to the 2D controls after four and eight weeks. The post-meiotic gene (Tnp1) level in the 3D + D-Serine was significantly higher than the other groups. Flow-cytometry results indicated that the protein expression of Plzf (after four and eight weeks), Sycp3 (after eight weeks), and Tnp1 (after eight weeks) in the d-Serine-treated groups was significantly increased compared with the 2D control groups. There were not any significant changes in the gene expression of spermatogenic-related markers in MK801 culture media. However, a significant decrease in the protein levels of Plzf after eight weeks and Sycp3 after four and eight weeks was observed. In conclusion, the addition of NMDARs agonists (d-Serine) could be used to regulate the differentiation of spermatogonia in the 3D culture system.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a debilitating aspect of aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species, neuroinflammation, and astrogliosis. This study investigated the effects of decreased mitochondrial antioxidant response specifically in astrocytes on cognitive performance and neuronal function in C57BL/6J mice using a tamoxifen-inducible astrocyte-specific knockout of manganese superoxide dismutase (aSOD2-KO), a mitochondrial matrix antioxidant that detoxifies superoxide generated during mitochondrial respiration. We reduced astrocyte SOD2 levels in male and female mice at 11-12 months of age and tested in an automated home cage (PhenoTyper) apparatus for diurnal patterns, spatial learning, and memory function at 15 months of age. aSOD2-KO impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory and decreased cognitive flexibility in the reversal phase of the testing paradigm in males. Female aSOD2-KO showed no learning and memory deficits compared with age-matched controls despite significant reduction in hippocampal SOD2 expression. aSOD2-KO males further showed decreased hippocampal long-term potentiation, but paired-pulse facilitation was unaffected. Levels of d-serine, an NMDA receptor coagonist, were also reduced in aSOD2-KO mice, but female knockouts showed a compensatory increase in serine racemase expression. Furthermore, aSOD2-KO mice demonstrated increased density of astrocytes, indicative of astrogliosis, in the hippocampus compared with age-matched controls. These data demonstrate that reduction in mitochondrial antioxidant stress response in astrocytes recapitulates age-related deficits in cognitive function, d-serine availability, and astrogliosis. Therefore, improving astrocyte mitochondrial homeostasis may provide a therapeutic target for intervention for cognitive impairment in aging.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Diminished antioxidant response is associated with increased astrogliosis in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. Manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) is an antioxidant in the mitochondrial matrix that detoxifies superoxide and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis. We show that astrocytic ablation of SOD2 impairs hippocampal-dependent plasticity in spatial working memory, reduces long-term potentiation of hippocampal neurons and levels of the neuromodulator d-serine, and increases astrogliosis, consistent with defects in advanced aging and Alzheimer's disease. Our data provide strong evidence for sex-specific effects of astrocytic SOD2 functions in age-related cognitive dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Brain aging is a natural process that involves structural and functional changes that lead to cognitive decline, even in healthy subjects. This detriment has been associated with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction due to a reduction in the brain levels of D-serine, the endogenous NMDAR co-agonist. However, it is not clear if D-serine supplementation could be used as an intervention to reduce or reverse age-related brain alterations. In the present work, we aimed to analyze the D-serine effect on aging-associated alterations in cellular and large-scale brain systems that could support cognitive flexibility in rats. We found that D-serine supplementation reverts the age-related decline in cognitive flexibility, frontal dendritic spine density, and partially restored large-scale functional connectivity without inducing nephrotoxicity; instead, D-serine restored the thickness of the renal epithelial cells that were affected by age. Our results suggest that D-serine could be used as a therapeutic target to reverse age-related brain alterations.SIGNIFICANT STATEMENTAge-related behavioral changes in cognitive performance occur as a physiological process of aging. Then, it is important to explore possible therapeutics to decrease, retard or reverse aging effects on the brain. NMDA receptor hypofunction contributes to the aging-associated cognitive decline. In the aged brain, there is a reduction in the brain levels of the NMDAR co-agonist, D-Serine. However, it is unclear if chronic D-serine supplementation could revert the age-detriment in brain functions. Our results show that D-serine supplementation reverts the age-associated decrease in cognitive flexibility, functional brain connectivity, and neuronal morphology. Our findings raise the possibility that restoring the brain levels of D-serine could be used as a therapeutic target to recover brain alterations associated with aging."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the major cause of ESKD, requires kidney biopsy. d-Serine, present only in trace amounts in humans, is a biomarker for kidney diseases and shows potential to distinguish the origin of kidney diseases, whose diagnoses usually require kidney biopsy. We extended this concept and examined the potential of d-serine in the diagnosis of DN. METHODS: We enrolled patients with biopsy sample-proven DN and primary GN (minimal change disease and IgA nephropathy) and participants without kidney disease. A total of 388 participants were included in this study, and d-serine levels in blood and urine were measured using two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography, and urinary fractional excretion (FE) of d-serine was calculated. Using data from 259 participants, we developed prediction models for detecting DN by logistic regression analyses, and the models were validated in 129 participants. RESULTS: A d-serine blood level of >2.34 μM demonstrated a high specificity of 83% (95% CI, 70% to 93%) for excluding participants without kidney diseases. In participants with a d-serine blood level >2.34 μM, the threshold of 47% in FE of d-serine provided an optimal threshold for the detection of DN (AUC, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.95]; sensitivity, 79% [95% CI, 61% to 91%]; specificity, 83% [95% CI, 67% to 94%]). This plasma-high and FE-high profile of d-serine in combination with clinical factors (age, sex, eGFR, and albuminuria) correctly predicted DN with a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 72% to 99%) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI, 63% to 80%), and outperformed the model based on clinical factors alone in the validation dataset (P<0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of d-serine in blood and urinary excretion is useful in identifying DN in patients undergoing kidney biopsy. Profiling of d-serine in patients with kidney diseases supports the suitable treatment through the auxial diagnosis of the origins of kidney diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: d-serine, a long-term undetected enantiomer of serine, is a biomarker that reflects kidney function and disease activity. The physiologic functions of d-serine are unclear. METHODS: The dynamics of d-serine were assessed by measuring d-serine in human samples of living kidney donors using two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography, and by autoradiographic studies in mice. The effects of d-serine on the kidney were examined by gene expression profiling and metabolic studies using unilateral nephrectomy mice, and genetically modified cells. RESULTS: Unilateral nephrectomy in human living kidney donors decreases urinary excretion and thus increases the blood level of d-serine. d-serine is quickly and dominantly distributed to the kidney on injection in mice, suggesting the kidney is a main target organ. Treatment of d-serine at a low dose promotes the enlargement of remnant kidney in mouse model. Mechanistically, d-serine activates the cell cycle for tissue remodeling through an mTOR-related pathway. CONCLUSIONS: d-serine is a physiologic molecule that promotes kidney remodeling. Besides its function as a biomarker, d-serine has a physiologic activity that influences kidney function.",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) is a mild neurodevelopmental disorder with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity as its core symptoms. We previously revealed that an AD/HD animal model, juvenile stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Ezo) exhibited functional abnormalities in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the prefrontal cortex. D-serine is an endogenous co-ligand that acts on the glycine-binding site of NMDA receptors, which is essential for the physiological activation of NMDA receptors. We herein performed neurochemical and pharmacological behavioral experiments to elucidate dysfunctions in D-serine metabolism (namely, biosynthesis and catabolism) associated to AD/HD. The serine enantiomers ratio (D-serine/D-serine + L-serine, DL ratio) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HIP) was lower in SHRSP/Ezo than in its genetic control. The level of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO, D-serine degrading enzyme) was higher in the mPFC, and the level of serine racemase (SR, D-serine biosynthetic enzyme), was lower in the HIP in SHRSP/Ezo. Thus, changes in these enzymes may contribute to the lower DL ratio of SHRSP/Ezo. Moreover, a microinjection of a DAAO inhibitor into the mPFC in SHRSP/Ezo increased DL ratio and attenuated AD/HD-like behaviors, such as inattention and hyperactivity, in the Y-maze test. Injection into the HIP also increased the DL ratio, but had no effect on behaviors. These results suggest that AD/HD-like behaviors in SHRSP/Ezo are associated with an abnormal D-serine metabolism underlying NMDA receptor dysfunction in the mPFC. These results will contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of AD/HD and the development of new treatment strategies for AD/HD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: D-Serine is a crucial endogenous co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the central nervous system and can affect the function of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) system, which plays an essential role in modulating synaptic plasticity. The current study aimed to systematically evaluate the role and mechanisms of D-serine in depressive behavior in nucleus accumbens (NAc). METHODS: D-Serine concentration in the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model in NAc was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The antidepressant-like effects of D-serine were identified using forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) in control mice and then assessed in CSDS model. We applied social interaction and sucrose preference tests to identify the susceptibility of CSDS model. Western blotting was further performed to assess the changes of BDNF signaling cascade in NAc after CSDS and D-serine treatment. The BDNF signaling inhibitor (K252a) was also used to clarify the antidepressant-like mechanism of D-serine. Moreover, D-serine effects on synaptic plasticity in NAc were investigated using electrophysiological methods. RESULTS: D-Serine concentration was decreased in depression susceptible mice in NAc. D-Serine injections into NAc exhibited antidepressant-like effects in FST and TST without affecting the locomotor activity of mice. D-Serine was also effective in CSDS model of depression. Moreover, D-serine down-regulated the BDNF signaling pathway in NAc during CSDS procedure. Furthermore, BDNF signaling inhibitor (K252a) enhanced the antidepressant effects of D-serine. We also found that D-serine was essential for NMDARs-dependent long-term depression (LTD). CONCLUSION: D-Serine exerts antidepressant-like effects in mice mediated through restraining the BDNF signaling pathway and regulating synaptic plasticity in NAc.",

      "abstract": "Background:D-Serine, a direct, full agonist at the D-serine/glycine modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR), has been assessed as a treatment for multiple psychiatric and neurological conditions. Based on studies in rats, concerns of nephrotoxicity have limited D-serine research in humans, particularly using high doses. A review of D-serine's safety is timely and pertinent, as D-serine remains under active study for schizophrenia, both directly (R61 MH116093) and indirectly through D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitors. The principal focus is on nephrotoxicity, but safety in other physiologic and pathophysiologic systems are also reviewed. Methods: Using the search terms \"D-serine,\" \"D-serine and schizophrenia,\" \"D-serine and safety,\" \"D-serine and nephrotoxicity\" in PubMed, we conducted a systematic review on D-serine safety. D-serine physiology, dose-response and efficacy in clinical studies and dAAO inhibitor safety is also discussed. Results: When D-serine doses >500 mg/kg are used in rats, nephrotoxicity, manifesting as an acute tubular necrosis syndrome, seen within hours of administration is highly common, if not universal. In other species, however, D-serine induced nephrotoxicity has not been reported, even in other rodent species such as mice and rabbits. Even in rats, D--serine related toxicity is dose dependent and reversible; and does not appear to be present in rats at doses producing an acute Cmax of <2,000 nmol/mL. For comparison, the Cmax of D-serine 120 mg/kg, the highest dose tested in humans, is ~500 nmol/mL in acute dosing. Across all published human studies, only one subject has been reported to have abnormal renal values related to D-serine treatment. This abnormality did not clearly map on to the acute tubular necrosis syndrome seen in rats, and fully resolved within a few days of stopping treatment. DAAO inhibitors may be nephroprotective. D-Serine may have a physiologic role in metabolic, extra-pyramidal, cardiac and other systems, but no other clinically significant safety concerns are revealed in the literature. Conclusions: Even before considering human to rat differences in renal physiology, using current FDA guided monitoring paradigms, D-serine appears safe at currently studied maximal doses, with potential safety in combination with DAAO inhibitors."

      "abstract": "The role of the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) in the outer retina is unclear despite expression of the NMDAR-complex and its subunits in the outer retina. The flash-electroretinogram (fERG) offers a non-invasive measurement of the retinal field potentials of the outer retina that can serve to clarify NMDAR contribution to early retinal processing. The role of the NMDAR in retinal function was assessed using a genetic mouse model for NMDAR hypofunction (SR-/-), where the absence of the enzyme serine racemase (SR) results in an 85% reduction of retinal D-serine. NMDAR hypo- and hyperfunction in the retina results in alterations in the components of the fERG. The fERG was examined after application of exogenous D-serine to the eye in order to determine whether pre- and post-topical delivery of D-serine would alter the fERG in SR-/- mice and their littermate WT controls. Amplitude and implicit time of the low-frequency components, the a- and b-wave, were conducted. Reduced NMDAR function resulted in a statistically significantly delayed a-wave and reduced b-wave in SR-/- animals. The effect of NMDAR deprivation was more prominent in male SR-/- mice. A hyperfunction of the NMDAR, through exogenous topical delivery of 5 mM D-serine, in WT mice caused a significantly delayed a-wave implicit time and reduced b-wave amplitude. These changes were not observed in female WT mice. There were temporal delays in the a-wave and amplitude and a decrease in the b-wave amplitude and implicit time in both hypo- and NMDAR hyperfunctional male mice. These results suggest that NMDAR and D-serine are involved in the retinal field potentials of the outer retina that interact based on the animal's sex. This implicates the involvement of gonadal hormones and D-serine in retinal functional integrity.",

However, there are growing concerns that nanoparticles may exert toxic effects in the brain. In this study, we assessed direct nanotoxicity on microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, and indirect toxicity on neuronal cells exerted by silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles containing rhodamine B isothiocyanate dye [MNPs@SiO2(RITC)]. METHODS: We investigated MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-induced biological changes in BV2 murine microglial cells via RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based intracellular and extracellular amino acid profiling. Morphological changes were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Indirect effects of MNPs@SiO2(RITC) on neuronal cells were assessed by Transwell-based coculture with MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-treated microglia. MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-induced biological changes in the mouse brain in vivo were examined by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: BV2 murine microglial cells were morphologically activated and the expression of Iba1, an activation marker protein, was increased after MNPs@SiO2(RITC) treatment. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed lysosomal accumulation of MNPs@SiO2(RITC) and the formation of vesicle-like structures in MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-treated BV2 cells. The expression of several genes related to metabolism and inflammation were altered in 100 µg/ml MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-treated microglia when compared with that in non-treated (control) and 10 µg/ml MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-treated microglia. Combined transcriptome and amino acid profiling analyses revealed that the transport of serine family amino acids, including glycine, cysteine, and serine, was enhanced. However, only serine was increased in the growth medium of activated microglia; especially, excitotoxic D-serine secretion from primary rat microglia was the most strongly enhanced. Activated primary microglia reduced intracellular ATP levels and proteasome activity in cocultured neuronal cells, especially in primary cortical neurons, via D-serine secretion. Moreover, ubiquitinated proteins accumulated and inclusion bodies were increased in primary dopaminergic and cortical neurons cocultured with activated primary microglia. In vivo, MNPs@SiO2(RITC), D-serine, and ubiquitin aggresomes were distributed in the MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-treated mouse brain. CONCLUSIONS: MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-induced activation of microglia triggers excitotoxicity in neurons via D-serine secretion, highlighting the importance of neurotoxicity mechanisms incurred by nanoparticle-induced microglial activation.",

Though diet plays important roles in both the development and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), to our best knowledge, there has been no report on any potential interactions between D-amino acids and IBD. In this report, we aim to assess the effects of D-serine in a murine model of IBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To induce chronic colitis, naïve CD4 T cells (CD4+ CD62+ CD44low) from wild-type mice were adoptively transferred into Rag2-/- mice, after or before the mice were orally administered with D-serine. In vitro proliferation assays were performed to assess naïve CD4 T cell activation under the Th-skewing conditions in the presence of D-serine. RESULTS: Mice treated with D-serine prior to the induction of colitis exhibited a reduction in T-cell infiltration into the lamina propria and colonic inflammation that were not seen in mice fed with water alone or L-serine. Moreover, D-serine suppressed the progression of chronic colitis when administered after the disease induction. Under in vitro conditions, D-serine suppressed the proliferation of activated CD4 T cells and limited their ability to differentiate to Th1 and Th17 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that D-serine not only can prevent, but also has efficacious effects as a treatment for IBD.",

      "abstract": "Prefrontal control of cognitive functions critically depends upon glutamatergic transmission and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, the activity of which is regulated by dopamine. Yet whether the NMDA receptor coagonist d-serine is implicated in the dopamine-glutamate dialogue in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and other brain areas remains unexplored. Here, using electrophysiological recordings, we show that d-serine is required for the fine-tuning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuronal excitability, and synaptic plasticity in the PFC through the actions of dopamine at D1 and D3 receptors. Using in vivo microdialysis, we show that D1 and D3 receptors exert a respective facilitatory and inhibitory influence on extracellular levels and activity of d-serine in the PFC, with actions expressed primarily via the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling cascade. Further, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral assessment, we show that d-serine is required for the potentiation of cognition by D3R blockade as revealed in a test of novel object recognition memory. Collectively, these results unveil a key role for d-serine in the dopaminergic neuromodulation of glutamatergic transmission and PFC activity, findings with clear relevance to the pathogenesis and treatment of diverse brain disorders involving alterations in dopamine-glutamate cross-talk.",

      "abstract": "A core symptom that is frequently linked with dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in regard to schizophrenia is impairment or damage of executive functioning as a component of cognitive deficiency. The amino acid D-serine plays the role of an endogenous coagonist at the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glycine modulatory site. Considerably reduced serum levels of D-serine were found in patients suffering from schizophrenia compared with healthy control participants. An increase in D-serine led to augmented cognitive functionality in patients suffering from schizophrenia who were undergoing clinical trials and given the treatment of first- and second-generation antipsychotics. The study proposed the hypothesis that the D-serine blood serum levels may be linked with the extent of executive functionality in those suffering from the mental illness in question. For the purpose of examining executive function in such patients, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, Trail Making, and Wisconsin Card Sorting tests were applied (n = 50). High-performance liquid chromatography was used to gauge the total serine and D-serine levels. The extent of damage was examined through neuropsychological tests and was found to be considerably linked to D-serine serum level and the D-serine/total serine ratio (p < 0.05) in the sample being considered. A lower average serum level of D-serine and lower D-serine/total serine ratio were observed in participants with the worst performance compared with those displaying the best performance-this was true when the patients were split into quartile groups based on their results (p < 0.05). The findings of modified D-serine serum levels and the D-serine/total serine ratio linked to the extent of damage in executive functioning indicate that serine metabolism that is coresponsible for NMDA receptor dysfunction has been changed."

      "abstract": "Glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hyperfunction is known to contribute to acute renal failure due to ischemia-reperfusion and endotoxemia. d-Serine is a coagonist for NMDAR activation, but whether NMDARs play a role in d-serine-mediated nephrotoxicity remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that NMDAR blockade ameliorated d-serine-induced renal injury. In NMDAR-expressing LLC-PK1 cells, which were used as a proximal tubule model, d-serine but not l-serine induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, which was abrogated by the selective NMDAR blockers MK-801 and AP-5. Time-dependent oxidative stress, evidenced by gradually increased superoxide and H2O2 production, was associated with d-serine-mediated cytotoxicity; these reactive oxygen species could be alleviated not only after NMDAR inhibition but also by NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibition. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-δ and PKC-ζ is a downstream signal for NMDAR-mediated NOX activation because PKC inhibition diminishes the NOX activity that is induced by d-serine. Renal injury was further confirmed in male Wistar rats that intraperitoneally received d-serine but not l-serine. Peak changes in glucosuria, proteinuria, and urinary excretion of lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde were found after 24 h of treatment. Persistent tubular damage was observed after 7 days of treatment. Cotreatment with the NMDAR blocker MK-801 for 24 h abolished d-serine-induced functional insufficiency and tubular damage. MK-801 attenuated renal superoxide formation by lowering NOX activity and protein upregulation of NOX4 but not NOX2. These results reveal that NMDAR hyperfunction underlies d-serine-induced renal injury via the effects of NOX4 on triggering oxidative stress.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are not only present in the nervous system but also expressed in the kidney. Overstimulation of renal NMDARs leads to oxidative stress via the signal pathway of calcium/protein kinase C/NADPH oxidase in d-serine-mediated tubular cell damage. Intervention of NMDAR blockade may prevent acute renal injury caused by d-serine.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cortical temporal lobe brain tissue samples were collected from 20 patients with intractable epilepsy and 6 patients with brain trauma. The expression patterns of D-serine and NMDA receptor 1 were detected by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients (11 males, 9 females) were included in the present study. D-serine expression was significantly higher in the neurons and glial cells of patients with intractable epilepsy than in control individuals. The mean integrated optical density (IOD) value for the intractable epilepsy group (13.37 ± 1.88) was significantly higher than that for the control group (9.27 ± 0.62, p < 0.05). The mean absorbance value of the NMDA receptor 1 protein strip obtained from intractable epileptic patients was 0.4175 ± 0.2321, which was significantly higher than the value of 0.2402 ± 0.1458 for the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: D-serine and NMDA receptor 1 expressions increased significantly in patients with intractable epilepsy compared with control patients. Therefore, the D-serine signaling pathway may represent a potential neurochemical target for epilepsy treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although therapeutic agents for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are clinically available, MRSA infection is still a life-threatening disease. Bacterial attachment and biofilm formation contribute significantly to the initiation of MRSA infection. Controlling MRSA's attachment and biofilm formation might reduce the frequency of MRSA infection. According to recent data, some amino acids can reduce MRSA's attachment on plates; however, their precise inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, we explored the effect of the amino acids on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo MRSA infection models. METHODS: We tested the inhibitory effect of amino acids on MRSA and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the attachment assay. Moreover, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of amino acids on the in vivo catheter infection model. RESULTS: Among the amino acids, D-Serine (D-Ser) was found to reduce MRSA's ability to attach on plate assay. The proliferation of MRSA was not affected by the addition of D-Ser; thus, D-Ser likely only played a role in preventing attachment and biofilm formation. Then, we analyzed the expression of genes related to attachment and biofilm formation. D-Ser was found to reduce the expressions of AgrA, SarS, IcaA, DltD, and SdrD. Moreover, the polyvinyl chloride catheters treated with D-Ser had fewer MRSA colonies. D-Ser treatment also reduced the severity of infection in the catheter-induced peritonitis model. Moreover, D-Ser reduced the attachment ability of E. coli. CONCLUSION: D-Ser inhibits the attachment and biofilm formation of MRSA by reducing the expression of the related genes. Also, the administration of D-Ser reduces the severity of catheter infection in the mouse model. Therefore, D-Ser may be a promising therapeutic option for MRSA as well as E. coli infection.",

      "abstract": "Although exogenous D-serine has been applied as a neural regulatory intervention in many studies, the role played by D-serine in hippocampal injuries caused by lead exposure remains poorly understood. Rat models of chronic lead exposure were established through the administration of 0.05% lead acetate for 8 weeks. Simultaneously, rats were administered 30 or 60 mg/kg D-serine, intraperitoneally, twice a day. Our results showed that D-serine treatment shortened the escape latency from the Morris water maze, increased the number of times that mice crossed the original platform location, and alleviated the pathological damage experienced by hippocampal neurons in response to lead exposure. Although D-serine administration did not increase the expression levels of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B) in the hippocampi of lead-exposed rats, 60 mg/kg D-serine treatment restored the expression levels of NR2A, which are reduced by lead exposure. These findings suggested that D-serine can alleviate learning and memory impairments induced by lead exposure and that the underlying mechanism is associated with the increased expression of NR2A in the hippocampus. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of North China University of Science and Technology, China (approval No. LX2018155) on December 21, 2018."

      "abstract": "Entrainment of the hippocampus by the medial entorhinal area (MEA) in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, is believed to be mediated primarily through the perforant pathway (PP), which connects stellate cells in layer (L) II of the MEA with granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) to drive the hippocampal tri-synaptic circuit. Using immunohistochemistry, high-resolution confocal microscopy and the rat pilocarpine model of TLE, we show here that the lesser known temporoammonic pathway (TAP) plays a significant role in transferring MEA pathology to the CA1 region of the hippocampus independently of the PP. The pathology observed was region-specific and restricted primarily to the CA1c subfield of the hippocampus. As shown previously, daily intracranial infusion of d-serine (100 μm), an antagonist of GluN3-containing triheteromeric N-Methyl d-aspartate receptors (t-NMDARs), into the MEA prevented loss of LIII neurons and epileptogenesis. This intervention in the MEA led to the rescue of hippocampal CA1 neurons that would have otherwise perished in the epileptic animals, and down regulation of the expression of astrocytes and microglia thereby mitigating the effects of neuroinflammation. Interestingly, these changes were not observed to a similar extent in other regions of vulnerability like the hilus, DG or CA3, suggesting that the pathology manifest in CA1 is driven predominantly through the TAP. This work highlights TAP's role in the entrainment of the hippocampus and identifies specific areas for therapeutic intervention in dealing with TLE.",

      "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, with an unknown etiology. A hallmark of TLE is the characteristic loss of layer 3 neurons in the medial entorhinal area (MEA) that underlies seizure development. One approach to intervention is preventing loss of these neurons through better understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Here, we show that both neurons and glia together give rise to the pathology that is mitigated by the amino acid D-serine whose levels are potentially diminished under epileptic conditions. Focal administration of D-serine to the MEA attenuates neuronal loss in this region thereby preventing epileptogenesis in an animal model of TLE. Additionally, treatment with D-serine reduces astrocyte counts in the MEA, alters their reactive status, and attenuates proliferation and/or infiltration of microglia to the region thereby curtailing the deleterious consequences of neuroinflammation. Given the paucity of compounds that reduce hyperexcitability and neuron loss, have anti-inflammatory properties, and are well tolerated by the brain, D-serine, an endogenous amino acid, offers new hope as a therapeutic agent for refractory TLE.",

This project studies augmenting the efficacy of auditory neuroplasticity cognitive remediation (AudRem) with d-serine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) glycine-site agonist. We operationalize improved (smaller) thresholds in pitch (frequency) between successive auditory stimuli after AudRem as improved plasticity, and mismatch negativity (MMN) and auditory θ as measures of functional target engagement of both NMDAR agonism and plasticity. Previous studies showed that AudRem alone produces significant, but small cognitive improvements, while d-serine alone improves symptoms and MMN. However, the strongest results for plasticity outcomes (improved pitch thresholds, auditory MMN and θ) were found when combining d-serine and AudRem. AudRem improvements correlated with reading and other auditory cognitive tasks, suggesting plasticity improvements are predictive of functionally relevant outcomes. While d-serine appears to be efficacious for acute AudRem enhancement, the optimal dose remains an open question, as does the ability of combined d-serine + AudRem to produce sustained improvement. In the ongoing R61, 45 schizophrenia patients will be randomized to receive three placebo-controlled, double-blind d-serine + AudRem sessions across three separate 15 subject dose cohorts (80/100/120 mg/kg). Successful completion of the R61 is defined by ≥moderate effect size changes in target engagement and correlation with function, without safety issues. During the three-year R33, we will assess the sustained effects of d-serine + AudRem. In addition to testing a potentially viable treatment, this project will develop a methodology to assess the efficacy of novel NMDAR modulators, using d-serine as a \"gold-standard\"."

This study aimed to investigate that D-serine may ameliorate motor and cognitive impairment in Aβ injected mice by inhibiting JNK signaling pathway. Firstly, Kunming mice were injected intrahippocampally with Aβ1-42 to build AD model. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with saline, D-serine, D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), and Sodium benzoate (BE) for 10 consecutive days, respectively. Subsequently, the motor and cognitive functions of mice were detected by behavioral tests. The silver staining and immunohistochemical methods were used to detect the distributions of Aβ in the hippocampus of mice. 18F-2-Fluro-D-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scans were performed to detected glucose metabolism of Aβ1-42 induced lesions. The expressions of relative JNK factors were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot methods. These results showed that Aβ severely impaired the motor and memory abilities of mice. The expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1), phospho-JNK (p-JNK), p-c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) increased significantly. After D-serine treatment, the abilities of movement and memory of mice were improved, and the clearance rate of Aβ was accelerated. The expressions of GFAP, TNF-α, NMDAR1, p-JNK, p-c-Jun and ATF2 decreased significantly. DAAO and BE were administered to further validate these results. Therefore, this study showed that D-serine could alleviate the cognitive impairment of Aβ1-42 injected mice by inhibiting JNK signaling pathway. These results provide more evidences for the effect of D-serine on AD and relevant mechanism to treat AD.",

The hydrolytic enzymes called β-lactamases are responsible for a large proportion of the resistance phenotype. β-Lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) can be administered in combination with β-lactam antibiotics to negate the action of the β-lactamases, thereby restoring activity of the β-lactam. Newly developed BLIs offer some advantage over older BLIs in terms of enzymatic spectrum but are limited to the intravenous route of administration. Reported here is a novel, orally bioavailable diazabicyclooctane (DBO) β-lactamase inhibitor. This new DBO, ETX1317, contains an endocyclic carbon-carbon double bond and a fluoroacetate activating group and exhibits broad spectrum activity against class A, C, and D serine β-lactamases. The ester prodrug of ETX1317, ETX0282, is orally bioavailable and, in combination with cefpodoxime proxetil, is currently in development as an oral therapy for multidrug resistant and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales infections.",

Extracellular D-Ser concentration is modulated by ASCT neutral amino acid transporters. L-Theanine (L-Tea), a neutral amino acid component of green tea was reported to improve cognitive functions. We thus intended to investigate the possible inhibitory effect of L-Tea on the D-Ser uptake of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which was previously found as a good model of D-Ser transport into astrocytes. Cells were incubated with D-Ser and various concentrations of L-Tea or the reference compound S-ketamine (S-Ket). The effect on the uptake was assessed by measuring the intracellular D-Ser concentration using a capillary electrophoresis - laser induced fluorescence detection method. L-Tea competitively inhibited D-Ser uptake into SH-SY5Y cells with an IC50 value of 9.68 mM. Having previously described as an inhibitor of ASCT-2 transporter, S-Ket was intended to be used as a positive control. However, no acute inhibition of D-Ser transport by S-Ket was observed. Its long-term effect on the transport was also examined. No significant difference in D-Ser uptake in control and S-Ket-treated cells was found after 72 h treatment, although the intracellular D-Ser content of the 50 μM S-Ket pre-treated cells was significantly higher. L-Tea was found to be a weak competitive inhibitor of the ASCT transporters, while S-Ket did not directly affect D-Ser uptake or modify the uptake kinetics after a long-term incubation period.",

Thus, widespread adoption of d-serine as a biomarker can resolve the long-standing clinical challenge of the early detection and prognostic prediction of kidney diseases. Accuracy and reliability of the measurements are particularly important because these measurements will affect treatment decisions and thus impact the patient's emotional state and quality of life.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities in neurotransmission via N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) play a role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on NMDAR-related amino acids remains unknown. We aim to investigate the effects of rTMS on NMDAR-related amino acids in serum of post-stroke patients. METHODS: Ninety-five consecutive post-stroke patients with upper limb hemiparesis were recruited. In 27 patients, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score was 10 or higher. Twelve depressed patients underwent rehabilitation in combination with rTMS and 15 non-depressed patients underwent rehabilitation only without rTMS for 14 days. 1 Hz rTMS was applied to the primary motor area in the non-lesional hemisphere. BDI was conducted before and after treatment. Serum glutamine, glutamate, glycine, L-serine, and D-serine levels were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: There were no differences between depressed patients and non-depressed patients in clinical characteristics, levels of the five amino acids in serum, and the ratio of amino acids. However, in 27 depressed patients there was a significant correlation between levels of glutamate in serum and BDI (ρ=0.428、p=0.026). BDI decreased significantly in depressed patients after treatment with or without rTMS. D-serine decreased in the rehabilitation with rTMS group, but increased in the rehabilitation without rTMS group. L-serine increased in the rehabilitation with rTMS group, but decreased in the rehabilitation without rTMS group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rTMS can modulate NMDAR-related amino acids in blood, producing beneficial effects."

Blood D-/L-serine ratio has been identified to have a correlation with creatinine-based kidney function. However, the mechanism of distinctive behavior in serine enantiomers is not well understood. This study was performed to investigate the role of renal tubules in derangement of serine enantiomers using a mouse model of cisplatin-induced tubular injury. Cisplatin treatment resulted in tubular damage histologically restricted to the proximal tubules and showed a significant increase of serum D-/L-serine ratio with positive correlations to serum creatinine and blood urine nitrogen (BUN). The increased D-/L-serine ratio did not associate with activity of a D-serine degrading enzyme, D-amino acid oxidase, in the kidney. Screening transcriptions of neutral amino acid transporters revealed that Asc-1, found in renal tubules and collecting ducts, was significantly increased after cisplatin-treatment, which correlates with serum D-serine increase. In vitro study using a kidney cell line showed that Asc-1 is induced by cisplatin and mediated influx of D-serine preferably to L-serine. Collectively, these results suggest that cisplatin-induced damage of proximal tubules accompanies Asc-1 induction in tubules and collecting ducts and leads to serum D-serine accumulation.",

Chiral amino acid metabolomics revealed a prominent profile of D-serine in this patient. At the fulminant period of RPGN, the level of plasma D-serine, a potential biomarker in CKD that reflects actual glomerular filtration ratio (GFR), was extremely high. On the other hand, urinary fractional excretion (FE) of D-serine, which was usually much higher than that of L-isoform, was 0% in this patient. These abnormal D-serine profiles normalized in response to the intensive treatment. Normalizations of blood D-serine levels were in parallel with those of blood creatinine levels and potentially reflect the recovery of GFR. FE of D-serine increased transiently before the normalization of D-serine profile, suggesting that kidney promotes urinary excretion of D-serine for the normalization of plasma D-serine level. These unexplored clinical features of D-serine well reflected the clinical course of this patient. Blood D-serine level can also serve as a biomarker in acute kidney injury (AKI) or RPGN, and, in combination with FE of D-serine, may render the clinical practitioners to judge the efficacy of intensive treatments.",

      "abstract": "Dysfunction of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated transmission is supposed to contribute to the motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD), and to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Besides the main agonist L-glutamate, two other amino acids in the atypical D-configuration, D-serine and D-aspartate, activate NMDARs. In the present work, we investigated the effect of dopamine depletion on D-amino acids metabolism in the brain of MPTP-lesioned Macaca mulatta, and in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients. We found that MPTP treatment increases D-aspartate and D-serine in the monkey putamen while L-DOPA rescues both D-amino acids levels. Conversely, dopaminergic denervation is associated with selective D-serine reduction in the substantia nigra. Such decrease suggests that the beneficial effect of D-serine adjuvant therapy previously reported in PD patients may derive from the normalization of endogenous D-serine levels and consequent improvement of nigrostriatal hypoglutamatergic transmission at glycine binding site. We also found reduced D-serine concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid of L-DOPA-free PD patients. These results further confirm the existence of deep interaction between dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in PD and disclose a possible direct influence of D-amino acids variations in the changes of NMDAR transmission occurring under dopamine denervation and L-DOPA therapy.",

As an endogenous co-agonist of the NMDA receptor, D-serine has been suggested to play a role in epileptogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the effects of antagonizing two key enzymes in D-serine metabolism on the development of seizures and the downstream signaling. Our results showed that serine racemase (SR), a key enzyme in regulating the L-to-D-serine conversion, was significantly up-regulated in hippocampal astrocytes in rats and patients who experienced seizure, in comparison with control rats and patients. L-aspartic acid β-hydroxamate (LaaβH), an inhibitor of SR, significantly prolonged the latencies of seizures, shortened the durations of seizures, and decreased the total EEG power in rats. In contrast, D-amino acid oxidase inhibitor 5-chlorobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-ol (CBIO), which can increase D-serine levels, showed the opposite effects. Furthermore, our data showed that LaaβH and CBIO significantly affected the phosphorylation of Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK). Antagonizing or activating ERK could significantly block the effects of LaaβH/CBIO on the occurrence of seizures. In summary, our study revealed that D-serine is involved in the development of epileptic seizures, partially through ERK signaling, indicating that the metabolism of D-serine may be targeted for the treatment of epilepsy."

METHODS: The rat chronic intraocular hypertension (COH) model was generated as a glaucomatous animal model by cauterizing three episcleral veins. Quantitative analysis of RGC survival was determined by the counting of retrograde FluoroGold-labeled RGCs. The level of d-Serine in the retinas and aqueous humor was determined by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Retinal expression of serine racemase (SR) protein was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The TUNEL assay was used to detect cell apoptosis. RESULTS: The content of d-Serine increased significantly in the glaucomatous retina of the COH model 2 weeks after surgery compared with the control retina. d-Serine synthetase SR expression in the right glaucomatous eye increased slightly after surgery compared with that in the left control eye and remained at this high level for 6 weeks after surgery. SR-positive cells were located mainly in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the retina. d-Amino acid oxidase (DAAO) treatment significantly increased RGC survival in the glaucomatous eyes, and the TUNEL assay was used to confirm that DAAO reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in glaucomatous eyes. However, excess d-Serine could not exacerbate RGC loss in the COH model. CONCLUSIONS: Increased d-Serine and SR expressions in the retina of the COH model were detected. DAAO treatment significantly increased RGC survival in the glaucomatous eyes. These results suggest that decreased d-Serine expression has protective effects on RGCs.",

      "abstract": "In the mammalian brain, d-serine acts as a co-agonist at the glycine-binding site on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. Because plasma d-serine levels are significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy subjects, d-serine has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent for schizophrenia treatment. However, d-serine has a nephrotoxic effect in rats at high doses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the plasma kinetics of d-serine and nephrotoxicity in rats. We administered d-serine intravenously (iv), orally (po), or intraperitoneally (ip) to male Wistar rats, and performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure the plasma concentrations of d- and l-serine. After iv administration (0.1 mmol/kg body weight (bw)), plasma d-serine declined multiexponentially with an elimination t1/2 of 108 ± 16 min, and the total clearance was 7.9 ± 0.9 ml/min/kg bw. The oral bioavailability of d-serine was estimated to be 94 ± 27%. To evaluate the dose-response relationship of d-serine-induced kidney injury and the plasma kinetics of d-serine, we injected d-serine into rats ip in doses ranging from 0.6 to 4.8 mmol/kg bw. Twenty-four hours after d-serine administration, histological changes indicating renal damage were observed in the kidneys of rats who received d-serine at doses of 1.8-4.8 mmol/kg bw; the severity of the tubular injury increased with increasing d-serine dose. When the Cmax value of d-serine was approximately >2 μmol/ml, the plasma creatinine increased remarkably 24 h after d-serine administration. This suggests that the Cmax of d-serine could be a good predictor of d-serine-induced nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Extinction-based exposure therapy is widely used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). D-serine, an endogenous co-agonist at the glycine-binding site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR), has been shown to be involved in extinction of fear memory. Recent findings suggest that the length of time between the initial learning and an extinction session is a determinant of neural mechanism involved in fear extinction. However, how D-serine is involved in extinction of fear memory at different timings remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of D-serine in immediate, delayed and post-retrieval extinction (P-RE) of contextual fear memory using wild-type (WT) and serine racemase (SRR) knockout (KO) mice that exhibit 90% reduction in D-serine content in the hippocampus. We found that SRR disruption impairs P-RE, facilitates immediate extinction (IE), but has no effect on delayed extinction (DE) of contextual fear memories. The impaired P-RE of contextual fear memory in SRRKO mice was associated with increased expression of the GluA1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) in the hippocampal synaptic membrane fraction after P-RE, and this increase of AMPAR and impaired P-RE were rescued by the administration of D-serine to SRRKO mice. Our findings suggest that D-serine is differentially involved in the regulation of contextual fear extinction depending on the timing of behavioral intervention, and that combining D-serine or other drugs, enhancing the NMDAR function, with P-RE may achieve optimal outcomes for the treatment of PTSD."

      "abstract": "Neuroscience-guided cognitive training induces significant improvement in cognition in schizophrenia subjects, but the biological mechanisms associated with these changes are unknown. In animals, intensive cognitive activity induces increased brain levels of the NMDA-receptor co-agonist d-serine, a molecular system that plays a role in learning-induced neuroplasticity and that may be hypoactive in schizophrenia. Here, we investigated whether training-induced gains in cognition were associated with increases in serum d-serine in outpatients with schizophrenia. Ninety patients with schizophrenia and 53 healthy controls were assessed on baseline serum d-serine, l-serine, and glycine. Schizophrenia subjects performed neurocognitive tests and were assigned to 50 h of either cognitive training of auditory processing systems (N = 47) or a computer games control condition (N = 43), followed by reassessment of cognition and serum amino acids. At study entry, the mean serum d-serine level was significantly lower in schizophrenia subjects vs. healthy subjects, while the glycine levels were significantly higher. There were no significant changes in these measures at a group level after the intervention. However, in the active training group, increased d-serine was significantly and positively correlated with improvements in global cognition and in Verbal Learning. No such associations were observed in the computer games control subjects, and no such associations were found for glycine. d-Serine may be involved in the neurophysiologic changes induced by cognitive training in schizophrenia. Pharmacologic strategies that target d-serine co-agonism of NMDA-receptor functioning may provide a mechanism for enhancing the behavioral effects of intensive cognitive training.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive deficits, especially memory loss, are common and devastating neuropsychiatric sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The deficits may persist for years and may be accompanied by increased risk of developing early- onset dementia. Past attempts to reverse the neuropathological effects of brain injury with glutamate-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists failed to show any benefits or worsened the outcome, suggesting that activation, rather than blockage, of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) may be useful in the subacute period after TBI and stroke. Activation of the NMDAR requires occupation of the glycine-modulatory site by co-agonists to achieve its synaptic functions. Glycine and d-serine are endogenous ligands/co-agonists of synaptic NMDARs in many areas of the mature brain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of 6-chlorobenzo(d)isoxazol-3-ol (CBIO), an inhibitor of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), which degrades d-serine, on cognitive outcome in a mouse model of TBI. Because treating TBI animals with CBIO elevates the endogenous levels of d-serine, we compared this novel treatment with treatment by exogenous d-serine alone and combined with CBIO. The results show that a single treatment (24 h post-injury) with CBIO in the mouse model of closed head injury significantly improves cognitive and motor function, and decreases lesion volume and the inflammatory response. Moreover, the compound proved to be neuroprotective, as the hippocampal volume and the number of neurons in hippocampal regions increased. Treatment with CBIO boosted the NR1 and phospho- NR1 subunits of the NMDAR and affected the CREB, phospho-CREB, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) pathways. These findings render CBIO a promising, novel treatment for cognitive impairment following TBI.",

      "abstract": "Antipsychotic medications are inefficient at treating symptoms of schizophrenia (SCZ), and N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) agonists are potential therapeutic alternatives. As such, these agonists may act on different pathways and proteins altered in the brains of patients with SCZ than do antipsychotic medications. Here, we investigate the effects of administration of the antipsychotic haloperidol and NMDAR agonist d-serine on function and expression of three proteins that play significant roles in SCZ: nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP), dopamine D2 (D2) receptor, and disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1). We administered haloperidol or d-serine to male and female Sprague Dawley rats via intraperitoneal injection for 12 days and subsequently examined cortical expression of NOS1AP, D2 receptor, and DISC1. We found sex-specific effects of haloperidol and d-serine treatment on the expression of these proteins. Haloperidol significantly reduced expression of D2 receptor in male, but not female, rats. Conversely, d-serine reduced expression of NOS1AP in male rats and did not affect D2 receptor expression. d-serine treatment also reduced expression of DISC1 in male rats and increased DISC1 expression in female rats. As NOS1AP is overexpressed in the cortex of patients with SCZ and negatively regulates NMDAR signaling, we subsequently examined whether treatment with antipsychotics or NMDAR agonists can reverse the detrimental effects of NOS1AP overexpression in vitro as previously reported by our group. NOS1AP overexpression promotes reduced dendrite branching in vitro, and as such, we treated cortical neurons overexpressing NOS1AP with different antipsychotics (haloperidol, clozapine, fluphenazine) or d-serine for 24 h and determined the effects of these drugs on NOS1AP expression and dendrite branching. While antipsychotics did not affect NOS1AP protein expression or dendrite branching in vitro, d-serine reduced NOS1AP expression and rescued NOS1AP-mediated reductions in dendrite branching. Taken together, our data suggest that d-serine influences the function and expression of NOS1AP, D2 receptor, and DISC1 in a sex-specific manner and reverses the effects of NOS1AP overexpression on dendrite morphology.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating condition that is often refractory to standard frontline antidepressant therapy. A promising new approach to PTSD therapy is administration of a single sub-anesthetic dose of (R,S)-ketamine (Ket). The treatment produces rapid and significant therapeutic response, which lasts for only 4-7 days. In one of our studies, the mean duration of response was increased to 33 days when Ket administration was combined with a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, Trauma Interventions using Mindfulness Based Extinction and Reconsolidation (TIMBER). We now report the results from a 20-patient study, which examined the duration of sustained response with combined TIMBER-Ket therapy, TIMBER-K arm, relative to the response observed in a placebo-controlled arm, TIMBER-P. A significant difference in the duration of response was observed between TIMBER-K and TIMBER-P arms: 34.44 ± 19.12 days and 16.50 ± 11.39 days, respectively (p = 0.022). Previous studies identified a negative correlation between antidepressant response to Ket and basal plasma concentrations of d-serine (DSR). In this study, the basal DSR levels positively correlated with the pre-treatment severity of PTSD symptoms (Pearson's r = 0.42, p = 0.07) and patients with basal DSR level ≥ 3.5 μM displayed not only higher PTSD severity but also shorter duration of response. The data indicate that basal DSR levels may serve as a biomarker of the severity of PTSD symptoms and as a predictor of clinical response.

Importantly, cognitive impairment is a core feature of conditions, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and aging, and is associated to disturbances in NMDA-glutamate receptors. The d-serine pathway has been associated with cognitive deficits and these conditions, and, for this reason, d-serine signaling is subject of intense research to probe its role in aiding diagnosis and therapy. Nevertheless, this has not resulted in new therapies being incorporated into clinical practice. Therefore, in this review we will address many questions that need to be solved by future studies, regarding d-serine pharmacokinetics, possible side effects, other strategies to modulate its levels, and combination with other therapies to increase its efficacy."

      "abstract": "d-Serine is an amino acid and can work as an agonist at the glycine sites of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Interestingly, both types of glutamatergic modulators, NMDAR enhancers and blockers, can improve depression through common targets, namely alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionaic acid receptors (AMPARs) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). To elucidate the cellular signaling pathway underlying this counterintuitive observation, we activated NMDARs in rats by using d-serine. Saline, ketamine (NMDAR antagonist), and desipramine (tricyclic antidepressant) were used as controls. The antidepressant-like effects of all agents were evaluated using the forced swim test. The activation of the AMPAR-mTOR signaling pathway, release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and alteration of AMPAR and NMDAR trafficking in the hippocampus of rats were examined. A single high dose of d-serine exerted an antidepressant-like effect that was mediated by rapid AMPAR-induced mTOR signaling pathway and increased BDNF proteins, identical to that of ketamine. Furthermore, in addition to the increased protein kinase A phosphorylation of the AMPAR subunit GluR1 (an indicator of AMPAR insertion in neurons), treatment with individual optimal doses of d-serine and ketamine also increased adaptin β2-NMDAR association (an indicator of the intracellular endocytic machinery and subsequent internalization of NMDARs). Desipramine did not influence these processes. Our study is the first to demonstrate an association between d-serine and ketamine; following adaptative regulation of AMPAR and NMDAR may lead to common changes of them. These findings provide novel targets for safer antidepressant agents with mechanisms similar to those of ketamine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play pivotal roles in synaptic development, plasticity, neural survival, and cognition. Despite recent reports describing the genetic association between de novo mutations of NMDAR subunits and severe psychiatric diseases, little is known about their pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. Here we report a case study of a 4-year-old Rett-like patient with severe encephalopathy carrying a missense de novo mutation in GRIN2B(p.P553T) coding for the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR. METHODS: We generated a dynamic molecular model of mutant GluN2B-containing NMDARs. We expressed the mutation in cell lines and primary cultures, and we evaluated the putative morphological, electrophysiological, and synaptic plasticity alterations. Finally, we evaluated D-serine administration as a therapeutic strategy and translated it to the clinical practice. RESULTS: Structural molecular modeling predicted a reduced pore size of mutant NMDARs. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed this prediction and also showed gating alterations, a reduced glutamate affinity associated with a strong decrease of NMDA-evoked currents. Moreover, GluN2B(P553T)-expressing neurons showed decreased spine density, concomitant with reduced NMDA-evoked currents and impaired NMDAR-dependent insertion of GluA1 at stimulated synapses. Notably, the naturally occurring coagonist D-serine was able to attenuate hypofunction of GluN2B(p.P553T)-containing NMDARs. Hence, D-serine dietary supplementation was initiated. Importantly, the patient has shown remarkable motor, cognitive, and communication improvements after 17 months of D-serine dietary supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that hypofunctional NMDARs containing GluN2B(p.P553T) can contribute to Rett-like encephalopathy and that their potentiation by D-serine treatment may underlie the associated clinical improvement."

      "abstract": "The NMDAR is thought to play a key role in the refinement of connectivity in developing neural circuits. Pharmacological blockade or genetic loss-of-function manipulations that prevent NMDAR function during development result in the disorganization of topographic axonal projections. However, because NMDARs contribute to overall glutamatergic neurotransmission, such loss-of-function experiments fail to adequately distinguish between the roles played by NMDARs and neural activity in general. The gliotransmitter d-serine is a coagonist of the NMDAR that is required for NMDAR channel opening, but which cannot mediate neurotransmission on its own. Here we demonstrate that acute administration of d-serine has no immediate effect on glutamate release or AMPA-mediated neurotransmission. We show that endogenous d-serine is normally present below saturating levels in the developing visual system of the Xenopus tadpole. Using an amperometric enzymatic biosensor, we demonstrate that glutamatergic activation elevates ambient endogenous d-serine levels in the optic tectum. Chronically elevating levels of d-serine promoted synaptic maturation and resulted in the hyperstabilization of developing axon branches in the tadpole visual system. Conversely, treatment with an enzyme that degrades endogenous d-serine resulted in impaired synaptic maturation. Despite the reduction in axon arbor complexity seen in d-serine-treated animals, tectal neuron visual receptive fields were expanded, suggesting a failure to prune divergent retinal inputs. Together, these findings positively implicate NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission in developmental synapse maturation and the stabilization of axonal inputs and reveal a potential role for d-serine as an endogenous modulator of circuit refinement.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Activation of NMDARs is critical for the activity-dependent development and maintenance of highly organized topographic maps. d-Serine, a coagonist of the NMDAR, plays a significant role in modulating NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity in many brain areas. However, it remains unknown whether d-serine participates in the establishment of precise neuronal connections during development. Using an in vivo model, we show that glutamate receptor activation can evoke endogenous d-serine release, which promotes glutamatergic synapse maturation and stabilizes axonal structural and functional inputs. These results reveal a pivotal modulatory role for d-serine in neurodevelopment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate-type (NMDAR) function contribute to symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. The efficacy of NMDAR agonists in the treatment of persistent symptoms of schizophrenia has been variable, potentially reflecting limitations in functional target engagement. We recently demonstrated significant improvement in auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) with once-weekly treatment with d-serine, a naturally occurring NMDAR glycine-site agonist. This study investigates effects of continuous (daily) NMDAR agonists in schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: Primary analysis was on MMN after double-blind crossover (60mg/kg/d, n=16, 6weeks) treatment with d-serine/placebo. Secondary measures included clinical symptoms, neurocognition, and the effects of open-label (30-120mg/kg/d, n=21) d-serine and bitopertin/placebo (10mg, n=29), a glycine transport inhibitor. RESULTS: Double-blind d-serine treatment led to significant improvement in MMN frequency (p=0.001, d=2.3) generation and clinical symptoms (p=0.023, d=0.80). MMN frequency correlated significantly with change in symptoms (r=-0.63, p=0.002) following co-variation for treatment type. d-Serine treatment led to a significant, large effect size increase vs. placebo in evoked α-power in response to standards (p=0.036, d=0.81), appearing to normalize evoked α power relative to previous findings with controls. While similar results were seen with open-label d-serine, no significant effects of bitopertin were observed for symptoms or MMN. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent the first randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with 60mg/kg d-serine in schizophrenia, and are consistent with meta-analyses showing significant effects of d-serine in schizophrenia. Results overall support suggest that MMN may have negative, as well as positive, predictive value in predicting efficacy of novel compounds.

      "abstract": "AIMS: Reactive sulfur species, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and its oxydates, have been raised as novel redox signaling molecules. The present study aimed at examining whether endogenous sulfhydration signal is required for long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for memory. RESULTS: In this study, we found that increased synaptic activity triggered sulfide generation and protein sulfhydration. Activity-triggered sulfide production was essential for N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP via maintaining the availability of d-serine, a primary coagonist for synaptic NMDARs. Genetic knockdown of cystathionine β-synthase, not cystathionine γ-lyase, impaired LTP. H2S increased NMDAR-dependent LTP via sulfhydration and disinhibition of serine racemase (SR), a main synthetase of d-serine. We found that polysulfides also increased NMDAR-dependent LTP and NMDAR activity. In aged rats, the level of H2S and SR sulfhydration decreased significantly. Exogenous supplement of H2S restored the sulfhydration of SR, followed by the improvement of age-related deficits in LTP. Furthermore, boost of H2S signal in vivo improves hippocampus-dependent memory. Innovation and Conclusion: Our results provide a direct evidence for the biological significance of endogenous sulfhydration signal in synaptic plasticity. Exogenous supplement of H2S could be considered as the new therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurocognitive dysfunction after aging. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 27, 398-414.",

Substantial evidence suggests that d-serine, an endogenous co-agonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine site of the NMDA receptor, counteracts the antinociceptive actions of PGB at the level of the spinal cord. In the present study, we examined the impact of PGB treatment on spinal d-serine content and NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the superficial dorsal horn of peripheral nerve-ligated neuropathic mice. Mechanical allodynia was assessed using von Frey filaments. On post-surgical day 9 (after 5days of treatment with PGB [50mg/kg] or saline vehicle), the lumbar spinal cord was removed, homogenized, and ultrafiltrated. Supernatant samples were treated with Marfey's reagent and analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure d-serine content. In the electrophysiological experiments, tight-seal whole-cell recording was performed on neurons in the superficial dorsal horn of spinal cord slices. Partial sciatic nerve ligation increased spinal d-serine content, increased the NMDA/non-NMDA ratio of EPSC amplitudes, and slowed the decay phase of the NMDA component of EPSCs (NMDA-EPSCs). PGB treatment attenuated mechanical allodynia and reduced spinal d-serine content, decreased the NMDA/non-NMDA ratio, and shortened the decay time of NMDA-EPSCs. Furthermore, bath-applied d-serine attenuated the effects of PGB treatment. Although the precise mechanism for the effect of PGB on d-serine metabolism and abundance is unknown, the antinociceptive action of PGB likely involves the reduction of spinal d-serine content and subsequent attenuation of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the superficial dorsal horn.",

Juvenile offspring exposed prenatally to poly(I:C) showed reduced expression of NMDA receptor subunits in the hippocampus. Supplementing drinking water with D-serine (600 mg/L from P28 to P56) prevented the onset of cognitive deficits in adult offspring after MIA, in a significant manner. This study shows that supplementing offspring with D-serine during juvenile and adolescent stages could prevent the onset of psychosis in adulthood, after MIA.

      "abstract": "Dynamic synapses facilitate activity-dependent remodeling of neural circuits, thereby providing the structural substrate for adaptive behaviors. However, the mechanisms governing dynamic synapses in adult brain are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in the cortex of adult amyloid precursor protein knockout (APP-KO) mice, spine formation and elimination were both reduced while overall spine density remained unaltered. When housed under environmental enrichment, APP-KO mice failed to respond with an increase in spine density. Spine morphology was also altered in the absence of APP The underlying mechanism of these spine abnormalities in APP-KO mice was ascribed to an impairment in D-serine homeostasis. Extracellular D-serine concentration was significantly reduced in APP-KO mice, coupled with an increase of total D-serine. Strikingly, chronic treatment with exogenous D-serine normalized D-serine homeostasis and restored the deficits of spine dynamics, adaptive plasticity, and morphology in APP-KO mice. The cognitive deficit observed in APP-KO mice was also rescued by D-serine treatment. These data suggest that APP regulates homeostasis of D-serine, thereby maintaining the constitutive and adaptive plasticity of dendritic spines in adult brain.",

Although the therapeutic efficacy of d-serine supplementation is based on the d-serine deficit and NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis, it has not been confirmed whether d-serine levels are decreased in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. We searched the following electronic databases: Embase, Ovid Medline, and the Cochrane Library. A total of 20 studies were included in our meta-analysis. Serum d-serine levels were significantly decreased in patients with schizophrenia (standardized mean difference (SMD)=-1.008, 95% CI=-1.827 to -0.190). In the meta-regression analysis, male gender was positively correlated with serum d-serine levels (coefficient=0.190, 95% CI=0.070 to 0.311). d-Serine therapy combined with antipsychotics significantly improved negative (SMD=-0.319, 95% CI=-0.576 to -0.061) and positive (SMD=-0.211, 95% CI=-0.413 to -0.009) symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Our results suggest that decreased d-serine availability may justify combining d-serine therapy with antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "NMDA receptor dysfunctions are hypothesized to underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and treatment with D-serine (D-Ser), an NMDA receptor coagonist, may improve the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, upregulating the synaptic D-Ser level is a novel strategy for schizophrenia treatment. Na(+) -independent alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (asc-1) is a transporter responsible for regulating the extracellular D-Ser levels in the brain. In this study, we discovered a novel asc-1 inhibitor, (+)-amino(1-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)acetic acid (ACPP), and assessed its pharmacological profile. ACPP inhibited the D-[(3) H]Ser uptake in human asc-1-expressing CHO cells and rat primary neurons with IC50 values of 0.72 ± 0.13 and 0.89 ± 0.30 μM, respectively. In accordance with the lower asc-1 expression levels in astrocytes, ACPP did not inhibit D-Ser uptake in rat primary astrocytes. In a microdialysis study, ACPP dose dependently decreased the extracellular D-Ser levels in the rat hippocampus under the same conditions in which the asc-1 inhibitor S-methyl-L-cysteine (SMLC) increased it. To obtain insights into this difference, we conducted a D-[(3) H]Ser efflux assay using asc-1-expressing CHO cells. ACPP inhibited D-[(3) H]Ser efflux, whereas SMLC increased it. These results suggest that ACPP is a novel inhibitor of asc-1. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Enantiomeric separation of the D- and L-Ser derivatives occurred in the triazole-bonded column (R s: 1.85) with CH3CN/100 mM HCO2NH4 in H2O (95.5:4.5) as the mobile phase with isocratic elution. The ln(capacity factor of D-Ser) in the van't Hoff plot gradually decreased with the inverse of temperature, suggesting enhanced hydrophilic interactions with the triazole-bonded stationary phase with increasing column temperature, owing to decrease in the partition coefficient to the mobile phase. Multiple reaction monitoring (m/z 457.10 > 409.00) by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for quantifying D-Ser in human serum. The presence of D-Ser in the serum was confirmed by treatment with commercial D-amino acid oxidase. A linear calibration curve was constructed in the D-Ser concentration range of 0.5-5.0 μM (r (2) = 0.999, n = 3) using D-homoserine as the internal standard. The precision and recovery values were adequate for quantification. The detection limit for D-Ser was 1.1 fmol/injection (signal-to-noise ratio = 3), owing to the high CH3CN content in the mobile phase. The proposed LC-MS/MS method showed few fluctuations in the retention times of D- and L-Ser, and R s was stable until the 40th injection of serum without column washing, and thus can be useful for D-Ser determination in human serum in clinical research.",

      "abstract": "D-serine has been shown to improve positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms when used as add-on therapy for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, D-serine has to be administered at high doses to observe clinical effects. This is thought to be due to D-serine undergoing oxidation by D-amino-acid oxidase (DAAO) before it reaches the brain. Consequently, co-administration of D-serine with a DAAO inhibitor could be a way to lower the D-serine dose required to treat schizophrenia. Early studies in rodents to evaluate this hypothesis showed that concomitant administration of structurally distinct DAAO inhibitors with D-serine enhanced plasma and brain D-serine levels in rodents compared with administration of D-serine alone. In the present work we used three potent DAAO inhibitors and confirmed previous results in mice. In a follow-up effort, we evaluated plasma D-serine levels in monkeys after oral administration of D-serine in the presence or absence of these DAAO inhibitors. Even though the compounds reached steady state plasma concentrations exceeding their Ki values by >60-fold, plasma D-serine levels remained the same as those in the absence of DAAO inhibitors. Similar results were obtained with dogs. In summary, in contrast to rodents, DAAO inhibition in monkeys and dogs did not influence the exposure to exogenously administered D-serine. Results could be due to differences in D-serine metabolism and/or clearance mechanisms and suggest that the role of DAAO in the metabolism of D-serine is different across species. These data provide caution regarding the utility of DAAO inhibition for patients with schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) induce symptoms that closely resemble those of schizophrenia, including negative symptoms. D-serine is a naturally occurring NMDAR modulator that reverses the effects of NMDAR antagonists in animal models of schizophrenia. D-serine effects have been assessed previously for treatment of established schizophrenia, but not in the early stages of the disorder. We aimed to assess effects of D-serine on negative symptoms in at risk individuals. METHODS: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomised clinical trial at four academic US centres. Individuals were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were at clinical high risk of schizophrenia, aged between 13-35 years, had a total score of more than 20 on the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS), and had an interest in participation in the clinical trial. Exclusion criteria included a history of suprathreshold psychosis symptoms (ie, no longer qualifying as prodromal) or clinical judgment that the reported symptoms from the SOPS were accounted for better by another disorder (eg, depression). Randomisation was done using a generated list with block sizes of four. Participants were stratified by site, with participants, investigators, and assessors all masked through use of identical looking placebos and centralised drug dispensation to study assignment. D-serine (60 mg/kg) was given orally in divided daily doses for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was for negative SOPS, measured weekly for the first 6 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Participants who received at least one post-baseline assessment were included in analysis. Serum cytokine concentrations were collected at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint to assess the mechanism of action. Safety outcomes including laboratory assessments were obtained for all individuals. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT0082620. FINDINGS: We enrolled participants between April 2, 2009, and July 23, 2012. 44 participants were randomly assigned to receive either D-serine (n=20) or placebo (n=24); 35 had assessable data (15 D-serine, 20 placebo). D-serine induced a 35·7% (SD 17·8) improvement in negative symptoms, which was significant compared with placebo (mean final SOPS negative score 7·6 [SEM 1·4] for D-serine group vs 11·3 [1·2] for placebo group; d=0·68, p=0·03). Five participants who received D-serine and nine participants who received placebo discontinued the study early because of withdrawn consent or loss to follow-up (n=8), conversion to psychosis (n=2), laboratory-confirmed adverse events (n=2), or protocol deviations (n=2). INTERPRETATION: This study supports use of NMDAR-based interventions, such as D-serine, for treatment of prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. On the basis of observed effect sizes, future studies with sample sizes of about 40 per treatment group would be needed for confirmation of beneficial effects on symptoms and NMDAR-related inflammatory changes. Long-term studies are needed to assess effects on psychosis conversion in individuals at clinical high risk of schizophrenia. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health.",

      "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that activation of the spinal sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) plays an important role in the development of mechanical allodynia (MA) via secondary activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Sig-1Rs have been shown to localize to astrocytes, and blockade of Sig-1Rs inhibits the pathologic activation of astrocytes in neuropathic mice. However, the mechanism by which Sig-1R activation in astrocytes modulates NMDA receptors in neurons is currently unknown. d-serine, synthesized from l-serine by serine racemase (Srr) in astrocytes, is an endogenous co-agonist for the NMDA receptor glycine site and can control NMDA receptor activity. Here, we investigated the role of d-serine in the development of MA induced by spinal Sig-1R activation in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice. The production of d-serine and Srr expression were both significantly increased in the spinal cord dorsal horn post-CCI surgery. Srr and d-serine were only localized to astrocytes in the superficial dorsal horn, while d-serine was also localized to neurons in the deep dorsal horn. Moreover, we found that Srr exists in astrocytes that express Sig-1Rs. The CCI-induced increase in the levels of d-serine and Srr was attenuated by sustained intrathecal treatment with the Sig-1R antagonist, BD-1047 during the induction phase of neuropathic pain. In behavioral experiments, degradation of endogenous d-serine with DAAO, or selective blockade of Srr by LSOS, effectively reduced the development of MA, but not thermal hyperalgesia in CCI mice. Finally, BD-1047 administration inhibited the development of MA and this inhibition was reversed by intrathecal treatment with exogenous d-serine. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the activation of Sig-1Rs increases the expression of Srr and d-serine in astrocytes. The increased production of d-serine induced by CCI ultimately affects dorsal horn neurons that are involved in the development of MA in neuropathic mice.",

Regulatory roles of D-serine in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity have been reported. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether and how neonatal deficits in NMDA-receptor-mediated neurotransmission affect adult brain functions and behavior. Likewise, the role of D-serine during development remains elusive. Here we report behavioral and electrophysiological deficits associated with the frontal cortex in Pick1 knockout mice, which show D-serine deficits in a neonatal- and forebrain-specific manner. The pathological manifestations observed in adult Pick1 mice are rescued by transient neonatal supplementation of D-serine, but not by a similar treatment in adulthood. These results indicate a role for D-serine in neurodevelopment and provide novel insights on how we interpret data of psychiatric genetics, indicating the involvement of genes associated with D-serine synthesis and degradation, as well as how we consider animal models with neonatal application of NMDA receptor antagonists.",

In this study, we explored the efficacy of a glutamate agonist (D-serine) and antagonist (riluzole) as tic-suppressing agents in children with Tourette syndrome. METHODS: We performed a parallel three-arm, 8-week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled treatment study in children with Tourette syndrome. Each child received 6 weeks of treatment with D-serine (maximum dose 30 mg/kg/day), riluzole (maximum dose 200 mg/day), or placebo, followed by a 2-week taper. The primary outcome measure was effective tic suppression as determined by the differences in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale score; specifically, the total tic score and the combined score (total tic score + global impairment) between treatment arms after 6 weeks of treatment. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to analyze differences between each group and the placebo group. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (males = 21, ages 9-18) enrolled in the study; one patient dropped out before completion. Combined Yale Global Tic Severity Scale score and total tic scores improved in all groups. The 6-week mean percent improvement of the riluzole (n = 10), D-serine (n = 9), and placebo (n = 5) groups in the combined Yale Global Tic Severity Scale score were 43.7, 39.5, and 30.2 and for total tic scores were 38.0, 25.0, and 34.0, respectively. There were no significant differences in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale score or total tic score, respectively, between the riluzole and placebo (P = 0.35, 0.85) or D-serine and placebo (P = 0.50, 0.69) groups. CONCLUSION: Tics diminished by comparable percentages in the riluzole, D-serine, and placebo groups. These preliminary data suggest that D-serine and riluzole are not effective in tic suppression.",

It is reported that impairing glial functions with sodium fluoroacetate (FAC) impaired hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) and spatial memory retrieval. However, it remains unknown whether FAC impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning and/or memory, and if so, whether pharmacological treatment with exogenous d-serine can recuse the impairment. Here, we reported that systemic administration of FAC (3mg/kg, i.p.) before training resulted in dramatic impairments of spatial learning and memory in water maze and fear memory in contextual fear conditioning. Furthermore, the behavioral deficits were accompanied by impaired LTP induction in the hippocampal CA1 area of brain slices. More importantly, exogenous d-serine treatment succeeded in recusing the deficits of hippocampal LTP and learning and memory induced by FAC. Together, these results suggest that astrocytic d-serine may be essential for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory, and that alteration of its levels may be relevant to the induction and potentially treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders.",

Excessive receptor activation causes excitotoxicity, leading to various acute and chronic neurological disorders. Decrease in D-serine content may provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of the neurological disorders in which overstimulation of NMDA receptors plays a pathological role. Saccharomyces cerevisiaed-serine dehydratase (Dsd1p), which acts dominantly on D-serine, may be a useful D-serine reducing agent. We conjugated a linear 5-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) to Dsd1p (PEG-Dsd1p) and examined the effects of PEG-conjugation on its biochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. PEG-Dsd1p retained activity, specificity, and stability of the enzyme. The PEG modification extended the serum half-life of Dsd1p in mice 6-fold, from 3.8h to 22.4h. PEG-Dsd1p was much less immunogenic compared to the unmodified enzyme. Intraperitoneal administration of PEG-Dsd1p was effective in decreasing the D-serine content in the mouse hippocampus. These findings suggest that PEG-Dsd1p may be a novel tool for lowering D-serine levels in vivo.",

      "abstract": "Glutamatergic dysfunction, particularly the hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The positive modulation of the glycine site on the NMDA receptor has been proposed as a novel therapeutic approach for schizophrenia. However, its efficacy against negative symptoms, which are poorly managed by current medications, has not been fully addressed. In the present study, the effects of the positive modulation of the glycine site on the NMDA receptor were investigated in an animal model of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The subchronic administration of MK-801 increased immobility in the forced swimming test in rats without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity. The increased immobility induced by MK-801 was attenuated by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine but not by either the typical antipsychotic haloperidol or the antidepressant imipramine, indicating that the increased immobility induced by subchronic treatment with MK-801 in the forced swimming test may represent a negative symptom of schizophrenia. Likewise, positive modulation of the glycine sites on the NMDA receptor using an agonist for the glycine site, D-serine, and a glycine transporter-1 inhibitor, N-[(3R)-3-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yloxy)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)propyl]-N-methylglycine hydrochloride (NFPS), significantly reversed the increase in immobility in MK-801-treated rats without reducing the immobility time in vehicle-treated rats. The present results show that the stimulation of the NMDA receptor through the glycine site on the receptor either directly with D-serine or by blocking glycine transporter-1 attenuates the immobility elicited by the subchronic administration of MK-801 and may be potentially useful for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Hypofunction of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Many studies have investigated peripheral NMDA receptor-related glutamatergic amino acid levels because of their potential as biological markers. Peripheral d-serine levels and the ratio of d-serine to total serine have been reported to be significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. Peripheral d-serine levels and the d-/l-serine ratio have also been reported to significantly increase in patients with schizophrenia as their clinical symptoms improve from the time of admission to the time of discharge. In this study, we examined whether peripheral NMDA receptor-related glutamatergic amino acids levels were altered in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia compared to controls and whether these peripheral amino acids levels were altered by clozapine treatment. Twenty-two patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled. The plasma levels of d-serine, l-serine, glycine, glutamate, and glutamine were measured before and after clozapine treatment. We found that the plasma levels of d-serine and the d-/l-serine ratio were significantly lower in the patients before clozapine treatment than in the controls. The d-/l-serine ratio was significantly increased by clozapine treatment in patients, and no significant difference was observed in the plasma levels of d-serine and the d-/l-serine ratio between the patients after clozapine treatment and the controls. We also found that plasma glycine levels and the glycine/l-serine ratio were significantly increased following clozapine treatment in the patients, and the glycine/l-serine ratio was significantly higher in the patients after clozapine treatment than in the controls. There was no significant difference in the plasma levels of glutamate and glutamine both between the controls and patients and between before and after clozapine treatment. This study firstly demonstrated changes of d-/l-serine and glycine/l-serine ratio between before and after clozapine treatment, suggesting that the plasma d-/l-serine ratio and glycine/l-serine ratio could be markers of therapeutic efficacy or clinical state in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",

Employing a diabetic rat model, the present study was designed to determine whether the content of D-serine (D-Ser) in hippocampus is associated with the impairment of spatial learning and memory ability. METHODS: Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The insulin treatment began 3 days after STZ injection. RESULTS: We found that both water maze learning and hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) were impaired in diabetic rats. The contents of glutamate, D-Ser, and serine racemase in the hippocampus of diabetic rats were significantly higher than those in the control group. Insulin treatment prevented the STZ-induced impairment in water maze learning and hippocampal CA1-LTP in diabetic rats and also maintained the contents of glutamate, D-Ser, and serine racemase at the normal range in hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that insulin treatment has a potent protection effect on CA1-LTP, spatial learning and memory ability of the diabetic rats in vivo. Furthermore, insulin may take effect by inhibiting the overactivation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which play a critical role in neurotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.",

Arc protein is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) and colocalizes with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complex. Arc transcription is positively modulated by NMDAR activity and is important for dendritic spine plasticity. Genetic ablation of serine racemase (SR-/-), the enzyme that converts L-serine to D-serine, a coagonist at the NMDAR, reduces dendritic spine density in the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate that SR deficient (SR-/-) mice also have reduced Arc protein expression in the hippocampus that can be reversed with chronic D-serine administration in adulthood. Furthermore, D-serine treatment partially rescues the hippocampal spine deficit in SR-/- mice. These results demonstrate the importance of D-serine in regulating the hippocampal expression of Arc in vivo. In addition, our findings underscore the potential utility of using the glycine modulatory site agonist D-serine to treat disorders that exhibit Arc and dendritic spine dysregulation as a consequence of NMDAR hypofunction, such as schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Presynaptic NMDA receptors facilitate the release of glutamate at excitatory cortical synapses and are involved in regulation of synaptic dynamics and plasticity. At synapses in the entorhinal cortex these receptors are tonically activated and provide a positive feedback modulation of the level of background excitation. NMDA receptor activation requires obligatory occupation of a co-agonist binding site, and in the present investigation we have examined whether this site on the presynaptic receptor is activated by endogenous glycine or d-serine. We used whole-cell patch clamp recordings of spontaneous AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents from rat entorhinal cortex neurones in vitro as a monitor of presynaptic glutamate release. Addition of exogenous glycine or d-serine had minimal effects on spontaneous release, suggesting that the co-agonist site was endogenously activated and likely to be saturated in our slices. This was supported by the observation that a co-agonist site antagonist reduced the frequency of spontaneous currents. Depletion of endogenous glycine by enzymatic breakdown with a bacterial glycine oxidase had little effect on glutamate release, whereas d-serine depletion with a yeast d-amino acid oxidase significantly reduced glutamate release, suggesting that d-serine is the endogenous agonist. Finally, the effects of d-serine depletion were mimicked by compromising astroglial cell function, and this was rescued by exogenous d-serine, indicating that astroglial cells are the provider of the d-serine that tonically activates the presynaptic NMDA receptor. We discuss the significance of these observations for the aetiology of epilepsy and possible targeting of the presynaptic NMDA receptor in anticonvulsant therapy.",

      "abstract": "The influence of the gut microbiota on brain chemistry has been convincingly demonstrated in rodents. In the absence of gut bacteria, the central expression of brain derived neurotropic factor, (BDNF), and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits are reduced, whereas, oral probiotics increase brain BDNF, and impart significant anxiolytic effects. We tested whether prebiotic compounds, which increase intrinsic enteric microbiota, also affected brain BDNF and NMDARs. In addition, we examined whether plasma from prebiotic treated rats released BDNF from human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, to provide an initial indication of mechanism of action. Rats were gavaged with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) or water for five weeks, prior to measurements of brain BDNF, NMDAR subunits and amino acids associated with glutamate neurotransmission (glutamate, glutamine, and serine and alanine enantiomers). Prebiotics increased hippocampal BDNF and NR1 subunit expression relative to controls. The intake of GOS also increased hippocampal NR2A subunits, and frontal cortex NR1 and d-serine. Prebiotics did not alter glutamate, glutamine, l-serine, l-alanine or d-alanine concentrations in the brain, though GOSfeeding raised plasma d-alanine. Elevated levels of plasma peptide YY (PYY) after GOS intake was observed. Plasma from GOS rats increased the release of BDNF from SH-SY5Y cells, but not in the presence of PYY antisera. The addition of synthetic PYY to SH-SY5Y cell cultures, also elevated BDNF secretion. We conclude that prebiotic-mediated proliferation of gut microbiota in rats, like probiotics, increases brain BDNF expression, possibly through the involvement of gut hormones. The effect of GOS on components of central NMDAR signalling was greater than FOS, and may reflect the proliferative potency of GOS on microbiota. Our data therefore, provide a sound basis to further investigate the utility of prebiotics in the maintenance of brain health and adjunctive treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

The neurogenic niche regulates the stem cell proliferation and the differentiation and survival of new neurons and a major contributor to the neurogenic niche are astrocytes. Among the molecules secreted by astrocytes, D-serine is an important gliotransmitter and is a co-agonist of the glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. D-serine has been shown to enhance the proliferation of neural stem cells in vitro, but its effect on adult neurogenesis in vivo is unknown. Here, we tested the effect of exogenous administration of D-serine on adult neurogenesis in the mouse dentate gyrus. We found that 1 week of treatment with D-serine increased cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro and increased the density of neural stem cells and transit amplifying progenitors. Furthermore, D-serine increased the survival of newborn neurons. Together, these results indicate that D-serine treatment resulted in the improvement of several steps of adult neurogenesis in vivo."

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common disorders appearing following a stroke, and is also a major factor limiting recovery and rehabilitation in stroke patients. Antidepressants are the most common prescribed treatment for depression and have shown to have anti-inflammatory properties within the central nervous system (CNS). The major source of pro-inflammatory factors within the CNS is from activated microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS. Antidepressants have been shown to promote midbrain and hippocampal neuronal survival following an ischemic insult and this survival is mediated through the anti-inflammatory effects on microglia, but the effects on cortical neuronal survival after this insult have yet to be investigated. The present study aimed to test and compare antidepressants from three distinct classes (tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) on the release of inflammatory factors and amino acids from activated microglia and whether altering this release could affect cortical neuronal viability after an ischemic insult. Primary microglia were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS and/or 10 μM antidepressants, and the various factors released into medium were assayed. Co-cultures consisting of microglia and primary cortical neurons were used to assess the effects of antidepressant-treated activated microglia on the viability of ischemic injured neurons. Of the antidepressants tested, most decreased the release of the proinflammatory factors nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin 1-beta from activated microglia. Fluoxetine and citalopram, the SSRIs, decreased the release of the amino acids glutamate and d-serine from LPS-activated microglia. oxygen-glucose deprived (OGD) cortical neurons cocultured with LPS-activated microglia pre-treated with fluoxetine and citalopram showed greater survival compared to injured neurons co-cultured with untreated activated microglia. Microglial release of glutamate and d-serine was shown to be the most important factor mediating neuronal survival following antagonism studies. To our knowledge, our results demonstrate for the first time that fluoxetine and citalopram decrease the release of glutamate and d-serine from LPS-activated microglia and this causes an increase in the survival of OGD-injured cortical neurons after co-culture.",

Given the role of D-serine in both neurodevelopment and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, we examined whether neonatal disruption of D-serine synthesis by SRR inhibition could induce behavioral abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia, in later life. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Neonatal mice (7-9 days) were injected with vehicle or phenazine methosulfate (Met-Phen: 3 mg/kg/day), an SRR inhibitor. Behavioral evaluations, such as spontaneous locomotion, novel object recognition test (NORT), and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were performed at juvenile (5-6 weeks old) and adult (10-12 weeks old) stages. In addition, we tested the effects of D-serine on PPI deficits in adult mice after neonatal Met-Phen exposure. Finally, we assessed whether D-serine could prevent the onset of schizophrenia-like behavior in these mice. Neonatal Met-Phen treatment reduced D-serine levels in the brain, 24 hours after the final dose. Additionally, this treatment caused behavioral abnormalities relevant to prodromal symptoms in juveniles and to schizophrenia in adults. A single dose of D-serine improved PPI deficits in adult mice. Interestingly, chronic administration of D-serine (900 mg/kg/day from P35 to P70) significantly prevented the onset of PPI deficits after neonatal Met-Phen exposure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that disruption of D-serine synthesis during developmental stages leads to behavioral abnormalities relevant to prodromal symptoms and schizophrenia, in later life. Furthermore, early pharmacological intervention with D-serine may prevent the onset of psychosis in adult.",

      "abstract": "Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (polyI:C) is a synthetic analog that elicits viral-like immune responses in mammals. We have recently found that polyI:C treatment in neonatal mice induced abnormalities of emotional, cognitive, and sensorimotor gating and dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission in adulthood. In this study, we investigated the effect of the NMDA-receptor co-agonist D-serine on polyI:C-induced behavioral abnormalities in mice. Neonatal ICR mice were repeatedly injected with polyI:C for 5 days from postnatal day 2 to 6. At 10 weeks, sensorimotor gating function was analyzed in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) test. Emotional function was analyzed in open field and social interaction tests. Cognitive function was analyzed by novel object recognition tests. D-Serine dose-dependently improved polyI:C-induced impairment of emotional and cognitive behaviors whereas it had no effect on PPI deficit in adults. The ameliorating effects of D-serine were antagonized by pretreatment with an NMDA-receptor antagonist, MK-801. Although the mRNA level of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) was increased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of neonatal polyI:C-treated mice in adulthood, no changes were observed in D-serine content and DAAO enzymatic activity. These results suggest that D-serine ameliorates emotional and cognitive impairments of the polyI:C-treated mice through potentiating NMDA receptor activity.",

      "abstract": "The combination of pharmacotherapy and cognitive retraining (CRT) for the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia may be more efficacious than either approach alone, but this has not yet been tested. This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 12 weeks of D-serine, combined with CRT in the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia at two academic sites in parallel, in India and the United States. In a randomized, partial double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design, 104 schizophrenia subjects (US site=22, Indian site=82) were randomized to: (1) D-serine (30 mg/kg)+CRT (5 h/week), (2) D-serine+control CRT, (3) CRT+placebo D-serine, and (4) placebo+control CRT. Completion rates were 84 and 100% in the Indian and US samples, respectively. On various outcome measures of safety and tolerability, the interventions were well tolerated. D-Serine and CRT did not show any significant effect on the Global Cognitive Index, although both interventions showed differential site effects on individual test performance. CRT resulted in a significant improvement in Verbal Working Memory, and a trend toward improvement in Attention/Vigilance. This is the first study to demonstrating the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of combination pharmacotherapy and CRT in a multicenter international clinical trial. These preliminary findings provide support for future studies using higher doses of D-serine that have been shown to be efficacious or other pharmacotherapies, along with the newer cognitive remediation strategies that are individualized and that target basic information processing.",

Here we studied plasma levels of D-serine and L-serine in 84 Brazilian individuals with schizophrenia and 75 gender- and age-matched controls. Plasma levels of D-serine and the ratio of plasma D-serine to total serine were significantly lower in individuals with schizophrenia as compared to the control group. Levels of D-serine were significantly and negatively correlated to the severity of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. We also observed that plasma levels of D-serine significantly decreased with aging in healthy controls.

      "abstract": "Considering the lengthy history of pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, the development of novel antipsychotic agents targeting the glutamatergic system is relatively new. A glutamatergic deficit has been proposed to underlie many of the symptoms typically observed in schizophrenia, particularly the negative and cognitive symptoms (which are less likely to respond to current treatments). D-serine is an important coagonist of the glutamate NMDA receptor, and accumulating evidence suggests that D-serine levels and/or activity may be dysfunctional in schizophrenia and that facilitation of D-serine transmission could provide a significant therapeutic breakthrough, especially where conventional treatments have fallen short. A summary of the relevant animal data, as well as genetic studies and clinical trials examining D-serine as an adjunct to standard antipsychotic therapy, is provided in this article. Together, the evidence suggests that research on the next generation of antipsychotic agents should include studies on increasing brain levels of D-serine or mimicking its action on the NMDA receptor.",

To evaluate the significance of DAAO-mediated metabolism in the pharmacokinetics of oral D-serine, plasma D-serine levels were measured in both wild-type mice and transgenic mice lacking DAAO. Although D-serine levels were rapidly diminished in wild-type mice (t(½) = 1.2 h), sustained drug levels over the course of 4 h (t(½) > 10 h) were observed in mice lacking DAAO. Coadministration of D-serine with 6-chlorobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-ol (CBIO), a small-molecule DAAO inhibitor, in wild-type mice resulted in the enhancement of plasma D-serine levels, although CBIO seems to have only temporary effects on the plasma D-serine levels due to glucuronidation of the key hydroxyl group. These findings highlight the predominant role of DAAO in the clearance of D-serine from the systemic circulation. Thus, a potent DAAO inhibitor with a longer half-life should be capable of maintaining high plasma D-serine levels over a sustained period of time and might have therapeutic implications for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Observations that antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor of glutamatergic neurons can mimic symptoms of schizophrenia have raised the hope that NMDA agonists can improve symptoms. On the basis of encouraging results of trials in which NMDA agonists were added to antipsychotics, we conducted an adequately powered randomized controlled trial adding d-serine, an NMDA modulator, to antipsychotics. METHOD: This study was a 195-patient, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 16-week trial of d-serine 2 g/d as an add-on treatment to antipsychotics. Subjects had DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and were inpatients or outpatients stabilized on antipsychotics, with persistent negative symptoms. The primary outcome measures were changes in negative symptoms and cognition as measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) battery, respectively. The study was performed between 2003 and 2007. RESULTS: Mean total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores at baseline were 75.5. Subjects receiving d-serine and placebo improved in scores on the SANS and MATRICS, but no significant differences were observed between groups: improvement on SANS was 11.4% for d-serine vs 14.8% for placebo, F1,147=1.18, P=.32; and improvement on MATRICS was 6.8% for d-serine vs 6.1% for placebo, F1,125=0.96, P=.39, respectively. d-Serine was well tolerated. DISCUSSION: This study did not find a significant difference between drug and placebo. However, the results are limited by a relatively large placebo response and somewhat lower-achieved doses than in prior studies. Future studies will administer higher doses and will attempt to affect the NMDA receptor using other mechanisms, such as agonists of the presynaptic metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor or glycine reuptake inhibitors.

      "abstract": "Addiction is a disease that is characterized by compulsive drug-seeking and use despite negative health and social consequences. One obstacle in treating addiction is a high susceptibility for relapse which persists despite prolonged periods of abstinence. Relapse can be triggered by drug predictive stimuli such as environmental context and drug associated cues, as well as the addictive drug itself. The conditioned place preference (CPP) behavioral model is a useful paradigm for studying the ability of these drug predictive stimuli to reinstate drug-seeking behavior. The present study investigated the dose-dependent effects of D-serine (10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) on extinction training and drug-primed reinstatement in cocaine-conditioned rats. In the first experiment, D-serine had no effect on the acquisition or development of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization or CPP. In the second experiment, D-serine treatment resulted in significantly decreased time spent in the drug-paired compartment following completion of an extinction protocol. A cocaine-primed reinstatement test indicated that the combination of extinction training along with D-serine treatment resulted in a significant reduction of drug-seeking behavior. The third experiment assessed D-serine's long-term effects to diminish drug-primed reinstatement. D-serine treatment given during extinction was effective in reducing drug-seeking for more than four weeks of abstinence after the last cocaine exposure. These findings demonstrate that D-serine may be an effective adjunct therapeutic agent along with cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of cocaine addiction.

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known to be a risk factor in the development of deficits in cognition, learning, and memory. In DM animal models, including the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rodent model, abnormalities in the regulation of several neurotransmitters have been reported. However, the role in DM of d-serine, an endogenous co-agonist of glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, remains unknown. Here, we measured the amounts of d-/l-serine and l-glutamate in the hippocampi of STZ-treated mice using a 2D-HPLC system from acute to chronic phases after the induction of DM. STZ treatment significantly increased the d-serine level by 23.7% in the hippocampus compared with vehicle treatment at 1 week after the injection, whereas it did not affect the levels of l-serine. In contrast, l-glutamate levels in the hippocampus were elevated at 3 days after STZ injection and rather decreased at 1 week after that. Such alterations in the amino acids were not evident in the chronic phases. We further tested whether the STZ-induced d-serine increase was caused by DM pathophysiology. In vivo, subcutaneous insulin implants into STZ-treated mice restored the elevated d-serine levels in the hippocampus. An in vitro study using primary cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that treatments of STZ did not directly affect the level of d-serine secreted in the cultured media. These results indicate that DM pathology caused by insulin deficiency triggers transient d-serine increase and l-glutamate alteration in the hippocampus. Such aberrant regulations of excitatory neurotransmitters may be relevant to the formation of DM-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS).",

      "abstract": "D-Serine, which is synthesized by the enzyme serine racemase (SR), is a co-agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). In an animal model of NMDAR hypofunction, the constitutive SR knockout (SR-/-) mouse, pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) have reductions in the complexity, total length, and spine density of apical and basal dendrites. We wondered whether the dendritic pathology required deprivation of D-serine throughout development or reflected the loss of D-serine only in adulthood. To address this question, we used mice homozygous for floxed SR in which we bred CaMKIICre2834, which is expressed in forebrain glutamatergic neurons starting at 3-4 weeks post-partum (nSR-/-). Our prior studies demonstrated that the majority of cortical SR is expressed in glutamatergic neurons. We found that similar to SR-/- mice, pyramidal neurons in S1 of nSR-/- also had significantly reduced dendritic arborization and spine density, albeit to a lesser degree. S1 neurons of nSR-/- mice had reduced total basal dendritic length that was accompanied by less complex arborization. These characteristics were unaltered in the apical dendritic compartment. In contrast, spine density on S1 neurons was significantly reduced on apical, but not basal dendrites of nSR-/- mice. These results demonstrate that in adulthood neuronally derived D-serine, which is required for optimal activation of post-synaptic NMDAR activity, regulates pyramidal neuron dendritic arborization and spine density. Moreover, they highlight the glycine modulatory site (GMS) of the NMDAR as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by synaptic deficits, like schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Recent data indicate that age-related N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) transmission impairment is correlated with the reduction in serine racemase (SR) expression and d-serine content. As apoptosis is associated with several diseases and conditions that generally occur with age, we investigated the modulation of SR/d-serine pathway during neuronal apoptosis and its impact on survival. We found that in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), undergoing apoptosis SR/d-serine pathway is crucially regulated. In the early phase of apoptosis, the expression of SR is reduced, both at the protein and RNA level through pathways, upstream of caspase activation, involving ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Forced expression of SR, together with treatment with NMDA and d-serine, blocks neuronal death, whereas pharmacological inhibition and Sh-RNA-mediated suppression of endogenous SR exacerbate neuronal death. In the late phase of apoptosis, the increased expression of SR contribute to the last, NMDAR-mediated, wave of cell death. These findings are relevant to our understanding of neuronal apoptosis and NMDAR activity regulation, raising further questions as to the role of SR/d-serine in those neuro-pathophysiological processes, such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases characterized by a convergence of apoptotic mechanisms and NMDAR dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation is deleterious for organs with reduced capacity of regeneration, such as the brain. Recently, studies have focused on investigating the therapeutic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Excitotoxicity is the pathological process when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), receptors are overactivated. This process may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. D-serine is one of the coagonist of NMDA receptors, and increased levels of D-serine are associated with excitotoxicity. In our study, the potential neuroprotective effects of mefenamic acid, acetaminophen, and naproxen sodium were investigated against D-serine-induced oxidative stress in the rat brain in vitro. To show their potential neuroprotective properties, NSAIDs were incubated with D-serine and reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl content of the brain after different treatments were measured. Our results demostrate that NSAIDs used in the present study significantly reduced ROS production, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation against D-serine treatment.",

In our study, we investigated the effects of mefenamic acid against d-serine on oxidative stress in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of rats. Furthermore, the potential inflammatory and apoptotic effects of d-serine and potential protective effect of mefenamic acid were determined at mRNA and protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, Bcl-2 and Bax. We found that d-serine significantly increased oxidative stress, levels of inflammation- and apoptosis-related molecules in a region specific manner. Mefenamic acid treatment provided significant protection against the elevation of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and Bax. As a conclusion, we suggest that d-serine, as a potential neurodegenerative agent, may have a pivotal role in the regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis; and NSAIDs, such as mefenamic acid, may assist other therapeutics in treating disorders where d-serine-induced neurotoxic mechanisms are involved in.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from an imbalance between antioxidant defenses and the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to age-related memory deficits. While impaired synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks is thought to underlie cognitive deficits during aging, whether this process is targeted by OS and what the mechanisms involved are still remain open questions. In this study, we investigated the age-related effects of the reducing agent N-acetyl-L-cysteine (L-NAC) on the activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) by its co-agonist D-serine, because alterations in this mechanism contribute greatly to synaptic plasticity deficits in aged animals. Long-term dietary supplementation with L-NAC prevented oxidative damage in the hippocampus of aged rats. Electrophysiological recordings in the CA1 of hippocampal slices indicated that NMDA-R-mediated synaptic potentials and theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) were depressed in aged animals, deficits that could be reversed by exogenous D-serine. Chronic treatment with L-NAC, but not acute application of the reducing agent, restored potent D-serine-dependent NMDA-R activation and LTP induction in aged rats. In addition, it is also revealed that the age-related decrease in D-serine levels and in the expression of the synthesizing enzyme serine racemase, which underlies the decrease in NMDA-R activation by the amino acid, was rescued by long-term dietary treatment with L-NAC. Our results indicate that protecting redox status in aged animals could prevent injury to the cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive aging, in part by maintaining potent NMDA-R activation through the D-serine-dependent pathway.",

      "abstract": "D-serine is an endogenous neurotransmitter that binds to the NMDA receptor, thereby increasing the affinity for glutamate, and the potential for excitotoxicity. The primary source of D-serine in vivo is enzymatic racemization by serine racemase (SR). Regulation of D-serine in vivo is poorly understood, but is thought to involve a combination of controlled production, synaptic reuptake by transporters, and intracellular degradation by D-amino acid oxidase (DAO). However, SR itself possesses a well-characterized eliminase activity, which effectively degrades D-serine as well. D-serine is increased two-fold in spinal cords of G93A Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mice--the standard model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS mice with SR disruption show earlier symptom onset, but survive longer (progression phase is slowed), in an SR-dependent manner. Paradoxically, administration of D-serine to ALS mice dramatically lowers cord levels of D-serine, leading to changes in the onset and survival very similar to SR deletion. D-serine treatment also increases cord levels of the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (Asc-1). Although the mechanism by which SOD1 mutations increases D-serine is not known, these results strongly suggest that SR and D-serine are fundamentally involved in both the pre-symptomatic and progression phases of disease, and offer a direct link between mutant SOD1 and a glial-derived toxic mediator.",
