      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Disorders associated with mental health significantly impact disability-adjusted life year values and represent an ongoing problem in stressed societies. Worsening mental health also affects cognitive function and quality of life. Increasing attention has thus been attracted to preventive measures for mental and brain health in daily life. This has created a growing interest in care using laughter. This study assessed the effects of a short-term, laughter-based intervention on the mental health and cognitive functions of middle-aged adults. METHODS: The study applied a single-blind, crossover-controlled trial design. Cognitive tasks (e.g., digit vigilance) were performed after participants viewed a video clip of approximately four minutes (comedic or control video), and the resulting scores were treated as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included cerebral blood flow in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (measured using NIRS), heart rate variability (calculated from ECG), subjective mood assessment, and salivary stress biomarkers (e.g., α-amylase activity). RESULTS: The study was conducted on 25 healthy Japanese-speaking adults aged 40 to 65. Results revealed a significant increase in digit vigilance scores. Compared to viewing the control video, participants evinced a trend toward an increase in serial seven subtraction scores after viewing the comedic video. No significant differences were found for other cognitive tasks. The cerebral blood flow was also significantly higher in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the cognitive tasks performed after the participants viewed the comedic video compared to the control video. The outcomes of heart rate variability, subjective mood state assessment, and salivary stress markers also suggested that the comedic video intervention could subsequently contribute to the activation of parasympathetic activity and reduce psychological stress levels. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes indicated that interventions using short comedic videos can improve focus and may reduce psychological stress. These results support the clinical benefits of humor, which can be utilized as a simple, non-invasive approach to promoting the health of middle-aged adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Kirin Holdings Company (No. 2020-014) and registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) database (Registration No. UMIN000043332; http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ ) on February 15, 2021.",

      "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by people with a characteristic happy demeanor, impaired expressive communication, sleep disruptions, and a variety of paroxysmal events, including seizures and movement disorders. Herein, we report three cases, one child and two adults with AS, of gelastic (laugh-related) spells. The phenomenology in all three is most consistent with gelastic syncope. A fourth example demonstrating transient breath-holding while laughing is included for reference. We subsequently review the differential for gelastic spells in AS, including seizures and cataplexy, and expound on the importance of their identification in the context of risk factors for cardiac arrhythmia. This work adds gelastic syncope to the list of paroxysmal events in AS and may serve to inform providers and parents of this phenotype and provide guidance for subsequent evaluation and treatment if indicated."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide and laughter therapy is used as a complementary therapy for cancer treatment. This study aimed to investigate the effects of laughter therapy on psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety, and depression) and physical symptoms (pain, fatigue, and sleep quality) among cancer patients. METHODS: Eight databases were searched, with the search period was limited to April 2024. Quality assessment of the included randomized controlled trials was performed according to the criteria for evaluating randomized controlled trials in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The RevMan 5.4 software was used for the data analysis. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The quality of the included studies was relatively high. The results showed that laughter therapy can effectively improve cancer patients' stress, anxiety, depression, pain, and fatigue, but has no effect on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter therapy is a low-cost, easy-to-implement intervention that may have potential benefits in improving psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety, and depression) and physical symptoms (pain and fatigue) among cancer patients. Laughter therapy has the characteristics of high safety, strong interaction, and strong feasibility. It may promote communication between patients and between patients and medical healthcare, enhance the trust relationship between medical staff, and potentially improve the quality of life for cancer patients. Healthcare professionals should consider laughter therapy as a potential adjunctive therapy, but its implementation should be tailored to individual patient needs and supported by robust evidence.",

OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled study was conducted to determine the effect of laughter yoga practiced by first year nursing students before clinical practice on their perceptions of stress and meaning of life. METHOD: In this experimental randomized and controlled study including a control group, we administered a pre-test, post-test one and post-test two to the participating students. Ninety nursing students who met the inclusion criteria comprised the study sample. The students in the intervention group took part in eight sessions of laughter yoga for four weeks, twice a week. The Descriptive Information Form, Perceived Stress Scale, and Meaning and Purpose of Life Scale were administered to collect the study data. RESULTS: The mean age of the students in the intervention and control groups was 19.65 ± 2.27 and 19.18 ± 1.01 years, respectively. Of the participants in both groups, 91.1% were women, and 97.8% were single. The difference between the mean scores obtained from the Perceived Stress Scale and the Meaning and Purpose of Life Scale by the students in the intervention group at the pre- and posttest were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Laughter yoga positively affects nursing students' perceptions of stress and meaning and purpose of life.

This study was a pretest, posttest, parallel-group, randomized control trial to evaluate the effect of laughter yoga on hope and school burnout in eighth-grade students. The population of the study consisted of 60 eighth-grade middle school students (intervention group n=30 and control group n=30). Laughter yoga was practiced face-to-face with the intervention group twice a week for 35-40 minutes and in six sessions in total. The protocol of the study was registered with the number NCT05742308 (ClinicalTrials.gov). After laughter yoga, there was a statistically significant difference between the intervention (17.27 ± 8.76) and control (22.90 ± 7.08) groups in the mean scores of the school burnout scale (p < .05) and a statistically significant difference between the intervention (29.28 ± 5.66) and control (22.28 ± 5.65) groups in the mean scores of the children's hope scale (p < .05). School health nursing practices have an important role in the process of acquiring positive health behaviors in school-age children. They are able to use evidence-based practices to reduce student burnout and improve hope. Based on the results of the study, school health nurses can use laughter yoga to increase hope levels and decrease burnout levels in eighth-grade students."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cancer patients generally have high stress levels, which often leads to depression, anxiety and other psychological problems. Laughter therapy has been used to relieve stress, depression and anxiety in cancer patients, but its efficacy is uncertain. The study aims to summarize evidence on the efficacy of laughter therapy on psychological symptoms of people with cancer. METHODS: A search was conducted in 10 electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported before May 2023. This systematic review was reported based on the PRISMA 2020 statement. The evaluation of methodological quality and risk of biases were conducted by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool version 2, and evidence evaluation was conducted using the GRADE pro online assessment tool. Statistical analysis adopted the Review Manager version 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included involving 543 participants. Meta-analysis showed that laughter therapy plus routine nursing produced more positive effects than routine nursing in relieving stress (SMD = -1.18, 95% CI -1.73, -0.62, p < 0.0001), depression (SMD = -1.05, 95% CI -1.30, -0.81, p < 0.00001) and anxiety (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI -1.20, -0.43, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Laughter therapy could effectively relieve stress, depression and anxiety of cancer patients. Future studies should improve the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials, conduct appropriate follow-up, and report details of follow-up. Additionally, it should perform multi-center and large-sample studies, and combine both subjective and objective outcome indications to enhance the persuasiveness of evidence supporting the effectiveness of laughter therapy.

Nonetheless, there is a dearth of research investigating the impact of laughter yoga (LY) on nursing students' well-being, perceived stress, and self-efficacy. The aim of this single-blinded, two-armed randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of LY on nursing students' well-being, perceived stress, and academic self-efficacy (ASE). A total of five sessions of LY were applied to the intervention group. The analysis included a total of 83 nursing students (intervention group n = 41 and control group n = 42). Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and paired-samples t-test were used for data analysis. Results revealed that the intervention group showed a significant increase in well-being (p < .001) and a decrease in perceived stress after LY (p < .01). However, statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups were not found in well-being, perceived stress, and ASE (p > .05). These results indicate the potential effects of LY on the students' well-being and perceived stress. Community mental health nurses and educators can use LY to improve well-being in universities.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of laughter therapy on perceived stress levels and quality of life in women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy using a parallel-group randomized controlled pilot trial. METHODS: Forty-two women were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received 40 minutes of laughter therapy twice a week for 8 weeks. The control group received routine treatment. The women in both groups completed the Perceived Stress Scale and SF-12 Health Survey at baseline, week 5, and week 9 after randomization. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the mean Perceived Stress Scale scores in the intervention group compared with those in the control group at weeks 5 and 9 compared with baseline, and the difference between groups by measurement week was significant (P < .001). Women in the intervention group had higher Physical Component Summary-12 and Mental Component Summary-12 scores in weeks 5 and 9 compared with those in the control group, and there was a significant difference between groups in terms of change in the Physical Component Summary-12 and Mental Component Summary-12 mean scores over time (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Laughter therapy is possible to use as a nursing intervention to reduce the perceived stress levels and increase the quality of life of women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses can apply laughter therapy in the symptom management of women receiving chemotherapy."

AIMS: This study aimed to determine the effect of laughter therapy on self-efficacy and psychological well-being in nursing students. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, 208 nursing students were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 102) and a control (n = 106) group. The experimental group received laughter therapy face-to-face once a week for eight weeks. No intervention was applied to the control group. In both groups, data were collected at the beginning of the study and the end of the eighth week using a Sociodemographic Questionnaire Form, the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Psychological Well-Being Scale. RESULTS: In the post-study group comparisons, there was a statistically significant difference in the scores for the total Academic Self-Efficacy Scale, the external emotion management and collegiality subscales, and the total Psychological Well-Being Scale (p > 0.05). With regard to all the scale scores, no statistically significant difference was found in the groups in the pre- and post-comparisons (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that laughter therapy increased the mean psychological well-being score in the experimental group. It was also found that after the laughter therapy, distraction and loss of interest in lectures decreased, stress and anxiety levels decreased, eating and sleeping habits were regulated, and social media use decreased.

SETTING: Recruitment was from clinics and community and the trial took place at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, the largest ophthalmic centre in China, between 18 June 2020 to 8 January 2021. PARTICIPANTS: People with symptomatic dry eye disease aged 18-45 years with ocular surface disease index scores ranging from 18 to 80 and tear film break-up time of eight seconds or less. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive laughter exercise or artificial tears (0.1% sodium hyaluronic acid eyedrop, control group) four times daily for eight weeks. The laughter exercise group viewed an instructional video and participants were requested to vocalise the phrases \"Hee hee hee, hah hah hah, cheese cheese cheese, cheek cheek cheek, hah hah hah hah hah hah\" 30 times per five minute session. Investigators assessing study outcomes were masked to group assignment but participants were unmasked for practical reasons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean change in the ocular surface disease index (0-100, higher scores indicating worse ocular surface discomfort) from baseline to eight weeks in the per protocol population. The non-inferiority margin was 6 points of this index score. Main secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with a decrease from baseline in ocular surface disease index score of at least 10 points and changes in dry eye disease signs, for example, non-invasive tear break up time at eight weeks. RESULTS: 299 participants (mean age 28.9 years; 74% female) were randomly assigned to receive laughter exercise (n=149) or 0.1% sodium hyaluronic acid (n=150). 283 (95%) completed the trial. The mean change in ocular surface disease index score at eight weeks was -10.5 points (95% confidence interval (CI) -13.1 to -7.82) in the laughter exercise group and -8.83 (-11.7 to -6.02) in the control group. The upper boundary of the CI for difference in change between groups was lower than the non-inferiority margin (mean difference -1.45 points (95% CI -5.08 to 2.19); P=0.43), supporting non-inferiority. Among secondary outcomes, the laughter exercise was better in improving non-invasive tear break up time (mean difference 2.30 seconds (95% CI 1.30 to 3.30), P<0.001); other secondary outcomes showed no significant difference. No adverse events were noted in either study group. CONCLUSIONS: The laughter exercise was non-inferior to 0.1% sodium hyaluronic acid in relieving subjective symptoms in patients with dry eye disease with limited corneal staining over eight weeks intervention.

RESULTS: In the study, it was found that there was a decrease in the MRS total score after the intervention in women in all three intervention groups compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). In the laughter yoga group, total MRS scores decreased by 3.16 points ( P < 0.05). In the acupressure group, total MRS scores decreased by 5.46 points ( P < 0.05). In the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program group, total MRS scores decreased by 4.65 points ( P < 0.05). It was determined that the mean scores of women in the laughter yoga and acupressure groups on all subscales of the MENQOL decreased after the intervention compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). The comparison of the MBSR group and the control group showed that there was a decrease only in the psychosocial domain subdimension of the MENQOL ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it was determined that laughter yoga, acupressure, and MBSR could be effective in reducing menopause symptoms and improving quality of life, although findings require further testing in a rigorously controlled study and in a study with only a single prespecified outcome.",

About 36 women who attend the Menopause School were randomized into either the laughter yoga (n = 18) or the control group (n = 18). The laughter yoga group participated in eight online laughter yoga sessions, with two sessions per week for four weeks, whereas the control group did not receive any intervention. Data were collected using the Descriptive Characteristics Form, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The laughter yoga group had significantly lower posttest VAS scores compared with the control group in all VMS ( P < .05). Furthermore, the posttest PSQI score of the laughter yoga group was significantly lower than that of the control group ( P < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the pretest and posttest scores obtained by the control group from the VAS and PSQI ( P > .05), the intervention group exhibited a statistically significant difference in their pretest and posttest VAS and PSQI scores ( P < .05; P < .001, respectively). The results indicate that laughter yoga is an effective method for reducing VMS and improving sleep quality."

DESIGN: This study was a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The study was conducted with nurses working at the university hospital's surgical intensive care and anesthesia intensive care units of the third-level intensive care unit in Turkey. Data obtained from 30 participants in the intervention group and 33 participants in the control group were analyzed. The Nurse Introduction Form, Nurse Job Motivation Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale were used to collect data.

METHOD: In this 3-arm randomized clinical trial, 91 depressed aged participants aged 60-75 years, referred to Rafsanjan health centers, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The study followed a parallel group design with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The laughter yoga intervention was conducted twice a week for eight weeks, and music intervention consisted of 30-min sessions twice a week for eight weeks. The control group received no intervention ('No treatment' concurrent control). Assessments for depressive symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety, and stress were conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and one month after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were analyzed in three groups included the laughter yoga intervention (n = 31), music intervention (n = 25), or control group (n = 28). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant decrease in depressive and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001) from pre-test to post-test and one-month follow-ups. The greatest impact of the intervention programs on stress was observed immediately after the intervention, but stress increased one month after the intervention programs (p = 0.125). CONCLUSION: Both laughter yoga and music interventions proved effective in improving depression, anxiety, and stress in aged individuals. However, laughter yoga intervention demonstrated a superior effect and better acceptance among elders.",

Even if they received hemodialysis (HD) treatment regularly, patients would experience many complications such as cardiovascular disease, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and a declining quality of life. Laughter Yoga has been reported to have many positive effects on patients with chronic illnesses. By removing or reducing stress, Laughter Yoga (LY) helps to improve patients' quality of life, Thus, they have a longer chance of survival. However, the effect of Laughter Yoga on HD patients is generally inconclusive. Objective is to evaluate LY's impact on HD patients. We searched electronic databases that included Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and clinical trial registries. The search period was from their inception to January 29, 2023. The search keywords included laughter therapy, laughter yoga, laugh, hemodialysis, dialysis, and renal dialysis. The systematic review included both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experiments studies. Three RCTs and three non-RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Laughter Yoga showed patients having improvement in several outcomes such as life quality, pain severity, sleep quality, subjective well-being, mood, depression, blood pressure, and vital capacity. A well-designed RCT will be developed to further test the potential benefits of LY for HD patients.",

Our analysis indicates that laughter yoga can significantly improve the quality of life of cancer patients by improving emotional and physical functioning and reducing symptoms of depression and stress. These findings suggest that laughter yoga is a promising CAM practice for enhancing cancer patients' psychological and physical health. Future research should aim to extend these studies to more extensive and more diverse populations to validate and expand upon these findings."

Laughter yoga involves a combination of laughter exercises and breathing techniques derived from more traditional yoga practice. No previous studies have examined the effects of laughter yoga on the symptoms of PMS. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to assess the effectiveness of laughter yoga in coping with the premenstrual symptoms of women. DESIGN: The research team performed a pretest and posttest, quasi-experimental study. SETTING: The study took place in the nursing and midwifery departments at Marmara University, a state university located in Istanbul, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 80 female students in those departments at the university between February 2019 and May 2020 who had PMS. INTERVENTION: The research team divided participants into two groups based on their departments: (1) an intervention group, the laughter yoga group, with 32 participants who took part in a twice-weekly laughter yoga program that included a weekly 30-min group session consisting of laughter and deep breathing, and (2) a control group with 48 participants. OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team collected the data using the Demographic and Descriptive Information Form (DDIF), Premenstrual Syndrome Symptom Scale (PMSS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). RESULTS: Between baseline and postintervention, the laughter yoga group's mean scores for the PMSS subdimensions depressive affection (P = .00), anxiety (P = .04), fatigue (P = .00), irritability (P = .01), depressive thoughts (P = .03), pain (P = .002), changes in sleep (P = .004), and bloating (P = .001) significantly decreased. The laughter yoga group's scores for fatigue (P = .03) and pain (P = .001) were significantly lower than those of the control group postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter yoga is a noninvasive complementary therapy that clinicians can use to reduce the PMS symptoms.",

      "abstract": "OBJETIVE: Chemotherapy is a prevalent cancer treatment, often accompanied by debilitating side effects such as nausea and vomiting. This study explores the potential effectiveness of laughter yoga, a combination of exercise and voluntary laughter, in alleviating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. METHODS: This two-group randomized clinical trial was conducted on 69 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Reza Chemotherapy and Oncology Center, Mashhad, Iran, in 2018. Patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Both groups received routine self-care training, with the addition of four 20-min to 30-min laughter yoga sessions held immediately before one of their chemotherapy appointments for the intervention group only. Nausea and vomiting were assessed using the Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis questionnaire at two stages, before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed with Chi-square, Independent-t, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, and McNemar tests using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: The mean age of patients in the intervention group was 49.0 ± 9.6 years, while in the control group, it was 45.2 ± 12.6 years. The intragroup comparison showed a statistically significant decrease in the severity and duration of nausea in the intervention group and a statistically significant increase in the severity and duration of nausea in the control group from pre-test to post-test (P < 0.05). The intergroup comparison showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of vomiting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter yoga demonstrates promise in improving chemotherapy-induced nausea, suggesting its potential recommendation for managing this distressing side effect. Further research is warranted to explore its broader application in cancer care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study (No. IRCT20180429039463N1) was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials on 21/08/2018."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality rate in China. Although chemotherapy is effective in improving clinical symptoms, it causes a variety of acute and chronic side effects, seriously aggravating the psychological stress of patients. Laughter Yoga as a new type of aerobic exercise can effectively reduce stress levels and increase positive mood in patients. This study aimed to examine the effects of laughter yoga on perceived stress, positive psychological capital, and exercise capacity in lung cancer patients. METHODS: This study was a randomized, single-blind, parallel-group trial. The study enrolled 84 lung cancer chemotherapy patients from a general hospital in central China. These patients were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups (n = 42 per group) after baseline assessments. Patients in the control group received routine care and those in the intervention group received laughter yoga intervention. Perceived stress, positive psychological capital, and exercise capacity were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention. RESULTS: During the implementation of the study, there were 2 dropouts in each of the intervention and control groups. Ultimately, 80 patients in the control and intervention groups completed the trial. Patients who received laughter yoga intervention had significantly higher scores in positive psychological capital (P < .01, Cohen's d = 0.692) and exercise capacity (P < .01, Cohen's d = 0.659). Discernible differences were also observed in perceived stress (P < .01, Cohen's d = 1.087) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that laughter yoga is an effective way and may produce beneficial effects on perceived stress, positive psychological capital and exercise capacity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With aging and growth of the population, the risk of cancer incidence and mortality is rapidly increasing. However, psychosocial treatment has been seriously neglected in many healthcare settings. Laughter therapy is a therapeutic program to improve emotional wellbeing and health which has been applied as a complementary treatment. We aim to explore effects of laughter therapy for patients with cancer on their negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, stress, pain, and fatigue. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, WANFANG data, Weipu (VIP), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and independently rated the risk of bias in every article using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Review Manager and STATA software were used to pool the individually included studies. RESULTS: Seven studies were found eligible to be included in the present review. Overall, study quality was relatively high. Our findings suggest that laughter therapy might have a positive effect on improving emotional response in cancer patients. Arguably, laughter therapy, whether humor or laughter, has a positive effect on anxiety, stress, pain feeling, fatigue, and depression in cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter therapy is a convenient, multi-modality, flexible-duration therapy to improve negative emotions in cancer patients, regardless of their gender, age, and type of cancer.",

This study is a mixed-methods pilot study conducted using a quasi-experimental design based on the pretest-posttest model. Of the participants 68% (n = 17) were male, 92% (n = 23) were single, 56% (14) were high school graduates, 60% (n = 15) were unemployed, 60% (n = 15) lived with their parents, 88% (22) had been receiving treatment for schizophrenia for more than 10 years. The difference between the pretest and post-test means was not found to be significant in participants' perceived stress (p > 0.05), and the difference between the pretest and post-test means of the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale's Interpersonal Relations, Instrumental Role, and Intrapsychicv (mental findings) subscales was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). The main themes of laughter therapy among persons with schizophrenia in the focus group interviews were found to be optimism, coping, health, sociability, motivation, awareness, and functionality. Laughter therapy was found to increase the quality of life of persons with schizophrenia, not affect perceived stress, and positively affect optimism, coping, health, sociability, motivation, awareness, and functionality levels. The researchers recommend using laughter therapy to improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia during their rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is evidence for the impact of comedy and humour for mental health and wellbeing. Existing systematic reviews have concluded laughter has a positive impact on wellbeing, however other potential benefits of comedy interventions have remained under explored. The aim of the current study was to synthesise current evidence for comedy/humour interventions and evaluate mechanisms through which comedy interventions may impact upon the recovery of those experiencing psychological distress, using the Connectedness, Hope, Identity, Meaning and Purpose and Empowerment (CHIME) framework. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched for studies exploring the impact of interventions using comedy on wellbeing and mental health recovery, from earliest record until January 2023. Grey literature was obtained via contacting experts in comedy interventions for mental health and supplemented by an internet search for comedy interventions. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to include primary data, published in English or German, and explore a population of adults, with self-reported distress or a self-reported/diagnosed mental health condition. Studies included only explored interventions which utilised comedy as the main intervention and aimed to induce 'simulated' laughter, in response to a stimulus. 17 studies were included in the review. RESULTS: Studies were found to have positive impact on mental health symptoms and several mechanisms of the CHIME framework for recovery, including connectedness, hope, identity and empowerment. Potential theorised mechanisms for change included confidence in new skills, promotion of social skills, opportunities for social interaction, laughter, vulnerability, and cognitive flexibility. The current review found that comedy/humour interventions are beneficial for mental health recovery and wellbeing and found preliminary evidence for a range of mechanisms through which comedy may have positive impact. DISCUSSION: Further research should focus on qualitative exploration of the mechanisms by which comedy interventions may have impact on wellbeing and mental health recovery for specific populations and within different settings. It is concluded that there is a need for transdisciplinary collaboration in research on comedy interventions, which brings together the expertise of comedians delivering/developing interventions, those with lived experience of mental health issues and researchers from both health sciences and humanities disciplines."

DESIGN: This was randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 55 individuals with an ostomy who received care at Ankara University's I˙bni Sina Hospital Stoma Therapy Unit in Ankara, Turkey. Data were collected over a 2-month period (January and February 2020). METHODS: Participants were allocated into an intervention group (n = 27) who received a yoga therapy intervention and a control group (n = 28) who received no intervention via simple randomization. Demographic and pertinent clinical variables were obtained during a baseline visit in both groups, along with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Stoma-Quality of Life (Stoma-QOL) instruments. The intervention group received laughter yoga weekly over a period of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Mean scores on the PSQI and the Stoma-QOL at baseline were compared. Participants in the intervention had a significant decline in mean PSQI scores (6.85 vs 5.48, P = .044) indicating improvement in sleep quality following the intervention. Analysis revealed no significant difference in mean Stoma-QOL scores (P = .077). Control group participants had no significant difference in either mean PSQI or Stoma-QOL scores following data collection at the end of 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter yoga had a positive effect on the sleep quality in individuals with fecal ostomies. Further research is recommended to evaluate the effect of the number of laughter yoga sessions on the sleep quality and quality of life in individuals with ostomies.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to substantial lifestyle changes worldwide, contributing to heightened psychological stressors such as depression and anxiety. The demands of parental care have also intensified, increasing the risk of caregiver burnout and potential child maltreatment. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of implementing distance laughter therapy for mothers caring for young children during the pandemic, with a focus on mitigating depression, anxiety, and parental stress. Utilizing a pilot randomized controlled design, 22 participants were divided into two groups-experimental and control groups-and underwent four virtual sessions over two weeks. The experimental group engaged in distance laughter therapy, a technique designed to stimulate self-induced laughter, while the control group viewed a 50-minute entertainment TV show. Both groups experienced a significant decrease in depression and anxiety; however, only the experimental group experienced a significant reduction in parental stress. Nonetheless, the differences in outcomes between the groups were not statistically significant. Participants who engaged in distance laughter therapy reported positive changes across physical, emotional, social, self-perception, and stress-coping domains in exit interviews. Therefore, laughter therapy has an additional benefit of reducing parental stress, which may be particularly useful for mothers primarily responsible for childcare during the pandemic. Future research should investigate the effects of laughter on broader populations and settings and quantify the actual amount of laughter generated.",

The 8-year-old ambidextrous patient presented with seizures starting four days prior to presentation, happening multiple times daily and with each seizure lasting for 5-15 s. The patient's neurological examination was normal between episodes, and VEEG recorded ictal laughing events originating focally from the anterior temporal and/or inferior frontal region. Seizures were stopped with Levetiracetam, however given MRI findings surgical intervention was additionally deemed necessary. MRI head with contrast showed 8 mm nodular enhancing lesion located in the anteroventral portion of the right temporal pole with surrounding edema that extended to the anterior margin of the fusiform gyrus. The patient recovered well from surgery with no neurological deficits, is no longer on any antiseizure medications and remains seizure free at 3-year follow-up."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is associated with a wide range of physical and psychological side effects, so complementary and alternative therapies may be practiced as an independent treatment or combined with the standard ones to improve health-related quality of life of cancer patients. Laughter yoga has predominantly been used as a complementary therapy to enhance health and wellbeing of ordinary people and patients with chronic diseases. However, to date, few studies have evaluated the effects of this modern exercise on cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in clinical settings, to the best of the authors' knowledge. the present study aimed to investigate the effects of Laughter Yoga on the health-related quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: This study was a two-group randomized clinical trial on 69 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at Reza Radiotherapy and Oncology Center, Iran in 2018. Patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received laughter yoga for four sessions at one-week intervals. Each session consists of one part and lasts for 20-30 min. Patients' health-related quality of life was assessed before and after the laughter yoga sessions using Quality of Life Questionnaire European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0. SPSS Statistics (v.20 software was used to conduct Chi-square, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon and paired t-tests analyses of the data. RESULTS: The number of participants in intervention and control groups were 34 and 35, there was no significant difference of demographic and disease related characteristics and pre-intervention HRQOL between two groups. In the intervention group, there is significant difference between pre- and post-intervention scores (Mean ± Standard Deviation) of emotional functioning (12.99 ± 10.49), physical functioning (0.78 ± 6.08), role functioning (3.43 ± 7.97), fatigue (-8.82 ± 22.01), pain (-8.33 ± 11.78), sleep disturbance (-15.68 ± 18.77), and global health and quality of life (6.37 ± 5.04) (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the control group. Participants reported no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A structured laughter yoga intervention in a hospital setting effectively improved health-related quality of life for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Benefits to many patients could be expected if this would become a part of routine care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (no. IRCT20180429039463N1) on 21/08/2018.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Laughter as an expression of humor has been recognized as good medicine for centuries. The health benefits of humor-induced well-being remain unclear and thus we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventional studies to evaluate the impact of spontaneous laughter on stress response as measured by cortisol levels. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Clinicaltrials.gov. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Interventional studies, which could be either randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies, conducted in adults that compared any spontaneous laughter intervention to a controlled setting and reported changes in cortisol levels were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We examined the impact of laughter on percentage change in cortisol levels by calculating pooled estimates of the absolute differences between arithmetic means before and after interventions as compared to control using random-effects model. RESULTS: Eight studies (315 participants; mean age 38.6) met our inclusion criteria; four were RCTs and four were quasi-experiment studies. Five studies evaluated the impact of watching a humor/comedy video, two studies evaluating laughter sessions administered by a trained laughter therapist, and one study evaluating a self-administered laughter program. Pooling these data showed a significant reduction in cortisol levels by 31.9% (95%CI -47.7% to -16.3%) induced by laughter intervention compared to control group with no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.66). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that even a single laughter session induced a significant reduction of 36.7% in cortisol (95%CI -52.5% to -20.8%). In addition, analyses including the four RCTs reinforced these results by demonstrating a significant reduction in cortisol levels promoted by laughter as compared to the placebo arm [-37.2% (95%CI -56.3% to -18.1%)]. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence demonstrates that spontaneous laughter is associated with greater reduction in cortisol levels as compared with usual activities, suggesting laughter as a potential adjunctive medical therapy to improve well-being.

      "abstract": "AIM: This study aimed to examine the effect of laughter yoga applied before simulation training on state anxiety, perceived stress levels, self-confidence and satisfaction in undergraduate nursing students. BACKGROUND: Clinical simulation-based teaching implied a revolution in nursing education. Along with the many opportunities that simulation offers, some disadvantages, such as anxiety and stress experienced during simulation scenarios, could affect students' satisfaction and self-confidence in learning. Therefore, laughter yoga could be an alternative method that reduces students' anxiety and stress levels and increases their self-confidence and satisfaction with simulation training. DESIGN: The study was designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. SETTING: This study was conducted at a university in Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 88 undergraduate nursing students were randomized to the intervention group (n = 44) or control group (n = 44). METHODS: The intervention group participated in the laughter yoga sessions just before the clinical simulation scenario, while the control group only performed the simulation training. The researchers examined the effect of laughter yoga on state anxiety, perceived stress levels, self-confidence and satisfaction in learning before and after the intervention. Data were collected between January - February 2022. RESULTS: This study showed that the mean scores of state anxiety, perceived stress, mean pulse rate and arterial pressure of the intervention group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, there was also a significant group*time interaction between the groups on state anxiety, perceived stress, pulse, respiratory and mean arterial pressure scores (p < 0.05). Moreover, the mean scores of student satisfaction and self-confidence in the learning of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings showed that laughter yoga helped nursing students reduce their state anxiety and perceived stress levels related to simulation training and improved their self-confidence and satisfaction with learning. Additionally, it enhanced the students' vital signs (including mean pulse rate and mean arterial pressure). These positive results are promising for using LY as an easy, safe and effective method to reduce undergraduate nursing students' stress and anxiety levels and to improve their learning satisfaction and self-confidence levels in clinical skills training such as simulation training.",

This study aimed to investigate whether laughter yoga can improve glycemic control among individuals with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In a single-center, randomized controlled trial, 42 participants with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group. The intervention consisted of a 12-week laughter yoga program. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, waist circumference, psychological factors, and sleep duration were evaluated at baseline and week 12. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that participants in the laughter yoga group experienced significant improvements in HbA1c levels (between-group difference: -0.31%; 95% CI -0.54, -0.09) and positive affect scores (between-group difference: 0.62 points; 95% CI 0.003, 1.23). Sleep duration tended to increase in the laughter yoga group with a between-group difference of 0.4 hours (95% CI -0.05, 0.86; P = 0.080). The mean attendance rate for laughter yoga program was high (92.9%). CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week laughter yoga program is feasible for individuals with type 2 diabetes and improves glycemic control. These findings suggest that having fun could be a self-care intervention. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are warranted to better evaluate the effects of laughter yoga.

The sample of this intervention study, made using a control group with a pretest/posttest design, consists of 65 older adults living in Turkey. The data were collected in September 2022 using the Personal Information Form, the Loneliness Scale for the Elderly, the Brief Psychological Resilience Scale, and the Quality of Life Scale for the Elderly. The intervention group (n=32) took part in laughter yoga twice a week for four weeks. No intervention was made with the control group (n=33). A statistically significant difference was found between the groups' mean post-test scores for loneliness, psychological resilience, and quality of life (p < 0.05) after the laughter yoga sessions. The eight-session laughter yoga program was found to reduce loneliness and increase resilience and quality of life in older adults.",

AIMS: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of online laughter therapy sessions on depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness levels in first-year nursing students. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 61 healthy nursing students were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 32) and control groups (n = 29). The intervention group received online laughter therapy twice weekly for four weeks. The control group received no intervention. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale at the study initiation and week four in both groups. RESULTS: There was no difference between the mean scores of the groups in the pre-test (p > 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between groups in terms of depression after online laughter therapy sessions (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between anxiety, stress, and loneliness levels (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Online laughter therapy sessions significantly reduced depression but had no effect on anxiety, stress, and loneliness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, online laughter therapy can be organized to reduce depression levels.",

However, the use of humor or laughter in palliative care settings is still limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of laughter therapy involving spontaneous laughter on mood disturbances and pain in terminally ill patients with cancer and mood disturbances and the levels of burnout in family caregivers. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study used a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design. The laughter therapy developed was provided for 20 to 30 minutes a day for 5 consecutive days. Twenty-six pairs of terminally ill cancer patients and family caregivers in the intervention group and 23 pairs in the comparison group from the hospice ward of a tertiary teaching hospital participated in this study. The data were collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive statistics and 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: There were significant decreases in mood disturbances in the patients ( P < .001) and family caregivers ( P < .001), pain in the patients ( P < .001), and levels of burnout in the caregivers ( P < .001) in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Laughter therapy can be an alternative intervention to support both terminally ill patients with cancer and their family caregivers experiencing multidimensional distress in palliative care settings. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The appropriate use of laughter or humor therapy needs to be encouraged as a support tool in palliative care. Palliative care teams must be properly trained to provide spontaneous laughter therapy or planned humor therapy.",

The eight-week laughter therapy, held twice a week in a 60-min group session, included laughter, entertainment, music-related chorusing, breathing exercises, and meditation. The values of physical symptoms, pulmonary function, depression, and HRQOL from before and after the therapy were analyzed using the paired t-test and the Mann−Whitney U-test. To verify group differences between the experiment and control group, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were employed. Unlike the control group, laughter therapy decreased physical symptoms (t = 7.30, p < 0.01) and increased pulmonary function (t = −3.77, p < 0.01). Psychological health also improved, including depression (t = 10.46, p < 0.01) and HRQOL (t = −9.31, p < 0.01) in the experimental group but not in the control group.

Many underlying conditions-including neurodegenerative diseases, CNS inflammation, vascular lesions and traumatic brain injury-can be associated with disinhibition of emotional reflex control. This suggests a disruption of anatomical and functional networks, rather than any specific unifying pathological process. There is a wide differential diagnosis, including depression, dementia and other forms of behavioural disturbance. Diagnostic criteria and rating scales can help with clinical assessments and facilitate clinical trials. There is now good-quality evidence for a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine, with weaker evidence for tricyclic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Pathological laughter and crying is disabling and underdiagnosed but potentially treatable, and its wider recognition is important.",

Methodological studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of laughter therapy, which is effective in reducing anxiety and stress, on the online platform. The current study protocol was designed to evaluate the effect of online laughter therapy on anxiety, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being. METHODS: Forty students were selected for the intervention group and forty students for the control group by assigning 1:1 with a real random number selector among 140 senior nursing students who made up the universe. The intervention group received ten sessions of online laughter therapy two days a week for five weeks. Participants in the control group did not receive any intervention during the study. Data were obtained at the beginning of the study and after five weeks with the 'State-Trait Anxiety Inventory', 'Satisfaction with Life Scale' and 'Psychological Well-Being Scale'. RESULTS: After laughter therapy, the intervention result showed a significant increase in life satisfaction and psychological well-being scores (p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in anxiety scores (p < 0.001) in the intervention group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The study reveals that online laughter therapy significantly positively affects nursing students' anxiety, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The practicality of the idea whether the laughter-involved large-scale brain networks can be stimulated to remediate affective symptoms, namely depression, has remained elusive. METHODS: In this study, 25 healthy individuals were tested through 21-channel quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) setup upon resting state and while submitted to standardized funny video clips (corated by two behavioral neuroscientists and a verified expert comedian, into neutral and mildly to highly funny). We evaluated the individuals' facial expressions against the valence and intensity of each stimulus through the Nuldos face analysis software. The study also employed an eye-tracking setup to examine fixations, gaze, and saccadic movements upon each task. In addition, changes in polygraphic parameters were monitored upon resting state and exposure to clips using the 4-channel Nexus polygraphy setup. RESULTS: The happy facial expression analysis, as a function of rated funny clips, showed a significant difference against neutral videos (p < 0.001). In terms of the polygraphic changes, heart rate variability and the trapezius muscle surface electromyography measures were significantly higher upon exposure to funny vs. neutral videos (p < 0.5). The average pupil size and fixation drifts were significantly higher and lower, respectively, upon exposure to funny videos (p < 0.01). The qEEG data revealed the highest current source density (CSD) for the alpha frequency band localized in the left frontotemporal network (FTN) upon exposure to funny clips. Additionally, left FTN acquired the highest value for theta coherence z-score, while the beta CSD predominantly fell upon the salience network (SN). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data support the notion that left FTN may be targeted as a cortical hub for noninvasive neuromodulation as a single or adjunct therapy in remediating affective disorders in the clinical setting. Further studies are needed to test the hypotheses derived from the present report.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While there have been several intervention studies on the psychological effects of laughter, few have examined both the psychological and physical effects. This study investigates the effects of a laughter program on body weight, body mass index (BMI), subjective stress, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among Japanese community-dwelling individuals using a randomized controlled trial with a waitlist. METHODS: Overall, 235 participants (37 men and 198 women) aged 43-79 years (mean 66.9, median 67.0) were randomized into laughter intervention and control groups (n = 117 and n = 118, respectively) to participate in a 12-week laughter program. Body weight, subjective stress, subjective well-being, and HRQOL were measured at the baseline, with a 12-week follow-up. The laughter program intervention's effects on these factors were analyzed using an analysis of covariance adjusted by age, sex, risk factors, medication, and area. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation and a general linear model analyzed the relationship between participants' BMI and psychological index changes. RESULTS: The comprehensive laughter program significantly improved the mean body weight (p = 0.008), BMI (p = 0.006), subjective stress (p = 0.004), subjective well-being (p = 0.002), optimism (p = 0.03), and physical component summary (PCS) scores of HRQOL (p = 0.04). A similar tendency occurred for the mean changes in BMI and subjective stress score by area, sex, and age. Moreover, there was a significant and negative correlation between the change in BMI and PCS change (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The comprehensive 12-week laughter intervention program, mainly comprising laughter yoga, significantly improved physical and psychological functions such as body weight, BMI, subjective stress, subjective well-being, and HRQOL among predominantly elderly Japanese community-dwelling individuals with metabolic syndrome risk factors. Moreover, PCS improved among participants who reduced BMI after the intervention. These results suggest that the laughter program may help reduce body weight in participants with metabolic syndrome risk factors by reducing stress and improving HRQOL and mental health factors, such as subjective well-being and optimism.

DESIGN: Interpretive qualitative study. METHODS: Focus groups with clinical nursing staff from speciality neurological/neurosurgical and adolescent medicine wards across two specialist tertiary children's hospitals in Australia were conducted between March and May 2021. Data analysis followed interpretative analysis methods to develop themes and codes which were mapped to a conceptual model of safe care. RESULTS: Six focus groups with 29 nurses of varying experience levels were conducted over 3 months. Themes and codes were mapped to the six themes of the conceptual model: use rapport, know the child, negotiate roles, shared learning, build trust and relationships, and past experiences. The analysis revealed two new themes that extended the conceptual model to include; the unique role of a paediatric nurse, and joy and job satisfaction, with a third contextual theme, impacts of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. With the perspectives of paediatric nurses incorporated into the model we have enhanced our model of safe care specifically for inpatient paediatric nursing care of children and young people with intellectual disability. CONCLUSION: Including perceptions of paediatric nurses confirmed the position of the child with intellectual disability being at the centre of safe care, where care is delivered as a partnership between nursing staff, child or young person and their parents/family and the hospital systems and processes. IMPACT: The enhanced model offers a specialized framework for clinical staff and health managers to optimize the delivery of safe care for children and young people with intellectual disability in hospital.",

The aim of this study was to build on meta-analytic evidence for the efficacy of such interventions in treating somatic or mental health patients. METHODS: Studies eligible for the meta-analysis were identified by a comprehensive literature search in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO and by a manual search (date of last search 22/06/2021). All randomized controlled trials comparing spontaneous laughter or simulated laughter to treatment as usual, no treatment/waitlist, or attention control groups were included. There were no language or date restrictions. Separate random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for mental health, physiological, and physical health outcomes. Hedges' g is reported as the standardized mean difference estimate. The study was registered on PROSPERO (#CRD42019139299). RESULTS: Forty-five studies comprising 2,547 randomized participants were included. Laughter-inducing interventions showed significant positive effects on mental health (31 studies, 1,543 patients, g = 0.74, 95% CI [0.48; 1.00], I2 = 81%), physiological (14 studies, 761 patients, g = 0.61 [0.20; 1.03], I2 = 86%), and physical health outcomes (21 studies, 1,105 patients, g = 0.59 [0.30; 0.88], I2 = 80%). Only one study reported adverse events, which were mild in nature. CONCLUSION: Laughter-inducing interventions can have beneficial effects on a variety of health-related outcomes including mental health, physical health, and physiological parameters. Future research should focus on examining differential intervention effects and mechanisms of action.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged pharmacological interventions have detrimental health consequences by developing drug tolerance or drug resistance, in addition to adverse drug events. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic-related stress has adversely affected the emotional and mental health aspects around the globe. Consequently, depression is growing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides specific pharmacological interventions, which if prolonged have detrimental health consequences, non-pharmacological interventions are needed to minimize the emotional burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Laughter therapy is a universal non-pharmacologic approach to reduce stress and anxiety. Therapeutic laughter is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and easily implementable intervention that can be used during this pandemic as a useful supplementary therapy to reduce the mental health burden. Laughter therapy can physiologically lessen the pro-stress factors and increase the mood-elevating anti-stress factors to reduce anxiety and depression. In this ongoing stressful period of the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping necessary social distancing, it is important to create a cheerful environment that will facilitate laughter among the family, neighbor, and community to cope with the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Nurses need nonpharmacological methods rather than drugs to address women's emotional distress during the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises and laughter therapy on the mental health and treatment outcomes of women receiving IVF treatment. This parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a private IVF center. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG; n = 71) and control group (CG; n = 70). The IG received progressive muscle relaxation and laughter therapy for 40 min in each session for 3-4 sessions, whereas the CG received routine care. Data were obtained from the patient information form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and medical records. The questionnaire was completed at recruitment (T1) and oocyte pick-up day (T2). In the evaluation performed on the day of the oocyte pick-up, depression and trait anxiety scores of the IG were found to be lower than those in the CG, and the effect size was small. Group × time interaction was significant for depression (large effect size) and trait anxiety (small effect size). The estradiol levels, the number of oocytes, transfer status, and pregnancy rates (according to a blood test) were similar between groups. Women receiving IVF treatment who received progressive muscle relaxation and laughter therapy demonstrated psychological changes; however, the treatment did not affect medical outcomes.",

The 19 experimental group participants were given LT twice a week for 2 weeks, whereas the 22 participants in the waiting-list control group received no treatment during the same period but received it afterward. Outcomes were measured right after the completion of the intervention and 2 weeks later. The experimental group showed significantly decreased levels of acculturative stress, anxiety, depression, and salivary cortisol compared to the control group. As for salivary IgA, however, the experimental group showed no statistically significant decrease compared to the control group. An LT program can be a good option for married immigrant women undergoing acculturation experiences in consideration of its effectiveness.",

METHODS: This study used an experimental study with pretest posttest control group. The study population consisted of 5th grade students studying at a secondary school in Turkey. There were six branches in the 5th grade. Groups were randomly selected from among these 5th grade classes to include 29 students in the intervention group and 32 in the control group. Laughter therapy sessions were applied to the intervention group twice a week for 4 weeks. No intervention was offered to the control group. The data were collected by a questionnaire, the School Children's Happiness Inventory, and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. RESULTS: It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the School Children's Happiness Inventory (p < .05) but no significant difference was found according to the groups' scores on the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was determined that laughter therapy increased the happiness level of students yet had no effect on their self-esteem. It is recommended to organize laughter therapy activities in schools to increase the happiness levels of students.",

The prevalence of true giggle incontinence is unknown, with confusion about the diagnosis of urinary incontinence occurring during laughter and true giggle incontinence. The aim of the study is to improve our understanding of urinary incontinence during laughter by comparing those children with children who have DUI at other times, but not with laughter. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of children with DUI who presented to a tertiary continence service from 2017 to 2018, collecting data on age, gender, associated comorbidities, lower urinary tract symptoms, investigations, provisional diagnosis at first visit and initial treatment responses. Differences between those with DUI occurring during laughter and those with DUI at other times, but not with laughter were compared using standard statistical methods. RESULTS: Of the 277 new patients seen during the study period, 140 (51%) had DUI, and of these, 72 (51%) had DUI occurring during laughter. Children with incontinence occurring during laughter were more likely to have incontinence associated with other activities. One child had giggle incontinence according to the International Children's Continence Society's definition. Four other children were referred specifically for urinary incontinence associated with laughter, with the term giggle incontinence sometimes used by the referring doctor. CONCLUSION: Children with DUI commonly experience incontinence during laughter, but true giggle incontinence is rare. Correct diagnosis is essential as it directs treatment.",

The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of prescribing laughter to inform a larger randomised controlled trial. Secondary objectives are to assess if a two-week laughter prescription improves subjective and objective sleep outcomes, wellbeing, and/or psychological health outcomes. TRIAL DESIGN: To assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial for laughter prescription in relation to sleep, psychological health, and wellbeing. Forty university students will be recruited and randomised to one of two conditions (control/experimental). METHODS: Wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries will be used to estimate sleep outcomes during a one-week baseline testing phase and across the two-week intervention. The experimental group will be shown how to record a Laughie (a 1-min recording of their joyful laughter on their smartphone) and prescribed to laugh with it three times daily for 14 days (the control group will only track sleep). All participants will complete the WHO (Five) Well-being Index, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale pre- and post-intervention. The CONSORT checklist, and the Feasibility, Reach-out, Acceptability, Maintenance, Efficacy, Implementation, and Tailorabilty (FRAME-IT) framework will guide intervention planning and evaluation. Participant interviews will be analysed using Differential Qualitative Analysis (DQA). RESULTS: The feasibility of a two-week laughter prescription in university students and its impact on sleep, wellbeing, and/or psychological health outcomes will be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Zayed University Research Ethics Committee approved the study in July 2019. The research will be completed following protocol publication. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov. ID: NCT04171245. Date of registration: 18 October 2019."

Furthermore, alterations in neurotrophic factors might contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a simulated laughter intervention on the levels of cortisol and BDNF and to determine whether the effects associated with simulated laughter could be sustained after discontinuation of the intervention. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, patients with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV clinical criteria were randomly assigned to receive either 8-week-long simulated laughter intervention (n=32) or treatment-as-usual group (control group, n=27). The serum levels of BDNF and cortisol were measured at baseline, week 8, and four weeks after discontinuation (week 12) of the intervention program. RESULTS: After an 8-week simulated laughter intervention, the laughter group had significantly higher levels of BDNF; however, four weeks after discontinuation of the intervention, the levels of BDNF significantly dropped. Interestingly, the levels of cortisol did not change significantly at week 8, but they were significantly elevated at week 12. The levels of BDNF and cortisol in the control group did not change significantly between week 0 and week 8. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the simulated laughter intervention has an early effect on neurogenesis with a significant delayed effect on stress regulation in subjects with schizophrenia."

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of laughter therapy (LT) on depression and quality of life (QOL) of the elderly living in Abadeh nursing homes. METHODS: This is a controlled semi-experimental study with a pre-test, post-test design. Ninety eligible ones of the elderly living in the Abadeh nursing homes and from July to September 2017, entered the study. Some of the criteria for entering the study include being over 60 years old, orientation, not having blindness and deafness, lack of physical and mental problems. After determining the intervention and control groups, the scale of depression and QOL was administered to the subjects and their scores were collected in the pre-test. RESULTS: Most of the study samples were in the intervention (35.55%) and control (37.77%) group in the age range of 60-69 years. In both intervention and control groups, respectively, 31.11% and 68.88% elderly were males and females. The mean scores of depression in the intervention group after LT (M = 2.57) were lower than those before the intervention (M = 6.87) [CI = -5.58-(-3.02)] and also the results of independent t-test showed a statistically significant difference before and after the intervention between the two groups (P < 0.001). The mean score of dimensions of QOL after LT was higher than that before in the intervention and there was a statistically significant difference in all dimensions with paired t-test (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Since the implementation of this programme could improve the mental status and QOL of the elderly, this method of therapy can be used as an alternative or complementary model to enhance the health of the elderly."

The study objective was to measure the effect of intradialytic group laughter therapy on depressive symptoms in people on hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial conducted with prevalent HD patients in 10 centers in Northern California. The intervention group received a once weekly, 30-minute group laughter therapy session for 8 weeks. Primary outcome was the number of people with depressive symptoms as measured using the four Item Patient Health Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were anxiety, subjective well-being, and patient-reported outcome measures. FINDINGS: In all, 151 participants completed both predepression and postdepression symptom measures (72 intervention and 79 control). The proportion of patients with self-reported depressive symptoms changed from 17 (22%) to 16 (20%), in the control and from 11 (17%) to 5 (8%) in the intervention arms, respectively (P = 0.04). In the control arm, 7 out of the 17 patients with self-reported depressive symptoms at baseline continued to report depressive symptoms at follow up compared to the intervention arm where only 1 of 12 patients continued to report depressive symptoms. No differences were noted between the groups for reported anxiety, patient-reported dialysis symptoms, and subjective well-being. DISCUSSION: This study found intradialytic group laughter can decrease the number of people with depressive symptoms receiving hemodialysis. Larger and long-term studies are required to evaluate the effect of intradialytic laughter on patient related outcomes and quality of life.",

CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy man in his late twenties was admitted several times over the course of half a year. He had acute episodes of reduced consciousness, involuntary movements and psychotic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Initial examinations were normal except for a positive urine drug screen (tetrahydrocannabinol), and the patient was diagnosed with cannabinoid intoxication. During the next admission cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild pleocytosis. Screening for anti-neuronal antibodies was negative, but anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were detected in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. He was successfully given steroid treatment on a tentative diagnosis of SREAT, but relapsed when the steroids were discontinued. After receiving a prolonged steroid treatment with gradual dose reduction over a year, he remains symptom-free 18 months after treatment discontinuation. INTERPRETATION: The diagnostic delay might have been mitigated with an earlier inclusion of neuroimmunological disorders in the differential diagnosis. Unexplained pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of paroxysmal neuropsychiatric symptoms should trigger an investigation that includes autoimmune encephalopathies.",

      "abstract": "Stress is one of the foremost contributors to the development of psychiatric diseases. Since the prevalence of stress-related complaints is increasing, we are in need for affordable and effective treatment alternatives. Laughter yoga (LY), a popular method encouraging participants to simulate laughter and participate in yogic breathing exercises, is hypothesized to buffer negative effects of stress. Although widely practiced, empirical evidence for beneficial effects of LY is scarce. We investigated the acute effects of a single 30-min LY session on the autonomic, endocrine and psychological response to a standardized psychosocial stressor. Thirty-five healthy subjects (51% female) were randomly assigned to experience either a LY (n = 11), a relaxation breathing (n = 12) or a (non-intervention) control (n = 12) session prior to their exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G). Salivary cortisol, salivary alpha amylase, and subjective stress were assessed repeatedly throughout the experiment. We expected that LY and relaxation breathing group each show a downregulation of stress response indices compared to the control group. Further, we expected that LY has beneficial effects compared to relaxation breathing. The groups did not differ in salivary cortisol, alpha amylase or subjective stress reactivity during the 30-min intervention. However, in response to the TSST-G, the LY, but neither the relaxation breathing, nor the control condition, showed an attenuated cortisol stress response. These findings highlight the potential of LY to buffer the endocrine stress response. Therefore, LY could be used as a cheap and easily-to-implement add-on to more traditional stress interventions. LAY SUMMARY In recent years, more and more people have reported to feel stressed. Although our body is well equipped to deal with acute stress, chronic stress can tire our system and contribute to illness in the long run. Therefore, we need affordable and effective measures to reduce stress. In this study we have investigated whether a single laughter yoga session can help us to deal with acute stress. Although laughter yoga did not change how stressful a situation was perceived, it reduced the amount of stress hormones that were released in response to the situation. As such, laughter yoga might be a cheap and easily-to-implement add-on to more traditional stress reduction interventions.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a Laughter Program on psychological stress, by assessing salivary cortisol and the subjective happiness of student nurses in order to relieve employment stress. METHODS: A quasi-experimental, non-equivalent, control-group, and pre-test/post-test was conducted in 4th year student nurses (n = 48) from 2 universities in Korea at a time when participants' final exams and job searches were simultaneously occurring. Physiological stress (salivary cortisol), and psychological stress measured using modified Cornell Medical Index questionnaire and the Subjective Happiness Scale were used to determine the effects of the program. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that the Laughter Program was effective in relieving employment stress and increasing the subjective well-being of student nurses. Psychological stress (p < 0.001), salivary cortisol levels (p < 0.001), and subjective happiness (p < 0.001) were statistically significantly improved after the intervention compared with before the Laughter Program. CONCLUSION: This study is an effective evidence-based intervention to reduce student nurses employment stress and improve subjective happiness."

A combination of psychological approaches and pharmacological treatments can be a significantly effective treatment for IBS. The main objective of the present study was to provide a therapeutic plan based on laughter yoga and anti-anxiety medication, employed for the very first time, and to determine the effectiveness of these treatments on the anxiety and GI symptoms of patients with IBS. METHODS In this randomized, controlled, clinical trial, the participants were 60 patients selected from those who referred to the GI clinic of Vali-asr Hospital (Birjand, Iran) during the study period (April 2017 to March 2017) and were diagnosed as having IBS based on ROME III criteria. The participants were randomly assigned to either the laughter yoga group, the anti-anxiety medication group, or the symptomatic treatment (control) group. Severity levels of anxiety and GI symptoms before and after intervention were determined and compared among these three groups according to approved protocols. RESULTS The severity of IBS symptoms after the interventions was more greatly reduced in the laughter yoga group than in the anti-anxiety medication and control groups (p = 0.006). The severity of anxiety after interventions decreased in all three groups, especially in the yoga treatment group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1). CONCLUSION Laughter yoga is more effective than anti-anxiety medication in reducing the GI symptoms of patients with IBS. Therefore, applying laughter yoga along with common pharmacological therapies for patients with IBS might be strongly advised."

Accordingly, the management of patients' discomfort is an integral part of treating chronic pain. Such treatment, however, is not effective for many patients. We investigated whether mirthful laughter provided by comic relief can influence pain tolerance and muscle soreness in young healthy participants. METHODS: Forty participants underwent a randomized controlled cross-over designed experiment. Each participant was exposed to a comedy video eliciting mirthful laughter and an uninteresting documentary. Delayed onset muscle soreness was induced in one leg at a time by eccentric exercise. Pain tolerance was tested using blunt force application and assessed subjectively using a visual analog scale. RESULTS: Watching the comedy video elicited a significantly greater irregular breathing pattern compared with watching the documentary video (p < 0.001). After watching the comedy, the participants' positive affect was increased (Δ2 ± 1) while it was largely decreased (Δ-11 ± 2) after watching the documentary video (p < 0.001). Pain tolerance was decreased by 17 ± 5 N after viewing the documentary video (p < 0.001), but did not change significantly after watching the comedy. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty minutes of watching a comedy eliciting laughter favorably influenced pain tolerance in healthy humans. CLINICAL TRIAL NO.: #NCT02896075.",

This study aims to evaluate the benefits of integrative laughter therapy (ILT) on levels of self-esteem, anxiety, and happiness in patients treated for addiction at a day hospital (DH). A prospective, naturalistic study with a pre-post design was conducted. All 185 participants received the standard, multicomponent treatment at the DH (treatment as usual; TAU). The participants were also invited to attend weekly ILT sessions. Upon completion of the 2-month DH treatment program, patients were classified according to their attendance at the ILT sessions: patients who attended ≥80% constituted the experimental group (TAU + ILT group) while those who attended <80% were considered controls. Although both groups achieved statistically significant increases in self-esteem and happiness with a decrease in trait anxiety, the improvement on these variables was significantly greater in the TAU + ILT group. Subject to the limitations inherent to quasi-experimental research, the findings of the present study suggest that the addition of an ILT module to the standard treatment in a DH for addictive disorders may yield greater improvement in self-esteem, anxiety, and happiness compared to TAU.",

In the initial management of this patient's SVT, traditional vagal maneuvers (including the valsalva maneuver and stimulation of the mammalian divers reflex) were attempted unsuccessfully. While awaiting further treatment, nursing staff presented the patient with an inflated examination glove that had been crafted into the shape of an elephant. This resulted in a fit of laughter that appeared to terminate the child's arrhythmia. Existing studies identified in the literature help to establish a correlation between the thoracic and cardiovascular physiology of laughter and the mechanics of the traditional Valsalva maneuver. Our patient's case highlights the potential positive impact of this physiology when applied in the context of the paediatric patient presenting in SVT. In the context of the available evidence, the case of our 10-year-old patient serves as a thought-provoking example of the real world relationship between laughter and the traditional Valsalva maneuver. The utility of laughter in the management of supraventricular tachycardia is an area that warrants further investigation.",

This study aimed to evaluate these effects as an exploratory endpoint in cancer patients as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institution in Japan. METHODS: The Initiative On Smile And CAncer (iOSACA) study was an open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in 2017 in which participants aged 40-64 years with cancer were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (laughter therapy) or control group (no laughter therapy). Each participant in the intervention group underwent a laughter therapy session once every two weeks for seven weeks (total of four sessions). Each session involved a laughter yoga routine followed by Rakugo or Manzai traditional Japanese verbal comedy performances. We assessed QOL as a secondary endpoint in this intention-to-treat population using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The questionnaire was completed at baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 3 and 7. Mixed-effects models for repeated measures were developed to compare time-dependent changes in each QOL domain from baseline between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: Four participants retracted consent and one participant was retrospectively excluded from analysis due to unmet inclusion criteria. The analysis was conducted using 56 participants, with 26 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group. Questionnaire completion rates were high (>90%), with similar QOL scores reported at baseline in both groups. The mixed-effects models showed that the intervention group had significantly better cognitive function and less pain than the control group for a short period. CONCLUSION: Laughter therapy may represent a beneficial, noninvasive complementary intervention in the clinical setting. Further studies are needed to verify the hypotheses generated from this exploratory study.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Laughter-inducing therapies are being applied more regularly in the last decade, and the number of scientific reports of their beneficial effects is growing. Laughter-inducing therapies could be cost-effective treatments for different populations as a complementary or main therapy. A systematic review and meta-analysis has not yet been performed on these therapies for different populations and outcomes, but is needed to examine their potential benefits. This research aims to broadly describe the field of laughter-inducing therapies, and to estimate their effect on mental and physical health for a broad range of populations and conditions. METHOD: A systematic review of the field was undertaken, followed by a meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi-experimental studies. The systematic review included intervention studies, one-session therapies, lab studies and narrative reviews to provide a broad overview of the field. The meta-analysis included RCTs or quasi-experimental studies that assessed multi-session laughter or humor therapies compared to a control group, performed on people of any age, healthy or with a mental or physical condition. English and non-English articles were searched using PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO and EMBASE. Search terms included laugh(ing), laughter, humo(u)r, program, therapy, yoga, exercise, intervention, method, unconditional, spontaneous, simulated, forced. Studies were classified as using humor ('spontaneous' laughter) or not using humor ('simulated' laughter). RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that (1) 'simulated' (non-humorous) laughter is more effective than 'spontaneous' (humorous) laughter, and (2) laughter-inducing therapies can improve depression. However, overall study quality was low, with substantial risk of bias in all studies. With rising health care costs and the increasing elderly population, there is a potential for low-cost, simple interventions that can be administered by staff with minimal training. Laughter-inducing therapies show a promise as an addition to main therapies, but more methodologically rigorous research is needed to provide evidence for this promise.",

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu, and Wanfang Data were searched from their inception up to December 2018. REVIEW METHODS: The reporting of this meta-analytical review was conducted according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. Two reviewers selected the studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias (Cochrane Collaboration bias assessment tool) of the included papers independently. RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 814 participants were included. Meta-analysis showed that these interventions significantly decreased adults' depression, anxiety, and improved their sleep quality. The results of subgroup analysis showed that depression benefits more from long-term laughter intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis revealed that laughter and humour interventions are effective in relieving depression, anxiety, and improve sleep quality in adults. More studies with high quality and follow-up assessment should be conducted for future research. IMPACT: This review synthesized current evidence using laughter and humour interventions to reduce negative emotion and promote better results in adults, especially with respect to target the applicability between different populations or intervention methods. In addition, humour and laughter interventions are safe, convenient, interesting and can promote interpersonal relationship in both patients and medical workers, which have great feasibility and potential to be used as an aspect of psychotherapy for clinical and nursing to improve well-beings in adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laughter Yoga (LY) is a group-based intervention involving simulated laughter, gentle stretching, rhythmic breathing and meditation. There is some limited evidence that LY reduces depressive symptoms over the short term. However, the quality of previous LY studies is poor and none involved working-aged people with a clinical diagnosis of depression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility and potential efficacy of LY for improving residual mood, anxiety and stress symptoms in adults diagnosed with depression. METHODS: Fifty participants were randomised to the group LY intervention (n = 23) consisting of eight sessions over four weeks, or treatment-as-usual (n = 27). Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Short Form 12 item Health Survey at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T2). LY participants also completed a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ8) at T1 and eleven participated in individual qualitative interviews at T2. RESULTS: The LY group had statistically greater decreases in depression and improvements in mental health related quality of life compared to the control group from T0 to T1. The CSQ8 scores indicated a favourable level of satisfaction with the LY intervention. The qualitative interviews highlighted aspects of the intervention that were effective and those requiring modification. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the small sample size and treatment-as-usual control group. CONCLUSIONS: A full scale RCT of LY could be feasible if some modifications were made to the protocol/intervention. The intervention may be effective to improve depression and mental health related quality of life immediately post intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has become necessary to develop mental health management methods that do not require specialized skills or tools to implement. With this in mind, we performed a subjective and objective investigation of the stress-reducing effect of hearing laughter. METHODS: Ninety healthy students were randomly assigned to a laughter (n = 45) or rest (n = 45) group. Both groups were then administered the Uchida-Kraepelin test for 15 min, which served as a stress-loading method. The laughter group listened to a specially prepared CD for five minutes, while the rest group rested for five minutes. The participants' subjective stress level was assessed using a visual analogue scale and their physiological status was assessed by measuring blood pressure and monitoring heart rate variability. RESULTS: The visual analogue scale score for subjective stress was found to decrease significantly in both the laughter and rest groups after the intervention. However, a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant interaction and main effects for the change in heart rate and the natural logarithm of the high-frequency component of heart rate variability (lnHF). A post-hoc analysis using Dunnett's test showed that hearing laughter caused the lnHF to significantly increase compared to that recorded during the Uchida-Kraepelin test and the rest period. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hearing laughter might produce a relaxing effect by increasing parasympathetic nervous activity. This would make it an easily accessible method for improving the recovery process of the autonomic nervous system after a stress-loading task that does not require specialized skills or tools.

      "abstract": "Gelastic seizures (GS) are a rare form of epilepsy characterized by inappropriate, uncontrolled laughter. They are highly associated with abnormal cognitive development and behavioral problems in patients. Research has shown that GS can originate from hypothalamic hamartomas (HH), non- neoplastic masses consisting of gray matter with large and small neurons interspersed with glial nuclei. GS have also been observed in patients with frontal and temporal lobe lesions. The patient in this case report is a 40-year-old man with a past medical history significant for brain tumor, diabetes mellitus, and schizophrenia who presented with a long standing history of sudden, involuntary laughter occurring 2-3 times a week since 8 years old. Since the onset of these laughing spells the patient has displayed gradual cognitive impairment and increasing behavioral problems. Subsequent EEG (21-channel electroencephalogram) showed focal epileptiform activity in the right frontotemporal region and MRI studies revealed a mass arising from the hypothalamus suggestive of a HH. Other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis for laughing spells and distinguishing different causes can be challenging. As demonstrated by this case report, in patients with behavioral issues, especially those with inappropriate uncontrolled laughter, gelastic seizures need to be included in the differential diagnosis. Thus, a thorough workup should include neuroimaging with attention to the suprasellar region and EEG. Accurate, early diagnosis and patient education are critical in avoiding excessive and unnecessary treatments. This condition may be pharmacoresistant and is often associated with progressive cognitive and behavioral issues. Studies have shown a surgical treatment approach may be effective.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pathological laughter is defined as uncontrollable and inappropriate laughter unrelated to an emotion or a mood. This symptom can reveal a stroke. CASE REPORT: We described the case of a 57-year-old patient who presented to the emergency department 2 h after a sudden onset of left hemiparesis preceded by pathological laughter. The left motor weakness was very discrete and underestimated because of severe behavioral changes, that is, laughter, joviality, and motor restlessness. Despite abnormal brain imaging results, symptoms were considered as atypical to evoke a stroke. The patient did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging performed 2 days after admission confirmed the diagnosis of stroke. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians are at the forefront of stroke management. They should be aware that the initial symptom of a stroke can be atypical and lead to misunderstanding the diagnosis. Because the treatment of stroke requires the fastest care, it is important for emergency physicians to know that sudden behavioral troubles and pathological laughter can reveal strokes.",

Salivary cortisol and DHEA levels were measured immediately before, immediately after, and 30 min after the intervention. RESULTS: Cortisol levels and C/D ratios significantly decreased by time in the LY and comedy movie groups. Significant group*time interactions were found between these two groups for cortisol levels and C/D ratios. DHEA levels did not change by time in the LY group. CONCLUSIONS: LY decreased cortisol levels and C/D ratios but did not affect DHEA levels. Simulated and spontaneous laughter differently affected the dynamics of cortisol levels and C/D ratios.

There has been no systematic review of laughter yoga intervention studies and thus evidence of its effects on mental health is unclear. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Laughter Yoga interventions improved depressive symptoms in two studies over the short term. There is a lack of good quality evidence to show that laughter yoga is more effective than other group-based interventions in improving mental health. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Well-conducted and clearly reported trials of laughter yoga are needed before the intervention can be considered as an evidence-based intervention to improve mental health. ABSTRACT: Introduction Laughter Yoga is claimed to promote mental health and is increasingly popular worldwide. Despite its popularity, there has been no systematic review of Laughter Yoga intervention studies and thus evidence of its effects on mental health is unclear. Aim This review aimed to critically evaluate the effects of group-based Laughter Yoga on improving mental health in adults. Method We conducted a systematic review of experimental studies (published from 1995 to 2017). Study quality was assessed, the effect sizes for individual mental health outcomes were calculated and all reviewed studies were narratively synthesized. Results Six experimental studies with inconsistent results were included in this review. The most promising effect of Laughter Yoga is the improvement of depressive symptoms, indicating significant medium-large effect sizes in two studies over the short term. The overall level of evidence was weak due to poor study quality and risks of bias. Discussion Laughter Yoga shows potential, but currently there is insufficient evidence to support its effectiveness in improving mental health when compared to other group-based interventions. Implications for practice This review highlights the need to conduct rigorous trials of laughter yoga before the intervention can be considered as an evidence-based intervention to improve mental health.",

METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study with a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design. The study participants were older adults living in two nursing homes set up by foundations located in the capital of Turkey. A total of 50 older adults formed the intervention group (n = 20) and control group (n = 30). The intervention group received laughter therapy twice a week for 5 weeks. The control group received no intervention. Data were collected using a socio-demographic form, the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS) and the Turkish Death Anxiety Scale (TDAS). RESULTS: After laughter therapy, the DJGLS total and subscale (emotional and social loneliness) scores decreased among older adults in the intervention group (p < 0.005). While there were no significant differences for overall TDAS, death uncertainty and pain subscales scores between the intervention and control group after laughter therapy, there was a significant decrease in TDAS exposure subscale scores of the intervention group (p < 0.005). DISCUSSION: The results suggest that laughter therapy can be used to decrease levels of loneliness and death anxiety among older adults living in nursing homes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Anxiety regarding death and loneliness are important issues that affect quality of life in older adults. This first pilot study demonstrates the beneficial effects of laughter therapy on loneliness and death anxiety in nursing home residents. Nurses can incorporate laughter therapy into routine programmes in nursing homes.",

RESULTS: There were significant differences in perceived stress, psychological stress response, fasting blood sugar, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha between the two groups after the program. However, there were no significant differences in normalized low frequency (norm LF), normalized high frequency (norm HF), LF/HF ratio, and cortisol between the two groups after the program.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is a well-established treatment for the management of motor complications in Parkinson's disease. Uncontrollable laughter has been reported as a rare side effect of STN stimulation. The precise mechanism responsible for this unique phenomenon remains unclear. We examined in detail the DBS electrode position and stimulation parameters in two patients with uncontrollable laughter during programming after STN-DBS surgery and illustrated the anatomical correlates of the acute mood changes with STN stimulation. CASE REPORT: Unilateral STN-DBS induced uncontrollable laughter with activation of the most ventral contacts in both patients. However, the location of the electrodes responsible for this adverse effect differed between the patients. In the first patient, the DBS lead was placed more inferiorly and medially within the STN. In the second patient, the DBS lead was implanted more anteriorly and inferiorly than initially planned at the level of the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr). CONCLUSION: Unilateral STN-DBS can induce acute uncontrollable laughter with activation of electrodes located more anterior, medial, and inferior in relationship with the standard stereotactic STN target. We suggest that simulation of ventral and medial STN, surrounding limbic structures or the SNr, is the most plausible anatomical substrate responsible for this acute mood and behavioral change. Our findings provide insight into the complex functional neuroanatomical relationship of the STN and adjacent structures important for mood and behavior. DBS programming with more dorsal and lateral contacts within the STN should be entertained to minimize the emotional side effects."

DESIGN: A systematic search of Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, PsychInfo, AMED, and PsychArticles used inclusive terms relating to laughter and humour interventions. A realist synthesis approach enabled heterogeneous interventions to be compared pragmatically. SETTING: Five laughter interventions, and one humour intervention, using one or more outcome related to well-being, were considered for inclusion after screening 178 primary research papers. The five laughter interventions, representing a sample of 369 participants, were retained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Well-being related outcome measures reported in each intervention informed efficacy; Joanna Briggs Institute tools appraised design; and a realist approach enabled heterogeneous interventions to be measured on their overall potential to provide an evidence base. RESULTS: Well-being related measures demonstrated at least one significant positive effect in all interventions. Confounding factors inherent in the intervention types were observed. Individual participant laughter was not reported. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter and humour interventions appear to enhance well-being. There is insufficient evidence for the potential of laughter itself to increase well-being as interventions contained a range of confounding factors and did not measure participant laughter. Interventions that isolate, track, and measure the parameters of individual laughter are recommended to build evidence for these potentially attractive and low-risk interventions. The classification proposed may guide the development of both evidence-oriented and population-appropriate intervention designs.",

Laughter therapy is being used as an intervention to positively influence individuals experiencing various forms of emotional distress. Community care workers play a vital role in the support of the HIV/AIDS-infected and -affected members in communities. The nature of this type of work and their limited training contributes to high levels of secondary trauma and emotional exhaustion. The purpose of the study was firstly, to explore the effects of working with orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) on the community care workers and secondly, to establish the impact that laughter therapy has to positively combat stresses of working within the care workers' environment. All the community care workers from a community-based organisation that provides care for HIV/AIDS-infected and -affected OVC and their families in the greater region of Soweto, South Africa, took part in daily laughter therapy sessions for one month. To assess the experiences of participants of laughter therapy, seven community care workers agreed to participate in a mixed method assessment. Interviews were conducted before and after the intervention using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis as framework. As supportive data, a stress and anxiety and depression scale were added in the interview. Participants reported more positive emotions, positive coping, improved interpersonal relationships and improvement in their care work after exposure to laughter therapy. Quantitative results on stress, anxiety and depression for each participant confirmed observed changes. Laughter therapy as a self-care technique has potential as a low-cost intervention strategy to reduce stress and counteract negative emotions among people working in highly emotional environments.",

It was not until 1976 that scientists thought about laughter as a form of therapy that can modulate hormonal and immunological parameters that affect the outcome of many serious diseases. Moreover, laughter therapy was shown to be beneficial in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by delaying the onset of many diabetic complications. Laughter is also described to influence the cardiovascular and endothelial functions and thus may protect against diabetic cardiovascular complications. In this review, we outline the different biochemical, physiological and immunological mechanisms by which laughter may influence the overall state of wellbeing and enhance disease prognosis. We also focus on the biological link between laughter therapy and diabetic cardiovascular complications as well as the underlying mechanisms involved in T2DM. METHODS: Reviewing all the essential databases for \"laughter\" and \"type 2 diabetes mellitus\". RESULTS: Although laughter therapy is still poorly investigated, recent studies show that laughter may retard the onset of diabetic complications, enhance cardiovascular functions and rectify homeostatic abnormalities associated with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter therapy is effective in delaying diabetic complications and should be used as an adjuvant therapy.",

BACKGROUND: By improving the quality of life of residents living in nursing homes and allowing them to have a healthier existence, their lives can be extended. Therefore, interventions impacting the quality of life of older adults are of critical importance. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental design. METHOD: The study was conducted between 2 March - 25 May 2015. The experimental group was composed of 32 nursing home residents from one nursing home, while the control group consisted of 33 nursing home residents from another nursing home in the capital city of Turkey. Laughter therapy was applied with nursing home residents of the experimental group two days per week (21 sessions in total). A socio-demographic form and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were used for data collection. RESULTS: After the laughter therapy intervention, general and subscales (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and spiritual health) quality-of-life scores of residents in the experimental group significantly increased in comparison with the pretest. CONCLUSION: Laughter therapy improved the quality of life of nursing home residents. Therefore, nursing home management should integrate laughter therapy into health care and laughter therapy should be provided as a routine nursing intervention. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results indicated that the laughter therapy programme had a positive effect on the quality of life of nursing home residents. Nurses can use laughter therapy as an intervention to improve quality of life of nursing home residents.",

OBJECTIVE: Develop and study a novel community Improvisation Theater (IT) program for PD in order to improve quality of life. METHODS: A prospective, rater-blinded, modified cross-over design study of IT for PD. 22 subjects were randomized 1:1 to active-start (AS) or control-start (CS) groups, controlling for age and Hoehn and Yahr stage. Participants were recruited from the Northwestern PD and Movement Disorders Center. 60 min IT sessions were led by The Second City® faculty weekly for 12 weeks. The primary aim was to assess feasibility, determined as 70% of participants attending at least 75% of the classes. Exploratory data were obtained comparing pre- and post-intervention outcomes using Wilcoxon signed rank test for UPDRS parts I-IV, PDQ-39, and 5 neuro-QoL measures (communication, anxiety, stigma, depression, and wellbeing). RESULTS: All 22 participants completed the study. 21/22 (95%) participants attended at least 80% of the classes. All participants indicated that they would recommend the class to others with PD. 21/22 participants enjoyed the class and felt it was beneficial for their symptoms. A significant improvement pre-to-post intervention was seen with the UPDRS part II ADL measure (mean -1.5, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: A novel improvisation program can be well-attended, enjoyable, and improve ADL measures among patients with PD of varying ages and disease severity.",

Lack of PA enjoyment may be a barrier to PA participation. Combining simulated laughter and PA for strength, balance, and flexibility is a potential solution for helping older adults maintain independence in activities of daily living through enjoyable participation in PA. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study is to assess whether combining simulated laughter exercises with a moderate-intensity strength, balance, and flexibility PA program (i.e., LaughActive) increases participation in PA, health, and self-efficacy for PA among older adults residing in 4 assisted living facilities (ALFs). DESIGN AND METHODS: The 12-week wait list control pilot study used pre- and 6-week post-intervention comparisons within and between groups identified by paired sample t-test results among those who participated in twice-weekly LaughActive classes (n = 27). RESULTS: Significant improvements (p < .05-.10) were observed in mental health (SF-36v2), aerobic endurance (2-minute step test), and self-efficacy for exercise (OEE). IMPLICATIONS: PA programs that elicit positive emotions through simulated laughter have the potential to improve health, physical performance, and self-efficacy for PA among older adults and may positively influence participant adherence.",

      "abstract": "In modern society, fierce competition and socioeconomic interaction stress the quality of life, causing a negative influence on a person's mental health. Laughter is a positive sensation, and seems to be a useful and healthy way to overcome stress. Laughter therapy is a kind of cognitive-behavioral therapies that could make physical, psychological, and social relationships healthy, ultimately improving the quality of life. Laughter therapy, as a non-pharmacological, alternative treatment, has a positive effect on the mental health and the immune system. In addition, laughter therapy does not require specialized preparations, such as suitable facilities and equipment, and it is easily accessible and acceptable. For these reasons, the medical community has taken notice and attempted to include laughter therapy to more traditional therapies. Decreasing stress-making hormones found in the blood, laughter can mitigate the effects of stress. Laughter decreases serum levels of cortisol, epinephrine, growth hormone, and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (a major dopamine catabolite), indicating a reversal of the stress response. Depression is a disease, where neurotransmitters in the brain, such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, are reduced, and there is something wrong in the mood control circuit of the brain. Laughter can alter dopamine and serotonin activity. Furthermore, endorphins secreted by laughter can help when people are uncomfortable or in a depressed mood. Laughter therapy is a noninvasive and non-pharmacological alternative treatment for stress and depression, representative cases that have a negative influence on mental health. In conclusion, laughter therapy is effective and scientifically supported as a single or adjuvant therapy.",

Laughter has been shown to generally improve mood in physically healthy adults, and specifically in adults with heart disease or cancer, but little research exists regarding the impact of laughter in adults with Parkinson׳s disease. Low mood is frequently a co-morbid condition for adults with Parkinson׳s disease, and can negatively affect their caregivers. DESIGN: Pre-experimental (O1 × O2) pretest-posttest design. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Data collection occurred at six unique PD support groups in Southern California. SUBJECTS: Participants (N = 85) comprised a convenience sample of adults diagnosed with Parkinson׳s disease (n = 47) and accompanying caregivers (n = 38). INTERVENTION: Subjects participated in a 45-min Laughter Yoga (LY) session conducted by a Certified Laughter Yoga Teacher. OUTCOME MEASURES: This study utilized the Laughter Yoga \"How Do You Feel?\" (HDYF) form. The form consists of a series of 10 scales labeled \"well-being\" measures including enthusiasm, energy level, mood, optimism, stress level, level of friendship with group members, level of awareness about breathing, level of muscle relaxation, level of mental relaxation, and ability to laugh without a reason. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Paired sample t-tests reveal statistically significant improvements in well-being for adults with PD and their caregivers after attending an LY session. Therapists and other clinicians should consider utilizing this unique technique with adults with PD to address co-morbid low-mood conditions and include caregivers in the LY sessions for support and their own benefit.",
