      "abstract": "Background: Carbohydrate mouth rinsing (CHOmr), a nutritional intervention for delaying fatigue and meeting the energy demands of soccer, and the motivational strategy of coach encouragement (CE) are widely recognized as effective approaches for enhancing athletic performance in soccer. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the effects of CHOmr + CE, CHOmr, and CE on heart rate (HR) and kinematic profiles during four-a-side small-sided soccer games (SSGs). Methods: Twenty-four young soccer players (age: 17.2 ± 0.8 years) played six bouts of four-a-side SSGs with CHOmr + CE, CHOmr, or CE at 3-day intervals in a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, or crossover study design. The HR and kinematic responses were continuously recorded during all games. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in peak heart rate (HRpeak) (p ≥ 0.05, F = 0.326, p = 0.723, η2 = 0.014) and mean heart rate (HRmean) (p ≥ 0.05, F = 0.845, p = 0.436, η2 = 0.035). No significant differences were found for distances in Zone 1 (p ≥ 0.05, F = 1.21, p = 0.306, η2 = 0.050), Zone 4 (p ≥ 0.05, F = 0.310, p = 0.735, η2 = 0.013), Zone 5 (p ≥ 0.05, F = 1.02, p = 0.368, η2 = 0.042), or Zone 6 (p ≥ 0.05, F = 0.161, p = 0.211, η2 = 0.055), nor acceleration (p ≥ 0.05, F = 0.208, p = 0.137, η2 = 0.083) and deceleration (p ≥ 0.05, F = 0.790, p = 0.460, η2 = 0.033). Similarly, although no significant differences were observed in the distance in Zone 3 (p ≥ 0.05, F = 3.12, p = 0.054, η2 = 0.119) or repeated sprint distance (p ≥ 0.05, F = 2.96, p = 0.062, η2 = 0.114), the CHOmr +CE group exhibited higher average values for these variables. However, a statistically significant difference was observed in the distance covered in Zone 2 (p ≤ 0.05, F = 3.89, p = 0.028, η2 = 0.145), with the CHOmr +CE group performing better, as confirmed by the post-hoc analyses. Conclusions: Although our findings indicate that CE alone may influence kinematic profiles during SSGs, similar to CHOmr or its combination with CE, further research should explore the underlying mechanisms and potential contextual factors influencing these outcomes. Therefore, we suggest that coaches prefer CE because it is easy to implement.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mouth rinsing (MR) with a carbohydrate solution is one of the most popular methods athletes use to improve their game-based performance due to its acute ergogenic effect. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the carbohydrate MR intervention on psychophysiological responses and kinematic profiles during intermittent (INT) and continuous (CON) 4-a-side small-sided soccer games (SSGs). METHODS: Thirty-two adolescent soccer players (age: 16.5 ± 0.5 years) played six bouts of 4-a-side SSGs with MRINT or MRCON at 3-day intervals in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and crossover study design. Psychophysiological responses and kinematic profiles were continuously recorded during all games. The rating of perceived exertion (RPE), the rating scale of mental effort (RSME), and the physical enjoyment scores (PES) were also determined at the end of each game. RESULTS: The MRCON induced higher psychophysiological responses such as RPE, internal training load (ITL), and RSME (p ≤ 0.05, d values ranging from 0.50 to 1.04 [small to moderate effect]). Conversely, the MRINT induced higher PES (p ≤ 0.05, d values = 1.44 [large effect]) compared to MRCON. Although the MR intervention led to similar improvements in the performance of 4-a-side MRINT and MRCON, there was no significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the MR intervention can be used as an effective ergogenic supplement for acute game performance enhancement, regardless of the game's structure.",

      "abstract": "We examined if carbohydrate (CHO) mouth rinse may reduce central fatigue and perceived exertion, thus improving maximal incremental test (MIT) performance. Nine recreational cyclists warmed up for 6 min before rinsing a carbohydrate (CHO) or placebo (PLA) solution in their mouth for 10 s in a double-blind, counterbalanced manner. Thereafter, they performed the MIT (25 W·min-1 increases until exhaustion) while cardiopulmonary and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) responses were obtained. Pre- to post-MIT alterations in voluntary activation (VA) and peak twitch torque (Tw) were determined. Time-to-exhaustion (p = 0.24), peak power output (PPO; p = 0.45), and V̇O2MAX (p = 0.60) were comparable between conditions. Neither treatment main effect nor time-treatment interaction effect were observed in the first and second ventilatory threshold when expressed as absolute or relative V̇O2 (p = 0.78 and p = 0.96, respectively) and power output (p = 0.28 and p = 0.45, respectively) values, although with moderate-to-large effect sizes. RPE increased similarly throughout the tests and was comparable at the ventilatory thresholds (p = 0.56). Despite the time main effect revealing an MIT-induced central and peripheral fatigue as indicated by the reduced VA and Tw, CHO mouth rinse was ineffective in attenuating both fatigues. Hence, rinsing the mouth with CHO was ineffective in reducing central fatigue, lowering RPE, and improving MIT performance expressed as PPO and time-to-exhaustion. However, moderate-to-large effect sizes in power output values at VT1 and VT2 may suggest some beneficial CHO mouth rinse effects on these MIT outcomes."

      "abstract": "Training volume is one of the critical variables required to promote resistance training benefits (e. g., hypertrophy, muscular strength). Thus, strategies to improve training volume are required. We tested the hypothesis that there is an increase in performance and reduction in the rate of perceived exertion in strength training with caffeine supplementation, carbohydrate mouth rinse, and a synergistic effect of caffeine supplementation plus carbohydrate mouth rinse. We recruited 29 physically active women: 24±4 years, 60.0±7.9 kg, 161.0±6.0 cm. This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and crossover one. The subjects performed all sessions of strength training under different conditions: caffeine (6.5 mg·kg-1 body mass); carbohydrate (6 g of maltodextrin rinsed for 10 s); caffeine plus carbohydrate; or placebo. We applied the ANOVA for repeated measures through the null-hypothesis statistical test, and the Bayes factors analyses approach. The subjects showed significant improvement in the total repetitions (P<0.01; BF10 ~99%) for both lower and upper limb exercises in all conditions compared to placebo without difference among interventions. The rate of perceived exertion (P>0.05) did not differ among interventions. However, BF10 analyses showed a higher probability of lower RPE for CAF intervention. We conclude that either caffeine supplementation or carbohydrate mouth rinse can improve performance in resistance training. There is no additional effect of caffeine plus carbohydrate.",

J Strength Cond Res 36(7): 1916-1921, 2022-A carbohydrate mouth rinse (CMR) has been shown to enhance short duration endurance performance and raises the possibility that a similar strategy could improve performance during resistance exercise. Eighteen male and female (N = 36) resistance trained subjects (mean values ± SD; age: 21.5 ± 1.6 years, height: 1.72 ± 0.09 m, body mass: 72.8 ± 13.4 kg, and body fat: 16.7 ± 5.8%) performed 3 experimental visits during which bench press resistance exercise (4 × 10 repetitions at 65% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM] with 120 seconds recovery) and repetitions to failure at 60% 1RM were performed. Subjects rinsed 25 ml of water (WAT), noncaloric placebo (PLA), or 6.4% maltodextrin (CHO) solution for 10 seconds during exercise in a crossover, counter-balanced manner. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), pleasure-displeasure (FS), number of repetitions to fatigue (REPS), and postexercise blood glucose (GLU) and lactate (LA) were measured. Compared to WAT (17.7 ± 0.8), PLA (19.0 ± 0.7; p = 0.025), and CHO (18.7 ± 0.8; p = 0.039) treatments resulted in higher REPS, with no difference between PLA and CHO treatments (p = 0.310). Rating of perceived exertion progressively increased each set (p < 0.0001), but was not affected by treatment (p = 0.897). Pleasure-displeasure declined during recovery from sets 3 and 4 (p < 0.05) but was also not affected by treatment (p = 0.692). Postexercise GLU (p = 0.103) and LA (p = 0.620) were not different between treatments. Although a placebo effect was present for REPS, this study failed to detect an effect of CMR on REPS, RPE, FS, GLU, or LA on upper-body resistance exercise.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate (CHO) mouth rinse has been used as an ergogenic strategy due to its central effect; however, the effects of this intervention during short-duration high-intensity exercises are not fully understood. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of CHO mouth rinse on time to exhaustion in a short-duration high-intensity exercise performed on a treadmill. METHODS: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted with 10 (24.1 [4.3] y) recreationally active male runners. The protocol consisted of a warm-up at 65% of VO2max for 5 min followed by 3 min passive rest. At the end of this rest period, the individuals performed their mouth rinse either with CHO (maltodextrin, 6%) or with placebo (industrialized noncaloric juice with the same taste). Immediately after mouth rinse, the subjects ran at velocity equivalent to 100% of individual VO2max until voluntary exhaustion. The perceived effort was obtained through a Borg scale. Blood lactate was quantified before and after the protocol, and heart rate was evaluated during the protocol. RESULTS: No difference was found (P = .90) in time to exhaustion between placebo (193.9 [46.5] s) and CHO mouth rinse (195.1 [51.8] s). Blood lactate, heart rate, and perception of effort increased in both groups, but with no differences (all variables, P > .05) between groups. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that a preexercise single-CHO mouth rinse was ineffective to improve running time to exhaustion at velocity equivalent to 100% VO2max on a treadmill in recreationally active male runners."

      "abstract": "Multiple investigations have confirmed carbohydrate mouth rinse (CMR) enhances high intensity endurance performance lasting under 1 hour, but the effects of CMR on high intensity intermittent exercise has received less attention. This study examined the effect of CMR on high intensity multiple sprint performances in a protocol designed to emulate a cyclocross or mountain biking event. Seven trained men (28.2 ± 6.8 years, 185 ± 9 cm, 85.3 ± 14.8 kg, VO2peak 51.4 ± 7.3 ml/kg*min-1) completed two, 48 min high intensity intermittent cycling protocols that consisted of 6 bouts of 5 min cycling at 50% VO2 peak followed by sets of three, 10-s Wingate sprints with 50 s of recovery between sprints. Prior to each set of Wingate sprints, either a 6.4% carbohydrate solution (CMR) or placebo (PLA) were rinsed for 10 s using a counterbalanced crossover design. There was a significant main effect (CMR 10.51 ± 0.82, PLA 10.33 ± 0.87 W/kg; p < 0.05 ES=0.21) for mean power, but post hoc tests only revealed statistically significant performance improvement with CMR during the 6th bout (CMR 10.5 ± 0.75, PLA 10.22 ± 0.92 W/kg; p = 0.01 ES=0.33). No treatment effect was exhibited for peak power, fatigue index, ratings of perceived exertion, or blood glucose. Most team sport situations provide multiple opportunities for access to beverages, but gastrointestinal distress associated with fluid intake may reduce desire for significant beverage consumption. Under such circumstances, a small but practical ergogenic advantage may be exhibited if the fluid rinsed in the mouth contains carbohydrates."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CMR in athletes fed state on performance, biochemical and psychophysiological responses compared to ad libitum water intake. METHODS: Eleven trained male cyclists completed a randomized, crossover trial, which consisted of a 30 km cycle ergometer at self-selected intensity and in a fed state. Subjects were under random influence of the following interventions: CMR with a 6% unflavored maltodextrin solution; mouth rinsing with a placebo solution (PMR); drinking \"ad libitum\" (DAL). The time for completion of the test (min), heart rate (bpm) and power (watts), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), affective response, blood glucose (mg/dL) and lactate (mmol/DL), were evaluated before, during and immediately after the test, while insulin (uIL/mL), cortisol (μg/dL) and creatine kinase (U/L) levels were measured before, immediately after the test and 30 min after the test. RESULTS: Time for completion of the 30 km trial did not differ significantly among CMR, PMR and DAL interventions (means = 54.5 ± 2.9, 54.7 ± 2.9 and 54.5 ± 2.5 min, respectively; p = 0.82). RPE and affective response were higher in DAL intervention (p < 0.01). Glucose, insulin, cortisol and creatine kinase responses showed no significant difference among interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In a fed state, CMR has not caused metabolic changes, and it has not improved physical performance compared to ad libitum water intake, but demonstrated a possible central effect.

J Strength Cond Res 31(7): 1948-1953, 2017-Carbohydrate (CHO) mouth rinsing rapidly increases corticomotor output and maximal muscle force production, which could enhance muscular strength and endurance during resistance exercise. However, previous research has found no effect of CHO rinsing on muscular strength or endurance. The current study altered the CHO rinse composition and frequency and the muscular endurance test to further investigate the effects of a CHO mouth rinse on upper-body muscular strength and endurance. Twelve recreationally resistance-trained men (mean ± SD age 22 ± 1 year, height 179.2 ± 1.8 cm, body mass 80.9 ± 6.1 kg) completed a bench press protocol (1 repetition maximum [RM] test followed by repetitions to failure at 40% of 1RM) on 3 occasions. Subjects rinsed 25 ml of an 18% CHO solution or a placebo for 10 seconds before 1RM and repetitions to failure and completed a no-rinse control condition. Felt arousal (FA) was measured before and after each rinse, heart rate (HR) was measured before and after both exercise protocols, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded after repetitions to failure. Rinsing did not influence 1RM (p = 0.680, (Equation is included in full-text article.)= 0.03), repetitions to failure (p = 0.677, (Equation is included in full-text article.)= 0.04), or exercise volume (load × reps; p = 0.600, (Equation is included in full-text article.)= 0.05). There were no significant treatment effects on heart rate (p = 0.677, (Equation is included in full-text article.)= 0.04), FA (p = 0.674, (Equation is included in full-text article.)= 0.04) or rating of perceived exertion (p = 0.604, (Equation is included in full-text article.)= 0.05). A CHO mouth rinse does not improve upper-body muscular strength or endurance.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine to the influence of carbohydrate ingestion (CHOI) and carbohydrate mouth rinse (CHOR) on acute repeat maximal sprint performance. Fourteen healthy males (age: 21.7 ± 1.8 years, mass: 82.3 ± 12.3 kg) completed a total of five 15-s maximal repeat sprints on a cycle ergometer against 0.075 kg ・ kg-1 body mass each separated by 4 min of active recovery. Subjects completed four experimental trials and were randomly assigned one of four treatments: (1) CHOI, (2) CHOR, (3) placebo mouth rinse (PLAR), (4) placebo ingestion (PLAI). Subjects rinsed or ingested six 50 mL 10% CHO solutions throughout each trial. Performance variables measured included rating of perceived exertion, peak heart rate, peak and mean power output, fatigue index, and total work. Significant treatment main effects were observed for mean power output (p = 0.026), total work (p = 0.020), fatigue index (p = 0.004), and heart rate (p = 0.013). Overall mean power output and total work were significantly greater with CHOI (659.3 ± 103.0 watts, 9849.8 ± 1598.8 joules) compared with CHOR (645.8 ± 99.7 watts, 9447.5 ± 1684.9 joules, p < .05). CHOI (15.3 ± 8.6 watts/s) significantly attenuated fatigue index compared with CHOR (17.7 ± 10.4 watts/s, p < .05). Based on our findings, CHOI was more likely to provide a beneficial performance effect compared with CHOR, PLAI, and PLAR. Athletes required to complete repeat bouts of high intensity exercise may benefit from CHOI.",
