      "abstract": "Acute stress can cause emotional dysregulation and trigger various molecular changes, including increased neuroinflammation in limbic regions. These changes have the potential to induce anxiety by disrupting brain physiology and functional connectivity. In this study, we investigated whether an 8-day treatment with inflammation-resolving compounds, specifically Resolvin D5 (RvD5) and its precursor, the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), could alleviate anxiety induced by acute restraint stress (ARS) in male and female rats. Additionally, we assessed whether these effects persisted one week after treatment cessation. Serum corticosterone levels and proinflammatory cytokine levels in the hippocampus (HIP) were also assessed. Our results confirmed that ARS induced significant anxiety-like behavior in both the short and long term, with females displaying greater exploratory activity than males. Both RvD5 and DHA prevented the development of pronounced anxiety-like behavior in stressed rats, without affecting anxiety levels in non-stressed rats. Notably, the effect persisted for at least one-week post-treatment in females. The treatments also prevented the elevation of TNF alpha and interleukin-1 beta levels in the HIP and serum corticosterone levels in stressed animals. In conclusion, our findings confirm the neuroprotective profile of these compounds and indicate that the continuous use of DHA or RvD5 may have promising effects in preventing anxiety responses triggered by acute stressful event, regardless of sex. Furthermore, this study is the first to demonstrate that RvD5 can downregulate corticosterone levels in stressed animals."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Emerging resistance to Lenvatinib, which is used as a first-line agent for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is still a concern. The aim of this study was to determine core factors of Lenvatinib resistance (LR) and their underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: CRISPR screening in HCC cells was conducted, which identified E3 ubiquitin ligase deltex 2 (DTX2) as a core LR-related gene. In vivo and in vitro models were used to clarify the function of DTX2 on LR and ferroptosis. The upstream regulators and downstream effectors of DTX2 were identified, revealing its complex regulatory network. RESULTS: DTX2 promoted anti-ferroptosis in LR HCC cells via downregulating the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzyme HSD17B4. DTX2 induced the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of HSD17B4, resulting in lipid metabolism changes that were associated mainly with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing PUFAs. Notably, DHA supplements could reverse DTX2-induced anti-ferroptosis and LR. Mechanistically, we uncovered that DTX2 ubiquitinated the HSD17B4 SCP structural domain through its RING structural domain and ubiquitinated the K645 site. The upregulation of DTX2 expression was mediated by JAK2-STAT3 pathway activation. The aberrant activation of STAT3 in acquired LR promoted DTX2 transcription and negatively regulated peroxisomal β-oxidation via K48-ubiquitinated HSD17B4 and decreased DHA-phospholipids levels, leading to the suppression of Lenvatinib-induced ferroptosis in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that DTX2 attenuates Lenvatinib-induced ferroptosis by inhibiting DHA biosynthesis through HSD17B4-dependent peroxisomal β-oxidation in HCC. The combination of DHA with Lenvatinib could be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with LR HCC."

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to evaluate effects of MCT and DHA supplementation, alone or in combination, on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. METHODS: A total of 280 MCI participants were randomly assigned to the placebo group, MCT group (14 g/d octanoic acid+10 g/d capric acid), DHA group (800 mg/d) and MCT + DHA (14 g/d octanoic acid, 10 g/d capric acid and 800 mg/d DHA) group, 70 individuals per group for 12 months. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months; blood indicators were analyzed at baseline and 12 months. This study is registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200059641). RESULTS: After 12 months intervention, compared with the placebo group, MCT group, DHA group and MCT + DHA group had statistically significant improvements in full scale IQ (β: 0.107, 95 % CI: 0.006, 0.208; β: 0.135, 95 % CI: 0.034, 0.235; β: 0.136, 95 % CI: 0.035, 0.237), serum total ketone body levels (β: 10.540, 95 % CI: 9.550, 11.531; β: 5.884, 95 % CI: 4.894, 6.875; β: 13.186, 95 % CI: 12.196, 14.176), and decreases in mtDNA deletions (β: -0.370, 95 % CI: -0.648, -0.092; β: -0.335, 95 % CI: -0.613, -0.056; β: -0.427, 95 % CI: -0.705, -0.148) and plasma Aβ42 levels (β: -3.318, 95 % CI: -5.571, -1.064; β: -3.218, 95 % CI: -5.472, -0.965; β: -2.906, 95 % CI: -5.160, -0.653). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of MCT, DHA and their combination for 12 months can significantly improve cognitive function, mitochondria function and increase serum total ketone body levels in MCI individuals. Combined intervention was more beneficial than MCT or DHA alone.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is a genetically diverse, highly metastatic pediatric cancer accounting for 15% of childhood cancer deaths despite only having ~8% of childhood cancer incidence. The current standard of care for high-risk diseases is highly genotoxic. This, combined with less than 50% survival in high-risk diseases and an abysmal 5% survival in relapsed cases, makes discovering novel, effective, and less toxic treatments essential. Methods: A prophylactic syngeneic mouse model was used to test high-dose lipid-mediator highly unsaturated fatty acids on tumorigenesis. Wildtype mice were gavaged with 12.3-14.6 g/d (adult human equivalent) omega-3 EPA, DHA, or oxidation-resistant bis allylic deuterated DHA (D-DHA) and 4.6-6.0 g/d arachidonic acid (ARA). At seven days, MYCN-expressing murine neuro-2a cells syngeneic to the gavaged mice were injected subcutaneously. Oral gavage continued for 10-20 d post-injection when tumors and tissues were harvested. Results: Fifty percent of control (not gavaged) animals form tumors (4/8) at about 10 d. High-dose DHA, D-DHA, and EPA block tumor formation completely in n = 8 or 10 animals. In contrast, ω6 arachidonic acid (4.6-6.0 g/d) enhances tumor formation (6/10 tumors) and reduces latency (5.5 to 10 days) compared to the control. The co-delivery of ARA and EPA results in a reduced tumor burden analogous to the control group, suggesting that EPA directly opposes the mechanism of ARA-mediated tumor formation. DHA acts through a non-oxidative mechanism. Conclusions: Sustained high-dose ω3 (weeks/months) is safe and well-tolerated in humans. These results suggest that ω3 DHA and EPA delivery at ultra-high doses may represent a viable low-toxicity therapy for neuroblastoma."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) is an extensively used nutrition supplement in dairy food because of its beneficial effects on cognition. To find an effective DHA intervention for the synapses in the cortex during this period, this study aimed to use targeted lipidomics to evaluate the lipid composition of prefrontal-cortex (PFC) tissue in different DHA interference methods. METHODS: Analyzed samples were taken from interfering feeding Bama pigs (BPs) (3 months) fed with soybean oil (Group B), blended oil (Group M), naturally DHA-supplemented milk with blended oil (Group OM), and DHA from fish oil (FO) with blended oil (Group Y). We also examined the protein expression levels of BDNF, GAP43, and MBP. RESULTS: The lipidomics analysis identified 80 different related negative-ion lipid content and filtered the biomarker lipids in PFC tissue. We observed significant lipid composition changes between group Y and other groups, especially for content levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sphingomyelin (SM). The same observations were made from mRNA and protein expressions related to lipid transportation, phosphatidylserine (PS) synthetase, and synaptic plasticity in PFC tissues between group Y and other groups, including the mRNA expression levels of CD36, BDNF, and PTDSS1. The analysis of protein expression levels showed that the metabolism mode of DHA intervention from FO benefited the PFC, PS metabolism, and PFC synaptic plasticity of infants. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight further prospects for the DHA intervention mode, which provides new routes for other studies on polyunsaturated-fatty-acid (PUFA) interference for infants.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic allergic respiratory disease lacking effective therapies. The present study investigated the anti‑asthmatic properties of lipid mediators using an ovalbumin (OVA)‑induced allergic asthma model. Lipid mediators (LM; 17S‑monohydroxy docosahexaenoic acid, resolvin D5 and protectin DX at a ratio of 3:47:50) were derived from docosahexaenoic acid through soybean lipoxygenase. LM treatment significantly alleviated major features of allergic asthma, including inflammatory cell infiltration, with a particular reduction in eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, downregulation of Th2 cytokine expression, attenuation of airway remodeling, and oxidative stress, thereby closely resembling the normal condition. Additionally, a significant increase in the serum levels of interleukin‑6 [167.12±6.25 pg/ml; P<0.0001 vs. negative control (NC) group], tumor necrosis factor‑α (109.17±7.17 pg/ml; P<0.0001 vs. NC group) and IgE (90.24±5.98 ng/ml; P<0.0001 vs. NC group) was observed following OVA challenge; however, oral administration of LM resulted in a notable reduction in these levels to 99.45±6.12 pg/ml (P<0.001 vs. OVA group), 62.51±4.03 pg/ml (P<0.001 vs. OVA group) and 56.50±2.70 ng/ml (P<0.001 vs. OVA group), respectively. Furthermore, the heightened expression of Th2‑related cytokines induced by OVA was observed to be restored closely to normal conditions following LM treatment, as demonstrated for both gene and protein expression levels. Histological analysis demonstrated that LM mitigated inflammatory cell infiltration while reducing mucus secretion. Additionally, LM effectively ameliorated oxidative stress in OVA‑induced asthma, with a significant increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase (~185% vs. OVA group; P<0.001), elevated levels of glutathione (~74% higher than the OVA group; P<0.001) and reduced content of malondialdehyde (~40% lower than the OVA group; P<0.001) in lung tissues. Collectively, these findings suggested that LM effectively protected lung tissues from inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby representing a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of allergic asthma.",

      "abstract": "Background: Polyunsaturated fatty acids in particular omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential nutrients and components of the plasma membrane. They are involved in various processes, including synaptic development, functionality, integrity, and plasticity, and are therefore thought to have general neuroprotective properties. Considerable research evidence further supports the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids, specifically on mitochondria, through their antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, making them an attractive addition in treatment options for neurodegenerative disorders in which mitochondrial alterations are commonly observed. However, precise information on the underlying protective mechanisms is still lacking. Methods: We utilized the most common neuronal cell line (SH-SY5Y) and induced mitochondrial oxidative stress through the addition of rotenone. To study the potential protective effect of DHA, the cells were additionally pre-treated with DHA prior to rotenone administration. By combining SILAC labeling, mitochondria enrichment, and subsequent proteomic analyses, we aimed to determine the capacity of DHA to alleviate mitochondrial oxidative stress in vitro and further shed light on the molecular mechanisms contributing to the proposed neuroprotective effect. Results: We confirmed a reduced cell viability and an increased abundance of reactive oxygen species upon rotenone treatment, DHA pre-treatment was shown to decrease said species. Additionally proteomic analysis revealed an increased expression of mitochondrial proteins in DHA pre-treated cells. Conclusions: With our study, we were able to define a potential compensatory mechanism by which the inhibition of complex I is overcome by an increased activity of the fatty acid beta oxidation in response to DHA."

In total, 105 healthy pigmented guinea pigs aged 2 weeks were selected and randomly divided into five groups. The normal control (NC) group received no treatment, while the experimental groups wore -6.0D lenses on the right eye to establish an animal model of lens-induced myopia (LIM). These groups were further divided based on different treatments: normal feeding, DHA treatment, BE treatment, and combined DHA + BE treatment. Refractive error and axial length for both eyes were measured before modeling, after 4 weeks of modeling, and after 8 weeks of treatment. Fundus examination was performed, and choroidal thickness, choroidal vascularity index (CVI), maximal mixed response in dark adaptation (Max-ERG), and cone cell response in light adaptation (Cone-ERG) were measured. After 8 weeks of treatment, we observed a significant reduction in refractive error and shortening of axial length, improvement in fundus condition, and increased choroidal thickness and CVI in the LIM + DHA + BE group. Electroretinogram (ERG) showed that the amplitudes of a-wave and b-wave were enhanced in both Max-ERG and Cone-ERG tests. The LIM + DHA + BE group exhibited superior effects compared to the LIM + DHA group and the LIM + BE group. The combination of DHA and BE delayed the progression of LIM in guinea pigs and was more effective than DHA or BE alone. The synergistic effect of DHA and BE offers a new approach to the prevention and treatment of myopia."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The retina contains the highest concentration of the omega 3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the body. Although epidemiologic studies showed an inverse correlation between the consumption of omega 3 fatty acids and the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, there are no data showing the effect of diabetes on retinal DHA in humans. In this study, we measured the DHA content of the retina in diabetic and non-diabetic humans as well as mice and determined the effect of diabetes on retinal thickness and function in mice. METHODS: Fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Retinal thickness in mice was measured by optical coherence tomography and retinal function was measured by electroretinogram (ERG). Expression of selected genes involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: We found a 40% reduction of DHA in peripheral retina and a 25% reduction in the macula of diabetic humans compared with nondiabetic controls. There was a 24% reduction in retinal DHA of type 2 diabetic mice (db/db) compared with the controls (db/+). The retinal thickness was significantly decreased in db/db mice, especially in the inner retina, and the ERG b-wave amplitudes were significantly attenuated. Increased expression of proinflammatory genes was observed in both human and mouse diabetic retinas. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal DHA is reduced in diabetic humans and mice, which is associated with a thinning of retina and functional defects in diabetic mice. Enriching retinal DHA through diet may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.",

As the severity of epidural adhesion is positively correlated with the inflammatory response, implanting a fibrous membrane after spinal surgery, which can act as a physical barrier to prevent adhesion formation while simultaneously modulates postoperative inflammation, is a promising approach to meet clinical needs. Toward this end, we fabricated an electrospun core-shell fibrous membrane (CSFM) based on polylactic acid (PLA) and infused the fiber core region with the potent natural anti-inflammatory compound docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The PLA/DHA CSFM can continuously deliver DHA for up to 36 days in vitro and reduce the penetration and attachment of fibroblasts. The released DHA can downregulate the gene expression of inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in fibroblasts. Following an in vivo study that implanted a CSFM in rats subjected to lumbar laminectomy, the von Frey withdrawal test indicates the PLA/DHA CSFM treatment can successfully alleviate neuropathic pain-like behaviors in the treated rats, showing 3.60 ± 0.49 g threshold weight in comparison with 1.80 ± 0.75 g for the PLA CSFM treatment and 0.57 ± 0.37 g for the untreated control on day 21 post-implantation. The histological analysis also indicates that the PLA/DHA CSFM can significantly reduce proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) protein expression at the lesion and provide anti-adhesion effects, indicating its vital role in preventing epidural fibrosis by mitigating the inflammatory response.",

Despite the primary cause of these diseases being inherently genetic, their development can be delayed with proper preventive treatments. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 LCPUFA) are promising bioactive nutrients that are beneficial for brain health. In this study, the impact of an oil rich in a structured form of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) triglyceride (TG) was assessed in a Caenorhabditis elegans model expressing long poly-glutamine (polyQ) chains, which mimics the symptomatology of polyQ-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), among others. The lifespan, the motility, the number of polyQ aggregates, the oxidative stress resistance, and the cognitive performance associated with sensitive stimuli was measured in mutant nematodes with polyQ aggregates. Overall, DHA-TG at 0.5 µM improved the lifespan, the motility, the oxidative stress resistance, and the cognitive performance of the nematodes, emphasizing the protection against serotonergic synapse dysfunction. Furthermore, the treatment reduced the polyQ aggregates in the nematodes. The data described herein shed light on the connection between DHA and the cognitive performance in neurodegenerative diseases and demonstrated the potential of DHA-TG as nutritional co-adjuvant to prevent the development of polyQ-associated dysfunctions.",

OBJECTIVES: To identify and validate specific PUFAs that can influence the timing of menarche and menopause in women. METHODS: We utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to evaluate the causal relationships between various PUFAs and female reproductive longevity, defined by age at menarche (AAM) and age at natural menopause (ANM). Our analyses leveraged summary statistics from four genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on the plasma concentrations of 10 plasma PUFAs, including 8866 to 121,633 European individuals and 1361 East Asian individuals. Large-scale GWASs for reproductive traits provided the genetic data of AAM and ANM from over 202,323 European females and 43,861 East Asian females. Causal effects were estimated by beta coefficients, representing, for each increase in the standard deviation (SD) of plasma PUFA concentration, the yearly increase in AAM or ANM. Replications, meta-analyses, and cross-ancestry effects were assessed to validate the inference. CONCLUSIONS: Higher plasma DHA was identified to be associated with delayed natural menopause without affecting menarche, offering a potential intervention target for extending reproductive longevity.",

      "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid with promising anticancer potential. Anaemia is a frequent adverse effect of anticancer treatment caused in part by eryptosis and haemolysis. Thus, it is important to investigate the role of DHA in red blood cell (RBC) death. RBCs were treated with anticancer concentrations (10-100 μM) of DHA under different physiological conditions, and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting was employed to measure eryptotic markers. Cell membrane scrambling was detected by annexin-V-FITC labelling, cytoplasmic Ca2+ by Fluo4/AM, cell size by forward scatter (FSC), and oxidative stress by H2DCFDA. Haemolytic markers were also assayed by photometric methods. DHA caused significant phospholipid scrambling with Ca2+ accumulation, loss of cellular volume, and oxidative stress. These changes were associated with dacrocyte formation, as revealed by electron microscopy. Moreover, DHA exhibited a dual effect on membrane integrity: it was haemolytic under isotonic conditions and anti-haemolytic in hypotonic environments. Importantly, inhibition of Rac1 GTPase activity with NSC23766 significantly reduced DHA-mediated haemolysis, as did co-administration of either sucrose or polyethylene glycol 8,000. Conversely, the presence of 125 mM KCl and urea without extracellular Ca2+ significantly exacerbated DHA toxicity. In conclusion, this is the first report that identifies key biochemical mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of DHA in RBCs, promoting further development and validation of DHA in anticancer therapy.",

We hypothesize that the accumulation of LPC n-3 in the brain is lower in mice carrying the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor for developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease in humans. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether two or four months of supplementation with LPC n-3 increases the levels of docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) in the frontal cortex of APOE3 and APOE4 mice. METHODS: APOE3 and APOE4 mice were administered LPC n-3 (9.6 mg DHA + 18.3 mg EPA) or sunflower oil (control) by oral gavage for two or four months (n = 5-8 per genotype, per treatment, and per treatment duration). At the end of the treatment period, frontal cortices were collected, and their FA profiles analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. RESULTS: After two months of gavage with LPC n-3, APOE3 mice showed increased levels of EPA in their cortex, but not DHA. In APOE4 mice, neither EPA nor DHA levels were significantly affected. After four months of LPC n-3, both APOE3 and APOE4 mice exhibited higher EPA levels, while changes in DHA levels were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: LPC n-3 supplementation increased EPA, but not DHA, levels in the frontal cortex of mice in a duration- and APOE genotype-dependent manner. Further research is needed to explore the implications for brain health.",

DHA was administered to mice and its effects on stroke outcomes in type 1 diabetes mellitus were assessed 24 h and 3 days post-reperfusion using RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, multiplex immunoassays, and western-blotting analysis. In diabetic mice, DHA administration post-ischemic stroke significantly reduced cerebral infarct size, brain edema, and neurological impairments. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a notable decrease in the percentage of neutrophils in the ischemic brain, suggesting a mitigated inflammatory response. Western blotting assay revealed that pro-apoptotic protein Bax was reduced whereas anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased, indicating the attenuation of apoptosis. Additionally, RNA sequencing of brain tissue highlighted significant transcriptomic changes, with downregulation of genes for several inflammatory pathways such as NF-kappa B signaling and upregulation of genes for neuroprotective pathways such as neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Similar transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated that DHA treatment resulted the systemic anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective response. DHA treatment mitigated cerebral ischemic injuries by dampening inflammatory responses and apoptosis in diabetic mice after ischemic stroke, highlighting its therapeutic potential for clinical management of stroke in diabetic patients.",

However, it remains unclear whether the improvement is related to the alterations of gut microbiota and inflammation and the impact of the combined intervention. In this study, we hypothesized that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could modulate gut microbiota, inflammation, and improve cognitive function in APPswe/PS1De9 model mice and senescence-accelerated mouse-prone-8, which are two different mouse models used in neurodegeneration research. The mice were divided into four groups: Control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. The study assessed cognitive function, inflammatory cytokines, and gut microbiota composition. The results showed that supplementation of MCTs + DHA improved spatial learning ability, memory capacity, exploratory behavior; decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria; reduced the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes; decreased the concentrations of serum interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while increasing the concentration of IL-10. Furthermore, supplementation with MCTs + DHA exhibited significantly superior effects compared to MCTs or DHA alone in reducing inflammation, optimizing gut microbiota composition, and improving cognitive function. In conclusion, supplementation with MCTs + DHA improved cognition function, accompanied with favorable alterations in gut microbiota and inflammation in APPswe/PS1De9 and senescence-accelerated mouse-prone-8 mice.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the impact of this supplementation on intestinal fatty acid composition, structure, and indicators that are supportive of OT development. METHODS: Allergy-prone Brown Norway dams were randomly assigned to a control (0% ARA, 0% DHA) or ARA + DHA diet (0.45% ARA, 0.8% DHA) during suckling (0-3 wk). At weaning (3-8 wk), offspring were randomly assigned to a control (0% ARA, 0% DHA) or ARA + DHA diet (0.5% ARA, 0.5% DHA). At 3 wk, offspring in each group received an oral gavage of sucrose or ovalbumin (OVA) solution for five consecutive days. At 7 wk, all offspring received an intraperitoneal OVA injection. At 8 wk, offspring were terminated to evaluate jejunum morphology and measure mucosal food allergy-related secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and cytokines, ileum phospholipid and triglyceride fatty acid compositions, and fecal calprotectin. RESULTS: Weaning ARA + DHA resulted in a higher percentage of DHA in ileum phospholipids and triglycerides (both P < 0.001), without affecting the percentage of ARA. Despite no lasting effect of suckling ARA + DHA on the DHA content in ileum phospholipids, a programming effect was found on the allergy-related intestinal immune profile [higher concentrations of mucosal IL-2 (P = 0.049) and sIgA (P = 0.033)]. OVA treatment resulted in a lower concentration of mucosal IL-6 (P = 0.026) regardless of dietary interventions. Offspring fed ARA + DHA during suckling and/or weaning had a higher concentration of mucosal transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) after OVA treatment but this was not observed in offspring fed control diets during suckling and weaning (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Early life dietary ARA + DHA supplementation to allergy-prone rats enhanced the DHA concentration in intestinal phospholipids (weaning period) and increased the mucosal sIgA, IL-2, and TGF-β levels (suckling and weaning period), indicating its ability to create a tolerogenic intestinal environment to support OT development.",

Our objective was to determine whether high-dose DHA supplementation during the neonatal period, vs. placebo, improves behavioral functioning at 5 years in children born very preterm. METHODS: This is a follow-up at 5 years corrected age of a subset of children who participated in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. The participants received a high-dose DHA supplementation, or a placebo, through maternal breastmilk until 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Primary outcome was child behavioral functioning, assessed by the Total Difficulties Score from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Secondary outcomes included behavioral scores from the SDQ, executive functions assessment and global developmental performance. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed through interviews with parents. Mean differences between DHA and placebo groups were estimated using mixed linear models. Subgroup analyses were conducted for sex and gestational age (GA) at birth. RESULTS: Among 177 eligible children, 132 (74.6 %) completed neurodevelopmental assessment at 5 years (DHA, N = 64, placebo, N = 68). Total Difficulties Score did not differ between the DHA and placebo groups (mean differences, -0.9 [95 % confidence interval, -2.7 to 0.8], P = 0.30), nor any of the secondary outcomes. There was no significant interaction between treatment groups and sex, nor GA, for the primary outcome. However, significant interactions between treatment groups and sex or GA were found for some secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In very preterm infants, high-dose DHA supplementation did not improve behavioral functioning at 5 years.

This review aims to summarize the current literature on the mediating effects of DHA on brain and gut microbiome development and attempts to reevaluate the efficacy of DHA from a gut microbiome-mediated perspective. Specifically, the regulatory roles of DHA on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammation, and neuroactive mediators may be partly moderated through gut microbiome.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chicken may be enriched with 25-hydroxy D3 [25(OH)D3] and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to enhance the dietary intake of the public. OBJECTIVES: Two experiments (Expt.) were conducted to determine the potential and metabolic impacts of enriching both DHA and 25(OH)D3 in the tissues of broiler chickens. METHODS: In Expt. 1, 144 chicks (6 cages/treatment and 6 birds/cage) were fed a corn-soybean meal basal diet (BD), BD + 10,000 IU 25(OH)D3/kg [BD + 25(OH)D3], BD + 1% DHA-rich Aurantiochytrium (1.2 g DHA/kg; BD + DHA), or BD + 25(OH)D3+DHA for 6 wk. In Expt. 2, 180 chicks were fed the BD, BD + DHA-rich microalgal oil (1.5-3.0 g DHA/kg, BD + DHA), BD + DHA + eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich microalgae (0.3-0.6 g EPA/kg, BD + DHA + EPA), BD + DHA + 25(OH)D3 [6000 to 12,000 IU/kg diet; BD + DHA + 25(OH)D3], and BD + DHA + EPA + 25(OH)D3 for 6 wk. RESULTS: Supranutrition of these 2 nutrients resulted in 57-62 mg DHA and 1.9-3.3 μg of 25(OH)D3/100 g of breast or thigh muscles. The DHA enrichment was independent of dietary EPA or 25(OH)D3, but that of 25(OH)D3 in the liver was decreased (68%, P < 0.05) by dietary DHA in Expt. 1. Compared with BD, BD + 25(OH)D3 enhanced (P < 0.05) gene expression related to D3 absorption (scavenger receptor class B type 1 and Niemann-pick c1 like 1) in the liver and D3 degradation (cytochrome P450 24A1) in the breast, and decreased mRNA or protein concentrations of vitamin D binding protein in the adipose tissue or thigh muscle. Supranutrition of DHA decreased mRNA concentrations of lipid metabolism-related genes (fatty acid desaturase 1,2, ELOVL fatty acid elongase 5, fatty acid desaturase 2, fatty acid synthase, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1). CONCLUSIONS: Both DHA and 25(OH)D3 were enriched in the muscles up to meeting 50%-100% of the suggested intakes of these nutrients by consuming 2 servings of 100 g of fortified chicken. The enrichments altered gene expression related to lipid biosynthesis and vitamin D transport or storage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intravenous lipid emulsions used in preterm infants contain insufficient docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) to support normal development, resulting in deficiencies that contribute to complications of prematurity and cognitive delay. We sought to investigate the effects of new intravenous lipid emulsions designed to contain sufficient DHA and ARA to meet preterm needs, while avoiding liver toxicity. METHODS: Three new lipid emulsions (NLE A-C) were laboratory-generated using high pressure homogenization. First, a long-term experiment evaluated the impact on plasma, liver, and frontal cortex fatty acid composition compared to commercially available lipid emulsions. Lipid emulsions were administered via daily orogastric gavage to four-week-old C57Bl/6 J mice. Next, liver toxicity was evaluated in a murine model of parenteral nutrition-induced hepatosteatosis. Mice were provided an ad lib fat-free high carbohydrate diet, with intravenous lipid emulsion administration every other day for 19 days. RESULTS: Administration of commercially available lipid emulsions (soybean oil, mixed oil, or fish oil) resulted in decreased plasma and tissue levels of DHA and/or ARA compared to a chow control. The new lipid emulsions demonstrated a dose-response effect in plasma and tissue concentration of DHA and ARA. NLE C (with an approximately even DHA:ARA ratio), compared to chow, maintained similar DHA (19.2 ± 0.3 vs. 19.3 ± 0.3%, P = 1.00) and ARA (10.4 ± 0.2 vs. 9.9 ± 0.2% ARA, P = 0.75) content in frontal cortex tissue. All three new lipid emulsions prevented biochemical liver injury and pathologist-assessed hepatosteatosis; soybean oil lipid emulsion and mixed oil lipid emulsion treatment resulted in hepatosteatosis in both experiments. CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with the new lipid emulsions in juvenile mice resulted in increased plasma and tissue DHA and/or ARA content compared to currently available lipid emulsions. The new lipid emulsions also prevented hepatosteatosis and biochemical liver injury with enteral and parenteral administration.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: The recent approval of enzalutamide for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer underscores its growing clinical significance, raising concerns about emerging resistance and limited treatment options. While the reactivation of the androgen receptor (AR) and other genes plays a role in enzalutamide resistance, identifications of novel underlying mechanism with therapeutic potential in enzalutamide-resistant (EnzaR) cells remain largely elusive. METHODS: Drug-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, animal models, and organoids were utilized to examine NUDT21 function by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses through loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays. Notably, a mono-methylation monoclonal antibody and conditional-knockin transgenic mouse model of NUDT21 were generated for evaluating its function. RESULTS: NUDT21 overexpression acts as a crucial alternative polyadenylation (APA) mediator, supported by its oncogenic role in prostate cancer. PRMT7-mediated mono-methylation of NUDT21 induces a shift in 3'UTR usage, reducing oncogenicity. In contrast, its un-methylation promotes cancer growth and cuproptosis insensitivity in EnzaR cells by exporting toxic copper and suppressing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) biosynthesis. Crucially, NUDT21 inhibition or DHA supplementation with copper ionophore holds therapeutic promise for EnzaR cells. CONCLUSIONS: The un-methylation of NUDT21-mediated 3'UTR shortening unveils a novel mechanism for enzalutamide resistance, and our findings offer innovative strategies for advancing the treatment of prostate cancer patients experiencing enzalutamide resistance.",

Here, we investigated the anti-diabetic properties of DHA in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (D2M) focusing on autophagy-controlling factors. METHODS: D2M was induced in male Wistar rats using a single dose of streptozocin (STZ) and a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. On week 2, diabetic rats received DHA 950 mg/kg/d until the end of the study. After that, rats were euthanized, and aortic and cardiac tissue samples were stained with H&E staining for histological assessment. The expression of adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, was measured in heart samples using real-time PCR analysis. Using western blotting, protein levels of BCLN1, LC3, and P62 were measured in D2M rats pre- and post-DHA treatment. RESULTS: Data showed intracellular lipid vacuoles inside the vascular cells, and cardiomyocytes, after induction of D2M and DHA reduced intracellular lipid droplets and in situ inflammatory response. DHA can diminish increased levels of ICAM-1 in diabetic conditions (P Control vs. D2M rats=0.005) and reach near-to-control values (P Control vs. D2M rats=0.28; P D2M rats vs. D2M rats+DHA=0.033). Based on western blotting, D2M slightly increased the BCLN1 and LC3-II/I ratio without affecting P62. DHA promoted the LC3II/I ratio (P=0.303) and reduced P62 (P Control vs. D2M rats+DHA =0.0433; P D2M vs. D2M rats+DHA=0.096), leading to the completion of autophagy flux under diabetic conditions. CONCLUSION: DHA can reduce lipotoxicity of cardiovascular cells possibly via the activation of adaptive autophagy response in D2D rats."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid. We investigated the dual health ability of DHA to modulate gut microbiota in children with obesity and to exert anti-inflammatory activity on human intestinal Caco-2 cells. METHODS: In a pilot study involving 18 obese children (8-14 years), participants received a daily DHA supplement (500 mg/day) and dietary intervention from baseline (T0) to 4 months (T1), followed by dietary intervention alone from 4 months (T1) to 8 months (T2). Fecal samples, anthropometry, biochemicals and dietary assessment were collected at each timepoint. At preclinical level, we evaluated DHA's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on Caco-2 cells stimulated with Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), by measuring also Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels and cytokines, respectively. RESULTS: Ten children were included in final analysis. No major changes were observed for anthropometric and biochemical parameters, and participants showed a low dietary compliance at T1 and T2. DHA supplementation restored the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio that was conserved also after the DHA discontinuation at T2. DHA supplementation drove a depletion in Ruminococcaceae and Dialisteraceae, and enrichment in Bacteroidaceae, Oscillospiraceae, and Akkermansiaceae. At genus level, Allisonella was the most decreased by DHA supplementation. In Caco-2 cells, DHA decreased H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production via iNOS pathway modulation. Additionally, DHA modulated proinflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine production in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells. CONCLUSION: An improvement in gut dysbiosis of children with obesity seems to be triggered by DHA and to continue after discontinuation. The ability to modulate gut microbiota, matches also with an anti-inflammatory effect of DHA on Caco-2 cells.",

      "abstract": "Autophagy induction in cancer is involved in cancer progression and the acquisition of resistance to anticancer agents. Therefore, autophagy is considered a potential therapeutic target in cancer therapy. In this study, we found that long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) have inhibitory effects on Atg4B, which is essential for autophagosome formation, through screening based on the pharmacophore of 21f, a recently developed Atg4B inhibitor. Among these fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, exhibited the most potent Atg4B inhibitory activity. DHA inhibited autophagy induced by androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) in LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells and significantly increased apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of DHA on resistance to ARSI by establishing darolutamide-resistant prostate cancer 22Rv1 (22Rv1/Dar) cells, which had developed resistance to darolutamide, a novel ARSI. At baseline, 22Rv1/Dar cells showed a higher autophagy level than parental 22Rv1 cells. DHA significantly suppressed Dar-induced autophagy and sensitized 22Rv1/Dar cells by inducing apoptotic cell death through mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest that DHA supplementation may improve prostate cancer therapy with ARSI.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic keratopathy, characterized by corneal structural changes, is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, has shown potential therapeutic benefits in various diabetic complications. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of DHA on corneal tissue in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 DM in rats. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10 per group): Control, DHA, DM, and DM + DHA. The DHA group received DHA by oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 10 days. In the DM group, diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ at 50 mg/kg. Confirmation of diabetes induction was based on monitoring fasting blood glucose levels on the third day post-injection. The DM + DHA group underwent the same diabetes induction protocol with STZ and received DHA at 100 mg/kg daily via oral gavage for 10 consecutive days. Corneal tissue samples were collected at the end of the study period for histopathological, immunohistochemical, qRT-PCR, and ELISA analyses. Histopathological analysis showed significant edema, angiogenesis, and degeneration in the DM group compared to the control (p < 0.001). DHA treatment significantly mitigated these changes, approaching control levels (p < 0.01). Immunohistochemistry showed increased VEGFR2 and iNOS expression in the DM group, which was significantly reduced in the DM + DHA group (p < 0.01). qRT-PCR results indicated a significant decrease in Bcl-2 expression (p < 0.001) and an increase in ATF-6, IRE1, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β, NLRP3, Bax, and Caspase-3 expressions in the DM group (p < 0.001). ELISA analyses revealed significantly elevated levels of inflammatory markers NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the DM group compared to the control (p < 0.001). DHA treatment significantly upregulated Bcl-2 and downregulated apoptotic and inflammatory markers (p < 0.01). DHA demonstrated significant protective effects against STZ-induced corneal damage in diabetic rats by modulating apoptotic and inflammatory pathways. These findings suggest that DHA may be a promising therapeutic agent for preventing diabetic keratopathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and linoleic acid (LA) have been shown to exhibit anti-proliferative effects against breast cancer cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet fully understood. One potential mechanism is through the regulation of microRNAs (miRs), which are known to play a crucial role in breast cancer development and progression. This study aimed to investigate the expression of miR-342 and miR-101 as tumor-suppressor miRs in the human HER-2 positive breast cancer cell line BT-474 after treatment with DHA, LA, alone or in combination with Taxol, a standard chemotherapy agent. METHODS: The human breast cancer cell line BT-474 was cultured, and the IC50 for Taxol was determined using the MTT assay. Cells were then cultured and treated for 24 h with 100 μM DHA and 50 μM LA, alone or in combination with the respective IC50 of Taxol. Cells were harvested, and miRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed using standard methods. Expression levels of miRs were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and results were normalized against U6 snRNA expression levels. RESULTS: The Taxol IC50 for BT-474 cells was 19 nM. According to the data obtained from our study, it was observed that Taxol treatment resulted in the down-regulation of both miR-101 and miR-342 (3.69 (p < 0.0001) and 1.88 fold, (p < 0.0001) respectively). In addition, DHA, LA and DHA + LA caused up-regulation of miR-101 (0.11, 0.05, 0.03 fold (p < 0.0001) respectively) but not miR-342 (decreased by 1.93 (p < 0.0001), 2.89 (p < 0.0001) and 1.19 fold (p = 0.0029) respectively). Notably, treatment with DHA, LA and DHA + LA was able to restore the down-regulated expression of miR-101 (0.25 (p < 0.0001), 0.05 (p = 0.0012) and 0.06 fold (p < 0.0001) respectively) during Taxol treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that DHA and LA can effectively compensate for the reduced expression of miR-101 during Taxol treatment. These findings suggest that dietary fatty acids may play a critical role in modulating the anti-cancer effects of chemotherapy agents. Future studies are needed to investigate the functional aspects of dietary fatty acids on breast cancer development and progression.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, characterized by limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Its aggressiveness is attributed not only to the uncontrolled proliferation and invasion of tumor cells but also to the complex interplay between these cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Within the tumor microenvironment, an intricate network of immune cells, stromal cells, and various signaling molecules creates a pro-inflammatory milieu that supports tumor growth and progression. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acid for brain function, is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties. Therefore, in this work, DHA liposomes were synthesized using a microfluidic platform to target and reduce the inflammatory environment of GBM. The liposomes were rapidly taken up by macrophages in a time-dependent manner without causing cytotoxicity. Moreover, DHA liposomes successfully downregulated the expression of inflammatory-associated genes (IL-6; IL-1β; TNFα; NF-κB, and STAT-1) and the secretion of key cytokines (IL-6 and TNFα) in stimulated macrophages and GBM cells. Conversely, no significant differences were observed in the expression of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory gene expressed in alternatively activated macrophages. Additionally, DHA liposomes were found to be more efficient in regulating the inflammatory profile of these cells compared with a free formulation of DHA. The nanomedicine platform established in this work opens new opportunities for developing liposomes incorporating DHA to target GBM and its inflammatory milieu.",

      "abstract": "Although supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during porcine oocyte IVM is well-established, the available data are limited due to the lack of consistency. Moreover, to our knowledge, the anti-oxidant effects of DHA on porcine oocytes have not been reported. Hence, this study aimed to examine the effects of DHA supplementation on the regulation of energy metabolism during porcine oocyte maturation to improve oocyte maturation and embryonic development. By supplementing the IVM medium with various DHA concentrations, 25 μM DHA was identified as the optimal concentration which improved intraoocyte glutathione content and enhanced embryonic development after parthenogenesis. Compared to embryos derived from the control group, those derived from SCNT or IVF showed significantly improved blastocyst formation upon DHA supplementation during IVM. In addition, various transcription factors associated with oocyte development and apoptosis in mature oocytes were beneficially regulated in the DHA-treated oocytes. Moreover, DHA improved the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-regulatory ability of porcine oocytes and ameliorated nuclear maturation and embryonic development, which were decreased by artificially downregulating AMPK. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of DHA as an AMPK regulator on oocyte maturation and embryo development in pigs. Furthermore, DHA addition to the IVM medium upregulated the relative expression of genes associated with mitochondrial potential and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the membrane potential of mitochondria (evaluated based on the JC-1 aggregate/JC-1 monomer ratio) and the levels of fatty acids and lipid droplets in matured oocytes increased, resulting in increased ATP synthesis. In conclusion, the DHA treatment of porcine oocytes with 25 μM DHA during IVM enhances the homeostasis of energy metabolism by improving mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, leading to improved quality of matured oocytes and enhanced embryonic developmental potential of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos. Thus, 25 μM DHA supplementation could serve as a tool for improving the quality of IVP embryos. The study findings provide a basis for further research on improving the production efficiency of cloned animals by securing high-quality matured oocytes and enhancing energy metabolism in mammalian oocytes, including those of pigs.",

      "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid monoacylglycerol represents a promising lipid constituent in the development of drug nanocarriers owing to its amphiphilicity and the beneficial health effects of this docosahexaenoic acid precursor in various disorders including cancer and inflammatory diseases. Here, we describe the formation and characterization of simple-by-design and stabilizer-free lamellar and non-lamellar crystalline nanoparticles (vesicles and cubosomes, respectively) from binary mixtures of docosahexaenoic acid monoacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, which is a ubiquitous amphiphilic component present in biological systems. At the physiological temperature of 37 °C, these single amphiphilic components tend to exhibit inverse hexagonal and lamellar liquid crystalline phases, respectively, on exposure to excess water. They can also be combined and dispersed in excess water by employing a high-energy emulsification method (by means of ultrasonication) to produce through an electrostatic stabilization mechanism colloidally stable nanodispersions. A colloidal transformation from vesicles to cubosomes was detected with increasing MAG-DHA content. Through use of synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis, we report on the structural and morphological features, and size characteristics of these nanodispersions. Depending on the lipid composition, their internal liquid crystalline architectures were spanning from a lamellar (Lα) phase to biphasic features of coexisting inverse bicontinuous (Q2) cubic Pn3m and Im3m phases. Thus, a direct colloidal vesicle-cubosome transformation was detected by augmenting the concentration of docosahexaenoic acid monoacylglycerol. The produced cubosomes were thermally stable within the investigated temperature range of 5-60 °C. Collectively, our findings contribute to understanding of the imperative steps for production of stabilizer-free cubosomes from biocompatible lipids through a simple-by-design approach. We also discuss the potential therapeutic use and future implications for development of next-generation of multifunctional vesicles and cubosomes for co-delivery of docosahexaenoic acid and drugs in treatment of diseases.",

METHODS: Adults with MASLD were randomised to one of four treatment arms (vitamin E 1000 mg/daily + DHA 1.89 g/daily or combination arm, vitamin E 1000 mg alone, DHA 1.89 g alone or placebo) following a 2:1:1:2 randomisation. The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of DHA + vitamin E versus placebo in reducing hepatic fat fraction (%) relative to baseline after 6 months of intervention. Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of vitamin E or DHA alone versus placebo on reducing liver fat at 6 months. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 203 subjects with a mean age of 51 years, 53% female, 91% White, 59% Hispanic ethnicity. The combination of vitamin E + DHA had no effect on the primary endpoint of reducing hepatic steatosis as determined by MRI-PDFF (p = 0.98). Neither vitamin E alone (p = 0.91) nor DHA alone (p = 0.14) significantly reduced hepatic steatosis compared to placebo. However, the trial was not powered adequately for this analysis. Compared with placebo, no statistically significant differences were detected in the 3-month or 6-month levels for ALT (U/L) or AST (U/L) in all three intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of DHA + vitamin E or either agent alone did not demonstrate efficacy on reducing liver fat or aminotransferases in the studied population.",

On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of nobiletin and DHA in combination on proinflammatory cytokine production was not synergistic. Neither nobiletin nor DHA affected the phagocytotic activity of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the inhibition potency of DHA on the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 and nuclear translocation of NF-κB is markedly enhanced by simultaneously treating with nobiletin, which may lead to the synergistic anti-inflammatory effect. Overall, our findings show the potential of the synergistic anti-inflammatory effect of nobiletin and DHA in combination.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: It is uncertain whether folic acid (FA) combined with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could improve cognitive performance. This study evaluated the effects of a 12-month FA and DHA supplementation, in combination or alone, on cognitive function, DNA oxidative damage, and mitochondrial function in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited MCI participants aged 60 years and older. Two hundred and eighty participants were randomly divided in equal proportion into four groups: FA + DHA (FA 800 μg/d + DHA 800 mg/d), FA (800 μg/d), DHA (800 mg/d), and placebo groups daily orally for 12 months. The primary outcome was cognitive function evaluated by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-RC). Cognitive tests and blood mechanism-related biomarkers were determined at baseline and 12 months. RESULTS: During the 12-month follow-up, scores of full intelligence quotient (βDHA: 1.302, 95% CI: 0.615, 1.990, p &lt; 0.001; βFA: 1.992, 95% CI: 1.304, 2.679, p &lt; 0.001; βFA+DHA: 2.777, 95% CI: 2.090, 3.465, p &lt; 0.001), verbal intelligence quotient, and some subtests of the WAIS-RC were significantly improved in FA + DHA and single intervention groups compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the FA and DHA intervention combination was superior to either intervention alone (p &lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, FA, DHA, and their combined use significantly decreased 8-OHdG level and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number compared to the placebo (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of FA and DHA, alone or combined, for 12 months can improve cognitive function in MCI participants, possibly through mitigating DNA oxidative damage and enhancing mitochondrial function. Combined supplementation may provide more cognitive benefit than supplementation alone.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate and analyze the effects of a flushing diet containing Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from Lemuru (Sardinella sp) fish oil on the reproductive performance parameters of Garut ewes. Forty (n = 40) primiparous Garut ewes aged 12-14 months with an average body weight of 28.92 ± 4.94 kg were assigned into four experimental treatment groups. The experimental diets contained roughage: concentrate (30:70%) designated as control concentrate (CNT), flushing concentrate with 6% palm oil (PO), flushing concentrate with 3% palm oil mixed with 3% lemuru oil as DHA and EPA sources (PFO), and flushing concentrate with the addition of 6% lemuru oil (FO). Treatment animals were fed two weeks before and after conception and parturition (8 weeks of total flushing treatment). The addition of fish oil at either 3% (PFO) or 6% (FO) resulted in significantly higher reproductive performance of ewes by increasing the litter size, as reflected by the birth of multiple kids (P < 0.05) compared to CNT and PO. Adding fish oil (PFO and FO) also maintains gestation, resulting in increased lamb yield, especially in the FO treatment, which yields the highest lamb yield (0% single lamb birth). The lamb male ratio was also higher with fish oil supplementation (PFO and PO) (P < 0.05). This research revealed a positive effect of 6% Lemuru oil on decreasing embryo loss and increasing the proportion of twin births. These findings thus support the hypothesis that ration flushing with double the required DHA and EPA from 6% Lemuru fish oil (FO) resulted in significantly higher reproductive performance in Garut sheep.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies of maternal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation during pregnancy have controversial and contrasting results on the short and long-term effects on early child growth. The impact of this nutritional intervention on the postnatal growth patterns in the offspring of women with pregestational overweight/obesity (PGO) also remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the postnatal growth patterns during the first 4 months of life in the offspring of women with PGO randomly supplemented with 800 mg/day (PGO-800) compared with normative doses of 200 mg/day (PGO-200) of DHA during pregnancy (<15 weeks of gestation until delivery). METHODS: This study evaluated the growth patterns during the first 4 months of life of 169 infants of the women that participated in the MIGHT study (NCT02574767). We included the infants of women from the PGO-200 (n = 81) and PGO-800 group (n = 88). The growth patterns (weight, length, and head circumference) and change in z-score (World health Organization charts) were evaluated. RESULTS: Throughout the first 4 months of life, the infants of the PGO-800 group had lower weight-for-length z-score (coef. -0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.07, -0.22, p = 0.003) and lower body mass index-for-age z-score (coef. -0.56, 95% CI -0.99, -0.12, p = 0.012) compared with the PGO-200 group adjusted by maternal body mass index, gestational weight gain, gestational age, insulin in cord blood and infant feeding (exclusive breastfed, not breastfed, and partially breastfed). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal supplementation with DHA during pregnancy could beneficially limit the offspring's postnatal weight gain during the first 4 months of life.",

      "abstract": "Tumor cells are characterized by a delicate balance between elevated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant capacity. This intricate equilibrium, maintained within a threshold known as redox homeostasis, offers a unique perspective for cancer treatment by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels beyond cellular tolerability, thereby disrupting this balance. However, currently used chemotherapy drugs require larger doses to increase ROS levels beyond the redox homeostasis threshold, which may cause serious side effects. How to disrupt redox homeostasis in cancer cells more effectively remains a challenge. In this study, we found that sodium selenite and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid extracted from marine fish, synergistically induced cytotoxic effects in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Physiological doses of DHA simultaneously upregulated oxidation and antioxidant levels within the threshold range without affecting cell viability. However, it rendered the cells more susceptible to reaching the upper limit of the threshold of redox homeostasis, facilitating the elevation of ROS levels beyond the threshold by combining with low doses of sodium selenite, thereby disrupting redox homeostasis and inducing MAPK-mediated paraptosis. This study highlights the synergistic anticancer effects of sodium selenite and DHA, which induce paraptosis by disrupting redox homeostasis in tumor cells. These findings offer a novel strategy for more targeted and less toxic cancer therapies for colorectal cancer treatment.",

We previously reported that subjects with coronary artery disease randomly allocated to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation or none had similar significant increases in CAC score over 30 months. Whether these findings are influenced by diabetes status is unknown. A total of 242 subjects with coronary artery disease who were on statin therapy were randomly allocated to to 1.86 g EPA and 1.5 g DHA daily or none (control). The CAC score was measured at baseline and 30-month follow-up using noncontrast, cardiac computed tomography. A significant interaction term between diabetes status and treatment arm was noted in the prediction of the CAC score (p <0.001). A total of 176 subjects (85.8% men) had no diabetes and 66 subjects (80.3% men) had diabetes. The mean age was 62.9 ± 7.9 versus 63.2 ± 7.1 years, respectively. The mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and median triglyceride levels were not significantly different between those without and with diabetes: 77.7 ± 25.9 versus 77.1 ± 30.2 mg/100 ml, respectively, and 117.0 (78.0 to 158.0) versus 119.0 (84.5 to 201.5) mg/100 ml, respectively. Subjects with diabetes on EPA+DHA had a greater increase in CAC score than subjects with diabetes in the control group (median 380.7 vs 183.5, respectively, p = 0.021). In contrast, no difference occurred between the EPA+DHA and control groups in subjects without diabetes (175.7 vs 201.1, respectively, p = 0.41). In conclusion, EPA+DHA supplementation was associated with greater CAC progression in subjects with diabetes than subjects with diabetes in the control group over a 30-month period; whether this indicates progression of the disease burden or plaque stabilization requires further study.",

The combination therapies can overcome the deficiency of single therapy, enhance the therapeutic effects and reduce the side effects at the same time. In this study, we synthesize a novel nanomedicine that enhanced the therapeutic effects of breast cancer treatment by combining photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The doxorubicin (DOX) and photosensitizer methyl pyropheophorbide-a (MPPa) are loaded into the nano-drug delivery system as DPSPFA/MPPa/DOX. In response to near-infrared (NIR) laser, the drugs were quickly released to the cancer cells. The MPPa produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the action of photodynamics. Unsaturated fatty acids with ROS promotes lipid peroxidation and the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. The data shows that the DPSPFA/MPPa/DOX has a spherical shape, good dispersibility and stability, and the particle size is roughly 200 nm. The drug loading capability of DOX is about 13 %. Both of MCF7 cell model in vitro and breast cancer model in vivo, DPSPFA/MPPa/DOX showed an excellent anti-tumor effect of 86.9 % and without any obvious side effects. These findings might offer potential for a new approach for breast cancer treatment.",

Given that preclinical and clinical studies suggest benefits of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid, and exercise in Parkinson's disease, we investigated whether both could synergistically interact to induce recovery of the dopaminergic pathway. First, mice received a unilateral stereotactic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the striatum to establish an animal model of nigrostriatal denervation. Four weeks after lesion, animals were fed a docosahexaenoic acid-enriched or a control diet for the next 8 weeks. During this period, the animals had access to a running wheel, which they could use or not. Docosahexaenoic acid treatment, voluntary exercise, or the combination of both had no effect on (i) distance traveled in the open field test, (ii) the percentage of contraversive rotations in the apomorphine-induction test or (iii) the number of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, the docosahexaenoic acid diet increased the number of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive terminals and induced a rise in dopamine concentrations in the lesioned striatum. Compared to docosahexaenoic acid treatment or exercise alone, the combination of docosahexaenoic acid and exercise (i) improved forelimb balance in the stepping test, (ii) decreased the striatal DOPAC/dopamine ratio and (iii) led to increased dopamine transporter levels in the lesioned striatum. The present results suggest that the combination of exercise and docosahexaenoic acid may act synergistically in the striatum of mice with a unilateral lesion of the dopaminergic system and provide support for clinical trials combining nutrition and physical exercise in the treatment of Parkinson's disease."

      "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, offers several beneficial effects. DHA helps in reducing depression, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. It can stimulate the development of brain and nerve, alleviate lipids metabolism-related disorders, and enhance vision development. However, DHA susceptibility to chemical oxidation, poor water solubility, and unpleasant order could restrict its applications for nutritional and therapeutic purposes. To avoid these drawbacks and enhance its bioavailability, DHA can be encapsulated using an effective delivery system. Several encapsulation methods are recognized, and DHA-loaded nanoparticles have demonstrated numerous benefits. In clinical studies, positive influences on the development of several diseases have been reported, but some assumptions are conflicting and need more exploration, since DHA has a systemic and not a targeted release at the required level. This might cause the applications of nanoparticles that could allow DHA release at the required level and improve its efficiency, thus resulting in a better controlling of several diseases. In the current review, we focused on researches investigating the formulation and development of DHA-loaded nanoparticles using different delivery systems, including low-density lipoprotein, zinc oxide, silver, zein, and resveratrol-stearate. Silver-DHA nanoparticles presented a typical particle size of 24 nm with an incorporation level of 97.67 %, while the entrapment efficiency of zinc oxide-DHA nanoparticles represented 87.3 %. By using zein/Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) stabilized nanoparticles, DHA's encapsulation level reached 84.6 %. We have also highlighted the characteristics, functionality and medical implementation of these nanoparticles in the treatment of inflammations, brain disorders, diabetes as well as hepatocellular carcinoma."

      "abstract": "Globally, the rise in neurodegenerative issues in tandem with shifts in lifestyle and aging population has prompted a search for effective interventions. Nutraceutical compounds have emerged as promising agents for addressing these challenges. This 60-day study on an aluminum-induced cognitive impairment rat model assessed three compounds and their combinations: probiotics (Prob, Lactobacillus plantarum [5 × 1010 CFU/day], and Lactobacillus acidophilus [5 × 1010 CFU/day]), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 23.8 mg/day), and vitamin D3 (VD3, 150 IU/day). Behavioral outcomes were evaluated by using the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Glial activation was assessed through immunofluorescence analysis of GFAP/Iba1, and oxidative stress markers in brain tissue were determined by measuring the levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD). The results demonstrated a progressive improvement in the learning and memory capacity. The aluminum group exhibited the poorest performance in the behavioral test, enhanced GFAP/Iba1 activation, and elevated levels of oxidative stress markers. Conversely, the DHA + Prob + VD3 treatment demonstrated the best performance in the Morris water maze. The combination of DHA + Prob + VD3 exhibited superior performance in the Morris water maze, accompanied by reduced levels of GFAP/Iba1 activation in DG/CA1 brain regions. Furthermore, DHA + Prob supplementation showed lower GFAP/Iba1 activation in the CA3 region and enhanced antioxidant activity. In summary, supplementing various nutraceutical combinations, including DHA, VD3, and Prob, displayed notable benefits against aluminum-induced cognitive impairment. These benefits encompassed memory enhancement, diminished MDA concentration, increased SOD activity, and reduced glial activation, as indicated by GFAP/Iba1 markers."

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs): eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are known to contribute to the reduction of inflammation, preservation of lean body mass and total body weight, and reduction of cancer-related symptoms, such as anorexia or neuropathy. This systematic review aimed to assess whether the ratio of EPA to DHA used in supplementation in cancer patients matters in the context of the resolution of inflammation and reduction of the risk of cachexia. The analysis included 20 randomized clinical trials with acceptable quality identified from the Pubmed/MEDLINE database. The significant results concerning the resolution of inflammation or improvement in nutritional status were the highest in the case of a low EPA/DHA ratio, i.e., 67%, and decreased, reaching 50% and 36% for the moderate and high ratios, respectively. Most results concerning body weight from high and moderate EPA/DHA ratios showed no benefit or were insignificant. A significant benefit in reducing any reported inflammatory markers was seen in the low EPA/DHA ratio subgroup at 63%, in the moderate at 29%, and in the high ratio subgroup at 11%. The greatest benefit in CRP reduction was obtained by patients during chemotherapy. The review questions the anticachectic and anti-inflammatory effect of ω-3 PUFAs supplementation with doses of EPA higher than DHA. A population that particularly benefits from ω-3 PUFAs supplementation are patients undergoing chemotherapy for advanced cancer.",

      "abstract": "Infectious diseases, particularly those associated with biofilms, are challenging to treat due to an increased tolerance to commonly used antibiotics. This underscores the urgent need for innovative antimicrobial strategies. Here, we present an alternative simple-by-design approach focusing on the development of biocompatible and antibiotic-free nanocarriers from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that has the potential to combat microbial infections and phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), which is attractive for use as a biocompatible prominent amphiphilic component of Gram-positive bacterial cell membranes. We assessed the anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activities of these nanoformulations (hexosomes and vesicles) against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, which are the most common causes of infections on catheters and medical devices by different methods (including resazurin assay, time-kill assay, and confocal laser scanning microscopy on an in vitro catheter biofilm model). In a DHA-concentration-dependent manner, these nano-self-assemblies demonstrated strong anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activities, particularly against S. aureus. A five-fold reduction of the planktonic and a four-fold reduction of biofilm populations of S. aureus were observed after treatment with hexosomes. The nanoparticles had a bacteriostatic effect against S. epidermidis planktonic cells but no anti-biofilm activity was detected. We discuss the findings in terms of nanoparticle-bacterial cell interactions, plausible alterations in the phospholipid membrane composition, and potential penetration of DHA into these membranes, leading to changes in their structural and biophysical properties. The implications for the future development of biocompatible nanocarriers for the delivery of DHA alone or in combination with other anti-bacterial agents are discussed, as novel treatment strategies of Gram-positive infections, including biofilm-associated infections.",

      "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential component for brain development during fetal and early postnatal life. Hyperbilirubinemia is characterized by abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream, frequently leading to jaundice in newborns. In severe instances, this condition can progress to neurological damage or kernicterus, a form of brain damage. Initial cell-based experiments conducted by our research team revealed that DHA significantly enhances the survival rate of nerve cells treated with bilirubin and diminishes the oxidative stress indicated by reduced peroxide activity caused by unconjugated bilirubin (UCB). Further investigations through animal studies demonstrated that DHA effectively mitigates bilirubin-induced brain injury in neonatal rats. However, the potential of DHA to decrease the incidence of bilirubin-induced brain damage in clinical settings has not been previously explored or reported. Infants with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (n = 30 per group) participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel study. They received either 100 mg/d DHA or placebo syrup immediately when they were diagnosed. The study found that the bilirubin level at 48 hours of treatment, serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels, mean phototherapy duration, and abnormal rate of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were lower in the DHA group than those in the control group (P < .05). These results suggested that DHA is effective as an adjuvant treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in children. It can reduce the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia brain injury and plays a certain protective role. Clinical study on protective effect of DHA on neonatal bilirubin injury is registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR2300070250.",

Dietary lipids play a role in inflammation and its resolution. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of DHA and olive oil on the birth weight of pups born to alcohol-exposed dams. METHODS: Pregnant rats were randomized to the control or three treatment (alcohol) groups. From gestational days (GD) 8-19, the control group received daily olive oil and malto/dextrose, whereas groups 2 and 3 received olive oil and low-dose alcohol or high-dose alcohol, respectively. Group 4 received daily DHA and high-dose alcohol. The dam's blood was collected on GD 15 and 20 for cytokine analysis. Dams were sacrificed on GD 20. The mean birth weight of pups was compared by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Duncan's test. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the pups' mean birth weight in the high-dose alcohol/DHA and high-dose alcohol/olive oil. Higher pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-12p70) were noted in the alcohol-exposed dams. CONCLUSIONS: DHA and olive oil supplementation in alcohol-exposed pregnant rats significantly increased their pups' birth weight despite having high pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism of this effect remains to be determined."

Moreover, 7S,14R-diHDHA can enhance mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) functions in the amelioration of diabetic mellitus and retinal pericyte loss in diabetic db/db mice. Methods: MSCs treated with 7S,14R-diHDHA were delivered into db/db mice i.v. every 5 days for 35 days. Results: Blood glucose levels in diabetic mice were lowered by 7S,14R-diHDHA-treated MSCs compared to control and untreated MSC groups, accompanied by improved glucose tolerance and higher blood insulin levels. 7S,14R-diHDHA-treated MSCs increased insulin+ β-cell ratio and decreased glucogan+ α-cell ratio in islets, as well as reduced macrophages in pancreas. 7S,14R-diHDHA induced MSC functions in promoting MIN6 β-cell viability and insulin secretion. 7S,14R-diHDHA induced MSC paracrine functions by increasing the generation of hepatocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, 7S,14R-diHDHA enhanced MSC functions to ameliorate diabetes-caused pericyte loss in diabetic retinopathy by increasing their density in retina in db/db mice. Discussion: Our findings provide a novel strategy for improving therapy for diabetes and diabetic retinopathy using 7S,14R-diHDHA-primed MSCs."

Spinal motor neurons (MNs) are seriously injured in the early stage after SCI, but this has not received sufficient attention. Oxidative stress is known to play a crucial role in SCI pathology. Our studies demonstrated that oxidative stress can cause severe damage to the cytoskeleton of spinal MNs. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been shown to have beneficial effects on SCI, but the mechanism remains unclear, and no study has investigated the effect of DHA on oxidative stress-induced spinal MN injury. Here, we investigated the effect of DHA on spinal MN injury through in vivo and in vitro experiments, focusing on the cytoskeleton. We found that DHA not only promoted spinal MN survival but, more importantly, alleviated the severe cytoskeletal destruction of these neurons induced by oxidative stress in vitro and in mice with SCI in vivo. In addition, the mechanisms involved were investigated and elucidated. These results not only suggested a beneficial role of DHA in spinal MN cytoskeletal destruction caused by oxidative stress and SCI but also indicated the important role of the spinal MN cytoskeleton in the recovery of motor function after SCI. Our study provides new insights for the formulation of SCI treatment.",

      "abstract": "PM2.5 exposure is a challenging environmental issue that is closely related to cognitive development impairment; however, currently, relevant means for prevention and treatment remain lacking. Herein, we determined the preventive effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on the neurodevelopmental toxicity induced by PM2.5 exposure. Neonatal rats were divided randomly into three groups: control, PM2.5, and DHA + PM2.5 groups. DHA could ameliorate PM2.5-induced learning and memory dysfunction, as well as reverse the impairment of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, evidenced by enhanced long-term potentiation, recovered synaptic ultrastructure, and increased expression of synaptic proteins. Moreover, DHA increased CREB phosphorylation and BDNF levels and attenuated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, reflected by lower levels of IBA-1, IL-1β, and IL-6 and increased levels of SOD1 and Nrf2. In summary, our findings demonstrated that supplementation of DHA effectively mitigated the cognitive dysfunction and synaptic plasticity impairment induced by early postnatal exposure to PM2.5. These beneficial effects may be attributed to the upregulation of the CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, as well as the reduction of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumor cells express immune-checkpoint molecules to suppress anti-tumor immune responses. In part, immune evasion takes place by secreting exosomes bearing immune-checkpoint and immunomodulatory molecules and their inducing and/or regulating agents e.g., microRNAs (miRs). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on the expression of some selected immune-checkpoint and immunomodulatory molecules and their regulating miRs under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in triple negative (TNBC) invasive and triple positive non-invasive breast cancer cell lines. METHODS: MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cells were treated with 100 µM DHA under hypoxic and normoxic conditions for 24 h. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifuge and confirmed by electron microscope and anti-CD9, -CD63, -CD81 immunoblotting. Total RNA from cells and exosomes were extracted and expression of CD39, CD73, CD47, CD80, PD-L1, B7-H3, B7-H4 genes and their related miRs were evaluated by quantitative Real-time PCR. RESULTS: This study showed significant over-expression of immune-checkpoint and immunomodulatory molecules under hypoxic condition. Treatment with DHA resulted in a significant decrease in immune-checkpoint and immunomodulatory molecule expression as well as an upregulation of their regulatory miRNA expression. CONCLUSION: DHA supplementation may be utilized in breast cancer therapy for down-regulation of cellular and exosomal immune escape-related molecules."

DHA-containing microalgal oil was converted to ethyl esters (EE) as the raw material. In comparison to cooling, rotary-evaporation crystallization, as a post-treatment method for urea complexation, led to higher DHA contents in the non-urea included fractions. The ratios of urea to EE converted from DHA-containing microalgal oil was found to be the primary factors influencing urea complexation when using rotary-evaporation crystallization. Through an orthogonal test, optimal process conditions were determined, including a urea/EE ratio of 2, an ethanol/urea ratio of 7, and a rotary-evaporation temperature of 75℃. Under these conditions, a concentrate containing more than 90% DHA could be obtained.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Endocannabinoid signaling regulates energy homeostasis, and is tightly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The study previously finds that supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has superior function to ameliorate NAFLD compared with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The present study aims to investigate whether DHA intervention alleviates NAFLD via endocannabinoid system. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a case-control study, the serum endocannabinoid ligands in 60 NAFLD and 60 healthy subjects are measured. Meanwhile, NAFLD model is established in mice fed a high-fat and -cholesterol diet (HFD) for 9 weeks. DHA or EPA is administrated for additional 9 weeks. Serum primary endocannabinoid ligands, namely anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidoniylglycerol (2-AG), are significantly higher in individuals with NAFLD compared with healthy controls. NAFLD model shows that serum 2-AG concentrations and adipocyte cannabinoid receptor 1 expression levels are significantly lower in DHA group compared with HFD group. Lipidomic and targeted ceramide analyses further confirm that endocannabinoid signaling inhibition has exerted deletion of hepatic C16:0-ceramide contents, resulting in down-regulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis and up-regulation of fatty acid β-oxidation related protein expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: This work elucidates that DHA has improved NAFLD by suppressing endocannabinoid system.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During fetal development, the proper development of neural and visual systems relies on the maternal supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids through placental transfer. Pregnant women are strongly advised to augment their diet with additional sources of omega-3, such as fish oil (FO). This supplementation has been linked to a reduced risk of preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, and perinatal depression. Recently, higher doses of omega-3 supplementation have been recommended for pregnant women. Considering that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play a crucial role in maintaining the delicate homeostasis required for the proper functioning of the retina and photoreceptors the effects of high-dose fish oil (FO) supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the retina and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) in healthy offspring warrant better understanding. METHODS: The fatty acid content and the changes in the expression of the genes regulating cholesterol homeostasis and DHA transport in the retina and RPE were evaluated following the high-dose FO supplementation. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that despite the high-dose FO treatment during pregnancy and lactation, the rigorous DHA homeostasis in the retina and RPE of the two-month-old offspring remained balanced. Another significant finding of this study is the increase in the expression levels of major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein (Mfsd2a), a primary DHA transporter. Mfsd2a also serves as a major regulator of transcytosis during development, and a reduction in Mfsd2a levels poses a major risk for the development of leaky blood vessels. CONCLUSION: Impairment of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is associated with the development of numerous ocular diseases, and a better understanding of how to manipulate transcytosis in the BRB during development can enhance drug delivery through the BRB or contribute to the repair of central nervous system (CNS) barriers."

      "abstract": "Whey protein isolate (WPI)-based nanodelivery systems have recently attracted an increasing amount of attention. Despite this, research focusing on milk protein concentrate (MPC) and micellar casein (MCC) as carriers loaded in hydrophobic compounds is lacking. This study investigated the mediated effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in 3 different milk proteins for the embedding of astaxanthin (ASTA) after ultrasound-assisted pH-shifting treatment. We then evaluated the application of milk protein carriers in cheese processing by comparing MPC, MCC, and WPI. The particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential results of the milk protein-DHA complex suggested that the addition of 0.36 μmol/mL DHA optimized the delivery of milk protein to ASTA. All 3 DHA-mediated milk proteins induced an improvement in encapsulation efficiency and antioxidant properties of ASTA. Furthermore, the DHA-mediated MPC and MCC played a stronger role in improving the bioaccessibility and thermal and storage stability of ASTA than those without DHA. Tests conducted to examine the application in cheese production indicated that MCC carrier had a positive effect on the texture of cheeses. However, the delivery effect was dependent on the milk protein variety, and MCC exhibited the best protection ability of ASTA, followed by MPC and WPI. The simulated digestion and storage stability results of cheese further confirmed that the protein encapsulation mediated by DHA was more conducive to ASTA absorption. These findings suggested that the DHA-mediated milk protein complexes studied here may be suitable hydrophilic delivery carriers for the hydrophobic nutrient ASTA, potentially playing different roles in improving its storage stability and bioaccessibility.",

A lipid mediator (LM, namely, 17S-monohydroxy docosahexaenoic acid, resolvin D5, and protectin DX in a ratio of 3:47:50) produced by soybean lipoxygenase from DHA, exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we determined the effect of LM on collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) in mice and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation in RAW264.7 cells. LM effectively downregulated the expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K, inhibited osteoclast formation, and suppressed the NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro. In vivo, LM at 10 μg/kg/day significantly decreased paw swelling and inhibited progression of arthritis in CAIA mice. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-17, and interferon-γ) levels in serum were decreased, whereas IL-10 levels were increased following LM treatment. Furthermore, LM alleviated joint inflammation, cartilage erosion, and bone destruction in the ankles, which may be related to matrix metalloproteinase and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that LM attenuates arthritis severity, restores serum imbalances, and modifies joint damage. Thus, LM represents a promising therapy for relieving RA symptoms.",

DHA has anti-inflammatory activity, but its effects on the fetal heart and circulation are unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether maternal DHA supplementation in the third trimester affects maternal prostaglandin levels and fetal ductus arteriosus flow dynamics. METHODS: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial with parallel groups conducted between 2018 and 2021. Pregnant women aged over 18 years with a normal fetus at 27-28 weeks' gestation showing no cardiac/extracardiac anomalies or ductal constriction were eligible for the trial. Women consuming substances with a known inhibitory effect on prostaglandin metabolism, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and polyphenol-rich foods, were excluded. The intervention group received oral supplementation of omega-3 with 450 mg/day of DHA for 8 weeks and the placebo group received capsules of soy lecithin for 8 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, assessment of polyphenol and omega-3 consumption, fetal morphological ultrasound examination, fetal Doppler echocardiographic examination and blood sample collection were performed at the start of the study and the latter two were repeated at follow-up. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level and echocardiographic parameters were compared between the intervention and placebo groups and between baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 24 participants were included in each group. After 8 weeks, there were no significant differences between the intervention and placebo groups in maternal serum PGE2 level or Doppler echocardiographic parameters of ductal flow. No case of ductus arteriosus constriction was observed. The expected intragroup changes in cardiac morphology, as a result of advancing gestation, were present. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal DHA supplementation in the third trimester at a clinically recommended dose did not result in inhibition of PGE2 or constriction of the ductus arteriosus. These findings should be confirmed in postmarket surveillance studies with larger patient numbers in order to test the full safety profile of DHA and provide robust clinical reassurance. © 2024 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), can prevent gastric and small intestinal damage. Nonetheless, contribution of antioxidative action in the protective effect of DHA has not been evaluated before in the small intestine injury after indomethacin treatment. Pathogenesis of NSAID-induced small intestinal injury is multifactorial, and reactive oxidative species have been related to indomethacin's small intestinal damage. The present work aimed to evaluate antioxidative activity in the protective action of DHA in the indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage. Female Wistar rats were gavage with DHA (3 mg/kg) or omeprazole (3 mg/kg) for 10 days. Each rat received indomethacin (3 mg/kg, orally) daily to induce small intestinal damage. The total area of intestinal ulcers and histopathological analysis were performed. In DHA-treated rats, myeloperoxidase and superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione, malondialdehyde, leukotriene, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels were measured. Furthermore, the relative abundance of selective bacteria was assessed. DHA administration (3 mg/kg, p.o.) caused a significant decrease in indomethacin-induced small intestinal injury in Wistar rats after 10 days of treatment. DHA's enteroprotection resulted from the prevention of an increase in myeloperoxidase activity, and lipoperoxidation, as well as an improvement in the antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity in the small intestine. Furthermore, we showed that DHA's enteroprotective effect decreased significantly LPS levels in indomethacin-induced injury in small intestine. Our data suggest that DHA's enteroprotective might be attributed to the prevention of oxidative stress.",

Very preterm infants are deprived of the enhanced placental supply of these fatty acids, but the benefit of postnatal supplementation on brain development is uncertain. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that early enteral supplementation with ARA and DHA in preterm infants improves white matter (WM) microstructure assessed by diffusion-weighted MRI at term equivalent age. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, infants born before 29 weeks gestational age were allocated to either 100 mg/kg ARA and 50 mg/kg DHA (ARA:DHA group) or medium chain triglycerides (control). Supplements were started on the second day of life and provided until 36 weeks postmenstrual age. The primary outcome was brain maturation assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis. RESULTS: We included 120 infants (60 per group) in the trial; mean (range) gestational age was 26+3 (22+6 - 28+6) weeks and postmenstrual age at scan was 41+3 (39+1 - 47+0) weeks. Ninety-two infants underwent MRI imaging, and of these, 90 had successful T1/T2 weighted MR images and 74 had DTI data of acceptable quality. TBSS did not show significant differences in mean or axial diffusivity between the groups, but demonstrated significantly higher fractional anisotropy in several large WM tracts in the ARA:DHA group, including corpus callosum, the anterior and posterior limb of the internal capsula, inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Radial diffusivity was also significantly lower in several of the same WM tracts in the ARA:DHA group. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that supplementation with ARA and DHA at doses matching estimated fetal accretion rates improves WM maturation compared to control treatment, but further studies are needed to ascertain any functional benefit.

Higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores and progression of CAC are associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality. We examined the effect of EPA + DHA on CAC score. METHODS: A total of 242 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) on statin therapy were randomized to 1.86 g EPA and 1.5 g DHA daily or none (control) for 30 months. The CAC score was measured at baseline and 30-months with non-contrast, cardiac computed tomography. RESULTS: Both EPA + DHA and control groups had significant progression in CAC scores over 30 months (median change:183.5 vs 221.0, respectively, p < 0.001) despite a 13.6% reduction in triglyceride level with EPA + DHA. No significant difference was observed between groups for the total group, by baseline CAC scores of <100, 100-399, 400-999 and ≥1000 or quartiles of achieved levels of EPA, DHA and the omega-3 fatty acid index. Similar rates of CAC progression were noted in those on high-intensity statin compared to low- and moderate-intensity statin. CONCLUSIONS: EPA and DHA added to statin resulted in similar CAC progression over 30 months regardless of baseline CAC categories, statin intensity and achieved levels of EPA, DHA and the omega-3 fatty acid index.",

A total of 238 multiparous sows were allocated to either a control diet group or a DHA diet group with an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 9.8 and 2.4, respectively, from mating to day 43 of gestation. A blood sample was collected and back fat thickness was measured prior to mating, on days 14, 42 and 112 of gestation. On day 43 of gestation, 14 sows were slaughtered and measurements of fetuses and placentas were taken. Piglets in some litters were weighed individually at farrowing. Dietary treatment did not affect fetal characteristics and back fat thickness (P > 0.05). Dietary treatment increased the plasma concentrations of total omega-3 fatty acids in sows (P < 0.05). Sows fed the DHA diet had a shorter gestation length compared to the control sows (P < 0.05), but the number of born piglets was not affected (P > 0.05). The average piglet birth weight and the within-litter variation in birthweight were unaffected by dietary DHA (P > 0.05), however, sows fed DHA diet had fewer piglets under 800 g at birth compared to control sows (P < 0.05). In conclusion, addition of DHA decreased the dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, increased plasma n-3 fatty acid concentrations in sows and decreased the number of piglets weighing under 800 g at birth.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Children born at less than 29 weeks' gestation are at risk of behavioral difficulties. This may be due in part to the lack of transplacental supply of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a key fatty acid with structural and functional roles in the brain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether meeting the neonatal DHA requirement through supplementation is associated with improved behavioral functioning of children born at less than 29 weeks' gestation. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a follow-up of children from 10 Australian participating centers in a multi-center, blinded, parallel group randomized clinical trial of infants born at less than 29 weeks' gestation conducted from June 2012 and September 2015, excluding those with additional fatty acid supplementation or major congenital or chromosomal abnormalities. Follow-up took place from August 2018 to May 2021. Parents of surviving children who had not withdrawn from the original trial were invited to complete questionnaires when the child turned 5 years' corrected age. INTERVENTIONS: Infants were randomized to receive daily enteral emulsions providing 60 mg/kg/d of DHA or a soy-oil emulsion (with no DHA) from within the first 3 days of enteral feeding until 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or discharge home, whichever occurred first. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome of this follow-up was parent-rated behavior and emotional functioning as indicated by the Total Difficulties score of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Parents also completed questionnaires about their child's behavioral manifestations of executive functioning, as well as a range of health outcomes to assess potential longer-term side effects of DHA intervention. RESULTS: Primary outcome data were available for 731 children (76% of 958 surviving eligible children; 361 in the intervention group and 370 in the control group). Of these 731, 452 (47%) were female, and the mean (SD) corrected age at follow-up was 5.4 (0.5) years. Following imputation for missing data, the mean Total Difficulties score was the same in both groups (intervention group, n = 465; mean [SD], 11.8 [6.3]; control group, n = 493; mean [SD], 11.8 [6.0]; mean difference adjusted for sex, gestational age stratum, and hospital, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.87 to 0.89; P = .98). There was no evidence for differences between the groups in any secondary outcomes of behavior, executive functioning, or health. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this follow-up of a randomized clinical trial, enteral DHA supplementation at the equivalent of the estimated in utero dose for infants born at less than 29 weeks' gestation did not improve behavioral functioning at age 5 years. There were no indications of adverse effects with DHA supplementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry: ACTRN12612000503820.",

METHODS/PROCEDURES: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial was conducted at a single private practice site. Participants were drawn from patients attending the practice.Patients meeting criteria had a 4-week run-in period where they continued to receive their prescribed medications and omega-3 supplements. Depression and anxiety ratings were assessed at recruitment and completion of the run-in phase. Patients were randomized to receive an omega-3 supplement (Neurospark) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks then crossed over to the alternative treatment. At the end of the double-blind, cross-over phase, patients received the supplement and were assessed after a 4-week run-out phase.Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton scales. Efficacy of treatment was assessed using a linear mixed model analysis with time, order of treatment, diagnosis, and their interaction as factors. Depression and anxiety scales were analyzed as independent measures. RESULTS: The study enrolled 47 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.1 [11.2] years; [59.6%] male). Depression scores did not significantly change across assessments ( P > 0.1); there was no effect of order of treatment ( P > 0.1) or an interaction between time, order of treatment, and psychiatric diagnosis ( P > 0.1). Anxiety scores were similarly unchanged across treatment visits and order of treatment, and there was no interaction between time, order of treatment, and psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation did not significantly alter residual symptoms in this group of patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) is an active ingredient extracted from Lycium barbarum that inhibits neuroinflammation, and Lycium barbarum glycopeptide (LbGp) is a glycoprotein with immunological activity that was purified and isolated from LBP. Previous studies have shown that LbGp can regulate the immune microenvironment, but its specific mechanism of action remains unclear. AIMS: In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanism of action of LbGp in the treatment of spinal cord injury through metabolomics and molecular experiments. METHODS: SD male rats were randomly assigned to three experimental groups, and after establishing the spinal cord hemisection model, LbGp was administered orally. Spinal cord tissue was sampled on the seventh day after surgery for molecular and metabolomic experiments. In vitro, LbGp was administered to mimic the inflammatory microenvironment by activating microglia, and its mechanism of action in suppressing neuroinflammation was further elaborated using metabolomics and molecular biology techniques such as western blotting and q-PCR. RESULTS: In vivo and in vitro experiments found that LbGp can improve the inflammatory microenvironment by inhibiting the NF-kB and pyroptosis pathways. Furthermore, LbGp induced the secretion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by microglia, and DHA inhibited neuroinflammation through the MAPK/NF-κB and pyroptosis pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we hypothesize that LbGp improves the inflammatory microenvironment by regulating the secretion of DHA by microglia and thereby inhibiting the MAPK/NF-κB and pyroptosis pathways and promoting nerve repair and motor function recovery. This study provides a new direction for the treatment of spinal cord injury and elucidates the potential mechanism of action of LbGp.",

Inconsistent results may be attributable to variants of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) genes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effect of prenatal DHA supplementation on offspring CMH and investigate effect modification by maternal FADS2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs174602. METHODS: We used follow-up data from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in Mexico in which pregnant females received 400 mg/d of algal DHA or placebo from midgestation until delivery. The study sample included 314 offspring with data at age 11 y and maternal FADS genetic data (DHA: n = 160; Placebo: n = 154). We derived a Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) score from body mass index, HDL, triglycerides, fasting glucose concentrations, and systolic blood pressure. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on offspring MetS score and test interactions between treatment group and genotype, adjusting for maternal, offspring, and household factors. RESULTS: Offspring MetS score did not differ significantly by treatment group. We observed evidence of effect modification by maternal SNP rs174602 (P = 0.001); offspring of maternal TT genotype who received DHA had lower MetS score relative to the placebo group (DHA (mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM)): -0.21 ± 0.11, n = 21; Placebo: 0.05 ± 0.11, n = 23; Δ= -0.26 (95% CI: -0.55, 0.04), P = 0.09); among CC maternal genotype carriers, offspring of mothers who received DHA had higher MetS score (0.18 ± 0.06, n = 62) relative to the placebo group (-0.05 ± 0.06, n = 65, Δ=0.24 (0.06, 0.41), P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The effect of prenatal DHA supplementation on offspring MetS score differed by maternal FADS SNP rs174602. These findings further support incorporating genetic analysis of FADS polymorphisms in DHA supplementation trials.

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) positively improve brain glucose metabolism and decrease the expression of AD-related proteins. However, the effects of the combined intervention are unclear. The present study explored the effects of the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA in improving brain glucose metabolism and decreasing AD-related protein expression levels in APP/PS1 mice. The mice were assigned into four dietary treatment groups: the control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. The corresponding diet of the respective groups was fed to mice from the age of 3 to 11 months. The results showed that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could increase serum octanoic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), DHA, and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) levels; improve glucose metabolism; and reduce nerve cell apoptosis in the brain. Moreover, it also aided with decreasing the expression levels of amyloid beta protein (Aβ), amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1) in the brain. Furthermore, the supplementation of MCTs + DHA was significantly more beneficial than that of MCTs or DHA alone. In conclusion, the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could improve energy metabolism in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, thus decreasing nerve cell apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of Aβ.",

We studied unsettled issues in the association between MDA-LDL and the pathophysiology of ASD in 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and eight age-matched controls. Social behaviors were assessed using the social responsiveness scale (SRS). To overcome the problem of using small samples, adaptive Lasso was used to enhance the interpretability accuracy, and a coefficient of variation was used for variable selections. Plasma levels of the MDA-LDL levels (91.00 ± 16.70 vs. 74.50 ± 18.88) and the DHA/arachidonic acid (ARA) ratio (0.57 ± 0.16 vs. 0.37 ± 0.07) were significantly higher and the superoxide dismutase levels were significantly lower in the ASD group than those in the control group. Total SRS scores in the ASD group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The unbeneficial DHA/ARA ratio induced ferroptosis via lipid peroxidation. Multiple linear regression analysis and adaptive Lasso revealed an association of the DHA/ARA ratio with total SRS scores and increased MDA-LDL levels in plasma, resulting in neuronal deficiencies. This unbeneficial DHA/ARA-ratio-induced ferroptosis contributes to autistic social behaviors and is available for therapy.",

      "abstract": "The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor X1 (NLRX1) has been associated with various anti-inflammatory mechanisms. We investigated whether the NLRX1 ligand docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ameliorates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia by interacting with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)/inhibitor of kB (IkB) kinase (IKK)/IkB-a/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in the central nervous system. Reaction time to thermal stimuli within 30 seconds was measured in male mice injected with saline, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and/or DHA after 6 hours using the hot plate test. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies were performed to determine the activation of the TRAF6/IKK/IkB-a/NF-kB pathway in the brains and spinal cords of animals. Latency to the thermal stimulus was reduced by 30% in LPS-injected endotoxemic mice compared with saline-injected mice. Treatment with DHA significantly improved latency compared with endotoxemic mice. In the brain and spinal cord of LPS-injected mice, treatment with DHA also prevented the increase in the expression and/or activity of (1) IKKa/IKKβ, IKKg, and K63 U in the NLRX1-immunoprecipitated tissues, (2) IKKa/IKKβ, K63 U, and K48 U in the IKKg-immunoprecipitated tissues, and (3) IkB-α, NF-kB p65, and interleukin-1β associated with decreased IkB-α expression. These findings suggest that inhibition of IKK/IkB-a/NF-kB signaling by dissociation of NLRX1 from TRAF6 in response to LPS treatment contributes to the protective effect of DHA against inflammatory hyperalgesia.",

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of DHA-concentrated fish oil on the cognitive function of puppies. Twelve 3-month-old puppies were included, blocked by breed and randomly distributed into two groups: the Control Group (CG), without supplementation, and the Experimental Group (EG), supplemented with 40 mg DHA/kg BW/day. The object discrimination test was used, with a normal stage (NS) and a reverse stage (RS), and blood samples were collected to evaluate the serum polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentration and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) before (T0) and 30 (T1), 60 (T2) and 90 (T3) days after beginning the study. For the NS, there were effects of treatment (p = 0.0039) and time (p < 0.0001), in which the correct answer frequency in the EG was higher than the CG. The serum eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + HA concentrations at T1, T2 and T3 were higher than at T0 for the EG (p = 0.0159), in addition, EG showed higher serum EPA + DHA concentrations than CG at T2 (p = 0.0245). The TAC values were similar between the groups (p = 0.3211). It was concluded that the cognitive function of puppies can be enhanced with DHA-concentrated fish oil supplementation without increasing the serum lipid oxidation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Omega 3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been widely consumed as supplements to control chronic inflammation. Nanocapsules containing DHA (MLNC-DHA-a1) were developed and showed excellent stability. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the effect of MLNC-DHA-a1 nanocapsules on biomarkers of chronic inflammation. METHODS: Cells viability was determined by flow cytometry. The uptake of MLNC-DHA-a1 nanocapsules by macrophages and their polarization were determined. In vivo, LDLr(-,-) mice were fed a Western diet to promote chronic inflammation and were treated with MLNC-DHA-a1 nanocapsules, intravenously injected via the caudal vein once a week for 8 weeks. RESULTS: MLNC-DHA-a1 nanocapsules decreased the concentration of TNFα (p = 0.02) in RAW 264.7 cells compared to the non-treated group (NT), with no changes in IL-10 (p = 0.29). The nanocapsules also exhibited an increase in the M2 (F4/80+ CD206) phenotype (p < 0.01) in BMDM cells. In vivo, no difference in body weight was observed among the groups, suggesting that the intervention was well tolerated. However, compared to the CONT group, MLNC-DHA-a1 nanocapsules led to an increase in IL-6 (90.45 ×13.31 pg/mL), IL-1β (2.76 ×1.34 pg/mL) and IL-10 (149.88 ×2.51 pg/mL) levels in plasma. CONCLUSION: MLNC-DHA-a1 nanocapsules showed the potential to promote in vitro macrophage polarization and were well-tolerated in vivo. However, they also increased systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, considering that this immune response presents a limitation for clinical trials, further studies are needed to identify the specific compound in MLNC-DHA-a1 that triggered the immune response. Addressing this issue is essential, as MLNC-DHA-a1 tissue target nanocapsules could contribute to reducing chronic inflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in women. Improved preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies are needed. Certain dietary patterns and nutrients such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are associated with reduced cancer risk, but their effects on ovarian cancer remain to be fully elucidated, and their combined effects have not been explored. AIM: To determine the individual and combined effects of the active vitamin D metabolite, calcitriol, and the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, on cell growth, and the abundance of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), proteins that modulate cell cycle progression, and apoptotic markers. METHODS: OVCAR4 cells, a model of ovarian cancer, were treated with calcitriol, and docosahexaenoic acid, either alone or in combination. Effects on cell growth were determined by the sulforhodamine B assay. Changes in VDR, the cell cycle promotor c-Myc, the cell cycle inhibitor p27 and cleaved PARP, were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: While OVCAR4 cell growth was inhibited by individual treatment with either calcitriol or docosahexaenoic acid, the combined treatment revealed enhanced growth inhibition as compared to either treatment alone. Furthermore, long-term treatment (12 days) yielded stronger growth inhibition at lower concentrations as compared to short-term treatments (3 days). Accompanying this growth inhibition was a decrease in c-Myc, and an increase in p27. CONCLUSIONS: The observed reduction in cell growth mediated by calcitriol and docosahexaenoic acid highlights the need for further research utilizing these nutrients, alone and especially in combination, to support ovarian cancer prevention and treatment."

      "abstract": "AIM: Omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as a new option for controlling the residual risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in the statin era. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is associated with reduced CAD risk in the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention trial, whereas the Statin Residual Risk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia trial that used the combination EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has failed to derive any clinical benefit. These contradictory results raise important questions about whether investigating the antiatherosclerotic effect of omega-3 fatty acids could help to understand their significance for CAD-risk reduction. METHODS: The Attempts at Plaque Vulnerability Quantification with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Noncontrast T1-weighted Technic EPA/DHA study is a single-center, triple-arm, randomized, controlled, open-label trial used to investigate the effect of EPA/DHA on high-risk coronary plaques after 12 months of treatment, detected using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with CAD receiving statin therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to no-treatment, 2-g/day, and 4-g/day EPA/DHA groups. The primary endpoint was the change in the plaque-to-myocardium signal intensity ratio (PMR) of coronary high-intensity plaques detected by CMR. Coronary plaque assessment using computed tomography angiography (CTA) was also investigated. RESULTS: Overall, 84 patients (mean age: 68.2 years, male: 85%) who achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of ＜100 mg/dL were enrolled. The PMR was reduced in each group over 12 months. There were no significant differences in PMR changes among the three groups in the primary analysis or analysis including total lesions. The changes in CTA parameters, including indexes for detecting high-risk features, also did not differ. CONCLUSION: The EPA/DHA therapy of 2 or 4 g/day did not significantly improve the high-risk features of coronary atherosclerotic plaques evaluated using CMR under statin therapy.",

Febrile seizures are classified as simple or complex, and complex febrile seizures increase the risk of temporal lobe epilepsy after growth. Therefore, it is important to interfere with epileptogenesis after febrile seizures to prevent post-growth epilepsy. The present study challenged nutritional intervention using docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Febrile seizures were induced in mice at the age of 10 d using a heat chamber, and seizure sensitivity was examined using pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) administration after growth. PTZ increased the seizure score and shortened the latency in the complex febrile seizure group compared to the control, hyperthermia and simple febrile seizure groups. Mice in the complex febrile seizure group showed abnormal electroencephalograms pre- and post-PTZ administration. Therefore, seizure susceptibility increases the episodes of complex febrile seizures. DHA supplementation after febrile seizures clearly suppressed the increased seizure susceptibility due to complex febrile seizures experienced in infancy. DHA also attenuated microglial activation after complex febrile seizures. Taken together, DHA suppressed microglial activation following complex febrile seizures, which may contribute to protecting the brain from post-growth seizures. The intake of DHA in infancy may protect children from high fever-induced developmental abnormalities.",

AIM: The effects of high-dose DHA supplementation as add-on therapy for idiopathic epilepsy in dogs were evaluated. METHODS: An open-label clinical trial was designed in this pilot study. Six dogs (median age: 6 years) with idiopathic epilepsy were included. All the patients were diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy using magnetic MRI and cerebrospinal fluid examination (median: 2.0 years before the trial). They had 5-45 seizures and/or auras (median: 9.0) in the month before starting DHA supplementation. DHA was adjunctively administered at doses of 69-166 mg/kg/day without changing other prescriptions. RESULTS: Four of the six patients completed the 6-month observation period. All the patients showed a decrease in seizure frequency of 50% or more within 2-3 months after the start of the administration, and three patients decreased to a frequency of 0-1 per month after 5-6 months. No clear adverse events were observed in the general condition or blood test results in any patients. CONCLUSION: Although the sample size was small and the study was not a randomized controlled trial, the data suggest that add-on supplementation of DHA could be useful in reducing the frequency of seizures in canine idiopathic epilepsy.",

These nanoparticles, designated as LLDDNP, underwent a lyophilization process. The study encompassed a comprehensive investigation, including physicochemical characterization, in vivo assessment of biomarkers, and an examination of immune response through cytokine modulation. The zeta potential of LLDDNP was - 24.5 ± 12 mV, while their average particle size was 334.9 z.d.nm. The particles exhibited a conductivity of 2.10 mS/cm, while their mobility in the injectable dosage form was measured at - 3.65 µm cm/Vs. The scanning electron microscopy investigation, the lyophilization processes resulted in discrete particles forming particle aggregations. However, transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that LLDDNP is spherical and smooth. The thermogram showed that about 95% of LLDDNP's weight was lost at 270 °C, indicating that the particles are extremely thermal stable. The XRD analysis of LLDDNP exhibited clear and distinctive peaks at 2θ angles, specifically at 9.6°, 20.3°, 21.1°, 22°, 24.6°, 25.2°, 36°, and 44.08°, providing compelling evidence of the crystalline nature of the particles. According to proton NMR studies, the proton dimension fingerprint region of LLDDNP ranges from 1.00 to 1.03 ppm. The in vitro release of LTF from LLDDNP was found to follow zero-order kinetics, with a commendable R2 value of 0.942, indicating a consistent and predictable release pattern over time. The in vivo investigation revealed a significant impact of hepatotoxicity on the elevation of various cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8R, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ. Additionally, the presence of hepatotoxicity led to an increase in apoptosis markers, namely caspase 3 and caspase 9, as well as elevated levels of liver biomarkers such as CRP, ALP, ALT, and AST. In contrast, the treatment with LLDDNP modulated the levels of all biomarkers, including cytokines level in the treatment group extremely high significant at p < 0.001.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumor and currently lacks an effective treatment. In this study, we utilized a microfluidic system to synthesize docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) liposomes for GBM therapy. DHA is an omega-3 (ω3) polyunsaturated fatty acid commonly found in human dietary consumption that has demonstrated potential in mitigating cancer development. The microfluidic device employed allowed for precise fine-tuning of the physicochemical properties of liposomes by adjusting the flow rate ratios, flow rates, and lipid concentrations. Three distinct-sized liposomes, ranging from 80 nm and 130 nm, were successfully internalized by GBM cells, and demonstrated the ability to reduce the viability of these cells. Furthermore, DHA liposomes proved significantly more efficient in triggering apoptotic pathways, through caspase-3-dependent mechanisms, in comparison to free DHA. Thus, the nanomedicine platform established in this study presents new opportunities in the development of liposome formulations incorporating ω3 fatty acids for cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "The human lifespan has increased over the past century; however, healthspans have not kept up with this trend, especially cognitive health. Among nutrients for brain function maintenance, long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 LCPUFA): DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) must be highlighted, particularly structured forms of EPA and DHA which were developed to improve bioavailability and bioactivity in comparison with conventional ω-3 supplements. This study aims to elucidate the effect of a structured triglyceride form of DHA (DHA-TG) on the healthspan of aged C. elegans. Using a thrashing assay, the nematodes were monitored at 4, 8, and 12 days of adulthood, and DHA-TG improved its motility at every age without affecting lifespan. In addition, the treatment promoted antioxidant capacity by enhancing the activity and expression of SOD (superoxide dismutase) in the nematodes. Lastly, as the effect of DHA-TG was lost in the DAF-16 mutant strain, it might be hypothesized that the effects of DHA need DAF-16/FOXO as an intermediary. In brief, DHA-TG exerted a healthspan-promoting effect resulting in both enhanced physical fitness and increased antioxidant defense in aged C. elegans. For the first time, an improvement in locomotive function in aged wild-type nematodes is described following DHA-TG treatment.",

      "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that benefits the prevention of chronic diseases. Due to its high unsaturation, DHA is vulnerable to free radical oxidation, resulting in several unfavorable effects, including producing hazardous metabolites. However, in vitro and in vivo investigations suggest that the relationship between the chemical structure of DHA and its susceptibility to oxidation may not be as clear-cut as previously thought. Organisms have developed a balanced system of antioxidants to counteract the overproduction of oxidants, and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the key transcription factor identified for transmitting the inducer signal to the antioxidant response element. Thus, DHA might preserve the cellular redox status promoting the transcriptional regulation of cellular antioxidants through Nrf2 activation. Here, we systematically summarize the research on the possible role of DHA in controlling cellular antioxidant enzymes. After the screening process, 43 records were selected and included in this review. Specifically, 29 studies related to the effects of DHA in cell cultures and 15 studies concerned the effects of consumption or treatment with DHA in animal. Despite DHA's promising and encouraging effects at modulating the cellular antioxidant response in vitro/in vivo, some differences observed among the reviewed studies may be accounted for by the different experimental conditions adopted, including the time of supplementation/treatment, DHA concentration, and cell culture/tissue model. Moreover, this review offers potential molecular explanations for how DHA controls cellular antioxidant defenses, including involvement of transcription factors and the redox signaling pathway."

The mean age was 11.7 years. The DHA group showed a statistically significant improvement in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which was observed as early as 6 months and further increased at 12 months. Among the n-3 PUFAs, there was a significant increase in DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Additionally, a statistically significant decrease in n-6 PUFAs was found, primarily due to a decrease in arachidonic acid (AA) levels and elongase 5 activity. However, we did not observe any changes in linoleic acid levels. The long-term administration of DHA over one year was safe and well tolerated. In summary, the administration of a high-rich DHA supplement at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day for one year can correct erythrocyte AA/DHA imbalance and reduce fatty acid inflammatory markers. However, it is important to note that essential fatty acid alterations cannot be fully normalized with this treatment. These data provide timely information of essential fatty acid profile for future comparative research."

Nutritional strategies using omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could be proposed to alleviate inflammation and improve the maintenance of lean mass. Independently, pharmacological agents targeting key molecular regulators of the pathology such as TNF alpha could be proposed, but multiple therapies are frequently necessary increasing the risk for toxicity and adverse effects. The aim of the present study was to explore if the combination of an anti-TNF therapy (Etanercept) with dietary supplementation with omega 3 PUFA could prevent pain and metabolic effects of RA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RA was induced using collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats to explore of supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid, treatment with etanercept or their association could alleviate symptoms of RA (pain, dysmobility), sarcopenia and metabolic alterations. KEY FINDINGS: We observed that Etanercept had major benefits on pain and RA scoring index. However, DHA could reduce the impact on body composition and metabolic alterations. SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed for the first time that nutritional supplementation with omega 3 fatty acid could reduce some symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and be an effective preventive treatment in patients who do not need pharmacological therapy, but no sign of synergy with an anti-TNF agent was observed.",

When cells were cultured in differentiation-inducing medium, neurite-like outgrowths were observed on days 5 and 6. However, no significant difference in morphology was observed in cells with or without DHA treatment. With or without DHA addition, nNOS protein expression was increased on days 5 and 6 compared with day 0. This increase tended to be enhanced by DHA. CaMKII protein expression did not change after differentiation without DHA, but was significantly increased on day 6 compared with day 0 with DHA addition.

Gut microbiota play a key role in Cd absorption. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is thought to have a potential role in the treatment of Cd poisoning. This study investigated the therapeutic effect and mechanism of DHA in Cd-exposed mice from the perspective of the gut microbiota. The results showed that DHA significantly increased the Cd content in feces and decreased the Cd accumulation in the organs of mice. The gut microbiota results showed that DHA significantly restored the abundance of Parabacteroides in the gut microbiota of Cd-exposed mice. Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis), a representative strain of the Parabacteroides, also showed Cd- and toxicity-reduction capabilities. P. distasonis significantly restored the gut damage caused by Cd exposure. At the same time, P. distasonis reduced the Cd content in the liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, gut, and blood to varying degrees and significantly increased the Cd content in feces. The succinic acid produced by P. distasonis plays an important role in promoting Cd excretion in Cd-exposed mice. Therefore, these results suggest that P. distasonis may have a potential role in DHA-mediated Cd excretion in Cd-exposed mice.",

It has been known that omega-3 fatty acids (FA) like eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) could modulate the inflammatory process and improve metabolic markers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effect of high-dose omega-3 FA on metabolic and inflammatory markers among patients with obesity and healthy volunteers. METHODS: This prospective study included 12 women with obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 35.0 kg/m2) and 12 healthy women (BMI < 24.0 kg/m2) who were supplemented with a dose of 4.8 g/day (3.2 g EPA plus 1.6 g DHA) for 3 months followed by no treatment for 1 month. Plasma metabolic and inflammatory markers and levels of mRNA transcripts of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets were determined monthly. RESULTS: None of the participants exhibited changes in weight or body composition after study completion. EPA and DHA supplementation improved metabolic (insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR], triglyceride [TG]/ high-density lipoprotein [HDL] ratio, TG, and arachidonic acid [AA]/EPA ratio) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Moreover, the levels of mRNA transcripts of T CD4+ lymphocyte subsets (TBX21, IFNG, GATA-3, interleukin [IL]-4, FOXP3, IL-10 IL-6, and TNF-α), were down-regulated during the intervention phase. After 1 month without supplementation, only insulin, HOMA-IR and the mRNA transcripts remained low, whereas all other markers returned to their levels before supplementation. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with high-dose omega-3 FAs could modulate metabolism and inflammation in patients with obesity without weight loss or changes in body composition. However, these modulatory effects were ephemeral and with clear differential effects: short-duration on metabolism and long-lasting on inflammation."

Browning of white fat (white adipocytes transforming to beige adipocytes) offers an attractive approach for obesity treatment. In the present study, aptamer-functionalized nanogel of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), termed Apt-NG, was developed as the targeted delivery vehicle of browning agent docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Apt-NG has multiple advantages, including nanoscale size, strong autofluorescence, low toxicity, and excellent targeting capability to white adipocytes. After treatment with DHA@Apt-NG, the morphology of lipid droplets changed evidently; meanwhile the triglyceride level decreased while the mitochondrial activity increased. The DHA@Apt-NG treatment effectively up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of Ucp1, Pgc-1α, Pparg, and Prdm16, which play important roles in browning of white adipocytes. This study provides a feasible strategy to achieve efficient browning of white adipocytes based on targeted delivery nanosystems, inspiring a new idea for obesity treatment.",

Knowledge as to whether the type and concentrations of α-linolenic acid (ALA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the diet can make a difference to the birds' immune responses when subjected to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge is limited. OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to determine the potential nutritional and health benefits to laying hens when receiving dietary omega-3 PUFA from either ALA or DHA. METHODS: A total of 80 Lohmann LSL-Classic (white egg layer, 20 wk old) were randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment diets (10 hens/treatment), provided 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, or 0.8% of total dietary omega-3 PUFA, provided as either ALA-rich flaxseed oil or DHA-enriched algal biomass. After an 8-wk feeding period, the birds were challenged with Escherichia coli-derived LPS (8 mg/kg; i.v. injection), with terminal sample collection 4 h after challenge. Egg yolk, plasma, liver, and spleen samples were collected for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Increasing dietary omega-3 supplementation yielded predictable responses in egg yolk, plasma, and liver fatty acid concentrations. Dietary intake of ALA contributed mainly to ALA-derived oxylipins. Meanwhile, eicosapentaenoic acid- and DHA-derived oxylipins were primarily influenced by DHA dietary intake. LPS increased the concentrations of almost all the omega-6 PUFA-, ALA-, and DHA-derived oxylipins in plasma and decreased hepatic mRNA expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX (P < 0.001) involved in the biosynthesis of oxylipins. LPS also increased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and receptor TLR-4 (P < 0.001) in the spleen. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that dietary intake of ALA and DHA had unique impacts on fatty acid deposition and their derived oxylipins and inflammatory responses under the administration of LPS in laying hens.",

We selected TE-1 and TE-10 esophagus cancer cells as models and performed routine cell proliferation assay and cloning assay to detect the impact of DHA combined with X-ray. We used cell cycle assay, lipid peroxidation assay, comet assay, and apoptosis assay to unearth the potential causes. We also launched a mouse transplanted tumor experiment to verify the synergetic effect of DHA and irradiation. Finally, a western blot assay was used to find a novel mechanism. As a result, DHA improved TE-1 and TE-10 radiosensitivity in vivo and in vitro. What's more, PPAR-γ expression increased due to the DHA supplement. Inhibiting PPAR-γ could attenuate benefits brought out by DHA somehow. Due to its explicit usage and convenience, DHA would serve as an adjuvant therapy before radiotherapy if the clinical trials indicated positive."

      "abstract": "In order to find a more effective way to obtain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) rich lipid from Schizochytrium sp., a widespread propionate wastewater (PW) is used. PW is a common industrial and domestic wastewater, and transforming it into valuable products is a potential treatment method. Schizochytrium sp. is a rapidly growing oleaginous organism, which has been used commercially for DHA production. Herein, PW is completely used for DHA production by Schizochytrium sp. by genetic engineering and fermentation optimization, which can alleviate the increasingly tense demand for water resources and environmental pollution caused by industrial wastewater. Firstly, the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) was overexpressed in Schizochytrium sp. to enhance the metabolism of propionate, then the engineered strain of overexpressed MCM (OMCM) can effectively use propionate. Then, the effects of PW with different concentration of propionate were investigated, and results showed that OMCM can completely replace clean water with PW containing 5 g L-1 propionate. Furthermore, in the fed-batch fermentation, the OMCM obtained the highest biomass of 113.4 g L-1 and lipid yield of 64.4 g L-1 in PW condition, which is 26.8% and 51.7% higher than that of wild type (WT) in PW condition. Moreover, to verify why overexpression of MCM can promote DHA and lipid accumulation, the comparative metabolomics, ATP production level, the antioxidant system, and the transcription of key genes were investigated. Results showed that ATP induced by PW condition could drive the synthesis of DHA, and remarkably improve the antioxidant capacity of cells by enhancing the carotenoids production. Therefore, PW can be used as an effective and economical substrate and water source for Schizochytrium sp. to accumulate biomass and DHA.",

      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could induce adverse birth outcomes by evoking inflammation. We investigated the effect and mechanism of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on LPS-induced placental inflammation and fetal growth restriction (FGR). In vivo, pregnant CD-1 mice were divided into four groups: Ctrl, DHA, LPS and DHA+LPS group. We found that DHA pretreatment reduced the incidence of FGR induced by LPS and activated the expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in placental tissue. Moreover, the LPS-induced increase of mRNA levels of Tnf-α, Il-6, Il-1β, Mip-2 and Kc in placental tissue was significantly attenuated by DHA pretreatment. A similar effect of DHA was observed in serum of pregnant mice and amniotic fluid. In contrast, the levels of the IL-10 were significantly increased after DHA pretreatment. In vitro, we clarified that DHA antagonized the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway induced by LPS, which was dependent on PPARγ. Subsequently, CHX (translation inhibitor) was used to indicated that PPARγ significantly increased the degradation rate of p65, an effect that was inhibited by MG132 (proteasome inhibitor) treatment. Finally, it was confirmed that the activation of PPARγ could significantly promote the ubiquitination and degradation of p65. Our results suggested that DHA alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory responses and FGR by activating PPARγ expression, leading to p65 ubiquitination and degradation.",

      "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lessens adipose tissue lipid deposition partly by inducing adipocyte apoptosis in grass carp, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) is the novel pathway for inducing apoptosis. This study aimed to explore the potential role of ER stress in DHA-induced apoptosis in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) adipocytes. DHA induced apoptosis by deforming the nuclear envelope, condensing the chromatin, and increasing the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and genes in vivo and in vitro (P < 0.05). However, the ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), effectively suppressed DHA-induced apoptosis (P < 0.05), indicating that ER stress mediates DHA-induced adipocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed that 200 μM DHA significantly up-regulates the transcripts of B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) related ovarian killer (BOK) in vitro (P < 0.05). BOK is a pro-apoptotic protein in the BCL-2 family, which governs the mitochondria apoptosis pathway. Hence, we hypothesized that BOK might be an important linker between ER stress and apoptosis. We cloned and identified two grass carp BOK genes, BOKa and BOKb, which encode peptides of 213 and 216 amino acids, respectively. BOKa primarily localizes in ER and mitochondria in the cytoplasm, while BOKb localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasm of grass carp adipocytes. Moreover, 200 μM DHA treatment up-regulated the mRNA expression of BOKa and BOKb, whereas 4-PBA suppressed the DHA-induced expressions. These results raised the possibility that BOK participates in DHA-induced adipocyte apoptosis through ER stress signaling, in line with its localization in ER and mitochondria. Two UPR branches, the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) signaling pathways, are possibly important in DHA-induced adipocyte apoptosis, unlike protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase. The study also emphasized the roles of BOKa and BOKb in IRE1α- and ATF6-mediated apoptosis. This work is the first to elucidate the importance of the ER stress-BOK pathway during adipocyte apoptosis in teleost.",

      "abstract": "Drug resistance is a well-known and significant obstacle in the battle against cancer, rendering chemotherapy treatments often ineffective. To improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy, researchers are exploring the use of natural molecules that can enhance its ability to kill cancer cells and limit their spread. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a lipid found in marine fish, has been shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of various anti-cancer drugs in vitro and in vivo. While the combined use of chemotherapeutic drugs with DHA demonstrated promising preliminary results in clinical trials, there is still a significant amount of information to be discovered regarding the precise mechanism of action of DHA. As the biological pathways involved in the chemosensitization of already chemoresistant MCF-7 cells are still not entirely unraveled, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether DHA co-treatment could enhance the ability of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin to inhibit the growth and invasion of MCF-7 breast cancer cells (MCF-7/Dox) that had become resistant to the drug. Upon treating MCF-7/Dox cells with DHA or DHA-doxorubicin, it was observed that the DHA-doxorubicin combination effectively enhanced cancer cell death by impeding in vitro propagation and invasive ability. In addition, it led to an increase in doxorubicin accumulation and triggered apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Other observed effects included a decrease in the multi-drug resistance (MDR) carrier P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and TG2, a tumor survival factor. Augmented quantities of molecules promoting apoptosis such as Bak1 and caspase-3 and enhanced lipid peroxidation were also detected. Our findings in the cell model suggest that DHA can be further investigated as a natural compound to be used alongside doxorubicin in the treatment of breast cancer that is unresponsive to chemotherapy.",

We sought to assess whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation in GDM affects neonatal metabolic health biomarkers especially leptin and adiponectin. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, singleton pregnant women with de novo diagnosis of GDM at 24-28  weeks of gestation were randomized to dietary supplementation of 500 mg DHA per day (intervention, n = 30) until delivery or standard care (control, n = 38). The primary outcomes were cord blood leptin and total adiponectin concentrations. Secondary outcomes included high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations in cord blood, maternal glycemic control post-intervention and birth weight (z score). In parallel, 38 euglycemic pregnant women were recruited for comparisons of cord blood biomarkers. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in cord serum leptin, total and HMW adiponectin and IGF-1 concentrations between DHA supplementation and control groups (all p > 0.05). Maternal fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose levels at 12-16 weeks post-intervention were similar between the two groups. The newborns in the DHA group had higher birth weight z scores (p = 0.02). Cord blood total and HMW adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower in GDM vs. euglycemic pregnancies. CONCLUSION: Docosahexaenoic acid supplementation at 500  mg/day in GDM women did not affect neonatal metabolic biomarkers including leptin, adiponectin and IGF-1. The results are reassuring in light of the absence of influence on neonatal adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), and potential benefits to fetal growth and development.

Results showed that enzymatic treatment improved the incorporation of EPA/DHA as diacylglycerol (DG) while silica gel column chromatography enriched the content of EPA/DHA as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (12.58%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (4.99%). Furthermore, increasing the purity of EPA/DHA could improve its bioavailability and after 24 incubation, binding forms of triglyceride (TG) was superior to ethyl ester (EE) (p < 0.05) at the same purity level. Those findings are helpful to provide research basis for exploring the bioactivity of fish oil."

      "abstract": "High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are known to enhance vascular function through different mechanisms, including the delivery of functional lipids to endothelial cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that omega-3 (n-3) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content of HDLs would improve the beneficial vascular effects of these lipoproteins. To explore this hypothesis, we performed a placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial in 18 hypertriglyceridemic patients without clinical symptoms of coronary heart disease who received highly purified EPA 460 mg and DHA 380 mg, twice a day for 5 weeks or placebo. After 5 weeks of treatment, patients followed a 4-week washout period before crossover. HDLs were isolated using sequential ultracentrifugation for characterization and determination of fatty acid content. Our results showed that n-3 supplementation induced a significant decrease in body mass index, waist circumference as well as triglycerides and HDL-triglyceride plasma concentrations, whilst HDL-cholesterol and HDL-phospholipids significantly increased. On the other hand, HDL, EPA, and DHA content increased by 131% and 62%, respectively, whereas 3 omega-6 fatty acids significantly decreased in HDL structures. In addition, the EPA-to-arachidonic acid (AA) ratio increased more than twice within HDLs suggesting an improvement in their anti-inflammatory properties. All HDL-fatty acid modifications did not affect the size distribution or the stability of these lipoproteins and were concomitant with a significant increase in endothelial function assessed using a flow-mediated dilatation test (FMD) after n-3 supplementation. However, endothelial function was not improved in vitro using a model of rat aortic rings co-incubated with HDLs before or after treatment with n-3. These results suggest a beneficial effect of n-3 on endothelial function through a mechanism independent of HDL composition. In conclusion, we demonstrated that EPA and DHA supplementation for 5 weeks improved vascular function in hypertriglyceridemic patients, and induced enrichment of HDLs with EPA and DHA to the detriment of some n-6 fatty acids. The significant increase in the EPA-to-AA ratio in HDLs is indicative of a more anti-inflammatory profile of these lipoproteins.",

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of 17-oxo-DHA on ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and carcinogenesis in mouse skin. UVB-induced epidermal cell death was ameliorated by topically applied 17-oxo-DHA. Topical application of 17-oxo-DHA onto hairless mouse skin inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of the proinflammatory transcription factor, STAT3 on tyrosine 705 (Tyr705). The 17-oxo-DHA treatment also reduced the levels of oxidative stress markers, 4-hydroxynonenal-modified protein, malondialdehyde, and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine. The protective effects of 17-oxo-DHA against oxidative damage in UVB-irradiated mouse skin were associated with activation of Nrf2. 17-Oxo-DHA enhanced the engulfment of apoptotic JB6 cells by macrophages, which was related to the increased expression of the scavenger receptor CD36. The 17-oxo-DHA-mediated potentiation of efferocytic activity of macrophages was attenuated by the pharmacologic inhibition or knockout of Nrf2. The pretreatment with 17-oxo-DHA reduced the UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis and tumor angiogenesis. It was also confirmed that 17-oxo-DHA treatment significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of the Tyr705 residue of STAT3 and decreased the expression of its target proteins in cutaneous papilloma. In conclusion, 17-oxo-DHA protects against UVB-induced oxidative cell death, dermatitis, and carcinogenesis. These effects were associated with inhibition of STAT3-mediated proinflammatory signaling and also activation of Nrf2 with subsequent upregulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory gene expression.",

It remains unclear if supranutritional levels of DHA and calcidiol impair growth performance or metabolism of broiler chickens. This study was to determine singular and combined effects of high levels of supplemental DHA-rich microalgal biomass or oil and calcidiol on growth performance, concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, and nonesterfied fatty acids in plasma, liver, breast, and thigh, and biophysical properties of tibia. METHODS: In Exp. 1, 144 day-old Cornish chicks were divided into 4 groups (6 cages/treatment, 6 birds/cage), and were fed a corn-soybean meal basal diet (BD), BD + 10,000 IU calcidiol/kg (BD + Cal), BD + 1% DHA-rich Aurantiochytrium (1.2 g DHA/kg; BD + DHA), and BD + Cal + DHA for 6 weeks. In Exp. 2, 180 day-old chicks were divided into 5 groups, and were fed: BD, BD + DHA (0.33% to 0.66% oil, 1.5 to 3.0 g DHA/kg), BD + DHA + EPA (1.9% to 3.8% eicosapentaenoic acid-rich Nannochloropsis sp.

RESULTS: Birds fed BD + Cal diet in Exp. 1 and BD + DHA + EPA diet in Exp. 2 had higher (P < 0.05) body weight gain (10%-11%) and gain:feed ratio (7%), and lower (P < 0.05) total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in plasma (18%-54%), liver (8%-26%), breast (19%-26%), and thigh (10%-19%), respectively, over the controls. The two diets also improved (P < 0.05) tibial breaking strength (8%-24%), total bone volume (2%-13%), and (or) bone mineral density (3%-19%) of chickens. CONCLUSION: Supranutrition of dietary calcidiol and DHA alone or together did not produce adverse effects, but led to moderate improvements of growth performance, lipid profiles of plasma and muscle, and bone properties of broiler chickens."

After the four weeks, 20 fish in each treatment were randomly selected and injected with a mixture of 500 mg D-GalN and 10 μL LPS per mL to induce acute liver injury. The results showed that the Nile tilapia fed on DHA diets decreased visceral somatic index, liver lipid content and serum and liver triglyceride concentrations than those fed on the Con diet. Moreover, after D-GalN/LPS injection, the fish fed on DHA diets decreased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase activities in the serum. The results of liver qPCR and transcriptomics assays together showed that the DHA diets feeding improved liver health by downregulating the expression of the genes related to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, inflammation and apoptosis. This study indicates that DHA supplementation in Nile tilapia alleviates the liver damage caused by D-GalN/LPS through increasing lipid catabolism, decreasing lipogenesis, TLR4 signaling pathway, inflammation, and apoptosis. Our study provides novel knowledge on the role of DHA in improving liver health in cultured aquatic animals for sustainable aquaculture.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Mitochondria-targeted anticancer drugs (\"mitocans\") of natural origin are attractive candidates as adjuvants in cancer therapy. The redox couple menadione/ascorbate (M/A), which belongs to the \"mitocans\" family, induces selective oxidative stress in cancerous mitochondria and cells, respectively. DHA has also been found to regulate the mevalonate pathway, which is closely related to the prenylation of the cytotoxic menadione to the non-cytotoxic menaquinone. The aim of this study was to elucidate the ability of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to potentiate the anticancer effect of M/A by increasing ROS production, as well as affecting steady-state ATP levels in cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiments were performed on leukemic lymphocyte Jurkat. Cells were treated with DHA, M/A, and their combination (M/A/DHA) and four parameters were examined using the following assays: cell viability and proliferation, steady-state ATP, mitochondrial superoxide, intracellular hydroperoxides. Three independent experiments with two or six parallel measurements were performed for each parameter. RESULTS: The triple combination M/A/DHA was characterized by much higher antiproliferative activity and cytotoxicity than M/A and DHA administered alone. DHA significantly accelerated M/A-induced ATP depletion in cells, which was accompanied by an additional increase in mitochondrial superoxide compared to cells treated with M/A or DHA alone. CONCLUSION: DHA significantly enhanced M/A-induced cytotoxicity in leukemic lymphocytes by inducing severe mitochondrial oxidative stress and accelerated ATP depletion. Selective DHA-mediated suppression of cholesterol synthesis in cancer cells (involved in the prenylation of cytotoxic menadione to the less cytotoxic phylloquinone), as well as DHA-mediated inhibition of superoxide dismutase are suggested to underlie the potentiation of the anticancer effect of M/A.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic, and heterogeneous mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world population. Ongoing research aims at clustering schizophrenia heterogeneity into various \"biotypes\" to identify subgroups of individuals displaying homogeneous symptoms, etiopathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment response. The present study is in line with this approach and focuses on a biotype partly characterized by a specific membrane lipid composition. We have examined clinical and biological data of patients with stabilized schizophrenia, including the fatty acid content of their erythrocyte membranes, in particular the omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Two groups of patients of similar size were identified: the DHA- group (N = 19) with a lower proportion of membrane DHA as compared to the norm in the general population, and the DHAn group (N = 18) with a normal proportion of DHA. Compared to DHAn, DHA- patients had a higher number of hospitalizations and a lower quality of life in terms of perceived health and physical health. They also exhibited significant higher interleukin-6 and cortisol blood levels. These results emphasize the importance of measuring membrane lipid and immunoinflammatory biomarkers in stabilized patients to identify a specific subgroup and optimize non-pharmacological interventions. It could also guide future research aimed at proposing specific pharmacological treatments."

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neuromuscular ailment that affects people in their later years and causes both motor and non-motor deficits. Receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP-1) is a critical participant in necroptotic cell death, possibly through an oxidant-antioxidant imbalance and cytokine cascade activation in PD pathogenesis. The present study examined the role of RIP-1-mediated necroptosis and neuroinflammation in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model, as well as their protection by Necrostatin-1s (an RIP signalling inhibitor), antioxidant DHA and their functional interaction. BALB/c mice were given acute MPTP therapy (4 injections of 15 mg/kg i.p. at 2-h intervals) on day 1. After MPTP intoxication, Necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s; 8 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and DHA (300 mg/kg/day, p.o.) treatments were given once daily for 7 days. The Nec-1s treatment prevented MPTP-induced behavioural, biochemical and neurochemical alterations, and the addition of DHA increases Nec-1s' neuroprotective impact. In addition, Nec-1s and DHA significantly improve the survival of TH-positive dopaminergic neurons and lower expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α. Furthermore, Nec-1s dramatically reduced RIP-1 expression, whereas DHA had little effect. Our research raises the possibility that neuroinflammatory signalling and acute MPTP-induced necroptosis are both mediated by TNFR1-driven RIP-1 activity. In this study, RIP-1 ablation through Nec-1s and the addition of DHA showed a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory and oxidative markers, as well as protection from MPTP-driven dopaminergic degeneration and neurobehavioural changes, suggesting potential therapeutic applications. For a better understanding, additional research about the mechanism(s) behind Nec-1s and DHA is required.",
