      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating how water, sanitation, and/or handwashing (WASH) interventions in low- and middle-income countries impact diarrheal diseases have shown inconsistent results. The prevalence of enteric pathogen infections and diarrhea are highly seasonal and climate-sensitive, which could explain heterogeneous findings. Understanding how season influences the effectiveness of WASH interventions is critical for informing intervention approaches that will be resistant under the varying weather conditions that climate change will bring. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis to test whether and to what extent the impact of WASH interventions on diarrhea differs by season. We searched the literature for randomized and nonrandomized controlled WASH intervention trials and identified the season in which data were collected-rainy, dry, or both-for each study using proximate land station weather datasets. We compared the relative risk (RR) estimates for the impact of interventions on diarrhea for each study, stratified by season, and analyzed estimates using meta-analysis and meta-regression. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021231137. RESULTS: A total of 50 studies met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 34 drinking water intervention estimates, 8 sanitation intervention estimates, and 14 handwashing intervention estimates. Of the total studies, 60% (n=30) spanned more than one season, with most single-season studies (75%, n=15) occurring exclusively in the dry season. The effect of WASH interventions was stronger in dry seasons than in rainy seasons, with a 33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 24%, 41%] and 18% reduction (95% CI: 5%, 29%) in diarrhea risk, respectively. When stratified by type of intervention, the stronger effect size in dry seasons was consistent for water and handwashing interventions but not for sanitation interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the seasonal impact of WASH interventions revealed larger effects in the dry season than in the rainy season overall and for water and handwashing interventions in particular. These patterns likely affected previous estimates of intervention effectiveness, which included more dry season estimates. These findings suggest the need to collect data across seasons and report seasonally stratified results to allow for more accurate estimates of the burden of disease impacted by WASH investments and to improve projections of potential impacts of these interventions under future climate conditions. These findings also underscore the need for robust WASH interventions designed to be resistant to seasonal variations in temperature and rainfall now and under future climate change scenarios. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP14502.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotics can trigger antimicrobial resistance and microbiome alterations. Reducing pathogen exposure and undernutrition can reduce infections and antibiotic use. We assess effects of water, sanitation, handwashing (WSH) and nutrition interventions on caregiver-reported antibiotic use in Bangladesh and Kenya, longitudinally measured at three timepoints among birth cohorts (ages 3-28 months) in a cluster-randomized trial. Over 50% of children used antibiotics at least once in the 90 days preceding data collection. In Bangladesh, the prevalence of antibiotic use was 10-14% lower in groups receiving WSH (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.90 (0.82-0.99)), nutrition (PR = 0.86 (0.78-0.94)), and nutrition+WSH (PR = 0.86 (0.79-0.93)) interventions. The prevalence of using antibiotics multiple times was 26-35% lower in intervention arms. Reductions were largest when the birth cohort was younger. In Kenya, interventions did not affect antibiotic use. In this work, we show that improving WSH and nutrition can reduce antibiotic use. Studies should assess whether such reductions translate to reduced antimicrobial resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Very few studies have used panel data regression models to estimate the determinants of handwashing with water and soap at critical times in a developing country. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the predictors of handwashing with water and soap at critical times among mother/caregivers of children under-5 years in rural Afghanistan. METHOD: This study used data from 1208 mothers/caregivers of children under-5 years who were selected and interviewed at baseline and endline in 7 provinces using systematic probability proportional-to-size sampling method. RESULTS: Mother/caregivers with access to handwashing facility with water and soap had 1.20 higher odds of washing hands at 5 critical times. Treatment at public facility, an indirect proxy of health education and having children under 2 years was associated with 1.07 and 1.05 higher odds of washing hands at 5 critical times. Access to handwashing with water and soap, treatment at public facility and children under 2 years were significant and robust to alternative specification of handwashing at least 3 times. Mothers/caregivers who reported contracting infectious diseases in the past 6 months had 1.04- and 1.52-times higher odds of handwashing at 5 critical times and at least 3 times respectively. CONCLUSION: Access to handwashing facility with water and soap, health education, children under 2 years and occurrence of infectious diseases were the predictors of appropriate handwashing behaviour. Therefore, there is need to improve the availability of handwashing facilities with clean water and soap to promote appropriate handwashing behaviour at critical times. In addition, there is need to promote activities that increase disposable income for households to purchase soap and handwashing facilities. There is need to promote healthcare seeking behaviour for mothers to access medical treatment and health hygiene education at public facilities vital for prevention of infectious diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Besides the high prevalence of HIV and HCV infections, people who inject drugs (PWID) have a cumulative risk of acquiring skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) from, among other things, social precariousness, homelessness/unstable housing, and unhygienic injecting practices. We propose to evaluate whether a two-component educational hand hygiene intervention which combines training in hand-washing with the supply of a single-use alcohol-based hand rub, called MONO-RUB, is effective in reducing injection-related abscesses in the PWID population. Specifically, we shall implement a nationwide, two-arm, multi-centre, cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this intervention in PWID. METHODS: HAWA is a community-based participatory research study to be conducted in 22 harm reduction centres (HR) in France (not yet recruiting); the latter will be randomised into two clusters: centres providing standard HR services and the intervention (i.e., intervention group) and those providing standard HR services only (i.e., control group). After randomization, each cluster will include 220 PWID, with an inclusion period of 12 months and an individual follow-up period of 6 months. For each participant, we will collect data at M0, M3 and M6 from photos of injection sites on the participant's body, a face-to-face injection-related SSTI questionnaire, and a CATI questionnaire. The primary outcome is the reduction in abscess prevalence between M0 and M6, which will be compared between the control and intervention arms, and measured from observed (photographs) and self-declared (SSTI questionnaire) data. We will also assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The HAWA trial will be the first cluster randomized controlled trial to improve hand hygiene among PWID with a view to reducing SSTI. If effective and cost-effective, the intervention combined with the distribution of MONO-RUBs (or a similar cleaning product) may prove to be an important HR tool, helping to reduce the enormous burden of infection-related deaths and diseases in PWID.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Orphaned children are often deprived of quality care, making them more susceptible to diseases due to inadequate hand hygiene. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of hand hygiene practices and detect bacterial loads on children's hands before and after hygiene interventions in an orphanage school. METHODS: The study enrolled all the orphan children registered with the Save Our Souls children's orphanage school in Pakistan. Handwashing practices and swab samples from the hand was collected to evaluate the impact of hand hygiene practices on bacterial load. The Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment model was used to predict the health risk. RESULTS: The study identified the 2 most common bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The bacterial contamination was significantly reduced after the intervention (S aureus 166 Colony-forming unit (CFU) /mL and E coli 185 CFU/mL). The higher bacterial ingestion rate was attributed to hand contamination and increased bacteria transfer from hand to mouth. CONCLUSIONS: The multicomponent hand hygiene intervention showed improvement in accessibility to hand hygiene resources and practices. The findings underscore the need for hygiene interventions in orphanage schools to improve health and educational outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Healthcare-acquired infections are a major problem in healthcare facility settings around the world. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has over 2 million diarrhea patients hospitalized each year. These healthcare settings become high-risk environments for spreading diarrheal illnesses such as cholera. The objective of the Preventative Intervention for Cholera for 7 Days (PICHA7) program is to develop evidence-based water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions to reduce cholera and other severe diarrheal diseases in the DRC. The study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of PICHA7 program delivery in increasing handwashing with a cleansing agent at stool/vomit- and food-related events in a healthcare facility setting among diarrhea patients and patient attendants. A pilot of the PICHA7 program was conducted among 284 participants in 27 healthcare facilities from March 2020 to November 2021 in urban Bukavu in the South Kivu Province of the DRC. The standard arm received the standard message provided in the DRC to diarrhea patients on the use of oral rehydration solution and a basic WASH message at healthcare facility discharge. The PICHA7 arm received the PICHA7 WASH pictorial module delivered by a health promoter focused on handwashing with a cleansing agent at the bedside of the diarrhea patient in the healthcare facility and provision of a soapy water bottle (water and detergent powder). Within 24 h of intervention delivery, a three-hour structured observation of handwashing practices at stool/vomit- and food-related events (key events) was conducted in healthcare facilities of diarrhea patients and their attendants. Compared to the standard arm, there was significantly more handwashing with a cleansing agent at key events in the PICHA7 arm (40% vs. 15%) (odds ratio: 5.04; (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.01, 12.7)). These findings demonstrate that delivery of the PICHA7 WASH pictorial module and provision of a soapy water bottle to diarrhea patients and their attendants presents a promising approach to increase handwashing with a cleansing agent among this high-risk population in healthcare facilities in the eastern DRC.",

      "abstract": "Handwashing is an effective public health intervention for preventing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Maintenance of clean hands is particularly important during the pandemic, to break the cycle of human-to-human transmission of the virus. This study explored the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the handwashing behaviours of residents before and during the pandemic. A mixed-method cross-sectional design using standardised questionnaire was used to examine hand handwashing behaviours among residents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the middle belt of Ghana. However, this paper reports on the quantitative data on handwashing behaviour only. A total of 517 participants between 18 to 60 years were randomly selected from the Kintampo Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) database. Descriptive statistics were performed and McNamar test was used to estimate the difference in the handwashing behaviour of residents. Majority of the respondents were females (54.6%). The majority of them 77.0% (398) usually wash their hands with soap and water. Those who washed hands 4 to 6 times a day before the pandemic increased from 39.9% (159) to 43.7% (174). About 34.8% (180) had received training on hand washing and television 53.3% (96) emerged as the main source of training. Ownership of handwashing facilities increased from 11.4% (59) to 22.8% (118) during the pandemic. The odds of handwashing after handshaking were lower 0.64 (95% C1: 0.44-0.92,) during the pandemic. Television (53.3%) was the main source of training for respondents who had received training on handwashing (34.8%). The odds of owning a handwashing facility during the pandemic were 3 times higher than before (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.94 - 4.65). The odds of handwashing after sneezing were 1.8 (95% CI: 1.19-2.92) times higher during the pandemic. Handwashing behaviours during the pandemic improved among residents than before. However, there is a need to intensify health education and media engagement on proper handwashing practices to protect the population against infectious diseases.",

We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in rural Bangladesh (funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01590095) to assess the effects of an integrated nutritional, water, sanitation, and handwashing intervention on child health. We previously reported on the primary outcomes of the trial, linear growth and caregiver-reported diarrhea. Here, we assessed additional prespecified outcomes: physiological stress response, oxidative stress, and DNA methylation (N = 759, ages 1-2 years). Eight neighboring pregnant women were grouped into a study cluster. Eight geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomized into the control or the combined nutrition, water, sanitation, and handwashing (N + WSH) intervention group (receiving nutritional counseling and lipid-based nutrient supplements, chlorinated drinking water, upgraded sanitation, and handwashing with soap). Participants and data collectors were not masked, but analyses were masked. There were 358 children (68 clusters) in the control group and 401 children (63 clusters) in the intervention group. We measured four F2-isoprostanes isomers (iPF(2α)-III; 2,3-dinor-iPF(2α)-III; iPF(2α)-VI; 8,12-iso-iPF(2α)-VI), salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol, and methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) exon 1F promoter including the NGFI-A binding site. Compared with control, the N + WSH group had lower concentrations of F2-isoprostanes isomers (differences ranging from -0.16 to -0.19 log ng/mg of creatinine, P < 0.01), elevated post-stressor cortisol (0.24 log µg/dl; P < 0.01), higher cortisol residualized gain scores (0.06 µg/dl; P = 0.023), and decreased methylation of the NGFI-A binding site (-0.04; P = 0.037). The N + WSH intervention enhanced adaptive responses of the physiological stress system in early childhood.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality globally. Household water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) interventions can reduce exposure to diarrhea-causing pathogens, but meteorological factors may impact their effectiveness. Information about effect heterogeneity under different weather conditions is critical to refining these targeted interventions. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether temperature and precipitation modified the effect of low-cost, point-of-use WASH interventions on child diarrhea. METHODS: We analyzed data from a trial in rural Bangladesh that compared child diarrhea prevalence between clusters (N=720) that were randomized to different WASH interventions between 2012 and 2016 (NCT01590095). We matched temperature and precipitation measurements to diarrhea outcomes (N=12,440 measurements, 6,921 children) by geographic coordinates and date. We estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) using generative additive models and targeted maximum likelihood estimation to assess the effectiveness of each WASH intervention under different weather conditions. RESULTS: Generally, WASH interventions most effectively prevented diarrhea during monsoon season, particularly following weeks with heavy rain or high temperatures. The PR for diarrhea in the WASH interventions group compared with the control group was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.68) after 1 d of heavy rainfall, with a less-protective effect [PR=0.87 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.25)] when there were no days with heavy rainfall. Similarly, the PR for diarrhea in the WASH intervention group compared with the control group was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.75) following above-median temperatures vs. 0.91 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.35) following below-median temperatures. The influence of precipitation and temperature varied by intervention type; for precipitation, the largest differences in effectiveness were for the sanitation and combined WASH interventions. DISCUSSION: WASH intervention effectiveness was strongly influenced by precipitation and temperature, and nearly all protective effects were observed during the rainy season. Future implementation of these interventions should consider local environmental conditions to maximize effectiveness, including targeted efforts to maintain latrines and promote community adoption ahead of monsoon seasons. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13807.",

      "abstract": "Wash'Em is a process that supports humanitarians in assessing and designing rapid but context-specific hygiene programmes in crises or outbreaks. The process consists of training implementers, using tools to learn from populations, and entering findings into a software which generates contextualised activities. A process evaluation of Wash'Em use was conducted in a drought-affected area in Midland province, Zimbabwe. Data were collected during the programme design and following implementation using a mix of qualitative methods. Findings were classified against the intended stages of Wash'Em, and the evaluation domains were defined by the UKRI Medical Research Council. The Wash'Em process was not fully implemented as intended. An abridged training was utilised, some of the tools for learning from populations were omitted, many of the recommended activities were not implemented, the delivery modalities were different from intended, the budget available was minimal, and the number of people exposed to activities were fewer than hoped. Despite these 'on the ground' challenges and adaptations, the Wash'Em process was considered feasible by implementers and was seen to be less top-down than most programme design approaches. The populations exposed to the intervention found the activities engaging, understood the content, and reportedly took action to improve handwashing behaviour. Programmes such as Wash'Em, which facilitate community participation and are underpinned by theory and evidence, are likely to yield positive results even if processes are followed imperfectly.",

This study evaluates culturally relevant educational resources as a vehicle to disseminate the importance of handwashing amongst children in India. Employing a participatory action research (PAR) model and mixed methods, this follow-up longitudinal study evaluates a set of innovate educational handwashing resources and workshops specifically co-created for use in the State of Gujarat, and how they aid teachers in the teaching of hand-hygiene over a 3 year period. Working alongside local NGOs on-the-ground, teacher questionnaires (n=58) and focus groups including a brief questionnaire with teachers (n=35) were conducted to assess the impact of trainer workshops. In addition, pre- and post-workshop worksheets were conducted with children (n=98). Percentage change was calculated between children's pre-and post-worksheet scores and a cumulative frequency of responses to each questionnaire criterion was measured. Data from the focus group found that the resources had been used in over 200 schools by more than 5000 children. In addition, 92.28 % of teachers said they would use the resources within their classrooms in India, with 58.16 % of pupils having an increased understanding of germs/handwashing directly after the workshop. Teachers reported that they are able to teach microbiology and handwashing more effectively. Furthermore, following a focus group, 100 % of teachers noted a reduction in childhood vomiting and diarrhoeal illnesses linked with insufficient hand-hygiene across 46 schools in the State of Gujarat since using the Germ's Journey resources."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cholera can result in the expulsion of important microbiota from the gut and result in death if left untreated. The disease transmits mainly via drinking water carrying Vibrio cholerae; and household contacts (HHC) of cholera patients are at elevated risk during the first week of infection. The gut microbiota profiles of HHC-children of cholera patients at Dhaka city slums were investigated before (day 0) and after (day 8) delivery of chlorinated water as part of the major study 'CHoBI7 trial (cholera-hospital-based intervention for 7 days)'. RESULT: Results of sequencing and analysis of bacterial community DNA revealed the predominance of two bacterial phyla: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes at day 0 with a relative abundance of 62 ± 6 (mean ± SEM%) and 32 ± 7, respectively. The pattern reversed at day 8 with a decreased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (39 ± 12; p = 0.034) and an increased abundance of Firmicutes (49 ± 12; p = 0.057). Of 65 bacterial families confirmed at day 0, six belonging to Proteobacteria including Vibrionaceae disappeared at day 8. Interestingly, the relative abundance of four Firmicutes families-Lachnospiraceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Ruminococcaceae was increased in all five study children at day 8. CONCLUSION: The observed exclusion of pathogenic Proteobacteria and enhancement of beneficial Firmicutes in the gut of children delivered with chlorinated water as part of WASH intervention reflect a great promise of the CHoBI7 program in preventing cholera and improving child health.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Increasing handwashing with soap (HWWS) among older children in emergency settings can have a large public health impact, however, evidence on what works is limited. One promising approach is the 'Surprise Soap' intervention in which a novel soap with an embedded toy is delivered to children in a short, participatory household session that includes a glitter game and HWWS practice. Here, we evaluate this intervention against a standard intervention in a complex emergency setting. METHODS: A cluster-randomised controlled equivalence trial was conducted in Naivasha refugee settlement, Sudan. Blinding was not possible. 203 randomly selected households, with at least one child aged 5-12, were randomised to receive the Surprise Soap intervention (n=101) or a standard intervention comprising a short household session with health messaging and plain soap distribution (n=102). The primary outcome was the proportion of prespecified potential HWWS events observed for children aged 5-12, accompanied by HWWS, at baseline, 4, 12 and 16 weeks post intervention delivery. RESULTS: 200 households were included in the analyses: 101 intervention and 99 control. No difference in intervention effectiveness was observed at any follow-up (4 weeks: adjusted rate ratio (RR) 1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.7; 12 weeks: RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.1; 16 weeks: RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5). However, we observed increased HWWS in both arms at 4 weeks (27 and 23 percentage point increase in the intervention and control arm, respectively) that was sustained at 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the Surprise Soap intervention is no more effective at increasing older children's HWWS than a standard, household-level, health-based intervention in this complex humanitarian emergency. There appears to be no marginal benefit in terms of HWWS that would justify the additional cost of implementing the Surprise Soap intervention. Further trials that include a passive control arm are needed to determine the independent effects of each intervention and guide future intervention design.",

      "abstract": "Improvement in hand hygiene has been strongly associated with positive outcomes in maternal and child health. Although Bangladesh has a high level of awareness of key hygiene messages, the practice of handwashing, the most effective hygiene behavior, is low. Suchana, a multisectoral nutrition program, aims to increase knowledge and practices around various water, sanitation, and hygiene settings in Sylhet region, the northeast of rural Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the changes in indicators related to handwashing knowledge and practices among Suchana beneficiaries in final compared with baseline evaluations. Data were derived from the baseline and final cross-sectional evaluation survey. The following handwashing knowledge and practices were considered: handwashing before preparing food, before eating food and feeding children, before serving food, after defecation, and after touching animals. The descriptive findings indicate that Suchana intervention improved handwashing knowledge and practices in the intervention area compared with the control. The odds of having knowledge of hand washing before preparing food (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.30-1.98), before eating food and feeding children (aOR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.25-2.25), before serving food (aOR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.04-1.76), after defecation (aOR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.25-2.41), and after touching animals (aOR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.29-2.16) were higher in intervention area than the control area. Similarly, the impact on maternal handwashing practices at final evaluation indicated successful effects of the intervention. These results suggest scaling-up of similar interventions for larger populations living in vulnerable areas of rural Bangladesh.",

METHODS: The study included 38,554 children born in 2010 who were enrolled in a longitudinal study. Information on children's hygiene education regarding handwashing and gargling was collected in a survey at the age of 3.5 years. Based on parents' reports of doctors' diagnoses, airway infections and influenza events in the 12-month duration before the survey were evaluated for RTIs at the ages of 4.5 and 9 years. Poisson regression with robust variance was performed to examine the effects of hygiene education on RTIs prevention. The supplementary analysis was stratified by household income. RESULTS: Children were categorized into different groups: 38% in the handwashing and gargling group, 29% in the handwashing group, 0.1% in the gargling group, and 9.7% in the no-education group. Exclusions were made for non-respondent children (23%) and those in the gargling group. Hygiene education was associated with decreased influenza at the age of 4.5 years in the handwashing (adjusted RR [aRR] = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9) and handwashing and gargling groups (aRR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9) compared with no education. However, no preventive effects on airway infections at the age of 4.5 and 9, influenza at the age of 9, or hospitalization between the ages of 3.5 and 9 years were detected. Handwashing and gargling could significantly prevent influenza in low-income households (aRR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.8).     Conclusions: Gargling education was widespread and mostly combined with handwashing education in Japan. Hygiene education significantly affected prevention of influenza infections at the age of 4.5 years, especially in low-income households. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Previous intervention studies showed handwashing and gargling are effective in preventing respiratory tract infections. WHAT IS NEW: • We conducted a longitudinal study on handwashing and gargling education in Japanese children and found that handwashing and gargling were widely practiced together. • Handwashing and gargling education were related to a reduction in influenza, particularly in low-income households."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 3 billion people lack proper home hand hygiene facilities globally. Of these, 1.4 billion (18%) lack soap or water, while 1.6 billion (22%) have neither. This analysis explores the link between living conditions and the use of essential agents in sub-Saharan Africa. This secondary data analysis examines potential associations between the domiciliary environment and the use of essential agents in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Eighteen demographic and health surveys were used to analyze the association between household environmental factors and handwashing with essential agents. STATA version 16 was used to analyze data from 203,311 households across weighted samples. Using a multivariable multilevel mixed effect logistic regression analysis, it was possible to determine how each independent factor affected the outcome while taking the data clustering into account. The adjusted odds ratio and its associated 95% confidence interval were used to assess the independent factors' statistical significance. RESULT: Only one in three households 34.84%, practiced handwashing with essential agents, with the highest prevalence in Angola (70.2%) and the lowest in Malawi (6.5%). Educational status [aOR = 1.77; 95%(CI = 1.68-1.86)], female headship[aOR = 1.09; 95%(CI = 1.06-1.2)], household wealth[aOR = 4.08; 95%(CI = 3.84-4.33)], not sharing toilets with other homes[aOR = 1.13; 95%(CI = 1.10-1.17)], having a fixed place for hand washing[aOR = 1.49; 95%(CI = 1.45-1.54)], not having regular access to water [aOR = 0.09; 95%(CI = 0.095-0.10)]and being a rural resident [aOR = 0.85; 95%(CI = 0.82-0.88)] were associated with handwashing. CONCLUSION: sub-Saharan nations are failing to demonstrate advancements in handwashing practices. There are still a lot of homes without access to basic infrastructure for handwashing and household water sources. For essential agent adoption programs to be successful in an environment with limited resources, Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene measures must be implemented. Furthermore, it is critical to include contextual factors from the current study as well as socio-cultural and psychological characteristics that dissuade people from using essential agents in intervention strategies.",

Interventions promoting hand hygiene methods other than handwashing with soap were excluded, as were interventions in health-care facilities or the workplace. The primary outcome was ARI morbidity arising from any pathogen for participants of any age. Secondary outcomes were lower respiratory infection, upper respiratory infection, influenza confirmed by diagnostic test, COVID-19 confirmed by diagnostic test, and all-cause mortality. We extracted relative risks (RRs), using random-effects meta-analysis to analyse study results, and metaregression to evaluate heterogeneity. We assessed risk of bias in individual studies using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and assessed the overall body of evidence using a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021231414. FINDINGS: 26 studies with 161 659 participants met inclusion criteria, providing 27 comparisons (21 randomised). Interventions promoting handwashing with soap reduced any ARI compared with no handwashing intervention (RR 0·83 [95% CI 0·76-0·90], I2 88%; 27 comparisons). Interventions also reduced lower respiratory infections (0·78 [0·64-0·94], I2 64%; 12 comparisons) and upper respiratory infections (0·74 [0·59-0·93], I2 91%; seven comparisons), but not test-confirmed influenza (0·94 [0·42-2·11], I2 90%; three comparisons), test-confirmed COVID-19 (no comparisons), or all-cause mortality (prevalence ratio 0·95 [95% CI 0·71-1·27]; one comparison). For ARI, no heterogeneity covariates were significant at p<0·1 and the GRADE rating was moderate certainty evidence. INTERPRETATION: Interventions promoting handwashing with soap can reduce ARI in LMICs, and could help to prevent the large burden of respiratory disease.

      "abstract": "Handwashing with water and soap (HWWS) is an effective method of cleaning and disinfecting the surface of the hands. HWWS is effective in infection control and prevention transmission, such as in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, rates of handwashing compliance vary globally. This systematic review aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators to community HWWS globally. We conducted a comprehensive search strategy in OVID Medline, OVID Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus using keywords and subject headings related to handwashing. Studies were excluded if they reported hand hygiene among healthcare or food service workers, considered the use of alcohol rubs, or involved an intervention in a healthcare or food preparation setting. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, and data were extracted from the articles and analyzed using the Theoretical Domains Framework and inductive thematic analysis. The search strategy yielded a total of 11,696 studies, and 46 studies met the eligibility criteria. Study dates ranged from 2003 to 2020 and included 26 countries; the most frequently represented were Bangladesh, India, and Kenya. A total of 21 barriers and 23 facilitators to HWWS were identified and organized into the Theoretical Domains Framework. The most frequently cited domains were environmental context and resources, goals, and knowledge. Nine themes emerged from these barriers and facilitators: resource availability, cost and affordability, handwash station design and infrastructure, accessibility, gender roles, champions, health promotion, time management, and knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors. This review uncovered multiple barriers and facilitators around a determinant framework to observe and create an in-depth, multidimensional image of a community-based hand hygiene situation. New comprehensive interventions and implementation strategies can be developed using the findings to target the contextual barriers and facilitators to improve and increase HWWS rates. Stakeholders (i.e., practitioners, researchers, policymakers) can use the findings to revise, design, or evaluate new or existing projects, interventions, and policies to improve HWWS. Registration: A protocol for this systematic review was developed and uploaded onto the PROSPERO-International prospective register of systematic reviews database (Registration number: CRD42020221210)."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Improving handwashing with soap (HWWS) among children in humanitarian emergencies has the potential to reduce the transmission of several important infectious diseases. However, there is limited evidence on which approaches are effective in increasing HWWS among children in humanitarian settings. One recent innovation - the \"Surprise Soap\" intervention - was shown to be successful in a small-scale efficacy trial in a humanitarian setting in Iraq. This intervention includes soap with embedded toys delivered through a short household session comprising a glitter game, instruction of how and when to wash hands, and HWWS practice. Whilst promising, this approach has not been evaluated at programmatic scale in a complex humanitarian setting. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled equivalence trial of the Surprise Soap intervention in IDP camps in Kahda district, Somalia. Proportionate stratified random sampling was employed to recruit 200 households, with at least one child aged 5-12, across the camps. Eligible households were randomly allocated to receive the Surprise Soap intervention (n = 100) or an active comparator handwashing intervention in which plain soap was delivered in a short household session comprising standard health-based messaging and instruction of how and when to wash hands (n = 100). The primary outcome was the proportion of pre-specified occasions when HWWS was practiced by children aged 5-12 years, measured at baseline, 4-weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks post invention delivery. RESULTS: HWWS increased in both groups (by 48 percentage points in the intervention group and 51 percentage points in the control group, at the 4-week follow up), however, there was no evidence of a difference in HWWS between the groups at the 4-week (adjusted RR (aRR) = 1.0, 95% CI 0.9-1.1), 12-week (aRR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.9-1.3), or 16-week (aRR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.9-1.2) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this complex humanitarian setting, where soap availability and past exposure to handwashing promotion was low, it appears that well-designed, household-level targeted handwashing interventions that include soap provision can increase child HWWS and potentially reduce disease risk, but the Surprise Soap intervention offers no marginal benefit over a standard intervention that would justify the additional costs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing handwashing with soap (HWWS) among older children (aged 5-14 years) can achieve a substantial public health impact. However, HWWS interventions targeting older children have had mixed success. Recent research has attempted to quantitatively identify effective intervention techniques; however, success is likely also influenced by the wider context of implementation. We explore nongovernmental organization (NGO) practitioners' perspectives on the challenges and solutions to HWWS interventions targeting older children to enhance understanding of what is required, beyond intervention content, for them to be effective. METHODS: We conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews in April-November 2020 with 25 practitioners employed across 11 NGOs and involved in HWWS interventions targeting older children in development and humanitarian settings. We used purposive and snowball sampling to recruit participants in roles at the global, national/regional, and local levels. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed to identify challenges and solutions to HWWS interventions targeting older children. Results were organized according to program development cycle stages. RESULTS: Twelve themes relating to perceived challenges emerged: (1) lack of prioritization, (2) funding inconsistency, (3) insufficient formative research, (4) demand on resources, (5) unengaging intervention content, (6) non-enabling physical environments, (7) availability of skilled implementers, (8) reaching out-of-school children, (9) community mistrust, (10) lack of coordination, (11) lack of evaluation rigor, and (12) failure to assign older children's HWWS as a primary outcome in evaluations of hygiene interventions. Recommended solutions were at the intervention, organization, and sector levels. CONCLUSION: Intervention design and delivery are important for the success of HWWS interventions for older children, but contextual factors, such as the availability of human and material resources and the level of coordination within and beyond the NGO sector, should also be considered. NGOs need to prioritize HWWS promotion among older children and support programs accordingly.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between responses to CHoBI7 WASH IVR quiz messages and subsequent diarrhea and WASH behaviors. Fourteen CHoBI7 IVR quiz messages on handwashing with soap and treatment of stored water were sent to 517 households with 1,777 participants during the 12-month program period. IVR message responses were classified as correct answer, incorrect answer, no response (did not press 1 or 2), and failed (did not answer the phone). Diarrhea prevalence was assessed through self-reported monthly clinical surveillance visits. Handwashing with soap was assessed by a 5-hour structured observation, and stored water quality was defined by Escherichia coli concentration. Households that responded correctly to a CHoBI7 IVR quiz message had significantly lower odds of diarrhea for all age groups (adults and children) at the subsequent visit 1 month later (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.98), and significantly greater odds of handwashing with soap after stool-related events (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.12-5.49) and E. coli levels < 100 colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL (World Health Organization high-risk cutoff) in the stored household water (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.25-3.33) compared with households that did not answer CHoBI7 IVR quiz calls. Correct responses to CHoBI7 IVR quizzes were associated with decreased diarrhea prevalence and improved stored drinking water quality and handwashing with soap behaviors at the subsequent visits. These findings suggest engagement in the CHoBI7 mobile health (mHealth) program and awareness of diarrheal disease prevention can reduce diarrhea and facilitate changes in WASH behaviors.",

Although significant progress has been made, there remains a gap in care. This project studied the association of geographical distribution of the remaining need for trachoma intervention and its association with access to basic handwashing facilities at home, as an indicator of water/sanitation infrastructure. We hypothesized that poor water sanitation would correspond to areas where trachoma intervention is still required. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis using the WHO Global Health Observatory. Spatial, correlation, and simple and multivariable regression analyses were used. METHODS: Using data from the WHO Global Health Observatory, a total of 194 countries were analyzed. Two choropleth maps were created, with inset maps focused on the South Pacific region, where the top 5 countries with the greatest population proportion requiring trachoma intervention are located. RESULTS: Correlations and the simple regression model of total population with access to handwashing facilities as the only risk factor were insignificant. However, the multivariable regression models with access to handwashing facilities (total, urban, and rural) and population density as risk factors for trachoma intervention were significant. CONCLUSION: Poor water/sanitation infrastructure correlates with trachoma burden. Therefore, water/sanitation infrastructure improvement is a worthwhile target in the efforts toward trachoma elimination, but further research on the association between these important public health indicators is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Handwashing is an effective and cost-efficient health behavior for preventing infectious diseases; however, its practice is shaped by multiple contextual factors and inequalities between different social groups in Sierra Leone. To address these inequalities, participatory approaches that allow a more equitable distribution of resources and the development of locally tailored interventions are increasingly used. However, social power dynamics have not been well integrated into the concept of participation, despite their known impact. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the role of power dynamics in participatory approaches to handwashing in Sierra Leone. METHODS: From a socio-ecological perspective, this qualitative, formative interview study aimed to identify relevant actors and their power relationships before designing a participatory handwashing project in rural Sierra Leone. A field experiment with focus groups and a research diary compared the development of power dynamics in a participatory, community-driven approach with that in a nonparticipatory top-down approach. RESULTS: According to our formative study, in community-based projects, multiple groups and actors interact directly or indirectly with each other, located within a macro level (eg, political institutions), meso level (eg, community leaders and groups), and micro level (eg, families) of a socio-ecological model. Although distinct leadership structures were noticeable and affected intervention attendance and processes of change in nonparticipatory approaches, community-led activities and handwashing increased in the participatory approach, irrespective of the leadership structure. Despite their ambivalence, the strategic inclusion of different community leaders appeared essential to enhance the value of the project, mobilize creative action, and empower lower-ranking individuals to practice handwashing. A similar ambivalent role could be observed in relation to external researchers, especially if they come from a different cultural background than the research participants, for example, from a Western country in a non-Western project setting. Although external researchers can initiate a project or provide certain resources, distinct expectations regarding their roles and resources can impact participatory efforts and power relations. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the advantages of participatory approaches for health promotion. Power dynamics should be a core component of continuous reflection and analysis in participatory projects."

Digital technologies may help to promote the hand hygiene behaviour of children. However, there is a lack of digital feedback interventions focusing on the hand hygiene behaviour of preschool children in childhood education and care settings. This study protocol aims to describe a study that evaluates the effectiveness of a gamified live feedback intervention and explores underlying behavioural theories in achieving better hand hygiene behaviour of preschool children in early childhood education and care settings. This study will be a four-arm cluster randomized controlled trial with three phases and a twelve-month follow-up by country stratification. The sample size is 106 children of which one cluster will have a minimum number of 40 children. During the baseline phase, all groups will have automated monitoring systems installed. In the intervention phase, the control group will have no screen activity. The intervention groups will have feedback displays during the handwashing activity. Intervention A will receive instructions, and intervention B and C groups will receive instructions and a reward. In the post-intervention phase, all the groups will have no screen activity except intervention C which will receive instructions from the screen but no reward. The outcome measures will be hand hygiene behaviour, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, intervention, and post-intervention phases and a 12-month follow-up. The data will be analysed with quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings of the planned study will provide whether this gamified live feedback intervention can be recommended to be used in educational settings to improve the hand hygiene behaviour of preschool children to promote health.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Handwashing with soap is critical for the prevention of diarrhoeal diseases and outbreak related diseases, including interrupting the transmission of COVID-19. People living in large displacement settings are particularly vulnerable to such outbreaks, however, practicing handwashing is typically challenging in these contexts. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative assessment of the implementation of a combined intervention to facilitate handwashing behaviour in displacement camps and in surrounding communities in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention comprised a 'hardware' infrastructural component (provision of the Oxfam Handwashing Station) and a 'software' hygiene promotion package (Mum's Magic Hands). We used programmatic logbooks, interviews with implementation staff and focus group discussions with crisis-affected populations to assess the use, feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. RESULTS: Both components of the intervention were viewed as novel and appealing by implementing staff and crisis-affected populations across the study sites. The acceptability of the handwashing station could be improved by redesigning the tap and legs, exploring local supply chain options, and by providing a greater number of facilities. The implementation of the hygiene promotion package varied substantially by country making it challenging to evaluate and compare. A greater focus on community engagement could address misconceptions, barriers related to the intuitiveness of the handwashing station design, and willingness to participate in the hygiene promotion component. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a 'hardware' and 'software' intervention in these settings appeared to facilitate both access and use of handwashing facilities. The acceptability of the combined intervention was partially because a great deal of effort had been put into their design. However, even when delivering well-designed interventions, there are many contextual aspects that need to be considered, as well as unintended consequences which can affect the acceptability of an intervention."

Design-Expert software was employed to optimize media particle size, filter depth, and flowrate. Linear and quadratic models were found to best fit the responses of turbidity and suspended solids removal, respectively. Particle size and flow rate were the only parameters with significant effects on removal of turbidity and suspended solids. Optimal conditions were found to be media particle size 0.6 mm, filter depth 12 cm, and flow rate 0.3 Lmin-1, corresponding to removal efficiencies of 62 and 67% for turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS), respectively, as predicted by the model. Validation of model at optimal conditions resulted in turbidity and TSS removal of 55 and 53%, respectively. Additionally, removal efficiencies of the roughing filter towards apparent colour, true colour, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from handwashing wastewater were 56, 20, 32, and 5%, respectively. Overall, although turbidity of filtered water was >50 NTU, the reduction achieved by roughing filtration is a significant step in enhancing the performance of water treatment processes downstream, including filtration and adsorption by slow sand filters and activated carbon, respectively.",

DESIGN: A 2-group (control and experimental) pretest with 2 post-tests design was used. The control group received training without the video and the experimental group received the food safety training with a realistic-event video. Measurements used to address the purpose and objectives of this study included questionnaires and direct observations. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: The sample consisted of 443 school nutrition employees responsible for food preparation and service affiliated with 21 school districts in 18 states. Approximately half of the sample attended the original unmodified training and the other half attended the modified training. Data were collected in the United States during 2017. A total of 338 employees participated in the observations and 443 participants completed the questionnaires during the 3 phases; 935 questionnaires were used for the analysis. INTERVENTION: The intervention involved a food safety training program embedded with a realistic-event video related to handwashing. The video used previous research to target antecedents to handwashing behavior among participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Actual behavior was observed across 3 phases-pretraining, post training, and final-for both the control and experimental groups. In addition, indirect and direct measures of behavioral intentions for handwashing were measured. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: For the observation data, a 2-way, fixed-effects, mixed-model procedure was used to analyze the data. Simple and multiple linear regression and contingency table analyses looking for differences among phases and treatments were used for questionnaire data analysis. RESULTS: Most practices were reported as in compliance (51.3% to 80.6%) for both the control and experimental groups during all phases. The experimental group had a higher behavioral intention of properly washing their hands than participants in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that handwashing practices were in compliance most of the time for both the control and experimental groups during all 3 observation periods. Differences among the data collection periods on the theory of planned behavior constructs indicated no statistical effect of the treatment (exposure to the video) between the control and intervention groups.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impacts of multicomponent school water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) interventions on children's health are unclear. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effects of a school WaSH intervention on children's malnutrition, dehydration, health literacy (HL), and handwashing (HW) in Metro Manila, Philippines. METHODS: The trial lasted from June 2017 to March 2018 and included children, in grades 5, 6, 7, and 10, from 15 schools. At baseline 756 children were enrolled. Seventy-eight children in two clusters were purposively assigned to the control group (CG); 13 clusters were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: low-intensity health education (LIHE; two schools, n = 116 children), medium-intensity health education (MIHE; seven schools, n = 356 children), and high-intensity health education (HIHE; four schools, n = 206 children). The intervention consisted of health education (HE), WaSH policy workshops, provision of hygiene supplies, and WaSH facilities repairs. Outcomes were: height-for-age and body mass index-for-age Z scores (HAZ, BAZ); stunting, undernutrition, overnutrition, dehydration prevalence; HL and HW scores. We used anthropometry to measure children's physical growth, urine test strips to measure dehydration, questionnaires to measure HL, and observation to measure HW practice. The same measurements were used during baseline and endline. We used multilevel mixed-effects logistic and linear regression models to assess intervention effects. RESULTS: None of the interventions reduced undernutrition prevalence or improved HAZ, BAZ, or overall HL scores. Low-intensity HE reduced stunting (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.95; 95% CI 0.93 to 0.96), while low- (aOR 0.57; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96) and high-intensity HE (aOR 0.63; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93) reduced overnutrition. Medium- (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0.02; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04) and high-intensity HE (aIRR 0.01; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16) reduced severe dehydration. Medium- (aOR 3.18; 95% CI 1.34 to 7.55) and high-intensity HE (aOR 3.89; 95% CI 3.74 to 4.05) increased observed HW after using the toilet/urinal. CONCLUSION: Increasing the intensity of HE reduced prevalence of stunting, overnutrition, and severe dehydration and increased prevalence of observed HW. Data may be relevant for school WaSH interventions in the Global South. Interventions may have been more effective if adherence was higher, exposure to interventions longer, parents/caregivers were more involved, or household WaSH was addressed.

This study was aimed at investigating elementary schoolchildren's handwashing practice at two critical moments, namely, before eating and after using the toilet and its associated factors. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at ten public secondary schools in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, between February and March 2019. Data were collected from all fifth-grade children's parents at the selected schools by using a self-reported questionnaire. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted using STATA/MP version 13.0. RESULTS: A total of 1507 parents/guardians of 5th-grade school children participated. Reported schoolchildren's handwashing practice for both critical moments was 50.1%. It was significantly associated with female gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.56 (95%CI = 0.45, 0.70)), number of siblings (AOR = 0.72 (95%CI = 0.61, 0.80)), and availability of handwashing amenity at school (AOR = 1.1595%CI = 0.86, 1.42)). Only 34% of children wash their hands with soap at school, and the most common reasons for skipping handwashing were an absence of soap (23.9%), lack of sink (14.5%), and the use of hand sanitizer (19.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The school children's handwashing practice at two critical moments is considerably low. The main disabling factors of regular handwashing at school included insufficient handwashing facility and soap. Therefore, promoting HW facilities and innovative and participatory education for elementary schoolchildren should be prioritized.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Estimates of the effectiveness of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions that provide high levels of service on childhood diarrhoea are scarce. We aimed to provide up-to-date estimates on the burden of disease attributable to WASH and on the effects of different types of WASH interventions on childhood diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated previous reviews following their search strategy by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and BIOSIS Citation Index for studies of basic WASH interventions and of WASH interventions providing a high level of service, published between Jan 1, 2016, and May 25, 2021. We included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials conducted at household or community level that matched exposure categories of the so-called service ladder approach of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for WASH. Two reviewers independently extracted study-level data and assessed risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and certainty of evidence using a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We analysed extracted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs using random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42016043164. FINDINGS: 19 837 records were identified from the search, of which 124 studies were included, providing 83 water (62 616 children), 20 sanitation (40 799 children), and 41 hygiene (98 416 children) comparisons. Compared with untreated water from an unimproved source, risk of diarrhoea was reduced by up to 50% with water treated at point of use (POU): filtration (n=23 studies; RR 0·50 [95% CI 0·41-0·60]), solar treatment (n=13; 0·63 [0·50-0·80]), and chlorination (n=25; 0·66 [0·56-0·77]). Compared with an unimproved source, provision of an improved drinking water supply on premises with higher water quality reduced diarrhoea risk by 52% (n=2; 0·48 [0·26-0·87]). Overall, sanitation interventions reduced diarrhoea risk by 24% (0·76 [0·61-0·94]). Compared with unimproved sanitation, providing sewer connection reduced diarrhoea risk by 47% (n=5; 0·53 [0·30-0·93]). Promotion of handwashing with soap reduced diarrhoea risk by 30% (0·70 [0·64-0·76]). INTERPRETATION: WASH interventions reduced risk of diarrhoea in children in LMICs. Interventions supplying either water filtered at POU, higher water quality from an improved source on premises, or basic sanitation services with sewer connection were associated with increased reductions. Our results support higher service levels called for under SDG 6. Notably, no studies evaluated interventions that delivered access to safely managed WASH services, the level of service to which universal coverage by 2030 is committed under the SDG.

BACKGROUND: Despite the well-documented benefits of handwashing (HW), low compliance is common among adolescents. HW space in schools has always been treated as attached spaces of little matter, which is unfavorable to public health. According to environment behavior perspective, personal motivation of HWC may be motivated by active environment. METHOD: A school-based investigation and a 30-week environmental behavior experiment were conducted when students returned to school after the COVID-19 pandemic closure in 2020 in China to evaluate the effects of active environment interventions selected by previous survey on promoting adolescents' HW rate. Digital infrared counters were used to unobtrusively document their behavior. RESULTS: Results in summer revealed a positive effect on all intervention groups. The effects of combined interventions were higher than the effect of any single intervention. However, HW rates of all groups declined sharply in the coldest month and the between-group differences decreased. Significant correlations were found between HW rates and satisfaction with the intervention schemes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that architectural environmental intervention may potentially be a positive, friendly, and one-time investment mean to expand the HWC intervention scope from passive policies to positive experience, and HW space design for adolescents should be treated as a public health strategy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: School-based de-worming is advocated as a strategy for reducing the burden of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections among children. However, re-infection tends to occur rapidly, suggesting that comprehensive water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) improvements may be needed to prevent this. We qualitatively assessed the influence of parental engagement activities on parents' motivation to improve WASH infrastructure and hygiene practices at home in the context of a school-based de-worming programme. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study nested within the Mikono Safi trial, designed to assess the effect of a WASH intervention on STH infection prevalence in children. Meetings were organized for parents/guardians at schools where they were given information about STH infection, the role of WASH in STH infection prevention, and actionable steps they could take at home. During the meetings, parents/guardians received information about their own child's STH infection status. Twenty purposively selected households were visited and interviewed 3 times over a period of about 8-months. We employed thematic analysis; findings are reported following the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) framework. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The engagement strategy improved parents'/guardians' knowledge and skills about handwashing with soap and its benefits. Parents/guardians reported that the sessions had motivated them to improve WASH infrastructure at home. Of 20 households included in this study, 17 renovated or built new latrines and 18 installed handwashing facilities. However, only 8 households established and maintained handwashing stations with both soap and water at 8 months. CONCLUSIONS: The engagement of parents/guardians in a school-based WASH education intervention as part of the Mikono Safi trial resulted in increased knowledge and motivation about handwashing and sanitation. This led to improvements in sanitation facilities and handwashing opportunities at home. However, long-term success in provision of water and soap was limited, indicating that sustained engagement may be required to encourage households to ensure these materials are consistently available at home.",

METHODS: Randomized controlled experimental study with the formation of intervention and control groups. DESIGN: The study (triple-blind) was conducted between August 11 and November 17, 2020, in the cardiology clinic of a tertiary hospital in western Turkey. The pre-study sample size was calculated as a minimum 45 at 80% strength, 0.05 significance level, and 0.60 influence quantity for each group. 112 volunteers meeting the criteria were included in the study. The study was completed with a total of 105 individuals in the intervention group (n=50) and control group (n=53). The post-study strength was (1- β) =1. This study was performed in five stages: (1) collection of data, (2) randomization, (3) providing training, (4) contacting the intervention and control groups for follow-up a month later, and (5) collection of the follow-up data. FINDINGS: The training provided to cardiac patients increased the correct handwashing technique (U=36.00; p<0.001) and the correct mask-wearing technique (U=99.00; p<0.001) and decreased COVID-19 fear (U=883.5; p<0.001) and anxiety (U=751.0; p<0.001) (p <.05). CONCLUSION: It can be considered that the training provided to the cardiac patients in preventing COVID-19 may also be suitable for other risk groups.

DESIGN: A cluster randomised controlled trial was employed with two arms: handwashing with water and wood ash versus handwashing with water alone. SETTING: Rural households of East Dembiya District, Central Gondar Zone, Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: 440 mothers and caregivers of children younger than 5 years assigned (1:1, 220 in each group) in clusters, with buffer zones between each cluster. INTERVENTION: Health education on effective handwashing was given to the intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group used wood ash of the same quantity (ie, one closed palm). OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was microbial contamination of the hands, measured by means of Escherichia coli counts before and after handwashing. RESULTS: At baseline, 75.9% and 67.7% of the participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively, had dirt on their fingernails, and the hands of all participants in both groups were contaminated with E. coli. The mean E. coli counts recovered at baseline were 3.07 log10 colony forming unit (CFU)/swab in the intervention group and 3.03 log10 CFU/swab in the control group, while at endline it was 1.4 log10 CFU/swab in the intervention group and 3.02 log10 CFU/swab in the control group. The mean E.coli counts was reduced by 1.65 log10 due to the intervention (difference-in-differences: β= -1.65, 95% CI= -1.84 to -1.46). CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of the swab samples tested positive for E. coli after handwashing with water and wood ash, which indicates wood ash is not very effective in terms of completely removing micro-organisms on the hands. However, wood ash was significantly better than water alone in reducing the concentration of faecal coliform organisms on the hands. Local health authorities should primarily promote handwashing with soap. However, in the absence of soap, use of wood ash over water alone might be appropriate.

Methods: A two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was used. Mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was also used to identify determinants of handwashing practice with essential agents. Results: In Ethiopia, household handwashing practices with essential agents had spatial variation (Moran's Index 0.62, p < 0.001). The Amhara and Somali regions were identified as significant hotspots with low handwashing practice using essential agents. Conclusion: In Ethiopia, handwashing practice with essential agents showed spatial variation across the country with a very low rate. Areas with low handwashing practice with essential agents need high priority in the allocation of resources to ensure communities' access to fixed and portable handwashing facilities, soap, and reliable water supplies. Households with low access to improved sanitation facilities, low wealth status, and low educational status should be targeted for the intervention.",

The study aimed to measure the effectiveness of handwashing at Dilla University referral hospital. METHOD: This study consisted of 2 parts; the survey work and laboratory analysis. A total of 63 participants were selected to take surveys using an interviewer-administered questionnaire to collect the data regarding the socio-demographic and hand hygiene-related practices. A laboratory tests (swab test) was used to assess handwashing effectiveness from 63 participants by taking 126 swab test (63 before and after hand washing sessions). A swab test was collected from the palms of each participant before and after hand washing using a sterile technique. The cultures were then incubated aerobically overnight at 37°C, and examined for microbial growth. The bacterial load was reported as the number of colony-forming units (CFU). RESULT: The proportion of effective hand washing in Dilla University Referral Hospital was 82.5%. The mean colony-forming unit before and after handwashing were 55 and 2 CFU/ml, respectively with an average reduction of 94.6% in terms of CFU/ml. The mean amount of water used for effective handwashing was 336.03 (±219.46) ml. There was a significant mean difference in the amount of water used and duration of hand rubbing between effective and non-effective handwashing among the participants (P < 0.01). The bacterial load before and after handwashing indicated that there was a significant (53.3 mean CFU) reduction in bacterial load after handwashing practice which indicated that the handwashing intervention in the Referral hospital was effective (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The proportion of effective Hand washing in Dilla University referral Hospital was 82.5% with a 94.6% reduction in terms of (CFU/ml). The amount of water use and the duration of hand rubbing showed a significant difference in the reduction of the microbial load."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Handwashing with soap has the potential to curb cholera transmission. This research explores how populations experienced and responded to the 2017 cholera outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how this affected their handwashing behaviour. METHODS: Cholera cases were identified through local cholera treatment centre records. Comparison individuals were recruited from the same neighbourhoods by identifying households with no recent confirmed or suspected cholera cases. Multiple qualitative methods were employed to understand hand hygiene practices and their determinants, including unstructured observations, interviews and focus group discussions. The data collection tools and analysis were informed by the Behaviour Centred Design Framework. Comparisons were made between the experiences and practices of people from case households and participants from comparison households. RESULTS: Cholera was well understood by the population and viewed as a persistent and common health challenge. Handwashing with soap was generally observed to be rare during the outbreak despite self-reported increases in behaviour. Across case and comparison groups, individuals were unable to prioritise handwashing due to competing food-scarcity and livelihood challenges and there was little in the physical or social environments to cue handwashing or make it a convenient, rewarding or desirable to practice. The ability of people from case households to practice handwashing was further constrained by their exposure to cholera which in addition to illness, caused profound non-health impacts to household income, productivity, social status, and their sense of control. CONCLUSIONS: Even though cholera outbreaks can cause disruptions to many determinants of behaviour, these shifts do not automatically facilitate an increase in preventative behaviours like handwashing with soap. Hygiene programmes targeting outbreaks within complex crises could be strengthened by acknowledging the emic experiences of the disease and adopting sustainable solutions which build upon local disease coping mechanisms.",

However, the effect sizes of multiple interventions and participants combined adherence to the interventions are understudied. This study aimed at comparing combined intervention of water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) with each individual intervention in reducing diarrhea among under-five children in rural Dire Dawa. METHODS: a cluster randomized controlled factorial trial was conducted between October 2018 and January 2019. Householders in the first, second and third arms received waterguard, soap and both, respectively. However, householders in the control arm were followed with their customary practices. Generalized estimation equations (GEE) with log link Poisson distribution was used to compute adjusted incidence rate ratio and the corresponding 95% CIs. RESULTS: overall, 36% (aIRR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57 - 0.73), 41% (aIRR = 0.588, 95% CI: 0.53 - 0.65), and 41% (aIRR = 0.585, 95% CI: 0.53 - 0.65) reduction in incidence of diarrhea was observed in the water treatment, handwashing and combined arms, respectively. This study showed no additional benefit of combining the two interventions than the individual intervention. CONCLUSION: we recommend implementing either household water disinfection using sodium hypochlorite or household handwashing with hand hygiene promotion independently at large scale to vulnerable population to reduce diarrheal morbidity.",

The Seeds of Prosperity (SOP) program was implemented in Tamil Nadu and Assam, India, for tea supply chain workers (estate workers, small holder farmers, and farm workers). The aim was to enhance demand for diverse and nutritious foods and improve practices related to handwashing. The program used a behavior change communication approach wherein participants received weekly 1-hour group sessions with messaging on dietary diversity for 5 weeks and handwashing for 4 weeks. An impact evaluation was conducted to estimate changes in reported dietary and hygiene knowledge and behaviors among women. The study used a longitudinal quasi-experimental design in a subsample of program participants at baseline and post-intervention among both intervention and comparison. There was a small but significant increase in mean dietary diversity (DD) for all 4 worker groups (ranging from DD score changes of 0.3 to 0.7; P < .05) and in the proportion of women meeting the minimum dietary diversity in 2 of the 4 groups. Similarly, a significant increase in the mean number of handwashing moments was observed in 2 of the worker groups. An increase in home garden use was observed in 1 of the 4 worker groups. While the SOP program resulted in improvements in dietary diversity, most tea farming women still do not achieve minimum dietary diversity. Nutritious food access may be an important constraint to further improvement.",

Effective hand hygiene involves both a washer's technique and the duration of their wash. METHODS: The purpose of this longitudinal study was 2-fold: to improve the ability of hand-washers to meet the recommended handwashing duration of ≥20 seconds and to assess the effect of washer fatigue with the intervention. An innovative system of smart connected soap and towel dispensers synchronized to engaging video content was implemented to meet this objective. RESULTS: The intervention increased mean handwashing duration by 7.5 seconds (95% CI: 6.6, 8.4) and improved handwashing duration ≥20 seconds by 39.3% (P < .001). Using a similar cohort of hand-washers over 26 months, the video content had peak effect in month 1, and declined to a new steady state at month 11. DISCUSSION: Handwashing for the recommended time can be difficult to achieve. Most hand hygiene studies examine the rate of completion without measuring duration. CONCLUSIONS: Video engagement can improve and sustain handwashing duration. To mitigate creative and messaging fatigue, video content refresh for this intervention should be considered at 3 months for optimal effect or at 11 months prior to full decline to new steady state.",

A prospective observational study was conducted over a 3-week period prior to the intervention, followed by a 4-week period post intervention. HH performance was monitored by a research assistant whose office location enabled direct and video-assisted observation of the ICU entrance. A total of 609 entries to the ICU was recorded. Overall HH performance was 46.9% (92/196) before and 98.5% (406/413) after the intervention.

Effective handwashing at critical time-points may mitigate these diseases. However, there is a lack of published data investigating this association in school-aged children in India. This study is part of a larger prospective handwashing intervention study in a low-income community in New Delhi, India examining the associations between handwashing behavior and diarrhea and RI in schoolchildren. This current study reports the findings of the baseline survey administered to 272 mother-child dyads. Children aged 8-12 years, and their mothers, were recruited from six schools. A baseline questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data, handwash behavior, and mother-reported recent diarrhea and RI incidence among the children. Handwashing before and after preparing food, after defecation, and after cleaning dishes significantly reduced the odds of diarrhea by over 70%, and of RI by over 56%. Using a clean cloth after handwashing lowered odds of diarrhea and RI by 72% and 63% respectively. Around 60% of the participants believed that handwashing could prevent diarrhea and RI in their children. There was a low prevalence of handwashing at critical time-points and a poor perception regarding handwashing benefits. To improve handwashing behavior, hygiene promotion programs need to understand what motivates and hinders handwashing in vulnerable populations.",

We piloted a low-cost handwashing intervention among elementary schoolchildren in Bangladesh. We trained teachers to lead behavior change communication sessions using flipcharts to encourage students' handwashing before eating, after defecating, and after cleaning school toilets; provided handwashing stations (reservoirs with taps and stool + basin + soapy water solution [mix of 30 gm detergent with 1.5 L water] + pump top bottle with steel holder); and formed hygiene committees for maintenance and covering the recurrent cost of detergent. We evaluated intervention acceptability, feasibility, and potential for sustainability at 1 and 14 months after the intervention. At baseline, of 300 before eating events, no one washed hands with soap, and 99.7% (299) did not wash hands at all as soap was unavailable. Out of 269 after toileting events, 0.7% (2) washed hands with soap, and 88% (237) did not wash hands. After 4 weeks of the intervention, 45% (87/195 before eating events), 83% (155/186 after toileting events), and 100% (15/15 after cleaning toilet events) washed both hands with soapy water as children found it accessible, low cost, and child friendly. After 14 months, 9.4% (55/586 before eating events) and 37% (172/465 after toileting events) washed both hands with soapy water for health benefits. The intervention was acceptable and feasible; it overcame limited access to soap and water and was affordable as schools covered the recurrent costs of detergent. Further research should explore long-term habit adoption and impact on health and attendance.",

We aimed to evaluate the effect of three handwashing interventions on handwashing with soap (HWWS) after toilet use. METHODS: In this cluster randomised trial in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, we randomly assigned communal housing compounds (1:1:1) to receive one of three interventions: a theory of normative social behaviour (TNSB) intervention, including provision of handwashing stations; handwashing stations only; and no intervention. The TNSB intervention was designed to shift the outcome expectation associated with HWWS from health to riddance of faeces-related disgust, and to increase the perceived descriptive norm and perceived handwashing publicness. Participants and fieldworkers were masked to the study objectives. The primary outcome was HWWS after toilet use, assessed at 1 month and 5 months follow-ups. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR201501000892239. FINDINGS: Between April 10 and May 22, 2014, we identified 92 eligible compounds, of which 75 compounds were included. Follow-up data on HWWS were available for 23 compounds for the TNSB group, 25 compounds for the handwashing station-only group, and 25 compounds for the control group. The study ended in April, 2017. Compared with a frequency of 5% (29 of 604 occasions) in the control group, HWWS after toilet use increased to 9% (49 of 557 occasions; adjusted risk ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·16-3·08) in the handwashing station-only group, and 24% (143 of 588 occasions; 4·82, 3·06-7·59) in the TNSB group, at the 1-month follow-up. The intervention effect was only sustained in the TNSB group (98 [22%] of 450 compounds; 2·68, 1·65-4·34). INTERPRETATION: A social norm-based handwashing intervention combined with disgust-inducing messages, with provision of handwashing stations, was effective at increasing HWWS after toilet use. The provision of handwashing stations alone had little effect. Future studies should investigate whether the same approach, when delivered via mass media, can have a similar effect to the face-to-face delivery used in this study. FUNDING: None.",

      "abstract": "Handwashing is key to preventing the transmission of various infectious diseases of which school-aged children are particularly susceptible. Traditional, information-messaging campaigns may increase handwashing awareness but have had limited success in promoting behavior change. Behavioral economics \"nudges,\" which explicitly target the knowledge-behavior gap, is a promising alternative. We evaluate the impact of school-based nudges in the first fully powered cluster randomized controlled trial in the Philippines. Out of our sample of 132 eligible schools, we randomly assigned half to receive nudges, including contextual cues (painted footpath from toilet to handwashing station) and visible reminders (posters and eye sticker), and half to the control group. Four months after implementation, we measured handwashing with soap (HWWS) after toilet use among grades 1-6 students using direct observation and compared this outcome between treatment and control schools. We also assessed whether nudges increased soap availability. The intervention increased HWWS rates by 17.3% points (pp), [95% CI: 4.2, 30.4] in treatment schools from the control group mean of 11.7%. The effect size was comparable across gender and age groups. Access to functioning handwashing facilities with soap increased by 36% (+20.2 pp, 95% CI: 10.9, 29.4). Mediation analysis suggests the program simultaneously nudged students to wash hands with soap in classrooms that already had soap, and nudged teachers to provide soap where it was not already available. These findings demonstrate that behavioral nudges costing less than $70 per school can lead to significant increases in HWWS among students 4 months post-intervention.",

Despite its immense health benefits, the lowest prevalence of handwashing is found in low-income countries. Here, its practice is not only determined by individual behavior, but also heavily shaped by deprivations in the social and structural ecology. Moreover, handwashing barriers are not equally experienced as overlapping social identities (e.g., age and gender) intersect and create inequities between members of different social groups. To embrace the complexities of handwashing beyond individual-level behavior and singular social identities, a combined socioecological and intersectional perspective is employed. This multi-level approach with regards to intersecting privileges and disadvantages serves as a basis to promote this highly important health behavior. METHODS: This study used a qualitative, theory-based approach and combined data from two samples: experts in health promotion (n = 22) and local citizens stratified by gender and rural/urban location (n = 56). Data was collected in face-to-face interviews in Sierra Leone between November 2018 and January 2019 and analyzed using thematic analysis and typology of the qualitative data. RESULTS: The conceptualization of multi-level determinants of handwashing within a socioecological model showed the high relevance of inhibiting social and structural factors for handwashing practice. By establishing seven distinguishing social identity dimensions, data demonstrates that individuals within the same social setting yet with distinct social identities experience strikingly differing degrees of power and privileges to enact handwashing. While a local leader is influential and may also change structural-level determinants, a young, rural wife experiences multiple social and structural constraints to perform handwashing with soap, even if she has high handwashing intentions. CONCLUSION: This study provides a holistic analytical framework for the identification of determinants on multiple levels and accumulating intersections of socially produced inequalities for handwashing and is applicable to other health topics. As the exploration of handwashing was approached from a solution-focused instead of a problem-focused perspective, the analysis can guide multi-level intervention approaches (e.g., using low-cost, participatory activities at the community level to make use of the available social capital).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Washing hands helps prevent transmission of seasonal and pandemic respiratory viruses. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) during the swine flu outbreak, participants with access to a fully automated, digital intervention promoting handwashing reported washing their hands more often and experienced fewer respiratory tract infections than those without access to the intervention. Based on these findings, the intervention was adapted, renamed as \"Germ Defence,\" and a study was designed to assess the preliminary dissemination of the intervention to the general public to help prevent the spread of seasonal colds and flu. OBJECTIVE: This study compares the process evaluations of the RCT and Germ Defence dissemination to examine (1) how web-based research enrollment procedures affected those who used the intervention, (2) intervention usage in the 2 contexts, and (3) whether increased intentions to wash hands are replicated once disseminated. METHODS: The RCT ran between 2010 and 2012 recruiting participants offline from general practices, with restricted access to the intervention (N=9155). Germ Defence was disseminated as an open access website for use by the general public from 2016 to 2019 (N=624). The process evaluation plan was developed using Medical Research Council guidance and the framework for Analyzing and Measuring Usage and Engagement Data. Both interventions contained a goal-setting section where users self-reported current and intended handwashing behavior across 7 situations. RESULTS: During web-based enrolment, 54.3% (17,511/32,250) of the RCT participants dropped out of the study compared to 36.5% (358/982) of Germ Defence users. Having reached the start of the intervention, 93.8% (8586/9155) of RCT users completed the core section, whereas 65.1% (406/624) of Germ Defence users reached the same point. Users across both studies selected to increase their handwashing in 5 out of 7 situations, including before eating snacks (RCT mean difference 1.040, 95% CI 1.016-1.063; Germ Defence mean difference 0.949, 95% CI 0.766-1.132) and after blowing their nose, sneezing, or coughing (RCT mean difference 0.995, 95% CI 0.972-1.019; Germ Defence mean difference 0.842, 95% CI 0.675-1.008). CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the preliminary dissemination of Germ Defence to the RCT, we were able to examine the potential effects of the research procedures on uptake and attrition such as the sizeable dropout during the RCT enrolment procedure that may have led to a more motivated sample. The Germ Defence study highlighted the points of attrition within the intervention. Despite sample bias in the trial context, the intervention replicated increases in intentions to handwash when used \"in the wild.\" This preliminary dissemination study informed the adaptation of the intervention for the COVID-19 health emergency, and it has now been disseminated globally.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hands play a part in the transmission of infections. Handwashing with soap sufficiently reduces the level of hand contamination and the spread of infections. As soap is not usually available due to cost, ash is often used as a zero-cost alternative to soap in the rural settings of developing countries. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of ash to reduce microbial contamination of hands. This study is, therefore, designed to assess the effect of ash on microbial contamination of hands in the rural settings of northwest Ethiopia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm clustered-randomised controlled trial will be employed. A total of 11 clusters per arm will be selected using simple random sampling technique. A total of 220 mothers or caregivers of under-5 children will be included in each arm. After providing health education on effective handwashing process, we will ask study subjects to do the usual activities. We will then take swab samples from the dominant hand before washing. After swabbing, participants will be asked to wash their hands with water only and with ash by following effective handwashing procedures. We will again take swab samples from the dominant hand after washing and drying. Finally, we will compare each intervention arm against the control. A generalised estimating equation (GEE) with robust SE estimation will be used to account the cluster nature of data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Results will be published in peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences.

      "abstract": "Safe and accessible water services for hand hygiene are critical to human health and well-being. However, access to handwashing facilities is limited in cities in the Global South, where rapid urbanisation, service backlogs, lack of infrastructure and capacity, and water scarcity impact on the ability of local governments to provide them. Community participation and the co-production of knowledge in the development of innovative technologies, which are aligned with Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) principles, can lead to more sustainable and socially-acceptable hand hygiene systems. This paper presents the outcomes of the testing of the Autarky handwashing station, a technology that provides onsite treatment and recycling of handwashing water, in an informal settlement in Durban, South Africa. The transdisciplinary research approach adopted enabled the participation of multiple stakeholders with different knowledge systems in the framing, testing and evaluation of the system. The process of co-producing knowledge, as well as the outcomes of the testing, namely high levels of functionality and social acceptability of the technology, supported the WASH principles. The evaluation revealed that the Autarky handwashing station is a niche intervention that improved access to safe and appealing handwashing facilities in an informal settlement. Its novel design, socially desirable features, reliability and ability to save water increased its acceptance in the community. The testing of the system in a real-world context revealed the value of including communities in knowledge production processes for technology innovation. Further work is required to ensure that real-time monitoring of system function is feasible before such systems can be implemented at larger scale.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: To identify the extent of the provision of handwashing amenities in public toilets at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also to make comparisons with a related pre-pandemic survey. METHODS: We collected data from 400 toilet facilities that were open to the public: all those in three contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around other parts of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a 2012/2013 survey. RESULTS: Of the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for handwashing and 14.8% had no soap. There was COVID-19-related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of the COVID-19 QR code used for contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic handwashing signage in 1.8%. The handwashing water had 'no-touch' activation at 28.0% of toilets, and 18.5% of toilets had no-touch bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets had damage that would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats). This new survey found significantly increased provision of soap (risk ratio = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.25 to 1.72), but no increased provision of water, at the 128 sites that had also been examined in the previous survey. CONCLUSIONS: Although handwashing is probably a much less critical COVID-19 control intervention than reducing aerosol transmission, it should still be strongly supported. Yet this survey found multiple deficiencies with handwashing amenities at public toilets and only modest improvements since a previous survey.",

      "abstract": "Household members of diarrhea patients are at higher risk of developing diarrheal diseases (>100 times for cholera) than the general population during the 7 days after the diarrhea patient is admitted at a health facility. There is growing evidence demonstrating that theory-driven water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions are likely to yield greater behavior change than those based on health education alone. The Cholera Hospital-Based Intervention for 7-Days (CHoBI7) mobile health (mHealth) program is a theory-driven WASH intervention initially delivered to a diarrhea patient by a health promoter during a health facility visit and reinforced through weekly voice and text messages. In the recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CHoBI7-mHealth program in Bangladesh, this intervention significantly reduced diarrheal disease and stunting, and increased handwashing with soap and stored drinking water quality over the 12-month program period. The aim of this study was to assess the underlying mechanism of change of this intervention. Handwashing with soap was measured by 5-hour structured observation. Stored drinking water quality was assessed by the presence of Escherichia coli during unannounced spot checks. Psychosocial factors were measured among 1,468 participants in the CHoBI7-mHealth RCT. Perceived susceptibility, response efficacy, self-efficacy, dirt reactivity, and diarrhea knowledge were mediators of the CHoBI7-mHealth program's effect on stored drinking water quality at the 1-week follow-up. Self-efficacy, response efficacy, and diarrhea knowledge were mediators of the intervention's effect on handwashing with soap habit maintenance and stored drinking water quality at the 12-month follow-up. This study demonstrates how theory-driven approaches for intervention design can facilitate WASH behavior change.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internally displaced persons fleeing their homes due to conflict and drought are particularly at risk of morbidity and mortality from diarrhoeal diseases. Regular handwashing with soap (HWWS) could substantially reduce the risk of these infections, but the behaviour is challenging to practice while living in resource-poor, informal settlements. To mitigate these challenges, humanitarian aid organisations distribute hygiene kits, including soap and handwashing infrastructure. Our study aimed to assess the effect of modified hygiene kits on handwashing behaviours among internally displaced persons in Moyale, Ethiopia. METHODS: The pilot study evaluated three interventions: providing liquid soap; scented soap bar; and the inclusion of a mirror in addition to the standard hygiene kit. The hygiene kits were distributed to four study arms. Three of the arms received one of the interventions in addition to the standard hygiene kit. Three to six weeks after distribution the change in behaviour and perceptions of the interventions were assessed through structured observations, surveys and focus group discussions. RESULTS: HWWS was rare at critical times for all study arms. In the liquid soap arm, HWWS was observed for only 20% of critical times. This result was not indicated significantly different from the control arm which had a prevalence of 17% (p-value = 0.348). In the mirror and scented soap bar intervention arms, HWWS prevalence was 11 and 10%, respectively. This was indicated to be significantly different from the control arm. Participants in the focus group discussions indicated that liquid soap, scented soap bar and the mirror made handwashing more desirable. In contrast, participants did not consider the soap bar normally distributed in hygiene kits as nice to use. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of an increased prevalence of handwashing with soap following distribution of the three modified hygiene kits. However, our study indicates the value in better understanding hygiene product preferences as this may contribute to increased acceptability and use among crisis-affected populations. The challenges of doing research in a conflict-affected region had considerable implications on this study's design and implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov 6 September 2019 (reg no: NCT04078633 )."

METHODOLOGY: We explore resident's perspectives about Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) and hand washing. In baseline, participants completed socio-demographic characteristics and hand-washing habits survey. The intervention consisted of sending SMS three times a week for two months about hand hygiene and \"five moments\" for hand washing. The cultures of hands and cell phones were analyzed at baseline, 2 months and 4 months. We used chi-square and adjusted Generalized Estimating Equations. RESULTS: Five physicians were interviewed and 33 participants were included for quantitative analysis. Critical barriers that hinder hand washing were identified. The proportion of Staphylococcus aureus in hands was 54.5% at baseline and was significantly reduced at 2 months follow-up (p = 0.009), but, benefit was lost when the intervention was discontinued; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. were observed in 22.2% of hands, no changes were noted with intervention. In cell phones, there was a tendency to lower values of bacterial colonization after intervention for Staphylococcus aureus growth. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of contamination in hands and phones in medical residents were found. Serious barriers to compliance with hand washing must be overcome. It is possible that prolonged or continuous interventions could be necessary to optimize hand washing and reduce hand and cell phones contamination.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Handwashing with soap reduces diarrheal diseases burden considerably. However, the importance of handwashing in homes has received little attention in rural eastern Ethiopia. The effectiveness of handwashing may be reduced by lack of information on when and in what event hands must be washed, the frequency of handwashing, the individual who should wash his/her hands, and the procedure of handwashing. In these areas, indicators of adherence to handwashing are yet to be established. This study aimed at assessing the efficiency of handwashing on reducing diarrheal disease in children under 5 years old in rural kebeles of Dire Dawa, east Ethiopia. METHODS: Community-based cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in rural kebeles of Dire Dawa for 4 months starting from October 2018 to January 2019. Selected clusters were randomized in intervention and control arms using draw method and data collectors conducted the baseline survey. Households assigned to the intervention group were given two bars of plain soap on a bi-monthly basis together with information promoting hand hygiene. Control households were allowed to continue their habitual handwashing practices. We compared the diarrheal incidences of the intervention and non-intervention households. Generalized estimation equations using Poisson family and log choice of the link was employed to calculate adjusted incidence rate ratio with its 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: We recorded a significant lesser diarrheal incidence in the handwashing arm than in the non-intervention arm (6.9 versus 13.8 episodes per 100 person weeks of observation). In all, there was a 41% reduction in diarrheal incidence in the intervention arm in relation to the non-intervention arm. CONCLUSION: Handwashing with soap complemented with hand hygiene promotion significantly decreased diarrheal episodes in children under 5 years old in rural kebeles of Dire Dawa. We recommend the promotion and adaptation of washing hands using soap at recommended times to be an effective means of reducing childhood diarrhea morbidity in rural populations of Ethiopia towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 6.

To reduce the prevalence of these diseases, effective interventions for adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) should be implemented. This paper describes the design of a cluster-randomized controlled trial that will compare the efficacy of four school-based WaSH interventions for improving children's health literacy, handwashing, and nutrition. Interventions consisted of (1) WaSH policy reinforcement; (2) low-, medium-, or high-volume health education; (3) hygiene supplies; and (4) WaSH facilities (e.g., toilets, urinals, handwashing basins) improvements. We randomly allocated school clusters from the intervention arm to one of four groups to compare with schools from the control arm. Primary outcomes were: children's health literacy, physical growth, nutrition status, and handwashing prevalence. Secondary outcomes were: children's self-reported health status and history of extreme hunger, satisfaction with WaSH facilities, and school restrooms' WaSH adequacy. We will measure differences in pre- and post-intervention outcomes and compare these differences between control and intervention arms. This research protocol can be a blueprint for future school-based WaSH intervention studies to be conducted in LMICs.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea accounts for 1.8 million deaths in children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). One of the identified strategies to prevent diarrhoea is hand washing. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of hand-washing promotion interventions on diarrhoeal episodes in children and adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), and metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) on 8 January 2020, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Individually-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs that compared the effects of hand-washing interventions on diarrhoea episodes in children and adults with no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We stratified the analyses for child day-care centres or schools, community, and hospital-based settings. Where appropriate, we pooled incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using the generic inverse variance method and a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 RCTs: 13 trials from child day-care centres or schools in mainly high-income countries (54,471 participants), 15 community-based trials in LMICs (29,347 participants), and one hospital-based trial among people with AIDS in a high-income country (148 participants). All the trials and follow-up assessments were of short-term duration. Hand-washing promotion (education activities, sometimes with provision of soap) at child day-care facilities or schools prevent around one-third of diarrhoea episodes in high-income countries (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85; 9 trials, 4664 participants, high-certainty evidence) and may prevent a similar proportion in LMICs, but only two trials from urban Egypt and Kenya have evaluated this (IRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99; 2 trials, 45,380 participants; low-certainty evidence). Only four trials reported measures of behaviour change, and the methods of data collection were susceptible to bias. In one trial from the USA hand-washing behaviour was reported to improve; and in the trial from Kenya that provided free soap, hand washing did not increase, but soap use did (data not pooled; 3 trials, 1845 participants; low-certainty evidence). Hand-washing promotion among communities in LMICs probably prevents around one-quarter of diarrhoea episodes (IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; 9 trials, 15,950 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, six of these nine trials were from Asian settings, with only one trial from South America and two trials from sub-Saharan Africa. In seven trials, soap was provided free alongside hand-washing education, and the overall average effect size was larger than in the two trials which did not provide soap (soap provided: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.75; 7 trials, 12,646 participants; education only: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.05; 2 trials, 3304 participants). There was increased hand washing at major prompts (before eating or cooking, after visiting the toilet, or cleaning the baby's bottom) and increased compliance with hand-hygiene procedure (behavioural outcome) in the intervention groups compared with the control in community trials (data not pooled: 4 trials, 3591 participants; high-certainty evidence). Hand-washing promotion for the one trial conducted in a hospital among a high-risk population showed significant reduction in mean episodes of diarrhoea (1.68 fewer) in the intervention group (mean difference -1.68, 95% CI -1.93 to -1.43; 1 trial, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Hand-washing frequency increased to seven times a day in the intervention group versus three times a day in the control arm in this hospital trial (1 trial, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We found no trials evaluating the effects of hand-washing promotions on diarrhoea-related deaths or cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hand-washing promotion probably reduces diarrhoea episodes in both child day-care centres in high-income countries and among communities living in LMICs by about 30%. The included trials do not provide evidence about the long-term impact of the interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Supply driven programs that are not closely connected to community demand and demand-driven programs that fail to ensure supply both risk worsening inequity. Understanding patterns of uptake of behaviors among the poorest under ideal experimental conditions, such as those of an efficacy trial, can help identify strategies that could be strengthened in routine programmatic conditions for more equitable uptake. WASH Benefits Bangladesh was a randomized controlled efficacy trial that provided free-of cost WASH hardware along with behavior change promotion. The current paper aimed to determine the impact of the removal of supply and demand constraints on the uptake of handwashing and sanitation behaviors across wealth and education levels. METHODS: The current analysis selected 4 indicators from the WASH Benefits trial- presence of water and soap in household handwashing stations, observed mother's hand cleanliness, observed visible feces on latrine slab or floor and reported last child defecation in potty or toilet. A baseline assessment was conducted immediately after enrolment and endline assessment was conducted approximately 2 years later. We compared change in uptake of these indicators including wealth quintiles (Q) between intervention and control groups from baseline to endline. RESULTS: For hand cleanliness, the poorest mothers improved more [Q1 difference in difference, DID: 16% (7, 25%)] than the wealthiest mothers [Q5 DID: 7% (- 4, 17%)]. The poorest households had largest improvements for observed presence of water and soap in handwashing station [Q1 DID: 82% (75, 90%)] compared to the wealthiest households [Q5 DID: 39% (30, 50%)]. Similarly, poorer household demonstrated greater reductions in visible feces on latrine slab or floor [Q1DID, - 25% (- 35, - 15) Q2: - 34% (- 44, - 23%)] than the wealthiest household [Q5 DID: - 1% (- 11, 8%). For reported last child defecation in potty or toilet, the poorest mothers showed greater improvement [Q1-4 DID: 50-54% (44, 60%)] than the wealthier mothers [Q5 DID: 39% (31, 46%). CONCLUSION: By simultaneously addressing supply and demand-constraints among the poorest, we observed substantial overall improvements in equity. Within scaled-up programs, a separate targeted strategy that relaxes constraints for the poorest can improve the equity of a program.

      "abstract": "This study reports the impact of the HiFive program, a 6-week handwashing campaign that targets social and emotional motivators to improve student handwashing in primary schools in the Philippines. We designed a clustered randomized trial to evaluate the impact of HiFive on student handwashing behavior, motivation, and access. Of the sample of 196 primary schools located in two districts, half were randomly assigned to receive the program in the 2017-2018 school year. Survey and observation data were collected 3 months after the conclusion of the campaign. In control schools, only 2.5% of students were observed washing their hands with soap and water, our primary outcome and 14.8% were observed washing their hands with at least water. HiFive led to a 3.7 percentage point (p.p.) increase (P < 0.01) in the rate of handwashing with soap and water and a 5.6 p.p. increase (P = 0.03) in handwashing with at least water after toilet use. HiFive also led to a 10.8 p.p. (P < 0.01) increase in the number of handwashing facilities stocked with soap. The program had limited impact on the motivators targeted by the program, suggesting that the small improvements in handwashing may have been driven by increases in the availability of soap. More research is needed to understand how interventions can effectively trigger social motivators to improve handwashing behavior among schoolchildren, and whether the effectiveness of these programs can be augmented with \"nudge\"-based interventions from the behavioral sciences.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Effective handwashing can prevent the spread of germs, including Covid-19. However, young children can lack a fundamental understanding of germ transfer. A Germ's Journey educational resources were designed to support young children in learning about germs and handwashing. These resources include a book, website, song, online games and glo-gel activities that are informed by a behaviour change model. RESEARCH GAP: Prior research has not evaluated the impacts of these resources on behavioural outcomes. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Two intervention studies evaluated the impacts of these resources on both knowledge and behavioural outcomes. METHOD: In Study 1, children (n = 225) were recruited from four schools and randomly assigned by classrooms to participate in a multicomponent intervention (vs. control). In Study 2, children (n = 104) were recruited from a museum and randomly assigned to participate in a song intervention (vs. control). Trained observers recorded participants' engagement in six handwashing behaviours and their understanding of germs. These behavioural and knowledge outcomes were analysed using regression and related analyses. RESULTS: In Study 1, significant improvements were observed between baseline and follow up in the intervention group for both behavioural scores (Est = 0.48, SE = 0.14, t = 3.30, p = 0.001) and knowledge scores (Est = 2.14, SE = 0.52, z = 4.11, p < 0.001), whereas these improvements were not observed in the control group (ts < 1). In Study 2, the intervention group had significantly higher behavioural scores compared to the control group (Est. = -0.71, SE = 0.34, t = -2.07, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates that specifically designed hand hygiene educational resources can improve handwashing practice and understanding in young children, and could lead to the reduction of the transmission of disease within this group.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To explore whether a school-based water, sanitation and hygiene programme, which includes group hygiene activities, contributes to the formation of independent handwashing and toothbrushing habits among Filipino children. METHODS: In this cluster-randomised trial, twenty primary schools were randomly allocated to the intervention or control arm. Intervention schools received group handwashing facilities and implemented daily group handwashing and toothbrushing activities. A soap use to toilet event ratio was calculated to measure children's independent handwashing behaviour after toilet use, and dental plaque accumulation on Monday morning was measured as a proxy indicator for children's independent toothbrushing behaviour at home. RESULTS: Four months after implementation, handwashing and toothbrushing behaviours did not significantly differ between intervention and control schools. The mean soap use in intervention schools and control schools was 0.41 g and 0.30 g per toilet event, respectively (p = 0.637). Compared to baseline, mean plaque scores reduced by 4.2% and 3.5% in intervention and control schools, respectively (p = 0.857). CONCLUSIONS: Although health benefits have been established, school-based group handwashing and toothbrushing may not be sufficient to increase children's uptake of independent hygiene behaviours.",

      "abstract": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential public health implications, we are publishing this peer-reviewed manuscript in its accepted form. The final, copyedited version of the paper will be available at a later date. Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols, transmission by fomites remains plausible. During Halloween, a major event for children in numerous countries, SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk via candy fomites worries many parents. To address this concern, we enrolled 10 recently diagnosed asymptomatic or mildly/moderately symptomatic COVID-19 patients to handle typical Halloween candy (pieces individually wrapped) under three conditions: normal handling with unwashed hands, deliberate coughing and extensive touching, and normal handling following handwashing. We then used a factorial design to subject the candies to two post-handling treatments: no washing (untreated) and household dishwashing detergent. We measured SARS-CoV-2 load by RT-qPCR and LAMP. From the candies not washed post-handling, we detected SARS-CoV-2 on 60% of candies that were deliberately coughed on, 60% of candies normally handled with unwashed hands, but only 10% of candies handled after hand washing. We found that treating candy with dishwashing detergent reduced SARS-CoV-2 load by 62.1% in comparison to untreated candy. Taken together, these results suggest that although the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fomites is low even from known COVID-19 patients, viral RNA load can be reduced to near zero by the combination of handwashing by the infected patient and ≥1 minute detergent treatment after collection. We also found that the inexpensive and fast LAMP protocol was more than 80% concordant with RT-qPCR.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to important tradeoffs between risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mental health due to deprivation from normal activities, with these impacts being especially profound in children. Due to the ongoing pandemic, Halloween activities will be curtailed as a result of the concern that candy from strangers might act as fomites. Here we demonstrate that these risks can be mitigated by ensuring that prior to handling candy, the candy giver washes their hands, and by washing collected candy with household dishwashing detergent. Even in the most extreme case, with candy deliberately coughed on by known COVID-19 patients, viral load was reduced dramatically after washing with household detergent. We conclude that with reasonable precautions, even if followed only by either the candy giver or the candy recipient, the risk of viral transmission by this route is very low."

Handwashing interventions have proven efficacy for reducing the rate of transmission of common infectious diseases. Few studies have analyzed the delivery of health interventions for children in orphanages in sub-Saharan Africa. To address this gap, we conducted an ecological assessment and piloted a handwashing intervention in an orphanage in rural Malawi, focusing on caregiver knowledge and behaviors, child handwashing behaviors, and disease incidence. A secondary study aim was to demonstrate program feasibility for a future randomized controlled trial. Orphanage caregivers participated in a three-module educational intervention on handwashing based on WHO recommendations and workshops on how to teach the curriculum to children. Seventeen orphanage caregivers and 65 children were monitored for handwashing behavior and child disease incidence. Friedman's tests were conducted to compare changes in caregiver knowledge and behaviors. Child handwashing behaviors and surveillance of child disease incidence were measured pre- and post-intervention. There were significant increases in caregiver hand hygiene knowledge. At six months post-intervention, handwashing with soap increased significantly among caregivers (p < 0.001) and was observed in children. The incidence of acute respiratory infections decreased from 30% to 6% post-intervention, resulting in an 80% decrease. The incidence of diarrhea decreased from 9.2% to 6.2% post-intervention, resulting in a 33% decrease. A brief educational intervention may improve handwashing knowledge and behaviors and help to decrease the incidence of common infectious diseases in an orphanage in rural Malawi. In addition, the caregiver uptake of the intervention demonstrated feasibility for future studies.",

METHODS: We analyzed 1411 routine fecal samples from children 14±2 months old in the WSH (n = 369), nutrition counseling plus lipid-based nutrient supplement (n = 353), nutrition plus WSH (n = 360), and control (n = 329) arms for 34 enteropathogens using quantitative PCR. Outcomes included the number of co-occurring pathogens; cumulative quantity of four stunting-associated pathogens; and prevalence and quantity of individual pathogens. Masked analysis was by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: 326 (99.1%) control children had one or more enteropathogens detected (mean 3.8±1.8). Children receiving WSH interventions had lower prevalence and quantity of individual viruses than controls (prevalence difference for norovirus: -11% [95% confidence interval [CI], -5 to -17%]; sapovirus: -9% [95%CI, -3 to -15%]; and adenovirus 40/41: -9% [95%CI, -2 to - 15%]). There was no difference in bacteria, parasites, or cumulative quantity of stunting-associated pathogens between controls and any intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: WSH interventions were associated with fewer enteric viruses in children aged 14 months. Different strategies are needed to reduce enteric bacteria and parasites at this critical young age."

      "abstract": "COVID-19 is a disease with no proven pharmaceutical intervention and no proven vaccine. In such circumstances, prevention is all we have. The role of handwashing in the prevention of communicable diseases has been known for over a century, yet it remains severely neglected as a public health investment, to be periodically re-discovered during pandemic-scale infections. Over 26% of the global population has no access to a handwashing station in the home; for many low-income countries this proportion rises to over 50%. In other instances, the water is unaffordable or the supply has been shut off on account of unpaid bills. But when there is no water in the home or yard, or no mechanism for delivering enough water, good hand-washing is extremely difficult. Well before COVID-19, global cost-benefit analyses of water and sanitation investments, with benefits measured in time-savings as well as health, showed significant net benefits in all sub-regions of the developing world. This Viewpoint paper argues that, in the current crisis and its aftermath, it is imperative for governments and donors to prioritize and generously fund affordable, reliable, and accessible water services in underserved regions of the world. More than ever before, this is a foundational investment for health, dignity and development."

Maintaining high personal hygiene by frequent handwashing and be vigilant of clinical signs are widely recommended to reduce the disease burden. The national and international health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO, have provided guidelines for prevention and treatment suggestions. Here, in this brief article, based on available clinical information, the author discusses why handwashing could be protective of COVID-19 infections.

      "abstract": "Hand hygiene interventions are critical for reducing farmworker hand contamination and preventing the spread of produce-associated illness. Hand hygiene effectiveness may be produce-commodity specific, which could influence implementation strategies. This study's goal was to determine if produce commodity influences the ability of handwashing with soap and water or two-step alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) interventions to reduce soil and bacteria on farmworker hands. Farmworkers (n = 326) harvested produce (cantaloupe, jalapeño, and tomato) for 30 to 90 minutes before engaging in handwashing, two-step ABHS (jalapeño and cantaloupe), or no hand hygiene. Hands were rinsed to measure amounts of soil (absorbance at 600 nm) and indicator bacteria (coliforms, Enterococcus sp., generic Escherichia coli, and Bacteroidales universal [AllBac] and human-specific [BFD] 16S rRNA gene markers). Without hand hygiene, bacterial concentrations (0.88 to 5.1 log10 CFU/hand) on hands significantly differed by the produce commodity harvested. Moderate significant correlations (ρ = -0.41 to 0.56) between soil load and bacterial concentrations were observed. There were significant produce-commodity-specific differences in the ability of handwashing and two-step ABHS interventions to reduce soil (P < 0.0001), coliforms (P = 0.002), and Enterococcus sp. (P = 0.003), but not the Bacteroidales markers AllBac (P = 0.4) or BFD (P = 0.3). Contamination on hands of farmworkers who harvested cantaloupe was more difficult to remove. Overall, we found that a two-step ABHS intervention was similar to handwashing with soap and water at reducing bacteria on farmworker hands. In summary, produce commodity type should be considered when developing hand hygiene interventions on farms.IMPORTANCE This study demonstrated that the type of produce commodity handled influences the ability of handwashing with soap and water or a two-step alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) intervention to reduce soil and bacterial hand contamination. Handwashing with soap and water, as recommended by the FDA's Produce Safety Rule, when tested in three agricultural environments, does not always reduce bacterial loads. Consistent with past results, we found that the two-step ABHS method performed similarly to handwashing with soap and water but also does not always reduce bacterial loads in these contexts. Given the ease of use of the two-step ABHS method, which may increase compliance, the two-step ABHS method should be further evaluated and possibly considered for implementation in the agricultural environment. Taken together, these results provide important information on hand hygiene effectiveness in three agricultural contexts.",

The intervention was associated with increased frequency of handwashes without soap before food contact (+13%, p = 0.017).

Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria and the data were extracted by two teams of independent co-authors for narrative synthesis. Ten studies used digital technology as an intervention tool and two for monitoring purposes. Three main digital technologies were identified including computer games (n = 2), videos (n = 8), and video cameras (n = 2).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the time a diarrhea patient presents at a health facility, the household members of the patient are at higher risk of developing diarrheal diseases (> 100 times for cholera) than the general population. The Cholera-Hospital-based-Intervention-for-7-Days (CHoBI7) is a health facility-initiated water treatment and handwashing with soap intervention designed to reduce transmission of diarrheal diseases between patients and their household members. The present research aimed to (1) develop a scalable approach to integrate the CHoBI7 intervention program into services provided at government and private health facilities in Bangladesh; and (2) tailor the intervention program for the household members of all diarrhea patients, irrespective of the etiology of disease. METHODS: We conducted 8 months of formative research, including 60 semi-structured interviews, 2 group discussions, and a pilot study. Thirty-two interviews were conducted with diarrhea patients and their family caregivers, government stakeholders, and health care providers both to explore existing WASH and diarrhea patient care practices in health facilities and to identify considerations for scaling the CHoBI7 program. Fifty-two diarrhea patient households participated in a pilot study of a modified version of the CHoBI7 intervention program for tailoring. Twenty-eight interviews and 2 group discussions were conducted with pilot households to explore experiences with and recommendations for intervention delivery. RESULTS: The intervention program was modified based on formative research findings. Pilot study participants recognized the benefits of the CHoBI7 intervention program and made suggestions to improve the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Modifications included 1) providing additional pictorial modules, cues to action, enabling technologies, and supplies for safe drinking water and handwashing with soap behaviors in the health facility; 2) switching out technology prone to breaks and leaks as well as sourcing plastic technologies from a high-quality, local manufacturer; and 3) including instructions discouraging the non-use or misuse of technologies and supplies. Considerations for scalability include the local availability and marketing of enabling technologies and supplies, staff for program delivery in health facilities, and potential integration into existing government or health promotion programs. CONCLUSIONS: Formative research identified important considerations for the content, delivery, and scalability of the CHoBI7 health facility-initiated WASH intervention program.",

This study evaluated the effectiveness of CHoBI7 program delivery in increasing handwashing with soap in a healthcare facility setting among diarrhoea patients and their household members. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial of the CHoBI7 program was conducted among 404 diarrhoea patients and their accompanying household members in healthcare facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The 'Standard Message' Arm received the standard message given in Bangladesh to diarrhoea patients on the use of oral rehydration solution. The 'Health Facility Visit + Soapy Water' Arm received the standard message, the CHoBI7 communication module delivered bedside to the patient; and a soapy water bottle in the healthcare facility. The 'Health Facility Visit + Handwashing Station' Arm received this same intervention plus a small plastic handwashing station. Within 24 h of intervention delivery, three-hour structured observation of handwashing practices at stool/vomit- and food-related events (key events) was conducted in healthcare facilities of diarrhoea patients and their accompanying household members. RESULTS: Compared to the Standard Message Arm, there was significantly more handwashing with soap at key events in both the Health Facility Visit + Soapy Water Arm (51% vs. 25 %) (Odds Ratio: 3.02; (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.41, 6.45) and the Health Facility Visit + Handwashing Station Arm (58% vs. 25%) OR: 4.12; (95% CI: 1.86, 9.14). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that delivery of the CHoBI7 communication module and provision of a soapy water bottle to diarrhoea patients and their accompanying household members presents a promising approach to increase handwashing with soap among this high risk population in a healthcare facility setting in Bangladesh.",

Close consideration of handwashing in educational units is important to control and prevent infection transmission. The present study aimed to determine the effect of handwashing education on awareness, attitude and handwashing skills of third-grade elementary school students in Tehran. METHODS: In this study, 76 third grade students of elementary schools located at district 1 of Tehran with the mean age of 9 years were randomly divided into intervention and control groups using pre-test and post-test. Data collection for intervention and control groups was done using a researcher-made awareness- and attitude-gauging questionnaire, along with a checklist of handwashing performance which was completed in cooperation with the health instructor. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that there was a significant difference between the awareness of 3rd-grade students in intervention (69.79 ± 1.61) and control (49.03 ± 1.18) groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, students' attitude toward handwashing improved as a result of education, and the intervention group (62.37 ± 0.65) had a more positive attitude toward hygiene and handwashing compared to the control group (48.45 ± 0.73) (P < 0.05). In the case of handwashing performance, the intervention group (56.76 ± 1.33) had better health performance compared to the control group (40.08 ± 0.67) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Practical training, preparation of educational posters and videos can enhance awareness, attitude and handwashing performance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few intervention studies have focused on how inputs link with outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study tested whether Suaahara I program inputs translated into intended outcomes and identified gaps along the theorized program impact pathway to improved nutrition, care, and water, sanitation, and hygiene behaviors. METHODS: We used household-level, cross-sectional survey data from a process evaluation of Suaahara I conducted in 2014. A total of 480 households with a pregnant woman or child aged <2 y were selected with an equal split between intervention and comparison arms. We used regression models to test associations between exposure to Suaahara I and 3 primary outcomes and 3 parallel knowledge mediators: child minimum dietary diversity, child feeding during illness, and proper handwashing during child care. We used generalized structural equation modeling using full information maximum likelihood to test whether knowledge mediated associations between exposure and outcomes. RESULTS: In the adjusted regression models between maternal exposure to Suaahara I and 3 behavioral outcomes, we found a small positive association for handwashing (β: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.31), but no association with the other 2 outcomes. In the mediation analysis, maternal exposure to Suaahara I, however, was associated with the mediator (knowledge) for all 3 outcomes: handwashing with soap and water (β: 0.05 ± 0.02), child minimum dietary diversity (logit = 0.06; P = 0.03), and child feeding during illness (logit = 0.09 ± 0.02). We found a positive, significant association for the full indirect pathway of program input to output via knowledge for child feeding during illness (logit = 0.07 ± 0.03) only. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to Suaahara I behavior change interventions improved knowledge, but this did not always translate into improved practices. It is important to address barriers to optimal practices beyond knowledge in future nutrition programs in Nepal."

      "abstract": "Poor nutrition and hand hygiene are risk factors for acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Safe drinking water and sanitation can reduce exposure to pathogens and encourage healthy immune responses, reducing the risk of ARIs. Within a trial assessing impacts of water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH), and nutritional interventions, we evaluated effects on ARIs. The WASH Benefits cluster-randomized trial enrolled pregnant women from Kenyan villages and evaluated health outcomes in children born to enrolled mothers 1 and 2 years after intervention delivery. Geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomized into a passive control (no promotional visits), a double-sized active control (monthly visits to measure mid-upper arm circumference), and six intervention groups: chlorinated drinking water (W), improved sanitation (S), handwashing with soap (H), combined WSH, improved nutrition (N) through counseling and lipid-based nutrient supplementation (LNS), and combined WSHN. The main outcome was the prevalence of ARI symptoms (cough, panting, wheezing, or difficulty breathing) in children younger than 3 years. Masking participants was not possible. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Between November 2012 and May 2014, 702 clusters were enrolled, including 6,960 (year 1) and 7,088 (year 2) children with ARI data. The cluster-level intra-cluster correlation coefficient for ARIs was 0.026 across both years. Water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions with behavior change messaging did not reduce ARIs. Nutrition counseling and LNS modestly reduced ARI symptoms compared with controls in year 1 [prevalence ratio (PR): 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-0.99], but no effect in the combined WSHN group weakens this finding.",

We report the results of a program that trained teachers to deliver a handwashing with soap behavior change program to children in primary schools in Bihar, India. Ten intervention schools selected along with ten nearby control schools, and intervention schools received the \"School of Five\" program promoting handwashing with soap using interactive stories, games, and songs, behavioral diaries to encourage habit formation, and public commitment. Households with children aged 8-13 attending the nearby school were enrolled in the study. Handwashing with soap was measured using sticker diaries before eating and after defecation 4 weeks after the intervention was completed. Children in the treatment reported 15.1% more handwashing with soap on key occasions (35.2%) than those in the control group (20.1%) (RR: 1.77, CI: (1.22, 2.58), p = .003). There was no evidence that handwashing with soap after defecation was higher in the treatment group than the control group (RR: 1.18, CI: (0.88, 1.57), p = .265), but there was strong evidence that handwashing with soap was greater in the treatment than in the control before eating (RR: 2.68, 95% CI: (1.43, 5.03), p = .002). Rates of handwashing increased both at home (RR: 1.63, CI: 1.14, 2.32), p = .007) and at school (RR: 4.76, 95% CI: (1.65, 17.9), p = .004), though the impact on handwashing with soap at key occasions in schools was much higher than at home. Promoting handwashing with soap through teachers in schools may be an effective way to achieve behavior change at scale.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children in humanitarian situations are particularly vulnerable to diseases such as diarrhoea. Handwashing with soap can greatly reduce transmission but handwashing rates are often low and traditional interventions ineffective. To aid future intervention design, this study aims to understand the determinants of child handwashing and the key motivational drivers of children's behaviour within a specific humanitarian setting. METHODS: In an internally displaced persons camp in Northern Iraq we conducted a series of 36 friendship-paired interviews with children aged 7-12 years, six semi-structured caregiver interviews, and three semi-structured hygiene promoter interviews. Perceived determinants of child handwashing were explored qualitatively, and motivational drivers were explored quantitatively with children in a rating exercise. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, using an inductive approach, and logistic regression analyses of motive rating data were performed to determine the predicted probabilities of motives being rated as important. RESULTS: Access to soap and water was perceived to be high across all participant groups. Children, caregivers and hygiene promoters all perceive the determinants of child handwashing to be associated with familial role, environmental factors pertaining to location and quality of handwashing materials and facilities, and level of exposure to hygiene promotion, and children also attribute their handwashing to social norms. We find that children in this context are motived most by play and nurture. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of soap and water alone is not sufficient to encourage children to practice handwashing with soap in a humanitarian context. Our findings suggest that equal consideration should be given to the quality and location of handwashing materials and facilities and social norms could be leveraged to promote and enhance child handwashing. Motive-based interventions targeting play or nurture may be a promising approach and are likely most effective when used in conjunction, along with other motivational drivers such as affiliation and love.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively assess the effects of a multi-modal school-based water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) intervention on handwashing behaviour among primary students in North Western (NW) Tanzania. DESIGN: The study was a qualitative assessment of barriers and facilitators to handwashing among students attending primary schools participating in the Mikono Safi Trial (Kiswahili for 'Clean Hands), a cluster-randomised trial assessing the impact of a school-based WASH intervention on selected soil transmitted helminth infections. Data collection methods included in-depth interviews with teachers, focus group discussions and friendship pair interviews with students collected between April and October 2018. The Capability-Opportunity-Motivation and Behaviour model was used to inform data collection and analysis. SETTING: The study was conducted in four purposively selected intervention schools in three districts of Kagera region, NW Tanzania (Bukoba urban, Bukoba rural and Muleba districts). PARTICIPANTS: Participants comprised 16 purposively selected teachers aged between 23 and 52 years and 100 students aged 7-15 years RESULTS: The Mikono Safi intervention increased students' reported capability and motivation to wash their hands with soap at key times, particularly after visiting the toilet. Improvements in students' handwashing knowledge and skills were reported by both teachers and students, and motivation for handwashing was enhanced by emotional drivers such as disgust, fear and nurture. Newly established handwashing stations improved the physical opportunity to wash hands, although the availability of water and the provision of soap was not always consistent (eg, due to internal organisational shortcomings or during the dry season). Students and teachers were actively engaged in intervention implementation which created a school community that valued and supported improved hand hygiene. CONCLUSION: The intervention was successful in improving capability and motivation for handwashing. Handwashing opportunity was also greatly improved, although the supply with water and soap was sometimes interrupted, calling for much stronger multi-sectoral collaboration to improve access to water at schools.

Children aged 5-15 years participated in an intervention delivered to schools in two phases, along with a third phase receiving the intervention after the evaluation, which served as a control. The primary outcome was the number of face washing events that took place when handwashing occurred, which was measured by a 3-hour structured observation at all 67 schools, and a total of 3,871 handwashing events were observed. Differences in observed in face washing behavior between each phase and the control schools were calculated using log-binomial regression with clustering at the school level, whereas survey responses on knowledge of trachoma transmission and prevention were compared using χ2 tests adjusted for clustering at the school level. Face washing during handwashing events was higher in schools after 12 months (59.3%) and 20 months (44.2%) than in control schools (18.7%, P < 0.001). Trachoma knowledge was higher in schools evaluated after 12 months (80%) and 20 months (70%) than in control schools (42%, P < 0.001), and knowledge of some of key preventive behaviors was higher in intervention schools.

These expensive, highly-engineered systems, first developed in London over 150 years ago, have not reached low-income high-risk communities across Asia. Barriers to their implementation in communities at highest risk for cholera include the high capital and operating costs for this technological approach, limited capacity and perverse incentives of local governments, and a decreasing availability of water. Interim solutions including household level water treatment, constructing latrines and handwashing promotion have only marginally reduced the risk of cholera and other fecally transmitted diseases. Increased research to develop and policy flexibility to implement a new generation of solutions that are designed specifically to address the physical, financial and political constraints of low-income communities offers the best prospect for reducing the burden of cholera across Asia.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Improved hand hygiene in contexts with high levels of diarrheal diseases has shown to reduce diarrheal episodes in children under five years. A quasi-experimental multi-country study with matched comparisons was conducted in four rural districts/sub districts in Cambodia, Guatemala, Kenya and Zambia. METHODS: Community oriented interventions including health promotion for appropriate hand washing was implemented in the intervention sites, through community health workers (CHW) and social accountability mechanisms. Community councils were strengthened/established in all study sites. Using household surveys, information on mother's handwashing practices and diarrhea incidence of children 2 weeks preceding the study was obtained. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Access to safe drinking water was reportedly higher for communities in Guatemala and Zambia (> 80%), than those in Cambodia and Kenya (< 63%), with significantly higher levels in intervention sites for Guatemala and Kenya. Improved sanitation was low (< 10%), for Kenya and Zambia, compared to Cambodia and Guatemala (> 40%); intervention sites reporting significantly higher levels, except for Zambia. Hand washing index; hand washing before food preparation, after defecation, attending to a child after defecation, and before feeding children was significantly higher for intervention sites in Cambodia, Guatemala and Kenya (Cambodia, 2.4 vs 2.2, p < 0.001, Guatemala, 3.0 vs 2.5, p < 0.001, Kenya, 2.6 vs 2.3, p < 0.001). Factors significantly associated with lower odds of diarrhea were; mother's marital status, higher educational status, one or more handwashing practices, wealthier quintiles, older (> 24 m), and female children. The findings suggest that caretaker handwashing with soap or ash has a protective effect on prevalence of diarrhea in children.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Helminth and protozoan infections affect more than 1 billion children globally. Improving water quality, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition could be more sustainable control strategies for parasite infections than mass drug administration, while providing other quality of life benefits. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled geographic clusters of pregnant women in rural western Kenya into a cluster-randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01704105) that tested 6 interventions: water treatment, improved sanitation, handwashing with soap, combined water treatment, sanitation, and handwashing (WSH), improved nutrition, and combined WSH and nutrition (WSHN). We assessed intervention effects on parasite infections by measuring Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworm, and Giardia duodenalis among children born to the enrolled pregnant women (index children) and their older siblings. After 2 years of intervention exposure, we collected stool specimens from 9,077 total children aged 2 to 15 years in 622 clusters, including 2,346 children in an active control group (received household visits but no interventions), 1,117 in the water treatment arm, 1,160 in the sanitation arm, 1,141 in the handwashing arm, 1,064 in the WSH arm, 1,072 in the nutrition arm, and 1,177 in the WSHN arm. In the control group, 23% of children were infected with A. lumbricoides, 1% with T. trichiura, 2% with hookworm, and 39% with G. duodenalis. The analysis included 4,928 index children (median age in years: 2) and 4,149 older siblings (median age in years: 5); study households had an average of 5 people, <10% had electricity access, and >90% had dirt floors. Compared to the control group, Ascaris infection prevalence was lower in the water treatment arm (prevalence ratio [PR]: 0.82 [95% CI 0.67, 1.00], p = 0.056), the WSH arm (PR: 0.78 [95% CI 0.63, 0.96], p = 0.021), and the WSHN arm (PR: 0.78 [95% CI 0.64, 0.96], p = 0.017). We did not observe differences in Ascaris infection prevalence between the control group and the arms with the individual interventions sanitation (PR: 0.89 [95% CI 0.73, 1.08], p = 0.228), handwashing (PR: 0.89 [95% CI 0.73, 1.09], p = 0.277), or nutrition (PR: 86 [95% CI 0.71, 1.05], p = 0.148). Integrating nutrition with WSH did not provide additional benefit. Trichuris and hookworm were rarely detected, resulting in imprecise effect estimates. No intervention reduced Giardia. Reanalysis of stool samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed the reductions in Ascaris infections measured by microscopy in the WSH and WSHN groups. Trial limitations included imperfect uptake of targeted intervention behaviors, limited power to detect effects on rare parasite infections, and that it was not feasible to blind participants and sample collectors to treatment status. However, lab technicians and data analysts were blinded to treatment status. The trial was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of improved water quality, sanitation, and handwashing could contribute to sustainable control strategies for Ascaris infections, particularly in similar settings with recent or ongoing deworming programs. Combining nutrition with WSH did not provide further benefits, and water treatment alone was similarly effective to integrated WSH. Our findings provide new evidence that drinking water should be given increased attention as a transmission pathway for Ascaris. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01704105.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The behavioural effect of large-scale handwashing promotion programmes has been infrequently evaluated, and variation in the effect over time has not been described. We assess the effect of a large-scale handwashing promotion programme on handwashing outcomes in a community setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. METHODS: We analysed data from a cluster-randomised trial that included three arms: vaccine-and-behaviour-change intervention (VBC), vaccine-only (V) and no intervention (Control). Data collectors randomly selected different subsets of households each month during the study period and assessed: (i) temporal variation in availability of soap and water at handwashing place; (ii) the use of water and soap by participants when asked to demonstrate handwashing, and; (iii) handwashing behaviour according to structured observation. We used log-binomial regression analyses to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals and compare outcomes by study arms. RESULTS: Data collectors surveyed 9325 households over 28 months. In VBC, there was a significant positive trend on availability of water and soap from baseline to 9 months after the start of the intervention (P-for-trends <0.001), and no significant trend during months 10-28 (P-for-trend = 0.297). In the entire study period, availability of water and soap was higher in VBC (43%) than in V (23%) (PR = 1.92; CI = 1.72, 2.15) and Control (28%) (PR = 1.53; CI = 1.38, 1.69) households. There were no differences between study arms with regard to use of soap during handwashing demonstrations. Observed handwashing with soap after toilet use was higher in VBC (17%) than in V (8%) (PR = 1.47, CI = 0.58, 3.75) and Control (2%) (PR = 3.47, CI = 0.48, 23.33) groups. At other possible pathogen transmission events, the prevalence of handwashing with soap was ≤3%. CONCLUSION: VBC households maintained soap and water for handwashing, but the prevalence of observed handwashing was low in all study arms. The results underscore the need to strengthen scalable behaviour change approaches.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Handwashing prevalence in schools in Kenya is low due to lack of access to water and soap and lack of drive for handwashing. Soapy water made from detergent powder is an inexpensive alternative to bar soap and disgust and social norms change can be powerful drivers of handwashing, but their effectiveness has not been assessed in school setting. In Kenyan public schools, we evaluated an equipment-behavior change intervention's effect on handwashing outcomes. We also monitored functionality of the Povu Poa prototypes to identify design improvements necessary for continued high usage in institutional settings. METHODS: The intervention included the \"Povu Poa\", a new type of handwashing station that dispensed foaming soap and rinse water, combined with school-wide behavior change promotion based on disgust and social norms. In this stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial, we randomly selected 30 schools and divided them into 3 groups of 10. Following baseline data collection, we delivered the intervention sequentially (Group 1: 3-5 weeks after baseline; Group 2: 6-8 weeks; Group 3: 19-24 weeks). We observed outcomes [1] availability of handwashing materials at handwashing places, and; 2) observed handwashing behavior after toilet use among schoolchildren) at baseline and in three follow-up rounds. We compared the outcomes between schools that had received the intervention and schools that had not yet received the intervention. RESULTS: Water and soap/soapy water were available at 2% of school visits before intervention, and at 42% of school visits after intervention.. Before intervention, we observed handwashing with water after 11% of 461 toilet use events; no one was observed to wash hands with soap/soapy water. After intervention, we observed handwashing after 62% of 383 toilet use events (PR = 5.96, 95% CI = 3.02, 11.76) and handwashing with soap/soapy water after 26% of events (PR incalculable). Foaming soap dispenser caps were cracked in 31% of all observations, but were typically still functional. CONCLUSIONS: Our combined equipment-behavior intervention increased availability of handwashing materials and improved the compliance with handwashing after using the toilet, but handwashing with soap was still rare. Equipment durability must be improved for deployment in schools at scale.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soil transmitted helminths (STH) infect >1.5 billion people. Mass drug administration (MDA) effectively reduces infection; however, there is evidence for rapid reinfection and risk of potential drug resistance. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh (WASH Benefits, NCT01590095) to assess whether water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition interventions, alone and combined, reduce STH in a setting with ongoing MDA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In 2012-2013, we randomized 720 clusters of 5551 pregnant women into water treatment, sanitation, handwashing, combined water+sanitation+handwashing (WSH), nutrition, nutrition+WSH (N+WSH) or control arms. In 2015-2016, we enrolled 7795 children, aged 2-12 years, of 4102 available women for STH follow-up and collected stool from 7187. We enumerated STH infections with Kato-Katz. We estimated intention-to-treat intervention effects on infection prevalence and intensity. Participants and field staff were not blinded; laboratory technicians and data analysts were blinded. Prevalence among controls was 36.8% for A. lumbricoides, 9.2% for hookworm and 7.5% for T. trichiura. Most infections were low-intensity. Compared to controls, the water intervention reduced hookworm by 31% (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.69 (0.50,0.95), prevalence difference [PD] = -2.83 (-5.16,-0.50)) but did not affect other STH. Sanitation improvements reduced T. trichiura by 29% (PR = 0.71 (0.52,0.98), PD = -2.17 (-4.03,-0.38)), had a similar borderline effect on hookworm and no effect on A. lumbricoides. Handwashing and nutrition interventions did not reduce any STH. WSH and N+WSH reduced hookworm prevalence by 29-33% (WSH: PR = 0.71 (0.52,0.99), PD = -2.63 (-4.95,-0.31); N+WSH: PR = 0.67 (0.50,0.91), PD = -3.00 (-5.14,-0.85)) and marginally reduced A. lumbricoides. Effects on infection intensity were similar. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In a low-intensity infection setting with MDA, we found modest but sustained hookworm reduction from water treatment and combined WSH interventions. Impacts were more pronounced on STH species with short vs. long-term environmental survival. Our findings suggest possible waterborne transmission for hookworm. Water treatment and sanitation improvements can augment MDA to interrupt STH transmission. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01590095.",

METHODS: We tested stool samples collected at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of age and during diarrhea using quantitative molecular diagnostics for 29 pathogens. We estimated the effects of the WASH, IYCF, and combined WASH + IYCF interventions on individual enteropathogen prevalence and quantity, total numbers of pathogens detected, and incidence of pathogen-attributable diarrhea. RESULTS: WASH interventions decreased the number of parasites detected (difference in number compared to non-WASH arms, -0.07 [95% confidence interval, -.14 to -.02]), but had no statistically significant effects on bacteria, viruses, or the prevalence and quantity of individual enteropathogens after accounting for multiple comparisons. IYCF interventions had no significant effects on individual or total enteropathogens. Neither intervention had significant effects on pathogen-attributable diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The WASH interventions implemented in SHINE (improved pit latrine, hand-washing stations, liquid soap, point-of-use water chlorination, and clean play space) did not prevent enteric infections. Transformative WASH interventions are needed that are more efficacious in interrupting fecal-oral microbial transmission in children living in highly contaminated environments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that drinking water, sanitation, handwashing (WSH), and nutritional interventions would improve environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a potential contributor to stunting. METHODS: Within a subsample of a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in rural Bangladesh, we enrolled pregnant women in 4 arms: control, WSH, child nutrition counseling plus lipid-based nutrient supplements (N), and nutrition plus WSH (N+WSH). Among the birth cohort, we measured biomarkers of gut inflammation (myeloperoxidase, neopterin), permeability (alpha-1-antitrypsin, lactulose, mannitol), and repair (regenerating gene 1β) at median ages 3, 14, and 28 months. Analysis was intention-to-treat. RESULTS: We assessed 1512 children. At age 3 months, compared to controls, neopterin was reduced by nutrition (-0.21 log nmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.37, -.05) and N+WSH (-0.20 log nmol/L; 95% CI, -.34, -.06) interventions; similar reductions were observed at 14 months. At 3 months, all interventions reduced lactulose and mannitol (-0.60 to -0.69 log mmol/L). At 28 months, myeloperoxidase was elevated in the WSH and nutrition arms (0.23-0.27 log ng/mL) and lactulose was higher in the WSH arm (0.30 log mmol/L; 95% CI, .07, .53). CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in permeability and inflammation at ages 3 and 14 months suggest that the interventions promoted healthy intestinal maturation; however, by 28 months, the WSH and nutrition arms showed elevated EED biomarkers. These results underscore the importance of developing a better understanding of EED pathophysiology and targeting interventions early in childhood, when they are likely to have the largest benefit to intestinal health.

METHODS: The participants were 46 preschool children (experimental group, 23; control group, 23). Data were collected from August 7, 2017 to September 20, 2017. The first posttest was carried out on the day after the initial intervention was completed, and the second posttest was performed after a month. Data were analyzed using the x 2 test, Fisher exact test, Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney test, and Friedman test. RESULTS: In the experimental group, the frequency of practicing hand-washing was significantly higher than in the control group on the next day (z=-4.94, p<.001) and after a month (z=-3.15, p=.002). The accuracy of hand-washing was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group on the next day (z=-4.02, p<.001) and after a month (z=-3.86, p<.001). CONCLUSION: The hand-washing program developed in this study was found to be an effective intervention strategy for improving the frequency and accuracy of hand-washing among preschool children."

We evaluated two complementary mass-scale media interventions targeting mothers to increase the frequency of handwashing with soap; one using TV advertising, and the other mobile phone messaging. Television Commercials (TVCs): Mothers of 4-12 year-old children (n = 756) were randomly allocated among four arms: Three different branded TVCs and a fourth, control TVC unrelated to handwashing. TVCs were embedded in blocks of unrelated commercials and shown once a week over four weeks in participants' own homes. Mobile messages: New mothers (n = 598) and mothers of 4-7 year-old children (n = 501) were enrolled in a treatment or control arm. Mothers in the treatment arm received branded mobile phone messages twice weekly for 8 weeks (new mothers) or 4 weeks (mothers of 4-7 year-olds). For TVCs, there were higher rates of handwashing with soap at key occasions in the first (RR: 1.33, p = .002) and second (RR: 1.26, p = .041) of three treatment arms, or 0.4 additional handwashes with soap on key occasions daily. In the mobile study, new mothers (adj-RR: 1.04, p = .035) and general mothers (RR: 1.07, p = .007) receiving the intervention were more likely to wash their hands with soap on key occasions than those in the control group, corresponding to 1.3 and 1.0 more occasions daily. These interventions were associated with significantly greater handwashing with soap, consistent with the hypothesis that branded mass communications can impact habitual lifestyle behaviors relevant to public health.",

A 2-year, enhanced IYCF intervention targeting pregnant women and infants (0-12 months) was implemented in a health zone in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The enhanced IYCF intervention included community- and facility-based counselling for mothers on handwashing, SQ-LNS, and IYCF practices, plus monthly SQ-LNS distributions for children 6-12 months; a control zone received the national IYCF programme (facility-based IYCF counselling with no SQ-LNS distributions). Cross-sectional preintervention and postintervention surveys (n = 650 and 638 in intervention and control areas at baseline; n = 654 and 653 in each area at endline, respectively) were conducted in mothers of children 6-18 months representative of both zones.

DiD [95% CI]: +56.4% [49.3, 63.4], P < 0.001), waiting until 6 months to introduce water (+66.9% [60.6, 73.2], P < 0.001) and complementary foods (+56.4% [49.3, 63.4], P < 0.001), feeding the minimum meal frequency the previous day (+9.2% [2.7, 15.7], P = 0.005); feeding the child in a separate bowl (+9.7% [2.2, 17.2], P = 0.01); awareness of anaemia (+16.9% [10.4, 23.3], P < 0.001); owning soap (+14.9% [8.3, 21.5], P < 0.001); and washing hands after defecating and before cooking and feeding the child the previous day (+10.5% [5.8, 15.2], +12.5% [9.3, 15.6] and +15.0% [11.2, 18.8], respectively, P < 0.001 for all). The enhanced IYCF intervention in the DRC was associated with an improvement in several important IYCF practices but was not associated with a change in dietary diversity (minimum dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet remained below 10% in both zones without significant differences between zones). The provision of fortified complementary foods, such as SQ-LNS, may be an important source of micronutrients and macronutrients for young children in areas with high rates of poverty and limited access to diverse foods. Future research should verify the potential of integrated IYCF-SQ-LNS to improve IYCF practices, and ultimately children's nutritional status.",

      "abstract": "We assessed the impact of handwashing promotion on reported respiratory illness as a secondary outcome from among > 60,000 low-income households enrolled in a cluster-randomized trial conducted in Bangladesh. Ninety geographic clusters were randomly allocated into three groups: cholera-vaccine-only; vaccine-plus-behavior-change (handwashing promotion and drinking water chlorination); and control. Data on respiratory illness (fever plus either cough or nasal congestion or breathing difficulty within previous 2 days) and intervention uptake (presence of soap and water at handwashing station) were collected through monthly surveys conducted among a different subset of randomly selected households during the intervention period. We determined respiratory illness prevalence across groups and used log-binomial regression to examine the association between respiratory illness and presence of soap and water in the handwashing station. Results were adjusted for age, gender, wealth, and cluster-randomized design. The vaccine-plus-behavior-change group had more handwashing stations with soap and water present than controls (45% versus 25%; P < 0.001). Reported respiratory illness prevalence was similar across groups (vaccine-plus-behavior-change versus control: 2.8% versus 2.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.008, 0.006; P = 0.6; cholera-vaccine-only versus control: 3.0% versus 2.9%; 95% CI: -0.006, 0.009; P = 0.4). Irrespective of intervention assignment, respiratory illness was lower among people who had soap and water present in the handwashing station than among those who did not (risk ratioadjusted: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69-0.98). With modest uptake of the handwashing intervention, we found no impact of this large-scale intervention on respiratory illness. However, those who actually had a handwashing station with soap and water had less illness. This suggests improving the effectiveness of handwashing promotion in achieving sustained behavior change could result in health benefits.",

This study evaluated the impact of a school-based handwashing program consisting of two interventions: a hand-hygiene curriculum and group handwashing station. Quantitative and open-ended pre/postintervention surveys were administered to students at one primary school in Kenya ( n = 38) and at one primary school in Uganda ( n = 57). Matching procedures were followed at each school. Paired ttests for pre/postsurveys demonstrated an increase in students' knowledge ( p < .001) and frequency of handwashing ( p < .001). After 6 months, students were still engaging in daily group handwashing. The curriculum increased knowledge, and the handwashing station enabled students to translate their knowledge into action. This study supports educational interventions combined with built environmental interventions should be used to promote handwashing behaviors and emphasizes the role of group handwashing stations.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral economics hold great promise in changing patterns of behavior that influence human health. Handwashing with soap is one such behavior that is important in reducing exposure to pathogens, and in school-age children, handwashing helps reduce absenteeism through the prevention of respiratory and diarrheal diseases. However, the gap between knowledge on the importance of handwashing and actual handwashing practice, especially with soap, persists. Many traditional behavior change communication approaches have failed in achieving and sustaining improved handwashing practices. Cognitive psychology research on habits as well as nudge theory, a component of behavioral economics predicated on the idea of making a behavior as easy as possible to do, suggests that introducing a disruptive cue into the environment may be able to interrupt current habitual neurological patterns to effect and then sustain behavior change. We used a participatory process to identify and introduce a locally appropriate disruptive cue to improve handwashing behavior in schools in Zambia. We then utilized a school-randomized controlled trial to test the soap-on-a-rope in 50 government schools in Namwala District of Southern Province. Two outcomes were considered among school children; washing hands with water and using soap while washing hands. Following the intervention, soap use was more likely in intervention schools than control schools [Odds ratio = 7.23, 95% confidence interval = (1.76-29.71)], though both intervention and control schools saw an increase in handwashing without soap. This low-cost intervention could be scaled throughout Zambia and may work well in other countries of similar circumstances.",

We conducted environmental assessments within a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh that implemented single and combined water treatment, sanitation, handwashing (WSH) and nutrition interventions (WASH Benefits, NCT01590095). After one and two years of intervention, we quantified fecal indicator bacteria in samples of drinking water (from source or storage), child hands, children's food and sentinel objects. In households receiving single water treatment interventions, Escherichia coli prevalence in stored drinking water was reduced by 50% and concentration by 1-log. E. coli prevalence in food was reduced by 30% and concentration by 0.5-log in households receiving single water treatment and handwashing interventions. Combined WSH did not reduce fecal contamination more effectively than its components. Interventions did not reduce E. coli in groundwater, on child hands and on objects. These findings suggest that WSH improvements reduced contamination along the direct transmission pathways of stored water and food but not along indirect upstream pathways. Our findings support implementing water treatment and handwashing to reduce fecal exposure through water and food but provide no evidence that combining interventions further reduces exposure.",

      "abstract": "In humanitarian emergency settings there is need for low cost and rapidly deployable interventions to protect vulnerable children, in- and out-of-school, from diarrhoeal diseases. Handwashing with soap can greatly reduce diarrhoea but interventions specifically targeting children's handwashing behaviour in humanitarian settings have not been tested. Traditional children's handwashing promotion interventions have been school-focused, resource-intensive and reliant on health-based messaging. However, recent research from non-humanitarian settings and targeting adults suggests that theory-based behaviour change interventions targeting specific motives may be more effective than traditional handwashing interventions. In this proof-of-concept study we test, for the first time, the distribution of a modified soap bar, designed to appeal to the motives of play and curiosity, in a household-level, rapidly deployable, handwashing promotion intervention for older children in a humanitarian setting - an internally displaced persons camp in Iraqi Kurdistan. Out of five total blocks within the camp, one was assigned to intervention and one to control. 40 households from each assigned block were then randomly chosen for inclusion in the study and the practice of handwashing with soap at key times was measured at baseline and four weeks after intervention delivery. Children in intervention households received transparent soaps with embedded toys, delivered within a short, fun, and interactive household session with minimal, non-health-based, messaging. The control group received plain soap delivered in a short standard, health-based, hygiene promotion session. At the 4-week follow-up, children in the intervention group were 4 times more likely to wash their hands with soap after key handwashing occasions than expected in the counterfactual (if there had been no intervention) based on the comparison to children in the control group (adjusted RR = 3.94, 95% CI 1.59-9.79). We show that distributing soaps with toys embedded inside, in a rapidly deployable intervention, can improve child handwashing behaviour in a humanitarian emergency context. Further studies are needed to determine the longer-term behavioural and health impact of such an intervention when delivered at a greater scale in a humanitarian context.",

To determine whether water treatment and hygiene practices diffused from maternal health program participants to friends and relatives households in the same communities, we assessed the practices of 106 nonpregnant friends and relatives of these new mothers at baseline and 1-year follow-up. At follow-up, friends and relatives were more likely than at baseline to have water treatment products observable in the home (33.3% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.00001) and detectable free chlorine residual in their water, confirming water treatment (35.7% vs. 1.4%; p < 0.00001).

The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of Unilever's school-based \"School of 5\" handwashing campaign on handwashing with soap (HWWS) in schoolchildren and their mothers in the Indian state of Bihar. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in two districts. We randomized a total of 32 villages with at least one eligible school to intervention and control groups (1:1) and recruited 338 households in each group for outcome measurement. We used structured observation in households to measure HWWS at target occasions (after defecation, soap use during bathing, and before each main meal) in schoolchildren and their mothers. Observers were blinded to intervention status. We observed 636 target occasions (297 in the intervention arm and 339 in the control arm) in mothers and school-going children. After the intervention, HWWS prevalence at target occasions was 22.4% in the control arm and 26.6% in the intervention arm (prevalence difference +4.4%, 95% confidence interval: -4.0, 12.8). The difference was similar in children and mothers. Observers appeared to be adequately blinded to intervention status, whereas observed households were successfully kept unaware of the purpose of observations. To conclude, we found no evidence for a health-relevant effect of the School of 5 intervention on HWWS in schoolchildren and their mothers. Qualitative research suggested that reasons for the low impact of the intervention included low campaign intensity, ineffective delivery, and a model possibly not well tailored to these challenging physical and social environments.",

In a low-income community in urban Dhaka, we piloted and evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of a shared handwashing intervention. This included promotion by community health promoters of a homemade solution of detergent powder mixed with water and stored in a 1.5-L reclaimed mineral water bottle. Community health promoters encouraged sharing of the recurrent detergent cost among compound members. Of 152 participating compounds, fieldworkers randomly selected 60 for qualitative assessment. Fieldworkers conducted 30 in-depth interviews and five focus group discussions among purposively selected compound members. The reclaimed bottles served as an easily accessible dispenser for the soapy water, which could feasibly be retained next to the toilet and kitchen areas for communal use. Bottles functioned as a positive reminder for handwashing at recommended key times. Most compounds (45/60, 75%) shared a common soapy water system and its associated costs. There was reluctance to prepare soapy water for shared use in the remaining 25%. Soapy water was an acceptable hand cleaning agent, with the bottle as a feasible dispenser. It was simple in design, cost-effective, replicable, popular with intervention recipient, and neighboring nonrecipients, and commonly shared among nonrelated households. The need to share expenses and product preparation served as a barrier. Developing a sustainable maintenance system, therefore, is critical to ensuring the public health benefits of handwashing with soap.",
