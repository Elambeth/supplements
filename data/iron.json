      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in paediatric gastroenterology with intravenous iron increasingly utilised. While adult data are published for ferric derisomaltose (FDI), no paediatric data exist. Our aim was to assess the effectiveness and safety profile of FDI in paediatric gastroenterology. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Two UK referral centres (Edinburgh and Sheffield). PATIENTS: All paediatric gastroenterology patients who received FDI from June 2020 to June 2023. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Haematological and biochemical parameters were collected before and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, when available, together with the need for repeated FDI infusions and FDI adverse events. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were identified (54% male; median age 12.8 years, IQR 9.6-15.2), receiving 78 FDI infusions. After a single infusion, 38/59 (64%) patients (effectiveness analysis) completely corrected their anaemia and 6/59 (10%) improved from moderate-severe to mild anaemia. Median haemoglobin increased from 92 (IQR 85-108) to 126 (IQR 115-132) g/L at 1 month (p<0.001) and peaked at 12 months (134 g/L, IQR 125-142; p<0.001) post infusion. A second infusion was performed in 12/59 (20%) patients with 9/12 correcting their anaemia. No significant biochemical alterations, including hypophosphataemia, were detected. Overall, 4/65 (6%) patients (safety analysis) experienced adverse events, with three discontinuing FDI infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our real-world data reveal FDI is rapidly and persistently effective in correcting IDA in paediatric gastroenterology. No significant biochemical alterations or new safety signals were identified."

      "abstract": "The increasing presence of tetracycline antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems poses a critical environmental challenge, necessitating innovative remediation strategies. This study presents the development and characterization of starch-functionalized iron-graphene oxide (SFIGO) and starch-functionalized iron oxide (SFIO) nanocomposites adsorbents for tetracycline removal from water, with emphasis on sustainable synthesis and enhanced performance. Biluochun tea and cassava extract were used as renewable precursors in green synthesis to create a composite material that combines iron oxide's magnetic properties, graphene oxide's high surface area, and starch's biocompatibility. Comprehensive characterization using FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, and XPS revealed SFIGO's unique hierarchical architecture, featuring wrinkled graphene oxide sheets with well-dispersed iron-oxide nanoparticles. Batch adsorption studies demonstrated SFIGO's superior performance, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity of 865.79 mg/g at 298 K, significantly higher than SFIO's 634.83 mg/g. The adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and showed endothermic behavior, with negative Gibbs free energy values, confirming process spontaneity. Multiple binding mechanisms, including π-π interactions, electrostatic attractions, and surface complexation, contributed to SFIGO's enhanced performance. The material demonstrated robust performance across various water matrices and maintained high removal efficiency. These findings advance our understanding of composite materials in environmental remediation and provide a sustainable solution for pharmaceutical pollutant removal."

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd), a pervasive environmental toxicant, poses significant threats to human and animal health through multi-organ toxicity. While ferroptosis has been implicated in Cd-induced pathologies, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cd-mediated nephrotoxicity remain poorly understood. This study elucidates the ferroptosis pathway in CdCl2-exposed PK-15 cells and murine kidney, characterized by iron overload, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which were ameliorated by ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1. Transcriptomic analysis revealed substantial upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) following CdCl2 exposure. Mechanistically, CdCl2 triggered nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (NRF2), subsequently activating HO-1 transcription. Over-activated HO-1 catalyzes the decomposition of heme and releases free iron, accompanied with the degradation of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) induced by CdCl2 exposure, which leads to intracellular iron overload and excessive lipid peroxides production through Fenton reaction, resulting in ferroptosis ultimately. In vivo validation confirmed NRF2/HO-1-mediated ferroptosis in CdCl2-induced murine nephrotoxicity. Both pre-treatment with HO-1 competitive inhibitor Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) and knockout of HO-1 gene remarkably alleviated PK-15 cells against ferroptosis induced by CdCl2 treatment. Our findings demonstrate that Cd exposure initiates NRF2-mediated HO-1 overexpression, driving iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and subsequent ferroptosis. This mechanistic insight provides potential therapeutic targets for mitigating Cd-induced renal damage, advancing our understanding of heavy metal toxicity and its cellular consequences."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic fields (EMFs), as a form of physical therapy, have been widely applied in biomedicine. Iron, the most abundant trace metal in living organisms, plays a critical role in various physiological processes, and imbalances in its metabolism are closely associated with the development and progression of numerous diseases. Numerous studies have demonstrated that EMF exposureinduces significant changes in both systemic and cellular iron metabolism. AIM OF REVIEW: This review aims to summarize the evidence and potential biophysical mechanisms underlying the role of EMFs in regulating iron metabolism, thereby enhancing the understanding of their biological mechanisms and expanding their potential applications in biomedical fields. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: In this review, we have synthesized research findings and proposed the hypothesis that the biophysical mechanisms of EMFs regulate iron metabolism involve the special electromagnetic properties of iron-containing proteins and iron-enriched tissues, as well as the modulation of membrane structure and function, ion channels, and the generation and activity of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Then, the review summarizes the latest advances in the effects of EMFs on iron metabolism and their safety, as well as their impact on immunoregulation, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, orthopedic diseases, diabetes, liver injury, and cancer."

      "abstract": "Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Oral iron is often recommended as first-line treatment, but there is no consensus on the optimal formulation, dosing strategy, or which patients should be treated preferentially with intravenous iron. To address these challenges, the Iron Consortium at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) convened an international panel of 26 experts in haematology, primary care, paediatrics, obstetrics, gastroenterology, cancer, and patient advocacy among its members. This panel was supplemented by insights from a four-person patient focus group to develop current recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel developed clinically relevant questions in five priority topic areas, a systematic literature search was performed, and studies meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables for recommendation development. Evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations were made through a structured anonymous consensus voting process at an in-person meeting in Portland, OR, USA, hosted by OHSU on Feb 16-17, 2024. The expert panel made seven evidence-based recommendations for three demographic groups with iron deficiency: non-pregnant adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, children, and adolescents. Expert opinions supported the recommendations on 21 aspects of care for which there is insufficient evidence. This Review provides evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of iron deficiency, detailing best practices for oral and intravenous iron repletion across diverse patient populations.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotic pollution and its associated resistance genes have emerged as a global environmental and health concern, with widespread detection in various environmental media such as water, soil, atmosphere, and sediment, as well as in organisms. Hence, it is imperative to develop effective remediation technologies for the targeted treatment of antibiotic pollution to mitigate its environmental and health risks. This paper reviews the status of antibiotic pollution in major countries, territories, and regions worldwide. Addressing the risks cause by antibiotics and their resistance genes and achieving efficient remediation of antibiotic pollutants. Additionally, the study explores the issue of antibiotic use and resistance in detail from a global perspective. It provides a critical scientific foundation for controlling global antibiotic resistance through multi-dimensional integrated analysis. In 2021, 4.71 million deaths globally were attributed to antibiotic resistance, with countries such as India and China being the most affected. It also examined the predominant types and sources of antibiotic pollutants, as well as key remediation technologies for addressing antibiotic contamination. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin are commonly found in surface waters at concentrations ranging from 1 to 120 μg L-1. Furthermore, this paper highlighted the distinctive advantages of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in addressing antibiotic pollution, demonstrating removal efficiencies exceeding 90 % under optimal conditions. Our review underscored the pivotal role of iron-based materials and porous biochar in AOPs, showing promising results in various environmental settings. Future research should prioritize the development of multifunctional iron-based composites with improved catalytic stability, environmental compatibility, and recyclability. Moreover, expanding the field-scale application of these materials, particularly in low-resource or high-risk regions, will be essential to translate laboratory successes into global impact. This analysis is designed to inform and guide future initiatives to control and eliminate antibiotic contamination."

      "abstract": "Developing a novel fluorescence carbon-based sensor with high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid response is critical for detecting ferric ion (Fe3+) in beverages and food products. Overcoming this challenge is essential, as excess Fe3+ can cause cellular damage, raising health concerns. Herein, we designed a fluorescence nanosensor utilizing a hybrid iron oxide/carbon dots (HICs) nanocomposite, synthesized from blue pea (BPs) flowers and iron oxide nanoparticles through a hydrothermal treatment. More importantly, the HICs demonstrated high sensitivity and a rapid response to Fe3+, with a linear detection range spanning 0.06 to 100 µM and an impressively low limit of detection (LOD) of 13.61 nM. Moreover, the HICs exhibited remarkable selectivity toward Fe3+, remaining unaffected by various interferences, including common metal ions and small organic molecules. Upon Fe3+ addition, the fluorescence quenching of HICs occurs through a combination of static quenching and dynamic quenching mechanism and the inner filter effect. Additionally, the detection of Fe3+ in milk and herbal drinks was achieved using HICs, yielding satisfactory recovery rates ranging from 94.4 % to 103.7 %. Thus, the developed HICs serve as highly efficient \"turn-off'\" fluorescent nanosensors, exhibiting a rapid response, high sensitivity, and ultra-selectivity for Fe3+ detection, unaffected by matrix interference. These qualities make them promising candidates for advanced detection applications in food products, ensuring food safety."

Salinity increased sodium uptake, generation of reactive oxygen species and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities, leading to a reduction in leaf nutrients and pigments, and organs masses. High salinity significantly decreased the essential oil percentage and yield. However, solid and especially enriched biochars with BNP-MgO, BNP-Fe3O4, and their combined form reduced hydrogen peroxide and consequently enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities under saline conditions. The BNP-MgO was the best treatment for enhancing leaf pigments, and the BNP-Fe3O4 was generally the best choice for improving organs masses and essential oil percentage and yield of chamomile under salinity. Therefore, solid and especially enriched biochars, due to their excellent physicochemical properties, were suggested as the suitable soil amendments to mitigate salt toxicity and improve the growth and essential oil production of medicinal plants in the greenhouse and field cultivations."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely associated, and iron deficiency is highly prevalent in both conditions. However, major cardiovascular and nephrology guidelines offer contrasting recommendations for iron use. We evaluated the effects of iron versus usual care or placebo on the clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials on i.v. or oral iron in patients with CKD (PROSPERO CRD42023453468). We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register from database inception until February 1, 2024 to identify eligible trials. We determined the overall results and stratified them by dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD using random effects models, with certainty of evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary composite endpoint was hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: We identified 45 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Compared with usual care or placebo, iron reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint (1659 events; risk ratio [RR]: 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-0.94; moderate certainty), an effect consistent across dialysis and nondialysis requiring CKD (P-heterogeneity = 0.70). The effect on the primary endpoint appeared driven by both components of hospitalization for heart failure (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61-0.96; moderate certainty) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.65-1.02; low certainty). The incidence of serious adverse events was lower for iron compared with usual care or placebo (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.98; moderate certainty; P-heterogeneity = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Iron therapy may reduce the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients with CKD. Randomized trials evaluating the effects of iron on clinical outcomes are needed, especially in nondialysis patients with CKD with or without anemia."

In this study, we propose a novel in-situ H2S odor control process, which introduced goethite/goethite-fulvic acid (FA) bio-reduction and Fe-based catalysis into activated sludge recycling. This novel process reduced the activated sludge recycling rate from 40 % to 5 %, while increasing the sulfide removal efficiency from 52.97 % to 87.61 %. The sulfide removal capacities were 99.78 mgS/g Fe for goethite and 247.38 mgS/g Fe for goethite-FA. The bio-reduction of recycled sludge further enhanced the sulfide removal capacity to 103.43 mgS/g Fe in goethite and 337.74 mgS/g Fe for goethite-FA. Fulvic acid disrupted crystal structure, reduced electron transfer resistance and increased surface area of goethite, thereby enhancing bio-reduction efficiency and sulfide removal capacity. Moreover, aeration of inlet works further increased the sulfide removal efficiency from 12.67 % to 65.50 % in goethite sludge and from 23.73 % to 87.61 % in goethite-FA sludge. This enhancement was due to the catalytic effect of dissolved and ion-exchangeable Fe, which generated through complexation and electronegativity of recycled Fe-activated sludge. Overall, the novel H2S control process can achieve high sulfide removal efficiency while maintaining low recycling rate and operation costs."

The size, nature, stability, and composition of green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis, XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDX, and TGA analysis. UV-Vis and FTIR analysis were performed to determine the surface plasmon resonance and occurrence of functional groups in the U. rigida-mediated iron oxide nanoparticles. FTIR spectra proved the formation of metal oxide functional groups. U. rigida-mediated iron oxide nanoparticles were spherical in shape with the average size of 50-60 nm and confirmed by FESEM analysis. Crystalline nature of U. rigida-mediated iron oxide nanoparticles was synthesized. A weight loss of 30.1% U. rigida-mediated iron oxide nanoparticles was observed in TGA analysis and confirms its high thermal stability. The study reveals that U. rigida extract can be used for stabilizing agents for fabrication of iron oxide nanoparticles. The synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles may be used in wastewater treatment and drug delivery system."

      "abstract": "Rice (Oryza Sativa L.) is the main food of about half of the people in the world. In order to compare the treatments of iron and zinc nanofertilizers in three irrigation conditions, an experiment was conducted in the form of a split plot based on randomized complete blocks in three replicates on the Tarem Hashemi rice variety. The results of compound analysis showed that the effect of irrigation regime and zinc nano-fertilizer in all traits and the effect of iron nano-fertilizer in all traits except thousand seed weight have significant differences. In the review of the selected treatments for cultivation based on drought tolerance indices, treatments Tr2, Tr5 and Tr11 were selected as suitable treatments for cultivation in conditions of lack of humidity. The results obtained from the polygon diagram indicated that the Tr7 treatment can be selected as a suitable treatment in all three irrigation conditions. In the analysis of the results obtained from the ranking chart of the treatments in terms of traits, the Tr3 treatment was selected as a stable treatment in rice cultivation. In the examination of the diagram to identify the most appropriate treatment based on the ideal treatment, treatments Tr3 and Tr6 under normal conditions and treatment Tr2 under both conditions of irrigation stress were selected as optimal treatments. The grouping of treatments based on traits also showed that Tr8 and Tr9 treatments were very similar in terms of reaction to traits. In general, it can be concluded that in different irrigation conditions, according to the soil quality of the fields, the effect of zinc nano-fertilizer at medium concentration levels can have a favorable effect on increasing the quality of quantitative and qualitative traits of this plant, and low concentration levels of nano-fertilizer Iron can have a positive effect on increasing the quality of the product in the condition of lack of humidity.",

In this study, we explored the anticancer potential of gold-iron oxide (Au-Fe3O4@PEG) nanourchins (NUs), a class of nanoparticles with unique shape, surface features, and plasmonic properties. We tested NUs on several cancer cell lines, including A375 (melanoma), MCF7 (breast), A549 (lung), and MIA PaCa-2 (pancreatic), and observed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity, with A549 cells exhibiting the highest resistance. Our findings also demonstrate that NUs induce oxidative stress, disrupt mitochondrial function, and activate autophagic and paraptotic cell death pathways in A549 lung cancer cells. Additionally, we explored the potential of NUs to enhance the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy, specifically cisplatin, in A549. The results provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of NUs in the context of cancer treatment, particularly for overcoming drug resistance and enhancing the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was clinically documented to be accompanied by iron homeostasis imbalances, however, the causal relationship between them remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between iron homeostasis indicators (serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT)) and NAFLD risk. METHODS: We applied two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the effects of genetic liability to iron homeostasis indicators (N = 43,220-246,139) on NAFLD risk (N = 377,988) in individuals of European ancestry. Reverse direction MR, multivariable MR, and two-step MR were performed to estimate reverse association, causal effects independent of smoking or drinking, and the mediating effect of lipid metabolism, respectively. Smoking and drinking as confounders were considered confounders. RESULTS: Genetically predicted serum iron, ferritin, and TSAT were significantly associated with a higher risk of NAFLD (odds ratio (OR): 1.286, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.075-1.539; p = 0.0059; OR: 1.260, 95% CI: 1.050-1.500, p = 0.0195; and OR: 1.223, 95% CI: 1.067-1.402; p = 0.0039, respectively). Reverse direction MR analysis suggested that genetic liability to NAFLD had no significant causal effect on iron homeostasis. Sex-specific MR exhibited a stronger effect size for the association of elevated ferritin with NAFLD risk in males (OR: 1.723, 95% CI: 1.338-2.219; p = 2.48 × 10-5). Two-step MR revealed that elevated triglycerides (TGs) mediated approximately 3%-5% of the observed effect of serum iron and TSAT on NAFLD risk, while decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) mediated 9%-10%. CONCLUSION: Genetic liability to iron status imbalance may causally affect NAFLD. This evidence may support the clinical treatment of NAFLD in the target population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:  Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) often results from gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is increasingly used to investigate suspected small bowel bleeding, particularly when bidirectional endoscopy is nondiagnostic. However, the diagnostic yield of VCE in asymptomatic patients with IDA and negative bidirectional endoscopy is not well-established, leading to variability in clinical guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients at Brooke Army Medical Center who underwent VCE from January 2019 to April 2023 following negative bidirectional endoscopy for IDA, defined as ferritin <45 ng/mL. We analyzed demographic data, VCE findings, and outcomes, including need for further intervention, persistence of IDA, and hospitalizations. We also assessed the impact of referral delays on outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 238 patients, 75 met the inclusion criteria. VCE revealed abnormal findings in 36% of cases, with 8% having actionable findings necessitating repeat endoscopy. The most common abnormality was small bowel angiodysplasias. No small bowel malignancies were detected. Patients aged over 65 had a higher rate of abnormal findings and actionable lesions. Delays in subspecialty evaluation (>180 days) did not significantly affect patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: In asymptomatic IDA patients with negative bidirectional endoscopy, VCE demonstrates a 36% diagnostic yield, primarily identifying small bowel angiodysplasias, with limited impact on detecting malignancies. This study highlights the importance of individualizing VCE use to each patient, and suggests that delays in referral do not adversely affect outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to refine diagnostic guidelines and enhance cost-effectiveness."

MATERIAL & METHOD: 45 TW, 28 cisgender men (CM) and 18 cisgender women (CW) were prospectively recruited. All participants underwent a 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. QSM post-processing technique was applied to obtain susceptibility value for regions of the caudate, putamen, internal globus pallidus, external globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra pars compacta, substantia nigra pars reticulata, red nucleus, subthalamic nucleus and dentate nucleus. The analysis of covariance was used to investigate the iron deposition differences between three groups controlling for age and education. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used for multiple comparison correction. RESULTS: After correcting for FDR, the TW group showed increased susceptibility value in the left internal globus pallidus compared to the CM group. There were no significantly different susceptibility value between the TW and the CW groups after correcting for FDR. CONCLUSION: The iron deposition in the internal globus pallidus region of TW was higher than that of CM, and there was no significant difference between TW and CW, Further investigation is warranted to gain a more comprehensive understanding of cerebral iron dysregulation in transgender people and its associated physiological mechanisms."

      "abstract": "Fascioliasis is a common hepatic parasitic disease that is caused by Fasciola, resulting in significant economic losses by reducing production and consigning viscera in animals. Currently, there is little research regarding the impact of chemical compounds on the ultrastructure and motility of adult F. hepatica. The present study aims to assess the effect of Vanadate erbium/silver oxide (ErVO4/AgO) and Vanadate iron/silver oxide (FeVO4/AgO) nanoparticles against liver fluke F. hepatica, in vitro assay. Fasciola hepatica adult worms were collected from the livers and gallbladders of sheep and goats centrality of Iran. One hundred fresh worms were incubated with each nanoparticle concentration of 4.5-6 mg/mL FeVO4/AgO and ErVO4/AgO (test, groups) in comparison to triclabendazole 5-20 µg/mL (positive control) and RPMI media culture (negative control) after 12 and 24 hours of treatment. To ensure the reliability of the data, the tests on the sample were performed twice. The effectiveness of these compounds was evaluated by examining parasite movement, reaction to vital stain and changes in the tegument through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using Fisher statistical tests and logistic regression. Analysis of variance was performed to compare Kaplan-Meier and Cox groups and models to analyse parasite survival. In addition, the anthelmintic efficacy was measured as the mortality rate based on the number of live and dead worms. The mortality ratios show that the anthelmintic activities of the compounds highly relied on time and concentration, as time and concentration increased, increasing the mortality rate. Lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of FeVO4/AgO and ErVO4/AgO are 4, 4.7 and 5 mg/mL at 24 h, respectively. FeVO4/AgO showed more lethal effects on F. hepatica than on ErVO4/AgO and triclabendazole. SEM analysis of treated F. hepatica by both nanoparticles at a concentration of 6 mg/mL showed that the tegument surface of fasciola is swollen in some parts, the pores on the tegument surface are completely visible, the sensory papillae are lost, the tegument is severely damaged and the prominent network structure and its vesicles have completely disappeared. F. hepatica is more susceptible to the lethal effects of FeVO4/AgO and ErVO4/AgO nanoparticles. The effectiveness of these compounds depends on the concentration and time of the drug's effect, in such a way that the effectiveness increases with the increase in concentration and time.",

      "abstract": "Chemoresistance poses a significant clinical challenge in managing glioblastoma (GBM), limiting the long-term success of traditional treatments. Here, a 3D tumoroid model is used to investigate the metabolic sensitivity of temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant GBM cells to iron chelation by deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (DFP). This work shows that TMZ-resistant GBM cells acquire stem-like characteristics, higher intracellular iron levels, higher expression of aconitase, and elevated reliance on oxidative phosphorylation and proteins associated with iron metabolism. Using a microphysiological model of GBM-on-a-chip consisting of extracellular matrix (ECM)-incorporated tumoroids, this work demonstrates that the combination of iron chelators with TMZ induces a synergistic effect on an in vitro tumoroid model of newly diagnosed and recurrent chemo-resistant patient-derived GBM and reduced their size and invasion. Investigating downstream metabolic variations reveal reduced intracellular iron, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, reduced viability, increased autophagy, upregulated ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2), arrested proliferation, and induced cell death in normoxic TMZ-resistant cells. Hypoxic cells, while showing similar results, display reduced responses to iron deficiency, less blebbing, and an induced autophagic flux, suggesting an adaptive mechanism associated with hypoxia. These findings show that co-treatment with iron chelators and TMZ induces a synergistic effect, making this combination a promising GBM therapy."

      "abstract": "Cancers of the central nervous system are particularly difficult to treat due to a variety of factors. Surgical approaches are impeded by the skull-an issue which is compounded by the severity of possible harm that can result from damage to the parenchymal tissue. As a result, chemotherapeutic agents have been the standard of care for brain tumors. While some drugs can be effective on a case-by-case basis, there remains a critical need to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents for neurological cancers. Recently, advances in iron oxide nanoparticle research have highlighted how their unique properties could be leveraged to address the shortcomings of conventional therapeutics. Iron oxide nanoparticles combine the advantages of good biocompatibility, magnetic susceptibility, and functionalization via a range of coating techniques. Thus, iron oxide nanoparticles could be used in both the imaging of brain cancers with magnetic resonance imaging, as well as acting as trafficking vehicles across the blood-brain barrier for targeted drug delivery. Moreover, their ability to support minimally invasive therapies such as magnetic hyperthermia makes them particularly appealing for neuro-oncological applications, where precision and safety are paramount. In this review, we will outline the application of iron oxide nanoparticles in various clinical settings including imaging and drug delivery paradigms. Importantly, this review presents a novel approach of combining surface engineering and internal magnetic targeting for deep-seated brain tumors, proposing the surgical implantation of internal magnets as a next-generation strategy to overcome the limitations of external magnetic fields."

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced inflammatory responses can result in a number of adverse effects, including cancer. Natural mineral sulfur, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) and nontoxic sulfur (NTS) suppress inflammatory responses. The present study hypothesized that MSM and NTS may inhibit LPS‑induced inflammatory responses in THP‑1 human monocytes. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting assays were performed to analyze the molecular signaling pathways associated with sulfur‑treated and untreated cells. A comet assay was used to evaluate DNA damage, flow cytometry was performed to analyze cell surface receptors and chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to examine molecular interactions. Notably, LPS‑induced inflammation increased iron/heme metabolism, whereas MSM and NTS inhibited this effect. Furthermore, LPS treatment activated the Toll‑like receptor 4/NF‑κB signaling axis, which was downregulated by NTS and MSM. These sulfur compounds also suppressed the nuclear accumulation of LPS‑induced NF‑κB, which could induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF‑α, IL‑1β and IL‑6. Finally, MSM and NTS inhibited LPS‑induced reactive oxygen species generation and DNA damage in THP‑1 monocytic leukemia cells. These results suggested that natural sulfur molecules may be considered promising candidates for anti‑inflammation studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown a significant correlation between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cardiac fibrosis, yet the precise detrimental effects and underlying mechanisms of PM2.5 exposure on cardiac fibrosis remain incompletely understood. Cardiac remodeling, a process involving ferroptosis that can be initiated by iron overload, has been implicated in this phenomenon. In this study, we sought to explore the potential mechanism by which ferroptosis contributes to PM2.5-induced cardiac fibrosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to ambient PM2.5 by intratracheal instillation twice a week for 12 weeks to establish PM2.5-exposed murine models and cardiomyocytes were used to verify the role of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced cardiac fibrosis. In this study, it was observed that exposure to PM2.5 resulted in cardiac fibrosis and a significant upregulation of cardiac fibrosis-related markers (TGF-β1, collagen-I and p-Smad3), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and ACSL4 (a biomarker for ferroptosis). Additionally, PM2.5 exposure led to a decrease in heme content, iron overload, increased levels of the lipid peroxidation marker 4-HNE, and a reduction in the ratio of GSH/GSSG and GPX4 (a biomarker for ferroptosis) in murine hearts. Significantly, the use of ferrostatin-1 (an inhibitor of ferroptosis) mitigated PM2.5-induced cardiac fibrosis and decreased the levels of cardiac fibrosis-related markers (TGF-β1, collagen-I and p-Smad3) in murine hearts, indicating the essential role of ferroptosis in the development of cardiac fibrosis. In vitro experiments showed that PM2.5 upregulated the expression of HO-1 protein, promoted iron accumulation, increased 4-HNE levels, and triggered ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. The inhibition of HO-1 (zinc protoporphyrin 9) and siRNA HO-1 effectively mitigated PM2.5-induced iron overload, ferroptosis, and heme accumulation in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, treatment with ferrostatin-1 markedly decreased the expression levels of cardiac fibrosis-related markers, such as TGF-β1 and p-Smad3. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our study showed that the activation of ferroptosis/TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, initiated by heme degradation-induced iron overload in cardiomyocytes, serves as a mechanism in murine models of PM2.5-induced cardiac fibrosis."

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex clinical syndrome that affects approximately 13.3 million people worldwide each year. Although ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathological progression of AKI, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) plays a role in apoptosis, autophagy and oxidative stress induction in renal tubular epithelial cells; however, the specific mechanisms through which ALR is involved in AKI are unclear. The present study investigated the effects of ALR on regulating iron uptake and ferroptosis in AKI under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Renal tubular epithelial cell-specific Alr knockout (AlrKO) mice and ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced AKI in vivo models were generated. ALR overexpression and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced AKI in vitro models were generated using human renal tubular epithelial cells. The effects of ALR on ferroptosis and kidney function in AKI were investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies involving biochemical analysis, RT-qPCR, western blotting assay, immunofluorescence assay, and transmission electron microscopy. Transcriptome sequencing, iron homeostasis, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) synthesis detection were performed to investigate the mechanisms through which ALR affects AKI. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that kidney tubule-specific Alr knockout in mice exacerbated iron uptake, ferroptosis, and acute kidney I/R injury. Mechanistically, we found that ALR could regulate iron homeostasis through the iNOS/NO/Solute carrier family 39 member 14 (SLC39A14) pathway to reduce ferroptosis in AKI. The results of this study reveal a previously undescribed function of ALR in iron homeostasis and ferroptosis in AKI, and suggest that targeting ALR could be a potential treatment option for AKI."

Here, we present a Ga/Zn diatomic nanozyme (Ga/Zn-NC) with a well-defined geometric structure and electronic configuration designed to emulate peroxidase and glutathione oxidase with exceptional catalytic activities, enabling cascade catalysis. We demonstrate that the formation of Ga-Zn metal bonding is essential for accelerating electron transfer and reducing the reaction energy barrier, thus enhancing the catalytic performance. Within the tumor microenvironment, the catalytic actions of Ga/Zn-NC induce oxidative damage and sensitize breast cancer cells to ferroptosis. Concurrently, the release of gallium from Ga/Zn-NC with \"pseudo-iron\" activity disrupts iron metabolism and activates a self-amplifying ferroptosis pathway, synergizing with the enzyme's catalytic activity to potentiate ferroptosis and apoptosis, thereby achieving remarkable efficacy against tumors."

This study investigates the MRI-detectable effects of whole-brain irradiation across all neuroanatomical structures in adult mice, with a specific focus on T2* MRI measurements, to evaluate regions that may be particularly sensitive to iron accumulation. Methods: One year following irradiation or sham treatment, mice were imaged with a 7T MRI to evaluate changes in regional volume and T2* relaxation times across more than 652 neuroanatomical using the DSURQE mouse brain atlas. Results: Statistical analysis identified 301 altered regions with respect to regional volume and 85 regions with respect to T2* relaxation showing significant differences relative to the control group (p < 0.05). Further data refinement, including the consolidation of redundant, bi-lateral structures revealed 18 subregions with significant changes in both volume and T2*. The data refinement revealed that the most represented system was the olfactory system (8/18 regions, 44%). The olfactory regions also showed the most pronounced changes and greatest correlation between the two metrics. Conclusions: These findings are suggestive that ionizing radiation may cause a pronounced disruption in the olfactory system that coincides with potential iron accumulation."

In this study, a ferritin/ferroportin-hijacking nanoplatform (Fe3O4-ART@MM-Hep) containing artemisinin (ART) and hepcidin (Hep) is fabricated to boost intracellular free iron ions and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm. Once the tumor site is reached, the hepcidin targeted binds to FPN and triggers the internalization and degradation of FPN, blocking the efflux of intracellular iron ions. Meanwhile, artemisinin induces lysosomal degradation of ferritin, liberating the endogenous iron. Combined with exogenous iron supplemented by Fe3O4, the nanoplatform facilities the generation of ROS. What's more, the released Fe2+ catalyzes artemisinin to generate carbon-centered free radicals, further enhancing tumor killing ability. All of the above strategies trigger an ROS storm in tumor cells and indicate a promising platform for high-performance ferrotherapy."

This study aims to investigate the potential of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as contrast agents for improved detection of diffuse brain cancer. We examine the distribution and pharmacokinetics of SPIONs in glioblastoma models with intact and disrupted blood-brain barriers. Using MRI, we imaged RN1-luc and U87MG mice injected with Gadovist and SPIONs, observing differences in blood-brain barrier permeability. Peripheral imaging showed strong uptake of nanoparticles in the liver and spleen, while vascular and renal signals were transient. Susceptibility gradient mapping enabled positive nanoparticle contrast within tumours and provided additional information on tumour angiogenesis. This approach offers a novel method for detecting diffuse brain cancer. Our findings demonstrate that SPIONs enhance glioblastoma detection beyond conventional MRI, providing insights into tumour angiogenesis and opening new avenues for early diagnosis and targeted treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Chemodynamic therapy (CDT), which utilizes the catalytic reactions of nanoparticles to inhibit tumor growth, is a promising approach in cancer therapy. However, its efficacy is limited by insufficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration in tumor microenvironments and unsatisfactory enzymatic catalytic activity. To overcome these limitations, ultra-small iron-based (USIB) nanoparticles with cascaded superoxide dismutase (SOD)-mimic and peroxidase (POD)-mimic activities have been engineered. USIB nanoparticles initiated by SOD-mimic activity to transform superoxide anions (O2·-) into H2O2, elevating H2O2 levels in the tumor microenvironment and subsequently utilizing POD-mimic activity to convert H2O2 into the more reactive ·OH, thereby achieving the destruction of tumor cells. In addition, USIB nanoparticles possess photothermal conversion capabilities, and their enzymatic activity can be significantly enhanced under mild laser irradiation. Therefore, by addressing the issues of insufficient substrate concentration and low enzymatic catalytic activity, the therapeutic efficiency of CDT has been improved. Our research integrates the cascade catalytic reactions of nanozymes with laser irradiation, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and exhibiting outstanding biosafety, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential."

Yet, the disparity in intrinsic activity is often attributed to thermodynamics, but few studies focused on the electronic structure between different metals. Herein, transition metal catalysts in the form of single-atom M-N4 moieties moored to graphitic carbon nitride (denoted MSA CN, M = Fe, Co, and Cu) are developed and used for activating PMS for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol. Remarkably, FeSA CN achieves a catalyst-dose-normalized kinetic rate constant of 34.2 L min-1 g-1, surpassing reported systems by 2-551 times ─ even at ultralow catalyst (0.06 mg L-1) and PMS (0.2 mm) concentration. The in situ formation of surface-bound PMS* complexes enabled the degradation of 4-chlorophenol to achieve unprecedented utilization efficiency (≈100%) through highly efficient non-radical pathways. Density functional theory calculations revealed that large spin polarization of Fe-N-C sites facilitated the d orbitals to overlap with the PMS on the metal active sites and promoted electron transport, thereby facilitating PMS adsorption and enhancing the oxidation capacity. This work establishes a mechanistic foundation for designing a single Fe-atom catalyst/PMS system in Fenton-like water treatment."

However, it is unclear whether these symptoms are associated with gastrointestinal motility. This study aimed to explore the correlation between oral iron preparations that cause nausea and vomiting with gastrointestinal motility. Sodium ferrous citrate (SFC), a common ingredient in iron preparations, was used in this study. Gastrointestinal motility in mice was measured using the 13C-octanoic acid breath test to determine gastric emptying and colonic transport capacities using the bead expulsion test. SFC significantly delayed gastric emptying. However, it did not affect the colonic transport capacity. Treatment with the antiemetic palonosetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor inhibitor, abolished the gastric evacuation retardation effect of SFC. However, the additive in the SFC formulation, palonosetron alone, did not affect the gastric emptying capacity. These results suggest that iron preparations cause vagal nausea and vomiting in the upper gastrointestinal tract due to chemical stimulation of the gastrointestinal blood with a concomitant reduction in gastric emptying capacity. Knowledge of the association of delayed gastric emptying with the onset of iron-induced nausea is useful for understanding iron-induced adverse effects.",

In this study, four groups of laboratory-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) with different configurations were constructed to evaluate the removal efficiency of iron-carbon (Ic) coupled constructed wetland microbial fuel cells (CW-MFC) system for different pollutants removal and bioelectricity production. The results showed that the addition of Ic significantly promoted the removal of contaminants. The maximum removal rates of COD, TN, NH4+-N, and TP were 86.13 %, 81.60 %, 79.07 %, and 97.35 %, respectively. In particular, the removal rates of TC reached 100 %. 3D-EEM analysis further confirmed the role of Ic in promoting organic degradation. The Ic-CW-MFC system also showed superiority in power generation performance with peak power density of 7.90 mW/m2 (internal resistance is 10 Ω), 88.07 % higher than the traditional CW-MFC, while the internal resistance was 68.21 % lower. Therefore, when Ic is used as the substrate of CW-MFC system, its decontamination and electricity generation performance is the best. Analysis of RDA was used to elucidate the relationship of four CWs, dominant strains and environmental factors (pH, ORP and DO). The performance of traditional CWs decreased significantly after TC addition (5-20 mg/L), but Ic-CW-MFC could effectively alleviate the inhibition effect caused by high-concentration TC wastewater. The working mechanism of Ic-CW-MFC in TC wastewater was further analyzed through typical cycle experiment and characterization. The results showed that Ic-CW-MFC is an efficient and economical wastewater treatment technology, which has great potential application value in the treatment of wastewater containing TC."

Iron-deficiency anemia is common in CRC patients and is associated with fatigue and weakness. This study investigated the effects of iron-deficiency anemia on the outcomes of surgical resection of CRLM. METHODS: This population-based, retrospective study evaluated data from adults ≥20 years old with CRLM who underwent hepatic resection. All patient data were extracted from the 2005-2018 US National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. The outcome measures were in-hospital outcomes including 30-day mortality, unfavorable discharge, and prolonged length of hospital stay (LOS), and short-term complications such as bleeding and infection. Associations between iron-deficiency anemia and outcomes were determined using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Data from 7,749 patients (representing 37,923 persons in the United States after weighting) were analyzed. Multivariable analysis revealed that iron-deficiency anemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of prolonged LOS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.30-3.30), unfavorable discharge (aOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.83-3.19), bleeding (aOR, 5.05; 95% CI, 2.92-8.74), sepsis (aOR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.04-2.46), pneumonia (aOR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.72-3.74), and acute kidney injury (aOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.24-2.35). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent associations between iron-deficiency anemia and prolonged LOS across age, sex, and obesity status categories. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing hepatic resection for CRLM, iron-deficiency anemia is an independent risk factor for prolonged LOS, unfavorable discharge, and several critical postoperative complications. These findings underscore the need for proactive anemia management to optimize surgical outcomes."

      "abstract": "BackgroundIron deficiency and anaemia are prevalent in people undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), necessitating effective iron supplementation. While oral iron is often preferred for its accessibility and cost, it may be insufficient or poorly tolerated. Intravenous (IV) iron is generally well tolerated and associated with improved haemoglobin response and reduced erythropoiesis-stimulating agent requirements, yet optimal dosing, administration intervals, and haematological targets remain under-researched, particularly in PD populations. Current prescribing practices vary significantly, reflecting gaps in evidence and consensus. This study aimed to evaluate UK clinical practices for iron therapy in PD and estimate patient eligibility for a future randomised controlled trial (RCT).MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted among UK-based kidney clinicians using a structured 9-item questionnaire distributed electronically via the UK Kidney Association. The survey explored iron repletion strategies, diagnostic thresholds, and circumstances for withholding therapy. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for free-text responses.ResultsA total of 41 clinicians from 23 dialysis units participated, including consultants (73.2%), registrars (17.1%), and specialist nurses (9.7%). High-dose IV iron (≥500 mg per visit) was the preferred strategy for 65.9% of respondents, while none used oral iron alone. Most clinicians initiated iron therapy when serum ferritin was <200 µg/L (53.7%) or transferrin saturation (TSAT) was <20% (78.1%). Diagnostic measures beyond serum ferritin and TSAT, such as reticulocyte haemoglobin content, were rarely used (14.6%). The majority avoided iron therapy in the presence of active infection (90.2%) or IV iron allergy (92.7%). Estimates of trial eligibility indicated that 6-10% of people receiving PD might not meet inclusion criteria, largely due to elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, or TSAT levels.ConclusionsThis survey highlights significant variability in iron therapy practices for people receiving PD in the UK. Most clinicians favour high-dose IV iron, reflecting its practical advantages in outpatient settings. However, diagnostic and safety concerns remain, with limited use of advanced biomarkers and inconsistent thresholds for therapy initiation. These findings underscore the need for a robust RCT to address gaps in evidence, establish optimal iron repletion strategies, and ensure safe and effective anaemia management in PD populations."

The improvement of crop cultivation techniques to promote the quality of the final product is imperative nowadays for ensuring sustainable and successive agricultural production, especially for medicinal and aromatic plant species. The present study examined the impacts of foliar application of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) on Sideritis cypria plants grown in hydroponics. The spraying of Fe (1.79 mM and 10.79 mM) and Zn (1.74 mM and 10.43 mM Zn) was applied four times at 10-day intervals, and the effects on plant growth, plant physiology, antioxidant status and nutrient uptake were investigated. The applications of both the high Fe and Zn levels decreased the plant yield and dry matter content. The use of the high Fe levels, particularly, resulted in elevated oxidative stress, as indicated by the increased levels of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide production and the increased peroxidase enzymatic activity. The application of the high Fe levels (10.79 mM Fe) also induced the plants' non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms and the total flavonoid content. All foliar applications increased the accumulation of sodium in the leaf tissue. The plants' calcium content was increased after the treatment with Zn, while the magnesium content was increased only when the high Zn level (10.43 mM Zn) was applied. Interestingly, the foliar application of both Zn and Fe had no effect on the build-up of zinc or iron content in the leaf tissue. Biofortification with minerals is a key approach to enhancing the biological quality and the nutritional value of plants, while its foliar application or application via different fertigation strategies needs to be evaluated either as single or as combined practices."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Iron deficiency anaemia is common in patients recovering from major surgery and is associated with poorer post-operative outcomes. We designed a randomized controlled trial treating post-operative anaemia with iron therapy to observe the influence on post-operative recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anaemic patients (haemoglobin [Hb] < 120 g/L for women, Hb < 130 g/L for men) recovering from major abdominal surgery at Fiona Stanley Hospital were recruited. Patients were double-blind randomized 1:1 to ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) or saline administered 4 weeks post-discharge and included in a 12-week exercise programme. Iron indices, quality of life (QoL) questionnaires and muscle function tests were conducted at 4 weeks (baseline), 8-, 12- and 16-weeks post-discharge. This pilot study primarily aimed to assess the feasibility of recruiting 20 patients per intervention arm. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12622001447741. RESULTS: Of 205 eligible patients screened between 5 May 2023 and 31 August 2023, only four patients were recruited, of which one completed the study. After randomization to FCM, results obtained from the sole participant that completed the trial suggested a trend towards improvement in QoL outcomes, Hb and muscle function. CONCLUSION: Recruitment to a randomized controlled trial exploring the influence of iron therapy on muscle function after major abdominal surgery was not feasible."

The coupled ICME enriched ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) and denitrifying bacteria (DB) in the mixed sludge on the 76th day of the present experiment. Stable operation was achieved on the 78th day. The COD and TN removal rates during the operation were 86.20 % and 87.12 %, respectively, while the control group (without iron and carbon) had removal rates of 74.30 % and 60.31 % which were 11.9 % and 26.81 % higher, respectively. Notably, the abundance of AnAOB in the system increased from 0.44 % to 1.43 % during the operation from day 76 to day 100. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that Candidatus_Kuenenia was a key anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacterium. Based on the experimental results, the ICME process could rapidly enrich anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria to change the microbial community structure of the sludge under the water quality conditions of industrial wastewater and increasing the tolerance of certain DB and Candidatus_Kuenenia to water quality. By combining with iron‑carbon, the rapid modification of mixed sludge was achieved, and the iron‑carbon micro-electrolysis coupled denitrification anaerobic ammonia oxidation process was established, which provides a certain reference value for treating industrial wastewater.",

While iron supplementation is routinely used to manage anemia in CRC patients, it may also impact gut microbiota and promote tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of initial gut microbiota composition on iron-promoted tumorigenesis. We performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in ApcMin/+ mice using samples from healthy controls, CRC patients, and mice, followed by exposure to iron sufficient or iron excess diets. RESULTS: We found that iron supplementation promoted CRC and resulted in distinct gut microbiota changes in ApcMin/+ mice receiving FMT from CRC patients (FMT-CRC), but not from healthy controls or mice. Oral treatment with identified bacterial strains, namely Faecalibaculum rodentium, Holdemanella biformis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, and Alistipes inops, protected FMT-CRC mice against iron-promoted tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that microbiota-targeted interventions may mitigate tumorigenic effects of iron supplementation in anemic patients with CRC.",

S2 achieved the fastest sludge growth, reaching 1106 μm by day 80 (87.14% larger than control S0). During stable operation, S2 exhibited superior pollutant removal: 95.96% COD, 100% NH4+-N, and 79.53% TN removal, alongside the highest aerobic denitrification rate (9.93 mg·gVSS⁻¹·h⁻¹, 71.68% above S0). Comparatively, S1 showed slightly lower efficiencies (94.20% COD, 100% NH4+-N, 71.50% TN) and denitrification activity (8.35 mg·gVSS⁻¹·h⁻¹). Microbial analysis revealed enriched Bacteroidota phyla and sustained Zoogloea genus abundance in FONP-PAC reactors. Higher iron oxide loading enhanced interspecies electron transfer, accelerating granule growth and nitrogen removal. Larger granules in S2 promoted stratified microbial niches, improving oxygen gradient-dependent processes like simultaneous nitrification-denitrification. These findings demonstrate that optimized FONP-PAC dosing strengthens sludge structure and metabolic synergy, achieving dual benefits of rapid granulation and high-efficiency nutrient removal through physicochemical-microbial interactions. The study provides insights into nano-material mediated AGS enhancement for wastewater treatment optimization.HighlightsThe threshold effect of nano-iron oxide loading on the granulation rate of AGS (Anaerobic Granular Sludge) was revealed.The mechanism by which FONP-PAC (Functionalized Oxide Nanoparticles-Polymeric Aluminum Chloride) promotes interspecies electron transfer through a conductive network was elucidatedA strategy for the targeted enrichment of Thauera and Zoogloea by the material was proposed."

Serum iron profiles total iron, TIBC, ferritin, transferrin, and hepicidin were determined. Moreover, MDA, GSH, and NO levels and GPx, and SOD activities were also determined. Levels of gene expression of GPX4, Nrf2, DMT1, ACSL4, and caspase3 genes were evaluated by using RT-qPCR. Finally, histopathological examination of rat heart tissues of different groups was done. After rutin treatment, our results revealed that TIBC, ferritin, transferrin, hepicidin, MDA&NO were significantly decreased, while GSH level and GPx&SOD activities were significantly increased. Also, rutin exerting its protective role by increasing GPX4&Nrf2 expressions and decreasing DMTN, ACSL4, and caspase3 expressions.

      "abstract": "Major gynaecological surgery is a significant risk factor for intra and postoperative blood loss. Effective iron deficiency (ID) and anaemia management is critical for ensuring patient safety. The aim of this update was to take an in-depth look at two recently published studies focusing on the assessment and management of ID and anaemia in subgroups of patients undergoing gynaecological surgery from the CARENFER PBM (2023) and PERIOPES (2023 and 2024) studies. Among the 6999 patients included in the three studies, 354 involved gynaecological procedures. Within this cohort, the prevalence of preoperative ID ranged from 70 % to 78 %, with 88 % considered absolute ID, while preoperative anaemia affected 28 %-59 % of women. Indeed, several gynaecological conditions that require surgery (e.g., uterine fibroids and gynaecological malignancies) are frequently associated with significant blood loss. Nonetheless, preoperative iron workup was only performed in 5 %-33 % of the patients. Furthermore, anaemia and/or ID were only treated in 12.5 %-24 % preoperatively and 25 % postoperatively. In conclusion, there seems to be a need to optimise perioperative ID and anaemia management in gynaecologic surgery by ensuring systematic preoperative screening and treatment for anaemia and/or ID and, wherever feasible, postponing surgery if restoration of the blood mass and iron stores is considered necessary prior to surgery."

This study thus analyzed IO-related genes (IORGs) in WH, offering possibilities for developing new therapeutic strategies. Differential gene expression (DEGs) analysis was conducted between the WH group and intact skin (IS) group, intersected with IORGs to obtain differentially expressed IORGs (DE-IORGs). Functional enrichment analysis and potential drug screening were performed on DE-IORGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DE-IORGs was constructed, and hub genes were identified using CytoHubba and MCODE methods. ROC curves of hub genes were plotted, and their expression levels in WH and IS groups as well as inter-gene correlations were analyzed. Additionally, immune infiltration variances in WH and IS groups, along with miRNA and TFs of hub genes, were examined. Finally, the effect of EGFR on skin wound healing was verified by scratch healing assay. 39 DE-IORGs were predominantly enriched in signaling pathways like HIF-1 signaling pathway and Th17 cell differentiation. Potential drugs for treating WH (e.g., felbamate, SA-94315, GANT-58, rucaparib) were identified. Three hub genes related to IO in WH were pinpointed (HIF1A, CDKN2A, EGFR) with diagnostic value. Immune infiltration analysis showed higher levels of immune cells like endothelial cells and macrophages in the WH group. Additionally, 55 miRNAs (e.g., hsa-mir-200a-3p, hsa-mir-218-5p) and 2 TFs (L3MBTL2, ZNF76) regulating the three hub genes were predicted. Cell experiments showed that EGFR could promote skin wound healing. The study suggested HIF1A, CDKN2A, and EGFR as potential diagnostic biomarkers for effective WH diagnosis, offering new insights into identifying potenti1al therapeutic targets for WH treatment.",

Here, we design hollow Cu-enriched Prussian blue-based nanostructures (Cu-HMPBs) and find that the infected microenvironment facilitates the release of Cu ions from Cu-HMPBs, leading to Cu overload in bacterial cells. Meanwhile, Fe ions in bacterial cells are highly selectively chelated, triggering iron starvation. As a result, the proteotoxic stress and redox imbalance induced by Cu overload are aggravated upon iron starvation, thus remarkably enhancing cuproptosis-like bacterial cell death at extremely low-dose (noncytotoxic) Cu ions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this iron starvation-augmented antimicrobial strategy, and its efficacy is further validated in a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-infected diabetic mouse wound model. Collectively, these findings provide a promising and universal strategy on iron starvation sensitizing cuproptosis-like bacterial cell death for combating drug resistance.",

Oral candidiasis superimposed on OLP can worsen the patient's symptoms and obscure the true clinical appearance making the treatment of OLP more complex and difficult. The aim of this study was to investigate the salivary iron level in OLP patients undergoing topical steroid therapy with a history of oral candidiasis compared with OLP patients undergoing topical steroid therapy without a history of oral candidiasis and healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 68 OLP patients treated with a topical steroid were divided into 34 OLP patients with a history of oral candidiasis, 34 OLP patients without a history of oral candidiasis and 34 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from the participants to determine the salivary iron level and to investigate the presence of oral Candida colonization. RESULTS: The salivary iron level was significantly higher in OLP patients undergoing topical steroid therapy with a history of oral candidiasis compared with OLP patients undergoing topical steroid therapy without a history of oral candidiasis and healthy individuals (P = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the Candida colony count in OLP patients undergoing topical steroid therapy with a history of oral candidiasis was significantly higher compared with OLP patients undergoing topical steroid therapy without a history of oral candidiasis and healthy Individuals (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: High salivary iron level associates with a high amount of oral Candida colonization in OLP patients undergoing topical steroid therapy with a history of oral candidiasis.

However, disruptions in brain iron metabolism can lead to iron buildup, which occurs with aging and is linked to several brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, have the highest capacity to store iron, which is stored intracellularly within ferritin complexes. Importantly, women are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and experience faster disease progression compared to men.MethodsWe used postmortem brain samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease and small vessel disease patients of both sexes for immunohistochemical studies. Samples were stained with the Prussian blue method to visualize iron deposits and with antibodies against the microglia marker Iba1 and ferritin light chain.ResultsOur study reveals that the number of iron deposits and the levels of ferritin light chain in microglia are positively correlated in men with Alzheimer's disease, but negatively correlated in women. There is no correlation between brain iron deposition and ferritin in samples from patients with small vessel disease of both sexes.ConclusionsThese results could inform more tailored approaches to the treatment and management of Alzheimer's disease based on sex-specific differences in brain iron metabolism and microglial iron storage capacity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a prevalent health issue globally, with numerous research studies indicating that teenage girls in impoverished nations have a high incidence of this condition. Thus, the goal of this study is to figure out how education grounded in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) can prevent IDA in female high school students. METHODS: In Shiraz, Iran, 160 girls between the ages of 14 and 19 participated in this quasi-experimental study. Random sampling was used, and participants were randomly allocated to two experimental and control groups (each having 80 members). A questionnaire formed on the TPB was used as the data-collecting method, and both groups completed it pre- and four months post intervention. The educational program for the experimental group had six 50-60 min sessions that were conducted in schools using three different teaching styles (speaking, question and answer, and group discussion). After putting the data into the SPSS-24 statistical program, paired t, independent t, and chi-square tests were used to look at them. RESULTS: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of attitude (P = 0.213), subjective norms (P = 0.451), perceived behavioral control (P = 0.216), behavioral intention (P = 0.212), or behavior (P = 0.547). However, following the intervention, there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of the mentioned constructs (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In the present study, education based on the TPB could successfully affect the nutritional behaviors for preventing IDA in girls aged 14-19 years. Probably, the results of this research can be used for students and their families and provide information for designing and planning interventions to prevent this disease among students at the disposal of subordinate organizations such as education, schools, universities of medical sciences, health centers, and nutrition clinics.",

      "abstract": "The biological treatment using sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is considered highly promising for heavy metal stabilization and immobilization because of its low cost and high efficiency. In this study, the immobilization of Cd2+ and Pb2+ in mine wastewater and soil was performed using Clostridium sulfidigenes HY-1 and iron-based nanoparticles. The immobilization efficiency of the combination of C. sulfidigenes HY-1 and iron-based nanoparticles was much greater than the HY-1 strain or iron nanoparticles alone; the combination of C. sulfidigenes HY-1 with nFe0 displayed synergistic effects that resulted in the highest immobilization rate. The immobilization rate of C. sulfidigenes HY-1 combined with nFe0 reached 89.3 % and 97.8 % for Cd2+ and Pb2+, respectively, with a reaction time of 5 days, added concentration of 250 mg/L nFe0, pH 7.0, and an initial Cd2+ and Pb2+ concentrations of 3 and 20 mg/L. Furthermore, the products for immobilization were confirmed as CdS, PbS, and FeS. Subsequently, the combination of C. sulfidigenes HY-1 with nFe0 was applied to immobilize Cd2+ and Pb2+ in mine wastewater and soil, with significant remediation effects observed for the removal of heavy metal ions. This research describes an effective, eco-friendly, and promising technology for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated environments in mining areas.",

The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the therapeutic response and tolerability of intravenous (IV) iron sucrose and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) administered to pregnant women with IDA. The present prospective observational study was conducted among 334 pregnant women who were in the second or third trimester of pregnancy with moderate to severe IDA and who were treated with IV iron sucrose or FCM at a large tertiary care center between April, 2018 and March, 2024. The therapeutic response was assessed by analyzing the increase in hemoglobin (Hb) and serum ferritin levels at 3 and 6 weeks following the first dose of IV iron treatment. Tolerability was assessed by analyzing the adverse events to drug administration. A statistically significant increase in the mean Hb and serum ferritin levels was observed in both the iron sucrose and FCM groups at 3 and 6 weeks post-infusion (P<0.0001 for all); however, the increase in the FCM group was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than that in the iron sucrose group. Minor temporary adverse drug reactions were comparable (P=0.232) between the both treatment groups, with no major serious adverse events observed in any group. IV iron sucrose and FCM both were efficacious and well tolerated in pregnant women with moderate to severe IDA during the second and third trimester. However, there was an improved overall response to FCM as it caused a greater increase in the Hb and serum ferritin levels than iron sucrose. Therefore, FCM is recommended as an effective and safe alternative to iron sucrose for the treatment of IDA during pregnancy."

While intravenous (IV) iron is recognized for its role in chemotherapy-induced anemia, its efficacy in broader palliative oncology settings is underexplored. Our study provides real-world experience with IV iron in cancer patients, particularly those receiving supportive care alone. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at an integrated oncology center in Hong Kong from January 2019 to August 2023. Patients who received IV iron were evaluated for changes in hemoglobin (Hb) and transfusion requirements. Results: Among 283 eligible episodes, mean Hb increased from 7.6 g/dL at baseline to 8.8 g/dL and 9.3 g/dL by days 28 and 60, respectively (ps < 0.001). Mean units of packed cells transfused per patient declined by 55% within to 12 weeks following IV iron (P = 0.01). Among 164 (58%) patients receiving supportive care alone, Hb rose from 7.3 g/dL to 8.3 g/dL on day 28 (P < 0.001), with a 62% reduction in transfusions (P = 0.04). Adverse reactions were observed in 4 patients (1.1%), none with significant consequences. Baseline Hb, treatment intent and iron deficiency group significantly predicted Hb change on day 28 in multiple linear regression. Conclusion: IV iron significantly improved anemia and reduced transfusion requirements in cancer patients with anemia, including those receiving supportive care. To our knowledge, this study presents the largest dataset on IV iron use in cancer patients receiving supportive care to date. Future studies should explore its effect on symptoms management, quality of life and health-economic benefits."

      "abstract": "Iron deficiency (ID) is a top five leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years in women of reproductive age around the world. Despite its enormous health burden, no screening guidelines exist for the detection and treatment of ID in women of reproductive age. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening versus no screening for ID in women of reproductive age in the United States. A lifetime simulation of women of reproductive age was conducted using a Markov cohort model under three strategies: (1) no screening, (2) screening at a ferritin threshold of 15 μg/L, and (3) screening at a ferritin threshold of 25 μg/L, from the US health system perspective, and at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Epidemiologically informed ID prevalence estimates sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were employed for model parameterization. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, in $/QALY). Base-case results for the three strategies accrued $209 700, $210 200, and $210 200 discounted lifetime costs and 23.6, 24.0, and 24.4 discounted lifetime QALYs, respectively. Screening at a ferritin threshold of 25 μg/L was the cost-effective intervention with an ICER of $680/QALY (95% credible interval $350-$750/QALY). In dual base-case analyses examining intravenous rather than oral iron repletion for treatment, screening at a ferritin threshold of 25 μg/L remained the cost-effective intervention with an ICER of $2300/QALY (95% CI $1800-$3800/QALY). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, screening at a ferritin threshold of 25 μg/L was the cost-effective intervention in 100% of 10 000 second order Monte Carlo iterations."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to consolidate existing evidence on the impact of maternal anaemia on the risk of IUGR. We conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science until 28 February 2024. Eligible studies included observational designs that reported maternal anaemia and its association with IUGR or small for gestational age (SGA) outcomes. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic. The R software (version 4.3) was used for statistical analyses. A total of 38 studies involving 3,871,849 anaemic and 27,978,450 non-anaemic pregnant women were included. The pooled analysis demonstrated that anaemia in pregnancy is associated with a significantly increased risk of IUGR (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.05-1.62, I² = 97%). Subgroup analyses by anaemia severity showed non-significant associations for mild (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.58-1.23) and moderate anaemia (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.48-1.98), while severe anaemia indicated a higher, though non-significant, risk of IUGR (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.69-2.93). Maternal anaemia is associated with a heightened risk of IUGR, highlighting the critical need for effective management and early intervention strategies within prenatal care settings. Future research should focus on elucidating the effects of different severities of anaemia on birth outcomes, including IUGR and long-term effects later in life."

      "abstract": "Bacteria involved in iron cycle and electroactivity are commonly found in intensified constructed wetlands (CWs) with iron-carbon substrates. However, their roles in nitrogen (N) removal remain unclear. Here, two types of CWs with different filling modes (separate and mixed) of sponge iron and biochar substrates under micro-oxygen regulation (2 h/d, 60 mL min-1) were constructed for nitrogen removal for 240 days. The results revealed that CWs amended with iron-biochar substrates separately (CW-D) achieved a higher total nitrogen removal performance (81 %) and lower greenhouse gas emission (global warming potential reduced by 3.07 × 105 μg CO2-eq m-2h-1) compared with Fe-C micro-electrolysis CWs (CW-E). In this process, although 41 genera of nitrogen-transforming bacteria (NTB) were detected in CWs, no NTB members had a significant difference (P < 0.05) in relative abundance between CW-D and CW-E. However, 11 genera of iron-cycling bacteria (ICB, e.g. Pseudomonas) with electroactive and 5 genera of electroactive bacteria (EAB, e.g. Tetrasphaera) were significantly enriched in CW-D and CW-E, respectively, both showing significant negative correlations (P < 0.05) with NO2--N content. It indicated that ICB and EAB rather than specific NTB members were decisive in N removal in iron and carbon CWs in low C/N ratio wastewater treatment and regulated by filling modes. Our findings expand the knowledge of the application of iron and carbon substrates in CWs and provide an initial assessment of the effect of different filling modes of iron and carbon on nitrogen removal in CWs.",

      "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition underpins soil-atmosphere carbon exchange and is regulated by climate change-mediated variations in soil redox conditions. Periodic anoxia, commonly occurring following precipitation, soil flooding, and erosion events, is assumed to preserve SOC. Yet, water saturation may also increase SOC decomposition relative to unsaturated conditions, and contradictory findings among previous studies remain unexplained. Here, using incubation experiments on 20 soils collected across a 24° latitude gradient in China, we show that 70% of the soils showed a higher or similar anoxic decomposition rate of SOC compared to the oxic treatment, indicating fast SOC loss under relatively short anoxia. Methane production was far lower than CO2 due to the presence of alternative terminal electron acceptors (TEAs). Variation in alternative TEAs and microbial community shows that fast anoxic decomposition was primarily driven by iron (Fe) reduction, which accounted for up to 90% of anoxic CO2 production. Meanwhile, positive relationships among water-extractable organic carbon (OC), hydrochloric acid-extractable ferrous Fe, relative abundance of Fe-reducing prokaryotes, and the SOC decomposition rate suggest the release of readily metabolized substrates following Fe reduction. This release provided substrates for anoxic metabolism and potentially led to the loss of OC protected by Fe (Fe-bound OC; a slow-cycling OC pool under oxic conditions). Mass balance calculation confirms that Fe-bound OC loss was mostly similar to elevated anoxic SOC decomposition in magnitude, and random forest modeling indicates that soils rich in reducible Fe, SOC, and Fe-reducing prokaryotes most likely experience elevated SOC decomposition under periodic anoxia. Overall, our findings demonstrate that fast anoxic decomposition of SOC is a potentially important pathway that may stimulate SOC loss under climate change-mediated intense hydrologic regimes, particularly for soils rich in reducible Fe and SOC.",

Fish (31.6 ± 0.33 g) were distributed across 16 tanks in four quadruplicate treatment groups. A control diet without CSM, a diet containing 15% CSM (CSM), a diet with 15% CSM plus 1 × 108 cfu/g of S. cerevisiae (CSMY), and a diet with 15% CSM plus 1 × 108 cfu/g of iron-enriched S. cerevisiae (CSMYFE) were fed to the treatment groups. After 8 weeks of feeding, there were no significant differences in growth performance, feed efficiency, total/differential leukocyte counts, plasma iron concentration, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and hepatic antioxidant and histological characteristics among the treatment groups. Blood erythrocyte counts and hematological indices were similar across treatments, but the CSM group exhibited significantly lower blood hematocrit (p = 0.005) and hemoglobin (p = 0.002) levels compared to the other treatments. Hepatic iron concentration was significantly higher in the CSMYFE group than in the other treatments (p = 0.001). Hepatic gossypol concentrations in the CSM, CSMY, and CSMYFE treatments were similar and significantly higher than that of the control treatment (p  < 0.001). Plasma total antioxidant capacity (p = 0.002) and ascorbate level (p = 0.025) were significantly elevated in the CSMY and CSMYFE groups compared to the other treatments. In conclusion, a dietary inclusion of 15% CSM as an alternative to soybean meal does not negatively affect fish growth performance, hepatic histology, or antioxidant parameters; however, it does result in decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels while increasing hepatic gossypol levels. The inclusion of S. cerevisiae, whether iron-enriched or nonenriched, mitigates the decreases in blood hematocrit and hemoglobin levels and enhances hepatic antioxidant parameters."

BAR11 pretreatment significantly suppressed Valsa mali infection in apple (Malus domestica); however, its molecular function remained unclear, as did the mechanisms governing the response of the apples to BAR11 treatment. Here, we demonstrate that BAR11 functions as a ferritin, defined by a conserved four-helical bundle structure, and enhances oxidative stress tolerance in actinomycetes. Confocal microscopy revealed that BAR11 was secreted and delivered into apple cells, where it sequestered labile ferrous iron (Fe2+) and inhibited iron uptake. Notably, BAR11 treatment and iron deficiency induced nearly identical transcriptional reprogramming of iron homoeostasis-related genes in apple roots and similar resistance phenotypes, suggesting that BAR11 triggers a low iron-mimicry state, which potentiates apple immunity. Transcriptomic analysis further supported that BAR11 disrupted the expression of iron homoeostasis-related genes while activating that of defence-related ones. Moreover, the apple WRKY family transcription factor MdWRKY40 responded robustly to BAR11 and low-iron treatments and positively modulated BAR11-induced resistance against V. mali. Our findings reveal a paradigm wherein actinomycete ferritins act as cross-kingdom immune elicitors by disrupting iron homoeostasis in apple, providing a mechanistic foundation for iron-targeted biocontrol strategies."

      "abstract": "Currently, chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Drug resistance in AML cells is a critical factor contributing to the failure of chemotherapy remission and subsequent relapse. Iron overload frequently occurs in AML patients because of hematopoietic suppression or supportive blood transfusion therapy. Previous studies have indicated that iron overload may promote the progression of AML; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our results demonstrate that, compared with TP53-wild-type AML cells, TP53-mutant AML cells exhibit increased resistance to cytarabine-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, reducing TP53 expression in wild-type AML cells diminishes their sensitivity to cytarabine. The TP53 signaling pathway is essential for mediating cytarabine-induced apoptosis in AML cells. In this study, an iron overload model in AML cells via the use of ferric citrate is constructed. Our data indicate that iron overload can suppress the TP53/BCL2/BAX signaling pathway, counteracting cytarabine-induced apoptosis. In TP53 wild-type AML cells, TFR1 participates in iron-mediated resistance to cytarabine by regulating the entry of iron into the cells. These findings provide a foundation for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms involved in AML resistance to cytarabine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: More than 60% of women of reproductive age in Odisha, India are anemic. The national long-term efforts in reducing anemia have focused mostly on the supply side, with a paucity of campaigns on the demand side. Social norms serve as significant determinants of human behavior, but there are few interventions that adopt a social-norms approach to reducing anemia. An intervention was implemented to change descriptive, injunctive, and collective social norms to improve iron folic acid consumption behaviors among women of reproductive age. METHODS: A longitudinal cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to collect data at baseline, six months later at midline, and a year after that at end-line. All villages in our study area were formed into clusters, randomly assigned to either the treatment (50 clusters with 130 villages) or the control (39 clusters with 109 villages) arm. Women were eligible for inclusion if they aged between15 and 49, spoke Odiya, and did not plan to move in the next year. Women living in treatment communities received the intervention package that comprised community-based education sessions, health communication videos, and hemoglobin testing. RESULTS: Data analyses included 2,061 women in the treatment arm and 2,049 women in the control arm enrolled in the trial at baseline. Hierarchical linear models revealed that all three types of social norms improved significantly more in treatment than in control communities (all p's < 0.001) at midline. Two of the norms (descriptive and collective but not injunctive norms) predicted iron folic acid consumption at end-line. The relative improvement in iron folic acid consumption over time was significantly greater in treatment communities (p <.001). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that a social norms-based intervention can change longer-term iron and folic acid consumption behaviors to reduce anemia. Future practice may merit having norms-based strategies to promote adherence to micronutrient supplementation and medical guidelines among women. This demand-side approach will be particularly useful in resource-limited settings where the health system is inadequately prepared to procure and distribute supplements. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI) (CTRI/2018/10/016186) on 29 October 2018."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a major pathogen in hospitals, causing a notable rise in bloodstream infections among inpatients. Its growing resistance to multiple drugs limits treatment options. This study aims to examine the antibacterial effects of gallium nitrate [Ga(NO3)3] against A. baumannii and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: 40 strains of A. baumannii with different antimicrobials susceptibility patterns were isolated from bloodstream infections. The in vitro antibacterial activity of Ga(NO3)3 was analyzed by micro-dilution method and time-kill assay. The influence of ferric chloride/hemin on the antibacterial efficacy of Ga(NO3)3 was investigated. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to elucidate the antibacterial mechanism of Ga(NO3)3. A mouse infection model was conducted to assess its in vivo performance. RESULTS: Ga(NO3)3 exhibited a potent antibacterial effect in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% human serum, with MICs ranging from 0.06 μg/mL to 0.125 μg/mL. The antibacterial activity of Ga(NO3)3 was found to be dose- and time- dependent. However, the antibacterial effect of Ga(NO3)3 was partially compromised in the presence of exogenous ferric chloride/hemin. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that Ga(NO3)3 exerted its antibacterial effect by up-regulating the expression of genes associated with siderophore biosynthesis and transport, while simultaneously disrupting multiple iron-dependent metabolic processes. Ga(NO3)3 treatment significantly reduced bacterial load in vivo using a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on the antibacterial mechanisms of Ga(NO3)3 against A. baumannii, suggesting its potential as a promising antibacterial drug for treating bloodstream infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.",

      "abstract": "The optimal way of oral iron replacement for iron deficiency anaemia(IDA) is still unknown and few recent studies have reported better fractional absorption and tolerability of intermittently administered iron. This randomised, active comparator controlled, open-label trial evaluated efficacy and tolerability of 120 mg elemental iron (2 × 200 mg ferrous sulphate tablets) administered as a single dose on alternate days (alternate-day arm, ADA) vis-à-vis 60 mg elemental iron (single FeSO4 tablet) administered daily (daily arm, DA), among women (age ≥ 18 years) having IDA, with haemoglobin (Hb) concentration between 6 and 10 g/dL and serum ferritin < 30 µg/L. Primary outcome was the Hb change on Day-28. Secondary outcomes included Hb change on Day-56, change in serum hepcidin levels from baseline to Day-14, adverse effects (AEs) and compliance to treatment. Sixty-eight participants (34 each in DA and ADA) were enrolled in the trial. Hb change at Day-28 was significantly higher in the ADA compared to DA (mean change: +2.2 ± 1.3 vs. +1.3 ± 1.1 g/dL, p = 0.003). Though Hb increment at Day-56 was also higher in ADA, it was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in changes in serum hepcidin from baseline to Day-14 between the arms. Significantly higher proportion in the DA had AEs compared to ADA (45% vs. 9%, p < 0.005). However, treatment compliance was not significantly different between the arms. Alternate-day oral iron replacement led to significantly higher haemoglobin increment in the short run and caused significantly lesser AEs compared to daily replacement. Larger multicentric RCTs with longer duration of intervention should evaluate alternate-day replacement vis-à-vis daily therapy in future. This randomised controlled trial has been registered in Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI Reg. No.: CTRI/2021/12/038370, dated 2nd December 2021)."

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of iron amino acid chelated (AACI) preparation versus ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) in treatment of iron deficiency anemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, clinical study was conducted on one hundred and sixty children aged 5-13 years old proved to have iron deficiency according to guide lines of WHO, 2001. All included children were subjected to the following laboratory investigations: CBC, reticulocytic count, CRP, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), serum ferritin (SF), and serum hepcidin. Patients were assigned to two treatment regimens on randomized base 1:1 either to supplement with (AACI) or (FAC) once daily at bedtime. The subjects were followed up for eight weeks. RESULTS: At the end of the study, group 1 who received AACI had increase in: Hb from 9.9 ± 1.1to 11.5 ± 0.3 gm/l(p = 0.01), MCV(fl) from 63.57.7 ± to 69 ± 6.3 (p = 0.05), serum iron from 49.5 ± 5.8 to 87 ± 12.7ug/dl(p = 0.001), serum ferritin from26.2 ± 10.5to 116.4 ± 19.7ng/ml(p = 0.001) while in group 2 who received FAC, there was increase in: HB from10.1 ± 1.7 to 11.2 ± 0.8, (p = 0.1), MCV from 64.5 ± 8.02 to 73.2 ± 8.9 (p = 0.01), serum iron from 48.2 ± 3.5to74 .3 ± 15 ug/dl (p = 0.01) and serum ferritin from 28.1 ± 9.3 to 84.3 ± 15.2 ng/ml (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our study showed much improvement in iron status indices in AACI preparation with no significant statistically difference between it and FAC."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common health problem. The hepcidin hormone is the main regulator of systemic iron balance. The body responds to IDA by decreasing hepcidin. This study investigated how different iron supplementation regimens affect hepcidin levels in women with IDA. 87 female participants aged 18-45 years with hemoglobin < 10 g/dL and serum ferritin < 20 ng/ml were assigned to receive iron therapy every other day, once daily, or twice daily. Hemogram, serum iron, serum iron binding capacity, ferritin, hepcidin, and C-reactive protein values were measured at baseline and on the 15th and 90th days of treatment in all groups. On the seventh day, no significant difference was found between the once-daily and twice-daily groups (p = 0.42) in reticulocyte counts. By the 15th day, hemoglobin and MCV levels showed significant improvement in the twice-daily group compared to the other groups (p < 0.01). At the third month, ferritin levels were significantly higher in the twice-daily group compared to the every-other-day and once-daily groups (p = 0.03). No significant differences were observed in hepcidin levels at three months across all groups. The study concludes that twice-daily iron supplementation results in the most significant hematological improvements but with increased gastrointestinal side effects. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring iron dosing schedules to individual patient needs. In cases where rapid haemoglobin response is required, twice-daily dosing may provide superior results. Conversely, once-daily dosing may be preferred if tolerable anemia can be maintained. Every other day dosing, although associated with fewer side effects and better tolerability, may not provide adequate support for erythropoiesis.

Natural food dietary diversification with foodstuffs prepared at home using locally available ingredients could be helpful to counter childhood anemia. In this open-labelled randomized controlled trial, 82 consecutive children aged 6-11 years diagnosed with moderate iron deficiency anemia were randomized into two groups. Children in the control group received 3 mg/kg/day of elemental iron orally in a syrup form, for eight weeks. In addition to the oral iron syrup in the same dose, the intervention group received one sesame jaggery ball (containing 60 g of sesame seeds and jaggery each) for eight weeks. The increases in hemoglobin (Hb) at 4 and 8 weeks were estimated as the primary outcomes. The increases in serum ferritin and body weight at eight weeks were measured as the secondary outcomes. The increase in the median Hb levels of the intervention group at four weeks [0.9 (0.6, 1.5) Vs 0.8 (0.4, 1.2), p-0.045] and eight weeks [1.7 (1.0, 2.4) Vs 1.3 (0.6, 2.0), p-0.013] were statistically more significant than the control group. Likewise, the increase in the serum ferritin levels [10.7 (6.4, 16.7) Vs 6.2 (4.6, 13.3), p-0.015] and body weight [0.8 (0.3, 1.4) Vs 0.1 (-0.4, 0.6)] in the intervention group were significantly more than in the control group. Besides routine oral iron syrup, daily supplementation of sesame jaggery balls in moderate iron-deficient anemic children improves their iron status."

This study aimed to examine the association between periodontitis and iron metabolism disorders, and to analyze the characteristic changes of iron metabolism in periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 79 Stage III/IV periodontitis patients and 79 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Periodontal clinical parameters, system inflammation markers, iron metabolism parameters and hematological parameters were collected and compared at baseline and 3 months after non-surgical periodontal therapy. RESULTS: Stage III/IV periodontitis patients exhibited higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers including white blood cell (WBC) counts and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs- CRP). Serum hepcidin and ferritin were significantly increased in the periodontitis group, meanwhile serum iron and transferrin were significantly decreased. Periodontal therapy attenuated the higher levels of hepcidin and ferritin, and the lower levels of Fe and transferrin in periodontitis patients at 3 months after therapy. Probing depth (PD), bleeding index (BI) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) were positively correlated with hepcidin and ferritin, and negatively correlated with Fe and transferrin respectively. Hepcidin was significantly negatively correlated with Fe and positively correlated with ferritin in periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the association between periodontitis and iron metabolism disorders and indicate that periodontitis-activated host responses may increase the risk of iron metabolism disorders, while meaningfully provide new insights into the systemic effects of periodontitis."

The successful incorporation of nZVI onto the BCZo was verified through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, which revealed significant modifications in the surface oxygen-containing functional groups. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the adsorption characteristics and performance of nZVI-BCZo for Cd(II) and As(III). Under optimal conditions (pH 6.0, temperature of 310 K, and an adsorption time of 360 min), the maximum adsorption capacities for Cd(II) and As(III) were found to be 28.09 mg/g and 186.99 mg/g, respectively. The influence of pH on removal efficiency was more pronounced than that of temperature, with nZVI-BCZo exhibiting a higher affinity for As(III) compared to Cd(II). Kinetic analysis showed that the adsorption process is primarily controlled by chemical adsorption and follows a monolayer adsorption mechanism. Regeneration tests demonstrated that nZVI-BCZo retained good adsorption capacity after three cycles, with adsorption efficiencies of 67.78 % for Cd(II) and 53.04 % for As(III), indicating its potential for repeated use in water treatment applications. The economic evaluation revealed that nZVI-BCZo has a lower processing cost. Therefore, this study established nZVI-BCZo as an efficient, reusable, and cost-effective adsorbent for the treatment of heavy metal-laden water.",

Objective: This study aims to investigate the prevalence of these deficiencies in overweight/obese children and to assess the correlation between vitamin D/serum iron levels and body mass index (BMI). Methods: The observational study was conducted on 69 Romanian overweight and obese children, aged 2 to 17, admitted to the Pediatrics Department of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Hospital in Bucharest over a 15-month period. The age- and gender-specific BMI percentiles were used to classify participants into three groups: overweight (≥85th and <95th BMI percentile), obese (≥95th BMI percentile), and severely obese (>120% of 95th BMI percentile). Data analysis focused on identifying the need for screening and targeted treatment in this pediatric population. Results: Hypovitaminosis D (defined as a serum level of 25(OH)D < 30 ng/mL) prevalence was significantly higher in the severe obesity category (71.5%) compared to the obesity (69%) and overweight (61.5%) groups. Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia were both more prevalent in overweight children, with rates of 50% and 38.5%, respectively. Negative moderate correlations were found both between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and children's age (r = -0.444, p-value < 0.0001), as well as between serum 25(OH)D levels and BMI (r = -0.31, p = 0.015), with no statistically significant correlation between serum iron level and BMI in this cohort (r = -0.02, p > 0.05). Conclusions: Severe obesity could be regarded as an associated factor for vitamin D insufficiency as this is highly prevalent in severely obese children, with 25(OH)D levels decreasing with the increase in BMI. Overweight children demonstrated an increased prevalence of iron deficiency in the overweight category, suggesting that the adipose tissue contributes to chronic inflammation, disrupting iron homeostasis. Given the high prevalence of nutritional deficiencies in this population, implementing systematic screening and treatment programs would be beneficial to prevent long-term adverse outcomes.",

A total of 94 newborn piglets, selected from 8 healthy sows, were randomly allocated into 4 treatment groups during the lactation period, receiving injections of normal saline without iron (CON, n = 23), intramuscular dextran injection of bound iron at 2 mL (200 mg Fe) on postnatal day 3 (PND 3) (FeDex, n = 24), oral supplementation from PND 2 to 13 with 10 g of FerkoFer® containing 2.2 g Fe per day (FeOra, n = 23), or both FeDex and FeOra (FeDPO, n = 24). Piglets were weighed individually at birth and PND 21. Blood samples were collected on PNDs 1, 7, 14, and 21. Piglets in the CON group had lower body weight on PND 21 compared with piglets in the FeDex, FeOra, and FeDPO groups (0.46-1.05 kg decrease, p < 0.05), while piglets in the FeDPO group had the highest weaning weight across all groups (p < 0.05). The levels of hemoglobin (HGB) and serum iron (SI) in FeDPO piglets were significantly higher than in all other groups on PNDs 14 and 21 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the red blood cell (RBC) levels in the FeDPO and FeOra piglets were significantly higher than that in FeDex piglets on PND 21 (p < 0.05). In addition, serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in both FeOra and FeDPO piglets were significantly higher than those of piglets in CON and FeDex piglets on PND 21 (p < 0.05), whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) content in FeDex piglets was higher than that in CON piglets (p < 0.05). Collectively, the current results indicate that the combination of intramuscular injection and oral supplementation is a more effective strategy to improve the growth performance of suckling piglets, associated with higher hemoglobin and serum iron levels, as well as the optimal redox status."

Emerging therapies that stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) show promise in counteracting follicular degradation and supporting hair regrowth. This communication highlights the potential of iron chelators, specifically deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (DFP), to stabilize HIF-1α by reducing iron availability, thereby promoting vascularization, cellular proliferation, and a regenerative environment in the hair follicle niche. Clinical trials with iron chelators demonstrated improvements in hair density, thickness, and elasticity, as well as a reduction in hair loss by up to 66.8% over six months. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of iron chelators in autoimmune alopecia management. Future research should explore the synergistic use of iron chelators with immune-modulating therapies, positioning them as viable options in the evolving field of alopecia treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the pulmonary effects induced by the inhalation of menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosols on asthma exacerbation, despite the popularity of these devices and flavors among youth and young adults. In the lungs, matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) expressed and secreted by both alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells plays an essential role in airway remodeling, a key feature of severe asthma. In this study, we investigated the role of MMP12 in menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosol exposures plus house-dust mite (HDM)-induced asthmatic responses. METHODS: We exposed wild-type (WT) and MMP12 knockout (KO) juvenile female mice to well-characterized menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosols followed by either PBS or HDM treatment, and evaluated pulmonary outcomes in terms of iron metabolism, oxidative stress responses and pulmonary inflammation. RESULTS: We found high levels of iron in the menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosol. This correlated with e-cigarette + HDM WT mice exhibiting disruption of pulmonary iron metabolism, suggesting a defense mechanism against iron-mediated toxicity. This was evidenced by altered lung protein concentrations of ferroportin, ferritin, lactoferrin, and transferrin, activation of the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway and up-regulated expression of NQO1 in e-cigarette + HDM WT mice. Further, despite decreased neutrophilic inflammation, MUC5AC, an oxidative stress inducible mucin, was increased in the e-cigarette + HDM WT mice. In contrast, MMP12 KO mice were protected against iron-induced oxidative stress responses, highlighting a crucial role of MMP12 in this model. CONCLUSION: These findings revealed in vivo evidence supporting a crucial role for iron metabolism in nicotine salt iron-rich ENDS aerosol toxicity.",

Specifically, the study aimed to determine the diffusion coefficient of AST (D) and the dissolution rate (k'a) of the drug, as well as to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity against KKU-055 and KKU-213. The in vitro drug release profiles of AST-loaded SPIONLA/BSA demonstrated their potential for a targeted and pH-sensitive delivery mechanism. The AST release profile at different concentrations (10, 15, 20, and 25 ppm) was best fitted by the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. The release exponents (n ≤ 0.45) indicated that the drug release mechanism was controlled by quasi-Fickian diffusion. The control of drug release dynamics of AST predicted using a combination of the Noyes-Whitney and Fick's second law, was best described by a second-order release-rate diffusion control at a 10 ppm loading concentration. In contrast, a higher initial concentration (20 ppm) was best described by a first-order release-rate diffusion control model. In the cytotoxicity studies, SPIONLA/BSA demonstrated a greater decrease in cell viability compared to uncoated-SPION, in a dose-dependent manner (0-150 μg·cm-3). After 48 h of treatment, KKU-213 cells exhibited the highest cell growth inhibition, with a 54.73 % reduction in viability compared to the control group. These findings suggest that AST has potential as a potent anticancer agent for inhibiting CCA cell growth, while SPIONLA/BSA shows promise as an effective carrier for anticancer drug delivery."

Although the Weekly Iron-Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFAS) program was introduced in 2014, adherence remains a challenge. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of WhatsApp (WA) reminder messages in improving knowledge and adherence to WIFAS among adolescent girls in the Salahutu Sub-District, Maluku Province. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was employed in 2024, utilizing a pretest-posttest control group framework across two senior high schools in Salahutu Sub-District. The intervention school (n = 49) received WA-based reminder messages for four weeks, while the control school (n = 42) continued to receive routine services. We used Mann-Whitney, Fisher Exact and chi-square tests in this analysis. RESULTS: The WA-based intervention led to a significant improvement in knowledge scores among adolescent girls from the intervention school (p < 0.001). These students were also more likely to have taken WIFAS in the week preceding the endline survey (p < 0.001) and to have consumed at least 75% of the distributed WIFAS (p = 0.015) compared to the control school. Furthermore, the mean hemoglobin levels were significantly higher in the intervention compared to the control school (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The WA-based reminder messages were effective in enhancing knowledge and adherence to WIFAS. Expanding this approach to a broader population is recommended before scaling up implementation across Maluku and other regions in Indonesia."

      "abstract": "Zero-valent iron (ZVI) coupled with biostimulation is recognized as one of the most promising and effective dechlorination methods for chlorinated hydrocarbons in groundwater. However, the heterogeneity of the aquifer environment may affect the dechlorination efficiency of the coupled systems, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we systematically explored the effect and potential mechanism of sulfate (SO42-) on the removal of 1,1,2-trichloroethane (1,1,2-TCA) by the coupled ZVI and biostimulation. Results revealed that the coupled systems enhanced the degradation rate of 1,1,2-TCA by an order of magnitude compared with that of each individual treatment under SO42- stress. However, the complete dechlorination of the main product, vinyl chloride (VC), remains challenging in the absence of obligate organohalide respiration bacteria (OHRB). SO42- dynamically altered the sulfidation degree of ZVI and microbial interactions, leading to the disappearance of non-chlorinated products in the micron ZVI (mZVI) coupled system and decreased dechlorination efficiency with increasing SO42- concentration. In the nano ZVI (nZVI) coupled system, suitable SO42- concentrations promoted continuous VC degradation, likely due to the inherent high reactivity of the nanometer-size effect. Nevertheless, excessive SO42- reduced ZVI sulfidation, causing differences in dechlorination efficiency and extent trends between mZVI and nZVI coupled systems. These findings will provide scientific support for the optimal application scenarios and limitations of the coupled strategies, thereby facilitating the regulation of technology application according to actual aquifer environmental parameters to achieve low-cost environmental safety control."

While cohort studies demonstrated that specific prebiotics inhibit enteropathogens during iron supplementation, their mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the in vitro impact of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and iron-sequestering bovine lactoferrin (bLF) alone and combined on the gut microbiota of Kenyan infants during low-dose iron supplementation. Methods: Different doses of iron, GOS, and bLF were first screened during batch fermentations (n = 3), and the effect of these factors was studied on microbiota community structure and activity in the new Kenyan infant continuous intestinal PolyFermS model. The impact of different fermentation treatments on barrier integrity, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection, and inflammatory response was assessed using a transwell co-culture of epithelial and immune cells. Results: A dose-dependent increase in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/Pediococcus (LLP) growth was detected with GOS alone and combined with bLF during iron supplementation in batches. This was confirmed in the continuous PolyFermS model, which also showed a treatment-induced inhibition of opportunistic pathogens C. difficile and C. perfringens. In all tests, supplementation of iron alone and combined with bLF did not have a significant effect on microbiota composition and activity. We observed a strengthening of the epithelial barrier and a decrease in cell death and pro-inflammatory response during ETEC infection with microbiota fermentation supernatants from iron + GOS, iron + bLF, and iron + GOS + bLF treatments compared to iron alone. Conclusion: Overall, beneficial effects on infant gut microbiota were shown using advanced in vitro models for GOS alone and combined with bLF during low-dose iron supplementation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic bone metabolic disease that results from an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption. The accumulation of iron has been identified as an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. Ferroptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, is driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Nevertheless, the precise role of ferroptosis in iron accumulation-induced osteoporosis remains uncertain. METHODS: We utilized proteomics and ELISA to screen key regulatory molecules related to iron accumulation in osteoporosis populations. HE staining was used to assess osteocyte changes in Hamp knockout (KO) iron accumulation mouse models. Western Blot, qPCR, ALP staining, and Alizarin Red staining were employed to explore the effects of siRNA-mediated gene knockdown on osteogenic differentiation in the MC3T3 cell line. ELISA, micro-CT, von Kossa staining, toluidine blue staining, TRAP staining, and calcein analysis were used to study the bone phenotype of conditional gene knockout mice. RNA-seq, endoplasmic reticulum activity probes, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western Blot, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), flow cytometry, and ChIP-seq were employed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the target gene in osteogenic differentiation. OVX and Hamp KO mice were used to establish osteoporosis models, and AAV-mediated overexpression was employed to explore the intervention effects of the target gene on osteoporosis. RESULTS: The experiments demonstrate that iron accumulation can lead to changes in COPB1 expression levels in bone tissue. Cellular and animal experiments revealed that COPB1 deficiency reduces the osteogenic ability of osteoblasts. Transcriptome analysis and phenotypic experiments revealed that COPB1 deficiency induces ferroptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in cells. Further investigation confirmed that COPB1 plays a key role in endoplasmic reticulum stress by inhibits SLC7A11 transcription via ATF6. This reduces cystine uptake, ultimately inducing ferroptosis. Overexpression of COPB1 can restore osteogenic function in both cells and mice. CONCLUSION: This study elucidated the essential role of COPB1 in maintaining bone homeostasis and highlights it as a potential therapeutic target for treating iron accumulation-related osteoporosis. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: Our data elucidate the critical role of COPB1 in maintaining bone homeostasis and demonstrate that COPB1 can directly promote bone formation, making it a potential therapeutic target for the future treatment of osteoporosis."

The formation of isolated single atoms and their surrounding environment after pyrolysis at 900 °C was confirmed by XPS and EXAFS analysis. The use of FeCTAC facilitated the exposure of more single iron atoms on the porous NC matrix and prevented their aggregation, as verified by elemental analysis and HAADEF-TEM. The resulting FeSAC/NC was applied in the Fenton reaction for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). It achieved 92% TC removal in 40 min compared to only 23% with PMS alone. Free radical scavenging experiments indicated that a nonradical pathway, involving singlet oxygen and electron transfer, dominated the degradation process. Additionally, pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen sites in the NC matrix contributed significantly to TC adsorption. This exceptional catalytic performance provides valuable insights for designing highly efficient catalysts for wastewater treatment."

However, evidence suggests that some patients receive less IV iron than needed. This retrospective audit assessed the effectiveness and safety of ferric derisomaltose (FDI), a high-dose IV iron, in 2,468 patients. Efficacy outcomes assessed at 4-12 weeks post-infusion included changes in hemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin, proportion of courses (a course was defined as the treatment episode required to administer one total dose) after which patients were non-anemic (Hb ≥ 130 g/L [men] or ≥ 120 g/L [women]), and response rate (proportion of courses after which patients were non-anemic or Hb increased by ≥ 20 g/L). Safety was assessed through adverse events. Across 2,775 FDI courses, the mean dose was 1,244 mg, but mean estimated iron need was 1,580 mg. At follow-up, mean Hb had increased by 20.9 g/L and mean ferritin by 188.8 µg/L. Patients were non-anemic after 33.4% (n = 494/1,478) of courses and responded after 65.1% (n = 962/1,478) of courses. One patient (n = 1/2,468; 0.04%) had a serious allergic reaction. Patients remained anemic after > 65% of courses, demonstrating the need to optimize dosing based on iron need.",

      "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen having high infectivity among immunocompromised patients. The bacteria are resistant to major first-line antibiotics and have become a serious concern in the aspect of nosocomial and community-acquired infections. To overcome this dire situation, the necessity of introducing new approaches is undeniable, which can bypass the need for conventional antibiotic therapy. In this article, we have pinpointed the importance of iron in A. baumannii. Iron is an essential micronutrient in all bacteria. Loss of iron acquisition leads to membrane destabilization, and change in the expression of iron-transporting or -metabolizing genes causes death of the bacteria. Iron scavenging was primarily mediated by different chelators, and β-thujaplicin showed the best antibacterial efficacy with respect to time killing assay and CFU analysis. When iron (Fe2+) was supplemented after initial deficiency, the growth of the bacteria was seen to be restored. Iron deprivation also disintegrates the biofilm matrix, a major cause of bacterial resistance against different types of antibiotics. Moreover, iron scavenging promotes inhibition of biofilm sessile persister cells, the root cause of recalcitrant and chronic infection. As a part of antimicrobial therapy, β-thujaplicin was treated alongside colistin and chloramphenicol at an amount significantly lower than its MIC value. Our results indicated that β-thujaplicin nicely complemented those antibiotics to potentiate their antimicrobial action. In a nutshell, iron chelating agents are potential alternative therapeutics that can be used alongside different antibiotics to circumvent the resistance of different nosocomial pathogens."

      "abstract": "AIM: In this paper, we aim to explain the reason why iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), how to better apply diagnostic tools to uncover the state of ID as well as how to interpret the results, and not least, how to treat ID in this group of patients. METHODS: This article is an expert review and opinion paper on a topic that is too often forgotten in clinical practice. We have not performed a systematic review, but we present the most important research allocated to the topic to substantiate an expert opinion. RESULTS: This position paper summarises the pathophysiology of ID and gives recommendations on the monitoring and treatment of ID in IBD. ID with or without concurrent anaemia (IDA) is the most common systemic complication in patients with IBD, related to both disease activity and severity. It has consequences both for health-related quality of life and future course of disease of the IBD patient. Intravenous iron is an efficacious and well tolerated, but still underused, therapy for ID and IDA. Iron deficiency should be treated before symptoms of anaemia appear and quality of life is impacted. However, there is still limited awareness of how to detect and treat ID in clinical practice. Uncertainty regarding which diagnostic tests to use and how to interpret the results may also be responsible for variations in clinical practice. In addition, opinions on how to correct ID and IDA differ, in relation to both clinical efficacy and safety. CONCLUSION: The consequences of ID in patients with IBD are significant. Guidelines on diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of ID should be implemented. IDA is a manifestation of severe ID and preventive strategies focusing on efficient treatment of ID regardless of the level of haemoglobin should therefore be explored.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with chronic and recurrent characteristics caused by multiple reasons, including iron overload, intestinal inflammation, and barrier dysfunction. Here, we investigated the effects of chemical inhibition of NOXs and NLRP3 activity on colonic iron metabolism and inflammatory reactions in a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The mice were randomly divided into five groups: normal control group, DSS-induced ulcerative colitis model group (DSS), DSS + Dapansutrile group, DSS + Diphenyleneiodonium chloride group, and DSS + Dapansutrile + Diphenyleneiodonium chloride group. On day 14, the mice were euthanized. Tissues were collected and analyzed to determine the effects of chemical inhibition of NOXs and NLRP3 activity on colonic iron metabolism and inflammatory reactions of dextran sodium sulfate-induced ulcerative colitis. Measurements such as weight, disease activity index, HE staining, Prussian blue staining, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence, ELISA, flow cytometry detection, Western blot, and Quantitative Real-Time PCR were conducted. RESULTS: Chemical inhibition of NOXs and NLRP3 in vivo could significantly reduce colonic iron overload and macrophage infiltration, thus alleviating colonic inflammatory response and tissue damage. Notably, the inhibition of NOXs significantly inhibited the expression of NLRP3 and oxidative damage, but the inhibition of NLRP3 had no significant effect on the expression of NOXs and oxidative damage, suggesting NOXs may exert their effects other than oxidative damage through NLRP3. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this work is the first to reveal that NLRP3 mediates NOXs-induced colonic iron overload and inflammation rather than oxidative damage in ulcerative colitis murine model, suggesting that the NOXs might promote ulcerative colitis by inducing colonic iron overload and macrophage infiltration dependent or partially dependent on NLRP3, as well as oxidative damage independent of NLRP3, which imply that both NOXs and NLRP3 are attractive targets for anti-colitis therapy."

      "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection affects around half of the global population and is a globally highly prevalent pathogen that is closely linked not only to gastrointestinal diseases such as chronic atrophic gastritis, functional dyspepsia and peptic ulcer but also to the development and progression of a variety of extra-gastrointestinal diseases. Numerous studies have shown the correlation between H. pylori infection and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). The prevalence of H. pylori infection is higher in individuals with IDA, and the hemoglobin level of patients with IDA can be increased to different degrees or even returned to normal following active H. pylori eradication. However, this conclusion is still controversial. In this paper, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE/Web of Science database, combining the following terms: \"Helicobacter pylori,\" \"Helicobacter pylori infection,\" \"iron deficiency anemia,\" \"iron deficiency,\" \"iron absorption,\" \"iron malabsorption,\" \"serum iron,\" \"hemoglobin,\" \"pathogenesis,\" \"mechanism,\" and \"eradication therapy.\" Through extensive literature searches, the correlation between H. pylori infection and IDA, its potential mechanism, and the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy in IDA patients have been comprehensively discussed. We conclude that the majority of existing studies have confirmed the correlation between H. pylori infection and IDA, indicating that patients with H. pylori infection are more likely to develop IDA and that the prevalence of H. pylori infection is higher in individuals with IDA. Compared with iron supplementation alone, combining H. pylori eradication with iron supplementation is more effective in treating IDA, particularly in unexplained or refractory IDA cases. These findings provide valuable insights for clinicians managing patients with unexplained or refractory IDA."

      "abstract": "Excess iron has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. Flavonoids are antioxidants and cardioprotectants. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to evaluate the anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and iron-chelating qualities of two flavonoids, rutin (R) and hesperidin (H), as well as their potential to prevent induced ferroptosis in rats. It is an in vivo cross-sectional study, in which rats were divided into 12 groups; control, H, R, H + R, Fe, Fe + IR, Fe + IR + Ref, Fe + H, Fe + IR + H, Fe + R, Fe + IR + R and Fe + IR + H + R. Cardiac and serum iron levels, serum troponin I, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin, ferritin, and hepicidin were determined. Moreover, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), were also determined. The expression levels of DMT1, ACSL4, GPX4, Nrf2, and caspase-3 genes were evaluated by RT-qPCR. Lastly, a histological analysis of the heart tissues from several groups of rats was conducted. After hesperidin and/or rutin treatment, our results revealed that cardiac markers (serum troponin I and CK-MB), iron metabolism markers (serum and cardiac iron, TIBC, ferritin, transferrin, hepicidin and DMT1 expression levels) and oxidative stress markers (MDA, NO and ACSL4 expression levels) were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) reduced, while the antioxidant markers (GSH level, GPx and SOD activities and GPX4 and Nrf2 expression levels) were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) increased. Also, hesperidin and rutin exerted its protective anti-apoptotic role by significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) decreasing caspase-3 expression levels. Hesperidin and/or rutin treatment can be proposed as a therapeutic candidate to attenuate ferroptosis.",

This study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper on PC12 cells and its mechanisms, and to evaluate the therapeutic effects of sodium para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS-Na). We employed various experimental techniques, including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assays), flow cytometry, and western blotting, to systematically analyze cell viability, redox homeostasis, copper ions concentration, and the expression of cuproptosis-related proteins. The results showed that mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper significantly reduced the viability of PC12 cells, and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and copper ions concentration. At the same time, Glutathione (GSH) levels significantly decreased, indicating that the cells were affected by oxidative stress. Further analysis revealed that the increased copper ions concentration was closely related to the upregulation of CTR1 protein expression and the downregulation of ATP7 A protein expression, suggesting a link between copper ions accumulation and the ensuing cell death. Notably, PAS-Na treatment significantly restored cell viability and reversed the increase in copper ions concentration and oxidative stress caused by mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper. PAS-Na also reversed the expression of cuproptosis-related proteins, indicating its potential for neuroprotection. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of trace metal-induced cell damage and lay the groundwork for the future development of related drugs and therapeutic strategies, warranting further exploration of PAS-Na's clinical efficacy."

      "abstract": "Canine osteosarcomas (COS) are the most common bone tumors in dogs, characterized by high metastatic rates, poor prognosis, and poor responsiveness to routine therapies, which highlights the need for new treatment targets. In this context, the metabolism of neoplastic cells represents an increasingly studied element, as cancer cells depend on particular metabolic pathways that are also elements of vulnerability. Among these, tumor cells (TCs) show higher iron requirements to sustain proliferation (so-called iron addiction), which are achieved by increasing iron uptake and/or by activating ferritinophagy, a process mediated by the Nuclear receptor Co-Activator 4 (NCOA4) leading to iron mobilization from ferritin (Ft) deposits. Previous studies have shown that COS cells overexpress Transferrin Receptor 1 (TfR1) to increase iron uptake. In this study we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of ferritinophagy-related proteins, namely Ferritin Heavy chain (FTH1) and NCOA4, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in canine normal bone and canine osteoblastic osteosarcoma (COOS) samples. Normal samples revealed negative/weak immunoreactivity for FTH1, NCOA4 and PCNA in <10% of osteocytes. In COOS samples the majority of neoplastic cells showed immunoreactivity to FTH1, NCOA4 and PCNA. Our data suggest that the activation of ferritinophagy by COOS cells responds to the need for feed their \"iron addiction.\" These data, though preliminary, further suggest that targeting iron metabolism represents a new potential strategy worthy of further study to be transferred into clinical practice."

In this study, through applied MW irradiation, monodisperse, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals (IONCs) with thin, amorphous silica coatings are demonstrated to rapidly catalyze the degradation of organic compounds in water through a thermally enhanced, Fenton-type process. For this, we precisely synthesize amorphous silica-coated various metal oxide (single domain) nanocrystals, and then evaluate the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and benzoic acid (BA), chosen as model organic molecules. We examine (and optimize) the effects of core (nanocrystal) composition, size, and concentration, along with solution pH and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration. Further, we describe the catalytic degradation of BA with IONCs under MW irradiation through radical scavenger controls and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, which support the proposed reaction mechanism. For materials evaluated, the amorphous silica coating not only prevents the loss of nanocrystal integrity but also provides a reactive, yet stable, interface between nanocrystals and bulk solutions, where the degradation of organic compounds can occur. Synthesized IONCs show high performance, which is repeatable for over five cycles without any deterioration of the nanocrystals core or metal leaching. Taken together, this research highlights the potential of enhanced MW-enhanced oxidation processes appropriately coated (i.e., designed) MW absorbers (here as superparamagnetic IONCs) for advanced water treatment."

This systematic review investigates the impact of preoperative iron supplementation on the risk of blood transfusion among non-anemic patients undergoing major surgeries. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials published up to May 2024. Studies involving the use of erythropoietin, or patients already using iron supplementation when trial randomization was conducted were excluded. Outcomes assessed included the number of individuals who received blood transfusions, and mean hemoglobin levels at the first day and by the first postoperative week. RESULTS: A total of 1,162 non-anemic patients from 9 studies were included. Of these, 54% received preoperative iron supplementation. The average age was 71 years, and 44% were women. Preoperative iron supplementation was associated with a significantly lower risk of receiving a blood transfusion (OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.75; p < 0.001). At the first postoperative day, the iron supplementation group had significantly higher mean hemoglobin levels compared to the no-treatment group (MD = 0.22 g.dL-1; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.42; p = 0.03). However, the pooled results could not rule out the null hypothesis for the difference in mean hemoglobin levels throughout the first week (MD = 0.12 g.dL-1; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.35; p = 0.34). CONCLUSION: Preoperative intravenous iron supplementation in non-anemic patients undergoing major surgeries, particularly cardiac procedures, significantly reduces transfusion requirements. However, the benefits of oral iron remain uncertain, and further research is warranted to establish standardized perioperative supplementation protocols. PROSPERO IDENTIFIER: CRD42024552559."

Its main chemical components are SiO2, Fe2O3, and MgO. This study explores the impact of nickel-iron slag on the properties of magnesium sodium phosphate cement (MNPC), with the objective of addressing the environmental pollution caused by nickel-iron slag and reducing the cost of MNPC. Through experimentation, it has been found that as the content of nickel-iron slag increases, the volume deformation of MNPC is improved. When 30 % nickel-iron slag is added, the water resistance of the cement paste is significantly enhanced, and the porosity after 28 days of air curing is the lowest. Moreover, the compressive strength of all experimental groups gradually increases with the extension of water curing time. Specifically, MNPC with 30 % nickel-iron slag exhibits the highest compressive strength, the lowest strength loss rate, and the smallest porosity at 1 day, 3 days, and 28 days under both air and water curing conditions. The hydration products of MNPC are amorphous MgNaPO4・7H2O, while distinct crystalline peaks of MgNaPO4・7H2O are observed in MNPC containing nickel-iron slag, and the intensity of these peaks gradually increases with the curing time. The compressive strength of water - cured MNPC progressively increases with the curing duration, without any strength decline, and the intensity of the crystalline peaks of the hydration products also continues to strengthen. The innovation of this study lies in the effective utilization of nickel-iron slag in MNPC, which not only enhances the performance of MNPC but also provides a novel solution for the treatment of industrial waste and the development of sustainable materials."

The primary reactive species involved with BPA degradation were iron(IV) (Fe(IV)), sulfate radical (SO4•-), hydroxyl radical (•OH), and reactive chlorine species (Cl•, ClO•, Cl2•-). The steady-state concentrations of these reactive species were evaluated to determine their relationships to the Cl- and PMS contents. Fe(IV) was confirmed as the dominant reactive species, with Fe(IV) concentrations increasing with Cl- content and salinity to enhance the overall BPA degradation. Importantly, BPA degradation by the Fe/BC/PMS/Cl- system was not greatly affected by background anions or natural organic matter (NOM) present in real water sources, and the system was successfully applied for five sequential cycles of BPA treatment."

      "abstract": "The complexity of goafs put forward higher requirements for detection methods. A comprehensive detection method for old goaf is proposed, that is, determining the plane distribution range of old goaf by using high-precision magnetic method, determining the horizon of old goaf by using natural source surface wave method and controlled source audio magneto telluric method, and modifying the geophysical exploration results by using engineering drilling. Taking the old goaf of Dunqiu iron mine of China as an engineering background, the comprehensive detection method is successfully applied. The plane areas of goaf formed by mining of No. 1-3 orebody groups are 8640.6 m2, 4992.5 m2 and 6740.4 m2 respectively. The goaf can be divided into pure goaf and backfill goaf, which is 1-7 layers, 30.2-115.0 m buried depth, and 1.6-271.3 m mining thickness. A 3D geological model is constructed for displaying the situation of goaf visually. The goaf volumes of No. 1-3 orebody groups are 159,187.13 m3, 125,604.57 m3 and 174,435.28 m3 respectively. The stability of old goaf is evaluated by using two methods: influence depth of critical load and depth-thickness ratio of goaf, which is poor and has a risk of collapse. The detection method and results have certain guiding significance for the detection and treatment of old goaf in iron mine."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common malignant tumor with the greatest mortality rate among gynecological tumors. Tiliroside (TIL) is a glycosidic dietary flavonoid with various pharmacological activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the exact mechanism by which TIL eliminates OC cells. METHODS/KEY FINDINGS: In vitro, TIL exerted anti-tumor activities by inducing cell death and inhibiting the invasion and migration of A2780 and OVCAR8 cells. Additionally, the suppressive effect of TIL on OC cells was mainly due to the induction of ferroptosis, as demonstrated by the fact that only ferroprostatin-1 (Fer-1) significantly inhibited the anti-tumor activity of TIL, with the accumulation of ROS, MDA, and Fe2+ and a reduction in GPX4 expression. SwissTargetPrediction, molecular docking and CETSA assay showed that the direct interaction between AKR1B1 and TIL decreased its stability and expression. Notably, AKR1B1 overexpression significantly attenuated the effects of TIL on the proliferation, invasion, migration and ferroptosis on OC cells, whereas the levels of Fe2+ remained unaffected. Interestingly, the results of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis suggested that the regulation of iron homeostasis by TIL might be connected to ion transport. Western blotting and immunofluorescence confirmed that TIL could modulate iron metabolism by regulating iron ion transport and ferritinophagy, ultimately resulting in ferroptosis. In xenograft model mice, TIL treatment inhibited tumor growth without causing substantial tissue damage. SIGNIFICANCE: Our research revealed that TIL simultaneously targets AKR1B1 and modulates iron metabolism, thereby inducing ferroptosis and improving anti-tumor efficacy. As a novel drug, TIL is promising for OC treatment.",

The potential of these reactive materials was investigated through batch, column, and modeling tests. The materials were produced by disc milling of ZVI, sulfur (S), copper (Cu), and nickel (Ni) with molar ratios of 0.05 and 0.2. The reactivity of the materials was assessed through vapor degradation batch tests conducted under partially saturated conditions using trichloroethylene (TCE) as a model compound. Sulfidated materials with a 0.05 S/ZVI molar ratio were the most reactive, achieving up to 99 % degradation of TCE vapors within 18 h and first-order degradation constants of 5-5.7 d-1. Compared to the non-sulfidated materials, sulfidated ones remained reactive even after aging by exposure to air for 30 days. In all tests, C3-C6 hydrocarbons were detected as main byproducts, indicating β-elimination as the dominant TCE degradation pathway, with minor dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride amounts from the hydrogenolysis pathway. To evaluate the use of sulfidated bimetals as Horizontal Permeable Reactive Barriers (HPRBs) for treating chlorinated vapors in the subsurface, TCE diffusion column tests were performed using a 5 cm thick reactive layer of S-ZVI-Ni. These tests demonstrated up to 70 % degradation over 25 days. By integrating the column test results into an analytical model, it was estimated that an 18 cm HPRB could ensure up to 99 % degradation of TCE vapors. These findings highlight the potential of S-ZVI bimetals as an effective passive mitigation system for reducing chlorinated solvent vapor emissions from the subsurface."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies of thalamic iron levels in multiple sclerosis (MS) have yielded variable findings, potentially due to differences in study cohorts. For example, studies in relatively young cohorts (average ages below 40 years) have reported elevated susceptibility in people with MS (pwMS), whereas studies in older cohorts (above 40 years) found decreased susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To test the \"early-rise late-decline\" hypothesis, which posits that age differences in study cohorts are responsible for conflicting findings regarding thalamic susceptibility in MS. METHODS: We chose to replicate one of the previous studies that showed evidence of elevated thalamic iron concentrations in younger pwMS (Rudko et al., 2014). We also replicated a study involving older pwMS (Pudlac et al., 2020) to serve as a control. We assessed thalamic susceptibility using the QSM processing and analysis methodology outlined by Rudko et al. RESULTS: Although cohort characteristics, QSM processing, and analytical methods were closely matched, we found significantly lower thalamic susceptibility in the younger pwMS compared to controls (-1.1 ± 7.8 vs. 5.4 ± 6.1 ppb; effect sizes: -0.35 to -0.91). Study outcomes were robust across a wide range of regularization parameters, with effect size differences influenced by background field removal regularization. A similar pattern was observed in the older cohort, where thalamic susceptibility was again lower in pwMS compared to controls (4.0 ± 9.5 vs. 9.6 ± 10.7 ppb; effect size: -0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contradict the \"early rise\" hypothesis of thalamic iron levels in pwMS. The consistency of our results across multiple analyses suggests that QSM processing artifacts are unlikely to explain previous reports of increased thalamic iron. Instead, these variations may stem from demographic or clinical differences, such as geographical factors and treatment regimens."

The typical presentation is juvenile in onset with gradually progressive spasticity and ataxia. Only palliative treatment is available for LBSL individuals. Here we showed that the use of the Food and Drug Administration-approved heme precursors, aminolevulinate plus ferrous iron (ALA/Fe), can result in a novel pharmacological treatment that increases energy status in DARS2 deficient cells. The marked mitochondrial and antioxidant deficiencies observed in fibroblasts from two LBSL-affected brothers, harboring intron-2 (c.228-17C > G) and intron-5 (c.492 + 2 T > C) DARS2 mutations, were rescued by ALA/Fe exposure, and the use of dexamethasone, a known Nrf-2 inhibitor, blocked the positive effects of ALA/Fe. Altogether, this study showed that fibroblasts can be used as a biological system to identify potential new treatments for LBSL that can reduce morbidity and mortality, and that the activation of Nrf-2-mediated cytoprotection can be targeted for the treatment of LBSL and other mitochondrial diseases.",

      "abstract": "Long-term anaerobic conditions in septic tanks exacerbate the release of hazardous gases, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which degrades urban air quality. While traditional iron salt addition effectively inhibits H2S production, its large-scale application imposes economic burdens and challenges for low-carbon emission reduction. To address this issue, this study proposes the use of scrap iron filings (SIFs) as a source of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions and evaluates their efficacy in sulfide control through a long-term laboratory-scale septic tank reactor. Experimental results demonstrated that the addition of SIFs reduced the average concentration of dissolved sulfides by 45.6 % and gaseous H2S by 92.6 %. Microbial community analysis of septic tank sediments revealed a significant decrease in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and an increase in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), indicating that SIFs influence microbial activity by suppressing sulfide generation while enhancing sulfide oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of SIFs slightly increased the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) and carbon-to-phosphorus (C/P) ratios in the effluent, potentially improving subsequent nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment. These findings suggest a promising strategy for reducing hydrogen sulfide emissions and corrosion in septic tanks."
