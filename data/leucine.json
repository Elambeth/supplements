      "abstract": "N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL), a derivative of the branched-chain amino acid leucine, has shown therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases, including in prodromal stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanism of its protective effects has been largely unknown. Using discovery-based proteomics, we found that treatment with NALL led to upregulation of lysosomal, mitochondrial, and synaptic proteins in PD patient-derived dopaminergic neurons. NALL reduced levels of pathological pS129-alpha-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons from patients harboring GBA1 or LRRK2 mutations. This decrease in pS129-syn was dependent on serine protease HTRA1 that was induced by NALL treatment of dopaminergic neurons. NALL also upregulated expression of wild-type parkin in both GBA1 and LRRK2 mutant neurons, leading to an increase in functional dopamine transporter and synaptic membrane-associated synaptojanin-1, suggesting improved synaptic function. Furthermore, NALL treatment of mutant LRRK2R1441C knock-in mice led to decreased pS129-alpha-synuclein, increased parkin and improved dopamine-dependent motor learning deficits. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of NALL in PD by its protective effects on α-synuclein pathology and synaptic function in vulnerable dopaminergic neurons."

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia, characterized by the degeneration of skeletal muscle tissue, has emerged as a significant concern in recent years. This increased awareness stems from advances in research focusing on elderly patients, which have revealed correlations between aging mechanisms and muscle degeneration, beyond the mere fact that tissues age and deteriorate over time. Consequently, the present study aims to address sarcopenia by developing and evaluating DPPC lipid vesicles that encapsulate three distinct drugs: HMB, NMN, and L-Leucine. These drugs are specifically selected for their properties, which facilitate effective interaction with the affected muscle tissue, thereby promoting desired therapeutic effects. Preliminary physicochemical analyses indicate the successful formation of spherical lipid vesicles, characterized by nanometric dimensions and stable membrane integrity. The biological investigations aimed to highlight the potential of DPPC lipid vesicles encapsulating HMB, NMN, and L-Leucine to alleviate sarcopenia-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Through a comparative evaluation of the three drug formulations, we demonstrate that drug-loaded DPPC vesicles effectively mitigate oxidative damage, preserve mitochondrial function, and maintain cytoskeletal integrity in H2O2-induced C2C12 myotubes, with HMB-loaded vesicles showing the strongest protective effects against muscle degeneration. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of DPPC-based controlled release systems for sarcopenia treatment and highlight the need for further investigations into their mechanistic role in muscle preservation.",

      "abstract": "Leucine rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) is recognized for its intimate association with the extracellular matrix, where it modulates fibroblast function and shapes the immune landscape within the tumour microenvironment. The specific expression patterns and molecular contributions of LRRC15 in triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to delineate the clinical relevance and biological implications of LRRC15 in TNBC, and to assess its potential as a novel therapeutic target for this disease. Our findings revealed robust overexpression of LRRC15 in TNBC tumour tissues and cell lines, which was inversely correlated with patient survival outcomes. Notably, the suppression of LRRC15 expression led to pronounced inhibition of TNBC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we established that LRRC15 interacts with Integrin Beta 1(ITGB1), facilitating the phosphorylation of the T788/T789 residues on ITGB1 and recruiting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to the site of integrin aggregation. This recruitment promotes the downstream phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, suggesting that LRRC15 is a key activator of the ITGB1/FAK/PI3K signalling pathway. Collectively, our data indicate that LRRC15 is a critical promoter of TNBC cell proliferation and metastasis through the activation of this signalling pathway, identifying LRRC15 as a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention in TNBC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous data indicated that the leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) pathway contributes to vascular dysfunction during cancer growth. Therapeutic targeting of LRG1 normalized tumor vessel dysfunction and enhanced the efficacy of anti-cancer adoptive T cell therapy. A major clinical problem after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) and after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is the induction of hyperinflammatory side effects, which are typically associated with severe endothelial dysfunction. METHODS: We investigated LRG1 in preclinical models and in patient samples. RESULTS: In prospective studies, we found elevated LRG1 serum levels in patients with cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome after CAR-T-cell therapy as well as in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after alloHSCT.In preclinical models of aGVHD, we found vasculature-associated LRG1 upregulation as well as LRG1 pathway gene upregulation. The genetic deletion of LRG1 in alloHSCT donors and in alloHSCT recipients led to reduced clinical and histological aGVHD. In line with this, LRG1 deletion led to clinically and histologically reduced disease severity in experimental inflammatory models of colitis (dextran sulfate sodium colitis) and paw edema. LRG1 deletion reduced inflammation-related vascular leakiness, endothelial cell proliferation, and migration. CONCLUSIONS: The current data support the hypothesis that LRG1 is an attractive therapeutic target after alloHSCT and after CAR-T cell therapy for cancer because of its role in dysfunctional tumor vessels as well as in inflammatory complications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Leucine Zipper 4 (LUZP4)-immunoglobulin G (IgG) is a novel antibody implicated in germ cell tumor-related paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome. We report a case of painful, progressive tetraparesis associated with testicular seminoma and LUZP4-IgG seropositivity. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old male presented with a 5-week history of lower limb predominant progressive weakness. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) revealed a subacute axonal polyradiculoneuropathy. MRI lumbar spine showed thickening of the cauda equina and enhancement of the lower thoracic spinal cord/conus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis, three oligoclonal bands, and mildly elevated protein. Initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and prednisone produced temporary improvement. CT targeted retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy revealed a seminoma, which was treated with orchiectomy and chemotherapy. The testicular tissue was consistent with a regressed germ cell tumor. His course was subsequently refractory to IVIG, prednisone, and plasma exchange. LUZP4 antibodies were detected in serum, prompting treatment with cyclophosphamide and prednisone. At the 4-month follow-up, the patient had significant improvement in hand strength and had transitioned from walker to cane. INTERPRETATION: LUZP4-IgG seropositivity and identification of retroperitoneal seminoma confirmed a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome, which is a CD8+ T-cell-mediated disorder. Aggressive immunotherapy was initiated, resulting in clinical improvement. This case underscores the importance of identifying specific serologic biomarkers that can inform therapeutic decisions and improve outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Neonatal bacterial meningitis is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. Neonatal meningitis-causing Escherichia coli (NMEC) is the most common gram-negative bacteria responsible for this disease. However, the interactions of NMEC with its environment within the host are poorly understood. Here, we showed that a low level of leucine, a niche-specific signal in the blood, promotes NMEC pathogenicity by enhancing bacterial survival and replication in the blood. A low leucine level downregulates the expression of NsrP, a small RNA (sRNA) identified in this study, in NMEC in an Lrp-dependent manner. NsrP destabilizes the mRNA of the purine biosynthesis-related gene purD by direct base pairing. Decreased NsrP expression in response to low leucine levels in the blood, which is a purine-limiting environment, activates the bacterial de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, thereby enhancing bacterial pathogenicity in the host. Deletion of NsrP or purD significantly increases or decreases the development of E. coli bacteremia and meningitis in animal models, respectively. Furthermore, we showed that intravenous administration of leucine effectively reduces the development of bacteremia and meningitis caused by NMEC by blocking the Lrp-NsrP-PurD signal transduction pathway. This study provides a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of E. coli-induced meningitis.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SCFAs on human skeletal muscle energy metabolism. METHODS: Primary human myotubes were analysed for glucose and fatty acid (oleic acid) metabolism, as well as insulin sensitivity and protein synthesis in the presence or absence of SCFAs. RESULTS: The most pronounced effects of SCFAs were observed on 14C-oleic acid uptake and oxidation, as well as 14C-leucine uptake and protein synthesis, following butyrate treatment. Butyrate increased 14C-leucine accumulation twofold, potentially due to protein incorporation. On the other hand, the conversion of 14C-leucine into free fatty acids was reduced by more than 50% by butyrate. Both 14C-acetate and 14C-butyrate were shown to be taken up and utilised by primary human myotubes. None of the SCFAs were found to influence glucose metabolism or insulin effects. CONCLUSION: The results from the current study thus suggest that among the SCFAs, butyrate emerges as the most powerful SCFA in regulating primary human myotube metabolism.",

The development of LRRK2 inhibitors has attracted much interest, and various compounds have been reported with significant improvement in preclinical and clinical models. Currently, no LRRK2 inhibitor has been approved for PD intervention. Herein, we reported a virtual screening (VS) workflow combining molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to achieve eight compounds for further enzymatic assay. The results indicated a potent LRRK2 inhibitor 2 with IC50 values of 2.396 and 5.996 μM against LRRK2 and LRRK2 G2019S, respectively, implying the reliability of this VS approach. Combined with predicted favorable drug-like properties, this hit can be used as a starting point for further structural optimization, probably offering insight into targeting LRRK2 for PD treatment in the future.",

      "abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) cells offer a promising strategy for cancer treatment. These CAR-T cells are either autologous or allogeneic T cells that are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor targeting a specific tumor antigen. Ongoing research aims to optimize the CAR-T cell efficacy, including strategies to modulate their metabolism. One such approach involves inducing transgene expression by activating the GCN2 kinase signaling pathway through dietary deprivation of an essential amino acid. In this study, we investigated the general impact of a 6-hour leucine deprivation on primary activated human T cells using RNA-seq technology. Our analysis identified 3,431 differentially expressed genes between T cells cultured in regular medium and those cultured in leucine-deprived medium. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that \"TNFα signaling via NFκB\", \"interferon-γ response\", and \"unfolded protein response\" gene sets were positively enriched, while \"mTORC1 signaling\", \"Myc targets\", and \"oxidative phosphorylation\" gene sets were negatively enriched. To further evaluate the involvement of GCN2 kinase in regulating the differential gene expression during the 6-hour leucine deprivation, T cells were cultured with or without a GCN2 inhibitor. We found that 59% of the differentially expressed genes in our dataset were dependent on the kinase GCN2 (n = 2028), with 1,140 up-regulated and 888 down-regulated genes. These findings suggest a promising strategy to enhance CAR-T cell efficacy by combining short amino acid starvation with transient overexpression of a target gene.",

Activation and mutation of NLRP3 can cause severe inflammation in diseases such as chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome, and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 1. To date, a great effort has been made to decode the underlying mechanisms of NLRP3 activation. The priming and activation of NLRP3 drive the maturation and release of active interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1β to cause inflammation and pyroptosis, which can significantly trigger many diseases including inflammatory diseases, immune disorders, metabolic diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. The investigation of NLRP3 as a therapeutic target for disease treatment is a hot topic in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. Developing potent NLRP3 inhibitors and downstream IL-1 inhibitors attracts wide-spectrum attention in both research and pharmaceutical fields. In this minireview, we first updated the molecular mechanisms involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the associated downstream signaling pathways. We then reviewed the molecular and cellular pathways of NLRP3 in many diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. In addition, we briefly reviewed the roles of NLRP3 in cancer growth and relative immune checkpoint therapy. Finally, clinical trials with treatments targeting NLRP3 and its downstream signaling pathways were summarized."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein (LRG) has been identified as a disease activity marker that reflects pathology of inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Whereas LRG was reported to modulate transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β) signaling, the role of LRG in inflammatory diseases has not been fully clarified. Here we investigated the role of LRG in IBD. METHODS: First, we investigated the difference of pathologies between wild-type (WT) mice and LRG-deficient (LRG-/-) mice in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced experimental colitis. Next, we analyzed the role of LRG in colonic inflammation by using in vitro assay. RESULTS: Prompt LRG upregulation was detected on the colonic epithelial cells on day 1 post 3% DSS treatment. Body weight loss after DSS treatment was significantly less severe in LRG-/- mice than in WT mice. Histological examination disclosed that leukocyte infiltration in colonic tissue was attenuated in LRG-/- mice compared with WT mice on day 3. Interestingly, the expression of endoglin, one of adhesion molecules in vascular endothelial cells, was markedly elevated in WT mice on day 1 post-DSS treatment, but was not in LRG-/- mice. Anti-TGF-β antibody treatment in mice with DSS colitis revealed that TGF-β is critical for endoglin upregulation in endothelial cells. Importantly, recombinant LRG when added to the culture media enhanced TGF-β1-induced endoglin expression in endothelial cells and increased adherence of monocytes to endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that LRG accelerates the progression of colonic inflammation at least in part by enhancing leukocyte trafficking through the upregulation of TGF-β1-induced endoglin expression in vascular endothelial cells."

Anabolic resistance, which refers to the diminished response of skeletal muscle to anabolic stimulation from leucine and other nutrients, is a significant contributing factor to its development. Recent studies have suggested that large neutral amino acid-transporter 1 (LAT1/SLC7A5) may play an important role in enhancing leucine's effects on protein synthesis in aging skeletal muscle. In this paper, the structure and function of LAT1 and its key molecules regulating aging skeletal muscle protein synthesis were reviewed, and the potential relationship between LAT1, as a transmembrane transporter of leucine, and protein synthesis in aging skeletal muscle was analyzed. The aim is to explore new mechanisms and insights for prevention and treatment of age-related sarcopenia, and provide reference for the application of relevant targets in clinical translational medicine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Dietary protein intake can potentially influence renal function. This study aimed to elucidate the association between dietary protein supplementation and a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in Japanese stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation. METHODS: From July 2017 to June 2021, 60 patients undergoing post-stroke rehabilitation were randomly assigned to a rehabilitation alone or rehabilitation nutrition group, which received 120 g Reha-Time Jelly® after each session. Both groups were followed up for 3 months. Serum nutritional markers (prealbumin and retinol-binding protein), muscle strength, body composition, renal function markers (eGFR based on creatinine [eGFR-Cr] and cystatin C [eGFR-Cys]), urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR), and motor function (walking speed, 2-min walk distance, and chair stand test) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Of the 60 participants (mean age: 70.2 ± 10.0 years), 39 were men (65.0%) and 19 (31.7%) had chronic kidney disease. Initial eGFR-Cr and eGFR-Cys values were 70.5 ± 17.2 and 66.6 ± 14.8 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. After the intervention, the rehabilitation nutrition group demonstrated a significantly greater increase in body mass index (BMI) and a smaller decrease in bone mineral content than the rehabilitation alone group. However, no significant between-group differences were noted in serum marker levels or motor function, including grip strength and knee extensor strength, on the paralyzed and non-paralyzed sides. The change in chair stand test performance indicated a trend toward improvement in the rehabilitation nutrition group. No significant differences were observed in the changes in renal function. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-month nutritional supplementation intervention may help increase BMI, preserve bone mineral content, and support physical activity levels in patients undergoing post-stroke rehabilitation without negatively affecting renal function.",

Trials with N-acetyl-leucine (NAL) demonstrated efficacy in disorders featuring ataxia, cognitive impairment, and epilepsy. Accordingly, we hypothesized that NAL may be effective in CACNA1A-associated disorders. CASES: Four patients (1 boy, age 15 years, 3 girls, age 5, 9, and 14) received NAL as individualized off-label treatment and were assessed using the SARA Score, SCAFI and CGI-I. In all children NAL resulted in rapid improvement of ataxia, (gait, balance, fine motor and speech - mean SARA improvement at first follow-up: 3.25 points). Improvement was sustained up to 3 years (mean long-term SARA improvement: 5.13 points). SCAFI and CGI-I showed similar improvement. NAL was well-tolerated, without adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: N-acetyl-leucine is a novel potential treatment for a so far untreatable rare disease spectrum of CACNA1A-disorders. The sustained benefit may reflect neuroprotective effects seen in other populations. Clinical trials are needed to control the results.",

However, it remains unclear whether these factors are associated with the occurrence of cognitive impairment (CI) in PD patients. METHODS: This study initially enrolled eligible PD patients without cognitive impairment. Blood samples were collected to measure serum levels of α-synuclein, Hcy, and LRG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After one year of treatment, patients were divided into CI group and non-CI groups based on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Baseline clinical characteristics and the levels of these three factors were compared between the two groups. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the predictive value of these factors for the occurrence of CI in PD patients. RESULTS: The study included 102 eligible PD patients without baseline CI, divided into 65 patients in the non-CI group and 37 patients in the CI group after one year, based on the MoCA scores. Serum levels of α-synuclein, Hcy, and LRG in the CI group were 0.42 ± 0.33 ng/mL, 19.85 ± 6.31 µmol/L, and 14.53 ± 5.11 ng/mL respectively, compared to 0.04 ± 0.03 ng/mL, 14.32 ± 5.25 µmol/L, and 11.67 ± 3.10 ng/mL in the non-CI group. Patients in the CI group had MoCA scores below 26, indicating cognitive impairment. ROC analysis revealed that α-synuclein, Hcy, and LRG levels effectively predicted the occurrence of CI in PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of α-synuclein, Hcy and LRG were elevated in the CI group compared to the non-CI group, suggesting that these factors may serve as predictors of cognitive impairment in PD patients.",

It has been suggested that T cells expressing multiple CARs may overcome the resistance of tumours and that T cells expressing receptors that switch inhibitory immune-checkpoint signals into costimulatory signals may enhance the activity of the T cells in the tumour microenvironment. However, engineering multiple features into a single T cell product is difficult because of the transgene-packaging constraints of current gene-delivery vectors. Here we describe a cell-sorting method that leverages leucine zippers for the selective single-step immunomagnetic purification of cells co-transduced with two vectors. Such 'Zip sorting' facilitated the generation of T cells simultaneously expressing up to four CARs and coexpressing up to three 'switch' receptors. In syngeneic mouse models, T cells with multiple CARs and multiple switch receptors eliminated antigenically heterogeneous populations of leukaemia cells coexpressing multiple inhibitory ligands. By combining diverse therapeutic strategies, Zip-sorted multi-CAR multi-switch-receptor T cells can overcome multiple mechanisms of CAR T cell resistance.",

Knocking out OsPik-2-like in rice increased the LF-induced levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the activity of trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs), and the basal levels of some flavonoids, which in turn decreased the performance of LF larvae. Moreover, knocking out OsPik-2-like reduced plant growth. These findings demonstrate that OsPik-2-like regulates the symbiosis between rice and LF by balancing plant growth and defense."

Ethylene and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key players in accelerating rose petal senescence, but the molecular mechanism by which ethylene antagonizes ROS scavenging is not well understood. Here, we showed that ethylene reduces ascorbic acid (AsA) production, leading to the accumulation of ROS and hastening petal senescence. Ethylene treatment suppressed the expression of GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase 1 (RhGGP1), encoding the rate-controlling enzyme in AsA biosynthesis. A HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP) II transcription factor, RhHB22, directly bound to the promoter of RhGGP1 and inhibited its transcription. RhHB22 is induced by ethylene, and silencing of RhHB22 increased RhGGP1 expression and AsA production, resulting in reduced H2O2 accumulation and delayed petal senescence. Additionally, the delayed petal senescence symptoms of RhHB22-silenced plants were suppressed by silencing RhGGP1. Moreover, the expression of RhGGP1, which is suppressed by ethylene in wild-type petals, was significantly compromised in RhHB22-silenced petals. These findings uncover the transcriptional regulatory mechanism by which ethylene promotes ROS accumulation and petal senescence by inhibiting AsA biosynthesis, enhance our understanding of ethylene-induced petal senescence, and provide novel insights for improving the longevity of cut flowers.",

It is unclear whether the pretreatment serum LRG level can predict clinical effectiveness including serum trough levels of ustekinumab in patients with IBD. This multicenter prospective cohort study included 184 patients (Crohn's disease, 104; ulcerative colitis, 80) who received ustekinumab (n = 119) or anti-tumor necrosis factor (n = 65) between January 2019 and March 2023. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed serum LRG level at week 0 (0w-LRG, odds ratio 0.12, 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.68) as one of significant factors for clinical remission at week 8. We divided patients into the low- and the high-LRG groups by the median 0w-LRG (18.2 µg/mL) and compared the effectiveness. In patients who received ustekinumab, the proportion of clinical remission at week 8 was significantly different between in the low- (76.9%) and in the high-LRG group (59.3%, P = 0.038), and median serum trough level at week 8 was significantly different between in the low- (10.9 µg/mL, interquartile range 6.7-13.4) and the high-LRG group (5.3 µg/mL, interquartile range 2.4-8.3, P < 0.001). The 0w-LRG can predict the effectiveness including serum trough levels of ustekinumab during induction treatment for patients with IBD.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence has discovered that circular RNAs play important regulators of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the role and potential molecular mechanism of hsa_circ_100549 (circ_0004630) involved in NSCLC is poorly defined. In this study, circ_0004630, microRNA-1208 (miR-1208), and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) expression were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, and invasion were assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, colony formation, flow cytometry, and transwell assays. Protein levels of glucose transporter 1, Hexokinase 2, and LRRK2 were detected using western blot assay. Glucose consumption, lactate production, and adenosine triphosphate content were assessed using the corresponding kits. After predicting via bioinformatics software Circinteractome and Targetscan, the binding between miR-1208 and circ_0004630 or LRRK2 was verified by a dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assay. The xenograft tumor model analyzed the biological role circ_000460 on tumor growth in vivo. It was found that circ_0004630 and LRRK2 were increased, and miR-1208 was low expression in NSCLC tissues and cells. Functionally, the downregulation of circ_0004630 inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, invasion, glycolysis, and accelerated apoptosis in vitro. In mechanism, circ_0004630 might work as a sponge of miR-1208 to modulate LRRK2 expression. In addition, DUXAP8 deficiency cured neuroblastoma tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, circ_0004630 knockdown might suppress NSCLC cell proliferation, metastasis, and glycolysis partly by the miR-1208/LRRK2 axis. Our findings hinted at an important theoretical basis for further elucidating the pathogenesis of NSCLC and targeted therapy.",

      "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is a tightly controlled process frequently deregulated in cancer. Key to this deregulation are transfer RNAs (tRNAs), whose expression, processing and post-transcriptional modifications are often altered in cancer to support cellular transformation. In conditions of limiting levels of amino acids, this deregulated control of protein synthesis leads to aberrant protein production in the form of ribosomal frameshifting or misincorporation of non-cognate amino acids. Here, we studied leucine, an essential amino acid coded by six different codons. Surprisingly, we found that leucine deprivation leads to ribosomal stalling and aberrant protein production in various cancer cell types, predominantly at one codon, UUA. Similar effects were observed after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, implying a shared mechanism controlling the downstream effects on mRNA translation. In both conditions, a limitation in the availability of tRNALeu(UAA) for protein production was shown to be the cause for this dominant effect on UUA codons. The induced aberrant proteins can be processed and immune-presented as neoepitopes and can direct T-cell killing. Altogether, we uncovered a novel mode of interplay between DNA damage, regulation of tRNA availability for mRNA translation and aberrant protein production in cancer that could be exploited for anti-cancer therapy.",

Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), particularly leucine, are essential for various metabolic and physiological processes involved in heart development. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms through which elevated levels of leucine induce defects in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. We collected plasma samples from healthy controls and neonatal patients with CHDs, employed a high-leucine diet for pregnant female mice, and applied high-leucine treatment in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs). The impacts of high-leucine levels on WD Repeat Containing Planar Cell Polarity Effector (WDPCP)/MAPK signaling axis were investigated in the cell and animal models. We reported heightened plasma leucine levels in neonatal patients with CHDs and observed that a high-leucine diet in pregnant mice was associated with reduced expression of WDPCP and attenuated MAPK/ERK signaling. High-leucine treatment in HCMECs impaired epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration; however, overexpression of WDPCP or activation of MAPK exhibited a rescue effect. The upregulation of endomucin (EMCN) under high-leucine conditions contributed to the impaired EMT and migratory capacity of HCMECs, and the WDPCP/MAPK signaling axis regulated EMCN overexpression in response to high-leucine treatment. High levels of leucine in neonatal patients with CHDs may inhibit the WDPCP/MAPK axis, leading to an increase in EMCN expression that undermines the function of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. These findings suggest the potential of targeting the WDPCP/MAPK axis as an intervention strategy for neonatal CHDs."

Leucine-rich α2 glycoprotein (LRG) is expressed in the serum of patients with inflammatory diseases, and salivary LRG may be applicable to the diagnosis of periodontal disease. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of initial periodontal therapy (IPT) on clinical periodontal parameters such as probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA), periodontal epithelial surface area (PESA), saliva samples were collected before and after IPT from 63 patients with chronic periodontitis. The amount of LRG protein in saliva was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Salivary LRG levels of 30 patients with Stage III, Grade B or C periodontitis (Severe group) were higher than the LRG levels of 33 patients with Stage Ⅰ or Ⅱ, Grade A periodontitis (Mild group). LRG levels in the Severe group significantly decreased after IPT. Positive correlations were found between salivary LRG levels and mean PD, CAL, BOP rate, PISA and PESA. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there is an association between salivary LRG levels and severity of periodontitis.",

The present study investigated the oncogenic roles of lncRNAs in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and their potential as prognostic biomarkers. The lncRNA leucine‑rich repeat containing 75 A‑antisense RNA1 (LRRC75A‑AS1) was identified through lncRNA microarray as a potential lncRNA that may predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and cancer progression in RCC. The present study subsequently assessed the expression of LRRC75A‑AS1 in 212 patients with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) who underwent nephrectomy, and performed in vitro functional analysis of LRRC75A‑AS1 in RCC cell lines. Additionally, the interactions between LRRC75A‑AS1, microRNA (miR)‑370‑5p and ADAMTS5 were explored. LRRC75A‑AS1 was revealed to be significantly upregulated in ccRCC tissues compared with in adjacent normal tissues, and high LRRC75A‑AS1 expression was associated with poor prognosis, including lower progression‑free survival, in patients with RCC. The knockdown of LRRC75A‑AS1 in RCC cell lines resulted in reduced cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting its role in promoting tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the interaction among LRRC75A‑AS1, miR‑370‑5p and ADAMTS5 was suggested as a regulatory mechanism underlying RCC progression. These findings indicated that LRRC75A‑AS1 may function as an oncogene in RCC, promoting cell proliferation and invasion. Its significant upregulation in ccRCC tissues and association with poor prognosis underscore its potential as a prognostic biomarker for RCC. Understanding the regulatory interactions among LRRC75A‑AS1, miR‑370‑5p and ADAMTS5 may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying RCC and facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

This study tested the hypothesis that a leucine-rich diet could attenuate inflammation and improve gut health in a mouse model of IBD. Specifically, we investigated the effects of a leucine-rich diet on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in germ-free (GF) SAMP1/YitFC (SAMP) mice colonized with human gut microbiota (hGF-SAMP). hGF-SAMP mice were fed one of four different diets: standard mouse diet (CHOW), American diet (AD), leucine-rich AD (AD + AA), or leucine-rich CHOW diet (CH + AA). Body weight, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, gut permeability, colonoscopy scores, and histological analysis were measured. Mice on a leucine-rich CHOW diet showed a decrease in fecal MPO prior to DSS treatment as compared to those on a regular diet (p > 0.05); however, after week five, prior to DSS, this effect had diminished. Following DSS treatment, there was no significant difference in gut permeability, fecal MPO activity, or body weight changes between the leucine-supplemented and control groups. These findings suggest that while a leucine-rich diet may transiently affect fecal MPO levels in hGF-SAMP mice, it does not confer protection against DSS-induced colitis symptoms or mitigate inflammation in the long term.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Within human skeletal muscle, statin treatment leads to elevated levels of the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ). Further, GILZ mediates the muscle-related side effects of statins. Physical exercise leads to GILZ suppression, in a mechanosensitive manner. Given that statin treatment is rarely tolerated by habitually exercising individuals due to statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), it appears that the opposing regulation of GILZ facilitates this detrimental interaction of two key measures of cardiovascular prevention, specifically for exercise modalities with high muscle strain. Similarly, opposing regulation of atrophy associated genes (atrogenes) may be a further mechanism. If confirmed, these results might have implications for the exercise prescription of statin-users. METHODS: A systematic search of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository for studies reporting the acute effects of either endurance (END), conventional resistance (RT), or eccentric resistance training (ECC) was conducted. GILZ, as well as the expression of pivotal atrogenes (e.g., muscle atrophy F-box, cathepsin L, etc.) were quantified. RESULTS: 15 studies with 204 participants (22 females; 182 males) were included. RT resulted in the highest GILZ suppression, significantly differing from the expressional change after END ( - 0.46 ± 1.11 vs.  - 0.07 ± 1.08), but not from ECC ( - 0.46 ± 1.11 vs. - 0.46 ± 0.95). Similar results were seen for various atrogenes. CONCLUSION: Our results strengthen the assumption that mechanical loading can be considered a key mediator of exercise-induced changes in GILZ and atrogene expression.",

Twenty-four Angus cows of similar initial weight (575.5 ± 22.1 kg) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups with six replicate pens (two cattle per pen). The groups were fed a basal diet (CON) or a basal diet supplemented with 6.0 g/100 kg BW per day of L-Leu for 120 days pre-slaughter. Feeding L-Leu significantly increased average daily gain and decreased feed-to-weight-gain ratio (P < 0.05). L-Leu improved plasma free leucine bioavailability (P < 0.05), increased the concentrations of tyrosine and glutamine (P < 0.05), and decreased the concentrations of threonine and valine (P < 0.05). It also increased the content of total protein in plasma (P < 0.05). Supplementation with L-Leu tended to increase the marbling score (P = 0.06) and decrease subcutaneous fat thickness (P = 0.06), as well as the content of C10:0 (P < 0.05), C14:0 (P = 0.05), C20:0 (P < 0.05), and C18:2n-6 t (P = 0.07) in the longissimus thoracis muscle. However, L-Leu significantly increased the crude protein content in the longissimus thoracis muscle (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that L-Leu downregulated the relative abundance of metabolites associated with subcutaneous fat thickness and beef fatty acid synthesis (P < 0.01), and upregulated the relative abundance of metabolites associated with crude protein and ether extract in the longissimus thoracis muscle (P < 0.01).

Because LRG levels differ among patients, it is necessary to assess them after profiling patients, especially in patients with refractory UC undergoing treatment with molecular-targeted drugs. This study aimed to analyze LRG levels that indicate mucosal healing according to clinical characteristics and molecular-targeted drugs. METHODS: Among 214 patients with UC treated with biologics or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, this study evaluated 111 patients (174 measurements) who achieved mucosal healing based on colonoscopy performed within 2 months before and after LRG measurement and experienced no changes in disease status or treatment during the same period. We analyzed the relationship of LRG with clinical characteristics (including sex, age, body mass index, and disease type and duration) and molecular-targeted drugs. RESULTS: Compared with men, women had significantly higher LRG levels (9.5 μg/mL vs. 11.3 μg/mL, p < 0.001). In addition, LRG levels were significantly higher in older patients (12.0 μg/mL vs. 9.8 μg/mL, p < 0.01). LRG levels were the highest in patients treated with vedolizumab and lower in patients treated with JAK inhibitors (vedolizumab: 12.7 μg/mL; tofacitinib: 8.9 μg/mL; upadacitinib: 8.5 μg/mL; and filgotinib: 9.1 μg/mL; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Among the patients who achieved mucosal healing, LRG levels were significantly higher in women and older patients. LRG levels differed according to the molecular-targeted drug used and were higher with vedolizumab and lower with JAK inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The global aging population has led to increased noncommunicable diseases, often linked to poor diet and declining muscle strength and mass. This study assessed leucine intake and sarcopenia indicators among 181 adults aged 60-80 in Santiago, Chile, participating in the Program for Complementary Food in Older People (PACAM), with 80% being women. METHODS: Sarcopenia was evaluated through muscle strength and mass using the EWGSOP2 criteria for its identification. RESULTS: 78.45% of participants did not meet the recommended leucine intake of 3 g per day and sarcopenia was identified in 17.13% of them. The skeletal muscle index was 48.07%, and hand grip strength was 26.52%, with men showing significantly higher grip strength (48.60% vs. 28.80%, p = 0.00). Inadequate leucine intake was more common in those aged 60-75 (85.9%) than those over 75 (p = 0.03). No significant differences in BMI, grip strength, or muscle mass were found between those with adequate and inadequate leucine intake, and PACAM food consumption did not significantly affect these parameters. A sub-analysis showed significant differences in grip strength among powdered dairy drink consumers (35.20% vs. 17.80%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Chilean elderly participating in PACAM present a high prevalence of sarcopenia and leucine deficiency among with no notable benefits from PACAM foods intake. Despite the limitations of the local body composition assessment method, this research addresses a critical public health issue in Chile. Future studies should evaluate physical performance and focus on leucine supplementation to clarify its effects on sarcopenia.",

Recent research suggests that intestinal fungal dysbiosis may play a role in IBD development. This study investigates the effects of the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZp)\", known for its protective role in gut mucosa, and a yeast extract (Py) with prebiotic properties, either alone or combined, in DSS-induced colitis. Both treatments alleviated symptoms via overlapping or distinct mechanisms. In particular, they reduced the transcription levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, as well as the expression of the tight junction protein Claudin-2. Additionally, GILZp increased MUC2 transcription, while Py reduced IL-12p40 and IL-6 levels. Notably, both treatments were effective in restoring the intestinal burden of clinically important Candida and related species. Intestinal mycobiome analysis revealed that they were able to reduce colitis-associated fungal dysbiosis, and this effect was mainly the result of a decreased abundance of the Meyerozima genus, which was dominant in colitic mice. Overall, our results suggest that combined treatment regimens with GILZp and Py could represent a new strategy for the treatment of IBD by targeting multiple mechanisms, including the fungal dysbiosis.",

Although high-virulent strains are associated with increased mortality rate in severely infected patients, the underlying mechanisms remains not well understood. Our analysis revealed leucine as a pivotal biomarker, with the 11dP and paaK being significant contributors to virulence. The ATP-dependent activity and antioxidant activity were identified as the most important pathways in distinguishing the virulence of A. baumannii. Exogenous leucine was found to modulate mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress, thereby diminishing the pathogenicity of A. baumannii towards Beas 2B cells. Moreover, leucine reduced the virulence of A. baumannii to Galleria mellonella (G. mellonella) and alleviated pathological damage to lung tissues in mice. Our study offers a novel treatment strategy based on metabolomics, which may assist in the exploration and management of infections caused by highly virulent pathogens. It sets a new course for reducing the impact of highly virulent A. baumannii infections and has significant implications for the development of future therapeutic interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Therapy failure in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC, ∼80% occur in the liver) remains an overarching challenge. Preclinical studies demonstrated that human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) cell survival, but therapies blocking the neuregulin-induced canonical HER3 signaling have made little impact in the clinic. Recent studies suggest that the liver microenvironment promotes CRC growth by activating HER3 in a neuregulin-independent fashion, thus elucidation of these mechanisms may reveal new strategies for treating patients with mCRC. METHODS: Patient-derived primary liver endothelial cells (ECs) were used to interrogate EC-CRC crosstalk. We conducted proteomic analysis to identify EC-secreted factor(s) that triggers noncanonical HER3 activation in CRC and determined the subsequent effects on mCRC using diverse murine mCRC models. In vitro studies with genetic and pharmacological interventions were used to map the noncanonical HER3 pathway. RESULTS: We demonstrated that EC-secreted leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) directly binds and activates HER3 and promotes CRC growth distinct from neuregulin, the canonical HER3 ligand. Blocking host-derived LRG1 by gene knockout or a neutralizing antibody impaired mCRC outgrowth in the liver and prolonged mouse survival. We identified protein synthesis activated by the PI3K-PDK1-RSK-eIF4B axis as the biologically relevant signaling cascade downstream of the LRG1-HER3 interaction, which was not blocked by conventional HER3-specific antibodies that failed in prior clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: LRG1 is a novel HER3 ligand and mediates liver-mCRC crosstalk. The LRG1-HER3 signaling axis is distinct from canonical HER3 signaling and represents a new therapeutic opportunity to treat patients with mCRC, and potentially other types of liver metastases.",

Recently, increasing evidence has linked the presence of intratumoral Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) with the malignant progression and therapeutic resistance of multiple tumor types, but its influence on NPC has remained largely unknown. We found that Fn is prevalent in the tumor tissue of patients with NPC and is associated with radioresistance. Fn invaded and proliferated inside NPC cells and aggravated tumor progression. Mechanistically, Fn slowed mitochondrial dysfunction by promoting mitochondrial fusion and decreasing ROS generation, preventing radiation-induced oxidative damage. Fn inhibited PANoptosis by the SLC7A5/leucine-mTORC1 axis during irradiation stress, thus promoting radioresistance. Treatment with the mitochondria-targeted antibiotics or dietary restriction of leucine reduced intratumoral Fn load, resensitizing tumors to radiotherapy in vivo. These findings demonstrate that Fn has the potential to be a predictive marker for radioresistance and to help guide individualized treatment for patients with NPC.",

Early diagnosis of the disease improves the outcomes. There is an urgent need for new biomarkers with greater discriminative precision for diagnosis, risk-stratification and treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of Fetuin-A and LRG1 in patients with PC. METHODS: Serum levels of Fetuin-A and LRG1 were compared in patients with PC (n=46), a control group 1 including young, healthy subjects (n=26) and control group 2 including patients with negative prostate biopsy (n=46). In PC patients, the levels of both biomarkers were compared in subgroups with different tumour characteristics. RESULTS: We demonstrated a statistically significant higher concentrations of Fetuin-A in PC patients compared to control group 2 (439 mg/L vs. 372 mg/L), P<0.001. No statistically significant difference was found between PC patients and control group 1, nor for LRG1 levels between the three groups. In PC patients, higher serum levels of LRG1 were found in M1 patients compared to M0 (98 mg/L vs. 42 mg/L), P=0.059. CONCLUSION: Fetuin-A levels are significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer than in patients without malignancy but LRG1 levels do not differ between patients with PC and controls."

      "abstract": "Nutritional cues during embryonic development can alter developmental trajectories and affect postnatal growth. However, the specific mechanisms by which nutrients influence avian growth remain largely unknown. Amino acids can directly interact with the nutrient-sensing pathways, such as the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, which are known to regulate growth. We examined the effects of embryonic leucine on gene expression and phenotypic growth in Japanese quails by injecting 2.5 mg leucine or saline (control) into Japanese quail eggs on the tenth day of incubation and incubating them under standard conditions. The treatment groups had similar hatching success and size at hatching. However, between 3 and 7 days post-hatching, quails treated with embryonic leucine showed increased growth in body mass and wing, tarsus, head, and intestinal lengths, lasting up to 21 days. The hepatic expression of IGF1, IGF1R, mTOR, and RPS6K1 was upregulated in leucine-treated quails, while the expression of FOXO1 remained unaffected. In conclusion, a subtle increase in embryonic leucine may induce developmental programming effects in Japanese quail by interacting with the IGF-1/mTOR nutrient-sensing pathway to promote growth. This study highlights the role of embryonic amino acids as crucial nutrients for enhancing growth. It provides valuable insight into nutrient intervention strategies during embryonic development to potentially improve poultry growth performance."

However, we hypothesized that the negative effect of using CFP in diets for weanling pigs may be overcome if diets are fortified with crystalline sources of Val, Trp, and (or) Ile. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty weanling pigs were randomly allotted to one of 10 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design, with 4 pigs per pen and 8 replicate pens per treatment. A corn-soybean meal diet and 2 basal diets based on corn and 10% CFP or corn and 20% CFP were formulated. Seven additional diets were formulated by fortifying the basal diet with 20% CFP with Ile, Trp, Val, Ile and Val, Ile and Trp, Trp and Val, or Ile, Trp and Val. A two-phase feeding program was used, with d 1 to 14 being phase 1 and d 15 to 28 being phase 2. Fecal scores were recorded every other day. Blood samples were collected on d 14 and 28 from one pig per pen. On d 14, fecal samples were collected from one pig per pen in 3 of the 10 treatments to determine volatile fatty acids, ammonium concentration, and microbial protein. These pigs were also euthanized and ileal tissue was collected. RESULTS: There were no effects of dietary treatments on any of the parameters evaluated in phase 1. Inclusion of 10% or 20% CFP in diets reduced (P < 0.05) final body weight on d 28, and average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) in phase 2 and for the entire experimental period. However, pigs fed the CFP diet supplemented with Val, Ile, and Trp had final body weight, ADFI, ADG and gain to feed ratio in phase 2 and for the entire experiment that was not different from pigs fed the control diet. Fecal scores in phase 2 were reduced (P < 0.05) if CFP was used. CONCLUSIONS: Corn fermented protein may be included by up to 20% in diets for weanling pigs without affecting growth performance, gut health, or hindgut fermentation, if diets are fortified with extra Val, Trp, and Ile. Inclusion of CFP also improved fecal consistency of pigs."

They also promote muscle recovery and contribute to glucose homeostasis. Recent studies in critically ill patients have demonstrated that depletion of plasma leucine is associated with increased mortality, but data in the non-critical care setting is lacking. METHODS: This secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Effect of early nutritional support on Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of malnourished medical inpatients Trial (EFFORT), investigated the impact of leucine, isoleucine, and valine metabolism on clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was 180-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among 238 polymorbid patients with available metabolite measurements, low serum leucin levels were associated with a doubled risk of 180-day all-cause mortality in a fully adjusted regression model (adjusted HR 2.20 [95% CI 1.46-3.30], p < 0.001). There was also an association with mortality for isoleucine (1.56 [95% CI 1.03-2.35], p = 0.035) and valine (1.69 [95% CI 1.13-2.53], p = 0.011). When comparing effects of nutritional support on mortality in patients with high and low levels of leucine, there was no evidence of significant differences in effectiveness of the intervention. The same was true for isoleucine and valine. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that depletion of leucine, isoleucine, and valine among malnourished polymorbid patients is associated with increases in long-term mortality. However, patients with low metabolite levels did not show a pronounced benefit from nutritional support. Further research should focus on the clinical effects of nutritional support in patients with depleted stores of essential branched-chain amino acids.

We investigate whether the potentially disease-modifying compound acetyl-DL-leucine (ADLL; 5 g/d) has an effect on prodromal PD progression in 2 iRBD-patients. Outcome parameters are RBD-severity sum-score (RBD-SS-3), dopamine-transporter single-photon emission computerized tomography (DAT-SPECT) and metabolic \"Parkinson-Disease-related-Pattern (PDRP)\"-z-score in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). After 3 weeks ADLL-treatment, the RBD-SS-3 drops markedly in both patients and remains reduced for >18 months of ADLL-treatment. In patient 1 (female), the DAT-SPECT putaminal binding ratio (PBR) decreases in the 5 years pretreatment from normal (1.88) to pathological (1.22) and the patient's FDG-PET-PDRP-z-score rises from 1.72 to 3.28 (pathological). After 22 months of ADLL-treatment, the DAT-SPECT-PBR increases to 1.67 and the FDG-PET-PDRP-z-score stabilizes at 3.18. Similar results are seen in patient 2 (male): his DAT-SPECT-PBR rises from a pretreatment value of 1.42 to 1.72 (close to normal) and the FDG-PET-PDRP-z-score decreases from 1.02 to 0.30 after 18 months of ADLL-treatment. These results support exploration of whether ADLL may have disease-modifying properties in prodromal PD.",

However, the impact of hypoxia-induced activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling on milk protein and fat synthesis remains unclear. L-leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, is known to modulate milk protein and fat synthesis. Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the effect of L-leucine on milk protein and fat synthesis under hypoxic conditions and shed light on the molecular mechanism using an in vitro model. The results indicated that hypoxia treatment significantly decreased the synthesis of α-casein and β-casein, as well as inhibited factors related to milk fat synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T). Additionally, hypoxia stress suppressed the activities of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and protein kinase B (AKT). Interfering with HIF-1α significantly reversed the expression of AKT, mTOR and factors related to milk synthesis. Importantly, supplementation with L-leucine activated AKT/mTOR signaling, thereby enhancing milk protein and fat synthesis in MAC-T cells to some extent. In conclusion, these findings suggest that HIF-1 signaling plays an important role in milk synthesis and that L-leucine may stimulate the synthesis of milk protein and fat by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway under hypoxic conditions, making it a potential additive for promoting milk synthesis inhibited by hypoxia.",

      "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), particularly leucine, are indispensable AAs for immune regulation through metabolic rewiring. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. Our investigation revealed that T-cell receptor (TCR)-activated human CD4+ T cells increase the expression of BCAT1, a cytosolic enzyme responsible for BCAA catabolism, and SLC7A5, a major BCAA transporter. This upregulation facilitates increased leucine influx and catabolism, which are particularly crucial for Th17 responses. Activated CD4+ T cells induce an alternative pathway of cytosolic leucine catabolism, generating a pivotal metabolite, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid (HMB), by acting on BCAT1 and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD)/HPD-like protein (HPDL). Inhibition of BCAT1-mediated cytosolic leucine metabolism, either with BCAT1 inhibitor 2 (Bi2) or through BCAT1, HPD, or HPDL silencing using shRNA, attenuates IL-17 production, whereas HMB supplementation abrogates this effect. Mechanistically, HMB contributes to the regulation of the mTORC1-HIF1α pathway, a major signaling pathway for IL-17 production, by increasing the mRNA expression of HIF1α. This finding was corroborated by the observation that treatment with L-β-homoleucine (LβhL), a leucine analog and competitive inhibitor of BCAT1, decreased IL-17 production by TCR-activated CD4+ T cells. In an in vivo experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, blockade of BCAT1-mediated leucine catabolism, either through a BCAT1 inhibitor or LβhL treatment, mitigated EAE severity by decreasing HIF1α expression and IL-17 production in spinal cord mononuclear cells. Our findings elucidate the role of BCAT1-mediated cytoplasmic leucine catabolism in modulating IL-17 production via HMB-mediated regulation of mTORC1-HIF1α, providing insights into its relevance to inflammatory conditions.",

      "abstract": "Chemoresistance is one of the difficulties in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), and the enhanced stemness of tumor cells is the underlying contributing factor. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) is a classical marker of CRC stem cells and can be an important potential target for CRC chemotherapy. Quinoa, a protein-rich plant, offers potential as a source of high-quality active peptides. Novelly, the study obtained quinoa protein hydrolysate (QPH) from whole quinoa grains by simulated digestion. In vivo experiments revealed that the tumor volume in the 5-FU+QPH group decreased from 145.90 ± 13.35 to 94.49 ± 13.05 mm3 in the 5-FU group, suggesting that QPH enhances the chemosensitivity of CRC. Further, the most effective peptide QPH-FR from 631 peptides in QPH was screened by activity prediction, molecular docking, and experimental validation. Mechanistically, QPH-FR competitively suppressed the formation of the LGR5/RSPO1 complex by binding to LGR5, causing RNF43/ZNRF3 to ubiquitinate the FZD receptor, thereby suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and exerting stemness inhibition. In summary, the study proposes that a novel peptide QPH-FR from quinoa elucidates the mechanism by which QPH-FR targets LGR5 to enhance chemosensitivity, providing theoretical support for the development of chemotherapeutic adjuvant drugs based on plant peptides.",

To further confirm the role of MELK in Burkitt lymphoma treatment, we describe herein a structure-guided design of PROTACs targeting MELK. Through design, computer-assisted optimization and SAR studies, we developed the first-in-class MELK-targeting PROTAC MGP-39, which promoted a rapid and potent degradation of MELK in RAMOS cells. Additionally, the newly designed MELK degrader induced significant cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Notably, compared to MELK inhibitors, MGP-39 has better anti-cancer activity and lower toxicity, indicating the practical role of PROTACs in avoiding the side effects of traditional inhibitors. More importantly, our results show that the use of a PROTAC can be adopted as a general and effective strategy for targeted cancer therapy."

The incremental progression of widely variable symptoms with a prominent behavioral disturbance can conceal the disease and prompt an initial psychiatric diagnosis. Although specific MRI findings ought to be evident by the time the disease progresses to frank limbic encephalitis, it appears inconsistent and ill-defined and is thus unreliable. Nevertheless, brain imaging remains prominent in the discussion, even included in some guidelines for diagnosing anti-LGI1 LE. Here, we present a case of a patient who presented after a suicide attempt with a long history of psychiatric issues, aberrant \"spasms,\" and subsequently encephalopathy, who was eventually diagnosed with anti-LGI1 LE only after delayed CSF antibodies studies. In this patient, symptoms emerged over two years, with multiple brain MRIs being negative, including the one completed during the hospital admission in focus. The purpose of this case report is to encourage maintaining a broad differential when patients present with bizarre symptoms. This report underlies the importance of thorough clinical evaluation, utilization of multiple diagnostic resources, and the need for heightened awareness among healthcare providers about the subtleties of autoimmune encephalitis presentations. With anti-LGI1 LE already being severely underdiagnosed, it is important to continue reviewing various cases of patients who are diagnosed with anti-LGI1 LE and further review to understand its pathophysiology and common clinical presentation. This case also underscores the ongoing evolution in understanding anti-LGI1 LE and highlights that patients may present with unfamiliar symptoms or diagnostic challenges. The overall objective is to help providers recognize anti-LGI1 LE earlier, so treatment can be initiated sooner, leading to a better prognosis for patients."

      "abstract": "Protein persulfidation is a thiol-based oxidative posttranslational modification (oxiPTM) that involves the modification of susceptible cysteine thiol groups present in peptides and proteins through hydrogen sulfide (H2S), thus affecting their function. Using sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) fruits as a model material at different stages of ripening (immature green and ripe red), endogenous persulfidated proteins (persulfidome) were labeled using the dimedone switch method and identified using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS). A total of 891 persulfidated proteins were found in pepper fruits, either immature green or ripe red. Among these, 370 proteins were exclusively present in green pepper, 237 proteins were exclusively present in red pepper, and 284 proteins were shared between both stages of ripening. A comparative analysis of the pepper persulfidome with that described in Arabidopsis leaves allowed the identification of 25% of common proteins. Among these proteins, glutathione reductase (GR) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) were selected to evaluate the effect of persulfidation using an in vitro approach. GR activity was unaffected, whereas LAP activity increased by 3-fold after persulfidation. Furthermore, this effect was reverted through treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT). To our knowledge, this is the first persulfidome described in fruits, which opens new avenues to study H2S metabolism. Additionally, the results obtained lead us to hypothesize that LAP could be involved in glutathione (GSH) recycling in pepper fruits."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI-1) encephalitis is a rare form of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. Although relatively well documented in adults, pediatric cases are rare and remain poorly understood. METHODS: We reviewed two pediatric cases of LGI-1 encephalitis from a single tertiary care facility retrospectively. The detailed analysis included assessment of the initial presentation, clinical progression, diagnostic challenges, treatments, and outcome. To contextualize the differences between pediatric and adult manifestations of disease, we compared these findings with existing literature. RESULTS: Both cases illustrate the diagnostic challenges faced at initial presentation due to the rarity of this diagnosis in children and the absence of characteristic faciobrachial dystonic seizures, which is common in adults. The constellation of neuropsychiatric symptoms and refractory focal seizures led to a high clinical suspicion for autoimmune encephalitis, therefore, both cases were treated empirically with intravenous methylprednisolone. The diagnosis in both cases was confirmed with positive serum antibody testing, reinforcing that LGI-1 antibodies are more sensitive in the serum rather than the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Seizure control and improvement in cognitive symptoms was achieved through a combination of immunotherapy and antiseizure medications. CONCLUSIONS: This case series underscores the significance of considering LGI-1 encephalitis in the differential diagnosis of pediatric patients exhibiting unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms and focal seizures and emphasizes the importance of performing both serum and CSF antibody testing. It is necessary to conduct further research to identify the full range of pediatric presentations and to determine the optimal treatment protocol.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoids, which have long served as fundamental therapeutics for diverse inflammatory conditions, are still widely used, despite associated side effects limiting their long-term use. Among their key mediators is glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), recognized for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Here, we explore the immunomodulatory effects of GILZ in macrophages through transcriptomic analysis and functional assays. Bulk RNA sequencing of GILZ knockout and GILZ-overexpressing macrophages revealed significant alterations in gene expression profiles, particularly impacting pathways associated with the inflammatory response, phagocytosis, cell death, mitochondrial function, and extracellular structure organization activity. GILZ-overexpression enhances phagocytic and antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, potentially mediated by increased nitric oxide production. In addition, GILZ protects macrophages from pyroptotic cell death, as indicated by a reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GILZ transgenic macrophages. In contrast, GILZ KO macrophages produced more ROS, suggesting a regulatory role of GILZ in ROS-dependent pathways. Additionally, GILZ overexpression leads to decreased mitochondrial respiration and heightened matrix metalloproteinase activity, suggesting its involvement in tissue remodeling processes. These findings underscore the multifaceted role of GILZ in modulating macrophage functions and its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders, offering insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing the benefits of glucocorticoid therapy while minimizing adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Due to the lack of information on the effects of nutritional guidance focused on leucine intake in patients undergoing maintenance cardiac rehabilitation, this study investigated on plasma leucine concentrations, lean body mass, and muscle strength. METHODS: Nutritional guidance, focused on leucine (intervention group) or general nutritional guidance (control group), was provided for six months to patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation. Body composition, grip strength, hematological test results, and diet of both groups were compared before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Seven patients in the intervention group (53.2 ± 18.2 years) and 7 patients in the control group (58.6 ± 15.3 years) were included. Dietary survey results showed that the six-month intervention significantly (p < 0.05) increased protein intake and estimated leucine intake only in the intervention group. There was no significant difference in the rate of change in plasma leucine concentration between the two groups. The rate of change in lean body mass was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0.035). The rate of change in plasma leucine concentration and that in lean body mass was positively correlated only in the intervention group (r = 0.777, p = 0.040), and the rate of change in plasma leucine concentration was also positively correlated with the rate of change in grip strength (ρ = 0.857, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: In the patients undergoing maintenance cardiac rehabilitation, increased plasma leucine concentration by nutritional guidance focused on leucine increased lean body mass without any increasing the training load."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein (LRG) is a new serum biomarker reflecting the disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC), but its change during the acute phase has not been enough investigated. METHODS: Patients with UC who initiated the induction therapy with steroid or advanced therapy (biologics or Janus kinase inhibitors) were prospectively enrolled. Associations of LRG, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC) at baseline, week 1, and week 8 with clinical remission at week 8 and subsequent endoscopic improvement within 1 year (Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1) were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients with UC were included. LRG and CRP at week 1 were significantly lower in the clinical remission group than in the non-remission group (LRG, 20.6 μg/mL vs. 28.4 μg/mL, P< 0.001; CRP, 0.9 mg/dL vs. 2.3 mg/dL, P< 0.001) while FC demonstrated the difference between groups only at week 8. The area under the curves of week 1 LRG, CRP, and FC for week 8 clinical remission using the receiver operating characteristic curves analysis were 0.68, 0.71, and 0.57, respectively. Furthermore, LRG and CRP predicted subsequent endoscopic improvement as early as week 1, while FC was predictive only at week 8. CONCLUSIONS: LRG can be an early-phase biomarker predicting subsequent clinical and endoscopic response to induction therapy."

      "abstract": "Gliomas are highly malignant and invasive tumors lacking clear boundaries. Previous bioinformatics and experimental analyses have indicated that F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 6 (FBXL6), a protein crucial for the cell cycle and tumorigenesis, is highly expressed in certain types of tumors. The high expression level of FBXL6 is reported to promote tumor growth and adversely affect patient survival. However, the molecular mechanism, prognostic value and drug sensitivity of FBXL6 in glioma remain unclear. To address this, the present study analyzed FBXL6 expression in gliomas, utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas databases. Analysis of FBXL6 mRNA expression levels, combined with patient factors such as age, sex and tumor grade using Kaplan-Meier plots and nomograms, demonstrated a strong correlation between FBXL6 expression and glioma progression. Co-expression networks provided further insights into the biological function of FBXL6. Additionally, using CIBERSORT and TISDB tools, the correlation between FBXL6 expression correlation tumor-infiltrating immune cells and immune genes was demonstrated to be statistically significant. These findings were validated by examining FBXL6 mRNA and protein levels in glioma tissues using various techniques, including western blot, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. These assays demonstrated the role of FBXL6 in glioma progression. Furthermore, drug sensitivity analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between FBXL6 expression and various drugs, which indicated that FBXL6 may potentially act as a future promising therapeutic target in glioma treatment. Therefore, the present study identified FBXL6 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with gliomas and highlighted its potential role in glioma progression."

      "abstract": "Cells defend against oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant capacity, including stress-activated metabolic alterations, but the underlying intracellular signaling mechanisms remain unclear. This paper reports that immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat (ISLR) functions as a redox sensor that responds to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulation and modulates the antioxidant capacity by suppressing pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) activity. Following oxidative stress, ISLR perceives ROS stimulation through its cysteine residue 19, and rapidly degrades in the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The downregulated ISLR enhances the antioxidant capacity by promoting the tetramerization of PKM2, and then enhancing the pyruvate kinase activity, PKM2-mediated glycolysis is crucial to the ISLR-mediated antioxidant capacity. In addition, our results demonstrated that, in triple-negative breast cancer, cisplatin treatment reduced the level of ISLR, and PKM2 inhibition sensitizes tumors to cisplatin by enhancing ROS production; and argued that PKM2 inhibition can synergize with cisplatin to limit tumor growth. Our results demonstrate a molecular mechanism by which cells respond to oxidative stress and modulate the redox balance.",

In human, in addition to physiologic impacts, hair loss and hair related disorders can affect characteristic features, emotions, and social behaviors. Despite significant advancement, there is a dire need to explore alternative novel therapies with higher efficacy, less side effects and lower cost to promote hair growth to treat hair deficiency. Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) is a protein rapidly induced by glucocorticoids. Studies from our group and many others have suggested that a synthetic form of GILZ, TAT-GILZ, a fusion peptide of trans-activator of transcription and GILZ, can function as a potent regulator of inflammatory responses, re-establishing and maintaining the homeostasis. In this study, we investigate whether TAT-GILZ could promote and contribute to hair growth. For our pre-clinical model, we used 9-12 week-old male BALB/c and nude (athymic, nu/J) mice. We applied TAT-GILZ and/or TAT (vehicle) intradermally to depilated/hairless mice. Direct observation, histological examination, and Immunofluorescence imaging were used to assess the effects and compare different treatments. In addition, we tested two current treatment for hair loss/growth, finasteride and minoxidil, for optimal evaluation of TAT-GILZ in a comparative fashion. Our results showed, for the first time, that synthetic TAT-GILZ peptide accelerated hair growth on depilated dorsal skin of BALB/c and induced hair on the skin of athymic mice where hair growth was not expected. In addition, TAT-GILZ was able to enhance hair follicle stem cells and re-established the homeostasis by increasing counter inflammatory signals including higher regulatory T cells and glucocorticoid receptors. In conclusion, our novel findings suggest that reprofiling synthetic TAT-GILZ peptide could promote hair growth by increasing hair follicle stem cells and re-establishing homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (anti-LGI1) limbic encephalitis is a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder with antibodies against LGI1. It was first recognized as a disease in 2010 and represents the second most common cause of autoimmune encephalitis. Clinically, it is characterized by subacute changes in cognition, memory, and behavior, associated with hyponatremia and faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS). This report discusses a unique onset of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis where an elderly female presented with symptoms of new-onset panic attacks and rhythmic facial movements for one week. She was then admitted to neurology for further serum, cerebrospinal fluid(CSF), and lab testing. She was eventually found to be positive for antibodies against LGI1 voltage-gated potassium channels, which confirmed the diagnosis of limbic encephalitis. The quick recognition of symptoms and escalation of management allowed the patient to experience drastic improvements after the initiation of steroids, immunotherapy, and lacosamide. Since anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis is underdiagnosed, it can lead to irreversible long-term cognitive sequelae (i.e., memory deficits). Thus, awareness of the typically associated findings of FBDS, cognitive disturbances, psychiatric changes, and hyponatremia can aid in early diagnosis and prompt treatment with immunotherapy, allowing for more favorable outcomes."

However, it is rapidly oxidized by sodium hypochlorite, leading to its decomposition into carboxylic acid and nitrogen gas. In the synthesis of a novel poly(diacylhydrazine) as an oxidatively degradable polymer, L-leucine methyl ester is acylated by terephthaloyl chloride. Subsequent hydrazination yields a bishydrazide monomer. The oxidative coupling polymerization of this monomer produces poly(diacylhydrazine). The molecular structures of the products are confirmed by an 1H NMR analysis. A polymodal molecular weight distribution and a large polydispersity index are observed by GPC in all cases. A 10% weight loss temperature is noted at 286 °C in air by TGA. The obtained polymer is not oxidized by oxygen. No glass transition is observed below the decomposition temperature. Upon the treatment of the poly(diacylhydrazine) with sodium hypochlorite solution, decomposition occurs rapidly, resulting in monomeric carboxylic acid and nitrogen gas. The L-leucine-based poly(diacylhydrazine) serves as a novel on-demand degradable polymer with high levels of thermal and chemical stability during usage."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR) is a cyanobacterial hepatotoxic toxin found in water sources worldwide, including in northeastern Thailand, where opisthorchiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is most prevalent. MC-LR is a potential carcinogen; however, its involvement in liver fluke-associated CCA remains ambiguous. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of MC-LR on the progression of CCA via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in vitro. METHODS: Cell division, migration, cell cycle transition, and MC-LR transporter expression were evaluated in vitro through MTT assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Following a 24-h treatment of cultured cells with 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 nM of MC-LR, the proliferative effect of MC-LR on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was investigated using immunoblotting and qRT-PCR analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine β-catenin expression in CCA tissue compared to adjacent tissue. RESULTS: Human immortalized cholangiocyte cells (MMNK-1) and a human cell line established from opisthorchiasis-associated CCA (KKU-213B) expressed the MC-LR transporter and internalized MC-LR. Exposure to 10 nM and 100 nM of MC-LR notably enhanced cells division and migration in both cell lines (P < 0.05) and markedly elevated the percentage of S phase cells (P < 0.05). MC-LR elevated PP2A expression by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and suppressing phosphatase activity. Inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex genes (Axin1 and APC) led to the upregulation of β-catenin and its downstream target genes (Cyclin D1 and c-Jun). Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by MSAB confirmed these results. Additionally, β-catenin was significantly expressed in cancerous tissue compared to adjacent areas (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MC-LR promotes cell proliferation and progression of CCA through Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Further evaluation using invivo experiments is needed to confirm this observation. This finding could promote health awareness regarding MC-LR intake and risk of CCA."

      "abstract": "JAK2/STAT3/MYC axis is dysregulated in nearly 70 % of human cancers, but targeting this pathway therapeutically remains a big challenge in cancer therapy. In this study, genes associated with JAK2, STAT3, and MYC were analyzed, and potential target genes were selected. Leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein (LRPPRC) whose function and regulation are not fully understood, emerged as one of top 3 genes in terms of RNA epigenetic modification. Here, we demonstrate LRPPRC may be an independent prognostic indicator besides JAK2, STAT3, and MYC. Mechanistically, LRPPRC impairs N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of JAK2, STAT3, and MYC to facilitate nuclear mRNA export and expression. Meanwhile, excess LRPPRC act as a scaffold protein binding to JAK2 and STAT3 to enhance stability of JAK2-STAT3 complex, thereby facilitating JAK2/STAT3/MYC axis activation to promote esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) progression. Furthermore, 5,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone was verified to bind to LRPPRC, STAT3, and CDK1, dissociating LRPPRC-JAK2-STAT3 and JAK2-STAT3-CDK1 interaction, leading to impaired tumorigenesis in 4-Nitroquinoline N-oxide induced ESCC mouse models and suppressed tumor growth in ESCC patient derived xenograft mouse models. In summary, this study suggests regulation of m6A modification by LRPPRC, and identifies a novel triplex target compound, suggesting that targeting LRPPRC-mediated JAK2/STAT3/MYC axis may overcome JAK2/STAT3/MYC dependent tumor therapeutic dilemma.",

The authors introduce a novel near-infrared fluorescent probe, NTAP, designed for LAP detection. They describe the synthesis of the probe and evaluate its spectral properties, including the LOD was 0.0038 U/mL, and QY was 0.32 %. The kinetic properties of NTAP, such as the relationship between LAP concentration (0-0.08 U/mL), reaction time (3 min), and fluorescence excitation spectra (475 nm) and emission spectra (715 nm) are investigated. The article also discusses the stability and selectivity of the probe and its ability to detect LAP in complex samples. Cellular imaging experiments demonstrate the NATP specificity and selectivity in detecting LAP activity and its inhibition. Animal models of liver and lung metastasis are used to evaluate the probe's imaging capabilities, showing its ability to accurately locate and detect metastatic lesions. The article concludes by emphasizing the potential applications of the NTAP probe in early tumor diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and the study of tumor metastasis mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Statins, or hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, are one of the most commonly prescribed medications for lowering cholesterol. Myopathic side-effects ranging from pain and soreness to critical rhabdomyolysis are commonly reported and often lead to discontinuation. The pathophysiological mechanism is, in general, ascribed to a downstream reduction of Coenzyme Q10 synthesis. HMG-CoA is a metabolite of leucine and its corresponding keto acid α-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), however, little is known about the changes in the metabolism of leucine and its metabolites in response to statins. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate if statin treatment has implications on the upstream metabolism of leucine to KIC and HMB, as well as on other branched chain amino acids (BCAA). DESIGN: 12 hyperlipidemic older adults under statin treatment were recruited. The study was conducted as a paired prospective study. Included participants discontinued their statin treatment for 4 weeks before they returned for baseline measurements (before). Statin treatment was then reintroduced, and the participants returned for a second study day 7 days after reintroduction (after statin). On study days, participants were injected with stable isotope pulses for measurement of the whole-body production (WBP) of all BCAA (leucine, isoleucine and valine), along with their respective keto acids and HMB. RESULTS: We found a reduced leucine WBP (22 %, p = 0.0033), along with a reduction in valine WBP (13 %, p = 0.0224). All other WBP of BCAA and keto acids were unchanged. There were no changes in the WBP of HMB. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that statin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase has an upstream impact on the turnover of leucine and valine. Whether this impairment in WBP of leucine may contribute to the known pathophysiological side effects of statins on muscle remains to be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder. Most patients have progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, frequent pulmonary infection, and an increased risk of malignancies. Although N-acetyl-dl-leucine (ADLL) has shown some efficacy in patients with AT, its more pharmacologically active enantiomer, N-acetyl-l-leucine (NALL), has just recently been investigated in ataxic individuals. The current study assessed the efficacy of NALL in patients with AT. METHODS: This 2 × 2 crossover, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 20 patients with AT. After excluding four patients, 16 subjects (eight females, eight males; mean age 9.8 ± 3.5 years) with a definitive genetic diagnosis of AT were randomly assigned to one of two study groups, with one group receiving 1-4 g/day NALL or a placebo for six weeks. Subjects then had a 4-week washout before crossing over to the other treatment for an additional six weeks. The Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI) and the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score assessed patients' motor function. Quality of life (QOL) was evaluated by a specialist using the PedsQL questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were taken from all subjects before and after each intervention to determine potential side effects. RESULTS: Although patients' nausea and constipation were improved, the results failed to reveal any significant benefits of NALL treatment on ataxia symptoms. NALL treatment had no significant effects on SARA, SCAFI-9HPT (9-hole peg test) nondominant, SCAFI-9HPT dominant, or SCAFI-8WMT (8 m walking time) (p > 0.05). Our patient's Physical Health score in Child self-report and Parent proxy-report did not significantly change in the treatment group compared to the placebo (p > 0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant changes in energy and macronutrient intake after NALL treatment. None of the volunteers reported serious or moderate side effects. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial exploring NALL's potential effects for treating AT. Despite improvements in some symptomss, NALL intervention failed to improve motor function significantly. However, patients' nausea and constipation were improved by NALL, which can be a relevant benefit clinically.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, no useful serum markers exist for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), making early detection challenging as diagnosis relies solely on imaging tests. Radiation exposure is also a concern due to multiple required CT examinations during treatment. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) histological types include ccRCC and non-clear cell RCC (non-ccRCC); however, treatment response to medications varies which necessitates accurate differentiation between the two. Therefore, we aimed to identify a novel serum marker of RCC. Increased LRG1 expression in the serum has been demonstrated in multiple cancer types. However, the expression of LRG1 expression in the serum and cancer tissues of patients with RCC has not been reported. Since ccRCC is a hypervascular tumor and LRG1 is capable of accelerating angiogenesis, we hypothesized that the LRG1 levels may be related to ccRCC. Therefore, we examined LRG1 expression in sera from patients with RCC. METHODS: Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, serum levels of leucine-rich-alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) were measured in 64 patients with ccRCC and 22 patients non-ccRCC who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy, as well as in 63 patients without cancer. RESULTS: Median values of serum LRG1 and their inter-quartile ranges were 63.2 (42.8-94.2) µg/mL in ccRCC, 23.4 (17.7-29.6) µg/mL in non-ccRCC, and 36.0 (23.7-56.7) µg/mL in patients without cancer, respectively (ccRCC vs. non-ccRCC or patients without cancer: P < 0.001). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (P = 0.002), anemia (P = 0.037), hypercalcemia (P = 0.023), and grade (P = 0.031) were independent predictors of serum LRG1 levels in ccRCC. To assess diagnostic performance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of serum LRG1 was utilized to differentiate ccRCC from non-cancer and non-ccRCC, with values of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82-0.96), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LRG1 served as a serum marker associated with inflammation, indicated by CRP, anemia, hypercalcemia, and malignant potential in ccRCC. Clinically, serum LRG1 levels may assist in differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC with excellent diagnostic accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Early detection of diseases can increase the chances of successful treatment and survival. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method for detecting or sensing biomolecules that cause trouble in living organisms. Disease sensors should possess specific properties, such as selectivity, reproducibility, stability, sensitivity, and morphology, for their routine application in medical diagnosis and treatment. This work focuses on biosensors in the form of surface-functionalized gold (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) prepared using a less-time-consuming, inexpensive, and efficient synthesis route. This allows for the production of highly pure and stable (non-aggregating without stabilizers) nanoparticles with a well-defined spherical shape, a desired diameter, and a monodisperse distribution in an aqueous environment, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Thus, these nanoparticles can be used routinely as biomarker sensors and drug-delivery platforms for precision medicine treatment. The NPs' surface was coated with phosphonate dipeptides of L-leucine (Leu; l-Leu-C(R1)(R2)PO3H2), and their adsorption was monitored using SERS. Reproducible spectra were analyzed to determine the orientation of the dipeptides (coating layers) on the nanoparticles' surface. The appropriate R2 side chain of the dipeptide can be selected to control the arrangement of these dipeptides. This allows for the proper formation of a layer covering the nanoparticles while also simultaneously interacting with the surrounding biological environment, such as cells, tissues, and biological fluids.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) in plants is activated upon recognition by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) of Damage- and Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs and MAMPs) from plants or microorganisms, respectively. An increasing number of identified DAMPs/MAMPs are carbohydrates from plant cell walls and microbial extracellular layers, which are perceived by plant PRRs, such as LysM and Leucine Rich Repeat-Malectin (LRR-MAL) receptor kinases (RKs). LysM-RKs (e.g. CERK1, LYK4 and LYK5) are needed for recognition of fungal MAMP chitohexaose (β-1,4-D-(GlcNAc)6, CHI6), whereas IGP1/CORK1, IGP3 and IGP4 LRR-MAL RKs are required for perception of β-glucans, like cellotriose (β-1,4-D-(Glc)3, CEL3) and mixed-linked glucans. We have explored the diversity of carbohydrates perceived by Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings by determining PTI responses upon treatment with different oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. These analyses revealed that plant oligosaccharides from xylans [β-1,4-D-(xylose)4 (XYL4)], glucuronoxylans and α-1,4-glucans, and polysaccharides from plants and seaweeds activate PTI. Cross-elicitation experiments of XYL4 with other glycans showed that the mechanism of recognition of XYL4 and the DAMP 33-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-xylotetraose (XA3XX) shares some features with that of CEL3 but differs from that of CHI6. Notably, XYL4 and XA3XX perception is impaired in igp1/cork1, igp3 and igp4 mutants, and almost not affected in cerk1 lyk4 lyk5 triple mutant. XYL4 perception is conserved in different plant species since XYL4 pre-treatment triggers enhanced disease resistance in tomato to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and PTI responses in wheat. These results expand the number of glycans triggering plant immunity and support IGP1/CORK1, IGP3 and IGP4 relevance in Arabidopsis thaliana glycans perception and PTI activation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The characterization of plant immune mechanisms involved in the perception of carbohydrate-based structures recognized as DAMPs/MAMPs is needed to further understand plant disease resistance modulation. We show here that IGP1/CORK1, IGP3 and IGP4 LRR-MAL RKs are required for the perception of carbohydrate-based DAMPs β-1,4-D-(xylose)4 (XYL4) and 33-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-xylotetraose (XA3XX), further expanding the function of these LRR-MAL RKs in plant glycan perception and immune activation."

This response requires Dual-leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK), a neuronal stress sensor that is a central regulator of axon regeneration and degeneration. The damage and repair aspects of this response are reminiscent of other cellular homeostatic systems, suggesting that a cytoskeletal homeostatic response exists. In this study, we propose a framework for understanding DLK mediated neuronal cytoskeletal homeostasis. We demonstrate that low dose nocodazole treatment activates DLK signaling. Activation of DLK signaling results in a DLK-dependent transcriptional signature, which we identify through RNA-seq. This signature includes genes likely to attenuate DLK signaling while simultaneously inducing actin regulating genes. We identify alterations to the cytoskeleton including actin-based morphological changes to the axon. These results are consistent with the model that cytoskeletal disruption in the neuron induces a DLK-dependent homeostatic mechanism, which we term the Cytoskeletal Stress Response (CSR) pathway.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme therapy remains a significant challenge since there is a lack of effective treatment for this cancer. As most of the examined gliomas express or overexpress cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ), we decided to use these proteins as therapeutic targets. Toxicity, antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and antimigratory activity of COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib-CXB) and/or PPARγ agonist (Fmoc-L-Leucine-FL) was examined in vitro on temozolomide resistant U-118 MG glioma cell line and comparatively on BJ normal fibroblasts and immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes. The in vivo activity of both agents was studied on C. elegans nematode. Both drugs effectively destroyed U-118 MG glioma cells via antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-migratory effects in a concentration range 50-100 µM. The mechanism of action of CXB and FL against glioma was COX-2 and PPARγ dependent and resulted in up-regulation of these factors. Unlike reports by other authors, we did not observe the expected synergistic or additive effect of both drugs. Comparative studies on normal BJ fibroblast cells and immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes showed that the tested drugs did not have a selective effect on glioma cells and their mechanism of action differs significantly from that observed in the case of glioma. HaCaTs did not react with concomitant changes in the expression of COX-2 and PPARγ and were resistant to FL. Safety tests of repurposing drugs used in cancer therapy tested on C. elegans nematode indicated that CXB, FL, or their mixture at a concentration of up to 100 µM had no significant effect on the entire nematode organism up to 4th day of incubation. After a 7-day treatment, CXB significantly shortened the lifespan of C. elegans at 25-400 µM concentration and body length at 50-400 µM concentration.",

Therefore, treatment with appropriate regulation may improve the blastocyst implantation ability. This study demonstrated that the combination of l-arginine (Arg) and l-leucine (Leu) exerts distinct effects on IVF-derived mouse blastocysts. Arg with Leu promotes blastocyst implantation, whereas Arg alone decreases the blastocyst ability. Integrin α5β1 expression was increased in blastocysts treated with Arg and Leu. Arg with Leu also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and showed a positive correlation with integrin α5β1. Ascorbic acid, an antioxidant, decreased ROS and integrin α5β1 levels, which were elevated by Arg with Leu. Meanwhile, the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in blastocysts did not differ between treatments. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is involved in ROS scavenging using glutathione (GSH) as a reductant. Arg with Leu decreased GPx4 and GSH levels in blastocysts, and blastocysts with higher ROS levels had lower GPx4 and GSH levels. In contrast, Arg alone increased the percentage of caspase-positive cells, indicating that Arg alone, which attenuated implantation ability, was associated with apoptosis. This study revealed that elevated ROS levels induced by Arg with Leu stimulated integrin α5β1 expression, thereby enhancing implantation capacity. Our results also suggest that ROS were not due to increased production by oxidative phosphorylation, but rather to a reduction in ROS degradation due to diminished GPx4 and GSH levels."

      "abstract": "In vertebrates, opioid peptides are thought to be involved in the regulation of reproduction; however, the significance of enkephalins in testicular function remains unclear. We examined the influence of δ-opioid receptor agonist leucine enkephalin (L-ENK) on the hypophysial-testicular axis of the cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus. Treatment with a low dose of L-ENK (60 µg) caused a significant increase in the numbers of primary and secondary spermatocytes and early and late spermatids, concomitant with intense immunolabelling of testicular androgen receptors, but did not significantly alter serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels compared to those of controls. Nevertheless, treatment with a high dose of L-ENK (200 µg) caused a significant reduction in the numbers of secondary spermatocytes as well as late spermatids associated with marginal immunolabelling of androgen receptors and significantly lower concentrations of serum 11-KT and LH compared to controls. In addition, the serum cortisol level was not affected in low-dose L-ENK-treated fish, but its level was significantly increased in the high-dose L-ENK-treated group. Together, these findings indicate that a low dose of L-ENK stimulates the germ cells at the meiosis stage and promotes further stages of spermatogenesis, whereas a high concentration of L-ENK inhibits spermatogenesis at the advanced stages. This effect appears to be mediated through the suppression of testicular steroidogenesis and the reduction of LH release in the pituitary gland of tilapia. The findings also suggest that elevated L-ENK levels in teleosts may exert their inhibitory influence on the hypophysial-testicular axis via glucocorticoids.",

      "abstract": "Pepper fruits contain two leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) genes which are differentially modulated during ripening and by nitric oxide. The LAP activity increases during ripening but is negatively modulated by nitration. Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) is an essential metalloenzyme that cleaves N-terminal leucine residues from proteins but also metabolizes dipeptides and tripeptides. LAPs play a fundamental role in cell protein turnover and participate in physiological processes such as defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses, but little is known about their involvement in fruit physiology. This study aims to identify and characterize genes encoding LAP and evaluate their role during the ripening of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) fruits and under a nitric oxide (NO)-enriched environment. Using a data-mining approach of the pepper plant genome and fruit transcriptome (RNA-seq), two LAP genes, designated CaLAP1 and CaLAP2, were identified. The time course expression analysis of these genes during different fruit ripening stages showed that whereas CaLAP1 decreased, CaLAP2 was upregulated. However, under an exogenous NO treatment of fruits, both genes were downregulated. On the contrary, it was shown that during fruit ripening LAP activity increased by 81%. An in vitro assay of the LAP activity in the presence of different modulating compounds including peroxynitrite (ONOO-), NO donors (S-nitrosoglutathione and nitrosocyteine), reducing agents such as reduced glutathione (GSH), L-cysteine (L-Cys), and cyanide triggered a differential response. Thus, peroxynitrite and reducing compounds provoked around 50% inhibition of the LAP activity in green immature fruits, whereas cyanide upregulated it 1.5 folds. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of LAP in pepper fruits as well as of its regulation by diverse modulating compounds. Based on the capacity of LAP to metabolize dipeptides and tripeptides, it could be hypothesized that the LAP might be involved in the GSH recycling during the ripening process.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to investigate the expression of acidic leucine-rich nuclear protein phosphatase 32B (ANP32B) in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and evaluate the effect of ANP32B on the proliferation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells. METHODS: We evaluated the expression of ANP32B in PRAD tissues and cells compared to the controls obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). siRNA targeting ANP32B was transfected into DU145 cells to knockdown the ANP32B expression and plasmids carrying ANP32B coding region were used to overexpress ANP32B in PC3 cells. We analyze the knockdown or overexpression efficiency of ANP32B with quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. CCK-8 assay, cell colony formation assay, transwell assay, and EdU labeling were performed to investigate the function of ANP32B on the progression of PRAD. Finally, the expression of the cell cycle marker, apoptosis marker, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: ANP32B expression was upregulated in PRAD samples compared to normal samples. Exogenous ANP32B overexpression promoted cell viability, cell colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, and cell migration. Inhibition of ANP32B suppressed cell proliferation, growth, and migration. At the molecular level, the genes promoting cell growth and migration, including cyclin D1 and N-cadherin, were significantly upregulated after ANP32B overexpression, whereas those inhibiting cell growth and migration such as cleaved caspase 3 and E-cadherin were downregulated. CONCLUSION: The tumor-promoting function of ANP32B can be attributed to its capacity to facilitate cell progression, and it may be considered as a therapeutic marker for PRAD therapy.",

MD simulations and MM/GBSA calculations were performed to check the agreement between different prediction methods for these inhibitors. 331 experimental ligands were collected, and 170 were used to build the structure-activity relationship. Eight representative ligand structural models were employed in similarity searching and pharmacophore screening over 14 million compounds. The process for selecting proper molecular descriptors provides a successful sample which can be used as a general strategy in QSAR modelling.

      "abstract": "Many genes with distinct molecular functions have been linked to genetically heterogeneous amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including SuperOxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) and Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP). SOD1 converts superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. VCP acts as a chaperon to regulate protein degradation and synthesis and various other cellular responses. Although the functions of these two genes differ, in the current report we show that overexpression of wild-type VCP in mice enhances lifespan and maintains the size of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of both male and female SOD1G93A mice, a well-known ALS mouse model. Although VCP exerts multiple functions, its regulation of ER formation and consequent protein synthesis has been shown to play the most important role in controlling dendritic spine formation and social and memory behaviors. Given that SOD1 mutation results in protein accumulation and aggregation, it may direct VCP to the protein degradation pathway, thereby impairing protein synthesis. Since we previously showed that the protein synthesis defects caused by Vcp deficiency can be improved by leucine supplementation, to confirm the role of the VCP-protein synthesis pathway in SOD1-linked ALS, we applied leucine supplementation to SOD1G93A mice and, similar to Vcp overexpression, we found that it extends SOD1G93A mouse lifespan. In addition, the phenotypes of reduced muscle strength and fewer NMJs of SOD1G93A mice are also improved by leucine supplementation. These results support the existence of crosstalk between SOD1 and VCP and suggest a critical role for protein synthesis in ASL. Our study also implies a potential therapeutic treatment for ALS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder that can be treated with immunotherapy, but the symptoms that remain after treatment have not been well described. We aimed to characterise the clinical features of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis for 1 year starting within the first year after initial immunotherapy. METHODS: For this prospective cohort study, we recruited patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis as soon as possible after they had received conventional immunotherapy for initial symptoms; patients were recruited from 21 hospitals in Spain. Patients were excluded if they had an interval of more than 1 year since initial immunotherapy, had pre-existing neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders, or were unable to travel to Hospital Clínic de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain). Patients visited Hospital Clínic de Barcelona on three occasions-the first at study entry (visit 1), the second 6 months later (visit 2), and the third 12 months after the initial visit (visit 3). They underwent neuropsychiatric and videopolysomnography assessments at each visit. Healthy participants who were matched for age and sex and recruited from Hospital Clínic de Barcelona underwent the same investigations at study entry and at 12 months. Cross-sectional comparisons of clinical features between groups were done with conditional logistic regression, and binary logistic regression was used to assess associations between cognitive outcomes at 12 months and clinical features before initial immunotherapy and at study entry. FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2019, and Sept 30, 2022, 42 participants agreed to be included in this study. 24 (57%) participants had anti-LGI1 encephalitis (mean age 63 years [SD 12]; 13 [54%] were female and 11 [46%] were male) and 18 (43%) were healthy individuals (mean age 62 years [10]; 11 [61%] were female and seven [39%] were male). At visit 1 (median 88 days [IQR 67-155] from initiation of immunotherapy), all 24 patients had one or more symptoms; 20 (83%) patients had cognitive deficits, 20 (83%) had psychiatric symptoms, 14 (58%) had insomnia, 12 (50%) had rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep behaviour disorder, nine (38%) had faciobrachial dystonic seizures, and seven (29%) had focal onset seizures. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures were unnoticed in four (17%) of 24 patients and focal onset seizures were unnoticed in five (21%) patients. At visit 1, videopolysomnography showed that 19 (79%) patients, but no healthy participants, had disrupted sleep structure (p=0·013); 15 (63%) patients and four (22%) healthy participants had excessive fragmentary myoclonus (p=0·039), and nine (38%) patients, but no healthy participants, had myokymic discharges (p=0·0051). These clinical and videopolysomnographic features led to additional immunotherapy in 15 (63%) of 24 patients, which resulted in improvement of these features in all 15 individuals. However, at visit 3, 13 (65%) of 20 patients continued to have cognitive deficits. Persistent cognitive deficits at visit 3 were associated with no use of rituximab before visit 1 (odds ratio [OR] 4·0, 95% CI 1·5-10·7; p=0·0015), REM sleep without atonia at visit 1 (2·2, 1·2-4·2; p=0·043), and presence of LGI1 antibodies in serum at visit 1 (11·0, 1·1-106·4; p=0·038). INTERPRETATION: Unsuspected but ongoing clinical and videopolysomnography alterations are common in patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis during the first year or more after initial immunotherapy. Recognising these alterations is important as they are treatable, can be used as outcome measures in clinical trials, and might influence cognitive outcome. FUNDING: Fundació La Caixa.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factors are plant-specific and play important roles in plant defense against environmental stresses. Identification and functional studies have been carried out in model plants such as rice, Arabidopsis thaliana, and poplar, but comprehensive analysis on the HD-Zip family of Salix suchowensis have not been reported. RESULTS: A total of 55 HD-Zip genes were identified in the willow genome, unevenly distributed on 18 chromosomes except for chromosome 19. And segmental duplication events containing SsHD-Zip were detected on all chromosomes except chromosomes 13 and 19. The SsHD-Zip were classified into 4 subfamilies subfamilies (I-IV) according to the evolutionary analysis, and members of each subfamily shared similar domain structure and gene structure. The combination of GO annotation and promoter analysis showed that SsHD-Zip genes responded to multiple abiotic stresses. Furthermore, the results of qPCR analysis showed that the SsHD-Zip I gene exhibited different degrees of expression under salt stress, PEG treatment and heat treatment. Moreover, there was a synergistic effect between SsHD-Zip I genes under stress conditions based on coregulatory networks analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, HD-Zip transcription factors were systematically identified and analyzed at the whole genome level. These results preliminarily clarified the structural characteristics and related functions of willow HD-Zip family members, and it was found that SsHox34, SsHox36 and SsHox51 genes were significantly involved in the response to various stresses. Together, these findings laid the foundation for further research on the resistance functions of willow HD-Zip genes.",

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to explore the regulatory mechanism of leucine (Leu) on lipid metabolism of finishing pigs. Twenty-four Duroc × Landrace × Large cross pigs with an average body weight of 68.33 ± 0.97 kg were randomly allocated into 3 treatment groups with 8 replicates per group (1 pig per replicate). The dietary treatments were as follows: control group (CON), 0.25% Leu group and 0.50% Leu group. The experimental period was 42 d. The results showed as follows. (1) Compared with the CON, 0.25% and 0.50% Leu increased (P < 0.01) the average daily gain (ADG), while the average backfat thickness (ABT) and the ratio of feed intake to body weight gain (F:G ratio) were decreased (P < 0.05). (2) In the 0.25% Leu group, the relative mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), recombinant fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), chemerin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) were decreased but the level of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) and fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) were increased in backfat tissue. In the 0.25% Leu group, the protein levels of p-Rictor, p-Raptor, p-eIF4E-binding protein 1 (p-4EBP1), p-silent mating type information regulator 2 homolog 1 (p-SIRT1) and acetylation ribosome s6 protein kinase 1 (Ac-S6K1) were increased (P < 0.05). (3) Compared to the CON, the diversity of gut microbiota in the 0.25% Leu group was increased. Principal component analysis showed that the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus and Desulfovibrio was higher in the 0.25% Leu group than the CON, but the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Treponema and Shigella was lower than in the CON (P < 0.05). (4) Four different metabolites were screened out from the serum of finishing pigs including allolithocholic acid (alloLCA), isolithocholic acid (isoLCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), which correlate to various degrees with the above microorganisms. In conclusion, Leu could promote adipose tissue lipolysis of finishing pigs through the mTOR-SIRT1 signaling pathway, and S6K1 is acetylated at the same time, and the interaction between gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism is also involved."

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled, and multicenter clinical trial was conducted in patients with cancer and malnutrition. The trial compared prescribed dietary advice and two packs per day, for 8 weeks, of a hypercaloric (400 kcal/pack) and hyperproteic ONS (20 g/pack) with fiber and specific ingredients (leucine, EPA and DHA, and beta-glucans) (enhanced-ONS) versus an isocaloric and isoproteic formula (standard-ONS) without specific ingredients. Food intake was assessed with a 3-day dietary survey, and adherence to the supplement with a patient self-completed diary. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients completed the intervention period. The combined intervention of dietary advice and ONS managed to increase the energy intake of the overall cohort by 792.55 (378.57) kcal/day, protein by 40.72 (19.56) g/day. Increases in energy and nutrient intakes were observed in both groups, both in dietary intake and associated exclusively with the supplement. The group that received the enhanced-ONS ingested a greater volume of product when there was a greater severity of malnutrition; a tumor location in the head, neck, upper digestive area, liver, or pancreas; more advanced stages of the tumor; or the receipt of more than one antineoplastic treatment. CONCLUSION: The use of an enhanced-ONS helps meet the nutritional requirements of cancer patients, especially those who have a more compromised clinical condition, with high adherence, good tolerance, and acceptance.",

AXL is associated with resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR-mutated (EGFRM) NSCLC. We investigated the effects of Leucine zipper downregulated in cancer-1 (LDOC1) on EGFR CMI and NSCLC treatment. Coimmunoprecipitation, double immunofluorescence staining, confocal microscopy analysis, cell surface labelling assays, and immunohistochemistry studies were conducted. We revealed that LDOC1 interacts with clathrin adaptors through binding motifs. LDOC1 depletion promotes internalization and plasma membrane recycling of EGFR in EGFRM NSCLC PC9 and HCC827 cells. Membranous and cytoplasmic EGFR decreased and increased, respectively, in LDOC1 (-) NSCLC tumors. LDOC1 depletion enhanced and sustained activation of EGFR, AXL, and HER2 and enhanced activation of HER3 in PC9 and HCC827 cells. Sensitivity to first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) was significantly reduced in LDOC1-depleted PC9 and HCC827 cells. Moreover, LDOC1 downregulation was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with poor overall survival in patients with EGFRM NSCLC receiving gefitinib (n = 100). In conclusion, LDOC1 may regulate the efficacy of first-generation EGFR-TKIs by participating in the CMI of EGFR. Accordingly, LDOC1 may function as a prognostic biomarker for EGFRM NSCLC.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue. The role of heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) in heat stress-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy has been well demonstrated; however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Essential amino acids, such as leucine, mainly mediate muscle protein synthesis. We investigated the effects of pre-heating and increased Hsp72 expression on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and protein synthesis following leucine administration in rat gastrocnemius muscle. To ensure increased Hsp72 expression in both the red and white portions of the muscle, one leg of male Wistar rats (10-week-old, n = 23) was heat-stressed in 43 °C water for 30 min twice at a 48-h-interval (heat-stressed leg, HS leg). The contralateral leg served as a non-heated internal control (CT leg). After the recovery period (48 h), rats were divided into the pre-administration or oral leucine administration groups. We harvested the gastrocnemius muscle (red and white parts) prior to administration and 30 and 90 min after leucine treatment (n = 7-8 per group) and intramuscular signaling responses to leucine ingestion were determined using western blotting. Heat stress significantly upregulated the expression of Hsp72 and was not altered by leucine administration. Although the phosphorylation levels of mTOR/S6K1 and ERK were similar regardless of heating, 4E-BP1 was less phosphorylated in the HS legs than the CT legs after leucine administration in the red portion of the muscles (P < 0.05). Moreover, c-Myc expression differed significantly after leucine administration in both the red and white portions of the muscles. Our findings indicate that following oral leucine administration, pre-heating partially blunted the muscle protein synthesis signaling response in the rat gastrocnemius muscle.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare lysosomal storage disorder. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of N-acetyl-l-leucine (NALL), an agent that potentially ameliorates lysosomal and metabolic dysfunction, for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we randomly assigned patients 4 years of age or older with genetically confirmed Niemann-Pick disease type C in a 1:1 ratio to receive NALL for 12 weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks, or to receive placebo for 12 weeks, followed by NALL for 12 weeks. NALL or matching placebo was administered orally two to three times per day, with patients 4 to 12 years of age receiving weight-based doses (2 to 4 g per day) and those 13 years of age or older receiving a dose of 4 g per day. The primary end point was the total score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA; range, 0 to 40, with lower scores indicating better neurologic status). Secondary end points included scores on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index, and the Modified Disability Rating Scale. Crossover data from the two 12-week periods in each group were included in the comparisons of NALL with placebo. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients 5 to 67 years of age were enrolled. The mean baseline SARA total scores used in the primary analysis were 15.88 before receipt of the first dose of NALL (60 patients) and 15.68 before receipt of the first dose of placebo (59 patients; 1 patient never received placebo). The mean (±SD) change from baseline in the SARA total score was -1.97±2.43 points after 12 weeks of receiving NALL and -0.60±2.39 points after 12 weeks of receiving placebo (least-squares mean difference, -1.28 points; 95% confidence interval, -1.91 to -0.65; P<0.001). The results for the secondary end points were generally supportive of the findings in the primary analysis, but these were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar with NALL and placebo, and no treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C, treatment with NALL for 12 weeks led to better neurologic status than placebo. A longer period is needed to determine the long-term effects of this agent in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and metabolic alterations of cancer cachexia are often associated with negative weight loss and muscle mass wasting. In this sense, protein supplementation can be a strategy to help counteract the loss and/or maintenance of mass in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of leucine supplementation on body composition in outpatients with gastrointestinal tract cancer. METHODS: It was a randomized, blinded, controlled, parallel trial, performed in male patients with a cancer diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract and appendix organs undergoing chemotherapy. All the patients were allocated to one of the protocol groups: L-leucine supplement or the control group, during 8 weeks of intervention. We evaluated the body composition through bioelectrical impedance analysis, the cancer cachexia classification, and the diet intake before and after the intervention protocol. The intention-to-treat approach was performed to predict the missing values for all patients who provide any observation data. RESULTS: The patients were an average age of 65.11 ± 7.50 years old. In the body composition analysis with patients who finished all the supplementation, we observed a significant gain in body weight (61.79.9 ± 9.02 versus 64.06 ± 9.45, p = 0.01), ASMM (7.64 ± 1.24 versus 7.81 ± 1.20, p = 0.02) in the Leucine group, whereas patients in the control did not present significant variation in these parameters. There was no significant intergroup difference. While in the analysis included the patients with intention-to-treat, we found a significant increase in body weight (p = 0.01), BMI (p = 0.01), FFM (p = 0.03), and ASMM (p = 0.01) in the Leucine group. No significant intergroup differences. These results also similar among cachectic patients. CONCLUSION: A balanced diet enriched with free-Leucine supplementation was able to promotes gains in body weight and lean mass in older men diagnosticated with gastrointestinal and appendix organs of digestion cancer after 8 weeks. However, the fact that most men are non-cachectic or pre-cachectic is not clear if the increase in muscle mass was due to a high intake of leucine, since no difference between groups was detected. Moreover, we know that benefits on body composition are due to adequate calorie and macronutrients consumption and that balanced feeding according to nutrition Guidelines seems crucial and must be advised during the oncological treatment.",

      "abstract": "Third-degree burn injuries pose a significant health threat. Safer, easier-to-use, and more effective techniques are urgently needed for their treatment. We hypothesized that covalently bonded conjugates of fatty acids and tripeptides can form wound-compatible hydrogels that can accelerate healing. We first designed conjugated structures as fatty acid-aminoacid1-amonoacid2-aspartate amphiphiles (Cn acid-AA1-AA2-D), which were potentially capable of self-assembling into hydrogels according to the structure and properties of each moiety. We then generated 14 novel conjugates based on this design by using two Fmoc/tBu solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques; we verified their structures and purities through liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Of them, 13 conjugates formed hydrogels at low concentrations (≥0.25% w/v), but C8 acid-ILD-NH2 showed the best hydrogelation and was investigated further. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that C8 acid-ILD-NH2 formed fibrous network structures and rapidly formed hydrogels that were stable in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 2-8, 37 °C), a typical pathophysiological condition. Injection and rheological studies revealed that the hydrogels manifested important wound treatment properties, including injectability, shear thinning, rapid re-gelation, and wound-compatible mechanics (e.g., moduli G″ and G', ~0.5-15 kPa). The C8 acid-ILD-NH2(2) hydrogel markedly accelerated the healing of third-degree burn wounds on C57BL/6J mice. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the potential of the Cn fatty acid-AA1-AA2-D molecular template to form hydrogels capable of promoting the wound healing of third-degree burns.",

      "abstract": "Mutations in the genes of tumor cells and the disorder of immune microenvironment are the main factors of tumor development. The sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy drugs affect the treatment of tumor. Nuclear transcription factor E4BP4 is dysregulated in a variety of malignant tumors. It can suppress the transcription of NFKBIA, RASSF8, SOSTDC1, FOXO-induced genes (TRAIL, FAS, GADD45a and GADD45b) and Hepcidin, up-regulate RCAN1-1 and PRNP, activate mTOR and p38 in cancer cells. Also, E4BP4 can regulate tumor immune microenvironment. TGFb1/Smad3/E4BP4/ IFNγ axis in NK cells plays an important role in antitumor immunotherapy. Over expression of E4BP4 inhibited the development of Th17 cells by directly binding to the RORγt promoter. Moreover, recent studies have shown that E4BP4 inhibited the expression of multidrug resistance genes. In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanism of E4BP4 in cancer cellular process, the effects of E4BP4 in cancer immunotherapy and antitumor drug resistance, to provide theoretical basis for tumor treatment strategies targeting E4BP4.",

      "abstract": "The feasibility of targeted imaging and therapy using radiolabeled albumin‑binding domain‑derived affinity proteins (ADAPTs) has been demonstrated. However, high renal uptake of radioactivity limits the maximum tolerated dose. Successful reduction of renal retention of radiolabeled Fab fragments has been demonstrated by incorporating a cleavable linker between the targeting agent and the radiometal chelator. The present study investigated if the introduction of a glycine‑leucine‑glycine‑lysine (GLGK)‑linker would reduce the kidney uptake of radiolabeled ADAPT6 and also compared it with the non‑residualizing [125I]I‑[(4‑hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]maleimide ([125I]I‑HPEM) labeling strategy. GLGK was site‑specifically coupled to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)‑targeting ADAPT6. Conjugates without the cleavable linker were used as controls and all constructs were labeled with lutetium‑177 (177Lu). [125I]I‑HPEM was coupled to ADAPT6 at the C‑terminus. Biodistribution of all constructs was evaluated in NMRI mice 4 h after injection. Specific binding to HER2‑expressing cells in vitro was demonstrated for all constructs. No significant difference in kidney uptake was observed between the [177Lu]Lu‑2,2',2\",2\"'‑(1,4,7,10‑tetraazacyclododecane‑1,4,7,10‑tetrayl)tetraacetic acid‑GLGK‑conjugates and the controls. The renal activity of [125I]I‑HPEM‑ADAPT6 was significantly lower compared with all other constructs. In conclusion, the incorporation of the cleavable GLGK‑linker did not result in lower renal retention. Therefore, the present study emphasized that, in order to achieve a reduction of renal retention, alternative molecular design strategies may be required for different targeting agents.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin is one of the most important antitumor drugs used in oncology; however, its cardiotoxic effect limits the therapeutic use and raises concerns regarding patient prognosis. Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid used in dietary supplementation and has been studied to attenuate the toxic effects of doxorubicin in animals, which increases oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in different organs can be estimated using several methods, including catalase expression analysis. This study aimed to analyze the effect of leucine on catalase levels in rat hearts after doxorubicin administration. Adult male Wistar rats were separated into two groups: Standard diet (SD) and 5% Leucine-Enriched Diet (LED). The animals had free access to diet from D0 to D28. At D14, the groups were subdivided in animals injected with Doxorubicin and animals injected with vehicle, until D28, and the groups were SD, SD + Dox, LED and LED + Dox. At D28, the animals were submitted do Transthoracic Echocardiography and euthanized. Despite Dox groups had impaired body weight gain, raw heart weight was not different between the groups. No substantial alterations were observed in macroscopic evaluation of the heart. Although, Doxorubicin treatment increased total interstitial collagen in the heart, which in addition to Type I collagen, is lower in LED groups. Western blot analysis showed that catalase expression in the heart of LED groups was lower than that in SD groups. In conclusion, leucine supplementation reduced both the precocious Dox-induced cardiac remodeling and catalase levels in the heart.",

LRRK2 is recruited to membrane organelles and activated by Rab29, a Rab guanosine triphosphatase encoded in the PARK16 locus. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of Rab29-LRRK2 complexes in three oligomeric states, providing key snapshots during LRRK2 recruitment and activation. Rab29 induces an unexpected tetrameric assembly of LRRK2, formed by two kinase-active central protomers and two kinase-inactive peripheral protomers. The central protomers resemble the active-like state trapped by the type I kinase inhibitor DNL201, a compound that underwent a phase 1 clinical trial. Our work reveals the structural mechanism of LRRK2 spatial regulation and provides insights into LRRK2 inhibitor design for Parkinson's disease treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG) is a potential biomarker for disease activity and reflects mucosal healing in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, only a few studies have described a detailed sensitivity analysis of LRG in predicting mucosal healing in patients. This study aimed to evaluate the association between LRG and the endoscopic activity of UC and its predictability for mucosal healing and explore the utility and clinical application of LRG. METHODS: The diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers, including LRG, in predicting the endoscopic activity of UC was evaluated. All consecutive patients who underwent total colonoscopy between April 2021 and September 2022 were included. The Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) was used for assessing endoscopic activity. Furthermore, endoscopic remission was defined as an MES of ≤1. Clinical activity was evaluated based on stool frequency and bloody stool. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and binary logistic regression were performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers. We evaluated LRG trends and treatment response in patients with MES ≥2 who underwent induction therapy. RESULTS: This study comprised 214 patients. The proportions of endoscopically and clinically active patients were 33.6% and 49.1%, respectively. LRG had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.856, with a higher diagnostic accuracy than other biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein, leukocyte, neutrophil, platelet, and albumin. The cutoff value for LRG was 15.6 μg/mL (sensitivity, 72.2%; specificity, 86.6%). Using the MES, patients with higher scores had higher LRG levels than those with lower scores. The cutoff value, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity varied with a higher AUC for left-sided colitis and pancolitis than for proctitis. Logistic regression analysis showed that LRG was an independent predictor of endoscopic remission using multivariate analysis, even with the factor of clinical activity. The change ratio of LRG pre- and post-treatment was statistically significant in the higher LRG group. CONCLUSION: LRG reflected endoscopic activity independently, regardless of clinical symptoms. An LRG below the cutoff value could indicate a significantly low probability of endoscopic activity in asymptomatic patients, and follow-up endoscopy (not for cancer screening) may be unnecessary. Furthermore, a higher LRG level might be more useful as an indicator of treatment efficacy."

Effects of L-leucine supplementation and resistance training on adipokine markers in untrained perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. J Strength Cond Res 38(3): 526-532, 2024-This study examined the effects of supplementing 5 g of leucine compared with a placebo during a 10-week resistance training program on body composition parameters and adipokine concentrations in untrained, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Thirty-five women were randomly assigned to 2 groups-leucine (LEU, n = 17) and placebo (PLC, n = 18)-in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Each group consumed the supplement or placebo every day and completed a resistance training program for 10 weeks. Using 3-day food records, a diet was assessed before the intervention and after its cessation. Body composition was assessed preintervention and postintervention using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Moreover, the concentrations of adipokines, such as adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), were assessed preintervention and postintervention. Both groups showed an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area ( p = 0.030) and fat-free mass (FFM; p = 0.023). There were significant group differences in concentrations of visfatin ( p = 0.020) and leptin ( p = 0.038) between the PLC and LEU groups. Visfatin displayed higher concentrations in the PLC group and leptin displayed higher concentrations in the LEU group. In addition, there were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations for both groups (LEU: 652 ± 513 to 292 ± 447 pg·ml -1 ; PLC: 584 ± 572 to 245 ± 356 pg·ml -1 , p = 0.002) and MCP-1 only decreased in the PLC group (253 ± 119 to 206 ± 106 pg·ml -1 , p = 0.004). There were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations in both groups and a decrease in MCP-1 concentrations in the PLC group. These decreases may be due to both adipokines possible relationship with VAT area. However, it is not known whether leucine has underlying properties that hinder changes in MCP-1 concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) cultured from periodontal ligament (PDL) tissue contain postnatal stem cells that can be differentiated into PDL fibroblasts. We obtained PDL fibroblasts from hPDLCs by treatment with low concentrations of TGF-β1. Since the extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules play an important role in differentiation, we had previously developed a series of monoclonal antibodies against PDL fibroblast-specific cell surface molecules. One of these, the anti-PDL51 antibody, recognized a protein that was significantly upregulated in TGF-β1-induced PDL fibroblasts and highly accumulated in the PDL region of the tooth root. Mass spectrometry revealed that the antigen recognized by the anti-PDL51 antibody was leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15), and this antibody specifically recognized the extracellular glycosylated moiety of LRRC15. Experiments presented here show that as fibroblastic differentiation progresses, increased amounts of LRRC15 localized at the cell surface and membrane. Inhibition of LRRC15 by siRNA-mediated depletion and by antibody blocking resulted in downregulation of the representative PDL fibroblastic markers. Moreover, following LRRC15 inhibition, the directed and elongated cell phenotypes disappeared, and the long processes of the end of the cell body were no longer found. Through a specific interaction between integrin β1 and LRRC15, the focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway was activated in PDL fibroblasts. Furthermore, it was shown that increased LRRC15 was important for the activation of the integrin-mediated cell adhesion signal pathway for regulation of cellular functions, including fibroblastic differentiation, proliferation, and cell migration arising from the expression of PDL-related genes in TGF-β1-induced PDL fibroblastic differentiation.",

      "abstract": "Pleckstrin homology domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) is an emerging player in diverse disorders. Our previous findings have documented that reducing PHLPP2 levels in cultured retinal ganglion cells protects against cellular damage caused by high glucose, indicating a possible link between PHLPP2 and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The present work was dedicated to the investigation of PHLPP2 in DR through in vivo experiments with rat models induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Compared to normal rats, the retinas of rats with DR exhibited a notable increase in the level of PHLPP2. The reduction of PHLPP2 levels in the retina was achieved by the intravitreal administration of adeno-associated viruses expressing specific shRNA targeting PHLPP2. Decreasing the expression of PHLPP2 ameliorated visual function impairment and improved the pathological changes of retina in DR rats. Moreover, decreasing the expression of PHLPP2 repressed the apoptosis, oxidative stress and proinflammatory response in the retinas of rats with DR. Reduction of PHLPP2 levels led to an increase in the levels of phosphorylated AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Decreasing the expression of PHLPP2 resulted in increased activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which was reversed by suppressing AKT. Notably, the protective effect of reducing PHLPP2 on DR was eliminated when Nrf2 was restrained. These observations show that the down-regulation of PHLPP2 has protective effects on DR by preserving the structure and function of the retina by regulating the AKT-GSK-3β-Nrf2 signal cascade. Therefore, targeting PHLPP2 may hold promise in the treatment of DR.",

Nutraceutical treatments have been proposed as a potential treatment strategy to mitigate cachexia-induced muscle wasting. However, contradictory findings warrant further investigation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of leucine supplementation on skeletal muscle in male and female ApcMin/+ mice (APC). APC mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were given normal drinking water or 1.5% leucine-supplemented water (n = 4-10/group/sex). We measured the gene expression of regulators of inflammation, protein balance, and myogenesis. Leucine treatment lowered survival rates, body mass, and muscle mass in males, while in females, it had no effect on body or muscle mass. Leucine treatment altered inflammatory gene expression by lowering Il1b 87% in the APC group and decreasing Tnfa 92% in both WT and APC males, while it had no effect in females (p < 0.05). Leucine had no effect on regulators of protein balance and myogenesis in either sex. We demonstrated that leucine exacerbates moribundity in males and is not sufficient for mitigating muscle or fat loss during CC in either sex in the ApcMin/+ mouse.",

      "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex syndrome associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Leucine supplementation has been demonstrated to attenuate cardiac dysfunction in animal models of cachexia and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). So far, no data exist on leucine supplementation on cardiac function in HFpEF. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the effect of leucine supplementation on myocardial function and key signaling pathways in an established HFpEF rat model. Female ZSF1 rats were randomized into three groups: Control (untreated lean rats), HFpEF (untreated obese rats), and HFpEF_Leu (obese rats receiving standard chow enriched with 3% leucine). Leucine supplementation started at 20 weeks of age after an established HFpEF was confirmed in obese rats. In all animals, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography at baseline and throughout the experiment. At the age of 32 weeks, hemodynamics were measured invasively, and myocardial tissue was collected for assessment of mitochondrial function and for histological and molecular analyses. Leucine had already improved diastolic function after 4 weeks of treatment. This was accompanied by improved hemodynamics and reduced stiffness, as well as by reduced left ventricular fibrosis and hypertrophy. Cardiac mitochondrial respiratory function was improved by leucine without alteration of the cardiac mitochondrial content. Lastly, leucine supplementation suppressed the expression and nuclear localization of HDAC4 and was associated with Protein kinase A activation. Our data show that leucine supplementation improves diastolic function and decreases remodeling processes in a rat model of HFpEF. Beneficial effects were associated with HDAC4/TGF-β1/Collagenase downregulation and indicate a potential use in the treatment of HFpEF.",

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether Leu supplementation during energy restriction blunted the loss of FFM, enhanced the loss of fat mass (FM) and improved glucose tolerance. DESIGN: Thirty-seven adults, aged 20-65 years, with increased waist circumference and at least one other metabolic syndrome (MetS) component, were selected. We employed a two-arm parallel, double blind, randomized control trial (RCT) design. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (leucine - 3 g/d) or placebo (lactose - 2.67 g/d), while following an individualised energy restricted diet for an 8-week period. Detailed body composition (DEXA), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin and components of MetS were measured before and after the trial. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) assessed the effect of Leu on an intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Bootstrapping method with 1000 bootstrap samples was used to derive parameter estimates, standard errors, p-values, and 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes. RESULTS: Adjusted for baseline values and other covariates, FFM (p = 0.045) and lean tissue mass (LTM) (p = 0.050) were significantly higher following Leu. These outcomes were modified by a significant treatment x sex interaction that indicated Leu had the greater effect in men. However, on adjustment for body composition changes, there was no difference in insulin sensitivity, oral glucose tolerance, or change in MetS components following Leu. CONCLUSION: Short-term leucine supplementation during energy restriction resulted in a greater preservation of FFM and LTM particularly in men, but did not impact glucose metabolism.",

      "abstract": "A disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a crucial pathophysiological change that can impact the outcome of a stroke. Ribosomal protein S6 (S6) and protein kinase B (Akt) play significant roles in early cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Studies have suggested that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) may have neuroprotective properties for spinal cord or brain injuries. Therefore, we conducted research to investigate if leucine, one of the BCAAs, could offer neuroprotection and alter BBB disruption, along with its effects on the phosphorylation of S6 and Akt during the early phase of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, specifically within the thrombolytic therapy time window. In rats, ten min after left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), 5 µL of 20 mM L-leucine or normal saline was injected into the left lateral ventricle. After two hours of reperfusion following one hour of MCAO, we determined the transfer coefficient (Ki) of 14C-α-aminoisobutyric acid to assess the BBB disruption, infarct size, and phosphorylation of S6 and Akt. Ischemia-reperfusion increased the Ki (+143%, p < 0.001) and the intra-cerebroventricular injection of leucine lowered the Ki in the ischemic-reperfused cortex (-34%, p < 0.001). Leucine reduced the percentage of cortical infarct (-42%, p < 0.0001) out of the total cortical area. Ischemia-reperfusion alone significantly increased the phosphorylation of both S6 and Akt (p < 0.05). However, the administration of leucine had no further effect on the phosphorylation of S6 or Akt in the ischemic-reperfused cortex. This study suggests that an acute increase in leucine levels in the brain during early ischemia-reperfusion within a few hours of stroke may offer neuroprotection, possibly due to reduced BBB disruption being one of the major contributing factors. Leucine did not further increase the already elevated phosphorylation of S6 or Akt by ischemia-reperfusion under the current experimental conditions. Our data warrant further studies on the effects of leucine on neuronal survival and its mechanisms in the later stages of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion."

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia and frailty are important conditions that become increasingly prevalent with age. There is partial overlap between the two conditions, especially in terms of the physical aspects of the frailty phenotype: low grip strength, gait speed, and muscle mass. This study examined whether administration of the essential branched-chain amino acid leucine, besides improving sarcopenia, may reduce frailty assessed by frailty index (FI) in older institutionalized people living in nursing homes. We conducted a secondary analysis of a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind design study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03831399). The study included fifty males and females aged 65 and over who were living in nursing homes and did not have dementia. The participants were randomized to a parallel group intervention of 13 weeks' duration, with a daily intake of leucine (6 g/day) or placebo (lactose, 6 g/day). The outcome of this study was to evaluate whether there was a change in the level of a 95 item FI compared to the baseline and to compare the effect of the leucine group versus the placebo group. A significant inverse correlation was found between FI and performance of the activities of daily life, cognitive function, gait and balance, muscle function parameters, and nutritional status (p < 0.001 in all cases). There were no statistically significant differences in FI levels at baseline (placebo group FI 0.27 ± 0.08 and leucine group FI 0.27 ± 0.10) and at the 13 week follow-up (placebo group FI 0.28 ± 0.10 and leucine group FI 0.28 ± 0.09). There were also no significant differences between the leucine and placebo groups in the mean FI difference between baseline and follow-up (p = 0.316, Cohen's d: 0.04). This pilot study showed that a nutritional supplementation with leucine did not significantly modify the frailty index in older nursing home residents."
