      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is a complex neurological phenomenon that is actually very common. AMI can appear following a knee injury or knee surgery. If it is not addressed, the patient's function can be negatively affected. There is currently no specific tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI. INDICATIONS: Following surgery or injury to the knee, AMI causes defective activation of the quadriceps, sometimes combined with a knee extension deficit. A clinical classification of AMI has been proposed recently to help with making the diagnosis and to guide treatment. In this article, we describe how biofeedback and surface electromyography (EMG) can be used in the early diagnosis and treatment of knee AMI. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION: Biofeedback is based on transformation of physiological variables into a visual or auditory signal. This allows the patient to learn how to control physical and bodily functions, which were previously considered as involuntary processes. This technique requires the use of a specific device that transforms the measured physiological signals-neuromuscular activation in this instance-into visual signals. This tool incorporates surface EMG, with electrodes connected to a measuring unit. This unit is connected to a screen that shows the neuromuscular activation in real time. Thus, EMG biofeedback can be used to help clinicians make a diagnosis and to specifically treat the AMI. RESULTS: We have used biofeedback in patients who have a knee injury or who have undergone knee surgery. Both the therapist and patient were able to objectively see the presence of AMI using the biofeedback device. For treatment, the therapist works with a patient by providing clear instructions and increasingly more challenging goals. We show examples of how patients were able to eliminate their AMI by using biofeedback. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: EMG biofeedback is a promising tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and ACL reconstruction surgery. The next steps are to define thresholds and a rehabilitation protocol that will be used in a clinical trial.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are increasingly recognized as products of the brain-gut axis associated with dysfunctions of the chronic stress response systems. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a virtual, group-based heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback-enhanced coping skills intervention for youth with IBD. Treatment targets included symptoms of anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and perceived stress. METHODS: Youth with IBD (ages 13-18) and their caregivers were randomized to either immediate treatment or waitlist control groups. The intervention consisted of 6 virtually delivered, weekly group sessions combining cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with HRV biofeedback training. Outcomes included measures of anxiety, depression, GI symptoms, perceived stress, and HRV parameters. Assessments were conducted at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Of the 53 youth randomized, 50 participated in their assigned group. The intervention demonstrated strong feasibility with 84% of participants attending at least 4 of 6 sessions. Both adolescents and parents reported strong satisfaction. Following treatment, parents reported significant decreases in adolescent depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and GI symptoms compared to controls. Adolescents reported reductions in GI symptoms and perceived stress compared to controls and reductions in symptoms of anxiety within the treatment group. No changes were observed in HRV parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study supports the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual, group-based HRV biofeedback-enhanced coping skills intervention for youth with IBD. Preliminary efficacy was demonstrated for reducing psychological and physical symptoms. Future research should evaluate efficacy in a larger, more diverse sample with elevated baseline psychological symptoms."

      "abstract": "This paper discusses both the 'why' and the 'how' concerning a multi-modal approach to enhancing treatment outcomes with a variety of clients. First, the necessity of an approach to client care that combines treatment modalities will be discussed. Then comes discussion of the history of combining modalities along with discussion of which combinations of treatments should be considered for different disorders. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), for example, requires more than one intervention because its neurological basis means it is appropriate for the brain-based intervention of neurofeedback and its comorbidities require other interventions, such as biofeedback for improved emotional regulation if there is anxiety and/or depression, and coaching in learning strategies (metacognition) to help with academic delays and/or learning disabilities. The triad of neurofeedback, biofeedback (especially heart rate variability training) and metacognitive strategies will produce improvements in most clients, regardless of their disorder. Additionally, it can also be used with athletes and executives to optimize performance. For complex cases, further interventions can be added. Medication might be needed as part of multi-modal management in ADHD or in depression or a seizure disorder. The dose can be tapered and, usually, eliminated, once the neurofeedback training produces a reduction in symptoms. Strategies can cover a wide range of approaches that are based on clients' needs and presenting problems; for example, psychotherapy to deal with emotional issues. The final section of the paper shares clinical examples of how treatments can be combined and mentions adding newer interventions, as appropriate, including listening therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and photobiomodulation (PBM)."

      "abstract": "Aging is associated with declines in autonomic nervous system (ANS) function, including reduced heart rate variability (HRV), impaired neurovascular coupling, and diminished cerebrovascular responsiveness-factors that may contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding how aging alters physiological signal integration in the brain is crucial for identifying potential interventions to promote brain health. This study examines age-related differences in how cardiac and respiratory fluctuations influence the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, using two independent resting-state fMRI datasets with concurrent physiological recordings from younger and older adults. Our findings reveal significant age-related reductions in the percent variance of the BOLD signal explained by heart rate (HR), respiratory variation (RV), and end-tidal CO 2 , particularly in regions involved in autonomic regulation, including the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, basal ganglia, and white matter. Cross-correlation analysis also revealed that younger adults exhibited stronger HR-BOLD coupling in white matter, as well as a more rapid BOLD response to RV and CO 2 in gray matter. Additionally, we investigated the effects of heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) training, a non-invasive intervention designed to modulate heart rate oscillations. The intervention altered physiological-BOLD coupling in an age- and training-dependent manner: older adults who underwent HRV-BF to enhance HR oscillations exhibited a shift toward younger-like HR-BOLD coupling patterns, while younger adults who trained to suppress HR oscillations showed increased CO 2 -BOLD coupling. These findings suggest that HRV-BF may help mitigate age-related declines in autonomic or cerebrovascular function. Overall, this study underscores the role of physiological dynamics in brain aging and highlights the importance of considering autonomic function when interpreting BOLD signals. By demonstrating that HRV-BF can modulate physiological-BOLD interactions, our findings suggest a potential pathway for enhancing cerebrovascular function and preserving brain health across the lifespan."

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Neurofeedback (NFB) and biofeedback (BFB) have been shown to reduce stress, enhance physiological self-regulation, improve cognitive performance, and accelerate response times. Stimulating the sensorimotor rhythm (12-15 Hz) is particularly effective in improving working memory and selective attention. However, most studies on air force pilots focus on addressing post-traumatic stress disorder rather than investigating how these interventions might enhance performance and safety during flights, as explored in the present study. (2) Methods: Twelve Spanish Air Force fighter pilot trainees (mean age = 22.83 (0.94) years) participated in the study. Six pilots underwent 24 sessions of combined NFB and BFB training (experimental group), while six served as controls. (3) Results: The experimental group demonstrated improved heart rate variability during baseline, alarm sounds, math tasks, and real flights, which is indicative of greater parasympathetic modulation. A significant decrease in the Theta/SMR ratio was observed in the experimental group during the same conditions, suggesting improved focus, with lower values than the control group. Cognitive performance improved in the experimental group, with higher accuracy and a greater number of completed operations during math tasks. Regarding dual-task performance, the experimental group showed lower reaction time and a better ratio taps/reaction post-intervention. Psychological benefits included reduced cognitive, somatic, and state anxiety levels, along with increased self-confidence. (4) Conclusions: Neurofeedback and biofeedback training, integrated with real flights, simulators, and virtual reality, can enhance physiological regulation, cognitive performance, and emotional resilience, contributing to improved performance and safety in air force pilots.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has forced numerous migrants into neighboring countries, many suffering from pre-existing or newly acquired physical and mental health conditions. Addressing these complex challenges in humanitarian settings requires innovative, evidence-based interventions that are cost-effective and easy to administer. Drawing upon research highlighting the vagus nerve's role in regulating well-being, we hypothesized that vagal nerve activation could offer a promising therapeutic approach. METHOD: We conducted a proof-of-concept study in which 21 Ukrainian forced migrants were trained in a biofeedback-guided paced breathing intervention designed to stimulate the vagus nerve and promote self-regulation of stress response systems. Changes in pain perception, perceived stress, blood pressure, and heart rate were assessed before and after the vagal breathing intervention using a t-test. Correlations were examined at baseline. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were observed in all measures except systolic blood pressure, providing preliminary evidence for the efficacy of vagal nerve activation in alleviating stress-related health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility and therapeutic potential of a vagal nerve-activating intervention in a humanitarian setting. These findings warrant replication in larger, controlled trials. If substantiated, this low-cost, scalable intervention could help mitigate health burdens among forced migrant populations worldwide.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A high number of individuals report suffering from physical and psychological sequelae symptoms after COVID-19-the so-called post COVID-19 condition. Commonly reported complaints include physical symptoms such as fatigue, headache, attention and concentration deficits or dyspnea and anxiety, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, or depression. Evidence-based treatment recommendations are still lacking up to this point. Associations between physical and psychological symptoms in chronic diseases are known for a long time. Support in coping with the disease and improvement of self-efficacy can have a positive effect on the course of diseases. For this reason, we designed a randomized, controlled explorative intervention trial as a treatment of bodily distress disorder in COVID-19 recovered persons. METHODS: Patients with a post COVID-19 condition meeting to the criteria of the WHO, along with a bodily distress disorder, are randomized in an intervention and control arm (TAU). Randomization takes place after a diagnostic interview, screening, and informed consent. In total, 60 patients will be included in the trial (30 per group). The intervention group receives a cognitive behavioral therapy as a video-conference-based group therapy (6 weeks) and mobile, respiratory biofeedback treatment (for 4 weeks). At several time points, both groups are assessed in terms of psychological and physical health status, treatment expectation, and satisfaction with the intervention. Furthermore, they will get biofeedback examination appointments. The primary outcome is the change in self-efficacy; secondary outcomes include assessed parameters of mental health, somatic symptoms, and satisfaction with the intervention. Data will be analyzed primarily using R and SPSS. DISCUSSION: The randomized, controlled, explorative intervention trial POSITIV is one of the very first interventions for patients with post COVID-19 condition and psychological burden due to their different symptoms. The aim of the study is to generate new evidence and help patients to cope with the disease and thus, increase their quality of life and reduce symptomatology. We expect with a high probability that the patients' self-efficacy and health status will improve as a result of the intervention.

This study aims to compare the efficacy of bilateral percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (Bi-PTNS) to biofeedback therapy (BFT) in adult patients with ODS. Methods A prospective randomised control study was conducted on patients aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with ODS, who were referred to the Colorectal Surgery Department at a main university hospital between 2018 and 2020. Computerized 1:1 block randomization allocated patients into two groups: the bi-PTNS group and the BFT group. The Constipation Scoring System and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Score (PAC-QoL) were used to assess the severity of the patient's symptoms prior to and after treatment. The primary outcome was the improvement of the Constipation Scoring System. The secondary outcome was the PAC-QoL score. Results In total, 60 patients, with 38 females (mean of 43 years in the BFT group and 48 years in the Bi-PTNS group), were studied. Statistically significant differences were achieved in patients who underwent bi-PTNS compared to the BFT group (p < 0.001). The average improvement in the Constipation Scoring System score for the bi-PTNS group was 66.66% ± 8.44 compared to 47.36% ± 10.44 for the BFT group. The bi-PTNS group showed improvement in the PAC-QoL score (60.41% ± 4.03) compared with 42.59% ±6.25 in the BFT group. Conclusion The Bi-PTNS intervention was more effective than BFT in alleviating symptoms of OD compared to BFT, evidenced by improvements in both the Constipation Scoring System and PAC-QoL scores."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A large body of scientific work has been focused on reducing the high incidence rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in young female compared to male soccer players. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a randomized clinical trial to reduce a risk factor of ACL injuries, knee abduction moment (KAM), with neuromuscular training and biomechanical biofeedback in adolescent female athletes. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, active comparator, open blinded, end-point trial was conducted with 150 (age: 13.3 ± 2.2 yrs, height: 156.1 ± 1 0.6 cm, mass: 50.2 ± 11.3 kg) female soccer players. Each participant received neuromuscular training and randomized into one of three arms: 1) an active control, considered sham biofeedback (NMT), 2) a knee-focused biofeedback group (NMT + K), and 3) a hip-focused biofeedback group (NMT + H). The participants completed two assessments: a baseline session prior to the intervention and a post-intervention session. The primary outcome measure was change knee abduction moment during a double leg drop vertical jump (DVJ). Additionally, an unplanned single leg cutting task was also recorded. As an exploratory outcome measure, athletic exposures and ACL injuries were recorded weekly for six months following the post-test session. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in KAM, during the DVJ, was found in all three intervention groups from baseline to the post-test (p < 0.05). However, statistically significant improvements in KAM during cutting was only observed in the NMT + H intervention group (p < 0.05). ACL injuries were not reported in any intervention group during the six months of follow up. CONCLUSIONS: While female soccer players involved in neuromuscular training programs regardless of intervention group exhibit significant improvements in KAM during a double leg landing, those that engage in hip-focused biofeedback compared to knee-focused or sham biofeedback exhibit decreased KAM during an unanticipated cutting maneuver. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Institutional Review Board at High Point University approved the study protocol. The clinical trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02754700) on 28/04/2016..",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic pain in adolescents is a significant and growing concern, as it can have negative implications on physical and psychosocial development. Management can be complicated by the increasing risks associated with opioid misuse, highlighting the need for effective nonpharmacological interventions. Biofeedback is an empirically supported behavioral intervention for chronic pain that targets the self-regulation of physiological responses. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel delivery method for biofeedback that could serve as an engaging and effective platform for adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of integrating a VR-delivered respiratory biofeedback intervention into an outpatient pediatric pain rehabilitation program (PPRP) for adolescents with chronic pain. METHODS: In this pilot study, we recruited 9 participants from those enrolled in the PPRP at Nemours Children's Hospital. Participants underwent 2 VR respiratory biofeedback sessions per week over a 4-week period using AppliedVR's \"RelieVRx\" program. Feasibility was defined as >60% of eligible patients enrolling with at least 80% of VR sessions completed. Acceptability was assessed via validated acceptability questionnaires, with high acceptability defined as an average acceptability rating score >3 on a 5-point Likert scale. Open-ended responses were analyzed via qualitative analysis. Preliminary effectiveness was assessed with questionnaires measuring the quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL]) and level of pain interference in daily activities (Functional Disability Inventory) before and after participation in the pain program. Finally, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were measured before and after each VR session. RESULTS: Of 14 eligible PPRP patients, 9 (64%) enrolled in the VR respiratory biofeedback study, and 7 (77% of study participants) completed at least 80% of biofeedback sessions. Participants reported high acceptability with average session ratings ranging from 3.89 to 4.16 on post-VR program questionnaires. Of 224 open-ended responses, participants reported changes in stress and somatic symptoms (ie, pain distraction and breathing regulation). There was a statistically significant increase in the average physical functioning score of the PedsQL among participants (P=.01) from pre- to postparticipation in the overall pain program. The cohort's average emotional functioning score of the PedsQL also increased, though this change was not statistically significant (P=.17). Participants' Functional Disability Inventory scores significantly decreased from an average of 25.1 to 11 from before to after the pain program (P=.002). There were no significant differences between pre- versus post-BP or HR for any session. However, decreased BP and HR were observed across most sessions. CONCLUSIONS: AppliedVR respiratory biofeedback demonstrated initial feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness when implemented as part of a PRPP. This study underscores the need for future larger-scale studies analyzing the use of VR biofeedback in adolescent populations with chronic pain."

This study reports on cleft-specialist speech and language therapists' (SLTs) views on the acceptability of the technique in clinical practice and on their readiness to contribute to future clinical trials of its effectiveness.DesignA qualitative design comprising semi-structured focus groups/interviews.SettingClinicians reflected on how easy it would be to use ultrasound in their regional cleft services.ParticipantsClinicians were recruited via invitation to a UK-wide list of cleft-specialist SLTs. Eleven participants took part over 2 focus groups and 2 interviews.AnalysisFocus groups/interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and an inductive thematic analysis was undertaken. Once complete, a deductive analysis using the theoretical framework of acceptability was conducted to summarise the findings.ResultsFour themes emerged: (1) value of ultrasound as an approach; (2) intrinsic drawbacks of acquiring and utilising ultrasound; (3) competence in effective performance within a clinical trial; and (4) incentives for clinicians and patients in participation in research.ConclusionsParticipants were positive about the benefits of ultrasound for visualising the articulators and improving patient outcomes. Barriers to adoption included the cost of the equipment and the time to travel to appointments. Across clinical and research uses of ultrasound the need for high-quality training and networking within a community of practice was highlighted."

Interventions to improve ankle function could help maintain gait performance in old adults. Inertial measurement units are practical and inexpensive and may be used to provide biofeedback of foot angular velocity to improve ankle propulsive function during gait. PURPOSE: This study assessed if real-time biofeedback of foot plantarflexion angular velocity influenced ankle kinetics and hip-to-ankle work ratio in old adults. METHODS: Eight healthy old adults walked at their preferred speed (PS), maximal speed (MS), and MS with auditory feedback for a 5 % increase in foot plantarflexion velocity (AUD). Kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected, and joint kinetics were calculated. RESULTS: Ankle positive work was larger during MS (p < 0.001) and AUD (p < 0.001) compared to PS, and 8 % larger during AUD compared to MS (p = 0.01). Hip-to-ankle work ratio was not different during MS (p = 0.053) compared to PS but AUD reduced the ratio by 7 % compared to MS (p = 0.03) and by 19 % compared to PS (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that biofeedback of foot plantarflexion velocity may be an effective strategy to acutely increase ankle positive work and reduce hip-to-ankle work ratio during treadmill walking in old adults."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diaphragmatic flutter (DF) is a rare condition characterized by involuntary contractions of the diaphragmatic muscle, often accompanied by accessory respiratory muscle contractions. Symptoms can include epigastric pulsations, abdominal pain, and reflux. Diagnosis is challenging, and treatment is based on individual cases. This study presents the first case series of DF assessed using high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM), electromyography (EMG), and plethysmography belts, and the symptomatic improvement through biofeedback therapy. METHODS: This case series includes patients with refractory abdominal spasms referred to the digestive motility department from 2018 to 2024. RESULTS: Two patients were diagnosed with DF using HREM, which reveals a characteristic pattern of oscillating increases in intragastric pressure, repetitive crural diaphragm spasms, and pharyngeal contraction during abdominal spasms. Symptomatic control was achieved following abdomino-thoracic biofeedback (ATB) therapy by plethysmography belts. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution esophageal manometry offers a reliable, non-invasive method for diagnosis of DF, presenting a specific manometric pattern. ATB appears to be an effective treatment for DF, suggesting that voluntary but unconsciously initiated movement disorders may contribute to the condition."

Occupational therapy practitioners are uniquely able to provide individualized care to address this, which may include external pelvic floor biofeedback. OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation of external pelvic floor biofeedback for bladder management within the context of toileting for children with neurogenic bladder dysfunction following incomplete spinal cord injury. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation unit within a pediatric hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three children with incomplete spinal cord injury were enrolled. INTERVENTION: External pelvic floor biofeedback. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The study used the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM®), Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) Daily Activities Short Form, Pediatric Spinal Cord Injury Activity Measures (PEDI-SCI AM) Short Forms, and voiding characteristics. RESULTS: No adverse events occurred. Following biofeedback, all children improved their AM-PAC toileting scores, and PEDI-SCI AM scores improved for 2 of 3 children, whereas daily catheterization requirements decreased for all children. The WeeFIM did not detect changes in bladder management for 2 of 3 children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case report described how occupational therapy practitioners used external pelvic floor biofeedback as an adjunct conservative treatment strategy when providing care for pediatric children with recent incomplete spinal cord injury. Plain-Language Summary: Neurogenic bladder dysfunction following incomplete spinal cord injury can negatively affect a child's quality of life and social participation. Occupational therapy practitioners are uniquely able to address bladder management within the context of toileting for children with acquired incomplete spinal cord injury. A multimodal approach, which includes biofeedback, may improve the child's level of independence with toileting.",

Reducing stress is important because experiencing prolonged and elevated stress can have detrimental effects on mental and physical health and it is associated with aggressive behaviour and self-harm. AIMS: This preliminary study investigated whether an intervention combining biofeedback with listening to music is effective and whether a personalized music playlist is more effective than self-selected music in reducing physiological and subjective stress in participants with mild intellectual disabilities. METHODS: We collected 103 music listening sessions over a period of 2-4 weeks for 11 participants throughout their daily routines. They listened to music when they received biofeedback on their increased stress level (as measured by wearable biosensor Nowatch) or when they themselves felt stressed. Participants listened either to self-selected music or to a personalised playlist compiled with X-system, music technology that predicts the effect of a song on levels of autonomic arousal. Pulse rate (PR) and skin conductance level (SCL) were measured with the EmbracePlus and subjective feelings of stress and mood were measured with two scale questions. After the intervention phase, participants and their caregivers completed a short questionnaire to evaluate their experiences with using the X-system playlist. RESULTS: Mixed regression analyses showed reductions in PR and SCL during listening to music, and indications were found for reductions in subjective stress and improvement of mood after intervention. Listening to music compiled with X-system was not more effective than listening to self-selected music. However, lower combined arousal values (a feature of X-system) from self-selected and X-system music predicted lower PR and SCL, indicating that these indices can be used to select songs that have a relaxing or energizing effect. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The present study suggests that music listening is associated with both subjective and physiological stress reduction. Listening to music might be an accessible, inexpensive and empowering strategy for stress reduction and improving emotion regulation, which could also benefit mental and physical health. Several challenges were encountered while implementing the intervention and suggestions for future research are given."

Effective non-pharmacological solutions to address these are currently lacking. METHODS: Our three-armed longitudinal randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of a 4-week remote smartphone-based heart rate variability biofeedback intervention which involved daily paced breathing at 6 breaths p/min; active (12 breaths p/min) and waitlist controls were included. Heart rate variability and self-reported cancer-related symptoms were assessed at baseline, post-, and 6 months-post intervention. Participants were 60 UK-based women with primary breast cancer history (6 to 60 months post-active treatment). RESULTS: The intervention group showed significant increases in low-frequency heart rate variability over time (F (4, 103.89) = 2.862, p = 0.027, d = 0.33), long-lasting improvement in sleep quality (F (4, 88.04) = 4.87, p = 0.001, d = 0.43) and cessations in night sweats (X2 (2, N = 59) = 6.44, p = 0.04, Cramer's V = 0.33), and reduced anxiety post-intervention compared to the active and waitlist controls (F (4, 82.51) = 2.99, p = 0.023, d = 0.44). Other findings indicated that the intervention and active control participants reported lasting improvements in cognitive function, fatigue, and stress-related symptoms (all ps < 0.05). The waitlist group reported no symptom changes across time. CONCLUSION: Heart rate variability biofeedback is a feasible intervention for addressing diverse chronic symptoms commonly reported by breast cancer survivors.",

Atomoxetine (ATX) hydrochloride (HCI) has been widely used in clinical practice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback, as a nonpharmacological treatment approach, has also demonstrated potential in improving symptoms in children with ADHD. We aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of combining ATX HCI with EEG biofeedback in the treatment of ADHD in children. We hypothesized that this combined therapy would be more effective in alleviating symptoms in children with ADHD. Ninety children with ADHD were randomly separated into the control group (receiving ATX HCI treatment for 12 weeks) and study group (receiving ATX HCI treatment for 12 weeks combined with 60 sessions of EEG biofeedback treatment; n = 45). Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV) rating scale scores, integrated visual and auditory continuous performance test results, Conners parent symptom questionnaire (PSQ) scores, and adverse reactions were counted. After 12 weeks of treatment, SNAP-IV scores were lower in both groups and were much lower in the study group; full-scale attention quotient and full-scale response control quotient scores were elevated in both groups and were much higher in the study group; PSQ scores were lower in both groups and were much lower in the study group (all p < 0.05). During the treatment period, there was no difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between both groups (p > 0.05). The treatment combination of ATX HCI and EEG biofeedback is effective for children with ADHD, improving their behavioral issues and psychological conditions.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Children with leukemia and their caregivers have negative experiences such as pain, fear, and sleep disturbances when receiving invasive procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a biofeedback intervention on negative emotions and sleep quality for children with leukemia receiving invasive procedures and their caregivers. METHODS: A randomized controlled study involving 80 child-caregiver dyads was conducted, and dyads were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 40) and control (n = 40) groups. Both groups received health education, while the intervention group additionally received a 4-unit biofeedback intervention. Outcome measures compared at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 4-week follow-up (T2), included validated measures of pain, fear, worry, sleep quality in children, and anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in caregivers. RESULTS: At T1 and T2, the scores of children's pain and fear in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group (all p < 0.05). The significant group effects on children's pain (F = 6.064, p = 0.015) and fear (F = 15.532, p < 0.001) indicated that the intervention group had significantly lower scores in pain and fear compared to the control group. At T1 and T2, caregivers in the intervention group had significantly lower anxiety scores and significantly higher sleep quality than those in the control group (all p < 0.05). The significant group effects on anxiety (F = 10.124, p = 0.002) and sleep quality (F = 5.983, p = 0.015) suggested that the intervention group had significantly lower scores in anxiety and higher sleep quality in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The biofeedback intervention demonstrated significant efficacy in alleviating the pain, and fear experienced by children with leukemia during invasive procedures, concurrently relieving their caregivers' anxiety and improving sleep quality. This research furnishes compelling evidence substantiating the effectiveness of biofeedback interventions in alleviating negative emotions in children with leukemia undergoing invasive treatments, as well as in their caregivers.

All participants underwent vocal exercises associated with VR and RAS interventions. The first intervention was randomly assigned, and the second was conducted after 7 days. Speech tasks were recorded before and after interventions. The study analyzed the acoustic voice parameters from these recordings, assessed the participants' satisfaction after VR and RAS, and surveyed their preference between these strategies. RESULTS: The jitter, shimmer, and vocal irregularity parameters of the individuals with PD improved after the vocal technique associated with RAS. No improvements in these parameters were observed with VR. The comparison between RAS and VR results showed a reduction in shimmer with RAS. Participants reported a significant preference for VR rather than RAS in combination with vocal exercises. CONCLUSION: The vocal technique associated with RAS applied to individuals with PD improved vocal parameters related to sound wave perturbation. The study population preferred VR to RAS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) constitutes the primary subtype of renal cell carcinoma, representing 75% to 80% of cases and carrying a substantial cancer-specific mortality rate of up to 24%. Despite advancements in treatment options, KIRC displays notable resistance to conventional therapies, emphasizing the need for innovative targeted immunotherapeutic strategies. Chromatin regulators (CRs), pivotal proteins controlling gene expression and critical biological processes, play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of KIRC. This study employed a multi-omics approach to evaluate the impact of CR-associated genes on KIRC prognosis. METHODS: The study utilized the TCGA-KIRC dataset and employed LASSO Cox regression to construct and validate a prognostic model that focuses on genes influencing KIRC prognosis. The research investigated interactions among gene characteristics, clinical parameters, the tumor microenvironment, targeted immunotherapy, and drug responsiveness. Experimental validation, encompassing various techniques such as cell culture, transient transfection, qPCR, Transwell assays, confirmed the robust predictive capability of the BRD9 gene. RESULTS: The analysis identified the risk score of CRs as an independent factor determining KIRC prognosis. Furthermore, the study introduced a predictive Nomogram model that integrates clinical attributes and risk assessment. Significantly, BRD9 exhibited substantially elevated expression within KIRC cells, underscoring its role in driving cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. These findings suggest the potential for tailored immunotherapy targeting BRD9 in the treatment of KIRC. CONCLUSION: This study presents an innovative prognostic framework for KIRC based on multi-omics approaches, seamlessly incorporating CRs. This model holds promise for improving the accuracy of prognosis prediction for KIRC patients, laying a robust foundation for the development of targeted immunotherapies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pelvic floor muscles training (PFMT), with or without biofeedback (BF), is widely utilized as an alternative treatment for various refractory lower urinary tract dysfunctions in adults and children. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of PFMT alone versus in combination with BF on functional urinary incontinence (UI) in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of children who had undergone pelvic floor rehabilitation for non-neuropathic intermittent UI from 2018 to 2022 were retrieved. Patients were categorized based on their treatment regimen. Group I had undergone standard urotherapy and PFMT, twice weekly for 5 weeks. Group II had undergone a similar 5-week treatment with addition of 10 BF sessions conducted at the end of each appointment. All children had been evaluated with kidney and bladder ultrasounds, uroflowmetry/EMG, and a 7-day voiding and bowel diary before and after treatment. Response to treatment was defined according to International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) protocols. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients (71.9% female) with a mean age of 8.4 ± 2.1 (range: 5-13) years were included in the analyses (each group N = 16). In group I, nine (56.2%) and two (12.5%) patients demonstrated complete (100% reduction in UI episodes) and partial (50%-100% reduction in UI episodes) clinical response, respectively. In group II, 11 (68.7%) and 3 (18.8%) patients showed complete and partial response, respectively. The two groups were not significantly different with regard to clinical response (p = 0.430). No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of enuresis, urgency, constipation, and uroflowmetry parameters. CONCLUSIONS: PFMT under the supervision of an expert physical therapist appears to be as effective as combined PFMT and BF in improving UI in children without underlying neurologic disease.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the effects of high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) and quadriceps muscle strengthening exercises using biofeedback on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHODS: This randomized, two-group clinical trial included patients with KOA (grades II - III of the Lawrence Kellgren classification) who met the inclusion criteria. Written informed consent was obtained from participants before they were randomly allocated into one of two groups: HILT + therapeutic exercise (group A) or quadriceps muscle strengthening exercises using biofeedback + therapeutic exercise (group B). Both groups followed the same therapeutic exercise regimen during the study.Knee pain severity was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and functional disability was assessed with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire before the intervention.For group A, HILT was performed using a BTL-6000 HIL device (wavelength 1064 nm, maximum power 12 W) following the manufacturer-recommended protocol. A pain relief program (10 W, 120 J/cm²) was administered for 120 seconds per session over ten sessions. Treatment protocol, laser positioning, and session duration were standardized. Two follow-up assessments (immediately and one-month post-intervention) were conducted to evaluate outcomes based on the VAS and WOMAC scores. RESULTS: The study included 40 participants with KOA, divided evenly between the two groups (20 in each). The average age of the participants was 59.34 ± 6.92 years. High-intensity laser therapy group (group A): Visual analogue scale pain scores decreased significantly immediately after and one month post-intervention compared to baseline (P < 0.01). However, the VAS score one month after the intervention showed no significant difference compared to the immediate post-intervention score (P = 0.59). Biofeedback group (group B): VAS pain scores also decreased significantly both immediately after and one month post-intervention compared to baseline (P < 0.05). The difference in VAS pain reduction between the two groups was significant, with the HILT group showing greater improvement immediately after the intervention and one month later (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that both quadriceps muscle strengthening exercises using biofeedback and HILT effectively reduce pain in KOA patients. However, HILT demonstrated superior efficacy compared to biofeedback exercises. These results support the use of HILT as a noninvasive therapeutic modality for KOA, particularly for patients with a higher risk of surgery due to preexisting comorbidities."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback therapy in reducing anxiety levels and improving overall well-being among patients diagnosed with rectal cancer. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 150 patients with rectal cancer who were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 75) or the control group (n = 75). The intervention group received 16 sessions of EEG biofeedback therapy over 8 weeks, whereas the control group received standard care. Anxiety levels were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at baseline, post-intervention, 3-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes, including quality of life, sleep quality, treatment adherence, cortisol levels and heart rate variability (HRV), were also evaluated. The intervention group showed significant reductions in state anxiety (p < 0.001) and trait anxiety (p < 0.001) compared with the control group at all post-intervention time points. Significant improvements were also observed in the intervention group for quality of life (p < 0.001), sleep quality (p < 0.001), treatment adherence (p < 0.001), cortisol levels (p < 0.01) and HRV (p < 0.01). The effects were maintained at the 12-month follow-up. Electroencephalographic biofeedback therapy is an effective non-pharmacological intervention for reducing anxiety levels and improving overall well-being in patients with rectal cancer. The findings suggest that incorporating EEG biofeedback therapy into the standard care of patients with rectal cancer may enhance their psychological well-being, quality of life, sleep quality, treatment adherence, physiological stress responses and autonomic function. Long-term benefits were observed, indicating the sustainability of the intervention's effects. Further research is warranted to investigate the underlying mechanisms and potential applications of EEG biofeedback therapy in other cancer populations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional dizziness is one of the most common causes of chronic dizziness. Associated psychiatric diseases such as depression and anxiety lead to significant impairment, possibly due to autonomic nervous system imbalance. We investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback can modulate autonomic function in patients with functional dizziness. METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled study in 24 patients diagnosed functional dizziness for the first time. Patients received six 20 min sessions of HRV biofeedback or no intervention. We assessed HRV (time and frequency domains), sympathetic vasomotor function, sympathetic skin response and psychometric assessments at baseline, immediately post-intervention (or control period) and another 3 and 6 weeks later. RESULTS: Patients in the HRV biofeedback group showed improved cardiac autonomic function with elevated HRV time-dependent parameters immediately post-intervention [Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD): 71.2 ms ± 38 ms vs. 38.2 ms ± 18.5 ms, p = 0.014; Standard Deviation of all NN Intervals (SDNN): 78.3 ms ± 35.9 ms vs. 48.1 ms ± 20.5 ms, p = 0.001], increased HRV frequency-dependent parameter [Low Frequency (LF): p = 0.001], as well as reduced depressiveness (BDI-II: p = 0.0236). None of these parameters were changed in control patients (p = ns). Dizziness-associated symptoms and sympathetic function of vasculature and sweat glands were unaltered in both study arms. CONCLUSION: In a randomized controlled pilot study, HRV biofeedback led to improved autonomic cardiac function and alleviated symptoms of depression in patients with functional dizziness, most likely mediated by a predominantly parasympathetic effect.",

      "abstract": "Mental health disorders and cognitive decline are pressing global concerns, increasing the demand for non-pharmacological interventions targeting emotional dysregulation, memory deficits, and neural dysfunction. This review systematically examines three promising methodologies-music therapy, brainwave entrainment (binaural beats, isochronic tones, multisensory stimulation), and their integration into a unified therapeutic paradigm. Emerging evidence indicates that music therapy modulates affect, reduces stress, and enhances cognition by engaging limbic, prefrontal, and reward circuits. Brainwave entrainment, particularly within the gamma frequency range (30-100 Hz), facilitates neural oscillatory patterns linked to relaxation, concentration, and memory, with 40 Hz showing promise for cognitive enhancement, albeit with individual variability. Synchronized multisensory stimulation, combining auditory and visual inputs at gamma frequencies, has demonstrated potential in enhancing memory and supporting neural integrity, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. However, challenges such as patient response variability, lack of standardization, and scalability hinder widespread implementation. Recent research suggests that a synergistic application of these modalities may optimize therapeutic outcomes by leveraging complementary mechanisms. To actualize this, AI-driven biofeedback, enabling real-time physiological assessment and individualized adjustments-such as tailoring musical complexity, entrainment frequencies, and multisensory components-emerges as a promising solution. This adaptive model enhances treatment accessibility and consistency while maximizing long-term efficacy. Although in early stages, preliminary evidence highlights its transformative potential in reshaping non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies. Advancing this field requires interdisciplinary research, rigorous evaluation, and ethical data stewardship to develop innovative, patient-centered solutions for mental health and cognitive rehabilitation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), compared to no treatment, is effective for treating urinary incontinence (UI) in women. Feedback and biofeedback are additional resources that give women more information about their pelvic floor muscle contraction. The extra information could improve training performance by increasing capability or motivation for PFMT. The Committee on Conservative Management from the 7th International Consultation on Incontinence states that the benefit of adding biofeedback to PFMT is unclear. This review is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2011. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the effects of PFMT with feedback or biofeedback, or both, for UI in women. We considered the following research questions. Are there differences in the effects of PFMT with feedback, biofeedback, or both versus PFMT without these adjuncts in the management of stress, urgency or mixed UI in women? Are there differences in the effects of feedback versus biofeedback as adjuncts to PFMT for women with UI? Are there differences in the effects of different types of biofeedback? SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 27 September 2023), which includes searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and the reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs in women with UI. We excluded studies that recruited women with neurological conditions, who were pregnant or less than six months postpartum. Eligible studies made one of the following comparisons: PFMT plus feedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus biofeedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus feedback or biofeedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus feedback versus PFMT plus biofeedback, and one type of biofeedback versus another. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data onto a prepiloted form, and assessed risk of bias using RoB 1. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence in each comparison by outcome. Our primary outcome was lower urinary tract symptom-specific quality of life. We pooled data using a standardised mean difference (SMD). Secondary outcomes were leakage episodes in 24 hours (mean difference (MD)), leakage severity (MD), subjective cure or improvement (odds ratio (OR)), satisfaction (OR), and adverse events (descriptive summary). MAIN RESULTS: We included 41 completed studies with 3483 women. Most (33 studies, 3031 women) investigated the effect of PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT alone. Eleven studies were at low risk of bias overall, 27 at unclear risk of bias, and three at high risk. Only one study reported leakage severity, with no usable data. Comparison 1. PFMT with feedback versus PFMT alone: one eligible study reported no outcome of interest. Comparison 2. PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT alone: there was little or no difference in incontinence quality of life (SMD 0.07 lower, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 lower to 0.05 higher; 11 studies, 1169 women; high-certainty evidence). Women randomised to biofeedback had 0.29 fewer leakage episodes in 24 hours versus PFMT alone (MD 0.29 lower, 95% CI 0.42 lower to 0.16 lower; 12 studies, 932 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but this slight reduction in leakage episodes may not be clinically important. Women in biofeedback arms report that there is probably little to no difference in cure or improvement (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; 14 studies, 1383 women; moderate-certainty evidence) but may report greater satisfaction with treatment outcomes (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.7; 6 studies, 390 women; low-certainty evidence). None of these outcomes were blinded. Eight studies (711 women) assessed severe adverse events but reported that there were no events. Comparison 3. PFMT with feedback or biofeedback versus PFMT alone: a single study contributed very-low certainty evidence regarding leakage episodes in 24 hours, subjective cure or improvement, and satisfaction. Comparison 4. PFMT with feedback versus PFMT with biofeedback: the evidence is very uncertain about any difference in effect between biofeedback versus feedback for incontinence-related quality of life. Not only is the evidence certainty very low, the confidence interval is very wide and there could be a more than small effect in favour of biofeedack or feedback (SMD 0.14 lower, 95% CI 0.56 lower to 0.28 higher; 2 studies, 91 women; very-low certainty evidence). There may be fewer leakage episodes in 24 hours for women receiving biofeedback verus feedback but the difference may not be clinically important and the evidence certainty is low (MD 0.28 lower, 95% CI 0.62 lower to 0.07 higher; 2 studies, 120 women; low-certainty evidence). There were no data for subjective cure, improvement or satisfaction. One study measured adverse events and none were reported. Comparison 5. PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT with another type of biofeedback: five studies assessed this comparison, with individual studies contributing data for separate outcomes. There was low- or very-low certainty evidence about the benefits of one type of biofeedback versus another for leakage episodes in 24 hours or subjective cure or improvement, respectively. One study reported adverse events from two of nine women receiving electromyography biofeedback versus six of 10 receiving pressure biofeedback. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: PFMT with biofeedback results in little to no difference in incontinence quality of life. The addition of biofeedback to PFMT likely results in a small unimportant difference in leakage episodes in 24 hours, and likely little to no difference in patient-reported cure or improvement. Satisfaction may increase slightly for PFMT with biofeedback, based on low-certainty evidence. Five of the 33 studies in this comparison collected information about adverse events, and four reported none in either group. Adverse events reported by women using biofeedback seemed related to using a vaginal or rectal device (e.g. discomfort with device in place, vaginal discharge). The other comparisons had few, small studies, and low- to very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes. None of the studies reported any severe adverse events.",

      "abstract": "Migraine, a severe headache accompanied by nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, can be controlled with pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological therapies. In biofeedback, patients learn to voluntarily modify their bodily reactions through feedback mediated awareness of physiological parameters, thus promoting relaxation, reducing stress and preventing migraine attacks. We aim to assess the efficacy of biofeedback on adult patients with migraine. Study protocol was registered on PROSPERO with reference number CRD42024606671. PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar were searched for randomized controlled trials from 2000 to 2024 in English that have evaluated the administration of biofeedback to the adult patients with migraine. High quality studies were included after RoB 2.0 Risk of Bias assessment. ANOVA with inverse variance weighting was used to compare mean differences across groups with 95 % confidence interval. Nine studies (558 participants) and three studies (278 participants) respectively qualified for comparison of biofeedback with waiting list control and active treatment. Biofeedback significantly reduced headache frequency and severity compared to waiting-list control. However, it showed no significant difference in headache frequency when compared to active treatments such as pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. Additionally, improvements in migraine-related disability, depression, anxiety, and quality of life were reviewed. This meta-analysis confirms that biofeedback is an effective non-pharmacological intervention for reducing headache frequency and severity in migraines. Additionally, it appears to provide synergistic benefits when combined with pharmacotherapy. However, future studies should focus on the cost-effectiveness and accessibility of home-based and app-based biofeedback to determine its broader clinical applicability.",

The prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial included 33 patients with post-stroke dysphagia. The study group performed the Mendelsohn maneuver and effortful swallow using game-based EMG-biofeedback, while the control group performed the Mendelsohn maneuver and effortful swallow using only verbal feedback for 30 min in 15 sessions in total. Before and during the trial, patients were evaluated using clinical swallowing assessments such as the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS), Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS), and Dysphagia Handicap Index (DHI). Statistically significant improvement was found in FOIS scores (p = 0.038), PAS-Liquid scores (p = 0.026), and DOSS scores (p = 0.003) in the study group, while there was no statistically significant change in the control group. While PAS-Semisolid scores improved in both groups (study group, p = 0.002; control group, p = 0.023), post-treatment scores were statistically significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (p = 0.031).

The addition of game-based EMG-biofeedback to conventional treatment improved clinical and radiological assessments demonstrated by FOIS, PAS-Liquid, and DOSS scores and resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PAS-Semisolid and DHI scores. In conclusion, we believe that the inclusion of game-based EMG-biofeedback therapy in swallowing rehabilitation programs may have a positive impact on treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Partial Weight Bearing (PWB) is integral to rehabilitation protocols following orthopedic and trauma surgeries. Standard of Care (SOC) for PWB training often involves using a bathroom scale, a method criticized for its inaccuracy. This study aimed to compare SOC training in PWB with a biofeedback device (insole). METHODS: Sixty healthy participants were randomized into SOC or Biofeedback (BF) training groups, practicing 20 kg PWB using a standardized protocol. Gait data, including compliance with weightbearing restrictions (not exceeding 150% of the set weightbearing limit), was monitored using Loadsol® insole force sensors. Participant satisfaction and usability were assessed through questionnaires. Training duration and walking speed were also measured. RESULTS: The BF group's peak force averaged 330 Newtons, significantly lower than the SOC group's 600 Newtons, which exceeded the prescribed limit by over three times (p ≤ 0.001). Compliance with weightbearing restrictions was substantially higher in the BF group (88% or 29/33 participants) compared to the SOC group (19% or 5/27 participants) (p ≤ 0.001). The BF group also required less training time to learn PWB, averaging 9:00 ± 3:06 minutes, versus 12:49 ± 3:01 minutes in the SOC group (p ≤ 0.001). Questionnaire responses showed no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Real-time audio-visual Biofeedback significantly enhances compliance with weightbearing restrictions in PWB training while reducing the training duration. Based on these findings, the implementation of biofeedback devices in PWB training is recommended. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3."

      "abstract": "Medical students often encounter stress, impacting their mental health and academic achievements. Biofeedback is an efficient stress management tool, but its efficacy in medical students is still poorly studied. A key biofeedback metric is heart rate variability (HRV), which detects stress through changes in autonomic nervous system activity. More advanced and sensitive metrics like Baevsky's Stress Index (BSI) have emerged. This study is the first to apply BSI in a medical student sample. We involved seven students who undertook 2-3 biofeedback sessions weekly for six weeks, using the emWave biofeedback program linked to a Zukor game. Both HRV and BSI were analyzed. Results showed a significant decrease (p=0.00781) in median BSI from 76.3 (IQR=52.1) to 45.2 (IQR=19.9), alongside improvements in HRV, suggesting a more relaxed state post-intervention. BSI offers deeper insights into individual stress levels and the impact of a 6-week biofeedback program on medical students. However, the small sample size and external variables necessitate further studies for validation.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition producing considerable distress, dysfunction, and impairment in affected individuals. While various forms of psychotherapy are commonly utilized in PTSD treatment, the known neurological pathologies associated with PTSD are insufficiently addressed by these conventional approaches. Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BFB) is a promising tool for correcting autonomic dysfunction in PTSD, with subsequent changes in clinically significant outcome measures. This paper outlines a systematic approach for the development, distribution, and implementation of a prescription at-home HRV-BFB digital therapeutic. We provide recommendations for evidence-generation strategies and propose appropriate regulatory pathways within existing frameworks. Widespread access to HRV-BFB could potentially reduce the distress, disability, and healthcare burden associated with PTSD. Promoting HRV-BFB as a primary intervention could also serve to reduce the stigma associated with \"mental\" illness and increase health literacy regarding the neuroimmune impacts of psychosocial factors. These processes might in turn improve treatment-seeking, adherence, and supported self-management of these conditions."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: While shoulder injuries represent the musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) most encountered in physical therapy, there is no consensus on their management. In attempts to provide standardized and personalized treatment, a robotic-assisted device combined with EMG biofeedback specifically dedicated to shoulder MSDs was developed. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of an 8-week rehabilitation program (3 sessions a week) using a robotic-assisted device combined with EMG biofeedback (RA-EMG group) in comparison with a conventional program (CONV group) in patients presenting with shoulder MSDs. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study including data from 2010 to 2013 on patients initially involved in a physical rehabilitation program in a private clinic in Chicoutimi (Canada) for shoulder MSDs. Shoulder flexion strength and range of motion were collected before and after the rehabilitation program. Forty-four patients participated in a conventional program using dumbbells (CONV group), while 73 completed a program on a robot-assisted device with EMG and visual biofeedback (RA-EMG group); both programs consisted of two sets of 20 repetitions at 60% of maximal capacity. Results: We showed that the RA-EMG had significantly greater benefits than the CONV group for shoulder flexion strength (4.45 [2.6;6.15] kg vs. 2.3 [0.90;4.775] kg, U = 761, p = 0.013) and for normalized strength (77.5 [51.3;119.1] % vs. 39.1 [16.6;89.2] %, U = 755, p = 0.016). In addition, the RA-EMG group showed a trend to greater absolute gain of ROM than the CONV group (10.0 [0;24.3] degrees vs. 5.5 [0;12.0] degrees, U = 1931, p = 0.067), and a greater benefit in normalized ROM was observed for the RA-EMG (7.4. [0;17.7] %) than the CONV group (4.6 [0;10.8], U = 1907, p = 0.046). Conclusions: The current retrospective cohort study showed that a specific and tailored 8-week rehabilitation program with constant effort by automatic adjustment of the level of resistance by EMG feedback induced greater benefits for shoulder flexion strength and a trend to improve range of motion compared to conventional rehabilitation in patients with shoulder MSDs. Future research should be pursued to determine the added potential of this approach for abduction and external rotation with a randomized controlled design.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects cognitive, academic, behavioral, emotional, and social functioning, primarily in children. Despite its high prevalence, current pharmacological treatments are not effective in 30% of cases and show poor long-term adherence. Non-pharmacological interventions can complement medication-based treatments to improve results. Among these therapies, neurofeedback (NFB) and respiratory biofeedback (R-BFB) have shown promise in treating ADHD symptoms. Moreover, median nerve stimulation (MNS) can help to enhance the efficacy of these treatments, but it has never been explored in this context. This study aimed to: (1) investigate the effectiveness of a combined R-BFB and NFB intervention to treat ADHD, and (2) explore the potential benefits of MNS in enhancing the proposed intervention. METHODS: Sixty children with ADHD participated in the study, divided into two experimental groups. The active group received verum MNS, and the sham group received sham MNS. Both groups performed the NFB/R-BFB treatment. Clinical assessments (i.e., Conner's parent rating scale) and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements were taken before the intervention, immediately after treatment, and one month later. RESULTS: The results showed that the combined therapy significantly improved behavioral problems, anxiety, hyperactivity, and impulsivity-hyperactivity. Moreover, MNS enhanced the positive effects of the intervention, as the active group achieved higher improvement compared to the sham group. EEG analysis revealed significant changes in spontaneous brain activity, with an increase in frontal theta power (p = 0.0125) associated with reduced anxiety, which might explain the clinical outcomes. These changes were maintained 1 month after the intervention (p = 0.0325). Correlations between EEG changes and clinical outcomes were observed, suggesting a potential relationship between neurophysiological markers and ADHD symptoms measured by standardized scales. DISCUSSION: The study findings suggest that the proposed R-BFB/NFB intervention may be an effective non-pharmacological therapy for ADHD, with the additional application of MNS potentially enhancing its effects."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in spinal range of motion (ROM) and velocity during lifting in people with lifting-related LBP over the course of Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT), and to compare these changes between CFT-only and CFT-with-biofeedback. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study. METHOD: One hundred and forty-one people with lifting-related LBP received CFT and performed a lifting task prior to each treatment session. Measures included ROM and velocity from trunk and pelvis sensors independently and the intersensor angle. Multilevel models estimated the average amount of change and inter-individual variability. Time-group interaction was used to test the differences in the mean change between CFT-only and CFT-with-biofeedback. RESULTS: During the 13-week intervention period, the average trunk and pelvis ROM increased significantly between week 1 and week 8 (10.6°, 95% CI: 5.9, 15.4; 10.4°, 95% CI: 6.9, 14.0), while the average intersensor ROM did not change over 13 weeks (-0.79°, 95% CI: -3.74, 2.16). The average trunk, pelvis and intersensor velocity increased significantly up to weeks 9 or 10 (17.8°/sec, 95% CI: 14.0, 21.6; 10.8°/sec, 95% CI: 8.3, 13.4; 6.0°/sec, 95% CI: 3.7, 8.3). There was no evidence for differences in change in ROM or velocity measures between CFT-only and CFT-with-biofeedback (P = 0.14-0.64). CONCLUSIONS: People with lifting-related LBP demonstrated increases in trunk and pelvis ROM and all velocity measures but not intersensor ROM during lifting over the course of CFT. Biofeedback did not augment changes in lifting kinematics.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 stroke patients admitted to the Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Westlake University from September 2021 to October 2023. Patients were divided into an observation group (n=60) receiving the combined treatment and a control group (n=60) receiving standard rehabilitation. Efficacy was evaluated through the analysis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) levels, as well as assessments of several clinical variables, including Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV), Mean Velocity (Vm), Resistance Index (RI), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL). Measurements were taken before treatment and upon completion. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the combination of electrical stimulation with early rehabilitation exercises significantly improved cerebral blood flow in stroke patients. This approach accelerated the recovery of neurological functions, enhanced motor skills, and improved self-care capabilities among participants. The results demonstrated substantial treatment benefits alongside a favorable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of biofeedback electrical stimulation with intensive rehabilitation exercises significantly enhances neurological and motor function recovery in stroke patients while promoting better self-care skills, all within a safe treatment framework. This approach warrants further clinical research and potential implementation."

This study explored the effects of HRVB on self-efficacy, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and heart rate variability (HRV) indices under the Six-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) in patients with COPD. The study hypothesizes that HRVB can improve self-efficacy and quality of life, reduce depression and anxiety, and decrease HRV reactivity while enhancing HRV recovery during the 6MWT. A total of 53 patients with COPD were assigned to either an HRVB group (n = 26) or a control group (n = 27), both received standard medical care. The HRVB group also participated in one hour weekly for six weeks. All participants completed assessments using the COPD Self-Efficacy Scale, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory pre-test and post-test. The 6MWT was administered to measure HRV during baseline, walking, and recovery stages. Significant improvements in self-efficacy and quality of life for the HRVB group, with a significant increase in post-test compared to pre-test and the control group. However, there were no significant differences in changes in depression and anxiety between the two groups. Additionally, the HRVB group exhibited a significant decrease in HRV reactivity and increased HRV recovery at the post-test compared to the pre-test. These findings indicated that HRVB effectively enhances self-efficacy and quality of life in patients with COPD while improving autonomic function. Therefore, HRVB could be a valuable component of pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COPD."

Heart rate variability biofeedback [HRV-BFB] is a non-drug therapy recently suggested to be relevant in reducing both autonomic nervous system [ANS] dysregulations and psychiatric comorbidities. Nevertheless, empirical evidence is still scarce and only a few studies have tested HRV-BFB in adults with IBS. Our aims were therefore to examine the effectiveness of HRV-BFB training on the psychophysiological states of 29 adults with IBS. The study took place in three sessions, spaced 24 days apart. In all sessions, participants completed self-report questionnaires to assess their psychological state (affectivity, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, coping strategy, life satisfaction, illness cognitions), ANS measurements were then recorded of them at rest, during completion of a mental task (reactivity), and while in recovery following this task. The first 24-day period was a control period without any practice, and the second was an intervention period with HRV-BFB. Participants practiced HRV-BFB daily for 5 min, three times a day, for 24 days. We found that HRV-BFB reduced psychological distress and the feeling of helplessness, and led to a decrease in sympathetic reactivity during the mental task. Our findings support the potential relevance of HRV-BFB to manage mental health in adults with IBS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decreasing aggression through stress reduction is an important part of forensic psychiatric treatment. DEEP is an experience-based virtual reality intervention that uses biofeedback to train diaphragmatic breathing and increase relaxation. Although DEEP has shown promising results in reducing stress and anxiety in students and adolescents in special education, it has not been examined in forensic psychiatric populations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate DEEP's potential to reduce stress, emotional tension, and anger in forensic psychiatric inpatients. METHODS: A mixed methods, alternating treatment, single-case experimental design was conducted with 6 Dutch forensic inpatients. For 20 days, participants engaged in 4 DEEP sessions. Experience sampling was used for continuous monitoring of stress, emotional tension, and anger twice daily. A repeated linear mixed model was used as a primary statistical approach for analyzing the experience sampling data as well as visual analyses. Finally, semistructured interviews were conducted with participants and health care professionals to compare quantitative with qualitative results. RESULTS: Of the 6 participants, 3 (50%) completed all 4 DEEP sessions, while the other 3 (50%) missed one session due to technical difficulties or absence from the inpatient clinic. P1 showed a significant reduction of stress after session 2 (β=-.865; P=.005). No significant changes over time were found, although an experienced effect was reported during the interviews. P2 showed no significant results. They reported the sessions as being repetitive, with no experienced effect. P3 showed a momentary increase of emotional tension after the first session (β=-.053; P=.002), but no changes were observed over time. No experienced effects were reported in the interview. P4 did not show significant results over time, and was hesitant to report clear experienced effects. P5 showed a significant decline of emotional tension (β=-.012; P=.006), stress (β=-.014; P=.007), and anger (β=-.007; P=.02) over time. They also reported short-term experienced effects in the interview. P6 showed a significant decline of stress over time (β=-.029; P<.001) and reported experiencing substantial effects. Finally, health care professionals reported a relaxing effect of DEEP in their patients but did not expect many long-term effects because no clear behavioral changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: DEEP shows promise in teaching deep breathing techniques to forensic psychiatric inpatients, potentially decreasing stress, emotional tension, and anger in some patients. However, DEEP is not a one-size-fits-all intervention that supports every patient because the effectiveness on the outcome measures varied among participants. To increase effectiveness, emphasis should be put on supporting patients to transfer deep breathing skills into their daily lives. This highlights the importance for the structural integration of DEEP into current treatment protocols.",

DESIGN: Forty SCI patients (mean age: 32.67 ± 5.08 years) were randomly entered into two groups including the control group (n = 20) and the intervention group (n = 20). Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Functional Vital Capacity (FVC), Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) tests were performed to measure pulmonary function and Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ) was used to evaluate severity of respiratory dysfunction before, immediately after intervention, and one month after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean of pulmonary function tests in the intervention group was increased after the intervention (p < 0.001) and at one-month after intervention (p < 0.001).In addition, the control group indicated no change in these variables. The NQ score also decreased significantly in both groups (control group = p < 0.001, intervention group=, p < 0.001). The change of NQ score significantly differed between the groups (F = 4.67, p = 0.03); also, significant difference was observed after intervention (p < 0.001) and one month follow-up (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The application of visual biofeedback during breathing exercise can improve pulmonary function and mechanism may make the NQ improve as a reflection of lowered dyspnea."

While medical interventions have been the norm for treating tinnitus, few studies have explored the efficacy of psychological treatments and their enduring effects. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief biofeedback training program in alleviating perceived tinnitus handicap severity over a 3-month follow-up period. Engaging 431 tinnitus outpatients from a medical center, the study allocated the control group to treatment as usual, involving monthly visits to an otolaryngologist and specific pharmacological interventions. Concurrently, the experimental group participated in a brief biofeedback training, using Procomp Infinity by Thought Technology Ltd., an eight-channel computer-operated encoder, integrated with breathing and relaxation exercises. No biofeedback booster sessions were provided to the experimental group during the 3-month follow-up period. Changes in tinnitus severity were assessed using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). The analysis, conducted via ANCOVA, demonstrated that biofeedback, integrated with relaxation training and breathing exercises, had a positive impact on both the follow-up THI total score and its three sub-scales (Functional, Emotional, Catastrophic). Notably, the experimental group displayed reduced psycho-physiological parameters in all aspects compared to their baseline measurements at 3-month follow-up. This study's findings underline the effectiveness of non-pharmacological intervention in treating tinnitus. It had a positive impact on the emotional, functional, and physical dimensions of daily life affected by tinnitus."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic pain (CP), affecting approximately 20 % of adults globally, imposes a profound burden on individuals and healthcare systems. This condition, characterized by persistent pain, muscle stiffness, and emotional distress, often results in a complex interplay of physical and psychological factors that exacerbate symptoms and hinder recovery. Biofeedback (BFB), a non-invasive intervention, offers a promising rehabilitation strategy by enabling individuals to monitor and self-regulate physiological responses, such as muscle tension, heart rate, and skin temperature. Through this process, BFB disrupts the vicious cycle of pain and stress, fostering relaxation, reducing muscle strain, and alleviating emotional distress. This systematic review aimed to examine the mechanisms underlying BFB's therapeutic effects in CP rehabilitation, specifically its ability to enhance self-regulation and promote relaxation to improve pain control. Furthermore, it aimed to evaluate the impact of BFB on key outcomes, including pain severity, functional capabilities, and quality of life, with the goal of guiding its integration into contemporary rehabilitation practices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase (2014-2024) to identify studies on BFB for CP. Inclusion criteria included original research involving BFB as a primary or secondary intervention for CP, with outcomes related to pain management and rehabilitation. This review is registered on Open OSF (X5HPB). RESULTS: BFB has shown consistent efficacy as a complementary therapy in CP management, offering significant reductions in pain intensity and enhancements in quality of life across diverse CP conditions. Mechanistically, BFB facilitates improved self-regulation by training patients to modulate physiological responses, such as muscle tension and heart rate variability, leading to better pain control and stress reduction. CONCLUSIONS: BFB shows significant promise as a supplementary treatment for different CP disorders. The evidence that was examined shows that it is effective in improving how pain is perceived, increasing functional results, and boosting overall quality of life among a variety of patient groups."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of skin cancer among Danes is one of the highest in the world. Most skin cancers are, however, avoidable with sun protection and reduction of exposure. One way to increase awareness could be through personal biofeedback information about skin DNA damage. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the influence of biofeedback information about skin DNA damage on Danish beach holiday travelers' perception of risk of developing skin cancer and motivations for behaviour change. METHODS: The intervention experiment included 20 participants aged 36-56 years, travelling to destinations with a high UV-index in February/March 2023. A new technology for detecting skin DNA damage in urine was used. Each participant was required to provide urine samples before and after travelling on holiday and participate in an interview about risk perceptions. The interviews were semi-structured and included the disclosure of DNA damage obtained during the holiday. Risk perceptions were assessed using a scale before and after the disclosure of biofeedback information. RESULTS: We identified key elements affecting perceived susceptibility of skin cancer as well as central barriers for behaviour change. The intervention increased risk perceptions for 35% of participants, and 30% expressed intentions to adopt more sun protective practices. However, most participants' perceived susceptibility to skin cancer did not change significantly, as the DNA damage still appeared too abstract. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that biofeedback information can increase risk perceptions related to skin cancer and initiate intended behaviour change for some. Larger scale studies are needed and should include quantification of the individual DNA damage thereby making the assessed risk more relatable and personally relevant.",

Biofeedback therapy has been studied in children and teens with primary headaches, but not posttraumatic headache. Our goal was to examine the changes in posttraumatic headache associated with biofeedback therapy in pediatric patients.MethodsThis retrospective study included 74 children aged 10-18 years who received biofeedback therapy for posttraumatic headache. \"Positive response\" to biofeedback therapy was defined as ≥50% reduction in headache days per week, or 3-point drop in pain rating between the first and last biofeedback therapy visits. Patient characteristics were analyzed using logistic regression to identify factors associated with response.ResultsIn our cohort, 42% of all patients with posttraumatic headache had a positive response to biofeedback therapy. Thirty-six percent experienced ≥50% decrease in headache frequency, 13% had a ≥3-point decrease in headache severity and 8% reported both changes. For those with daily headaches, 36% had a positive response to biofeedback therapy. School absences, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or prescription preventive medication use were associated with nonresponse.ConclusionsBiofeedback therapy is a reasonable treatment to consider to manage pediatric posttraumatic headache because more than 40% of our cohort had a beneficial response and biofeedback therapy has few adverse effects.",

Patients with constipation often report poor quality of life, sleep issues, and increased risk of mood disorders. Biofeedback is a recommended treatment for DD. we evaluated the effect of EMG-biofeedback on constipation symptoms as the primary outcome and also on insomnia, mood disorders (depression and anxiety), and quality of life as secondary outcomes in patients with dyssynergic defecation. Thirty-one patients with DD (74.2% women, mean age 46.23 ± 13.42 years), diagnosed using Rome IV criteria, Bristol Stool Form Scale, and anorectal manometry, were included. Patients underwent six to ten sessions of EMG-based biofeedback. We evaluated symptoms using the Wexner constipation questionnaire, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), SF-36 for quality of life, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Hamilton questionnaires for anxiety and depression (HAM-A and HAM-D) before and after treatment. As consistent with study hypotheses, the Wexner scores significantly improved after biofeedback (p < 0.0001, t = 6.98). ISI scores improved (p = 0.01, t = 2.74), as did VAS scores (p < 0.0001, t = 5.14). HAM-A and HAM-D scores showed significant reductions (HAM-A: p = 0.0001, t = 5.01; HAM-D: p = 0.003, t = 2.17).

      "abstract": "Background: Approximately 20%-40% of individuals with Tourette syndrome (TS) have rage attacks (RAs), which are recurrent, explosive behavioral outbursts that can cause significant functional impairment. Despite the impact of RA in TS, there has been limited research on treatment, and most studies have focused on pharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic interventions have the potential to improve symptoms with fewer side effects. Mightier, a video game-based biofeedback therapy, may help teach emotional regulation through heart rate control and has the potential to improve RA in youth with TS. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Mightier as a therapeutic intervention for RA in youth with TS. Methods: Subjects aged 6-12 years old with a diagnosis of TS and RA were enrolled between October 2021 and May 2022 into a 20-week single-arm trial. Feasibility was assessed by the rate of enrollment, screen failures, and retention and device engagement. We also evaluated efficacy by assessing rage severity (Clinical Global Impressions of Rage), Rage Outbursts and Anger Rating Scale (ROARS) and overall aggression severity (Modified Overt Aggression Scale [MOAS]) pre- and postintervention. CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) was completed postintervention. Results: We enrolled 11 participants. The study was feasible based on enrollment rate (one participant every 2.5 months), screen failures (n = 1), and retention rate (91%). Mean weekly play time was 38 (SD 18) minutes/week. No adverse effects were reported. Median rage severity scores improved across all assessment measures. All participants reported overall improvement on the post-intervention CGI-I. Conclusions: This Mightier study was feasible in terms of recruitment and retention. Participants with TS and RA used the device often and engaged with the device throughout the 12-week intervention period. Rage severity overall improved across the various outcome measures, and all participants had at least some improvement by parent report. Mightier may be a helpful tool for reducing rage severity in children with RA and TS."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Autonomic regulation has been identified as a potential regulator of pain via vagal nerve mediation, assessed through heart rate variability (HRV). Non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) and heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) have been proposed to modulate pain. A limited number of studies compare nVNS and HRVB in persons with chronic pain conditions. This systematic review compared interventions of nVNS and HRVB in adults with long-standing pain conditions. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library were used to retrieve the randomized controlled trials for this review between the years 2010 and 2023. Search terms included chronic pain, fibromyalgia, headache, migraine, vagus nerve stimulation, biofeedback, HRV, pain assessment, pain, and transcutaneous. RESULTS: Ten full-text articles of 1,474 identified were selected for full qualitative synthesis, with a combined population of 813 subjects. There were n = 763 subjects in studies of nVNS and n = 50 subjects for HRVB. Six of the nine nVNS studies looked at headache disorders and migraines (n = 603), with two investigating effects on fibromyalgia symptoms (n = 138) and one the effects on chronic low back pain (n = 22). Of the nVNS studies, three demonstrated significant results in episode frequency, six in pain intensity (PI) reduction, and three in reduced medication use. The HRVB study showed statistically significant findings for reduced PI, depression scores, and increased HRV coherence. CONCLUSION: Moderate to high-quality evidence suggests that nVNS is beneficial in reducing headache frequency and is well-tolerated, indicating it might be an alternative intervention to medication. HRVB interventions are beneficial in reducing pain, depression scores, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and in increasing HRV coherence ratio. HRVB and nVNS appear to show clinical benefits for chronic pain conditions; however, insufficient literature exists to support either approach.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a prevalent condition that significantly impacts the quality of life of both patients and their partners. Current therapeutic approaches often struggle to address the diverse needs of all patients. In addition, the efficacy of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) in improving ED symptoms has been insufficiently investigated. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LIPUS and to assess whether combining LIPUS with biofeedback electric stimulation for pelvic floor therapy enhances treatment outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved and assessed the data of 68 patients treated at West China Fourth Hospital. Of them, 30 patients received LIPUS therapy alone, while 38 underwent combined therapy of LIPUS and biofeedback electric stimulation. Both groups completed eight treatment sessions. RESULTS: After the treatment, the efficacy of the treatments was measured using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), Erectile Hardness Score (EHS), and Erection Satisfaction Score (ESS) after 4 and 8 treatments. Significant improvements were observed in the LIPUS-only group in IIEF-5, EHS and ESS scores (p < 0.001 for all measures). The positive response rate was 79.41% after eight treatments. Improvements in IIEF-5 scores were observed in both groups (LIPUS: 11.50 to 16.60; combined therapy: 10.61 to 16.90; p < 0.001), as well as in EHS scores (LIPUS: 2.27 to 3.07; combined therapy: 2.26 to 3.11; p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant differences were found between the LIPUS-only and combined therapy groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LIPUS therapy demonstrates potential for alleviating ED symptoms, and the addition of biofeedback electric stimulation for pelvic floor therapy did not result in significantly superior outcomes compared to LIPUS alone. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer treatment durations is necessary to confirm these results.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital and wearable intervention systems promise to improve how people manage their behavioral health conditions by making interventions available when the user can best benefit from them. However, existing interventions are obtrusive because they require attention and motivation to engage in, limiting the effectiveness of such systems in demanding contexts, such as when the user experiences alcohol craving. Mindless interventions, developed by the human-computer interaction community, offer an opportunity to intervene unobtrusively. Offset heart rate biofeedback is an iconic type of mindless intervention powered by entrainment and can mitigate the physiological and psychological response to stressors. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to characterize the translational effectiveness of offset heart rate biofeedback on cue-elicit alcohol craving among risky drinkers. METHODS: We conducted an out-of-lab, between-group, controlled experiment with 26 participants who performed harmful or hazardous drinking. The control group served as negative control and received no intervention, while the experimental group received offset heart rate biofeedback during alcohol exposure and recovery. We elicited alcohol cravings through a series of alcohol cues, including performing mental imagery, viewing alcohol images, and sniffing alcohol. We measured the physiological response to alcohol (ie, heart rate variability), self-reported craving, and self-reported anxiety. We constructed linear mixed-effects models to understand the effect of intervention during alcohol exposure and alcohol recovery after exposure. Following the linear mixed effect model, we conducted pair-wise comparisons for measures between the control and experimental groups. RESULTS: We found that offset heart rate biofeedback significantly reduced the increase in heart rate variability (P=.01 and P=.052) and self-reported craving (P=.04 and P=.02) in response to alcohol cues. Participants' anxiety was not affected by either the alcohol cues or the offset heart rate biofeedback. CONCLUSIONS: Offset heart rate biofeedback has the potential to immediately and unobtrusively mitigate cue-elicit alcohol craving among risky drinkers. The results of this study opened new opportunities for digital and wearable interventions to mitigate alcohol craving, either as wellness apps for risky drinkers or as digital prescriptions and integration with sensing systems for people with alcohol dependency.",

      "abstract": "This literature review explores the role of biofeedback therapy (BFT) in managing functional fecal incontinence (FFI) in children - a common condition with a substantial impact on the quality of life. FFI diagnosis relies primarily on medical history and thorough physical examination and is categorized by the Rome IV criteria into functional constipation (FC) and functional nonretentive fecal incontinence (FNRFI). Treatment options for FFI remain limited, particularly for FNRFI. BFT employs electronic or mechanical devices, such as rectal probes or surface electrodes, to provide real-time feedback on muscle activity and rectal pressure. This feedback allows patients to better understand and control their pelvic floor muscles, improving coordination between contraction during stool retention and relaxation during defecation. It also plays a role in rectal sensory awareness, enabling patients to respond appropriately to the urge to defecate. BFT has been considered an option in refractory cases, although evidence supporting its routine use is still emerging. We conducted a comprehensive literature search focusing on studies from the past 24 years that evaluated BFT for pediatric FFI. Five relevant studies were identified and analyzed, each utilizing BFT in combination with various treatment modalities. Two studies, both randomized controlled trials (RCT) and with the largest sample, focused on the treatment of FNRFI, both concluding that BFT should be used in FNRFI refractory to conventional treatment. Another two studies, one RCT and a retrospective study, focused on patients with FC. The first did not show any additional value in the use of BFT, while the second showed positive results. Comparing both studies, they had very different methodologies and treatment plans, but besides these results, in both studies, they concluded that when selecting a treatment plan for a child with FFI, an alternative or additional treatment with BFT should be considered. Finally, the last study, a quasi-experimental study, did not differentiate between FC or FNRFI and compared the use of BFT to percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS). Although they showed that there were slightly better results when using PTNS, they concluded that both PTNS and BFT are effective modalities in treating children with FFI in addition to conventional treatment. Overall, BFT showed positive outcomes, with no safety issues reported. BFT appears to be a useful, non-invasive option for pediatric FFI, both FC and FNRFI, especially in cases unresponsive to conventional therapies. When used in a tailored, multimodal approach, BFT holds the potential to improve continence and quality of life in children with this challenging condition, and given that 15% of children with FFI, specifically FNRFI, continue to experience symptoms into adulthood, it is crucial to consider these treatment options early to potentially reduce this rate. Besides this, more research is needed to conclude the long-term effects and to establish standardized pediatric rehabilitation protocols."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Habitual movement compensations, such as decreased surgical peak knee extension moments (pKEM), persist years after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), are linked to poorer recovery, and may influence contralateral osteoarthritis progression. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to determine if a movement training program (MOVE) improves movement quality and recovery after TKA compared to a standardized rehabilitation program without movement training (CONTROL). METHODS: One hundred thirty-eight individuals were randomized to either MOVE or CONTROL groups after TKA. Participants were assessed preoperatively, 10 weeks after (end of intervention), and six months after (primary endpoint) TKA. Outcomes assessed were pKEM during walking, six-minute walk test, stair climb test, 30-second sit to stand test (30STS), timed up and go test (TUG), physical activity level, strength, range of motion, and self-reported outcomes. RESULTS: At six months, there were no between-group differences in surgical pKEM during walking (primary outcome). The MOVE group exhibited less contralateral pKEM compared to CONTROL during self-selected gait speed (d = 0.44, P = 0.01). CONTROL performed better on TUG and 30STS at 10 weeks (P < 0.05), but differences attenuated at six months. CONCLUSION: The MOVE intervention did not lead to improved surgical pKEM during walking after TKA compared to CONTROL. However, the MOVE group did demonstrate less contralateral pKEM during walking. The CONTROL group demonstrated faster recovery on the TUG and 30STS, but it is unknown if this is due to improved recovery in the surgical knee or increased movement compensation relying on contralateral knee function."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy can promote the 5-year overall survival rate of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients to 16%-21%. However, the negative emotions of patients, such as anxiety, are usually omitted. Moreover, their disease burden concentrates on pain symptoms, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients. How to improve the negative emotions of PC patients, alleviate their pain, and ameliorate their quality of life has become an urgent issue. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of mindfulness meditation (MM) combined with the BrainLink intelligent biofeedback instrument on the anxiety, pain, brain fatigue, and quality of life of PC patients under chemotherapy. METHOD: A total of 145 PC patients under chemotherapy were admitted to the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Army Military Medical University from January 2022 to March 2024 and were incorporated as study objects. They were divided into a control group (n = 72) and a test group (n = 73) according to the random number table. The control group received routine nursing treatment; the experimental group was treated with MM combined with an intelligent biofeedback instrument. The general information, anxiety (SAS), pain (VAS), EEG signal data (degrees of fatigue, concentration, and relaxation and EEG waves), and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) of the two groups before intervention and 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after intervention were compared. RESULT: There is no significant difference in baseline data and pathological features between the two groups. After the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the SAS values of the experimental group are remarkably lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the VAS scores of the experimental group are apparently lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the score of the quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) in the experimental group is significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks, compared with the control group, the experimental group patients showed significant improvement in brain fatigue relief, concentration, and relaxation levels (p < 0.05), while the experimental group's brain α and θ. The wave showed an upward trend (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MM combined with the BrainLink intelligent biofeedback instrument can significantly mitigate the anxiety, pain severity, and brain fatigue relief degree of PC patients under chemotherapy, thereby promoting their quality of life. It provides a novel intervention for the psychosomatic health of PC patients under chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Vaginismus is characterized by the involuntary spasm of the pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) around the outer third of the vagina, leading to difficulties in vaginal penetration. Physical therapists often use biofeedback to help individuals to gain better control over their muscles. This study was aimed at assessing the impact of biofeedback with dilator therapy on sexual function in women with primary vaginismus. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial study, 32 women with primary vaginismus, aged 18 to 45, were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 16) or the control group (n = 16). The experimental group received both dilator therapy and biofeedback training, whereas the control group only received dilator therapy. Both groups followed a 6-week, twice-a-week session program. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire, which includes six dimensions (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain), was administered before and after the 6-week treatment, as well as 1 month after completion. RESULTS: The analysis of variance test showed that the interaction effect of the group and time on the overall score of sexual function (p < 0.001) and the aspects of desire (p < 0.001), arousal (p < 0.001), orgasm (p = 0.028), satisfaction (p < 0.001), and pain (p = 0.003) were significant; however, the interaction between group and time (p = 0.182) was not observed for lubrication. CONCLUSION: Biofeedback therapy combined with dilator therapy and dilator therapy alone are both effective in improving sexual function in women with primary vaginismus. However, women undergoing biofeedback combined with dilator therapy seem to benefit more than those receiving dilators alone.",

This is particularly true for patients whose dominant side has been affected. The aim of the current study was to explore how effective visual biofeedback could improve fine motor function in the hand and ADL for people suffering from a stroke. METHODS: Ten individuals who had experienced a stroke with aged from 60 to 74 years old (mean: 64.3 years) were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in study group (n: 5) received 15 sessions of visual biofeedback therapy along with routine occupational therapy. Control group (n: 5) received only routine occupational therapy. Fine motor function was measured by Fugl Meyer Scale (FMS), box and block test (BBT), and Purdue pegboard test (PPBT). Also, ADL was measured by functional independence measure (FIM). These clinical outcomes were evaluated before, after, and 1.5 months following the interventions. RESULTS: The results showed that the study group experienced a significant increase in fine motor function after receiving visual biofeedback, compared to the control group. The ADL also improved in both the study and control groups after the intervention, but there was no significant difference between the two groups during the intervention and follow-up stages for ADL. CONCLUSION: It seems that combining biofeedback with routine occupational therapy could be a promising method to enhance fine motor function in individuals with stroke.",

METHODS: In this study, thirty-six childhood idiopathic epilepsy syndrome patients with comorbid ADHD were divided into either the treatment or the control group. All participants' cognitive functions were assessed by a standardized test battery on processing speed, spatial perception, arithmetic, semantic comprehension, forward/backward verbal working memory, non-verbal matrix reasoning, visual attention and executive function before and after the training. RESULTS: ANOVA analysis showed that the treatment group improved significantly on task performances in forward digit span and backward digit span tasks, but not in other cognitive assessments. The findings indicated that the treatment group receiving the EEG-Biofeedback intervention showed improved verbal working memory. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that EEG biofeedback can improve the core cognitive function in childhood idiopathic epilepsy syndromes with ADHD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultrasound visual biofeedback (UVBF) has the potential to be useful for the treatment of compensatory errors in speakers with cleft palate ± lip (CP±L), but there is little research on its effectiveness, or on how acceptable families find the technique. This study reports on parents' and children's perspectives on taking part in a pilot randomized control trial of UVBF compared with articulation intervention. AIMS: To determine the acceptability of randomization, UVBF and articulation intervention to families. We set feasibility criteria of at least 75% of responses rated as acceptable or positive in order to determine progression from a pilot to a full randomized control trial. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A total of 19 families who received UVBF therapy (11 families) and articulation intervention (eight families) were invited to participate. Mixed methods were employed: two questionnaires to determine the acceptability of UVBF and articulation intervention, respectively; and semi-structured focus groups/interviews. Questionnaires were analysed for frequency of positive versus negative acceptability and the focus groups/interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and coded using the theoretical framework of acceptability. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: More than 75% of families rated randomization as acceptable and more than 75% of families rated both interventions as acceptable, with the caveat that half of the participants did not wish to continue articulation intervention after the study. For some families, this was because they felt further intervention was not required. Six families (three in each intervention) volunteered to take part in the focus groups/interviews. Results showed more positive than negative themes regarding acceptability, particularly affective attitude where high levels of enjoyment were expressed, although some participants found the articulation intervention 'boring'. In both groups, there was a considerable burden involved in travelling to the hospital location. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Randomization in a clinical trial is acceptable to families; UVBF and articulation intervention are acceptable and indeed enjoyable. The burden of the additional outcome measures required for a clinical trial is manageable, although there is a travel burden for participants. Future studies should seek to mitigate the travel burden by considering additional locations for intervention. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject UVBF shows potential for teaching children with speech sound disorders new articulations. Previous studies looking at the acceptability of using ultrasound in speech intervention have only asked for the drawbacks of the intervention: finding the ultrasound gel to be cold and sticky and the probe to be uncomfortable. SLTs, however, believe that the technique offers advantages due to its ability to visualize tongue movements. What this paper adds to the existing knowledge This study asks parents and children for their full views about using ultrasound in speech intervention and compared this to articulation intervention. We also asked parents how they feel about being randomized to one of these interventions. Results were positive for both interventions, with parents highlighting the importance of intelligible speech to their child. Children enjoyed both interventions, though the articulation intervention could be 'boring' or 'repetitive'. For all families, there was a considerable burden travelling to clinics. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Clinicians can be assured that both articulation therapy and ultrasound therapy are acceptable to families. Efforts could be made to ensure that articulation intervention is not repetitive and that appointments are offered at locations which are accessible to families where possible.",

      "abstract": "Recovery is a critical factor in athletic performance, and accelerating this process is essential to enable athletes to perform more effectively in both training load and competitive performance. After exercise, immediate recovery is potentially helpful for investigating autonomic activity levels, as they are definable with heart rate variability (HRV). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ten sessions of HRV-Biofeedback (HRV-BF) training on recovery process parameters after the aerobic performance. In this study, twenty-four soccer players aged 18-24 volunteered to participate. The athletes who met the research criteria were divided into an experimental group (n = 12) and a control group (n = 12). Each participant's height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and aerobic capacity were measured before and after the 10-session intervention. The experimental group participated in a 10-session HRV-BF training and soccer training program, while the control group only participated in a 10-session soccer training program. Aerobic capacity tests were then applied again to experimental and control group participants. The effect of biofeedback on the three HRV parameters during the 5-minute acute recovery period after the test was investigated. The results showed that regularly applied HRV-BF training can significantly shorten the HRV recovery parameter after exercise. Specifically, the athletes who performed HRV-BF training demonstrated faster cardiovascular recovery after aerobic exercise. This suggests that implementing HRV-BF training for athletes can significantly accelerate their recovery processes during and after competitions. Given recent technological advancements, it is promising to consider adding HRV-BF training to stress management interventions, particularly in relation to physiological stress indicators.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We previously found that self-guided Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) improved Public Speaking Anxiety (PSA) and reduced heartrate. Elevated heartrate characterises social anxiety and the self-guided VRET seemed to reduce heartrate. Thus, receiving continuous biofeedback about physiological arousal during the VRET could help socially anxious individuals to manage their anxiety. The present study aimed to determine whether biofeedback enhances the responsiveness of VRET. METHODS: Seventy-two individuals with high self-reported social anxiety were randomly allocated to VRET-plus-biofeedback (n=38; 25 completers) or VRET alone (n=35; 25 completers). Three hour-long VRET sessions were delivered over three consecutive weeks. During each session, participants delivered a 20-minute public speech in front of a virtual audience. Participants in the VRET-plus-biofeedback group received biofeedback on heartrate and frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) within the virtual environment and were asked to lower their arousal accordingly. Participants in both groups completed psychometric assessments of social anxiety after each session and at one-month follow-up. RESULTS: PSA improved by the end of treatment and overall social anxiety improved one month after the VRET across both groups. The VRET-plus-biofeedback group showed a steadier reduction in FAA in the first VRET session and a greater reduction in self-reported arousal across the three sessions than the VRET-alone group. CONCLUSION: Biofeedback can steady physiological arousal and lower perceived arousal during exposure. The benefits of self-guided VRET for social anxiety are sustained one month after therapy."

Specific and non-specific tasks were designed to evaluate the intervention. (3) Results: The chess player enhanced the heart rate variability during specific and non-specific chess tasks: chess problems, 15 + 10 games, and puzzle rush games. In addition, the sensorimotor rhythm power decreased during the chess problem and increased during the 15 + 10 game and puzzle rush. Also, chess performance and anxiety levels improved after the intervention.

METHODS: Thirty patients aged 20-35 years with rectus diastasis after pregnancy were randomly divided into experimental group and control group. The control group received routine core stabilization training, including abdominal breathing training, bridge exercises and kneeling abdominal exercises. The experimental group performed core stabilization training based on biofeedback. Before and after intervention, rectus abdominis muscle distance, waist circumference and abdominal circumference were evaluated in the two groups, and rectus abdominis muscle separation, waist circumference and abdominal circumference improvement were analyzed in the two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups before treatment (P > 0.05), and there was significant difference between the two groups after treatment and before treatment. After treatment, the experimental group was further improved compared with the control group. After treatment, the distance between rectus muscles, abdominal circumference and waist circumference in both groups were decreased compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05). The distance between rectus muscles, abdominal circumference and waist circumference of the experimental group were smaller than those of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Core stabilization training based on biofeedback can effectively improve the symptoms of patients with postpartum rectus diastasis, help to reduce waist circumference and abdominal circumference, and accelerate the recovery of postpartum body shape."

To validate the therapeutic effect of the biofeedback therapy, 120 patients with a clear diagnosis of functional constipation combined with anxiety and depression disorder were recruited, and then randomly divided into the control group (patients received gastrointestinal medication and anti-anxiety and depression medication) and the treatment group (patients received combined biofeedback and psychotherapy on the basis of the control group's treatment program). The treatment group was treated with biofeedback exercise twice a day for 7 days, supplemented with psychotherapy for a period of 2 months (half-month intervals for one time). Intestinal medications in the treatment group were stopped after one month of treatment. While for the control group, patients were maintained with gastrointestinal motivational drugs, probiotics, anti-anxiety and depression medications. Both groups reduced the dosage of anxiolytics and depressants after 3 months. The control and the treatment group were both effective and the latter had a more significant effect compared to the former. Moreover, the anxiety/depression symptom for patients in the treatment group was significantly milder than those in the control group. Notably, compared with pre-treatment symptoms, the treatment group showed a significant reduction in Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores in the sixth month (F = 0.008, P = 0.008). In summary, biofeedback combined with psychotherapy may improve relieve constipation patients' clinical symptoms, anxiety/depression state and sleep quality.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of stabilization with pressure feedback biofeedback training and conventional lumbar dynamic strength exercises on pain level, functionality, fear avoidance beliefs, and quality of life in patients with CLBP. METHODS: The study was a randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: The study was conducted at a private hospital in Bursa, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 34 patients diagnosed with CLBP, aged 18 to 55 years. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were divided into two groups with n = 17 in each group. Group 1 received conservative therapy and strengthening exercises, while Group 2 received conservative therapy and stabilization exercises. Both groups underwent 20 sessions over 4 weeks, 5 days a week. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Range of motion, Transversus Abdominis muscle strength, pain intensity with Visual Analog Scale, quality of life with Short Form-12, Oswestry Disability Index, and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire were assessed pre- and post-treatment in both groups. RESULTS: Both exercise groups showed significant improvements in lumbar flexion (P = .011 for Group 1, P = 0.007 for Group 2), muscle strength (all P < .001), visual analog scale scores (all P = .033 - <.001), functionality (all P < .001), fear avoidance beliefs (P < .011 for Group 1, P = .012 for Group 2), and quality of life values (all P < .001) after treatment. However, no inter-group difference was found in any of the measurements (P = .177-.935). CONCLUSIONS: Although we observed improvement in pain level, functionality, fear avoidance beliefs, and quality of life in both groups, the interventions did not show any superiority to each other.",

OH negatively impacts both the physical and psychological well-being of those affected. Previous studies have demonstrated that the biofeedback-based integrated program (BBIP), a multicomponent intervention focused on heart rate variability biofeedback, effectively improves OH, as well as symptoms related to ANS function. This substudy aims to examine the effects of the BBIP on psychological health outcomes among community-dwelling older adults with OH. METHODS: This study employed a non-randomized controlled trial design with a convenience sampling strategy. A total of 51 older adults with OH were recruited from two senior welfare centers and randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 27) or the control group (n = 24). The intervention group participated in a 12-week BBIP, which included weekly biofeedback sessions and group education on lifestyle modification to alleviate OH. Telephone counseling was also provided to promote compliance. RESULTS: The intervention group showed significant improvements in health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, and fall efficacy after the 12-week BBIP, whereas the control group exhibited no significant changes. There was a significant reduction in the percentage of participants in the intervention group reporting problems in all five dimensions of the EQ-5D (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). CONCLUSIONS: The BBIP was effective in improving the psychological health outcomes of older adults with OH. Future studies should explore the long-term effects of the BBIP using a larger sample size and a randomized controlled trial design."

In the current study, we examined whether changes in resting HRV mediated changes in negative emotions during a 7-week clinical trial of HRV biofeedback. Younger and older adults were randomly assigned to one of two daily biofeedback practices for 5 weeks: (1) engage in slow-paced breathing to increase the amplitude of oscillations in heart rate at their breathing frequency (Osc+); or (2) engage in self-selected strategies to decrease heart rate oscillations (Osc-). We assessed negative emotion using the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) and Profile of Mood States (POMS). Resting HRV at pre-intervention was significantly higher among those with lower negative emotion scores. Those participants showing greater increases in resting HRV showed greater decreases in negative emotion. In a mediation model with all participants, resting HRV changes significantly mediated the relationship between training performance (i.e., heart rate oscillation during practice sessions) and changes in negative emotion. However, additional analyses revealed this mediation effect was significantly moderated by condition and was only significant in the Osc+ condition. Thus, resting HRV changes mediated how biofeedback to increase amplitude of heart rate oscillations reduced negative emotion.",

      "abstract": "Psychological stress among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, elevating mental health risks. Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) is an evidence-based intervention with potential to reduce psychological burden on frontline HCWs; however, no studies have examined its use among this population since the pandemic began. We designed a trial to assess the effects of a brief HRV-BF intervention delivered via telemedicine on measures of anxiety, depression and stress, and heart rate variability, compared to an in-person intervention. We hypothesised that the telemedicine intervention would be non-inferior to the in-person intervention. Using a randomized comparison trial design, we tested a 10-day brief heart rate variability biofeedback intervention among frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. They received remote, 30-min guided sessions every other day and were taught methods of heart rate variability biofeedback. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed at baseline, 10 days, and 40 days with additional measures of anxiety measured before and after each session. HRV scores were collected at baseline, as well as during the course of the 10 days. Multilevel modelling was used to examine the change in depression, anxiety, stress and HRV scores across multiple time points and session types (telemedicine vs. in-person). There was no significant differences between telemedicine (n = 32) and in-person (n = 15) interventions on the main outcomes. Both session types showed a significant decrease in depression, anxiety and stress scores across the entire intervention, and HRV scores significantly increased across both groups. Anxiety levels also significantly decreased after each session. The non-inferiority of the telemedicine intervention to a comparable in-person intervention affirms its promise for decreasing anxiety, depression and stress among frontline HCWs and may offer a cost-effective and feasible tool to use in crises situations.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Supervised pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) has been recommended as the first-line treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), but more evidence on whether adjunctive methods would provide additional benefits is needed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of PFMT with or without a home-based pressure-mediated biofeedback (BF) device. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted in the obstetric clinics of 5 participating tertiary hospitals in China. Participants included eligible women with new-onset postpartum SUI who were enrolled from March 28, 2022, to October 13, 2023. INTERVENTION: All participants received 3 months of supervised PFMT and were randomized to either the intervention (PFMT with a home-based pressure-mediated BF device) or the control group (home-based PFMT). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the severity of urinary incontinence evaluated by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form after 3 months of supervised PFMT. The secondary outcomes included the cure and improvement rates, PFM strength, quality of life, self-efficacy, and adherence. RESULTS: A total of 452 participants (median age, 34 [IQR, 31-36] years; median body mass index [calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in square meters], 23.71 [IQR, 21.37-25.97]; median time since delivery, 50 [IQR, 43-61] days) were included in the analysis, with 223 in the intervention group and 229 in the control group. Compared with the control group, the intervention group achieved a significantly greater reduction in incontinence severity (median, 3.00 [IQR, 1.00-6.00] vs 2.00 [IQR, 0-4.00] points; z = -3.05; P = .002), significantly increased cure rate (45 of 223 [20.2%] vs 20 of 229 [8.7%]; z = 12.02; P = .001) and improvement (132 of 223 [59.2%] vs 102 of 229 [44.5%]; z = 9.71; P = .002), significantly greater pelvic floor muscle strength (median, 26.00 [IQR, 17.00-38.00] vs 21.00 [IQR, 13.50-33.50] cm H2O; z = -2.28; P = .02), and a significantly greater correlation between subjective and objective adherence (r = 0.825 vs r = 0.627). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, the efficacy of pressure-mediated BF combined with PFMT was superior to that of PFMT alone. These findings support the use of pressure-mediated BF devices for improving treatment outcomes for patients with SUI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05115864.",

      "abstract": "Work-related stress is a major health issue in most industrialized countries. Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BfB) can promote resilience and stress coping capacity. Mobile HRV-BfB could contribute to stress prevention in the workplace. Little is known about whether the type of training, with digital or live instruction, has an impact on the training outcome. This study analyzes the psychophysiological effects of four-week workplace resilience training with mobile HRV-BfB and the influence of instruction format (digital or live) on training success. This was a prospective, three-arm, non-randomized controlled trial with parallel group design. 73 employees of a bearing and seal manufacturer (58.9% male, 86.3% full-time employment, 67.1% office workers) attended resilience training with HRV-BfB, live (n = 24) or digital (n = 19) format, or served as waitlist controls (n = 30). HRV-BfB training spanned four weeks. Participants applied resilience techniques to increase HRV using visual biofeedback. Data were collected at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and another four weeks later (T2). Primary outcome measure was the Burnout scale of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) at T1. Secondary outcome measures included further COPSOQ scales, self-reported sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), and HRV parameters. Burnout parameters decreased significantly in HRV-BfB and waitlist. The decrease (T0-T1 and T0-T2) showed higher effect sizes in HRV-BfB (Cohen's d: 0.63; 0.69) than in waitlist (d: 0.27; 0.36). Sleep quality improved in HRV-BfB with small effect sizes (no change for waitlist). SDNN (standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals) increased in HRV-BfB between T0 and T1 (d: 0.23;). In subgroup analysis, digital reached higher effect sizes for improvement in burnout (d: 0.87; 0.92) and sleep quality (d: 0.59; 0.64) than live learning (burnout: d: 0.43; 0.51; sleep quality: d: 0.28; 0.22). HRV-analysis revealed no differences between subgroups. Four-week mobile HRV-BfB resilience training reduced stress and burnout symptoms in employees. No significant differences were found between HRV-BfB digital or live. Hence, companies should choose the approach that fits their company profile or, if possible, offer both formats to accommodate the different needs of employees. However, findings were nonhomogeneous and should be verified by further studies.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT04897165, 05/18/2021, retrospectively registered.",

      "abstract": "High heart rate variability (HRV) is increasingly recognized as an indicator of a healthy regulatory system, reflecting the dynamic balance between sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PSNS) nervous system activity. According to the neurovisceral integration model, this balance is managed by the central autonomic network (CAN), comprised of specific brain regions involved in emotional, attentional, and autonomic regulation. HRV thus reflects the performance of the cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation system. Numerous studies support the relationship between HRV and the CAN, including research on HRV biofeedback training (HRVBF). Studies on the effectiveness of HRVBF for professions such as police officers have shown improvements in self-regulation, decision-making, and performance. However, few studies have specifically explored HRVBF's influence on HRV metrics in police officers, highlighting a need for further research. This study addresses this gap by randomly assigning 27 Icelandic police officers to intervention or wait-list control groups. The intervention group underwent a five-week HRVBF program, including group and individual training sessions. Results showed significant increases in HRV metrics for the intervention group, indicating improved autonomic function and stress resilience. Mental resilience increased significantly as measured by subjective measures of attentional control, mindful awareness, and reduced fatigue. These findings support the efficacy of HRVBF in enhancing HRV and mental resilience for police officers, suggesting its applicability and potential for integration into existing training programs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional defecation disorders (FDD) are a common etiology of refractory chronic constipation (CC). FDD diagnosis (dyssynergic defecation [DD] and inadequate defecatory propulsion [IDP]), requires diagnostic tests including anorectal manometry (ARM) and balloon expulsion test (BET). Biofeedback (BF) is the treatment of choice for DD. The aims of our study were to evaluate: the outcome of BF in a group of constipated patients with defecatory disorders of any etiology; the efficacy of two simple diagnostic tools in predicting BF outcome in the short-term. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-one refractory CC patients failing the BET underwent BF therapy. Before BF, all patients underwent the following: ARM. Straining questionnaire. The answers were: \"belly muscles\"; \"anal muscles\"; \"both\"; \"Don't know/No answer.\" Digital rectal examination augmented by abdominal palpation on straining (augmented-DRE). The BF therapist was blinded to ARM, straining questionnaire, and augmented-DRE results. KEY RESULTS: Eighty-one patients responded to BF. Gender, age, and IBS-C showed no significant impact on BF response. Both DD and IDP responded equally to BF, while the rate of response in patients with isolated structural pelvic floor abnormalities was lower (p < 0.001). The answer \"anal muscles\" to straining questionnaire showed a strong association with BF response (p < 0.001). A lack in abdominal contraction and in anal relaxation on augmented-DRE were strongly associated with BF response (p < 0.01). Absence of manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation was associated with BF response (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: BF is the therapy of choice for refractory constipation due to FDD of any etiology, inducing both clinical and anorectal physiology improvement in the short term. Comorbid IBS-C did not affect outcome while symptomatic isolated pelvic floor abnormalities appeared refractory to behavior treatment. The straining questionnaire and augmented-DRE outcomes showed a strong correlation with BF response and can be implemented in clinical practice to improve the management of constipated patients by prompting early referral to BF.",

The scope of the AVATAR system is expanded here in two major ways: (i) through alternative mounting systems to accommodate a broader range of radiotherapy machines (specifically to fit robotic-arm and toroidal geometry photon radiotherapy and proton radiotherapy systems) and (ii) through additional hardware to provide video-calling, optimized audio for clear communication, and combined video inputs for biofeedback, translation, and other advanced functionalities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Because robustness requires strong parts and radio-transparency requires thin, light parts, three-dimensional printing was used to rapidly prototype hollow structures and to iteratively improve robustness. Two system designs were made: one that mounts superior and another that mounts inferior to the patient's head. Radiation dose measurements and calculations were conducted to assess dose perturbations at surface and depth due to the screen. RESULTS: For 6-MV volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, with and without the screen, the mean and maximum dose differences inside the planning target volume were 0.2% and 2.6% of the 200 cGy prescription, respectively. For a single static beam through the screen, the maximum measured excess surface dose was 13.4 ± 0.5%, and the largest measured dose attenuation at 5-cm water-equivalent depth was 2.1 ± 0.2%. These percentages are relative to the dose without the screen at those locations. CONCLUSIONS: The radiolucent screen systems provided here are shown to give minimal dosimetric effects on megavoltage VMAT photon treatments. For static beams, however, surface dose effects should be considered when these beams pass through the thickest components of the screen. Design files are also provided."

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and biofeedback on overactive bladder in patients with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: This research included 45 individuals with multiple sclerosis of both sexes. We randomly divided them into three equal groups (A, B, and C). Patients in group A got biofeedback training and pelvic floor exercise (PFME); patients in group B had transcranial magnetic treatment and PFME; and patients in group C had PFME. Urodynamic measurements were utilized to determine bladder parameters (detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate, bladder volume at initial desire to empty, maximum cystometric capacity, detrusor pressure, and maximum flow rate) for all groups before and after a six-week training interval (the end of therapy). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant improvement in all urodynamic measurement parameters within the groups (Groups A, B and C). Except for the maximal cystometric capacity and detrusor pressure were non-significant improvement in B before and after therapy. However, there was no significant difference between the three groups following therapy. CONCLUSION: Transcranial magnetic stimulation and biofeedback improved bladder function in patients with multiple sclerosis. These approaches have a high level of safety and effectiveness, but EMG biofeedback has superiority.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of ARMM findings in patients aged 10-18 years with intractable constipation over a 4-year period was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 41 patients (mean age, 13.5±2.44 years) included, 20 (48.7%) were male. Rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) was positive in all patients. Group 1 had 31 patients with dyssynergic defecation (DD) and Group 2 had 10 patients without DD. Anal canal resting pressure, squeeze test pressure, rectal defecation pressure, and first and urge sensation volumes were similar between the groups. Maximum tolerated volume and the relaxation percentage of RAIR were higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (p<0.05). Among 31 patients referred for biofeedback therapy, 8 (25.6%) completed the program with complete resolution of their symptoms. The mean follow-up period for these patients was 21±14.7 months. CONCLUSION: DD is relatively common in patients with psychosocial adjustment disorders, and it can be diagnosed via ARMM. Despite the low rate of adherence to the therapy in the presented series, biofeedback therapy was highly effective in resolving the symptoms including soiling."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Giggle incontinence (GI) is characterized by the sudden and involuntary expulsion of urine coinciding with episodes of laughter. The underlying pathophysiology of this condition remains unclear, and various treatment approaches are employed. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of biofeedback (BF) therapy in treating GI and ascertain the requisite number of therapy sessions needed for efficacy. METHODS: Medical records of children treated with BF therapy for GI between November 2022 and November 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. The success of treatment was assessed after four and eight sessions, as well as following three maintenance sessions. Treatment outcomes were evaluated using the scoring system recommended by the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS), which categorizes responses into three levels: no response (Score 0), partial response (Score 1), and complete response (Score 2). RESULTS: Thirteen patients were initially diagnosed with GI. Of these, 10 patients were included in the study as three discontinued treatments. The cohort comprised an equal gender distribution with five females (50.0%) and five males (50.0%). The mean age of patients was 8.9 ± 3.3 (range 5-16) years. Two out of ten patients had a history of previous treatment for overactive bladder, while three had received treatment for primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Following the completion of all BF sessions, the rate of complete response was observed at 80.0% (n = 8), while the partial response rate accounted for 10.0% (n = 1). Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in response scores after four and eight sessions (p < 0.01) as well as between the results after eight sessions and the completion of maintenance sessions (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: BF therapy demonstrates a high success rate in managing GI. Completion of at least eight BF therapy sessions enhances the probability of a successful outcome in the treatment of GI. Additionally, it has been observed that maintenance sessions contribute to the increased efficacy of the treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) has been linked to neurocardiac dysfunction mediated by autonomic nervous system dysregulation, which increases mortality. We aimed to assess if heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback could improve neurocardiac function in CIP. METHODS: We randomly allocated (1:1) patients with electrophysiologically confirmed CIP undergoing early inpatient neurological rehabilitation to additional HRV or sham biofeedback over 14 days. We evaluated neurocardiac function via standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) as the primary outcome, as well as HRV frequency domains, sympathetic cutaneous sudomotor and vasomotor functions and disability at baseline, post intervention and 4 weeks later. The study is registered on the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00028911). RESULTS: We included 30 patients with CIP (40% females, median [interquartile range] age 64.6 [56, 72] years). We observed an increase in SDNN and the predominantly parasympathetic high frequency domain post intervention (ß = 16.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2, 32.6 [p = 0.047] and ß = 1179.2, 95% CI 119.9, 2158.5 [p = 0.018]), which was sustained at the 4-week follow-up (ß = 25.7, 95% CI 6.0, 45.4 [p = 0.011] and ß = 25.7, 95% CI 6.0, 45.4 [p = 0.011]). Patients who underwent HRV biofeedback displayed a higher adjusted Barthel index, indicating less severe disability 4 weeks after the intervention compared to those in the sham group (ß = 23.3, 95% CI 5.5, 41.1 [p = 0.014]). Low frequency and sympathetic skin functions did not differ between groups (p = nonsignificant). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides pilot data suggesting that, in patients with CIP, HRV biofeedback can improve neurocardiac function with a predominant effect on the parasympathetic nervous system and has a beneficial effect on functional recovery.",

      "abstract": "So far, there have been no high-quality studies examining the efficacy of outpatient biofeedback devices in cases of prescribed partial weight-bearing, such as after surgery on the lower limbs. This study aimed to assess whether a biofeedback device is more effective than using a personal scale. Two groups of healthy individuals wearing an insole orthosis were trained to achieve partial loading in a three-point gait within a target zone of 15-30 kg during overground walking and going up and down stairs. The treatment group (20 women and 22 men) received continuous biofeedback, while the control group (26 women and 16 men) received no information. Findings were compared in a randomized controlled trial. Compliance with partial loading without biofeedback was poor; on level ground and stairs, only one in two steps fell within the target area, and overloading occurred on at least one in three steps. The treatment group reduced the percentage of steps taken in the overload zone to ≤8.4% (p < 0.001 across all three courses) and achieved more than two-thirds of their steps within the target zone (p < 0.001 on level ground, p = 0.008 upstairs, and p = 0.028 downstairs). In contrast, the control group did not demonstrate any significant differences in the target zone (p = 0.571 on level ground, p = 0.332 upstairs, and p = 0.392 downstairs). In terms of maintaining partial load, outpatient biofeedback systems outperform bathroom scales.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In this study we examine the issue of employee burnout, caused by long-term exposure to workplace stressors, considering its complex phenomenology in the context of contemporary psychological and psychiatric views. Towards the development of innovative technologies to correct burnout in the context of psychosocial rehabilitation, we present our study protocol involving the ReViSide virtual reality (VR) and biofeedback intervention, including monitoring of respiratory rates and EEG rhythms. METHODS: The randomized controlled trial protocol includes adult participants aged 18 to 65 years (n=140) who exhibit emotional burnout in the workplace. The intervention group will undergo a course of VR correction (ReViSide), while the control group receives a standard psychocorrection. The primary endpoint will be level of emotional burnout to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). We shall also assess anxiety, depression, asthenia and subjective improvement in condition using validated scales (HADS, HARS, HDRS, VAS-A, PGI-C). RESULTS: We shall test our hypothesis that the VR-correction group will show significant improvements in MBI scores, particularly in emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment, compared to the control group. Secondary outcome measures are likewise expected to demonstrate more prominent improvements in the VR group, correlating with the magnitude of burnout reduction to MBI. Analysis of EEG data may reveal changes in alpha rhythm patterns during VR sessions, potentially correlating with reduced distress levels. CONCLUSIONS: We designed this study to test the integration of an interdisciplinary approach for treating burnout, highlighting the ReViSide technology. Confirming the efficacy of this approach for psychosocial rehabilitation targeting burnout states among employees should improve their stress resilience, daily motivation, and work productivity in the context of the modern high working pressure environment and demanding corporate culture.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lower back pain (LBP) is a disability that affects a large proportion of the population and treatment for this condition has been shifting towards a more individualized, patient-centered approach. There has been a recent uptake in the utilization and implementation of wearable sensors that can administer biofeedback in various industrial, clinical, and performance-based settings. Despite this, there is a strong need to investigate how wearable sensors can be used in a sensorimotor (re)training approach, including how sensory biofeedback from wearable sensors can be used to improve measures of spinal motor control and proprioception. RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the wide range of wearable sensor-mediated biofeedback frameworks currently being utilized to enhance spine posture and motor function. METHODS: A comprehensive scoping review was conducted in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) across the following databases: Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and IEEEXplore. Articles related to wearable biofeedback and spine movement were reviewed dated from 1980 - 2020. Extracted data was collected as per a predetermined checklist including the type, timing, trigger, location, and magnitude of sensory feedback being applied to the body. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles were reviewed and analysed. The most used wearable sensor to inform biofeedback were inertial measurement units (IMUs). Haptic (vibrotactile) feedback was the most common sensory stimulus. Most studies used an instantaneous online trigger to initiate sensory feedback derived from information pertaining to gross lumbar angles or the absolute orientations of the thorax or pelvis. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to review wearable sensor-derived sensory biofeedback to modulate spine motor control. Although the type of wearable sensor and feedback were common, this study highlights the lack of consensus regarding the timing and structure of sensory feedback, suggesting the need to optimize any sensory feedback to a specific use case. The findings from this study help to improve the understanding surrounding the ecological utility of wearable sensor-mediated biofeedback in industrial, clinical, and performance settings to enhance the sensorimotor control of the lumbar spine.",

This study investigated the effects of heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) on autonomic activation, negative emotions, diabetes self-care, and glycemic control in patients with T2DM. A total of 61 participants with T2DM were assigned to either the HRVB group (n = 30; 62.67 ± 7.28 years; 14 females) or the control group (n = 31; 63.39 ± 6.96 years; 14 females). Both groups received the treatment as usual, and the HRVB group received 60 min of HRVB sessions weekly for 6 weeks. Participants completed psychological questionnaires, a resting electrocardiogram (ECG), and breathing rate assessments at pre- and post-tests. Heart rate variability (HRV) indices were derived from ECG data, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were collected from the electronic medical records. The analysis revealed significant Group × Time interaction effects on HRV indices, breathing rate, depression symptoms, and diabetes self-care behavior. The HRVB group demonstrated higher HRV indices, lower breathing rate, and improved diabetes self-care behavior compared to the control group. Moreover, the HRVB group showed enhanced HRV indices and diabetes self-care behavior, as well as reduced breathing rate and depression in the post-test compared to the pre-test. However, there was no significant interaction effect on HbA1c levels. Six sessions of HRVB proved effective as a complementary therapy for T2DM, enhancing HRV indices, alleviating depressive symptoms, and promoting better diabetes self-care behaviors."

      "abstract": "Biofeedback therapy is useful for treatment of functional defecation disorders but is not widely available and is labor intensive. We developed an Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) device, enabling self-guided biofeedback therapy. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of self-guided biofeedback therapy using the IoMT device in comparison to standard operator-led therapy. Patients experiencing urge or seepage fecal incontinence (≥1 episode/week) were randomly assigned to either our IoMT system or to the conventional anorectal manometry-based therapy. Both interventions comprised six weekly sessions, focusing on enhancing anal strength, endurance, and coordination. The novel device facilitated self-guided therapy via visual instructions on a companion app. Primary outcomes included safety/tolerability, changes in Vaizey severity scores, and alterations in anorectal pressure profiles. Twenty-five patients (22 females, 3 males) participated, with 13 in the novel device group and 12 in the standard therapy group. Both groups showed significant reductions in symptom severity scores: IoMT device group -4.2 (95% CI: -4.06, -4.34, p = 0.018), and the standard therapy group -4.8 (95% CI: -4.31, -5.29, p = 0.028). Anal sphincter resting pressure and sustained squeeze time improved significantly in both groups, and the novel device group demonstrated an increase in maximum sphincter squeeze pressure. There were no significant differences between the therapy groups. Importantly, the experimental device was well-tolerated compared with standard therapy, with no serious adverse events observed. This study demonstrates the comparable efficacy of self-administered biofeedback using the IoMT device with traditional biofeedback therapy. The results demonstrates the potential of the IoMT device as a safe, self-guided method for FI therapy, offering convenience and effectiveness in fecal incontinence management.",

      "abstract": "Workplace biofeedback and strength training interventions have been conducted to treat neck-shoulder pain among visual display unit users. Biofeedback has been given using surface electromyography, mechanomyography, oculometrics, and spinal posture to promote either muscle relaxation, muscle activation or change in posture. Strength training has been performed mostly using basic exercise equipment according to various progression principles. These two types of interventions would thus result in increased ability to cope with physical workload or improved individual resources. In this narrative review, we analyzed the design, methods, and results of the retrieved studies on neck-shoulder sensory-motor responses among visual display unit users. A few studies have reported both an immediate decrease in neck-shoulder pain and an improvement after the end of the intervention following biofeedback, often based on surface electromyography, and strength training interventions targeting the shoulder girdle. Biofeedback and strength training interventions can respectively modify ability to cope with physical workload and individual resources resulting in increased physical capacity among visual display unit users. The long-term effects and the applicability of these approaches remain to be demonstrated at workplace settings. Future studies could combine both modalities to increase versatility of the interventions.",

      "abstract": "This research aimed to analyze the therapeutic effect of the pestle needle combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback and methylphenidate in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Seventy-eight children with ADHD were selected and randomized into a control group and an observation group (n = 39 each). The control group received EEG biofeedback and methylphenidate treatment, whereas the observation group received pestle needle therapy on this basis. Both groups received continuous treatment for 3 mo. The clinical efficacy, scores of Conners Parents Symptom Questionnaire (PSQ), Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test (IVA-CPT), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), EEG θ/β changes in values, serum indicators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT), and incidence of adverse reactions were compared in the two groups. The total effective rate of the observation group was 92.31% (36/39), which was higher than the control group's 69.23% (27/39) (P < 0.05). After treatment, reduced PSQ scores, PSQI scores, EEG θ/β values, and ACTH levels and elevated IVA-CPT and CORT levels were observed in both groups; the observation group had the best improvement effect after treatment (P < 0.05). Pestle needle combined with EEG biofeedback and methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD children can elevate the IVA-CPT score, improve EEG waves and sleep quality, regulate serum indicators such as ACTH and CORT, reduce behavioral problem scores, and have high efficacy and safety.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The pestle needle combined with EEG biofeedback and methylphenidate in ADHD children can elevate the IVA-CPT score. The pestle needle combined with EEG biofeedback and methylphenidate in ADHD children can improve EEG waves. The pestle needle combined with EEG biofeedback and methylphenidate in ADHD children can improve sleep quality.

This intervention has promise in mitigating perioperative stress, a critical factor for surgical patient outcomes. This comprehensive review aimed to explore the current evidence on the perioperative role of HRV biofeedback in improving patient outcomes, reducing perioperative stress, enhancing recovery, and optimizing anaesthesia management. A review of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify articles focused on HRVBF in relation to the perioperative period. Studies were selected using appropriate keywords in English (MeSH). Ample potential applications of HRVBF in clinical anaesthesia have been identified and proven feasible. It is a non-invasive and an easy method an anaesthesiologists has at its disposal with potential utility in reducing perioperative stress, as a tool of optimization of comorbidities, analgesia supplementation and in predicting catastrophic complications. Although HRVBF has the potential to enhance anaesthesia management and improve patient outcomes, several limitations and challenges must be addressed to maximize its clinical utility. Overcoming these obstacles through research and technological advancements will be crucial for realizing the full benefits of HRVBF in perioperative care."
