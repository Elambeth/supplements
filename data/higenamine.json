      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higenamine, a bioactive alkaloid derived from plants such as Aconitum and Annona squamosa, has been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for treating heart diseases like bradycardia, arrhythmia, and heart failure. It exhibits multiple pharmacological effects, including anti-oxidative stress, improved cellular energy metabolism, anti-apoptosis, and enhanced erectile dysfunction. AIM AND METHODS: To investigate the reasons for these functions of higenamine and its application in the clinic, the literature of the database was searched and read in this study. RESULTS: As a non-selective β-agonist, higenamine activates both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, leading to cardiovascular benefits such as increased heart rate and myocardial contractility, as well as bronchodilation. It has also been studied for its potential in weight loss, anti-inflammatory properties, and antioxidant properties, with applications in treating asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and ischemia-reperfusion injuries. However, its clinical use is limited by the need for further research on its long-term safety, pharmacokinetics, and interactions with other drugs. Despite its promising therapeutic potential, higenamine's inclusion in the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list highlights concerns over its stimulant effects and safety in athletic contexts. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should focus on optimizing its clinical applications while ensuring safety and efficacy. In terms of clinical applications, future research will also be able to explore more possibilities to use higenamine more in the treatment of diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higenamine (HG), a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid in Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (ALRP), has cardioprotective effects. Prior research indicated its potential anti-heart failure (HF) function, yet the molecular mechanism remained elusive. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of HG against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced HF via an integrated approach involving gut microbiota, untargeted metabolomics, network pharmacology, and molecular biology. METHODS: DOX was employed to induce HF in rats and H9c2 cardiomyocytes injury models. Cardiac injury was assessed using hemodynamic indices, cardiac injury biomarkers, and oxidative stress markers. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method and high-content analysis were used to investigate the effects of HG on the cell proliferation, morphology and mitochondrial function of H9c2 cardiomyocytes. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis, untargeted metabolomics, and network pharmacology were performed to identify the multi-target and multi-pathway mechanisms of HG in treating HF. Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry, and Western Blotting was used to investigate its intervention on the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) ferroptosis pathway. RESULTS: HG alleviated DOX-mediated myocardial injury by enhancing cardiac and mitochondrial function, reducing oxidative stress levels, and promoting cell proliferation. Effects of HG on changes in the gut microbiota of rats is characterized by a low abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, along with a high abundance of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, indicating an improvement in DOX-induced dysbiosis. Untargeted metabolomics combined with network pharmacology showed that HG exerted anti-HF effects by regulating eight metabolites, eight pathways, and interacting with ferroptosis-related targets. Molecular biology studies revealed its cardioprotective effects via regulating the Nrf2/GPX4 ferroptosis pathway. CONCLUSION: HG could inhibit ferroptosis and protect against HF by regulating the Nrf2/GPX4-mediated \"mitochondrial-ferroptosis\" pathway, offering a potential treatment strategy for HF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a refractory psychiatric disorder closely associated with dysfunction of the gap junctions (GJs) between astrocytes as well as neuroinflammation. Higenamine (Hig) is a potent cardiotonic ingredient in Fuzi (i.e., Aconitum carmichaeli Debx.) with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which has a significant protective effect on damaged nerve cells and has great potential for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. METHODS: Rats were stimulated by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 28 days while given Hig (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) and then analyzed behaviorally by the open field test, sucrose preference test, and forced swimming test. Changes in astrocyte GJs function and morphology were observed by dye transfer and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Expression and phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43) were analyzed by Western blot. Also, considering the close relationship between depression and neuroinflammation, we determined the inflammatory response in serum with ELISA kits and analyzed the expression of inflammation-related proteins with Western blot. RESULTS: Hig ameliorated CUS-induced depression-like behavior in rats. Hig administration improved gap junctional dysfunction in astrocytes, reduced gap junctional gaps and elevated the expression of Cx43 and decreased the phosphorylation of Cx43. Meanwhile, Hig administration was also able to attenuate the inflammatory response that occurs after CUS in rats. LIMITATIONS: For the role of Cx43 in depression, we did not validate it more deeply in animal models with knockout Cx43. In addition, GJs dysfunction might be associated with the inflammatory response seen in depression, but this needs to be further investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Hig ameliorates depression and exerts its antidepressant effect possibly by improving the dysfunctional GJs between astrocytes and the inflammatory response.",

      "abstract": "Higenamine (Hige), a plant derived alkaloid is classified as β2 agonist by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). However, pharmacologic mechanisms of its performance-enhancing activity have not been investigated so far. Therefore, we investigate the anabolic activity and associated molecular mechanisms of Hige in C2C12 myotubes. In differentiated C2C12 cells dose-dependent effects of Hige on myotube size were analyzed. The mRNA expression of genes involved in hypertrophy was measured. For mechanistic studies, β2-adrenoceptor (ADRB2), androgen receptor (AR), and estrogen receptor (ER) inhibitors and dexamethasone (Dexa) were co-incubated and myotube diameter was evaluated. The interaction of Hige with the AR and ER was investigated. Hige treatment significantly increased myotube diameters and stimulated the mRNA expression of hypertrophy-involved genes. In contrast to the ADRB2 inhibitor (ICI 118551), the ER inhibitor ZK 191703, the AR inhibitor Flutamide (Flu), and treatment with Dexa were able to antagonize the Hige-induced increase of myotube diameter. Hige has antagonistic activity in the AR and ER yeast transactivation assay. Our results demonstrate that Hige induces anabolic effects in C2C12 cells but not via the ADRB2. There are indications for a cross talk between Hige and the AR and ER. Future studies are necessary to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the colon and tends to relapse. Higenamine (HG) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic activities. This study aimed to investigate the role of HG in the treatment of UC as well as the underlying mechanism. In vivo and in vitro models of UC were respectively established in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mice and DSS-induced NCM460 cells. The weight and disease performance and disease activity index (DAI) of mice were recorded every day. The colon length was measured and pathological changes of colon tissues were observed by HE staining. The apoptosis of colon cells in mice was detected by Tunel assay and FITC-dextran was used to detect intestinal permeability in mice. The MPO activity and expression of tight junction proteins and Galectin-3/TLR4/NF-κB pathway related proteins in colon tissues and cells were detected by MPO assay kit and western blot. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in serum and cells, and levels of DAO and D-LA in serum were all detected by assay kits. The viability and apoptosis of NCM460 cells were analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis, and permeability of NCM460 monolayers was detected by TEER measurement. As a result, HG improved the weight, DAI, colon length and pathological changes of DSS-induced UC mice. HG alleviated DSS-induced colon inflammation, inhibited DSS-induced apoptosis of mouse colonic epithelial cells and restored the integrity of the mucosa barrier in mice. In addition, HG suppressed the Galectin-3/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in DSS-induced UC mice. Similarly, HG improved viability and epithelial barrier function, and suppressed the apoptosis and inflammation of DSS-induced NCM460 cells by inhibiting the Galectin-3/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Galectin-3 overexpression could reverse the effect of HG on DSS-induced NCM460 cells. In conclusion, HG improved DSS-induced UC through the inactivation of Galectin-3/TLR4/NF-κB pathway in vivo and in vitro.

Discovery of specific antibacterial agents against F. nucleatum was urgent for the prevention and treatment of CRC. We screened a natural product library and successfully identified higenamine as an antibacterial hit against F. nucleatum. Further hit optimizations led to the discovery of new higenamine derivatives with improved anti-F. nucleatum activity. Among them, compound 7c showed potent antibacterial activity against F. nucleatum (MIC50 = 0.005 μM) with good selectivity toward intestinal bacteria and normal cells. It significantly inhibited the migration of CRC cells induced by F. nucleatum. Mechanism study revealed that compound 7c impaired the integrity of biofilm and cell wall, which represents a good starting point for the development of novel anti-F. nucleatum agents.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common bone disease caused by an imbalance of bone resorption and formation that results in a loss of total bone density. SMAD2/3 signal transduction is known to play a crucial role in osteogenic differentiation through transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). By screening a library of small-molecule compounds, the current study identifies higenamine (HG) as an active osteogenic agent that could be a therapeutic candidate for osteoporosis. In vitro data demonstrated that HG effectively induced expressions of osteogenic markers in mouse bone marrow stromal cell (BMSCs) and preosteoblastic cell cultures. Further, HG treatment resulted in enhanced bone formation and prevented accelerated bone loss on two animal models that mimic spontaneous senile osteoporosis and postmenopausal osteoporosis. IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) was confirmed as a novel target of HG, where HG appears to bind to the Glu-1019 site of IQGAP1 to exert its osteogenic effects. Data subsequently suggested that HG promoted phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 and regulated the SMAD2/3 pathway by inhibiting SMAD4 ubiquitination. Overall, the findings highlight HG as a new small-molecule drug to promote bone formation through SMAD2/3 pathway in osteoporosis. © 2023 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).",

Allergic asthma symptoms are induced by Th2 immune response with the release of cytokines and allegro-inflammatory mediators that amplify the inflammatory response, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and hyperproduction of mucus. Higenamine, as a chemical compound, is a β2 adrenoreceptor agonist and can be used as bronchodilator in allergic asthma.BALB/c mice were allocated in four groups and then allergic asthma was induced in three groups. One of the asthmatic groups was treated with albuterol and other one was treated with higenamine.

      "abstract": "Higenamine, a natural product with multiple targets in heart diseases, is originally derived from Aconitum, which has been traditionally used in China for the treatment of heart disease, including heart failure, arrhythmia, bradycardia, cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury, cardiac fibrosis, etc. This study is aimed to clarify the role of higenamine in heart diseases. Higenamine has effects on improving energy metabolism of cardiomyocytes, anti-cardiac fibroblast activation, anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis. Accumulating evidence from various studies has shown that higenamine exerts a wide range of cardiovascular pharmacological effects in vivo and in vitro, including alleviating heart failure, reducing cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury, attenuating pathological cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction. In addition, several clinical studies have reported that higenamine could continuously increase the heart rate levels of healthy volunteers as well as patients with heart disease, but there are variable effects on systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, the heart protection and therapeutic effects of higenamine on heart disease are related to regulating LKB1/AMPKα/Sirt1, mediating the β2-AR/PI3K/AKT cascade, induction of heme oxygenase-1, suppressing TGF-β1/Smad signaling, and targeting ASK1/MAPK (ERK, P38)/NF-kB signaling pathway. However, the interventional effects of higenamine on heart disease and its underlying mechanisms based on experimental studies have not yet been systematically reviewed. This paper reviewed the potential pharmacological mechanisms of higenamine on the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of heart disease and clarified its clinical applications. The literature shows that higenamine may have a potent effect on complex heart diseases, and proves the profound medicinal value of higenamine in heart disease."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress damage is known as one of the important factors that induce neuropathic pain (NP). Using antioxidant therapy usually achieves an obvious curative effect and alleviates NP. Previous pharmacological studies have shown that higenamine (Hig) performs to be antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. However, the protective effect and mechanism of Hig on NP are still unclear. This study mainly evaluated the changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant system composed of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) through chronic constrict injury (CCI) model rats and t-BHP-induced Schwann cell (SC) oxidative stress model. The expressions of two inflammatory factors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were also assessed. The possible molecular mechanism of Hig in the treatment of NP was explored in conjunction with the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and NOX2/ROS/TRP/P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/NF-ĸB pathway-related indicators. Hig showed substantial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties both in vivo and in vitro. Hig significantly reduced the upregulated levels of ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-α, and IL-6 and increased the levels of SOD and GSH, which rebalanced the redox system and improved the survival rate of cells. In the animal behavioral test, it was also observed that Hig relieved the CCI-induced pain, indicating that Hig had a pain relief effect. Our research results suggested that Hig improved NP-induced oxidative stress injury, inflammation, and apoptosis, and this neuroprotective effect may be related to the NOX2/ROS/TRP/P38 MAPK/NF-ĸB signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the ergogenic effects and the safety profile of a one-component higenamine supplement in female recreational athletes. Twelve recreational female basketball players (age 29-41 years, oxygen consumption (VO2max) > 30 ml⋅kg-1⋅min-1, with training > 5 h wk-1) were randomized either to the higenamine group, or to the placebo group for 3 weeks. In order to determine ergogenic effects and safety profile of higenamine administration, we assessed the following variables before and after 3 weeks of supplementation: anthropometric parameters, resting metabolic rate (RMR), exercise testing variables, serum free fatty acids (FFAs), blood pressure, enzyme activity, urea, lipid profile, and complete blood count. There were no differences between groups in anthropometric parameters, including basal metabolic rate (BMR), RMR and body fat [p = 0.706 (Cohen's d 0.223), p = 0.169 (Cohen's d 0.857), and p = 0.223 (Cohen's d 0.750), respectively], FFAs [0.43 ± 0.03 vs. 0.54 ± 0.23, p = 0.206 (Cohen's d 0.540)], neither significant differences in cardiopulmonary parameters after the intervention period. Furthermore, all measured outcome variables in the safety assessment were not significant, with values remaining stable during the intervention period for participants in both groups. This is the first study to document the effects and the safety profile of higenamine-based dietary supplements at a specified dose in female recreational athletes. Our data indicate that 21-day of supplementation with 75 mg higenamine would not result in improving cardiopulmonary exercise fitness and weight loss in female recreational athletes. Moreover, supplementation with 75 mg higenamine is safe and well-tolerated in younger recreational female athletes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated disease characterized by the typical symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and congestion. Higenamine (HG) is a plant-based alkaloid, possesses a wide range of activities, including vascular and tracheal relaxation, antioxidative, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities. So far, the effect and the underlying mechanism of HG on AR have not been studied. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of HG on AR and investigate its underlying mechanism. METHODS: The effects of HG on AR were evaluated in an ovalbumin-induced AR mouse model. Network pharmacology-based methods such as target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, pathway analysis, and molecular docking were used to identify the likely HG targets. Finally, we validated the mechanism of action of HG through its effects on these targets in human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs). RESULTS: Oral administration of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg HG significantly alleviated rubbing and sneezing in AR mice and attenuated histopathological changes in the lung and nasal tissues. Additionally, HG reduced the levels of IgE, histamine, and IL-4 in the serum of AR mice, and regulated imbalance in Th1/Th2 cells. Using network pharmacology-based methods, we identified 29 HG targets related to AR. These targets are mainly involved in the PD-L1, relaxin, estrogen, HIF-1, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, T cell receptor, and the Th17 cell differentiation signaling pathways. Molecular docking showed that HG may well be suited to the receptor binding pockets of key target AKT1, EGFR, c-Jun, NOS2, and JAK2. In HNEpCs, HG inhibited the histamine-induced mRNA expression and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8, as well as the expression of MUC5AC and the phosphorylation of NF-κB. Moreover, HG affected the changes of AKT1, EGFR, c-Jun, iNOS, and JAK2 induced by histamine. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results suggest that HG may alleviate AR by activating AKT1 and suppressing the EGFR/JAK2/c-JUN signaling. HG, therefore, has great potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of AR.",

      "abstract": "Natural products are a rich source of lead compounds and have shown promise for epigenetic drug discovery. In this work, we discovered higenamine from our natural product library as a potent, selective and cellular active natural LSD1 inhibitor. Higenamine shows acceptable potency against LSD1 and high selectivity towards LSD1 over MAOA/B. Higenamine significantly increases expression of LSD1 substrates H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells MV4-11 and MOLM-13, but nearly had no effect on LSD1 and H3K4Me3. Meanwhile, higenamine dose-dependently suppresses the levels of HOXA9 and MEIS1 that are overexpressed in leukemia cell lines. Notably, higenamine induces cell differentiation of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells accompanying by increased expression of CD11b, CD14 and CD86. Higenamine promotes cell apoptosis, inhibits colony formation, but does not inhibit proliferation of leukemia cells significantly. In addition, the expression levels of p53 are dramatically changed by higenamine in an LSD1-dependent manner in MV4-11 cells. Taken together, higenamine could be employed as a starting point for the development of more selective and potent LSD1 inhibitors. Our work firstly reveals the non-classical epigenetic regulation mechanism of higenamine in cancers, and also demonstrates the efficacy of higenamine for MLL-rearranged leukemia therapy.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Therapeutic effects of HG/[6]-GR on hemodynamics indices, serum biochemical indicators, histopathology and TUNEL staining of rats were assessed. Moreover, a UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS-based serum metabolic approach was performed to identify the metabolites and possible pathways of HG/[6]-GR on DOX-induced CHF. RESULTS: HG/[6]-GR had effects on regulating hemodynamic indices, alleviating serum biochemical indicators, improving the pathological characteristics of heart tissue and reducing the apoptosis of myocardial cells. Serum metabolisms analyses indicated that the therapeutic effects of HG and [6]-GR were mainly associated with the regulation of eight metabolites, including acetylphosphate, 3-Carboxy-1-hydroxypropylthiamine diphosphate, coenzyme A, palmitic acid, PE(O-18:1(1Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), oleic acid, lysoPC(18:1(9Z)), and PC(16:0/16:0). Pathway analysis showed that HG/[6]-GR on CHF treatment was related to twelve pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), pyruvate metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism. Serum metabolites and metabolic pathways regulated by HG/[6]-GR appear to be related to energy metabolism. CONCLUSION: Multivariate statistical analysis has provided new insights for understanding CHF and investigating the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of HG/[6]-GR, which influencing the metabolites and pathways related to energy metabolism pathway."

      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is very complex, and currently there is no effective treatment for CRS. Higenamine (HI) has been shown to improve cardiac function in rats with heart failure. However, the role of higenamine in CRS remains unknown. Here, in vitro, higenamine treatment markedly reduced neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast collagen synthesis and inhibited neonatal rat cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. In our study, a rat model of type 2 CRS was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation combined with 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy (STNx). Higenamine treatment decreased serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen, and brain natriuretic peptide levels and was capable of improving left ventricular remodeling and systolic function in CRS rats, accompanied with decreased expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen I (Col1A1). Moreover, higenamine significantly inhibited the protein expression of phosphorylated apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (p-ASK1) and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (ERK, P38)/NF-κB in cardiorenal tissues of CRS rats and neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast/neonatal rat cardiac myocyte cells. Our study demonstrated that higenamine improved cardiorenal function in CRS rats and attenuated heart and kidney fibrosis possibly via targeting ASK1/MAPK (ERK, P38)/NF-κB signaling pathway. This finding extends our knowledge on the role of higenamine in cardiorenal fibrosis, providing a potential target to prevent the progression of CRS.",

A cold-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction rat model was established and different doses of higenamine were delivered by intravenous injection. The changes of cutaneous regional blood flow (RBF) between groups were analyzed. In vitro, the proliferation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells was measured by MTT. The NO concentration was detected by a nitrate reductase assay. Flow cytometry was applied to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The protein expression levels were detected by western blotting. The results demonstrated that in the model group, RBF declined compared with the normal control group, but was reversed by treatment with higenamine. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated (p)-eNOS, protein kinase B (Akt1), p-Akt1, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α1 and p-AMPKα1 was upregulated by hypothermic treatment but was reversed by higenamine treatment. Treatment with higenamine significantly reduced the level of intracellular α2C-adrenoreceptor (AR) compared with the hypothermia group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression of twinfilin-1 (PTK9) was downregulated in the higenamine and positive control groups compared with the hypothermia group (P<0.05). Compared with the hypothermia group, the levels of ROS and α2C-AR (intracellular & membrane) were decreased in higenamine and the positive control group (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to assess the effects of higenamine on cold-induced vasoconstriction in vivo and its molecular mechanisms on the PI3K/Akt, AMPK/eNOS/nitric oxide, ROS/α2C-AR and PTK9 signaling pathways under hypothermia conditions. Higenamine may be a good therapeutic option for Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and cold-induced vasoconstriction."

Higenamine, a plant-based alkaloid, has been identified to possess various pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory activity. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the role of higenamine in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced inflammation in human nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). The results showed that higenamine improved cell viability in IL-1β-induced NPCs. The IL-1β-dependent up-regulation of inflammatory molecules including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and IL-6 was attenuated by higenamine in NPCs. The increased productions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-3 and MMP-13), as well as a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5) were significantly mitigated by higenamine treatment. Furthermore, we also found that higenamine suppressed the IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in NPCs. In conclusion, the present study proved that higenamine exhibited anti-inflammatory activity against IL-1β-induced inflammation in NPCs via inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway. These results suggested that higenamine might be a therapeutic agent for the treatment of IDD.",

      "abstract": "Chronic heart failure is the terminal stage of various cardiovascular diseases. Despite the availability of several classes of drugs, there is still an unmet need for effective treatment. Based on bench work during the past two decades, we have proposed that enhancement of β 2-adrenergic receptor signaling in combination with the presently preferred β 1-adrenergic receptor blockade would be a promising strategy. Chinese herbal medicines have been shown to be effective in the treatment of heart failure, although the mechanisms largely remain unknown. In the present study, we screened an herbal medicine compound/extract library for β-adrenergic receptor ligands to determine the target of certain effective botanical remedies and seek a leading compound(s) for chronic heart failure treatment. Using a high-throughput screening assay, we identified higenamine, which has a long history in chronic heart failure treatment in traditional Chinese medicine, to be a potent β-adrenergic receptor agonist. Further experiments using specific inhibitors showed that higenamine activated both β 1-adrenergic receptor and β 2-adrenergic receptor. Inhibition of its action by pertussis toxin (a Gi inhibitor) indicated that it is a β 2-adrenergic receptor Gs/Gi dual agonist. Contractility experiments demonstrated a positive inotropic effect of higenamine. In conclusion, we found an herbal compound, higenamine, to be a dual agonist for β 1/β 2-adrenergic receptors with no preference in stimulating the Gs and Gi pathways in β 2-adrenergic receptor signaling. Our results elucidated not only the target of higenamine to explain its pharmacological effect in treating chronic heart failure, but also the mechanisms of its cardiac toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Higenamine (HG) is a well-known selective activator of beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) with a positive inotropic effect. The present study showed that HG combined with [6]-gingerol (HG/[6]-GR) protects H9c2 cells from doxorubicin (DOX)-induced mitochondrial energy metabolism disorder and respiratory dysfunction. H9c2 cells were pretreated with HG/[6]-GR for 2 h before DOX treatment in all procedures. Cell viability was quantified by a cell counting kit‑8 assay. Cardiomyocyte morphology, proliferation, and mitochondrial function were detected by a high content screening (HCS) assay. Cell mitochondrial stress was measured by a Seahorse XFp analyzer. To further investigate the protective mechanism of HG/[6]-GR, mRNA and protein expression levels of PPARα/PGC-1α/Sirt3 pathway-related molecules were detected. The present data demonstrated that protective effects of HG/[6]-GR combination were presented in mitochondria, which increased cell viability, ameliorated DOX-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Most importantly, the protective effects were abrogated by GW6471 (a PPARα inhibitor) and ameliorated by Wy14643 (a PPARα agonist). Moreover, the combined use of HG and [6]-GR exerted more profound protective effects than either drug as a single agent. In conclusion, the results suggested that HG/[6]-GR ameliorates DOX-induced mitochondrial energy metabolism disorder and respiratory function impairment in H9c2 cells, and it indicated that the protective mechanism may be related to upregulation of the PPARα/PGC-1α/Sirt3 pathway, which promotes mitochondrial energy metabolism and protects against heart failure.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of HG in HEK293A cells transfected with α1A -, α1B -, and α1D -AR in vitro, rat mesenteric artery ex vivo, Wistar-Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats in vivo. The radioligand binding assay showed that HG competitively inhibited the binding of [3 H]-prazosin to α1 -AR in a concentration-dependent manner. The affinities (pKi) of HG for the cloned α1A -, α1B -, and α1D -AR were 6.57, 6.48, and 6.35, respectively, indicating that HG displayed no selectivity for the three α1 -AR subtypes. In in vitro studies, HG was able to blunt inositol monophosphate production. It also displayed an inhibitory effect on the influx and entry of calcium ions and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 induced by phenylephrine (PE). In ex vivo studies, PE caused a dose-dependent inotropic response curve, and the pA2 value for HG was 6.86 ± 0.29. In addition, the in vivo results showed that HG could decrease the blood pressure in normotension, spontaneous hypertension, and PE-induced hypertension models. These results indicate that HG can directly bind to α1 -AR and it appears to be a novel antagonist for α1 -AR, which may contribute to its hypotensive effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higenamine (HG) is an active compound derived from Aconiti root with a cardiotonic effect. It has been approved by the Chinese SFDA for clinical trials due to its effect as a potent inotropic and chronotropic agent in the heart. However, the direct mode of action of HG on cardiac electrophysiology is unclear. METHODS: The experiments were performed at both cell levels and the isolated organ. The major cardiac ion currents and the action potential duration (APD) were measured using patch-clamps in single guinea-pig left ventricular myocytes. ECG was recorded in isolated guinea pig hearts. RESULTS: In the left ventricular myocytes, HG increased ICa-L and IKs in concentration- and voltage-dependent manners in the left ventricular myocytes. It potentiated the ICa-L and IKs simultaneously for synchronization. The EC50 values were 0.27 μM and 0.64 μM for the ICa-L and IKs, respectively. HG (0.1 μM, 0.5 μM and 1 μM) had no effect on the IKr and INa. HG slightly prolonged APD at lower concentrations, and shortened the APD at higher concentrations. HG can induce the delayed after depolarization (DAD), which showed some pro-arrhythmic effect. In the isolated perfused heart, HG increased the heart rate via an action on the sinoatrial node cells, but did not induce cardiac arrhythmias, even at high concentrations. The EC50 value for the sinoatrial node that controls the heart rate was 0.13 μM. The sinoatrial node cells appeared to be more sensitive than ventricular myocytes to HG. The effects of HG on ventricular cells and sinoatrial node cells were both mediated through stimulation of β1-AR. CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that HG produced a predominant action on the sinoatrial node. HG appears to control the cardiac electrophysiology through its predominant effect on the sinoarial node cells, without induction of the ectopic activity that causes cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, HG might be useful for the treatment of bradycardia.",

      "abstract": "Higenamine, a plant-based alkaloid, exhibits various properties, such as antiapoptotic and antioxidative effects. Previous studies proved that higenamine possesses potential therapeutic effects for ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries. However, the role of higenamine in cerebral I/R injury has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of higenamine on cerebral I/R injury and the potential mechanism. Our data showed that higenamine ameliorated oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced neuronal cells injury. Induction of reactive oxygen species and malonaldehyde production, and the inhibition of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity caused by OGD/R were attenuated by higenamine. In addition, higenamine inhibited the increases in caspase-3 activity and Bax expression, and inhibited the decrease in Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, higenamine elevated the expression levels of p-Akt, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The inhibitor of PI3K/Akt (LY294002) abolished the protective effects of higenamine on OGD/R-induced neuronal cells. These findings indicated that higenamine protects neuronal cells against OGD/R-induced injury by regulating the Akt and Nrf2/HO-1-signaling pathways. Collectively, higenamine might be considered as new strategy for the prevention and treatment of cerebral I/R injury.",

Higenamine, isolated from Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata, has been used as a dietary supplement for regulating metabolic function. The present study suggested that higenamine enhances Cu B-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells and in vivo. Network pharmacology analysis was used to identify the possible mechanism of action. Cu B alone inhibited breast cancer cell growth, induced apoptosis, and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase. Cu B combined with higenamine potentiated the cytotoxic effect of Cu B, resulting in the enhanced induction of apoptosis and G2/M arrest. The network pharmacology analysis also found that the major predicted targets of Cu B in breast cancer were AKT, endoplasmic reticulum, farnesyltransferase, CAAX box, α, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, RET proto-oncogene, and vascular endothelial growth factor A. The possible targets of higenamine involved in the synergic action were cyclin A2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), dihydrofolate reductase, and protein kinase CAMP‑activated catalytic subunit α. The associated pathways were summarized by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, and it was hypothesized that higenamine may enhance the antitumor effects of Cu B in breast cancer through inhibition of the interaction of AKT and CDK2. The protein expression was assayed by western blot analysis. The combined treatment also resulted in significant inhibition of growth in vivo.",

The compound was identified as 1-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-6,7-diol (higenamine) on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The compound was evaluated for its antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), using Galleria mellonella larva as an in vivo infection model. The survival of MIP infected larvae after a single dose treatment of 100 mg/kg body weight of higenamine was 80% after 24 h. Quantitatively the compound exhibited a dose dependent activity, as evidenced by the reduction of colony density from 105 to 103 CFU for test concentrations of 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg body weight respectively. The IC50 value for higenamine was 161.6 mg/kg body weight as calculated from a calibration curve. Further analysis showed that, a complete inhibition of MIP in the G. mellonella could be achieved at 334 mg/kg body weight. Despite the fact that MIP has been found to be highly resistant against isoniazid (INH) in an in vitro assay model, in this study the microbe was highly susceptible to this standard anti-TB drug. The isolation of higenamine from the genus Aristolochia and the method used to evaluate its in vivo antimycobacterial activity in G. mellonella are herein reported for the first time."

The numerous clinical symptoms of DGP and the great cost on the treatment of DGP seriously lowered the patients' life quality. However, the pathogenic mechanism of DGP is still elusive till now. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of higenamine on the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in DGP rat model. The DGP rat model was built by intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin (STZ) into male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Compared with the healthy control group, the level of DGP indicator c-kit was strongly suppressed and the level of Gsα was largely elevated in the STZ-induced model group. By contrast, the addition of higenamine obviously counteracted the effect of STZ on the expression of c-kit and Gsα. Besides that, higenamine improved the decreased emptying ability of the stomach. In addition, the number of gastric SMCs was strongly decreased and cell morphology became irregular in STZ-induced model group. The treatment of higenamine weakened the harm of STZ on the number and morphology of gastric SMCs. Beyond that, higenamine promoted gastric SMCs proliferation and inhibited gastric SMCs apoptosis in DGP model. Further research revealed that higenamine regulated cell proliferation and apoptosis via activating the β2-AR/PI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, our research revealed that higenamine maintained the survival of gastric SMCs in DGP rat model via the β2-AR/PI3K/AKT pathway, providing a new sight for the treatment of DGP.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Aconitum has been used as local and traditional medicines in many asian regions for the treatment of various diseases such as collapse, syncope, painful joints, oedema, bronchial asthma et al. Higenamine, a plant-based alkaloid, was initially isolated from Aconitum and identified as the active cardiotonic component of Aconitum. It has been tested as a candidate of pharmacologic stress agent in the detection of coronary artery diseases (CADs) and now researchers have just accomplished the phase III clinical studies successfully in China. Besides, a large number of studies have revealed the various pharmacological properties and potentially multi-spectral medical applications of higenamine. However, to date, no comprehensive review on higenamine has been published. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This present paper aims to compile a comprehensive update regarding the biochemistry, pharmacokinetic features, pharmacological activities, clinical and potential clinical uses and toxicities on higenamine with the ultimate objective of providing a guide for future research on this drug. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The selection of relevant data was made through a search using the keyword \"higenamine\" in \"Web of science\", \"Pubmed\", and \"China Knowledge Resource Integrated (CNKI)\". Information was also acquired from local classic herbal literature, government reports and conference papers. RESULTS: In addition to Aconitum, higenamine also exists in many other plants including Tinospora crispa, Nandina domestica THUNBERG, Gnetum Parvifolium C.Y. Cheng, sarum Heterotropoides,Nelumbo nucifera,N.nucifera. The pharmacokinetic studies conducted in animals and humans showed that higenamine conformed to a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Studies over the last four decades on higenamine have revealed its various pharmacological properties such as positive inotropic and chronotropic effect, activating slow channel effect, vascular and tracheal relaxation effect, anti-thrombotic, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effect, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect. This phytochemical constituent has shown its potential therapeutic effects for diseases like heart failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), shock, arthritis, asthma, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries and erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive basic and clinical studies on higenamine showed valuable therapeutic effects on different disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms of higenamine have not been established. Therefore, the safety, tolerability and efficacy of higenamine are as yet, not fully understood. Additionally, some of the studies were small sample-sized and unreliable. To sum up, there is a need for deeper investigation in the mechanisms of higenamine action, as well as well-designed preclinical and clinical trials studies to test the safety and clinical value of the drug.",

Higenamine's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects have been identified in previous studies. The present study attempted to determine the protective effect of higenamine against collagen-induced arthritis through heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and PI3K/Akt/Nrf-2 signaling pathways. A type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) model was established and clinical arthritis scores were used to appraise the curative effect of higenamine. Inflammatory reactions, oxidative damage and caspase-3/9 activation were detected using specific ELISA kits. In addition, western blotting was used to evaluate the expression of HO-1, Akt and Nrf-2 protein in CII-induced CIA mice. In CII-induced CIA mice, the clinical arthritis scores, inflammatory reactions, oxidation damage and caspase-3/9 activation were increased and activated. The results demonstrated that treatment with higenamine significantly reduced the elevation of clinical arthritis scores (P<0.01), and suppressed the promotion of inflammatory reactions, oxidation damage and caspase-3/9 activation. Furthermore, higenamine significantly increased HO-1 protein expression (P<0.01) and upregulated the PI3K/Akt/Nrf-2 signal pathway in CII-induced CIA mice. Collectively, it is concluded that higenamine protects against CII-induced CIA through the induction of HO-1 and the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf-2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, higenamine may be a beneficial drug for protecting against CIA."

Higenamine (HG), an active ingredient of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata, has been traditionally used as a heart stimulant and anti-inflammatory agent in oriental countries. But the function of HG on intestine IR injury has never been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice underwent a 2 cm midline laparotomy, and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was obstructed by micro-vascular clamp to induce intestinal ischemia. RESULTS: In our current study, HG increases mouse intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cell viability through induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) production in vitro. In our in vivo murine intestinal IR injury model, the increased HO-1 protein level and activity, decreased intestinal injury score, Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and inflammatory cytokine expression induced by HG were all abolished with additional treatment of HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX). Furthermore, HG reduced high mobility group box-1 (Hmgb1) expression in IR injury-performed intestine which was inhibited by additional administration of ZnPPIX. And HG treatment significantly decreased HO-1 expression in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf-2) SiRNA-transfected cells but not in control SiRNA-transfected cells. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence HG regulates Nrf2-HO-1-Hmgb1 axis and attenuates intestinal IR injury in mice.",

A beating human cardiomyocyte cell line was used to evaluate cellular effects following phenylethylamine (PEA), higenamine, ephedrine or caffeine treatment. PEA and higenamine exposure levels simulated published blood levels in humans or animals after intravenous administration. Ephedrine and caffeine levels approximated published blood levels following human oral intake. At low or midrange levels, each chemical was examined plus or minus 50 µM caffeine, simulating human blood levels reported after consumption of caffeine-enriched dietary supplements. To measure beats per minute (BPM), peak width, etc., rhythmic rise and fall in intracellular calcium levels following 30 min of treatment was examined. Higenamine 31.3 ng/ml or 313 ng/ml significantly increased BPM in an escalating manner. PEA increased BPM at 0.8 and 8 µg/ml, while 80 µg/ml PEA reduced BPM and widened peaks. Ephedrine produced a significant BPM dose response from 0.5 to 5.0 µM. Caffeine increased BPM only at a toxic level of 250 µM. Adding caffeine to PEA or higenamine but not ephedrine further increased BPM. These in vitro results suggest that additional testing may be warranted in vivo to further evaluate these effects.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is considered to be primarily associated with loss of motor function and leads to the activation of diverse cellular mechanisms in the central nervous system to attempt to repair the damaged spinal cord tissue. Higenamine (HG) (1-[(4-hydroxyphenyl) methyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-6,7-diol), an active ingredient of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata, has been traditionally used as a heart stimulant and anti-inflammatory agent in oriental countries. However, the function and related mechanism of HG on SCI have never been investigated. In our current study, HG treatment displayed increased myelin sparring and enhanced spinal cord repair process. The numbers of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, Ly6G(+) neutrophils and CD11b(+) macrophages were all significantly lower in the HG-treated group than that in the control group after SCI. HG administration increased the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 and promoted M2 macrophage activation. Significantly reduced Hmgb1 expression was also observed in HG-treated mice with SCI. Furthermore, HG treatment promoted HO-1 production. The increased number of M2 macrophages, decreased expression of Hmgb1 and promoted locomotor recovery induced by HG were all reversed with additional HO-1 inhibitor treatment. In conclusion, HG promotes M2 macrophage activation and reduces Hmgb1 expression dependent on HO-1 induction and then promotes locomotor function after SCI.",

      "abstract": "Sini decoction is a well-known formula of traditional Chinese medicine, which has been used to treat cardiovascular disease for many years. Previously, we demonstrated that Sini decoction prevented doxorubicin-induced heart failure in vivo. However, its active components are still unclear. Thus, we investigated the active components of Sini decoction and their cardioprotective mechanisms in the in vitro neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cell line models of doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that treatment with higenamine or [6]-gingerol increased viability of doxorubicine-injured cardiomyocytes. Moreover, combined use of higenamine and [6]-gingerol exerted more profound protective effects than either drug as a single agent, with effects similar to those of dexrazoxane, a clinically approved cardiac protective agent. In addition, we found that treatment with doxorubicin reduced SOD activity, increased ROS generation, enhanced MDA formation, induced release of LDH, and triggered the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway in cardiomyocytes, which was inhibited by cotreatment of higenamine and [6]-gingerol. Most importantly, the cytoprotection of higenamine plus [6]-gingerol could be abrogated by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. In conclusion, combination of higenamine and [6]-gingerol exerts cardioprotective effect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Higenamine and [6]-gingerol may be the active components of Sini decoction."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism of racemic higenamine in the treatment of sick sinus syndrome (SSS). A total of 40 New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into normal sinus node and damaged sinus node (SND) groups, and each group was randomly divided into treatment and control groups (n=10). The SND model was established by formaldehyde wet dressing of the sinus node area. The treatment groups were administered an intravenous infusion of 0.04 mg/kg racemic higenamine via the marginal ear vein within 5 min. The electrophysiological indicators of sinoatrial function, including the sinus node recovery time (SNRT), corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT), total sinoatrial conduction time (TSACT) and sinus cycle length (SCL), were determined before and 20 min after medication and the changes in these indicators were evaluated. The two control groups were administered 10 ml physiological saline. Following the administration of racemic higenamine, the SNRT, CSNRT, TSACT and SCL in the normal sinus node and SND groups were significantly shortened compared with those in the control groups (P<0.01). The electrophysiological influence of racemic higenamine on sinoatrial function in the SND group was significantly greater than that in the normal sinus node group (P<0.01), and its effect in the treatment of arrhythmia caused by a damaged sinus node was statistically significant (P<0.05). The main electrophysiological mechanism of racemic higenamine in the treatment of SSS was the enhancement of sinus node self-discipline and improvement of sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction function."

      "abstract": "Growing lines of evidence suggests that high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) plays an important role for promoting inflammation and apoptosis in brain ischemia. Previously, we demonstrated that inducers of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) significantly reduce HMGB1 release in inflammatory conditions in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we tested our hypothesis that higenamine protects brain injury by inhibition of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-mediated HMGB1 release in vivo, and glucose/glucose oxidase (GOX)-induced apoptosis in C6 cells in vitro due to HO-1 induction. Higenamine increased HO-1 expression in C6 cells in both hypoxia and normoxia, in which the former was much more significant than the latter. Higenamine increased Nrf-2 luciferase activity, translocated Nrf-2 to nucleus, and increased phosphorylation of Akt in C6 cells. Consistent with this, LY 294002, a PI3K inhibitor, inhibited HO-1 induction by higenamine and apoptosis induced by glucose/GOX in C6 cells was prevented by higenamine, which effect was reversed by LY 294002. Importantly, administration of higenamine (i.p) significantly reduced brain infarct size, mortality rate, MPO activity and tissue expression of HMGB1 in MCAO rats. In addition, recombinant high mobility group box 1 induced apoptosis in C6 cells by increasing ratio of Bax/bcl-2 and cleaved caspase c, which was inhibited by higenamine, and all of these effects were reversed by co-treatment with ZnPPIX. Therefore, we conclude that higenamine, at least in part, protects brain cells against hypoxic damages by up-regulation of HO-1. Thus, higenamine may be beneficial for the use of ischemic injuries such as stroke.",

Higenamine decreased the intracellular dopamine content dose-dependently and showed 55.2% inhibition of dopamine content in PC12 cells at a concentration of 20 microM with 24 h incubation. The IC50 value of higenamine was 18.2 microM. Dopamine content was lowered and reached minimal level at 12-24 h after exposure to higenamine. In this condition, tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, was also inhibited by the treatment of higenamine in PC12 cells (21.9% inhibition at 20 microM). Higenamine at 20 microM lowered the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by 33.1% inhibition relative to control in PC12 cells. These results suggest that the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by higenamine might partially contribute to the decrease in dopamine content in PC12 cells.",

The actions of higenamine on the action potential of Purkinje cells were: (1) increase of amplitude of the plateau phase, (2) enhancement of repolarization of phase 3 and shortening of action potential duration (APD), (3) lower concentration of higenamine (10(-7) g/ml) causing shortening of APD without any significant change of the effective refractory period (ERP), and higher concentration (10(-6) g/ml) of it causing shortening of both APD and ERP, (4) higher concentration (10(-6) g/ml) of higenamine increasing the slope of phase 4, decreasing the threshold of depolarization, and increasing the automaticity of the Purkinje cells, (5) action of higenamine on the Purkinje cells only partially blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and verapamil. The above facts suggest that: (1) higher concentration of higenamine may induce tachyarrhythmias, while lower concentration may prevent arrhythmias; (2) in low concentration of higenamine, there is a relative increase of ERP. Thus, higenamine seems to be safer than isoproterenol in the treatment of bradyarrhythmias.",
