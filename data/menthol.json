      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the pulmonary effects induced by the inhalation of menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosols on asthma exacerbation, despite the popularity of these devices and flavors among youth and young adults. In the lungs, matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) expressed and secreted by both alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells plays an essential role in airway remodeling, a key feature of severe asthma. In this study, we investigated the role of MMP12 in menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosol exposures plus house-dust mite (HDM)-induced asthmatic responses. METHODS: We exposed wild-type (WT) and MMP12 knockout (KO) juvenile female mice to well-characterized menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosols followed by either PBS or HDM treatment, and evaluated pulmonary outcomes in terms of iron metabolism, oxidative stress responses and pulmonary inflammation. RESULTS: We found high levels of iron in the menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosol. This correlated with e-cigarette + HDM WT mice exhibiting disruption of pulmonary iron metabolism, suggesting a defense mechanism against iron-mediated toxicity. This was evidenced by altered lung protein concentrations of ferroportin, ferritin, lactoferrin, and transferrin, activation of the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway and up-regulated expression of NQO1 in e-cigarette + HDM WT mice. Further, despite decreased neutrophilic inflammation, MUC5AC, an oxidative stress inducible mucin, was increased in the e-cigarette + HDM WT mice. In contrast, MMP12 KO mice were protected against iron-induced oxidative stress responses, highlighting a crucial role of MMP12 in this model. CONCLUSION: These findings revealed in vivo evidence supporting a crucial role for iron metabolism in nicotine salt iron-rich ENDS aerosol toxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Menthol-flavored tobacco products are disproportionately used in low-income African American communities, a result of decades of targeted marketing and systemic inequities. Menthol use has been associated with lower quit rates, often compounded by factors such as lower trust in healthcare systems, reduced access to cessation programs, and other structural barriers. Despite this, few studies have systematically examined the explanatory mechanisms that might clarify why menthol-flavored tobacco is linked to poorer cessation outcomes among participants in tobacco cessation programs. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms by which menthol tobacco use is associated with lower quit rates across three types of smoking cessation interventions. METHODS: Participants were randomized into one of three smoking cessation interventions: in-person (CEASE), self-help, or online/hybrid programs. Smoking abstinence was assessed three months post-intervention as the primary outcome. Secondary analyses explored whether demographic, socioeconomic, or behavioral factors mediated the association between menthol use and quit rates across the intervention arms. RESULTS: Menthol tobacco use was significantly associated with lower quit rates (p < 0.01). This association was not explained by demographic, socioeconomic, health, or addiction-related factors. While menthol use was associated with lower education and employment levels, demographic characteristics, physical or mental health, or addiction did not explain the effect of menthol on tobacco cessation. These findings suggest that the lower quit rates observed among menthol users cannot be attributed to any third factors assessed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Menthol tobacco use independently predicts lower quit rates, and the mechanisms behind this disparity remain unclear. The consistent findings across different intervention types highlight the need for further research to uncover the underlying pathways and to design targeted strategies to improve cessation outcomes for menthol users."

      "abstract": "Menthol, the primary active compound in the widely cultivated peppermint plant (Mentha piperita), is well known for its use in human products such as topical analgesics and cold remedies. Menthol's cooling sensation and ability to locally modulate pain through interactions with transient receptor potential channels make it a valuable bioactive compound. In recent years, menthol's antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties have drawn attention in the livestock industry as a natural alternative to synthetic antibiotics in feed additives. This review comprehensively examines the existing literature to assess menthol's effects on animal growth performance, product quality, immune function, gastrointestinal microbial ecosystems, and metabolism across various livestock species. Notably, menthol shows potential for improving feed efficiency, mitigating chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, inhibiting environmental and gastrointestinal pathogens, and enhancing calcium absorption. However, optimal dosages, treatment durations, synergies with other phytogenic compounds, and regulatory mechanisms require further investigation. Additionally, with increasing global temperatures and growing concerns about animal welfare, menthol's cooling, methane-reducing, and analgesic properties present promising opportunities for advancing sustainable livestock practices.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pregnant people who smoke constitute a uniquely vulnerable population likely to be impacted by a menthol cigarette (MC) ban. However, there are no published reports of prevalence of prenatal MC use in a nationally-representative US sample including racial-ethnic disparities and associated characteristics. METHODS: Participants were 1245 US pregnant people who smoked MC or non-MC (NMC) in the past 30-days from the 2010-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Prevalence of past 30-day MC use was determined; weighted socio-demographic characteristics, tobacco use, and substance co-use were compared across MC and NMC groups and in multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence of MC use among pregnant people who smoked was 52.29% (95% CI: 48.17, 56.41) overall and 92.23% (95% CI: 87.74-96.73) among non-Hispanic Black pregnant people who smoked. A greater proportion of pregnant people who used MCs (vs NMCs) were Non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic, unmarried, sexual minorities, from a large metropolitan area, smoked fewer cigarettes per day and reported later age of initiation. In multivariable analyses, only non-Hispanic Black race remained a significant predictor of MC use; non-Hispanic Black (vs non-Hispanic White) pregnant people who smoked showed 13.88 times (95% CI: 6.30-30.58) greater odds of MC use (p<.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to determine prevalence and correlates of prenatal MC use in a nationally representative US sample. Given known causal impacts of prenatal smoking on maternal and infant morbidity, results suggest that the planned menthol ban offers opportunities for improving maternal and infant health. IMPLICATIONS: Using a nationally-representative US sample, this study highlights that more than half of pregnant people who smoke and nearly all of Black pregnant people who smoke in the US use menthol cigarettes. Given high rates of menthol cigarette use and causal links between prenatal cigarette use and maternal and infant morbidity, the menthol cigarette ban proposed by the FDA offers a potential opportunity to develop tailored education and intervention strategies to improve perinatal and infant health."

      "abstract": "Obesity, recognized as a metabolic disease and a global epidemic, calls for novel pharmacological interventions. Menthol, an organic compound, has shown promise in increasing energy expenditure and has been proposed as a potential anti-obesity drug. While preclinical studies have demonstrated menthol's preventive effect on body mass gain, none have investigated its efficacy in treating obesity. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of menthol in obesity treatment. Obesity was induced in rats through a hypercaloric diet. Obese rats were subjected to intermittent topical treatment with 5% menthol, resulting in sustained hyperthermia indicative of increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Additionally, menthol led to a reduction in the area of white adipocytes as a result of weight loss in obese rats. Our findings suggest that menthol has the potential to enhance metabolism and may serve as a viable treatment option for obesity. These results highlight the physiological significance of menthol in modulating metabolic processes and its potential role in combating obesity-related metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Chicken thigh is a popular and widely consumed meat product. However, its high moisture content and susceptibility to microbial spoilage limit its shelf life. To address this issue, we investigated the efficacy of an edible coating based on alginate nanoparticles (AlgNPs) containing menthol, Zataria multiflora essential oil (EO), or their combination for extending the shelf life of chicken thigh. The nanoparticles were prepared through ionic gelation methods; their particle size was obtained as 87-205 nm with PDI values of < 0.3 and SPAN values of < 1. The AlgNPs containing both menthol and the EO showed the most potent antimicrobial activity (the lowest counts of pseudomonas, aerobic mesophilic, and yeast-mold), during cold storage. This coating treatment showed also the highest antioxidant activities, with the lowest thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), pH and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) values. Moreover, this coating significantly (p < 0.05) showed the highest sensory quality of chicken thighs, as evidenced by the higher sensory scores for texture, odor, color, and overall acceptability. Therefore, the edible coating based on AlgNPs containing menthol and Z. multiflora EO is an effective and promising approach for extending the shelf life of chicken thighs."

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common intestinal disease characterized by abdominal pain, abdominal distension and irregular defecation frequency, and it has had a high incidence and low cure rate in recent years. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) is one of the main physiological indicators of IBS, and TRPV1 and TRPM8 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and melastatin 8) play crucial roles in VH and are widely distributed in the intestine, significantly impacting abdominal pain in IBS patients. Under the guidance of PRISMA, four databases were systematically searched at the outset, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting specific abdominal pain scores (rather than the incidence rate) in IBS patients receiving capsaicin or menthol (agonist of TRPV1 and TRPM8) interventions were included. A meta-analysis was conducted on the retrieved studies, which consisted of three articles on capsaicin and five articles on menthol, to compare the efficacy of capsaicin and menthol in alleviating abdominal pain in IBS patients under conditions of low heterogeneity. The results demonstrated that menthol had a significant effect in relieving abdominal pain in IBS patients. Conversely, although the effect of capsaicin was not statistically significant, two studies involving long-term capsaicin intervention suggested its potential to reduce VH and subsequently relieve abdominal pain, which may be attributed to the up-regulation of the TRPV1 receptor in the gastrointestinal tract of individuals with IBS.",

Therefore, our objective was to investigate anti-quorum sensing and anti-biofilm potentials of menthol in Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. METHODS: The antifungal properties of menthol were evaluated using a broth microdilution assay and a time-kill assay, and its effects on quorum sensing-mediated virulence factors, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and biofilm formation were tested by evaluating TUP1 expression levels in both C. albicans and C. glabrata. RESULTS: Quorum sensing-mediated virulence factors and biofilm formation were inhibited by menthol in both C. albicans and C. glabrata. Furthermore, coinciding with elevated ROS levels, mRNAs of the quorum sensing-related gene TUP1 were upregulated in both C. albicans and C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the anti-quorum sensing potential of menthol through the inhibition of quorum sensing-mediated virulence factors, ROS generation, and biofilm development by targeting TUP1, which could have potential in the treatment of Candida infections.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Metabolic comorbidities such as obesity type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia are the major contributors for lower life expectancy and reduced patient compliance during antipsychotic therapy in patients with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. TRPM8 activation by menthol is also reported to alleviate high fat diet-induced obesity in mice. Additionally, this TRPM8 activation leads to increase in gene expression of thermogenic genes in white adipocytes and dietary menthol was found to increase browning of WAT along with improved glucose utilization. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the plausible role of TRPM8 channels in olanzapine-induced metabolic alterations in female balb/c mice. METHODS: 6 weeks olanzapine (6 mg kg-1, per oral) model was used in female balb/c mice. Pharmacological manipulation of TRPM8 channel was done using menthol and N-(3-aminopropyl)-2-[(3-methylphenyl)methoxy]-N-(2-thienylmethyl)-benzamide (AMTB), the agonist and antagonist respectively. KEY RESULTS: Menthol co-treatment for six weeks prevented olanzapine-induced metabolic alterations such as weight gain, increased food intake, decreased energy expenditure, adiposity, liver lipid accumulation, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. Although no significant change in TRPM8 mRNA expression was found in the hypothalamus, however, some of the protective effects of menthol were absent in presence of AMTB indicating possible involvement of TRPM8 channels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest possible therapeutic implications of menthol in the management of antipsychotic-induced weight gain and other metabolic alterations.",

Therefore, topical anti-inflammatory drugs are considered a suitable alternative for certain patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the skin penetration capacity and anti-inflammatory efficacy of a methyl salicylate gel (MS) with turpentine essence, camphor and menthol (GelSMETAM). METHODS: Human skin explants were used (three biological replicates with 3 technical replicates each were performed). To assess penetration capacity, methyl salicylate (MS) levels were quantified at different intervals using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For the anti-inflammatory effect, the gene expression of major pro-inflammatory factors was quantified 30 minutes, 8 hours, and 12 hours after an impact; comparing GelSMETAM application with untreated controls. RESULTS: The results showed that approximately 0.8% of the total applied methyl salicylate penetrated the skin with a time-dependent concentration increase. The anti-inflammatory effect demonstrated a significant reduction in the gene expression of TNFα, IL1α, IL6, IL8, and NFKβ at 30 minutes (between -39% and -53.6% compared to control), which was maintained at 8 hours except for TNFα (between -59% and -92.6%) and persisted even at 12 hours (-69.4%) for IL1α. CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis that GelSMETAM provides an effective and prolonged anti-inflammatory response, positioning it as a suitable option for the management of musculoskeletal pain.",

Here, we investigated the effects of menthol, a natural monoterpene, on HE induced by thioacetamide (TA) in male Wistar rats. The rats received 200 mg/kg of TA twice a week for four weeks and were administered 10 mg/kg of menthol intraperitoneally daily for the same period. The results showed that menthol treatment reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in the livers and hippocampi of the rats that received TA. It also lowered the levels of ammonium and liver enzymes AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT in the serum of these animals and prevented liver histopathological damage. In addition, the expression and activity of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampus of HE model rats were decreased by menthol. Likewise, this monoterpene reduced the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB in the hippocampus while increasing the expression of BDNF and α7-nACh receptor. Menthol also reduced neuronal death in the hippocampal cornu ammonis-1 and dentate gyrus regions and reduced astrocyte swelling, which led to improved learning and spatial memory in rats with HE. In conclusion, the study suggests that menthol may have strong protective effects on the liver and brain, making it a potential treatment for HE and neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This research aims to investigate the protective action of menthol dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on experimental epileptiform activity induced by the intraperitoneal (IP) injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in male rats. METHODS: Thirty adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were randomly assigned to five equal groups. The control animals received normal saline (200 μL) and the rest four cohorts were considered as treatment. Menthol was dissolved in DMSO and intraperitoneally injected at the doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg into the first, second, and third groups (M100, M200, and M400 V=200 μL), respectively. The fourth treatment was injected with the solvent (200 μL). The animals were anesthetized, then underwent cranial surgery and a recording electrode was implanted in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) region (AP=-2.76 mm, ML=-1.4 mm and DV=3 mm). The seizure activity was induced by PTZ (IP) and assessed by counting and measuring amplitudes of the spikes for 10 minutes using the eTrace program. RESULTS: Menthol was observed to significantly reduce the activity level of PTZ-induced epileptiform activity, as well as exert a protective and inhibitory action on proconvulsant effect of DMSO in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Menthol can potentially be used as an adjuvant to prevent seizure activity. HIGHLIGHTS: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induces proconvulsant effects, significantly increasing spike counts.Menthol 100 mg/kg also stimulates seizure activity, leading to a substantial spike count increase.Menthol 200 and 400 mg/kg exhibit inhibitory effects, decreasing seizure activity and spike counts. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In this study, we explored the potential protective effects of menthol, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), on experimentally induced epileptiform activity in male rats. Our research involved thirty adult male Wistar rats, divided into five groups. While the control group received normal saline, the remaining four groups were treated with different doses of menthol in DMSO. The rats underwent surgery, and electrodes were implanted in the hippocampal region for recording. Using pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) to induce seizure activity, we observed that menthol, administered at varying doses, significantly reduced the level of epileptiform activity triggered by PTZ. Notably, menthol also demonstrated a protective and inhibitory effect on the proconvulsant action of DMSO, and this effect was dose-dependent. In simpler terms, our findings suggest that menthol has the potential to be used as an additional treatment to prevent seizure activity. This means that incorporating menthol, especially at specific doses, may offer a protective influence against epileptic events. This research sheds light on a promising avenue for potential therapeutic interventions, emphasizing the importance of further exploration of menthol's role in epilepsy prevention. Ultimately, our study opens the door to considering menthol as a valuable component in the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of seizures."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The heterogeneous character of functional gastrointestinal disorders, recently renamed into disorders of gut-brain interaction, makes finding effective treatment options challenging. Compared to synthetic drugs, phytotherapy can have broader pharmacological effects and is often better tolerated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of peppermint oil and caraway oil (POCO) on gastric function and symptom levels in 32 healthy subjects in a single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel design. METHODS: Gastric emptying rate was assessed using a 13C-breath test. Intragastric pressure was measured using high-resolution manometry in fasted state and during intragastric infusion of a nutrient drink (350 mL or until full satiation). GI symptoms were rated on a 100 mm VAS. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. KEY RESULTS: POCO had no effect on intragastric pressure in fasted or fed state (p > 0.08 for all). No significant differences in gastric emptying rate were observed (p = 0.54). In the fasted state, a stronger increase in hunger and decrease in satiety were observed following POCO (p = 0.016 and p = 0.008, respectively). No differences in hunger and satiety were observed in the fed state (p > 0.31 for all). POCO induced less epigastric burning, bloating, and fullness (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Acute POCO administration did not affect gastric function in healthy subjects, but increased fasted hunger ratings. The effects of POCO on gastric function and hunger sensations in patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction, and the contribution to symptom improvement, needs to be elucidated in future studies.",

This randomised controlled study was conducted to investigate the effect of topical menthol applied on the hands and feet of breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy on CIPN symptoms. METHODS: 60 breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=30), which received topical menthol treatment, or a control group (n=30), which received standard care. Both groups continued their routine pharmacological treatments throughout the study. The intervention group applied 1% menthol topically to their hands and feet two times a day. The effect of the intervention on CIPN symptoms was evaluated 3 weeks and 6 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention group showed a significantly greater improvement in CIPN symptoms over time compared with the control group, with an effect size of η2=0.214 for the group×time interaction. Additionally, the intervention group exhibited a notable positive change in the exposure subscale of the CIPN rating scale, with an effect size of η2=0.114. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of menthol significantly mitigates the symptoms of CIPN in breast cancer patients.

      "abstract": "The absorption performance and mechanism of the deep eutectic solvent (DES), composed of menthol and decanoic acid, were investigated. The solubility of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the DES was studied through saturation solution experiments, wherein the solubility of ethane and n-butane increases with a decrease in temperature and increasing pressure. Henry's law constants of ethane and n-butane in the DES at 288.2 K were 2.089 and 0.136 MPa, respectively, demonstrating the high solubility for light hydrocarbons that surpasses or equals that of ionic liquids. The mass transfer and regeneration performance of the DES were investigated by using dynamic bubbling experiments. Results demonstrated that the removal rate of both ethane and n-butane increased as the gas flow rate decreased and the VOC concentration in the model gas increased. Specifically, the removal rate of ethane reached 99.50% at a temperature of 293.2 K, a VOC concentration VOC of 10,000 μmol/mol, and a gas flow rate of 30 mL/min, while the removal rate of n-butane was higher than that of ethane under the same conditions, achieving a removal rate exceeding 99.99%. Furthermore, no significant decrease in the removal rate for n-butane was observed during the four regeneration processes. Interaction energies between the VOC molecule and DES were calculated using the quantum chemistry method. It was found that the interactions between the VOC molecule and DES are primarily attributed to dispersion attractive effects which belong to weak interactions; therefore, the absorption of light hydrocarbon by the DES belongs to a physical process. The DES has been proven to be effective for the recovery of light hydrocarbons, providing a promising approach to address the key challenge in comprehensive treatment of VOCs in the petrochemical industry."

However, the mechanism of menthol inducing extracellular vesicles in leukemic cells is not yet understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of menthol on leukemic extracellular vesicles and their role in apoptosis. NB4 and Molt-4 leukemic cells were cultured with menthol in various concentrations and times. Bioinformatic analysis was used to investigate target proteins of extracellular vesicle and apoptosis, followed by mRNA and protein expression by RT‒PCR and western blotting, respectively. Our findings indicate that menthol inhibits leukemic cell proliferation and increases extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, menthol treated leukemic extracellular vesicles induce apoptosis and upregulate the expression of ATG3 and caspase-3 in both mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that menthol has an antileukemic effect through ATG3 and caspase-3 in apoptosis of leukemic extracellular vesicles."

The bio-enzymes produced from moringa leaves had maximum pectinase activity (287.04 µg of sugar/min/ml) followed by xylanase (87.78 µg of sugar/min/ml) while endoglucanase, exoglucanase and amylase activities were comparatively low. The optimized conditions for HD were 69.08 temperature for 173.70 min with water:sample of 10.0. The optimized conditions for enzyme pre-treatment of mentha leaves by BMHD were enzyme concentration of 8%, for a period of 120 min at an incubation period of 40 ℃. The yield (%) and menthol content (%) of the oil at optimized conditions by HD were 1.55 ml/100 g of sample and 56.40% menthol content, respectively, and for BMHD the yield and menthol content (%) of the oil at optimized conditions were 3.69% and 72.80%, respectively. It was found that BMHD leads to a 130% increase in the yield of mint oil and a 10% increase in menthol content as compared to the HD method. No significant difference in physical parameters was observed in mint oil extracted via both methods. Therefore, BMHD is a cost-effective and sustainable approach having an edge over the HD method without compromising the quality and could be a viable approach for commercial purposes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study examines the impact of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) on gene expression associated with menthol biosynthesis and selected biochemical parameters in peppermint plants (Mentha piperita L.). Menthol, the active ingredient in peppermint, is synthesized through various pathways involving key genes like geranyl diphosphate synthase, menthone reductase, and menthofuran synthase. Seedlings were treated with different concentrations of TiO2NPs (50, 100, 200, and 300 ppm) via foliar spray. After three weeks of treatment, leaf samples were gathered and kept at -70 °C for analysis. RESULTS: According to our findings, there was a significant elevation (P ≤ 0.05) in proline content at concentrations of 200 and 300 ppm in comparison with the control. Specifically, the highest proline level was registered at 200 ppm, reaching 259.64 ± 33.33 µg/g FW. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde content exhibited a decreasing trend following nanoparticle treatments. Catalase activity was notably affected by varying TiO2NP concentrations, with a significant decrease observed at 200 and 300 ppm compared to the control (P ≤ 0.05). Conversely, at 100 ppm, catalase activity significantly increased (11.035 ± 1.12 units/mg of protein/min). Guaiacol peroxidase activity decreased across all nanoparticle concentrations. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis indicated increased expression of the studied genes at 300 ppm concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, it can be inferred that at the transcript level, this nanoparticle exhibited efficacy in influencing the biosynthetic pathway of menthol.",

DESIGN: The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial with an experimental design. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 90 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and met the inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into three groups by randomization program. Patients in the menthol ice and ice popsicle (ice prepared with drinking water only) group were administered menthol ice/ice popsicle (10 mL) twice at 20 minutes intervals. Patients in the control group did not receive any intervention. Routine practices of the clinic were performed by the nurses of the general surgery clinic. Postoperative thirst intensity, severity of dry mouth, bad taste, and bad odor in the mouth were evaluated at 0, 20, and 40 minutes. FINDINGS: No statistically significant difference was found between the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in the control group, menthol ice group, and ice popsicle group (P > .05). A statistically significant difference was found between the 3 groups in terms of thirst intensity and severity of dry mouth at times at the 20th and 40th minutes after the application (P < .01). We found a statistically significant difference between the bad taste and bad odor sensation scores of the patients in the control and intervention groups at the 20th and 40th minutes after the application (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that menthol ice and ice popsicle application are effective strategies to reduce the intensity of thirst, severity of dry mouth, bad taste, and bad odor in postoperative patients.",

      "abstract": "The spread of upper respiratory tract (URT) infections harms people's health and causes social burdens. Developing targeted treatment strategies for URT infections that exhibit good biocompatibility, stability, and strong antimicrobial effects remains challenging. The dual antimicrobial and antiviral effects of iodine (I2) in combination with the cooling sensation of l-menthol in the respiratory tract can simultaneously alleviate URT inflammation symptoms. However, as both I2 and l-menthol are volatile, addressing stability issues is crucial. In this study, a potassium iodide β-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework [β-CD-POF(I)] with appropriate particle size was used to coload and deliver I2 and l-menthol. Primarily, β-CD-POF(I) was employed as the most efficient carrier to significantly enhance the stability of I2, surpassing any other known protection strategies in the pharmaceutical field (CD complexations, PVP conjugations, and cadexomer iodine). The mechanism underlying the improvement in stability of I2 by β-CD-POF(I) was investigated through scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular docking. The results revealed that the key processes involved in improving stability were the inclusion of I2 by β-CD cavities in β-CD-POF(I) and the formation of polyiodide anion between iodine ions and I2. Furthermore, the potential of β-CD-POF(I) to load and deliver drugs was validated, and coloading of l-menthol and I2 demonstrated reliable stability. β-CD-POF(I) achieved a rate of URT deposition ≥95% in vitro, and the combined antibacterial effects of coloaded I2 and l-menthol was better than I2 or PVP-I alone, with no irritation noted following URT administration in rabbits. Therefore, the stable coloading of drugs by β-CD-POF(I), leading to enhanced antimicrobial effects, provides a new strategy for treating URT infections.",

Given its health-promoting properties, including anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities, we tested the disease-alleviating effects of oral menthol in murine campylobacteriosis. Therefore, human gut microbiota-associated IL-10-/- mice were orally subjected to synthetic menthol starting a week before C. jejuni infection and followed up until day 6 post-infection. Whereas menthol pretreatment did not improve campylobacteriosis symptoms, it resulted in reduced colonic C. jejuni numbers and alleviated both macroscopic and microscopic aspects of C. jejuni infection in pretreated mice vs. controls. Menthol pretreatment dampened the recruitment of macrophages, monocytes, and T lymphocytes to colonic sites of infection, which was accompanied by mitigated intestinal nitric oxide secretion. Furthermore, menthol pretreatment had only marginal effects on the human fecal gut microbiota composition during the C. jejuni infection. In conclusion, the results of this preclinical placebo-controlled intervention study provide evidence that menthol application constitutes a promising way to tackle acute campylobacteriosis, thereby reducing the risk for post-infectious complications.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms, and it is associated with several prodromal non-motor symptoms, including an impaired sense of smell, taste and touch. We previously reported that bitter taste impairments occur independently of olfactory impairments in an early-stage PD animal model using short-term intranasal rotenone-treated mice. Cool temperatures also affect bitter taste perception, but it remains unclear whether or not bitter taste impairments result from an altered sensitivity for intraoral cool stimuli. We examined disturbances in the intraoral menthol sensitivity, such as coolness at low concentrations of menthol, using a brief-access test. Once a day, one solution from the 7-concentration series of (-)-menthol (0-2.3 mM) or the bitter taste quinine-HCl (0.3 mM) was randomly presented 20 times for 10 s to water-deprived mice before and 1 week after rotenone treatment. The total number of licks within 20 times was significantly decreased with the presentation of 2.3 mM menthol and quinine-HCl, compared to distilled water in untreated mice, but not in rotenone-treated mice. The correlation between the licks for quinine-HCl and that for menthol was increased after rotenone treatment. In contrast, the 2-bottle choice test for 48 h clarified that menthol sensitivity was increased after rotenone treatment. Furthermore, a thermal place preference test revealed that seeking behavior toward a cold-floored room was increased in the rotenone-treated mice despite the unchanged plantar cutaneous cold sensitivity. These results suggest that taste impairments in this model mice are at least partly due to intraoral somatosensory impairments, accompanied by peripheral/central malfunction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: About 40% of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have already progressed in an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. Development of effective prevention and therapy approaches against NSCLC is critical for reducing mortality. As a fundamental ingredient of peppermint oil, menthol has been demonstrated to possess an antitumor activity in several types of carcinomas. However, the potential role of menthol on NSCLC has not been reported. The present study aims to investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of menthol on proliferation, apoptosis, and mobility of human lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Cell apoptosis was examined by MTT and flow cytometry. The motility of cells was determined by Transwell assay. Western blot analysis was performed to determine expression level of proteins. In vivo model of nude mice was established for evaluating the influence of menthol on tumorigenicity of A549 cells. The expression lentiviral vector of Akt was established in NSCLC cells for further verifying the inhibiting effect of menthol on survival and mobility of NSCLC cells via Akt pathway. RESULTS: The results showed that menthol promoted A549 cell apoptosis, suppressed cell proliferation, and motility by altering the phosphorylated protein level of Akt. Menthol enhanced the expression level of Bax while decreasing expression of Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and MMPs proteins. In vivo experiments suggested that menthol exhibited an inhibitory effect in tumor growth on xenografts. These results were further validated in Akt over-expressed A549 and H1299 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Menthol could display an inhibitory effect on NSCLC cells through Akt signaling pathway, making it a potential target for NSCLC treatment.",

Since antibiotics are usually not indicated in campylobacteriosis, alternative treatment regimens are important. We here investigated potential disease-alleviating effects of menthol and of extracts from tormentil, raspberry leaves, and loosestrife in acute murine campylobacteriosis. Therefore, C. jejuni-infected microbiota-depleted IL-10-/- mice were orally treated with the compounds alone or all in combination from day 2 until day 6 post-infection. Whereas neither treatment regimen affected gastrointestinal pathogen loads, the combination of compounds alleviated C. jejuni-induced diarrheal symptoms in diseased mice on day 6 post-infection. Furthermore, the therapeutic application of tormentil and menthol alone and the combination of the four compounds resulted in lower colonic T cell numbers in infected mice when compared to placebo counterparts. Notably, pro-inflammatory cytokines measured in mesenteric lymph nodes taken from C. jejuni-infected mice following tormentil, menthol, and combination treatment did not differ from basal concentrations. However, neither treatment regimen could dampen extra-intestinal immune responses, including systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion on day 6 post-infection. In conclusion, the combination of menthol and of extracts from tormentil, raspberry leaves, and loosestrife constitutes an antibiotic-independent approach to alleviate campylobacteriosis symptoms."

Many approaches regarding symptomatic relief strategies have been described in the literature, but strategies with cold water and/or menthol are effective in quenching thirst, as they act on pre-absorptive mechanisms. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using menthol popsicles in relieving postoperative thirst in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Material and methods: This is a randomized controlled clinical trial with a quantitative approach. In all, 44 patients were evaluated in the immediate postoperative period of radical prostatectomy, with the intensity and discomfort of thirst being evaluated initially and subsequently. The study consisted of two groups: (1) the placebo group, popsicles without the addition of menthol substrates and (2) the experimental group, popsicles with the addition of 0.05% minty substrates. Results: The results demonstrate that the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were homogeneous at the α = 5% significance level, except the occupation variable. The test detected changes in the intensity and discomfort of thirst in relation to the pre- and post-intervention times for the primary outcome when the groups were analyzed separately and for the interaction of the group versus time, there was no statistical difference between the groups. Conclusion: It was possible to prove that both the menthol popsicle and the popsicle without the addition of menthol were effective in relieving postoperative thirst in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, but there was no statistically significant difference when comparing the two groups.

AIM: In the present study, the effects of menthol on the expression of multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2) and its association with the cytotoxicity of epirubicin (EPI) and cisplatin (CIS) were examined using HepG2 cells. METHODS: The expression levels of target genes were examined by real-time PCR. The intracellular concentration of incorporated EPI was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT analysis. RESULTS: The expression of MRP2 mRNA was increased by exposing HepG2 cells to menthol for 24 hr. Consistent with a previous report suggesting an inverse correlation between MRP2 and Akt behavior, increased expression of MRP2 was also observed on suppression of the Akt function. Intracellular accumulation of EPI was significantly decreased by exposure of HepG2 cells to menthol, and a significant decrease in the intracellular concentration of EPI remaining was observed in HepG2 cells exposed to menthol. The decreased intracellular accumulation of EPI was significantly suppressed by treatment with MK-571, but not verapamil. Both EPI and CIS exerted cytocidal effects on HepG2 cells, but the decrease in cell viability was significantly attenuated by 24-hr menthol pre-exposure. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that menthol causes hepatocellular carcinoma to acquire resistance to anticancer drugs such as EPI and CIS by MRP2 induction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Within professional European competitions, matches can be played in extreme environmental temperatures, ranging from -5 °C to +30 °C in different countries. Furthermore, the World Cups are usually played in the summer months, when temperatures can exceed 35 °C, increasing physiological stress. Practical and cost-effective cooling strategies may be implemented to help players and referees to cope with exercising in the heat. No study has evaluated the effect of non-thermal internal cooling techniques regarding performance responses on elite football referees, so far. This study aims to analyse the effects of a menthol mouth rinse regarding physical, physiological, and perceptual performance in elite male football referees, during a 90-min football protocol in the heat. METHODS: At least thirteen male football referees will be recruited to perform two intermittent football protocols, separated by no less than 7 days. After passing the eligibility criteria, the participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 beverages: (1) intervention - menthol solution 0.01% and (2) placebo - noncaloric berry-flavored solution, both at room temperature. The beverages will be given before warm-up (pre-cooling) and at the half-time (per-cooling). The trials will follow a randomized counterbalanced crossover design, single blinded, and will take place in indoor facilities, with Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) > 30 °C, at the same time of the day to control for circadian variations. IMPACT OF THE PROJECT: The results of this study are expected to determine whether mouth rinsing a menthol solution before and during a football exercise protocol performed in the heat will alter perceptual measures and help ease physiological strain and attenuate performance decrements in elite male football referees, comparing to a non-cooling strategy. Thus, we can be closer to defining nutritional strategies of internal cooling that may be an advantage for the performance of the football referees in the heat.

BACKGROUND: Menthol has achieved good results in quenching thirst in patients in intensive care units, but its safety and reliability in perioperative fasting patients are unknown. DESIGN: A systematic review with meta-analysis of intervention studies was performed. DATA SOURCES: We used Chinese and English databases from their dates of inception to May 2022. Literature was retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINHAL, SinoMed, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP database. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently examined the records according to the eligibility criteria and extracted the data of each included study. RESULTS: A total of seven studies were identified in this review, which included 537 surgical patients. Overall, menthol reduced thirst intensity in surgical patients and decreased thirst discomfort. Further subgroup analysis revealed that the menthol intervention significantly improved thirst intensity in surgical patients during preoperative and postoperative fasting periods. The Egger's tests showed no significant bias (p = 0.113 and 0.553, thirst intensity and thirst discomfort, respectively). CONCLUSION: Menthol intervention effectively improved thirst intensity and thirst discomfort during fasting in surgical patients, but more large-scale, multicentre randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these findings further.",

      "abstract": "Topically applied compounds containing camphor and menthol have been used to alleviate pain, cold symptoms, and pruritus, historically predominantly in East Asia. Being not studied well, they are less recognized in Western medicine. Given the commonality of pain, pruritus, and cold symptoms in addition to the growing need for non-opioid treatment options, the authors investigated clinical applications of such compounds for their over-counter usage. The purpose was to analyze current clinical research and applications regarding the use of these topical agents. This study involved a bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed articles, published in English and indexed in PubMed from 2010 to 2022, pertaining to camphor- and menthol-containing compounds. There were 103 results, of which 15 (14.6%) articles were related to the treatment of disorders related to health, such as upper respiratory infection, pain, and pruritus. Excluded were \"non-research\" articles (e.g., letters to the editor), articles that do not involve human subjects, reports of improper application or misuse (e.g., ingestion), and articles pertaining to intraoral, intranasal, and ophthalmic agents. Of these articles, the originating journals, respective journal impact factor scores, publication years, study designs, and study topics were identified. Underlying trends and themes regarding clinically relevant research on these compounds were subsequently discerned. Based on this analysis, topical agents containing camphor and menthol are potentially effective at treating pain, upper respiratory infection symptoms, and pruritus in addition to potentially functioning as an antimicrobial. However, with a limited number of studies addressing these compounds' uses in each application, no definitive recommendation can be made regarding their use. Given the promising results of earlier studies, the authors recommend that more primary research, particularly randomized, double-blind controlled studies, be done regarding clinical applications of these substances."

The current purpose was to determine the thermoregulatory and perceptual effects of topical menthol application prior to walking in the heat. METHODS: Twelve participants walked (1.6 m s-1, 5% grade) for 30 min in the heat (38 °C, 60% relative humidity) with either a 4% menthol or control gel on the upper (shoulder to wrist) and lower (mid-thigh to ankle) limbs. Skin blood flow (SkBF), sweat (rate, composition), skin conductivity, heart rate, temperature (skin, core), and thermal perception were measured prior to and during exercise. RESULTS: Skin conductivity expressed as time to 10, 20, 30, and 40 µS was delayed due to menthol (559 ± 251, 770 ± 292, 1109 ± 301, 1299 ± 335 s, respectively) compared to the control (515 ± 260, 735 ± 256, 935 ± 300, 1148 ± 298 s, respectively, p = 0.048).

Core temperature did not differ at baseline between the menthol (37.4 ± 0.3 °C) and control (37.3 ± 0.4 °C, p = 0.298) but was higher at 10, 20, and 30 min due to menthol (37.5 ± 0.3, 37.7 ± 0.2, 38.1 ± 0.3 °C, respectively) compared to the control (37.3 ± 0.4, 37.4 ± 0.3, 37.7 ± 0.3 °C, respectively, p < 0.05). The largest rise in core temperature from baseline was at 30 min during menthol (0.7 ± 0.3 °C) compared to the control (0.4 ± 0.2 °C, p = 0.004).

BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) can be induced by general anesthesia. Several drugs are available to reduce the risk of PONV; however, their cost and side effects limit their clinical use. METHOD: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial that included 60 children aged 7-18 years who underwent an appendectomy at the Pediatric Surgery Clinic of a tertiary hospital between April and June 2022. Data for this study were collected via the developed information form, which included participants' descriptive characteristics and bowel function parameters, and the Baxter Retching Faces (BARF) nausea scale. Children in the study group who underwent an appendectomy were given chewing gum and asked to chew it for an average of 15 min, whereas those in the control group received no intervention. RESULTS: The BARF nausea score measured during the menthol gum chewing period was lower in the study group, and the difference score value calculated after pretest time was higher in the study group, as expected (p < 0.001). Moreover, menthol gum chewing was found to shorten hospital stay by 1 day (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Menthol gum chewing reduced the severity of postoperative nausea and length of hospital stay. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Chewing gum can be used as a nonpharmacological method by pediatric nurses in clinical practice to reduce the severity of postoperative nausea and length of hospital stay.",

METHODS: FEL solid nanoparticles were obtained by bead milling of FEL powder (microparticles), and a topical formulation (FEL-NP gel) consisting of 1.5% FEL solid nanoparticles), 2% carboxypolymethylene, 2% l-menthol, 0.5% methylcellulose, and 5% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (w/w %) were prepared. RESULTS: The particle size of FEL nanoparticles was 20-200 nm. The released FEL concentration from FEL-NP gel was significantly higher than that from FEL gel without bead mill treatment (carboxypolymethylene gel in which FEL microparticles (MPs) instead of FEL nanoparticles were incorporated, FEL-MP gel), and FEL was released as nanoparticles from the gel. Moreover, both transdermal penetration and percutaneous absorption of FEL-NP gel were significantly increased compared with those of FEL-MP gel, and the area under the FEL concentration-time curve (AUC) of FEL-NP gels was 1.52- and 1.38-fold of commercially available FEL ointment and FEL-MP gel, respectively. In addition, after 24 h of treatment, the FEL content in rat skin treated with FEL-NP gels was 1.38- and 2.54-fold higher than that when treated with commercially available FEL ointment and FEL-MP gel, respectively. Moreover, the enhanced skin penetration of FEL-NP gels was significantly attenuated by inhibition of energy-dependent endocytosis, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully prepared a topically applied carboxypolymethylene gel containing FEL nanoparticles. In addition, we observed that the endocytosis pathway was mainly related to the high skin penetration of FEL nanoparticles, and FEL-NP gel application resulted in high local tissue concentration and systemic absorption of FEL. These findings provide useful information for the design of topically applied nanoformulations against inflammation by providing local and systemic effects."

      "abstract": "Menthol cigarettes have had a profound adverse effect on public health. On 1 June 2020, Massachusetts became the first state to ban the sale of menthol cigarettes. We explored how perceptions of the ban and smoking behaviors changed over time among a group of 27 individuals who smoked menthol cigarettes at our safety-net hospital. In a convergent mixed methods study, we administered questionnaires and interviews simultaneously at two timepoints: 1 month pre-ban and 6 months post-ban. Pre-ban, we assessed perceptions of the ban and anticipated smoking behaviors after the ban. Post-ban, we assessed participants' actual smoking behaviors and elicited suggestions to avoid unintended consequences that might undermine intended policy effects. Several respondents perceived the Massachusetts ban as positive because it could promote smoking cessation, prevent youth initiation, and mitigate unfair targeting of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Others perceived the ban as an overreach of government policy, financially motivated, and unfairly targeting the Black community. Many continued to smoke menthol cigarettes obtained outside Massachusetts. Individuals suggested promoting tobacco treatment for people affected by the ban and a national ban to circumvent out-of-state purchasing of menthol cigarettes. Our findings suggest that in order to be most effective, healthcare systems must promote tobacco treatment and ensure that treatment is accessible to all individuals affected by the ban.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Massachusetts was the first to implement a state-wide menthol cigarette sales restriction in the USA. Following its implementation in June 2020, evidence showed declines in cigarette sales in Massachusetts; however, changes in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) product sales are unknown. METHODS: This cohort study analysed NRT products sold by US-based retailers available in 26 states from the Nielsen Retail Scanner Data. Outcomes were state-level 4-week aggregate sales of gum, lozenge and patch NRT products converted into pieces per 1000 adults (aged ≥18 years) who smoke cigarettes based on smoking rates from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and corresponding population from the US Census Bureau. We used a difference-in-differences method to compare changes in NRT product sales in Massachusetts before (1 January 2017 to 13 June 2020) and after (14 June 2020 to 4 December 2021) the policy with sales in 25 states. RESULTS: The analysis included 1664 observations for each NRT product, with 1170 from before and 494 from after the policy change. The 4-week NRT product sales per 1000 adults who smoke cigarettes in Massachusetts compared with the comparison states increased for gums by 643.11 (95% CI 365.33 to 920.89; p<0.001) pieces or 12.9% and for lozenges by 436.97 (95% CI 292.88 to 581.06; p<0.001) pieces or 17.9% but no statistically significant change in patches after implementing the policy. CONCLUSION: The increases in sales of gum and lozenge NRT products in Massachusetts after implementing the policy suggest that a nationwide ban on menthol cigarettes can increase NRT product use; therefore, interventions are needed to strengthen cessation support for adults who smoke cigarettes but intend to quit.",

      "abstract": "Since 2017, the Vermont Tobacco Control Program (VTCP) has worked to reduce the impact of flavored tobacco products on Vermonters. With the proposed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules banning menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars and proposed legislation banning sales of all menthol and flavored tobacco products in Vermont, VTCP prioritized resources to support cessation among Vermonters who use menthol tobacco products. In March 2021, VTCP began offering a tailored quitline protocol for adults who use menthol tobacco, including financial incentives, for completed coaching sessions. From March 2021 to May 2022, 66 quitline callers enrolled in the menthol incentive protocol, representing 8% of all quitline callers and 25% of participants in the state's quitline incentive programs. A greater proportion of callers in the menthol incentive program completed three or more quitline calls (58% vs. 38%) and enrolled in phone and text support (61% vs. 32%). Quitline callers enrolled in any incentive protocols (menthol, Medicaid/uninsured, or pregnant) were more likely to request one or two forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Quitlines remain an effective, evidence-based method of tobacco cessation, especially in reaching vulnerable populations. Given the targeted marketing of menthol brands to Black and African American populations, LGBTQ+ populations, youth, and neighborhoods with lower incomes, addressing menthol cigarette use is key to improving health equity and health of Vermonters. Early data indicates that the use of financial incentives can increase engagement with a state quitline among menthol tobacco users through greater completion of cessation coaching calls, enrollment in text message support, and NRT usage.",

      "abstract": "Tunica dartos smooth muscle (TDSM) lies beneath the scrotal skin, and its contraction leads to scrotum wrinkling upon cooling. However, neither the nature of TDSM cold-sensitivity nor the underlying molecular sensors are well understood. Here we have investigated the role of cold/menthol-sensitive TRPM8 channel in TDSM temperature-dependent contractility. The contraction of isolated male rat TDSM strips was studied by tensiometry. TRPM8 expression was assayed by RT-PCR and fluorescence immunochemistry. Isolated TDSM strips responded to cooling from 33 °C to 20 °C by enhancement of basal tension, and increase of the amplitude and duration of electric field stimulated (EFS) contractions. The effects of cold on basal tension, but not on EFS-contractions, could be 80% inhibited by TRPM8 blockers, capsazepine and BCTC [N-(4‑tert-butylphenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)piperazine-1-carboxamide], and could be partially mimicked by menthol. RT-PCR and immunolabeling showed TRPM8 mRNA and protein expression in TDSM cells with protein labelling being predominantly localized to intracellular compartments. Chemical castration of male rats consequent to the treatment with androgen receptor blocker, flutamide, led to the abrogation of cold effects on TDSM basal tension, but not on EFS-contractions, and to the disappearance of TRPM8 protein expression. We conclude that TRPM8 is involved in the maintenance of basal cold-induced TDSM tonus, but not in sympathetic nerve-mediated contractility, by acting as endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel whose expression in TDSM cells requires the presence of a functional androgen receptor. Thus, TRPM8 plays a crucial role in scrotal thermoregulation which is important for maintaining normal spermatogenesis and male fertility."

The current study examined the protective benefits of menthol topical treatment on T-2 toxin-induced cutaneous toxicity in mice. Lesions were observed on the skin of the T-2 toxin-treated groups at 72 and 120 h. The T-2 toxin (2.97 mg/kg/bw)-treated group developed skin lesions, skin inflammation, erythema, and necrosis of skin tissue in contrast to the control group. Our findings reveal that topical application of 0.25% and 0.5% MN treated groups resulted in no erythema or inflammation, and normal skin was observed with growing hairs. The 0.5% MN administered group demonstrated an 80% blister and erythema healing effect in in vitro tests. In addition, MN dose-dependently suppressed ROS and lipid peroxidation mediated by the T-2 toxin up to 120%. Histology discoveries and the immunoblotting investigations with the downregulation of i-NOS gene expression confirmed the validity of menthol activity. Further molecular docking experiments of menthol against the i-NOS protein demonstrated stable binding efficacy with conventional hydrogen bond interactions, indicating compelling evidence of menthol's anti-inflammatory effects on the T-2 toxin-induced skin inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Menthol, a widely used natural, active compound, has recently been shown to have anticancer activity. Moreover, it has been found to have a promising future in the treatment of various solid tumors. Therefore, using literature from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Ovid, ScienceDirect, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases, the present study reviewed the anticancer activity of menthol and the underlying mechanism. Menthol has a good safety profile and exerts its anticancer activity via multiple pathways and targets. As a result, it has gained popularity for significantly inhibiting different types of cancer cells by various mechanisms such as induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, disruption of tubulin polymerization, and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Owing to the excellent anticancer activity menthol has demonstrated, further research is warranted for developing it as a novel anticancer agent. However, there are limitations and gaps in the current research on menthol, and its antitumor mechanism has not been completely elucidated. It is expected that more basic experimental and clinical studies focusing on menthol and its derivatives will eventually help in its clinical application as a novel anticancer agent."

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sterile ice water versus menthol spray in ICU fasted children, to provide insights to the clinical care of fasted children. METHODS: The children admitted to the ICU of our hospital from June 1, 2021 to August 31, 2022 and needed to fast were included. Children were randomly assigned to the ice water group or menthol group. We evaluated and compared the thirst distress scale (TDS), oral mucosa wetness scale (OMWS), children medical fear scale (CMFS), numerical rating scale (NRS), unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) flow rate between 2 groups. RESULTS: A total of 139 children were included, involving 69 children in ice water group and 70 children in menthol group. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics, TDS, OMWS, OMWS, CMFS, and NRS score, UWS flow rate before intervention between ice water group and menthol group (all P > .05). After intervention, the TDS, OMWS, NRS score of menthol group was statistically less than that of ice water group (all P < .05), the UWS flow rate of menthol group was statistically higher than that of ice water group (P = .034). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ice water spray, menthol spray may be more beneficial to relieve the thirst and increase the comfort in ICU fasted children. Future studies with larger sample size and rigorous design are needed to evaluate the effects and safety of ice water and menthol spray in the nursing care of children.",

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: The study was a single-centre, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: This study included 119 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery in a training and research hospital. Patients in the intervention group (n = 59) received menthol lozenges at 30, 60, and 90 min after extubation. Patients in the control group (n = 60) received standard care and treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of the study was the change in post-extubation thirst assessed by Visual Analogue Scale after using menthol lozenges compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes were changes in post-extubation physiological parameters and nausea severity assessed by Visual Analogue Scale compared to baseline, and comfort level assessed with Shortened General Comfort Questionnaire. RESULTS: Between-group comparisons showed that the intervention group had significantly lower thirst scores at all time points and nausea at the first assessment (p < 0.05) and significantly higher comfort scores (p < 0.05) than the control group. There were no significant differences between the groups in physiological parameters at baseline or any of the postoperative assessments (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, the use of menthol lozenges effectively increased comfort level by reducing post-extubation thirst and nausea, but had no effect on physiological parameters. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses should be vigilant for complaints such as thirst, nausea, and discomfort in patients after extubation. Nurses' administration of menthol lozenges to patients may help reduce post-extubation thirst, nausea, and discomfort.",

In healthy mammals, irritant-evoked pulmonary-cardiac reflexes cause parasympathetic-mediated bradycardia. However, in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats, irritant inhalation also increases sympathetic drive to the heart. This remodeled pulmonary-cardiac reflex may contribute to cardiovascular risk caused by inhalation of air pollutants/irritants in susceptible individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous studies have shown that the cooling mimic l-menthol, an agonist for the cold-sensitive transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), can alleviate nasal inflammatory symptoms and respiratory reflexes evoked by irritants. Here, we investigated the impact of inhalation of TRPM8 agonists l-menthol and WS-12 on pulmonary-cardiac reflexes evoked by inhalation of the irritant allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) using radiotelemetry. l-Menthol, but not its inactive analog d-menthol, significantly reduced the AITC-evoked reflex tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in SH rats but had no effect on the AITC-evoked bradycardia in either SH or normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. WS-12 reduced AITC-evoked tachycardia and PVCs in SH rats, but this more potent TRPM8 agonist also reduced AITC-evoked bradycardia. l-Menthol had no effect on heart rate when given alone, whereas WS-12 evoked a minor bradycardia in WKY rats. We conclude that stimulation of TRPM8-expressing afferents within the airways reduces irritant-evoked pulmonary-cardiac reflexes, especially the aberrant reflex tachyarrhythmia in SH rats. Airway menthol treatment may be an effective therapy for reducing pollution-associated CV exacerbations.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Irritant-evoked pulmonary-cardiac reflexes are remodeled in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats-causing de novo sympathetic reflexes that drive tachyarrhythmia. This remodeling may contribute to air pollution-associated risk in susceptible individuals with cardiovascular disease. We found that inhalation of TRPM8 agonists, l-menthol and WS-12, but not the inactive analog d-menthol, selectively reduces the reflex tachyarrhythmia evoked by allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) inhalation in SH rats. Use of menthol may protect susceptible individuals from pollution-associated CV exacerbations.",

      "abstract": "Effective antimicrobial treatment has been identified as a serious and unmet medical need. Herein, we present a strategy based on deep eutectic systems (DES) to overcome current limitations, answering the need not only to effectively kill bacterial agents but also to avoid their adhesion and proliferation, which is associated with biofilm formation and have a crucial impact on bacterial virulence. To achieve such a goal, natural deep eutectic systems (NADES) based on menthol (Me) and saturated free fatty acids (FFA) were produced, fully physicochemical characterized, and its bioactive properties were described. The antimicrobial potential of menthol-based NADES with FFA, namely, myristic acid (MA), lauric acid (LA), and stearic acid (SA) were investigated towards a broad panel of microorganisms. The obtained data indicates that NADES possess effective antimicrobial properties towards the Gram-positive bacterial and fungal strains tested. Among the tested formulations, Me:LA at a molar ratio of 4:1 molar was used to carry out a biofilm detachment/removal assay due to is superior microbiological properties. This formulation was able to effectively lead to biofilm removal/dispersion of not only methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Candida albicans, but also Escherichia coli, without the need of any additional physical force or antibiotic. Furthermore, since microbial invasion and biofilm formation is highly undesired in wound healing, namely in chronic wound healing, the wound healing properties of these eutectic formulations was also investigated. The results suggest that these NADES can cope with microbial invasion and biofilm detachment while not compromising normal keratinocyte proliferation and migration verified in wound healing and epidermis repair, while also contributing to the reduction of cell stress and inflammation via the control of ROS production. In conclusion, these results provide the indication that NADES based on Me and FFA holds great interest as antimicrobial agents for preventive and therapeutic applications in various clinical settings, including wound healing.",

Through the phenotypic screen, we here identify L-menthol that ameliorates psoriasis-like skin inflammation by increasing protein phosphatase 6 in keratinocytes. Target identification approaches reveal an indispensable role for the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 in governing the protein phosphatase 6-upregulating function of L-menthol in keratinocytes. The transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 is diminished in the epidermis of psoriasis patients and imiquimod-induced mouse model, while L-menthol upregulates the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 by preventing its proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1 transcriptionally activates the expression of immunoglobulin-binding protein 1 which promotes protein phosphatase 6 expression and inhibits its ubiquitination. Collectively, we discover a therapeutic compound, L-menthol, for psoriasis, and uncover the dysfunctional the transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split 1- immunoglobulin-binding protein 1- protein phosphatase 6 axis that contributes to psoriasis pathology by using L-menthol as a probe.",

      "abstract": "Menthol is an important flavoring additive that triggers a cooling sensation. Under physiological condition, low to moderate concentrations of menthol activate transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) in the primary nociceptors, such as dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and trigeminal ganglion, generating a cooling sensation, whereas menthol at higher concentration could induce cold allodynia, and cold hyperalgesia mediated by TRPM8 sensitization. In addition, the paradoxical irritating properties of high concentrations of menthol is associated with its activation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1). Under pathological situation, menthol activates TRPM8 to attenuate mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia following nerve injury or chemical stimuli. Recent reports have recapitulated the requirement of central group II/III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) with endogenous κ-opioid signaling pathways for menthol analgesia. Additionally, blockage of sodium channels and calcium influx is a determinant step after menthol exposure, suggesting the possibility of menthol for pain management. In this review, we will also discuss and summarize the advances in menthol-related drugs for pathological pain treatment in clinical trials, especially in neuropathic pain, musculoskeletal pain, cancer pain and postoperative pain, with the aim to find the promising therapeutic candidates for the resolution of pain to better manage patients with pain in clinics."

      "abstract": "Lopinavir is effective in treatment of HIV infection but experiences low oral bioavailability due to poor solubility, pre-systemic metabolism, and P-gp intestinal efflux. Co-processing with menthol enhanced its dissolution and intestinal permeability. Niosomes comprising Span 60, cholesterol, and poloxamer 407 were formulated in absence and presence of menthol. These were evaluated for size, morphology, entrapment efficiency (EE%), lopinavir release, and intestinal absorption. The later employed in situ rabbit intestinal absorption model. Niosomes were spherical with vesicle size of 140.2 ± 23 and 148.2 ± 27 nm for standard and menthol containing niosomes, respectively. The EE% values were 94.4% and 96.3% for both formulations, respectively. Niosomes underwent slow release during the time course of absorption with menthol hastening lopinavir release, but the release did not exceed 9%. Niosmoal encapsulation enhanced lopinavir intestinal absorption compared with drug solution. This was reflected from the fraction absorbed from duodenum, which was 24.15%, 73.09%, and 83.23% for solution, standard niosomes and menthol containing vesicles, respectively. These values were 34.32%, 80.8%, and 86.56% for the same formulations in case of jejuno-ileum. Lopinavir absorption from niosomes did not depend on release supporting intact vesicle absorption. The study introduced menthol containing niosomes as carriers for enhanced lopinavir intestinal absorption.",

      "abstract": "Burdens related to pain, smoking/nicotine dependence, and pain-smoking comorbidity disproportionately impact Black Americans, and menthol cigarette use is overrepresented among Black adults who smoke cigarettes. Menthol may increase nicotine exposure, potentially conferring enhanced acute analgesia and driving greater dependence. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to examine associations between pain, menthol cigarette use, and nicotine dependence. Data was drawn from Black adults who were current cigarette smokers (n = 1370) at Wave 5 (2018-2019) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. Nicotine dependence was assessed using the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives. ANCOVA revealed that moderate/severe pain (vs. no/low pain) was associated with greater overall nicotine dependence (p < .001) and greater negative reinforcement, cognitive enhancement, and affiliative attachment smoking motives (ps < .001). Menthol smokers with moderate/severe pain also endorsed greater cigarette craving and tolerance, compared to non-menthol smokers with no/low pain (ps < .05). Findings support the notion that among Black individuals who smoke cigarettes, the presence of moderate/severe pain (vs. no/low pain) and menthol use may engender greater physical indices of nicotine dependence relative to non-menthol use. Compared to no/low pain, moderate/severe pain was associated with greater emotional attachment to smoking and greater proclivity to smoke for reducing negative affect and enhancing cognitive function. Clinical implications include the need to address the role of pain and menthol cigarette use in the assessment and treatment of nicotine dependence, particularly among Black adults. These data may help to inform evolving tobacco control policies aimed at regulating or banning menthol tobacco additives.",

Menthol (100 mg/kg) was given intragastric 2 h after CLP. Blood samples and liver tissues were collected 24 h after surgery. Menthol significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated the sepsis-induced elevation in serum liver enzymes and improved the hepatic histopathological changes. Menthol treatment significantly (p < 0.05) decreased hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, malondialdehyde, total nitrite, and cleaved caspase-3. It restored the hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione. Additionally, menthol significantly (p < 0.05) increased hepatic levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2); an anti-apoptotic factor, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a biomarker of regeneration and survival.

Herein, we innovatively propose a menthol nanoliposome (Men-nanoLips) that can dramatically increase lymph node accumulation of the dendritic cell (DC)-based anti-tumor vaccines. Specifically, Men-nanoLips efficiently enhanced lymphatic endothelial cell (EC) barrier permeability by reducing the expression of tight junction proteins. And interestingly, Men-nanoLips not only up-regulated the expression of CCR7 in DCs but also increased the secretion of CCL21 in lymphatic ECs. Moreover, Men-nanoLips promoted DC vaccine maturation as evidenced by increasing the expression of costimulatory molecules and up-regulating the pseudopodia-like protein. With those complementary mechanisms provided by Men-nanoLips, the number of the B16 whole-tumor cell lysate-loaded DCs that target the draining LN enhanced remarkably and significantly boosted the treatment efficacy of DC anti-tumor vaccines. Therefore, we concluded that Men-nanoLips could be instructive for increasing LN homing of DC vaccines.",

While extensive research has investigated the effectiveness of various cooling strategies, including cold water immersion and ice-suit, there has been little work focused on overcoming the cutaneous vasoconstriction response to external cold stimulation, which can reduce the effectiveness of these treatments. Over-the-counter (OTC) topical analgesics have been utilized for the treatment of muscle pain for decades; however, to date no research has examined the possibility of taking advantage of their vasodilatory functions in the context of skin cooling. We tested whether an OTC analgesic cream containing 20% methyl salicylate and 6% L-menthol, known cutaneous vasodilators, applied to the skin during skin cooling accelerates heat loss in exercise-induced hyperthermia. Firstly, we found that cutaneous application of OTC topical analgesic cream can attenuate cold-induced vasoconstriction and enhance heat loss during local skin cooling. We also revealed that core body heat loss, as measured by an ingestible telemetry sensor, could be accelerated by cutaneous application of analgesic cream during ice-suit cooling in exercise-induced hyperthermia. A blunted blood pressure response was observed during cooling with the analgesic cream application. Given the safety profile and affordability of topical cutaneous analgesics containing vasodilatory agents, our results suggest that they can be an effective and practical tool for enhancing the cooling effects of skin cooling for hyperthermia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: No reports exist as to neuroprotective effects associated with topical activation of transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), a noted cold receptor. In the present study, we identified whether activating peripheral TRPM8 can be an adjuvant therapy for ischemic stroke. METHODS: Menthol, an agonist of TRPM8, was applied orally or topically to all paws or back of the mouse after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We used Trpm8 gene knockout (Trpm8-/-) mice or TRPM8 antagonist and lidocaine to validate the roles of TRPM8 and peripheral nerve conduction in menthol against ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Application of menthol 16% to paw derma attenuated infarct volumes and ameliorated sensorimotor deficits in stroke mice induced by MCAO. The benefits of topically applied menthol were associated with reductions in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and infiltration of monocytes and macrophages in ischemic brains. Antagonizing TRPM8 or Trpm8 knockout dulls the neuroprotective effects of topically application of menthol against MCAO. Immunohistochemistry analyses revealed significantly higher TRPM8 expression in skin tissue samples obtained from the paws compared with skin from the backs, which was reflected by significantly smaller infarct lesion volumes and better sensorimotor function in mice treated with menthol on the paws compared with the back. Blocking conduction of peripheral nerve in the four paws reversed the neuroprotective effects of topical menthol administrated to paws. On the other hand, oral menthol dosing did not assist with recovery from MCAO in our study. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that activation of peripheral TRPM8 expressed in the derma tissue of limbs with sufficient concentration of menthol is beneficial to stroke recovery. Topical application of menthol on hands and feet could be a novel and simple-to-use therapeutic strategy for stroke patients.",

      "abstract": "Lopinavir is an antiretroviral, antiparasitic agent and recently utilized in treatment of COVID-19. Unfortunately, lopinavir exhibited poor oral bioavailability due to poor dissolution, extensive pre-systemic metabolism, and significant P-glycoprotein intestinal efflux. Accordingly, the aim was to enhance dissolution rate and intestinal absorption of lopinavir. This employed co-processing with menthol which is believed to modify crystalline structures and inhibit intestinal efflux. Lopinavir was mixed with menthol at different molar ratios before ethanol assisted kneading. Formulations were evaluated using FTIR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and dissolution studies. Optimum ratio was utilized to assess lopinavir intestinal permeability. This employed in situ rabbit intestinal perfusion technique. FTIR, DSC and XRD indicated formation of lopinavir-menthol co-crystals at optimum molar ratio of 1:2. Additional menthol underwent phase separation due to possible self-association. Co-crystallization significantly enhanced lopinavir dissolution rate compared with pure drug to increase the dissolution efficiency from 24.96% in case of unprocessed lopinavir to 91.43% in optimum formulation. Lopinavir showed incomplete absorption from duodenum and jejuno-iliac segments with lower absorptive clearance from jejuno-ileum reflecting P-gp efflux. Co-perfusion with menthol increased lopinavir intestinal permeability. The study introduced menthol as co-crystal co-former for enhanced dissolution and augmented intestinal absorption of lopinavir."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 9,2% of the global population and places a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Most medications for treating IBS, including spasmolytics, laxatives, and antidiarrheals, have low efficacy. Effective and safe therapeutic treatments have yet to be developed for IBS. PURPOSE: This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a food supplement containing standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol in human participants with IBS or IBS/functional dyspepsia (FD). DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: We randomly assigned 56 patients with IBS or IBS/FD to an intervention group (Group 1) or control group (Group 2) that were given supplement or placebo, respectively, in addition to the standard treatment regimen for 30 d. Three outpatient visits were conducted during the study. Symptom severity was measured at each visit using a 7×7 questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the intestinal microbiota were assessed at visits 1 and 3 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: At visit 1 (before treatment), the median total 7×7 questionnaire score was in the moderately ill range for both groups, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.1). At visit 2, the total 7×7 score decreased to mildly ill, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.4). At visit 3, the total score for group 1 indicated borderline illness and for group 2 remained indicated mild illness (p = 0.009). Even though we observed some variations in gut microbiota between the groups, we did not find any statistically significant changes. CONCLUSION: The food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content increased the efficacy of standard therapy in IBS and FD patients. The use of the supplement did not cause any obvious side effects. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04484467.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Menthol may make cigarette smoke less aversive and could lead youth to smoke more frequently and become more dependent on nicotine. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of menthol use with cigarette smoking frequency and nicotine dependence (ND) among youth cigarettes users. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used a pooled sample of cohorts of US youth (aged 12-17 years at their baseline and follow-up interviews) in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (September 2013 to November 2019). Household interviews were conducted using audio computer-assisted self-interviews. US youth who were past-30-day cigarette smokers at any of wave 2 through wave 5, completed the preceding survey (eg, wave 2 past-30-day cigarette smokers completed wave 1), and indicated whether they used menthol cigarettes were eligible. The association of menthol use with smoking frequency and ND was estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting adjusted mean differences (aMDs), adjusted risk ratios (aRRs), and corresponding 95% CIs. Data were analyzed from December 2021 to March 2022. EXPOSURES: Menthol use and transitions in use (switching to or from menthol cigarettes). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were the number of days smoked in the past 30 days, the risk of frequent smoking (smoking ≥20 days in the past 30 days), and symptoms of ND. RESULTS: There were a total of 1492 observations among 1096 US youth cigarette smokers, of whom 49.4% were female, 67.2% were non-Hispanic White, and 28.7% were aged 12 to 14 years at their baseline survey (all percentages are weighted). Among those who switched from not smoking to smoking (61% of the sample), menthol use was associated with smoking on 3.1 additional days (aMD; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.2 days), 59% higher risk of being a frequent smoker (aRR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.06), and 10% higher ND scores (aMD, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.17). Switching from smoking menthol to smoking nonmenthol (vs maintaining menthol use) was associated with smoking on 3.6 fewer days (aMD; 95% CI, -6.3 to -0.9 days) and 47% lower risk of being a frequent smoker (aRR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.92). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the addition of menthol to cigarettes is associated with increased smoking frequency and ND among US youth.",

In this work, inspired by the intrinsic property that the expression of thermo-resistant heat shock proteins (HSPs) is highly dependent with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), dual-functionalized diclofenac (DC) with anti-inflammation and glycolysis-inhibition abilities was successfully co-encapsulated with phase-change dl-menthol (DLM) in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (DC/DLM@PLGA NPs) to realize improved HIFU surgery without causing adverse inflammation. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the great potential of DC/DLM@PLGA NPs for serving as an efficient synergistic agent for HIFU surgery, which can not only amplify HIFU ablation efficacy through DLM vaporization-induced energy deposition but also simultaneously sensitize tumor cells to hyperthermia by glycolysis inhibition as well as diminished inflammation. Thus, our study provides an efficient strategy for simultaneously improving the curative efficiency and diminishing the harmful inflammatory responses of clinical HIFU surgery.",

Methods: Twelve recreational male runners (age: 31.7 ± 3.8 years; age range: 27-39 years) completed a familiarization, a control test (CON) and two maximal 10-km time trials (counterbalanced randomized crossover design) performed in different days with a non-thermal cooling intervention (combined application of a L-menthol mouth rinse and topical L-menthol gel - MEN) or placebo (PLA). Performance and perceptual measures (thermal sensation, thermal comfort, ratings of perceived exertion and affective response) were recorded for every km completed in the 10-km test. Results: Performance time was lower in MEN (P = 0.03) and PLA (P = 0.003) compared to CON, but no differences were found between MEN vs PLA (P = 1.00). All perceptual responses increased over time in all conditions (P < 0.0001), but only the thermal sensation was lower (P = 0.01) in the MEN compared to CON. Conclusion: L-menthol strategies promote fresh sensations and may improve running performance in 10-km time trial in recreational runners, but the performance improvement could mainly be due to a placebo effect.",

A recent 20-year prospective study revealed an association between moderate to high frequency of Finnish sauna bathing and a lower incidence of dementia and AD, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these benefits remain uncertain. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sauna-like conditions could lower tau phosphorylation by increasing body temperature. We observed a decrease in tau phosphorylation in wild-type and hTau mice as well as in neuron-like cells when exposed to higher temperatures. These effects were correlated with specific changes in phosphatase and kinase activities, but not with inflammatory or heat shock responses. We also used a drug strategy to promote thermogenesis: topical application of menthol, which led to a sustained increase in body temperature in hTau mice, concomitant with a significant decrease in tau phosphorylation. Our results suggest that sauna-like conditions or menthol treatment could lower tau pathology through mild hyperthermia, and may provide promising therapeutic strategies for AD and other tauopathies.",

Two follow-up studies were conducted to evaluate patient satisfaction, self-regulated dosing, and long-term safety data: FDACT, Functional Dyspepsia Adherence and Compliance Trial, and FDSU36, Functional Dyspepsia Safety Update at 36 months. METHODS: A patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire was designed and distributed online to assess real-world satisfaction and dosing frequency of open-label COLM-SST in patients with FD. A separate study analyzing voluntary safety surveillance data evaluated the frequency and severity of reported adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: A total of 600 FD patients were enrolled in the PRO study. Ninety five percent of respondents reported a major or moderate improvement in their FD symptoms and 91.7% indicated a major or moderate improvement in quality of life (QOL) using COLM-SST. Between 1 and 4 capsules were consumed daily by 91.2% of respondents, with 56.2% taking them before meals. Symptom relief was rapid, with 86.4% of respondents indicating relief within 2 h of taking COLM-SST. Few adverse events (AEs) were reported (0.0187%) by patients using COLM-SST. No serious AEs were identified. CONCLUSION: COLM-SST is safe, well tolerated, and provides rapid relief of FD symptoms. These findings, demonstrated in the FDREST trial, were further supported by a large prospective PRO study evaluating self-regulated dosing frequency, symptom improvement, and QOL. COLM-SST was well-tolerated based on review of AE data at 36 months.",

Six individual different terpenes these are: (±)-menthol, B-citronellol, ( + )-3-carene, (R)- ( + )- limonene, citronella oil and orange terpenes. The results revealed significant differences between the terpenes used on the olfactory response on this insect, in that half of the compounds were very attractive while the other half were repellant to them. This behavior study results with olfactometer citronella oil exhibited an 80% attraction response rate for both sexes, while menthol exhibited a 60% attraction response rate for females and 100% for males. By contrast, menthol had a more significant effect on adults than citronella, lethal concentration at 50 scale (LC50) values of 1.03, 0.89, and 0.9 mg, and LC95 values of 5.09, 2.01, and 1.59 mg, after 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. For citronella oil, the LC50 values were 2.09, 1.76, and 1.70 mg after 24, 48, and 72 h, and the LC95 values were 5.5, 3.7, and 1.5 mg after 24, 48 and 72h, were noted. In the present study, the effects of citronella and methanol insecticides were observed on six types of hemocytes namely prohemocytes, granulocytes, plasmatocytes, oenocytes, coagulocytes and spherulocytes. Both citronella oil and menthol had a histopathological effect on the hemocytes of the adult red palm weevil, specifically, on the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. The findings also revealed that the vacuoles in some hemocytes, specifically, the prohemocytes, plasmatocytes, and granulocytes were more sensitive than those in other hemocytes, which remained unaffected by the treatment.The effects of citronella and menthol on RPW immunity were demonstrated in this study, and this information may be applied to their usage in integrated pest control at sub-lethal dosages.",

      "abstract": "Mastitis is one of the most serious diseases that causes losses in the dairy industry, seriously impairing milk production and milk quality, and even affecting human health. Menthol is a cyclic monoterpene compound obtained from the stem and leaves of peppermint, which has a variety of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the preventive effect of menthol on the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in primary bovine mammary gland epithelial cells (BMECs) and its anti-inflammatory mechanism. First, BMECs were isolated and amplified from the udders of Holstein cows by enzymatic hydrolysis. BMECs were treated with menthol (10, 50, 100, 200 μM) for 1h, followed by lipopolysaccharide (5μg/ml) for 12 h. Lipopolysaccharide treatment upregulated the protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS) and the mRNA abundance of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), while menthol was able to inhibit this effect. The inhibitory effect of menthol on proinflammatory factors was significantly reduced when autophagy was blocked using 3-Methyladenine (5μg/ml), an inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide treatment reduced the expression levels of milk lipids and milk proteins, which were inhibited by menthol. In addition, menthol (200 μM) treatment was able to significantly upregulate the expression level of autophagy-related protein LC3B, downregulate the expression level of P62, promote the expression abundance of autophagy-related gene mRNA, and enhance significantly enhance autophagic flux. Interestingly, treatment of BMECs with menthol (200 μM) promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51 like kinase 1 (ULK1) and increased the nuclear localization of nuclear factor-E2 associated factor 2 (Nrf-2). When the AMPK pathway was blocked using compound C (10μg/ml), an inhibitor of AMPK, autophagy was significantly inhibited. Autophagy levels were significantly decreased after blocking the Nrf-2 pathway using ML385 (5μg/ml), an inhibitor of Nrf-2. Overall, the data suggest that menthol activates the AMPK-ULK1 pathway to initiate the onset of autophagy and maintains the level of autophagy through the AMPK-Nrf-2 pathway. In conclusion, the findings suggest that menthol may alleviate the inflammatory response in BMECs via the AMPK/ULK1/Nrf-2/autophagy pathway.",

The optimum extraction efficiency was achieved using 300 µL of tetrahydrofuran, 30 mg of menthol and vortexing for 1 min before centrifuging the sample for 5 min at 3467g. Addition of menthol does not only induce phase separation, but also helps to form reverse micelles to facilitate extraction. The highly polar favipiravir molecules would be incorporated into the hydrophilic core of the formed reverse micelle to be extracted by the non-polar organic extractant. The method was validated according to the FDA bioanalytical method guidelines. The developed method was found linear in the concentration range of 0.1 to 100 µg/mL with a coefficient of determination of 0.9992. The method accuracy and precision were studied by calculating the recovery (%) and the relative standard deviation (%), respectively. The recovery (%) was in the range of 97.1-103.9%, while the RSD (%) values ranged between 2.03 and 8.15 %. The developed method was successfully applied in a bioequivalence study of Flupirava® 200 mg versus Avigan® 200 mg, after a single oral dose of favipiravir administered to healthy adult volunteers. The proposed method was simple, cheap, more eco-friendly and sufficiently sensitive for biomedical application.",

This study aimed to investigate the skin wound healing potential of menthol, as well as the mechanisms involved in its effect, after 3, 7, or 14 days of treatment, according to the phases of wound healing. Skin wound was performed in the back of Wistar rats, which were topically treated with vehicle cream; collagenase-based cream (1.2 U/g); or menthol-based cream at 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1.0% over 3, 7, or 14 days. Menthol cream at 0.5% accelerated the healing right from the inflammatory phase (3 days) by decreasing mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and Il-6. At the proliferative phase (7 days), menthol 0.5% increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD, GR, and GPx, as well as the level of GSH, in addition to decreasing the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β and augmenting mRNA expression for Ki-67, a marker of cellular proliferation. At the remodeling phase (14 days), levels of inflammatory cytokines were decreased, and the level of Il-10 and its mRNA expression were increased in the menthol 0.5% group. Menthol presented skin wound healing activity by modulating the antioxidant system of the cells and the inflammatory response, in addition to stimulating epithelialization."

We examined the actions underlying the effects of an insulin sensitizer, tolimidone (MLR-1023) and investigated its effects on body weight. Diet-induced obesity (CD1/ICR) and type 2 diabetes (db/db) mouse models were used to study the effect of MLR-1023 on metabolic outcomes and to explore its synergy with menthol. We also examined the efficacy of MLR-1023 alone in a clinical trial (NCT02317796), as well as in combination with menthol in human adipocytes. MLR-1023 produced weight loss in humans in four weeks, and in mice fed a high-fat diet it reduced weight gain and fat mass without affecting food intake. In human adipocytes from obese donors, the upregulation of Uncoupling Protein 1, Glucose (UCP)1, adiponectin, Glucose Transporter Type 4 (GLUT4), Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL), Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 beta (CPT1β), and Transient Receptor Potential Melastin (TRPM8) mRNA expression suggested the induction of thermogenesis. The TRPM8 agonist, menthol, potentiated the effect of MLR-1023 on the upregulation of genes for energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity in human adipocytes, and reduced fasting blood glucose in mice. The amplification of the thermogenic program by MLR-1023 and menthol in the absence of adrenergic activation will likely be well-tolerated, and bears investigation in a clinical trial."

In addition, novel palliative interventions are required for multiple perspectives of breathlessness that may still be present after disease-specific therapies. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms and effects of l-menthol on breathlessness by covering the latest relevant papers. RECENT FINDINGS: A literature review identified one randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of l-menthol on relieving breathlessness in patients with COPD. It has been reported that the mechanism of relieving breathlessness partly involves stimulation of the trigeminal nerve by the cooling sensation of l-menthol, which gives a cognitive illusion of inspiratory flow perception. The effect of l-menthol on breathlessness caused by exertion has been reported in healthy subjects but not yet in patients with breathlessness. SUMMARY: The effect of l-menthol on the sensory-emotional dimensions of laboratory-induced breathlessness in patients with COPD has been described in a clinical trial. Further studies are warranted to investigate its application to inspiratory muscle training and its effects in combination with exercise training.",

The current study aim was to use prospective survey data to identify if menthol cigarette use was associated with changes in smoking among adults. A representative cohort from the 2010 U.S. Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey was interviewed at two time points one year apart. Respondents were past-30-day cigarette smokers at Wave 1 or Wave 2 categorized by menthol vs. non-menthol flavor preference (n = 3668). Trajectories were categorized as maintained, increased, or decreased smoking behavior between Waves. Multinomial logistic regressions examined if menthol cigarette use was associated with an increase/decrease in smoking behavior, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Menthol cigarette use was not associated with change over time in cigarette smoking in adult smokers. Age, race/ethnicity and sex were associated with changes in cigarette smoking. Young (vs. older) adults were more likely to increase smoking. Black and Hispanic smokers (vs. white smokers) were more likely to report any change in smoking. Males were less likely than females to change smoking behavior. Menthol status was not associated with changes in smoking among adults; however, young age, race/ethnicity, and sex were, suggesting populations to target for intervention.",

This study examined associations between menthol smoking and socioeconomic deprivation with nicotine dependence and quitting behaviors among Black/African American women cigarette and/or little cigar/cigarillo smokers, aged 18-50 living in low-resource, rural communities. Baseline survey data from a randomized controlled behavioral/intervention trial (#NCT03476837) were analyzed (n = 146). Outcomes included time to first tobacco product (cigarette/little cigar/cigarillo) use within 5 min of waking, Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score, and ever attempting to quit cigarettes. Socioeconomic deprivation measures included education, income, and receiving supplemental nutritional assistance (SNAP) program benefits. In adjusted regression analyses, menthol smoking was associated with both greater FTND scores and time to first tobacco product use within 5 min of waking, but not ever attempting to quit cigarettes. Regardless of menthol status, only 25.0% of smokers reported that they would quit smoking if menthol cigarettes were banned. The proportion of smokers who smoked their first tobacco product within 5 min of waking increased slightly with greater socioeconomic deprivation. Additional research and targeted efforts are needed to reduce nicotine dependence among Black/African American women smokers living in rural, low-resource communities where access to cessation services is limited.",

However, there are no reports of differences in the pain pressure threshold (PPT) or the relative effectiveness of topical analgesics to reduce pain in the upper and lower body muscles and tendons. The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in PPT and relative pain attenuation associated with a menthol-based topical analgesic over a variety of upper and lower body muscles and tendons. DESIGN: Randomized allocation, controlled, intervention study. METHODS: Sixteen participants (10 females and 6 males) were tested on their dominant or nondominant side. The order of specific muscle/tendon testing was also randomized, which included upper body (middle deltoid, biceps brachii, and lateral epicondylar tendon) and lower body locations (quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, lumbosacral erector spinae muscles, and patellar and Achilles tendons). The PPT was monitored before and 15 minutes following the application of a menthol-based topical analgesic. RESULTS: A menthol-based topical analgesic increased PPT (decreased pain sensitivity) overall (P = .05; 11.6% [2.4%]; d = 1.05) and PPT was higher (P < .0001; 31.5%-44.2%; d = 1.03-1.8) for lower versus upper body locations. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals and the public can be assured of similar reductions in pain sensitivity independent of the location of application of a menthol-based topical analgesic.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In warm conditions topical application of menthol increases cool sensations and influences deep body temperature. The purpose of this experiment was to explore whether different body surface areas (BSA) exposed to menthol influence these responses. It was hypothesized that the forcing function exerted by menthol will be proportionally related to BSA. METHOD: Using a within-participant design, 13 participants underwent three BSA exposures (Small [S; finger]; Medium [M; arm]; Large [L; upper/lower body]) to 4.13% menthol, and one Placebo exposure. During each exposure participants rested supine in a tent (30 °C, 50%rh) for 30-min before their intervention and 30-min thereafter. Measures included thermal sensation, thermal comfort, irritation, skin blood flow (finger SkBF; laser Doppler flowmetry), rectal temperature (Tre), and skin temperature (chest, forearm, thigh, calf). The Area Under the Curve from minute 30 to 60 was calculated and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA or Friedman's test with post-hoc testing (0.05 alpha level). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in any measure of thermometry (p > 0.05), while SKBF was significantly lowered in L, M, and S vs. P respectively (p < 0.05). Participants in L felt cooler vs. P and S (p < 0.05). Losses in thermal comfort were noted in L and M vs. P and S (p < 0.05), along with increased irritation in L vs. S (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar skin temperatures, larger BSA's exposed to menthol caused cooler sensations, likely due to the activation of a larger pool of menthol-sensitive neurons. This occurred in the absence of thermal discomfort and without perceptions of irritation exceeding 'weak'. Larger BSA's also exhibited greater alterations in Tre, likely driven by a reduction in SkBF, but despite this mean body temperature was regulated suggesting the thermoregulatory system can cope with the range of BSA exposures studied herein.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Menthol cigarettes were banned in Ontario, Canada on January 1st, 2017. We used concept mapping, a mixed-method approach, to describe how menthol cigarette smokers quit smoking after the Ontario menthol ban. METHODS: Pre-ban daily and non-daily menthol cigarette smokers who reported smoking abstinence 24 months after the ban (n = 62; 53.2% women; mean age = 43.6, SD = 12.5) generated statements describing reasons and strategies for smoking cessation/reduction after the menthol ban. Participants sorted a final list of 57 statements into groups of similar content and rated statements on how true each statement was for them and multidimensional scaling analysis identified thematic clusters. RESULTS: Six clusters were identified: Mental and Environment Changes, Direct Ban Impacts, Health Reasons, Cues to Action, Family and Friends, and Cessation Strategies. The highest rated statements (i.e., most true) suggested many participants were motivated to quit smoking before or after the ban and 30.7% of participants believed the menthol ban helped with smoking cessation. Some of the lowest rated statements included using nicotine replacement therapy products, medication (i.e., Champix), or other tobacco products suggesting these strategies were less common. Statement ratings suggested many smokers quit without using replacement products or medication, but modifying cognitions and avoiding smoking cues were common. CONCLUSIONS: The menthol ban aided some menthol smokers to quit, while others reported the ban did not play a role in smoking cessation. These data suggest the menthol ban had direct and indirect effects on smoking reduction behavior. Campaigns supporting similar bans that target both types of effects will likely be most effective for smoking reduction.",

Antidopaminergic drugs being effective in reducing MS create a path for effective therapy against MS by regulating dopamine levels. We aimed to evaluate the role of the striatum and brainstem dopamine and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in MS and the efficacy of menthol (MNT) to modulate dopamine and DRD2 in vitro and in vivo for possible amelioration of MS. Evaluation of efficacy of MNT to inhibit dopamine release from PC12 cells and anti-MS efficacy in BALB/c mice model was performed. Dopamine, DRD2 expression in PC12 cells, mice striatum, and brainstem were detected using HPLC-ECD, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis, respectively. DRD2 expression increased in calcium ionophore-treated PC12 cells compared with control cells. Pretreatment with 50 μg/ml menthol decreased dopamine and DRD2 expression. Similarly, dopamine and DRD2 levels in mice striatum and brainstem of MS group (rotation induced) increased significantly compared with control group NC (no rotation). Pretreatment with menthol at 50 mg/kg concentration (rotation induced) showed decreased dopamine and DRD2 expression, thus indicating ameliorative effect on MS. Hence, we suggest that increased striatum and brainstem dopamine and DRD2 levels might lead to MS symptoms, and menthol could be used as a potent herbal alternative medicine for MS. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Antidopaminergic drugs being effective in reducing motion sickness (MS) creates a path for effective therapy against MS by regulating dopamine levels. Increased striatum and brainstem dopamine and Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) levels might lead to the MS symptoms induced by rotation stimulation in mice model. Menthol showed a prophylactic effect on rotation-induced MS by reducing striatal and brainstem dopamine levels, DRD2 mRNA, and protein expression. Menthol could be used as an herbal alternative to antidopaminergics to minimize the associated adverse effects."

METHODS: We compared the probability of 30+ day and 12-month abstinence from cigarette smoking by menthol use status using two cohorts of US adult cigarette smokers who attempted to quit smoking in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (wave 1 to wave 3 and wave 2 to wave 4; n=5759), inverse probability of treatment weighting and adjusted risk ratios (aRRs). RESULTS: Using menthol (vs non-menthol) prior to a quit attempt decreased the probability of 30+ day abstinence by 28% (aRR=0.78; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91) and the probability of 12-month abstinence by 53% (aRR=0.65; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88). Additionally, switching from menthol (vs maintaining menthol use) increased the probability of 30+ day abstinence by 58% (aRR=1.58; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.50) and the probability of 12-month abstinence by 97% (aRR=1.86; 95% CI 0.92 to 3.74). Switching to menthol (vs maintaining non-menthol use) was associated with a lower probability of 30+ day (aRR=0.70; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.16) and 12-month abstinence (aRR=0.64; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.36), but these associations were imprecise. The effects of menthol use on impaired quitting were slightly larger for non-Hispanic Black smokers, but not different for other demographic groups. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that menthol impaired menthol smokers' attempts to quit smoking but switching from menthol improved success. This suggests that removing menthol may improve menthol smokers' success during quit attempts.",

      "abstract": "We previously designed a Carbopol gel formulation (N-IND/MEN) based on a combination of indomethacin solid nanoparticles (IND-NPs) and l-menthol, and we reported that the N-IND/MEN showed high transdermal penetration. However, the detailed mechanism for transdermal penetration of IND-NPs was not clearly defined. In this study, we investigated whether endocytosis in the skin tissue of rat and Göttingen minipig is related to the transdermal penetration of IND-NPs using pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis. The pharmacological inhibitors used in this study are as follows: 54 µM nystatin, a caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CavME) inhibitor; 40 µM dynasore, a clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitor; and 2 µM rottlerin, a micropinocytosis (MP) inhibitor. The N-IND/MEN was prepared by a bead mill method, and the particle size of solid indomethacin was 79-216 nm. In both rat and Göttingen minipig skin, skin penetration of approximately 80% IND-NPs was limited by the stratum corneum (SC), although the penetration of SC was improved by the combination of l-menthol. On the other hand, the treatment of nystatin and dynasore decreased the transdermal penetration of indomethacin in rats and Göttingen minipigs treated with N-IND/MEN. Moreover, in addition to nystatin and dynasore, rottlerin attenuated the transdermal penetration of IND-NPs in the Göttingen minipigs' skin. In conclusion, we found that l-menthol enhanced the SC penetration of IND-NPs. In addition, this study suggests that the SC-passed IND-NPs are absorbed into the skin tissue by energy-dependent endocytosis (CavME, CME, and/or MP pathways) on the epidermis under the SC, resulting in an enhancement in transdermal penetration of IND-NPs. These findings provide significant information for the design of nanomedicines in transdermal formulations.",

While menthol cigarette use has been associated with low cessation rates, research has not explored the impact of menthol cigarette use on tobacco use outcomes among smokers with OUD. Participants were current smokers, in methadone treatment for OUD, participating in randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation therapies. We examined the use of menthol cigarettes, and the association between menthol cigarette use and achieving 24-hour quit attempts and seven-day point prevalence abstinence. Of 268 participants, 237 (88.4%) reported menthol use. A similar proportion of menthol and non-menthol smokers achieved a 24-hour quit attempt (83.1% vs. 83.8%, p = 0.92). Though fewer menthol smokers (vs. non-menthol smokers) achieved abstinence (12.7% vs. 22.6%), this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.14). In this sample of smokers with OUD, menthol smoking was nearly ubiquitous. Menthol smoking was not associated with differences in quit attempts, but was associated with differences in cessation that were not statistically significant. Menthol smoking may contribute to the challenges in achieving abstinence among smokers with OUD.",

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single dose l-menthol solution in suppressing gastric peristalsis during upper GI endoscopy in Chinese patients. METHODS: In this phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03263910), 220 patients scheduled to undergo upper GI endoscopy at five Chinese referral centers received a single dose of either 160 mg of l-menthol (n = 109) or placebo (n = 111). Both treatments were sprayed endoscopically on the gastric mucosa. An independent committee evaluated the degree of gastric peristalsis (peristaltic score: grade 1-5). RESULTS: At baseline, the proportion of patients with grade 1 peristalsis (no peristalsis) did not differ between the groups. The proportion of patients with grade 1 peristalsis post-treatment was significantly higher in the l-menthol group (40.37%, 44/109) versus the placebo group (16.22%, 18/111; P < 0.001); the difference between the groups was 24.15% (95% confidence interval: 12.67%-35.63%; P < 0.001). In the l-menthol group, 61.47% of patients had grade 1 peristalsis after endoscopy versus 24.55% in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The ease of intragastric examination correlated significantly with the grade of peristalsis. The incidence of adverse events was comparable between the groups (P = 0.340). CONCLUSIONS: During upper GI endoscopy, a single dose of l-menthol solution (160 mg) sprayed on the gastric mucosa significantly attenuated gastric peristalsis versus placebo, thereby improving the visual stability without any safety concerns.",

Organic disorders were ruled out with paraclinical tests and in-hospital treatment was administered.

The expression of P-gp in HepG2 cells was significantly increased by menthol treatment. Intracellular accumulation of DOX in HepG2 cells was significantly lower in the menthol-treated group than in the control group, but this phenomenon was abolished in the presence of verapamil. Decreased cell viability by DOX was significantly attenuated by 24-h menthol treatment prior to DOX exposure, which coincided with the changes in mRNA expression of Bcl-xl and caspase-3. These results demonstrate that menthol causes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to acquire resistance to DOX by increasing its efflux through the upregulation of P-gp.",

      "abstract": "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Depression has become a global threat to human health. In order to solve it, researchers have conducted multi-faceted studies including diet. Many food-derived bioactive substances have shown antidepressant effects. However, there are few studies on the design of industrialized food with antidepressant effect. This study aims to evaluate the antidepressant effect of a functional beverage made from several ingredients with potential antidepressant function and investigate its antidepressant mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The beverage consists of peppermint oil, active peptides derived from bovine milk casein and Acanthopanax senticosus extract (ASE) whose active ingredient is eleutheroside. Different amounts of ASE were evaluated to determine the optimal concentration of eleutheroside in this functional beverage to deliver the best antidepressant effect through extensive behavioral testing, including preliminary acute stress experiments and further chronic unpredictable mild stress test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the beverage with 15 mg/kg of eleutheroside could significantly reduce the mice's immobility time of tail suspension test and forced swimming test, recover mice's sucrose preference and behavior changes in the open field test, improve the contents of dopamine, norepinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and the activity of superoxide dismutase and reduce the content of malondialdehyde in mice's brains, which indicated that the improvement of monoamine neurotransmitter systems and antioxidation was one potential mechanism of antidepressant action. NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: This study provides a design of antidepressant functional beverage and an efficient way for the prevention and treatment of depression."

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are the most widely used electronic nicotine delivery systems and are designed to imitate smoking and aid in smoking cessation. Although the number of e-cigarette users is increasing rapidly, especially among young adults and adolescents, the potential health impacts and biologic effects of e-cigarettes still need to be elucidated. Our previous study demonstrated the cytotoxic effects of electronic liquids (e-liquids) in a human middle ear epithelial cell (HMEEC-1) line, which were affected by the manufacturer and flavoring agents regardless of the presence of nicotine. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the gene expression profile and identify potential molecular modulator genes and pathways in HMEEC-1 exposed to two different e-liquids (tobacco- and menthol-flavored). HMEEC-1 was exposed to e-liquids, and RNA sequencing, functional analysis, and pathway analysis were conducted to identify the resultant transcriptomic changes. A total of 843 genes were differentially expressed following exposure to the tobacco-flavored e-liquid, among which 262 genes were upregulated and 581 were downregulated. Upon exposure to the menthol-flavored e-liquid, a total of 589 genes were differentially expressed, among which 228 genes were upregulated and 361 were downregulated. Among the signaling pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes mediated by tobacco-flavored e-liquid exposure, several key molecular genes were identified, including IL6 (interleukin 6), PTGS2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2), CXCL8 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8), JUN (Jun proto-oncogene), FOS (Fos proto-oncogene), and TP53 (tumor protein 53). Under menthol-flavored e-liquid treatment, MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), PTGS2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2), MYC (MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor), HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1), NOS3 (nitric oxide synthase 3), and CAV1 (caveolin 1) were predicted as key genes. In addition, we identified related cellular processes, including inflammatory responses, oxidative stress and carcinogenesis, under exposure to tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-liquids. We identified differentially expressed genes and related cellular processes and gene signaling pathways after e-cigarette exposure in human middle ear cells. These findings may provide useful evidence for understanding the effect of e-cigarette exposure.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Peppermint is traditionally used as an antigalactagogue in breastfeeding women. However, the suppressive mechanism remains unclear. The authors investigate whether and how peppermint influences milk production at the cellular and molecular levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: A lactating mammary epithelial cell (MEC) culture model that produces major milk components is prepared. Peppermint oil (PMO) suppresses β-casein production in conjunction with the induced enlargement of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs). PMO also significantly inactivates STAT5 and mTOR in the lactogenic signaling pathway. Menthol treatment, which is a primary PMO component, leads to decreases in β-casein production, enlarged CLDs, the inactivated STAT5 and mTOR. Eucalyptol and menthyl acetate, other components of peppermint, does not show suppressive effects on lactating MECs. The inactivation of STAT5 and mTOR upon menthol administration is also evident in alveolar MECs of lactating mice. Furthermore, lactating MECs expresses TRPM8 and TRPA1, which are menthol receptors known as cold receptors. Agonists of TRPM8 and TRPA1 suppresses β-casein production and inactivation of STAT5 and mTOR in the lactating MECs. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that peppermint has potential as an antigalactagogue. Menthol is suggested to be an active compound in peppermint. TRPM8 and TRPA1 may function as receptors for menthol."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study examined the impact of a San Francisco City and County ban on all flavoured tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, among clients in residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional surveys of clients at two residential SUD programmes before the County began enforcing the ban (n=160) and twice after enforcement began (n=102, n=120). The samples were compared on demographic characteristics, smoking status, smoking behaviours and the proportion reporting menthol as their usual cigarette. Menthol smokers were asked whether they smoked only menthol cigarettes, mostly menthol, both menthol and non-menthol or mostly non-menthol. Post-ban samples were asked about awareness of the ban and access to menthol cigarettes. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, we found no evidence that the ban was associated with decreased number of cigarettes per day or increased readiness to quit among current smokers. However, odds were lower post-ban for reporting menthol as the usual cigarette (OR=0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.90), and for smoking only menthol cigarettes (OR=0.19, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.19). Perhaps most importantly, and with the ability to influence all other findings, 50% of self-identified menthol smokers reported purchasing menthol cigarettes in San Francisco nearly 1 year after the ban was implemented. CONCLUSION: In subgroups where smoking has remained elevated, like those receiving SUD treatment, local menthol bans may have only modest impacts on smoking behaviour. Broader regional, state or national bans, that effectively restrict access to menthol products, may be needed to show stronger effects on smoking behaviour.",

METHODS: 16HBE cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL IL-13, 1 mmol/L menthol, or both (1 mmol/L menthol was added after 6 days of IL-13 stimulation), and the changes in the expression of MUC5AC, intracellular Ca2+ concentration and Bcl-2 expression were evaluated. The effects of ABT-263 (a Bcl-2 inhibitor) and BCTC (a TRPM8 ion channel inhibitor), alone or in combination, on MUC5AC expression in the cells were tested, and the changes in intracellular Ca2+ and Bcl-2 expression following BCTC treatment were observed. The cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 assay, the mRNA expressions of MUC5AC and Bcl-2 were detected with real-time quantitative PCR, the level of MUC5AC in the culture medium was measured with ELISA, and the intracellular Ca2+ fluorescence intensity was determined with flow cytometry. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein expressions of MUC5AC increased significantly in 16HBE cells following stimulation with IL-13, menthol, and both (P < 0.05), and were the highest in the combined treatment group with its peak level occurred at 24 h (P < 0.01). The intracellular Ca2+ fluorescence intensity and Bcl-2 mRNA expression were also increased in 16HBE cells after the stimulations (P < 0.05), and the increments were the most obvious in the combined treatment group (P < 0.01). Treatment with BCTC significantly lowered intracellular Ca2+ fluorescence intensity and the expressions of Bcl-2 and MUC5AC mRNA and protein in the cells stimulated with menthol or with both IL-13 and menthol (P < 0.05), but caused no significant changes in IL-13-stimulated cells (P > 0.05). Treatment with ABT-263 significantly lowered the mRNA and protein expressions of MUC5AC in the cells stimulated with IL-13 and menthol either alone or in combination (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Menthol combined with IL-13 produces a synergistic effect to promote the synthesis and secretion of MUC5AC in 16HBE cells possibly by activating TRPM8 receptor to upregulate the expression of Bcl-2.",

      "abstract": "Increasing basal energy expenditure via uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent non-shivering thermogenesis is an attractive therapeutic strategy for treatment of obesity. Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel activation by cold and cold mimetics induces UCP1 transcription and prevents obesity in animals, but the clinical relevance of this relationship remains incompletely understood. A review of TRPM8 channel agonism for treatment of obesity focusing on menthol was undertaken. Adipocyte TRPM8 activation results in Ca2+ influx and protein kinase A (PKA) activation, which induces mitochondrial elongation, mitochondrial localization to lipid droplets, lipolysis, β-oxidation, and UCP1 expression. Ca2+-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species activate UCP1. In animals, TRPM8 agonism increases basal metabolic rate, non-shivering thermogenesis, oxygen consumption, exercise endurance, and fatty acid oxidation and decreases abdominal fat percentage. Menthol prevents high-fat diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and liver triacylglycerol accumulation. Hypothalamic TRPM8 activation releases glucagon, which activates PKA and promotes catabolism. TRPM8 polymorphisms are associated with obesity. In humans, oral menthol and other TRPM8 agonists have little effect. However, topical menthol appears to increase core body temperature and metabolic rate. A randomized clinical control trial of topical menthol in obese patients is warranted."

      "abstract": "Environmental change, including global warming and chemical pollution, can compromise cnidarian-(e.g., coral-) dinoflagellate symbioses and cause coral bleaching. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate these symbioses will inform strategies for sustaining healthy coral-reef communities. A model system for corals is the symbiosis between the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida (common name Aiptasia) and its dinoflagellate partners (family Symbiodiniaceae). To complement existing studies of the interactions between these organisms, we examined the impact of menthol, a reagent often used to render cnidarians aposymbiotic, on the dinoflagellate Breviolum minutum, both in culture and in hospite. In both environments, the growth and photosynthesis of this alga were compromised at either 100 or 300 µM menthol. We observed reduction in PSII and PSI functions, the abundances of reaction-center proteins, and, at 300 µM menthol, of total cellular proteins. Interestingly, for free-living algae exposed to 100 µM menthol, an initial decline in growth, photosynthetic activities, pigmentation, and protein abundances reversed after 5-15 d, eventually approaching control levels. This behavior was observed in cells maintained in continuous light, but not in cells experiencing a light-dark regimen, suggesting that B. minutum can detoxify menthol or acclimate and repair damaged photosynthetic complexes in a light- and/or energy-dependent manner. Extended exposures of cultured algae to 300 µM menthol ultimately resulted in algal death. Most symbiotic anemones were also unable to survive this menthol concentration for 30 d. Additionally, cells impaired for photosynthesis by pre-treatment with 300 µM menthol exhibited reduced efficiency in re-populating the anemone host.",

      "abstract": "Menthol is often used as a cold-mimicking substance to allegedly enhance performance during physical activity, however menthol-induced activation of cold-defence responses during exercise can intensify heat accumulation in the body. This meta-analysis aimed at studying the effects of menthol on thermal perception and thermophysiological homeostasis during exercise. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were searched until May 2020. Menthol caused cooler thermal sensation by weighted mean difference (WMD) of - 1.65 (95% CI, - 2.96 to - 0.33) and tended to improve thermal comfort (WMD = 1.42; 95% CI, - 0.13 to 2.96) during physical exercise. However, there was no meaningful difference in sweat production (WMD = - 24.10 ml; 95% CI, - 139.59 to 91.39 ml), deep body temperature (WMD = 0.02 °C; 95% CI, - 0.11 to 0.15 °C), and heart rate (WMD = 2.67 bpm; 95% CI - 0.74 to 6.09 bpm) between the treatment groups. Menthol improved the performance time in certain subgroups, which are discussed. Our findings suggest that different factors, viz., external application, warmer environment, and higher body mass index can improve menthol's effects on endurance performance, however menthol does not compromise warmth-defence responses during exercise, thus it can be safely applied by athletes from the thermoregulation point of view.",

Fasudil and menthol may be potent neuroprotective agents, which act by inhibiting a rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and suppressing the inflammatory response, respectively. We hypothesized that combined treatment of fasudil and menthol could improve functional recovery by decreasing inflammation, apoptosis, and glial scar formation. We tested our hypothesis by administering fasudil and menthol intraperitoneally (i.p.) to female Sprague Dawley rats after moderate static compression (35 g of impounder for 5 min) of T10 spinal cord. The rats were randomly divided into five experimental groups: (i) sham animals received laminectomy alone, (ii) injured (SCI) and untreated (saline 0.2 mL/day, i.p.) rats, (iii) injured (SCI) rats treated with fasudil (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for two weeks, (iv) injured (SCI) rats treated with menthol (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for twoweeks, (v) injured (SCI) rats treated with fasudil (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and menthol (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for two weeks. Compared to single treatment groups, combined treatment of fasudil and menthol demonstrated significant functional recovery and pain amelioration, which, thereby, significantly reduced inflammation, apoptosis, and glial/fibrotic scar formation. Therefore, combined treatment of fasudil and menthol may provide effective amelioration of spinal cord dysfunction by a synergistic effect of fasudil and menthol."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2017 and 2018, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth and Falcon Heights, Minnesota were among the first US cities to restrict the sale of menthol tobacco to adult-only stores. The study examined changes in the availability and marketing of these products following policy implementation. METHODS: Retail store audits were conducted approximately 2 months pre-policy and post-policy implementation. Tobacco retail stores (n=299) were sampled from tobacco licensing lists in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth and Falcon Heights, as well as six comparison cities without menthol policies. The presence of menthol tobacco was assessed, along with the number of interior and exterior tobacco ads and promotions at each store. RESULTS: The majority of policy intervention stores (grocery, convenience stores and pharmacies) were compliant (Minneapolis, 84.4%; Duluth, 97.5%; and St. Paul and Falcon Heights, 100.0%) and did not sell menthol tobacco. In contrast, menthol tobacco was available in all comparison city stores, and most (96.0%) exempted tobacco shops and liquor stores post-policy implementation. Two Minneapolis convenience stores added interior tobacco shops, allowing them to continue selling menthol tobacco. Significant decreases in menthol tobacco marketing post-policy were observed in the stores' interior in Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth (p<0.001) and on the stores' exterior in Duluth (p=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate high rates of compliance, indicating that sales restrictions can significantly reduce the availability of menthol tobacco. However, challenges to policy adherence underscore the need for continued monitoring and enforcement action.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is a very rare disease with fewer than 200 cases reported. It has been hypothesized to be a hypersensitivity reaction to an unidentified antigen. The clinical presentation typically involves fever, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and bibasilar inspiratory crackles within the first week of antigen exposure. Chest imaging usually reveals bilateral reticular and/or ground-glass opacities. Bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrates >25% eosinophils. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment with good results; however, optimum dose and length of treatment are unclear. We present a case of a 31-year-old male who presented with 2 days of shortness of breath, cough, pleuritic chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea, and poor appetite in the setting of initiation of menthol-flavored cigarettes 2 weeks before presentation. He rapidly progressed to respiratory failure requiring intubation despite broad antibiotic coverage. His course was complicated by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, circulatory shock, and renal failure. He underwent bronchoalveolar lavage testing that revealed 60% eosinophils. He was treated with steroids and was subsequently extubated and discharged. Eosinophilic counts in the blood peaked on the 10th day of admission to 34%. One week later, the patient was completely free of symptoms. The initiation of menthol cigarette use in this patient is the likely reason for ensuing acute eosinophilic pneumonia, hence adding to the sporadic reports on the role of menthol-flavored cigarettes. This case emphasizes a greater reliance on risk factors, as opposed to eosinophilic markers, for the diagnosis and treatment of acute eosinophilic pneumonia to prevent subsequent respiratory failure and intubation in such patients.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Despite the strong relationship between marijuana and tobacco use, especially among African American individuals and males, very few studies have examined the association between marijuana and menthol cigarette use. This study was designed to identify the prevalence of past month, past year and lifetime marijuana use and marijuana dependence among menthol and non-menthol cigarette smokers, as well as the association between marijuana and menthol cigarette use among African American female and male cigarette smokers. Methods: Data were drawn from 1,173 African American adult cigarette smokers in the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Results: Overall, 8.8%, 13.9% and 44.7% of African American menthol and non-menthol cigarette smokers reported past month, past year and lifetime marijuana use, respectively. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models revealed a significant interaction between gender and past month marijuana use on menthol cigarette use (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.21-2.42, p < .05). Past month marijuana use was associated with an increased odds of past month menthol cigarette use (relative to non-menthol cigarette use) among females, but a decreased odds of past of past month menthol cigarette use among males. Conclusions: When stratified by gender, marijuana use is differentially related to menthol cigarette use among African American adults. Given the prevalence of menthol cigarette use among this population, it is important to examine factors such as marijuana use that could be targeted in prevention and treatment interventions for African Americans, especially females, who are at risk for smoking or are currently smoking menthol cigarettes. Implications: This study found that marijuana use was associated with an increased odds of menthol cigarette use among African American females, while marijuana use was associated with a decreased odds of menthol cigarette use among their male counterparts. The impact of marijuana use on menthol cigarette smoking differs among females and males, highlighting the need for gender-tailored interventions that target marijuana use among African American individuals, especially females, who are at risk for smoking or are currently smoking menthol cigarettes.",

      "abstract": "Alveolar echinococcosis is one of the most dangerous parasitic zoonoses. This disease, widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, is caused by the metacestode stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. All surgical and non-surgical patients should perform chemotherapy with benzimidazoles, mainly with albendazole. However, the efficacy of albendazole is variable due to its deficient pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, the need to find new therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis is evident. Menthol is a natural compound of low toxicity, used in industries such as cosmetics and gastronomy and generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration. In addition, menthol has important pharmacological effects and is effective against a wide variety of organisms. The development of prodrugs allows improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the parental drug. To improve lipophilicity and therefore the bioavailability of menthol, a novel prodrug called menthol-pentanol was developed by masking the functional polar group of menthol by linking n-pentanol by a carbonate bond. The aim of the current work was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of menthol and menthol-pentanol against E. multilocularis. Menthol-pentanol had a greater protoscolicidal effect than menthol. In addition, the prodrug demonstrated a similar clinical efficacy to albendazole. The increase in lipophilicity of the prodrug with respect to menthol was reflected in an increase in its antiparasitic activity against E. multilocularis. Thus, menthol-pentanol appears as a promising candidate for further evaluation as a potential alternative for the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis.",

Previous studies have shown that the expression of TRPV1 increases in the sensory neurons of the esophagus during the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophagitis, but the response of TRPV1 in esophageal epithelial cells (EECs), which directly confront the refluxed acid, is still unknown. Here, we found that acid reflux triggered esophageal damage, which was accompanied by increased expression of TRPV1 in EECs and TRPV1 channel activity in these cells. Furthermore, menthol inhibited the Ca2+ influx induced by acid stimulation in EECs. After menthol treatment, the expression of TRPV1 in EECs was significantly reduced, and their hyperplasia was significantly reduced; finally, the inflammation pathway elicited in EECs was diminished in mice with acid reflux. These results suggest that menthol improves the clinical symptoms caused by gastroesophageal acid reflux by interfering with TRPV1 in EECs."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Because 30% of cigarettes sold in the United States are characterized as menthol cigarettes, it is important to understand how menthol preference may affect the impact of a nicotine reduction policy. METHODS: In a recent trial, non-treatment-seeking smokers were randomly assigned to receive very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNC; 0.4 mg nicotine/g tobacco) or normal nicotine cigarettes (NNC; 15.5 mg/g) for 20 weeks. On the basis of preference, participants received menthol or non-menthol cigarettes. We conducted multivariable regression analyses to examine whether menthol preference moderated the effects of nicotine content on cigarettes per day (CPD), breath carbon monoxide (CO), urinary total nicotine equivalents (TNE), urinary 2-cyanoethylmercapturic acid (CEMA), and abstinence. RESULTS: At baseline, menthol smokers (n = 346) reported smoking fewer CPD (14.9 vs. 19.2) and had lower TNE (52.8 vs. 71.6 nmol/mg) and CO (17.7 vs. 20.5 ppm) levels than non-menthol smokers (n = 406; ps < .05). At week 20, significant interactions indicated that menthol smokers had smaller treatment effects than non-menthol smokers for CPD (-6.4 vs. -9.3), TNE (ratio of geometric means, 0.22 vs. 0.10) and CEMA (ratio, 0.56 vs. 0.37; ps < .05), and trended toward a smaller treatment effect for CO (-4.5 vs. -7.3 ppm; p = .06). Odds ratios for abstinence at week 20 were 1.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8 to 4.4) for menthol and 9.11 (95% CI = 3.3 to 25.2) for non-menthol VLNC smokers (p = .02) relative to the NNC condition. CONCLUSIONS: Although menthol smokers experienced reductions in smoking, toxicant exposure, and increases in quitting when using VLNC cigarettes, the magnitude of change was smaller than that observed for non-menthol smokers. IMPLICATIONS: Results of this analysis suggest that smokers of menthol cigarettes may respond to a nicotine reduction policy with smaller reductions in smoking rates and toxicant exposure than would smokers of non-menthol cigarettes.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In the 1920s, tobacco companies created a marketing campaign for what would one day be their most profitable series of products: mentholated tobacco cigarettes. Menthol provides the smoker with a pleasant mint flavor in addition to a cooling sensation of the mouth, throat, and lungs, giving relief from the painful irritation caused by tobacco smoke. Promising a healthier cigarette using pictures of doctors in white coats and even cartoon penguins, tobacco companies promoted these cigarettes to young, beginner smokers and those with respiratory health concerns. Today, smoking tobacco cigarettes causes one in five US Americans to die prematurely, crowning it as the leading cause of preventable death. In contrast to the dubious health claims by tobacco companies, mentholated cigarettes are in fact more addictive. Smokers of mentholated cigarettes have lower successful quit rates and in some cases are resistant to both behavioral and pharmacological treatment strategies. There is now considerable evidence, especially in the last 5 years, that suggest menthol might influence the addictive potential of nicotine-containing tobacco products via biological mechanisms. First, menthol alters the expression, stoichiometry, and function of nicotinic receptors. Second, menthol's chemosensory properties operate to mask aversive properties of using tobacco products. Third, menthol's chemosensory properties aid in serving as a conditioned cue that can both enhance nicotine intake and drive relapse. Fourth, menthol alters nicotine metabolism, increasing its bioavailability. This review discusses emerging evidence for these mechanisms, with an emphasis on preclinical findings that may shed light on why menthol smokers exhibit greater dependence. IMPLICATIONS: Mentholated cigarettes have been shown to have greater addictive potential than their nonmentholated counterparts. Evidence is pointing toward multiple mechanisms of action by which menthol may alter tobacco dependence. Understanding menthol's biological functions as it pertains to nicotine dependence will be helpful in crafting novel pharmacotherapies that might better serve menthol smokers. In addition, a better understanding of menthol's pharmacology as it relates to tobacco dependence will be valuable for informing policy decisions on the regulation of mentholated cigarettes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study aimed at investigating the influence of 90% menthol-containing plant bioactive lipid compounds (PBLC, essential oils) on growth performance, blood haematological and biochemical profile, and nutrient absorption in sheep. Twenty-four growing Suffolk sheep were allotted into three dietary treatments: Control (without PBLC), lower dose of PBLC (PBLC-L; 80 mg/d) and higher dose of PBLC (PBLC-H; 160 mg/d). Sheep in all groups were fed meadow hay ad libitum plus 600 g/d of concentrate pellets for 28 d. RESULTS: Average daily gain was not affected by treatment. Feeding of PBLC increased hay and total feed intake per kg body weight (P < 0.05). Counts of total leucocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes were not different among treatments. However, neutrophil count decreased (P < 0.05) in PBLC-H with a similar trend in PBLC-L (P < 0.10). Concentrations of glucose, bilirubin, triglycerides, cholesterol, urea and magnesium in serum were not different among sheep fed different doses of PBLC. However, serum calcium concentration tended to increase in PBLC-H (P < 0.10) and serum concentrations of aspartate & asparagine (P < 0.01) and glutamate & glutamine (P < 0.05) increased linearly with increasing PBLC dose. In ruminal epithelia isolated from the rumen after killing, baseline conductance (G t; P < 0.05) and short-circuit current (I sc; P < 0.01) increased in both PBLC groups. Ruminal uptakes of glucose and methionine in the presence of Na+ were not affected by the dietary PBLC supplementation. In the absence of Na+, however, glucose and methionine uptakes increased (P < 0.05) in PBLC-H. In the jejunum, I sc tended to increase in PBLC-H (P < 0.10), but baseline G t was not affected. Intestinal uptakes of glucose and methionine were not influenced by PBLC in the presence or absence of Na+. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that menthol-rich PBLC increase feed intake, and passive ion and nutrient transport, the latter specifically in the rumen. They also increased serum concentrations of urea precursor amino acids and tended to increase serum calcium concentrations. Future studies will have to show whether some of these findings might be commonly linked to a stimulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the gastrointestinal tract."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Use of menthol cigarettes remains highly prevalent among African American smokers and has increased among White and Hispanic/Latino smokers. Research is needed to examine if behavioral factors, such as marijuana use, are differentially associated with menthol cigarette use among racially/ethnically diverse samples of marijuana users. METHODS: Using data from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, this study examined the association between past month marijuana (blunt versus non-blunt) and cigarette (non-menthol cigarette versus menthol cigarette versus no cigarette) use, as well as racial/ethnic differences in this relationship. RESULTS: Among all marijuana users (N = 5,137), 34.1% smoked blunts, 28.7% smoked non-menthol cigarettes and 18.0% smoked menthol cigarettes, with the highest rates of blunt (63.8%) and menthol cigarette (38.9%) use found among African American adults. Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed a significant association between blunt use and non-menthol cigarette use (versus non-use) and menthol cigarette use (versus non-menthol cigarette and no cigarette use) among the full sample. When stratified by race/ethnicity, this finding was consistent for non-Hispanic White (n = 3,492) and partially consistent for Hispanic/Latino (n = 839) adults. However, among African American adults (n = 806), blunt use was not significantly associated with non-menthol cigarette use or menthol cigarette use. DISCUSSION: Blunt use is associated with increased odds of non-menthol and menthol cigarette use, but only among Hispanic/Latino and White adults. Examining racial/ethnic differences in the association between marijuana and tobacco use is important to understanding disparities and informing prevention and treatment interventions and drug policies.",
