      "abstract": "Background: A remarkable increase in metabolic comorbidities occur in people living with HIV infection (PLWH). Supervised physical activity provides significant health benefits. Ginkgo biloba (GKB) extract has been reported to have a wide range of metabolic advantages. This study aimed to examine the effects of an exercise training (ET) program and a GKB extract on PLWH. Methods: This was a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study. Twenty-eight PLWH were assigned to receive a placebo (n = 10), GKB extract (n = 10), or statins (n = 8). All patients underwent a supervised ET program 3-5 times per week. Anthropometric measurements, functional capacities, and metabolic parameters were assessed in all participants at baseline and after 12 weeks of follow-up. Results: After the 12-week intervention, body fat decreased significantly by 2-3% in all groups relative to their baseline values (p < 0.05). Total cholesterol and LDL-c were significantly decreased in the ET + statin group (p = 0.04, and p = 0.007, respectively) compared to baseline values, while HbA1c and the HOMA-IR index were significantly decreased in the ET + GKB group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively) compared to baseline values, and a significant increase in CD4+ T cell mean was observed in the ET + placebo group (p = 0.005) compared to baseline values. A significant increase in cardiorespiratory capacity (VO2max) from their baseline values was observed in all groups (p < 0.001) after 12 weeks of intervention from their baseline values. Conclusions: Body fat and cardiorespiratory fitness significantly improved after a 12-week supervised ET program. GKB extract significantly decreased insulin resistance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder in which neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction plays a critical role. GBE50, a refined extract of Ginkgo biloba containing over 50 % total flavonoids and terpene lactones, is widely used in the clinical prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases due to its anti-platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. However, its specific effects on NVU integrity and cerebrovascular function in AD remain unclear. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of GBE50 on NVU integrity and cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model. METHODS: APP/PS1 transgenic mice were treated with GBE50 via intragastric administration for 10 weeks. Cognitive performance was assessed through behavioral tests, while the structural and functional integrity of the NVU was evaluated using immunofluorescence, laser speckle imaging, and in vivo multi-photon imaging. Furthermore, target prediction and transcriptomic analyses were conducted to uncover potential molecular mechanisms and identify specific targets of GBE50. RESULTS: GBE50 treatment significantly alleviated cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. It enhanced cerebrovascular structure and function by increasing vessel density, diameter, and branching, leading to improved cerebral blood flow (CBF). GBE50 also restored NVU components such as endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes, promoted parenchyma and perivascular Aβ clearance, and reduced neuroinflammation. Bioinformatics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that GBE50 exerted its effects by regulating pathways related to vascular repair, neuroprotection, and Aβ clearance. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that GBE50 improves cognitive dysfunction in AD by restoring NVU integrity and cerebrovascular function through multi-target mechanisms. This study highlights the potential of GBE50 as a promising therapeutic approach for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases involved in cerebrovascular dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba is widely used in some regions as an adjunct therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its potential mechanisms include antioxidative and anti-amyloid properties, yet clinical evidence remains mixed. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether combining Ginkgo with donepezil confers additional benefits in amyloid PET-positive AD patients. We also explored changes in the plasma biomarker MDS-Oaβ (Multimer Detection System-Oligomeric Aβ), which reflects the propensity of Aβ monomers to form oligomers. METHODS: This retrospective study included newly diagnosed, drug-naïve AD patients who were amyloid PET-positive and had at least 12 months of follow-up. Participants received either donepezil alone (Donepezil-only) or donepezil plus Ginkgo (Donepezil-Ginkgo). Clinical measures included the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and the Sum of Boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB). Plasma MDS-Oaβ was assessed at baseline and at 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were analyzed (60 Donepezil-only, 41 Donepezil-Ginkgo). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar. After 12 months, the Donepezil-only group showed minimal change in K-MMSE and a slight decrease in MDS-Oaβ. The Donepezil-Ginkgo group demonstrated a significant improvement in K-MMSE (+2.4) and a larger reduction in MDS-Oaβ (-0.15). No significant between-group difference was observed for CDR-SB. Adverse events were mostly mild and did not lead to discontinuation. CONCLUSION: The addition of Ginkgo to donepezil may yield superior cognitive outcomes and a greater decrease in plasma MDS-Oaβ compared with donepezil alone in amyloid PET-positive AD patients. Further large-scale, prospective trials are warranted to validate these findings and elucidate Ginkgo's mechanistic role in AD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba leaf extract EGb 761® might have diverse therapeutic effects. OBJECTIVE: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) to compile the efficacy and safety of EGb 761®. METHODS: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via OVID) and PROSPERO were searched from inception until July 25th, 2023 with an update on January 30th, 2025. SRs were included if they evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral treatment with EGb 761® under any clinical condition or in healthy subjects for clinical reasons, such as prevention, or for health promotion. Two authors carried out screening, selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (AMSTAR 2). The degree of overlap was quantified. The overview was registered a priori (PROSPERO: CRD42023423789). RESULTS: We screened 126 articles and included reviews on neurocognitive disorders (n = 13), tinnitus, macular degeneration and schizophrenia (all n = 1). For neurocognitive disorders, most SRs were in favor of EGb 761® regarding cognition and behavioral and/or psychological symptoms, while the results for functional activities of daily living varied. EGb 761® might have positive effects on tinnitus, macular degeneration or schizophrenia: however, more evidence is needed. In general, EGb 761® appears to be safe. Methodological quality was poor in all SRs. The overall overlap of the primary studies on neurocognitive disorders was very high, and pairwise overlap varied. CONCLUSION: EGb 761® has been studied in various reviews, particularly regarding neurocognitive disorders and has been reported to be safe in many SRs. The results must be treated with caution due to the poor quality of the SRs.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of GBE in the treatment of IPF by evaluating its impact on total effective rate, blood gas analysis, pulmonary function tests, and markers of inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search across seven databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang DATA, VIP, and CBM, without restrictions on publication date. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of GBE on IPF patients were eligible for inclusion. Relevant literature was screened, and the data in the included studies were extracted for quality assessment according to the Risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of 14 RCTs involving 1043 patients were included in the analysis. GBE significantly improved the total effective rate, arterial oxygen partial pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, maximum voluntary ventilation, and 6-min walk test compared to the control group. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, interleukin-4, hyaluronan, and laminin levels. CONCLUSION: GBE may offer therapeutic benefits in IPF by improving respiratory function, modulating inflammation, and affecting fibrosis markers. These findings support the potential use of GBE as an adjunct therapy in IPF and suggest that further large-scale, multicenter trials are warranted to confirm its efficacy and safety."

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major challenge in the medical community because of its difficulty in treatment and poor prognosis. Extract of ginkgo biloba (EGb) has been widely used in the prevention and treatment of age-related neurosensory disease, which is considered to have the effect of neuroprotection. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the neurobiological roles of EGb for treating SCI in rats. Pubmed, Embase, Sinomed and China National knowledge Infrastructure were searched from their inception dates to April 2024, and 30 articles were included. The quality score of the included studies ranged from 4 to 7 out of 10 points, and all of them were randomization. It was shown that after SCI, EGb administration could significantly improve motor function (WMD = 2.09 [1.59, 2.59], p < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis concluded that EGb at the doses of 10-50 mg/kg improved the motor function to the greatest extent. In comparison with the control group, EGb administration could reduce lipid peroxidation and inhibit inflammation (MDA: SMD = -1.43 [-5.05,2.20], p < 0.00001; iNOS: WMD = -22.17 [-35.45, -8.90], p < 0.00001). In addition, this review suggested that EGb can antagonize inflammation, reduce oxidative stress to inhibit the lipid peroxidation and resistance to apoptosis, promote nerve growth and reduce myelin loss on SCI. Preclinical grade suggests that, collectively, EGb may be a promising natural neuroprotective agent on SCI with unique advantages and mechanisms of action. More clinical randomized, blind controlled trials are also needed to confirm the neuroprotective effect of EGb on SCI."

      "abstract": "Leaf nitrogen allocation plays a crucial role in determining both photosynthetic function and structural development of plants. However, the effects of drought, salt stress, and their combination on leaf nitrogen allocation, and how these affect mesophyll conductance (g m) and photosynthesis, remain poorly understood. In this study, we first investigated variations in photosynthetic characteristics and leaf nitrogen allocation, and analyzed the relationship between g m and leaf nitrogen allocation ratios in Ginkgo biloba under drought, salt and combined drought-salt stress. The results showed that all stress treatments significantly reduced the photosynthesis in G. biloba, with the combined drought-salt stress having the most significant inhibitory effect on the plant's physiological characteristics. Under combined drought-salt stress, the limitation of photosynthesis due to g m (MC L) was significantly greater than under individual drought or salt stress. In contrast, the limitation due to stomatal conductance (S L) was similar to that observed under drought but higher than under salt stress. No significant differences in biochemical limitations (B L) were found across all stress treatments. Further research suggests that the increase in MC L under combined drought-stress treatment may be linked to a greater allocation of leaf nitrogen to non-photosynthetic apparatus (e.g., cell structure) and a smaller allocation to photosynthetic enzymes (i.e., ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, Rubisco). This is supported by the positive correlation between g m and the proportion of nitrogen allocated to the carboxylation system (P r), as well as the negative correlation with the non-photosynthetic nitrogen ratio (P np). These findings help to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis and plant adaptability under combined drought-salt stress."

Numerous pharmaceutical options have been investigated, but satisfactory results are yet to be obtained. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to study and compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of caroverine alone, caroverine combined with ginkgo biloba and betahistine alone in patients of moderate tinnitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, observational, hospital-based study, wherein 72 patients were distributed equally across three groups - Group A received caroverine 20 mg twice daily, Group B received caroverine 20 mg combined with ginkgo biloba 120 mg twice daily, and Group C received betahistine 8 mg thrice daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy was zanalyzed assessing the changes in tinnitus handicap inventory (THI), tinnitus functional index (TFI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and pure tone audiometry values from baseline at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The cost-effectiveness analysis was done at the end of 12 weeks zutilizing the incremental costeffectiveness ratio. The Chi-square test and one-way ANOVA were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. RESULTS: The reduction in the THI, TFI and VAS scores was maximum in Group B followed by Group A and Group C. All the drugs were well-tolerated, and the adverse effects encountered were mild and nonserious. Combination therapy of caroverine with gingkgo biloba was the most expensive. CONCLUSION: Caroverine and ginkgo biloba combination therapy was the most effective in reducing the handicap of moderate tinnitus.",

DESIGN: Clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen patients with early-to-moderate (≥10 dB MD) primary open-angle glaucoma were matched to 17 control patients based on age, sex, and glaucoma status. A total sample size of 34 was determined for effect size 0.5, alpha 0.05, power 0.81, and critical t = 2.03. Normality was confirmed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. METHODS: The intervention was 120 mg oral GBE twice daily for 4 months. OCT-A scans (15° × 15°) of the macula and peripapillary retina were acquired, two-dimensional projection slab images of the superficial vascular complex were exported, and image analysis was performed. Student's t test was used to compare perfusion density between groups, and between baseline and follow-up for each group. The main outcomes were perfusion density of the superficial vascular complex of the macula and the peripapillary region. RESULTS: Comparison between baseline and 4 months' supplementation with GBE revealed no significant change in perfusion density in the macular area, 0.32 (0.04) versus 0.30 (0.04); p = 0.17, and was significantly lower in the peripapillary area, 0.44 (0.05) versus 0.42 (0.04); p = 0.02. No differences were observed in the control group. CONCLUSION: Four-month supplementation with GBE did not result in clinically significant improvement in macula or peripapillary perfusion density in patients with treated early-to-moderate primary open-angle glaucoma. Larger studies are needed to confirm an absence of neuroprotective effects of GBE."

This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which GBE improves AIS prognosis, particularly its impact on platelet activity, coagulation function, and the potential risk of bleeding. METHODS: This real-world study consecutively enrolled 99 patients: 49 with internal jugular venous stenosis (IJVS) treated with GBE; 33 with AIS treated with GBE and low-dose aspirin; and 17 with AIS treated with low-dose aspirin alone. Plasma platelet aggregation and coagulation status were assessed before and after treatment. Major and minor bleeding events were recorded in the AIS group. RESULTS: In the IJVS group, GBE specifically inhibited arachidonic acid (AA)-induced, but not ADP-induced, platelet aggregation, along with prolonged thrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). In the AIS group, the combined use of low-dose aspirin and GBE further reduced AA-induced platelet aggregation, mildly prolonged APTT, and was associated with an increased risk of minor bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of GBE in AIS may, in part, be attributed to its ability to enhance the antiplatelet action of aspirin, particularly in inhibiting AA-induced platelet aggregation. However, the potential for increased bleeding risk warrants further investigation."

Thus, there is a need for safe and well-tolerated treatments that can be initiated at the earliest stages. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis of clinical trials aimed to assess the treatment effects of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 in patients with mild dementia. METHODS: Eligible randomised placebo-controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. Data of patients with mild dementia (defined as the SKT Short Cognitive Performance Test total scores from 9 to 15) were selected. RESULTS: The meta-analysis was performed with pooled data from four eligible trials comprising 782 patients with mild dementia. Treatment with 240 mg EGb 761 daily was significantly superior to placebo in cognition (p = 0.04), global assessment (p = 0.01), activities of daily living (p = 0.01) and quality of life (p = 0.02). Standardised effects were medium to large. The frequency of adverse events was alike in patients treated with EGb 761 and placebo (p = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis demonstrates that patients with mild dementia benefit from EGb 761 in terms of cognition, activities of daily living, global assessment and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the clinical efficacy of Ginkgo biloba combined with Nicorandil in patients with heart failure who have a mild decrease in ejection fraction (HFmrEF).A total of 316 patients with HFmrEF were selected and randomly assigned to either a control group or a combination of the Ginkgo biloba and Nicorandil group, each group consisting of 158 patients. The control group received standard secondary preventive treatment, while patients in the combination group received oral Ginkgo biloba and Nicorandil based on stable conventional treatment. Both groups were treated continuously for six months. The age, sex, body mass index (BMI), New York Heart Association cardiac function classification, history of coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, smoking, left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF), heart rate, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and combined drug use of the patients in the two groups were recorded. The efficacy endpoints were BMI, heart rate, blood lipid levels, fasting blood glucose, renal function, HbA1c, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), LVEF, cardiopulmonary exercise testing parameters, 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score after six months of treatment. The incidence of adverse reactions in the two groups was recorded.After six months of treatment, the BMI, heart rate, NT-proBNP, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, creatinine, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c levels of patients in the Ginkgo biloba combined with Nicorandil group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The LVEF, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, VO2peak, oxygen uptake efficiency slope, 6MWD, and KCCQ scores were higher in the Ginkgo biloba combined with Nicorandil group than in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (P > 0.05) in the incidence of hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, headache, and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure.Ginkgo biloba combined with Nicorandil can effectively improve heart function, blood lipid levels, blood glucose levels, renal function, exercise tolerance, and health-related quality of life in patients with HFmrEF. Because there were no significant adverse reactions, they can be safely used.",

      "abstract": "Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are pivotal for cholinergic signaling in the neocortex and hippocampal formation, crucially implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), recognition memory impairments, and decision-making. The acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is essential for loading acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles. Building on our previous findings showing that Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) preserves recognition memory, we hypothesized EGb would enhance memory in female mice with varying VAChT reductions. We also explored whether reduced cholinergic signaling induces anxiety-like behavior and whether EGb could alleviate such symptoms. Three-month-old female mice with severe VAChT reduction (knockdown homozygotes; VAChT KDHOM), moderate reduction (heterozygotes; VAChT KDHET), and wild-type (WT) mice received the vehicle, 5 mg/kg Donepezil, or EGb at doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg for 30 days. Memory assessments included aversive tasks like discriminative avoidance memory and non-aversive tasks like object recognition and location memory. We assessed VAChT protein expression in the hippocampal formation (HF) using Western blotting and quantified VAChT-immunopositive cells (IR+) in specific HF subfields (dCA1, dCA3, dDG) using immunohistochemistry. Chronic EGb treatment significantly improved long-term memory in female VAChT KDHOM mice in object recognition and locations memories in a dose-dependent manner, unlike Donepezil. Enhanced memory was correlated with an increase in VAChT-IR+ cells in the dCA1 of VAChT KDHOM mice. Additionally, EGb reduced VAChT-IR+ cells in the dDG of VAChT KDHET mice, which was associated with decreased anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest that EGb effectively mitigates deficits caused by cholinergic deficiency in hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation, thereby improving our understanding of its role in modulating long-term memory and hippocampal plasticity.",

      "abstract": "Ginkgolic acids (GAs) are distinctive secondary metabolites of Ginkgo biloba (G. biloba) primarily found in its leaves and seeds, with the highest concentration located in the exotesta. GAs are classified as long-chain phenolic compounds, and exhibit structural similarities to lignoceric acid. Their structural diversity arises from variations in the length of side chains and their number of double bonds, resulting in six distinct forms within G. biloba extracts (GBE). Of these, GA (C15:1) is the most prevalent. As inhibitors of SUMOylation, GAs demonstrate significant antitumor activity, and can exert antineoplastic effects through multiple pathways, which positions them as potentially promising therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. Additionally, GAs exhibit notable anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties, highlighting their multifaceted medicinal potential. Although the pharmacological properties of GAs have been extensively investigated, the associated risks of liver and kidney damage must not be overlooked. GAs can induce significant hepatic damage by promoting cellular apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the disruption of various metabolic processes. Furthermore, a limited number of studies have indicated that GAs may exhibit nephrotoxicity, as well as adverse effects on the skin and nervous system. Due to their recognized toxicity, the concentration of GAs is typically regulated to within 5[Formula: see text]ppm in the standardized G. biloba leaf extract EGb 761. Currently, there is no definitive evidence supporting the mutagenic toxicity of GAs. This review primarily synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the pharmacological and toxicological effects of GAs, along with their underlying mechanisms. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate scholarly discourse and elicit valuable insights.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the world. However, the current conventional approaches have not yet achieved satisfactory efficacy. As one of the most influential products in botanical medicine, Ginkgo biloba L. leaves extract (GBE) demonstrates various pharmacological effects on DKD and is gradually used as an adjunctive therapy for this disease. A comprehensive analysis is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GBE as an adjuvant treatment for DKD. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GBE as a supplementary treatment to conventional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors for DKD patients, providing a reference for subsequent research and clinical practice. METHODS: This study has been registered in PROSPERO as CRD42023455792. Ten databases were searched from their inception to 21 July 2023. Randomized controlled trials about GBE and DKD were included. Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 16.0 were employed to conduct the analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed through the χ2 test and the I2 test, and the effect model was chosen accordingly. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were performed to investigate the sources of heterogeneity and the influence of different factor levels on efficacy. The publication bias was evaluated with the funnel plot and Egger's test, and the evidence quality was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method. RESULTS: A total of 41 studies with 3,269 patients were finally enrolled in this study. None of the included studies reported whether renal or cardiovascular disease progression events occurred. Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) alone, the combination with GBE was more beneficial in improving urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) [mean difference (MD) = -22.99 μg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI): -27.66 to -18.31, p < 0.01], serum creatinine (SCr) [MD = -8.30 μmol/L, 95% CI: -11.55 to -5.05, p < 0.01], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [MD = -0.77 mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.04 to -0.49, p < 0.01], 24-hour urinary total protein (24hUTP) [MD = -0.28 g/d, 95% CI: -0.35 to -0.22, p < 0.01], cystatin C (Cys-C) [MD = -0.30 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.43 to -0.17, p < 0.01], total cholesterol (TC) [MD = -0.69 mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.01 to -0.38, p < 0.01], triglyceride (TG) [MD = -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.23, p < 0.01], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [MD = -0.97 mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.28 to -0.65, p < 0.01], fasting blood glucose (FBG) [MD = -0.30 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.05, p = 0.02], hematocrit [MD = -4.58%, 95% CI: -5.25 to -3.90, p < 0.01] and fibrinogen [MD = -0.80 g/L, 95% CI: -1.12 to -0.47, p < 0.01]. No significant improvement was found in 2-hour postprandial glucose (2hPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). No significant difference was detected in adverse events. CONCLUSION: Combining GBE with ACEI/ARB may improve UAER, SCr, BUN, 24hUTP, Cys-C, TC, TG, LDL-C, hematocrit and fibrinogen in DKD patients. It also seems beneficial for oxidative stress and inflammation but has minimal impact on glucose and blood pressure. Combined GBE therapy is generally tolerated, but safety monitoring remains essential during its use. More long-term high-quality clinical studies and in-depth molecular research are still necessary to provide stronger evidence regarding the benefits and safety of GBE in DKD.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba leaf extract EGb 761® has shown clinical efficacy in patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the pharmacological action of EGb 761® in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear and molecular mechanisms targeted in the brain are not completely understood. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate 1) the potential sex-dependent effects of oral administration of EGb 761® in 5xFAD mice, an AD mouse model, and 2) the underlying microglial subtype responsible for the observed anti-inflammatory effects in the brain. METHODS: Eight-week old 5xFAD and wild type mice received EGb 761®-supplemented diet or control diet for eight weeks. The study investigated changes in cognitive function as well as amyloid plaque load, expression of AD-related genes, and anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, we used organotypic brain slices for confirmation and assessment of concentration-dependency of the observed EGb 761® effects and performed single cell RNA sequencing on the prefrontal cortex of male mice with focus on microglia. RESULTS: We demonstrate that EGb 761® treatment improves cognitive function in 5xFAD mice in several behavioral tests. Analysis of the brain tissue from these animals indicated a reduction in amyloid plaque load in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This brain area was further investigated to assess the molecular changes that occurred following EGb 761® intake. Alterations in the expression of genes related to AD were highly sex-specific with effects on the cholinergic system, the γ-secretase complex, and neuroinflammation. Anti-inflammatory effects of EGb 761® with a particularly pronounced reduction of the TNFα-response could be shown for the PFC but also peripherally in the serum of 5xFAD mice of both sexes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that EGb761® mainly affected disease-associated microglia stage 2 (DAM2), which are thought to have a detrimental role in AD. CONCLUSIONS: EGb 761® shows efficacy in the treatment of cognitive deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model via multimodal activity, including sex-specific and sex-unrelated mechanisms including the normalization of neuroinflammatory parameters.",

      "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VD) is a neurocognitive disorder resulting from cerebral vascular disorders, leading to the demise of neurons and cognitive deficits, posing significant health concerns globally. Derived from Ginkgo biloba leaves, EGb761 is a potent bioactive compound widely recognized for its benefits in treating cerebrovascular diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that the administration of EGb761 to VD rats enhances the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neurons, effectively alleviating cognitive dysfunction. However, the specific mechanisms by which EGb761 exerts its remedial influence on VD persist in ambiguity. This investigation utilized an integrated approach incorporating network pharmacology with experimental procedures on HT-22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells amidst oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) to delve into certain repercussions of EGb761 on cell proliferation and migration. Results revealed that ras homolog family member A (RHOA) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) are potential targets of Ginkgo biloba leaves. Target genes are mainly enriched in pathways including those involved in growth hormone synthesis, secretion and action and the neurotrophin signalling pathway. Cellular experiments further demonstrated that the application of EGb761 notably enhanced the viability, proliferation, and migration of HT22 cells subjected to OGD/R through RhoA-ROCK2 pathway. In conclusion, our findings indicated that EGb761 significantly enhances neuronal proliferation and migration following OGD/R injury by targeting the RhoA-ROCK2 signalling pathway, thus offering valuable insights into its potential as a treatment for VD.",

Although GBE has been extensively studied in the prevention and treatment of lung diseases, its mechanism of action in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear. In the present study, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and cigarette smoke (CS) were used to induce COPD in cell and animal models. The expression of related genes and proteins was detected, and cell damage and lung tissue damage were evaluated via CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry analyses, ELISA, and HE staining. In HBE cells, the expression of miR-3,619-5p was upregulated after CSE induction. However, GBE treatment alleviated the impact of CSE on HBE cell damage and alleviated COPD in vivo. In addition, GBE treatment increased the expression of GPX4 by inhibiting the expression of miR-3,619-5p, and it reduced the release of the IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α inflammatory factors. Moreover, GBE treatment decreased the production of ROS and MDA, as well as decreased the expression of the ferroptosis-related protein ACSL4, and it promoted the production of GSH and the expression of FTH1. Further, GBE treatment improved cell viability, inhibited ferroptosis, and ultimately alleviated COPD. The present findings suggest that GBE alleviates the progression of COPD through the inhibitory effect of the miR-3,619-5p/GPX4 axis on the ferroptosis process and that GBE may be an effective treatment option for COPD."

Stomatal reconstruction of palaeo-[CO2] during global greenhouse periods or episodes of global warming, are particularly important to our understanding of the role of CO2 as a climate system driver. However, the efficacy of the 'stomatal method' for palaeo-[CO2] reconstruction depends upon the strength of the inverse relationship between stomatal number and the [CO2] in which the leaf developed. However, the impact of heat stress on stomatal initiation and development are largely unknown. Ginkgo biloba, a living fossil species, seedlings were grown in controlled environment chambers under 20/25 °C and 30/35 °C night/day temperature regimes. Heat stress in the 30/35 °C treatment impaired photosynthetic function, decreased stomatal conductance (Gs), and reduced stomatal index (SI), indicative of lower stomatal initiation. Modelled theoretical Gs did not correlate with observed measured Gs, undermining the utility of palaeo-[CO2] reconstructions based on stomatal diffusion modelling. The lower stomatal initiation of G. biloba leaves from the higher temperature resulted in greater estimates of [CO2] based on SI values using the nearest living equivalent and SI-[CO2] transfer function approaches. Heat stress may diminish the effectiveness of the stomatal method in reconstructing palaeo-[CO2] during intervals of global warming marked by floral turnover in Earth history.",

Limited data exist regarding adverse drug reactions associated with Ginkgo biloba extract post-marketing. AIM OF THE STUDY: Currently, the drug safety profile of Ginkgo biloba extract is assessed using a substantial volume of case safety reports within the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study collected adverse events (AEs) data associated with Ginkgo biloba extract as the primary suspected drug from 2004 to 2023 from the FAERS database. A standardized mapping analysis of System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) was conducted. Utilizing reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), information component (IC), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM), significant disproportionate measurement signals of adverse drug reactions (ADR) were identified and high-intensity signals were analyzed. RESULTS: 700 reports of adverse events related to Ginkgo biloba extract were found in the FAERS database, affecting 23 organ systems. 88 significant mismatches were identified using four algorithms, leading to unexpected major adverse events like amaurosis fugax, fractional exhaled nitric oxide created, and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. The study observed a median onset time of AE associated with Ginkgo biloba extract at 7 days (interquartile interval [IQR] 0-109 days), with the majority of AE manifesting within the initial 7 days of drug treatment initiation. This investigation identified a noteworthy AE signal for Ginkgo biloba extract, underscoring the importance of clinical surveillance and risk assessment in its use. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, this study provides a deeper and broader understanding of suspected adverse reactions associated with Ginkgo biloba extract.",

      "abstract": "Extracts made from plants are complex mixtures of substances with varying compositions depending on the plant material and method of manufacture. This complexity makes it difficult for scientists and clinicians to interpret findings from pharmacological and clinical research. We performed a narrative review summarizing information on ginkgo biloba leaf extract, its composition, pharmacological data and clinical evidence supporting its administration for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Medicinal products containing ginkgo biloba leaf extract which are manufactured in compliance with the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia are approved as medicinal products for the treatment of dementia and related conditions by drug regulatory agencies in Europe, Asia and South America. As multicomponent mixtures, they may affect various targets in the pathogenesis of AD, the most common form of dementia. Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrate the effects of EGb 761 and individual constituents on various pathophysiological features of experimentally induced cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration that could contribute to its clinical efficacy. The safety and efficacy in the treatment of AD and cognitive decline has been studied in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Most of the studies that investigate the effects of ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) used the special extract EGb 761, which makes it the best-researched plant preparation worldwide. It is therefore the only herbal alternative to standard-of-care anti-dementia drugs. However, the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated yet, and the clinical studies in AD show heterogeneity.",

      "abstract": "Terpene trilactones (TTLs) have important medicinal value, but their low content in Ginkgo biloba leaves makes their exploitation extremely costly, thereby limiting the development of TTL-related industries. It was found that exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased the accumulation of TTLs, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Here, we identified two bHLH transcription factors in G. biloba, with the protein subcellular localizations in the nucleus. Expression of GbMYC2s was strongly induced by MeJA treatment, and the interactions between GbJAZs and GbMYC2s were demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments. Overexpression of GbMYC2_4 and GbMYC2_5 enhanced Arabidopsis root sensitivity and significantly increased TTL content. In addition, GbGGPPS was found to be a common target of GbMYC2_4 and GbMYC2_5 by yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual-luciferase reporter assays and DAP-seq, and they achieved regulation of GbGGPPS by binding to the G-box. Further findings revealed that GbMYC2_4 and GbMYC2_5 bind the G-box not universally but selectively. Our study revealed that jasmonic acid signaling mediates TTL biosynthesis through the GbJAZ-GbMYC2-GbGGPPS module, which enriches the terpenoid biosynthesis regulatory networks and provides a research basis and target genes for enhancing TTL content through genetic engineering."

      "abstract": "Ginkgo biloba, usually referred to as a \"living fossil,\" is widely planted in many countries because of its medicinal value and beautiful appearance. Owing to ginkgo's high resistance to drought stress, ginkgo seedlings can even survive withholding water for several days without exhibiting leaf wilting and desiccation. To assess the physiological and transcriptomic mechanisms involved in the drought stress and re-watering responses of Ginkgo biloba, ginkgo seedlings were subjected to drought treatment for 15 d (D_15 d) and 22 d (D_22 d) until they had severely wilted, followed by re-watering for 3 d (D_Re3 d) to restore normal growth. Variations in physiological characteristics (relative water content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, stomatal aperture, and antioxidant enzyme activity) during drought and re-watering were assessed. In total, 1692, 2031, and 1038 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, while 1691, 2820, and 1910 were downregulated in D_15 d, D_22 d, and D_Re3 d, respectively, relative to the control. Three pathways, namely, plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, and the plant MAPK signaling pathway, were enriched during drought stress and re-watering. The DEGs involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathways (those of IAA, CTK, GA, ABA, ETH, BR, SA, and JA) and the major differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs; MYB, bHLH, AP2/ERF, NAC, WRKY, and bZIP) were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed six TFs as positive or negative regulators of drought stress response. These phenotype-related physiological characteristics, DEGs, pathways, and TFs provide valuable insights into the drought stress and re-watering responses in G. biloba."

Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) is used to establish the presence of the condition and determine symptom severity, its impact on the patient's quality of life, thus in this study, we aim to compare the efficacy of caroverine and Ginkgo Biloba in the management of idiopathic tinnitus using TFI. METHODS: This clinical study was conducted in at a tertiary care hospital in North India, for a duration of one year, among patients with chronic tinnitus. The sample size for this study consisted of 60 patients in each of three groups (caroverine, gingko biloba, and multivitamin). Assessments of TFI and pure-tone audiometry were performed to evaluate the efficacy of the two medications. The information pertaining to the subjects was kept anonymous and confidential. During data analysis, an association was significant for p value < 0.05. RESULTS: The patients in three groups were matched for the age, gender and duration of tinnitus. At 6 months of medication with Ginkgo Biloba, patients experienced a significant (p < 0.0001) decrease of 50.0% in tinnitus of moderate severity, and a complete resolution of severe tinnitus symptoms with a percentage change of -100.0%. CONCLUSION: In our study, Ginkgo Biloba Group has significantly improved the severity of idiopathic tinnitus. Tinnitus has diverse underlying mechanisms, can be a symptom of various underlying diseases, and is challenging to measure. Further research is warranted to validate and explore these treatment options further."

METHODS: The clinical data of patients diagnosed with SSNHL and admitted to the Wendeng Hospital of Traditional Chinese Orthopedics and Traumatology of Shandong Province from May 2020 to May 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Based on different clinical treatment protocols, patients were divided into a control group (treated with routine treatment) and an administration group (treated with routine treatment + EGb 761). Both groups underwent drug treatment for 10 days. Subsequently, the hearing threshold, hemorheological parameters (blood high shear viscosity, blood low shear viscosity, plasma viscosity, and platelet aggregation rate) and inflammatory factors and serum levels (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) of these groups were compared. RESULTS: This study comprised 120 patients, with 66 cases in the control group and 54 cases in the administration group. Following treatment, the total effective rate of the administration group was significantly higher than that of the control group (90.74% vs. 72.73%) (P-value < 0.05). The hearing threshold, hemorheological parameters, inflammatory factors, and serum levels were significantly lower in the administration group than in the control group (P-value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with routine treatment, joint EGb 761 in the SSNHL treatment may improve the hearing threshold and hemorheological indexes of patients, inhibit the inflammatory response, and promote the recovery of hearing function. Moreover, no serious adverse reactions are observed, indicating adequate safety.",

Ginkgo leaves have been utilized as raw materials for medicines and health products due to their rich active ingredient composition, especially flavonoids. Since the routine measurement of total flavones is time-consuming and destructive, rapid, non-destructive detection of total flavones in ginkgo leaves is of significant importance to producers and consumers. Hyperspectral imaging technology is a rapid and non-destructive technique for determining the total flavonoid content. In this study, we discuss five modeling methods, and three spectral preprocessing methods are discussed. Bayesian Ridge (BR) and multiplicative scatter correction (MCS) were selected as the best model and the best pretreatment method, respectively. The spectral prediction results based on the BR + MCS treatment were very accurate (RTest2 = 0.87; RMSETest = 1.03 mg/g), showing a high correlation with the analytical measurements. In addition, we also found that the more and deeper the leaf cracks, the higher the flavonoid content, which helps to evaluate leaf quality more quickly and easily. In short, hyperspectral imaging is an effective technique for rapid and accurate determination of total flavonoids in ginkgo leaves and has great potential for developing an online quality detection system for ginkgo leaves.",

METHODS: Key chemical components of GBE, including quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol, were identified using network pharmacology methods. Bioinformatics analysis revealed their potential roles in AD through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway. RESULTS: Mouse experiments demonstrated that GBE improved cognitive function, enhanced neuronal morphology, and reduced serum inflammatory factors. Additionally, GBE modulated the expression of relevant proteins and mRNA. CONCLUSION: GBE shows promise as a potential treatment for AD. Its beneficial effects on cognitive function, neuronal morphology, and inflammation may be attributed to its modulation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings provide experimental evidence for the application of Ginkgo biloba leaf in AD treatment and highlight its potential mechanisms of action.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether Ginkgo biloba L. extract (Gbex) has a protective role against TFS-induced phytotoxicity, genotoxicity and oxidative damage in A. cepa. Different groups were formed from Allium cepa L. bulbs subjected to tap water (control), 200 mg/L Gbex (Gbex1), 400 mg/L Gbex (Gbex2), 0.8 g/L TFS solution (TFS), 200 mg/L Gbex + 0.8 g/L TFS (TFS + Gbex1) and 400 mg/L Gbex + 0.8 g/L TFS (TFS + Gbex2), respectively. The phenolic composition of Gbex and alterations in the morphological, physiological, biochemical, genotoxicity and anatomical parameters were evaluated. Rutin, protocatechuic acid, catechin, gallic acid, taxifolin, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin, syringic acid and quercetin were the most prevalent phenolic substances in Gbex. Rooting percentage, root elongation, weight gain, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b decreased by approximately 50%, 85%, 77%, 55% and 70%, respectively, as a result of TFS treatment compared to the control. In the TFS group, the mitotic index fell by 28% compared to the control group, but chromosomal abnormalities, micronuclei frequency and tail DNA percentage increased. Fragment, vagrant chromosome, sticky chromosome, uneven chromatin distribution, bridge, vacuole-containing nucleus, reverse polarization and irregular mitosis were the chromosomal abnormalities observed in the TFS group. The levels of proline (2.17-fold) and malondialdehyde (2.71-fold), as well as the activities of catalase (2.75-fold) and superoxide dismutase (2.03-fold) were increased by TFS in comparison to the control. TFS-provoked meristematic disorders were damaged epidermis and cortex cells, flattened cell nucleus and thickened cortex cell wall. Gbex combined with TFS relieved all these TFS-induced stress signs in a dose-dependent manner. This investigation showed that Gbex can play protective role in A. cepa against the phytotoxicity, genotoxicity and oxidative damage caused by TFS. The results demonstrated that Gbex had this antioxidant and antigenotoxic potential owing to its high phenolic content.",

      "abstract": "The use of plant extracts as a potential cure for various conditions has moved from traditional medicine to evidence-based medicine. Skin diseases have been addressed since time immemorial using plant extracts through observational and traditional knowledge and passed on through generations. With the advent of modern techniques, the molecular mechanisms of action of plant extracts/isolates are being deciphered with more precision, and more nanomedicine-based therapies are being studied to improve their therapeutic efficacy and stability. The leaves and seeds of Ginkgo biloba (G. biloba), an ancient medicinal tree species, have been used in Chinese herbal medicine for thousands of years. G. biloba extracts have been widely studied as a neuroprotective and anti-ischaemic drug for ischaemia-reperfusion injuries in the heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, and other organs. However, the use of G. biloba can be accompanied with side effects and drug interactions. Although, there is now a growing interest for its use in skincare, the mechanisms of action of the extract are not fully understood and vital aspects of G. biloba, such as its neuroprotective and angiogenic properties contributing to the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and skin ageing, are yet to be investigated. This review critically discusses the mechanisms of action of different constituents of G. biloba extracts linked to their potential interference in the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases. In addition to its ability to act on oxidative stress, G. biloba can regulate angiogenesis through its compounds such as ginkgetin or ginkgolide K, which either inhibit aberrant angiogenesis in eczema/psoriasis or increase microcirculation during skin ageing. G. biloba may also contribute to the control of pruritus in atopic dermatitis via a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory mechanism by suppressing JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathways. This review also highlights nanomedicine strategies to decrease the side effects and enhance the efficacy of the extracts. Similar strategies have been successfully used for anticancer molecules in targeted chemotherapy and iron delivery in anaemia treatment."

In addition, we assessed whether the different drug treatments were associated with different frequencies of repeat visits to ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the IQVIA Disease Analyzer (DA) database. It included patients with an initial diagnosis of tinnitus between January 2005 and December 2021, treated by ENT specialists in Germany. RESULTS: Of 111,629 patients meeting all selection criteria, 51,205 received prescriptions of Gbe, 34,817 of systemic CSs, and 25,607 of PTXF. Gbe prescription was associated with significantly lower odds of a repeat consultation due to tinnitus compared to systemic CSs [odds ratio (OR) 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.95] as well as PTXF (OR 0.74; 95% CI: 0.72-0.77). This association was significant in both men and women and in some age groups. CONCLUSION: Gbe is the most frequently ENT specialist-prescribed drug for the treatment of acute tinnitus. It is associated with a reduced likelihood of patients consulting their ENT specialist for tinnitus again compared to systemic CSs and PTXF."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory processes in the brain can exert important neuroprotective functions. However, in neurological and psychiatric disorders, it is often detrimental due to chronic microglial over-activation and the dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines. Growing evidence indicates the emerging yet prominent pathophysiological role of neuroinflammation in the development and progression of these disorders. Despite recent advances, there is still a pressing need for effective therapies, and targeting neuroinflammation is a promising approach. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of a marketed and quantified proprietary herbal extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves called EGb 761 (10-500 µg/mL) in BV2 microglial cells stimulated by LPS (10 ng/mL). Our results demonstrate significant inhibition of LPS-induced expression and release of cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and chemokines C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2), CXCL10, c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and CCL3 in BV2 microglial cells. The observed effects are possibly mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, as well as the protein kinase C (PKC) and the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling cascades. The findings of this in vitro study highlight the anti-inflammatory properties of EGb 761 and its therapeutic potential, making it an emerging candidate for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases and warranting further research in pre-clinical and clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Herbal-based medications have been used as therapeutic agents for thousands of years, particularly in Asian cultures. It is now well established that these herbal medications contain potent bioactive phytochemicals which exert a plethora of beneficial effects such as those seen on the cardiovascular system. Among the most widely studied of these herbal agents is ginseng, a member of the genus Panax, which has been shown to produce beneficial effects in terms of reducing cardiac pathology, at least in experimental studies. The beneficial effects of ginseng observed in such studies are likely attributable to their constituent ginsenosides, which are steroid-like saponins of which there are at least 100 and which vary according to ginseng species. Many ginseng species such as Panax ginseng (also known as Asian ginseng) and P quinquefolius (North American ginseng) as well as specific ginsenosides have been shown to attenuate hypertrophy as well as other indices of myocardial remodeling in a wide variety of experimental models. Ginkgo biloba on the other hand has been much less studied although the leaf extract of the ancient ginkgo tree has similarly consistently been shown to produce anti-remodeling effects. Ginkgo's primary bioactive constituents are thought to be terpene trilactones called ginkgolides, of which there are currently seven known types. Ginkgo and ginkgolides have also been shown to produce anti-remodeling effects as have been shown for ginseng in a variety of experimental models, in some cases via similar mechanisms. Although a common single mechanism for the salutary effects of these compounds is unlikely, there are a number of examples of shared effects including antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects as well as inhibition of pro-hypertrophic intracellular signaling such as that involving the calcineurin pathway which results in the upregulation of pro-hypertrophic genes. Robust clinical evidence represented by large scale phase 3 trials is lacking although there is limited supporting evidence from small trials at least with respect to ginseng. Taken together, both ginseng and ginkgo as well as their bioactive components offer potential as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of myocardial remodeling and heart failure."

Clinical data from 551 patients with Parkinson's disease admitted to the Neurology Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Beihua University from January 2022 to December 2022 were retrospectively collected. Cognitive function and daily living abilities were assessed in patients before treatment, and a reevaluation was conducted after 12 weeks of medication. Patients treated solely with nimodipine were categorized into the monotherapy group, while patients treated with nimodipine combined with Ginkgo biloba extract were included in the combination group. After 1:1 propensity score matching, a total of 83 pairs of patients were matched, and differences in relevant indicators between the 2 groups were compared. The total effective rate of treatment in the combination group was 90.36%, which was higher than the control group at 72.29% (P < .05). However, after treatment, the observation group showed higher Mini-Mental State Examination and activities of daily living scores compared to the control group (P < .05). The combined treatment of nimodipine and Ginkgo biloba extract in patients with Parkinson's disease has a significant effect and can effectively improve cognitive function and enhance daily living abilities.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of the effectiveness and safety of ginkgo biloba extract combined with donepezil hydrochloride vs. donepezil for the treatment of vascular dementia (VaD). Methods: Four English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) and four Chinese databases [the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Wanfang DATA, the Chongqing VIP Database (VIP), China Biomedical Database (CBM)] were manually searched for literature published from dates of the inception of the databases to September 2023. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ginkgo biloba extract with donepezil hydrochloride vs. donepezil for the treatment of VaD were included. Relevant literature was screened, and the data in the included studies were extracted for quality assessment according to the Risk of bias tool. Results: A total of 1,309 participants were enrolled in the 15 RCTs. Of these, 656 participants were in the experimental group (ginkgo biloba extract combined with donepezil) and 653 participants were in the control group (donepezil).The results showed that combination therapy was superior to donepezil alone, and there were statistically significant differences in several outcomes including RR in change for total effective rate (1.28, 95% confidence intervals 1.20, 1.38, p < 0.001), MD in change for Mini-Mental State Examination score (2.98, 95%CI 2.31, 3.65, p < 0.001), Barthel Index score (8.55,95%CI 1.11, 15.99, p = 0.024), Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL)score (10.11,95% CI 7.16,13.07,p < 0.001). Conclusion: Ginkgo biloba extract combined with donepezil dramatically improved the total effective rate, MMSE, BI and ADL scores, and decreased homocysteine (HCY), plasma viscosity (PV), whole blood viscosity at high cut (BVH) and whole blood viscosity at low cut (BVL) in VaD patients, while the effect on mean flow velocity and pulse index (PI) of middle cerebral artery (MCA) is not obvious. However, more relevant high-quality RCTs are needed to validate these results. Systematic Review Registration: Identifier CRD42023474678."

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment poses an increasing challenge to middle-aged and elderly populations. Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs like Cistanche tubulosa and Ginkgo biloba (CG) have been proposed as potential agents to improve cognitive and memory functions. A randomized controlled trial involving 100 Chinese middle-aged and elderly participants was conducted to investigate the potential synergistic effects of CG on cognitive function in individuals at risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Over 90 days, both CG group and placebo group received two tablets daily, with each pair of CG tablets containing 72 mg echinacoside and 27 mg flavonol glycosides. Cognitive functions were assessed using multiple scales and blood biomarkers were determined at baseline, Day 45, and Day 90. The CG group exhibited significant improvements in the scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (26.5 at baseline vs. 27.1 at Day 90, p < 0.001), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (23.4 at baseline vs. 25.3 at Day 90, p < 0.001), and World Health Organization Quality of Life (81.6 at baseline vs. 84.2 at Day 90, p < 0.001), all surpassing scores in placebo group. Notably, both the Cognitrax matrix test and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised demonstrated enhanced memory functions, including long-term and delayed memory, after CG intervention. Moreover, cognitive-related blood biomarkers, including total tau, pT181, pS199, pT231, pS396, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, significantly decreased, whereas triiodothyronine and free triiodothyronine significantly increased. No treatment-related adverse events were reported, and routine blood and urine tests remained stable. These findings indicated that CG supplementation could potentially serve as an effective supplementary solution for enhancing cognitive and memory functions.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a stealthy and progressive neurological disorder that is a leading cause of dementia in the global elderly population, imposing a significant burden on both the elderly and society. Currently, the condition is treated with medications that alleviate symptoms. Nonetheless, these drugs may not consistently produce the desired results and can cause serious side effects. Hence, there is a vigorous pursuit of alternative options to enhance the quality of life for patients. Ginkgo biloba (GB), an herb with historical use in traditional medicine, contains bioactive compounds such as terpenoids (Ginkgolides A, B, and C), polyphenols, organic acids, and flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin). These compounds are associated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, making them valuable for cognitive health. A systematic search across three databases using specific keywords-GB in AD and dementia-yielded 1702 documents, leading to the selection of 15 clinical trials for synthesis. In eleven studies, GB extract/EGb 761® was shown to improve cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and functional abilities in both dementia types. In four studies, however, there were no significant differences between the GB-treated and placebo groups. Significant improvements were observed in scores obtained from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Short Cognitive Performance Test (SKT), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). While the majority of synthesized clinical trials show that Ginkgo biloba has promising potential for the treatment of these conditions, more research is needed to determine optimal dosages, effective delivery methods, and appropriate pharmaceutical formulations. Furthermore, a thorough assessment of adverse effects, exploration of long-term use implications, and investigation into potential drug interactions are critical aspects that must be carefully evaluated in future studies."

This study examined whether EGb761 treatment would improve TD symptoms and increase MnSOD activity, particularly in TD patients with specific MnSOD Val-9Ala genotype. METHODS: An EGb761 (240 mg/day) 12-week double-blind clinical trial with 157 TD patients was randomized. The severity of TD was measured by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and plasma MnSOD activity was assayed before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Further, in an expanded sample, we compared MnSOD activity in 159 TD, 227 non-TD and 280 healthy controls, as well as the allele frequencies and genotypes for the MnSOD Ala-9Val polymorphism in 352 TD, 486 non-TD and 1150 healthy controls. RESULTS: EGb761 significantly reduced TD symptoms and increased MnSOD activity in TD patients compared to placebo (both p < 0.01). Moreover, we found an interaction between genotype and treatment response (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in the EGb761 group, patients carrying the Ala allele displayed a significantly lower AIMS total score than patients with the Val/Val genotype. In addition, MnSOD activity was significantly lower at baseline in TD patients compared with healthy controls or non-TD patients. CONCLUSION: EGb761 treatment enhanced low MnSOD activity in TD patients and produced greater improvement in TD symptoms in patients with the Ala allele of the MnSOD Ala-9Val polymorphism.",

The current study aimed to examine the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 (GBE) in the treatment of L-arginine-induced AP and its associated lung injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty rats were randomly assigned into four groups. The normal group received only saline intraperitoneally while the other groups received two intraperitoneal L-arginine injections (250 mg/100 g b.wt) separated by a 1-hour interval to provoke AP. GBE (200 and 400 mg/kg/day, PO) was administered for 2 weeks post-induction of pancreatitis. Sera and pancreatic tissues were isolated. RESULTS: The outcome of the present study revealed that GBE ameliorated the elevated levels of serum amylase, lipase, and pancreatic inflammatory mediators viz., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), mitogen-activated protein kinase P38 (MAPK-P38), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Moreover, GBE restored the pancreatic gene expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and prostatic acid phosphatase-2 (PAP-2). Pancreatic and lung histopathological examinations confirmed the aforementioned parameters. CONCLUSION: GBE interfered with the mechanistic pathway of L-arginine-induced acute pancreatic and its associated lung injury. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, GBE can be used as a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AP through down-regulating TLR-4/MAPK-p38/JNK and MAPK- p38/NF-κB signaling cascades."

      "abstract": "Neurological disorders (NDs) are diseases that seriously affect the health of individuals worldwide, potentially leading to a significant reduction in the quality of life for patients and their families. Herbal medicines have been widely used in the treatment of NDs due to their multi-target and multi-pathway features. Ginkgo biloba leaves (GBLs), one of the most popular herbal medicines in the world, have been demonstrated to present therapeutic effects on NDs. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of GBLs in the treatment of neurological disorders have not been systematically summarized. This study aimed to summarize the molecular mechanism of GBLs in treating NDs from the cell models, animal models, and clinical trials of studies. Four databases, i.e., PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, and Web of Science were searched using the following keywords: \"Ginkgo biloba\", \"Ginkgo biloba extract\", \"Ginkgo biloba leaves\", \"Ginkgo biloba leaves extract\", \"Neurological disorders\", \"Neurological diseases\", and \"Neurodegenerative diseases\". All items meeting the inclusion criteria on the treatment of NDs with GBLs were extracted and summarized. Additionally, PRISMA 2020 was performed to independently evaluate the screening methods. Out of 1385 records in the database, 52 were screened in relation to the function of GBLs in the treatment of NDs; of these 52 records, 39 were preclinical trials and 13 were clinical studies. Analysis of pharmacological studies revealed that GBLs can improve memory, cognition, behavior, and psychopathology of NDs and that the most frequently associated GBLs are depression, followed by Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the clinical studies of depression, AD, and stroke are the most common, and most of the remaining ND data are available from in vitro or in vivo animal studies. Moreover, the possible mechanisms of GBLs in treating NDs are mainly through free radical scavenging, anti-oxidant activity, anti-inflammatory response, mitochondrial protection, neurotransmitter regulation, and antagonism of PAF. This is the first paper to systematically and comprehensively investigate the pharmacological effects and neuroprotective mechanisms of GBLs in the treatment of NDs thus far. All findings contribute to a better understanding of the efficacy and complexity of GBLs in treating NDs, which is of great significance for the further clinical application of this herbal medicine.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of garden waste as a substrate component in the cultivation process of the king oyster mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii), with the goal of enhancing both the yield of P. eryngii and the efficiency of energy use. The percentages of G. biloba leaf powder in the substrate were 10.5% and 21% to replace sawdust or sugarcane bagasse in a typical substrate. A substrate formulation that could completely replace sawdust and sugarcane bagasse was selected by analyzing mycelial growth rate, days of production, fruiting body length, biological efficiency, yield, stipe thickness, pileus diameter and laccase activity. The results showed that Y1 (treatment with 21% G. biloba leaf powder and sugarcane bagasse) had the highest yield (303.1 ± 31.9 g), which was higher than that of CK (control) (259.3 ± 37.4 g). The crude fiber content of the samples grown on substrate Y1 (as 7.43%) was higher than CK (7.37%). In addition, P. eryngii grown on substrate Y1 had the highest laccase activity for the complete colonization of the mycelium. Thus, these findings suggest that G. biloba leaf powder represents a viable and economical supplement for enhancing both the yield and quality of P. eryngii."

      "abstract": "Flavonoids are crucial medicinal active ingredients in Ginkgo biloba L. However, the effect of protein post-translational modifications on flavonoid biosynthesis remains poorly explored. Lysine acetylation, a reversible post-translational modification, plays a crucial role in metabolic regulation. This study aims to investigate the potential role of acetylation in G. biloba flavonoid biosynthesis. Through comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes, metabolomes, proteomes and acetylated proteins in different tissues, a total of 11,788 lysine acetylation sites were identified on 4324 acetylated proteins, including 89 acetylation sites on 23 proteins. Additionally, 128 types of differentially accumulated flavonoids were identified among tissues, and a dataset of differentially expressed genes related to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was constructed. Twelve (CHI, C3H1, ANR, DFR, CCoAOMT1, F3H1, F3H2, CCoAOMT2, C3H2, HCT, F3'5'H and FG2) acetylated proteins that might be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were identified. Specifically, we found that the modification levels of CCoAOMT1 and F3'5'H sites correlated with the catalytic production of homoeriodictyol and dihydromyricetin, respectively. Inhibitors of lysine deacetylase (trichostatin A) impacted total flavonoid content in different tissues and increased flavonoid levels in G. biloba roots. Treatment with trichostatin A revealed that expression levels of GbF3'5'H and GbCCoAOMT1 in stems and leaves aligned with total flavonoid content variations, while in roots, expression levels of GbC3H2 and GbFG2 corresponded to total flavonoid content changes. Collectively, these findings reveal for the first time the important role of acetylation in flavonoid biosynthesis.",

This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic mechanism of L-carnitine (LC) and Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GB) supplementation in ameliorating the adverse effects of hyperlipidemia and hepatosteatosis induced by a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) in an animal model. The study involved 50 rats divided into five groups, including a control group, a group receiving only an HCD, and three groups receiving an HCD along with either LC (300 mg LC/kg bw), GB (100 mg GB/kg bw), or both. After eight weeks, various parameters related to lipid and glucose metabolism, antioxidant capacity, histopathology, immune reactivity, and liver ultrastructure were measured. LC + GB supplementation reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with those in the HCD group. Additionally, treatment with both supplements improved antioxidant ability and reduced lipid peroxidation. The histological examination confirmed that the combination therapy reduced liver steatosis and fibrosis while also improving the appearance of cell organelles in the ultrastructural hepatocytes. Finally, the immunohistochemical analysis indicated that cotreatment with LC + GB upregulated the immune expression of GLP-1 and β-Cat in liver sections that were similar to those of the control animals. Mono-treatment with LC or GB alone substantially but not completely protected the liver tissue, while the combined use of LC and GB may be more effective in treating liver damage caused by high cholesterol than either supplement alone by regulating hepatic oxidative stress and the protein expression of GLP-1 and β-Cat.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ginkgo biloba is a traditional Chinese medicine extracted from the Ginkgophyta and is commonly used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. Clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical benefits of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) preparations for patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP). AIM OF THE STUDY: The efficacy of different GBE preparations in treating UAP may vary, leading to a lack of guidance for physicians when choosing GBE preparations. How to make choices among different GBE preparations is a topic worthy of investigation. In order to clarify the efficacy differences among different GBE preparations, provide a reference for their optimal use conditions, this study was conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included literature from eight databases from inception to November 2023. It included UAP patients, with the control group receiving conventional treatment and the treatment group receiving different GBE preparations in addition to conventional treatment. Angina efficacy, electrocardiogram (ECG) improvement, and frequency of angina were chosen as outcomes. This study employed a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis, and the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve was used for estimating the efficacy ranking. RESULTS: A total of 98 studies involving 9513 patients and 9 interventions were included. Compared with conventional treatment, GBE preparations combined with conventional treatment had better efficacy in angina symptoms and ECG improvement. According to the SUCRA ranking, Shuxuening injection was most effective in improving angina symptoms and reducing the frequency of angina. Among oral GBE preparations, Ginkgo tablets had the best performance in improving angina symptoms and ECG manifestations, and reducing the frequency of angina. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the treatment group and the control group, and all adverse events were mild and self-limiting. Compared with oral preparations, the incidence of adverse events for injections was higher. CONCLUSIONS: GBE preparations may alleviate angina symptoms and myocardial ischemia in the treatment of UAP with favorable safety. Shuxuening injection may be the most effective among all GBE preparations in improving angina symptoms, while Ginkgo tablets may perform best among oral formulations. The optimal use of GBE injection may be for rapidly alleviating angina symptoms and myocardial ischemia in patients with UAP, and oral formulation of GBE may be more suitable for the long-term treatment of patients with milder symptoms.

The main manifestations of AD include cognitive and behavioral disorders, neuropsychiatric symptoms, neuroinflammation, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. However, current drugs for AD once the dementia stage has been reached only treat symptoms and do not delay progression, and the research and development of targeted drugs for AD have reached a bottleneck. Thus, other treatment options are needed. Bioactive ingredients derived from plants are promising therapeutic agents. Specifically, Ginkgo biloba (Gb) extracts exert anti-oxidant, anticancer, neuroplastic, neurotransmitter-modulating, blood fluidity, and anti-inflammatory effects, offering alternative options in the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases. The main chemical components of Gb include flavonoids, terpene lactones, proanthocyanidins, organic acids, polysaccharides, and amino acids. Gb and its extracts have shown remarkable therapeutic effects on various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, with few adverse reactions. Thus, high-quality Gb extracts are a well-established treatment option for AD. In this review, we summarize the insights derived from traditional Chinese medicine, experimental models, and emerging clinical trials on the role of Gb and its chemical components in the treatment of the main clinical manifestations of AD.",

Few effective treatments are currently available for fibrosis in SSc, therefore, demand persists for novel therapies. Although use of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has been reported to improve blood circulation and alleviate liver and lung fibrosis, its effect on skin fibrosis in SSc remains unclear. In this study, the effects and underlying mechanisms of GBE on skin fibrosis in bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse model of SSc was investigated. GBE significantly reduced dermal thickness and protein levels of profibrotic factors in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model. Moreover, GBE inhibited the gene expression of profibrotic factors, such as COL1A1, α-SMA, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), in fibroblasts by suppressing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling. Furthermore, GBE inhibited the transdifferentiation of adipocytes into myofibroblasts. Thus, our findings suggest that GBE is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of SSc."

      "abstract": "Polyprenols (PPs) are compounds with excellent biological activities and are applied in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. However, its strong non-polar nature makes it difficult to separate with many saturated impurities (such as saturated fatty acids) extracted together. Complexation extraction is an effective method for separating saturated and polyunsaturated compounds. In this study, mesoporous silica MCM-41 was modified by imidazole-based ionic liquids (IL) followed by coating these MCM-41-supported IL compounds with silver salt to construct π-complexing adsorbent (AgBF4/IL•MCM-41) to enrich PPs from Ginkgo biloba leaves (GBL) extract. The mesoporous π-complexing sorbent was characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), FTIR, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The effect of the ratio of silver salt to IL•MCM-41 on the adsorption capacity of polyprenols from GBL was compared, and the dosage of AgBF4 was determined to be 1.5 mmol/g IL•MCM-41. Adsorption isotherms and kinetics indicate that the π-complexing adsorbent has excellent PPs adsorption performance (153 mg/g at 30 °C) and a fast adsorption rate (the time to reach adsorption equilibrium is 210 s). The PPs were separated using the fixed bed after treatment for only one cycle with AgBF4/IL•MCM-41, and the content of PPs in the product was increased from 38.54% to 70.2%, with a recovery rate of 86.6%. The π-complexing adsorbent showed excellent reusability for ≥3 adsorption-desorption cycles.",

Melarsoprol (MelB) is currently the only treatment available for this disease. MelB use is limited by its lethal neurotoxicity due to post-treatment reactive encephalopathy. This study sought to assess the potential of Ginkgo biloba (GB), a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, to protect the integrity of the blood brain barrier and ameliorate detrimental inflammatory and oxidative events due to T.b.r in mice treated with MelB. METHODOLOGY: Group one constituted the control; group two was infected with T.b.r; group three was infected with T.b.r and treated with 2.2 mg/kg melarsoprol for 10 days; group four was infected with T.b.r and administered with GB 80 mg/kg for 30 days; group five was given GB 80mg/kg for two weeks before infection with T.b.r, and continued thereafter and group six was infected with T.b.r, administered with GB and treated with MelB. RESULTS: Co-administration of MelB and GB improved the survival rate of infected mice. When administered separately, MelB and GB protected the integrity of the blood brain barrier and improved neurological function in infected mice. Furthermore, the administration of MelB and GB prevented T.b.r-induced microcytic hypochromic anaemia and thrombocytopenia, as well as T.b.r-driven downregulation of total WBCs. Glutathione analysis showed that co-administration of MelB and GB prevented T.b.r-induced oxidative stress in the brain, spleen, heart and lungs. Notably, GB averted peroxidation and oxidant damage by ameliorating T.b.r and MelB-driven elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the brain, kidney and liver. In fact, the co-administered group for the liver, registered the lowest MDA levels for infected mice. T.b.r-driven elevation of serum TNF-α, IFN-γ, uric acid and urea was abrogated by MelB and GB. Co-administration of MelB and GB was most effective in stabilizing TNFα levels. GB attenuated T.b.r and MelB-driven up-regulation of nitrite. CONCLUSION: Utilization of GB as an adjuvant therapy may ameliorate detrimental effects caused by T.b.r infection and MelB toxicity during late stage HAT.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bacillus, as a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria, can enhance the resistance of plants to phytopathogens. In our study, Bacillus strains showing excellent biocontrol were screened and used to control ginkgo leaf blight (Alternaria tenuissima). RESULTS: Four biocontrol Bacillus strains-Bsa537, Bam337, Bso544, and Bsu503-were selected from 286 isolates based on their capacity to inhibit pathogens and promote plant growth. The four Bacillus strains significantly improved the resistance of ginkgo to leaf blight. This was especially the case when the four strains were used as a mixture, which contributed to a decrease in lesion area of >40%. Hence, a mixture of Bacillus strains was used to control ginkgo leaf blight in the field. Treatment efficiency varied from 30% to 100% (average 81.5%) and was higher than that of the control (-2% to -18%, average - 8.5%); the antioxidant capacity of the treated ginkgo was also stronger. In addition, ginkgo biomass increased as a result of treatment with the Bacillus mixture, including leaf weight, area, thickness, number of lateral roots and root weight. Furthermore, the Bacillus mixture improved the ginkgo rhizosphere soil by boosting the number of beneficial microorganisms, lowering the number of pathogens and hastening soil catabolism. CONCLUSION: The Bacillus mixture improved the health status of ginkgo by protecting it from pathogen attack, promoting its growth and improving the microorganism community in the rhizosphere.

There were three treatments, with low (50 mmol·L-1), medium (100 mmol·L-1), and high (200 mmol·L-1) NaCl stress. Leaves were sprayed and the soil was watered with melatonin solution (0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5 mmol·L-1). The results showed that saline stress significantly inhibited the osmoregulation and antioxidant capacities of G. biloba seedlings. Application of exogenous melatonin at appropriate concentrations (0.02, 0.1 mmol·L-1) under salt stress could promote plant growth, reduce the rate of electrolyte leakage, decrease the content of flavonoids and malonic dialdehyde, and enhance peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in leaves. High concentration (0.5 mmol·L-1) of exogenous melatonin would aggravate the oxidative and osmotic stresses. The 0.02 and 0.1 mmol·L-1 exogenous melatonin alleviated osmotic stress and oxidative stress in G. biloba seedlings under salt stress, while the 0.02 mmol·L-1 exogenous melatonin treatment had the best effect on NaCl stress alleviation. Ground diameter, branch width, branch length, electrolyte leakage rate, superoxide dismutase activity, and flavonoids content could be used as the key indices for rapid identification of the degree of salt stress in G. biloba seedlings.",

DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the methodological quality, risk of bias (ROB), reporting quality, and credibility of evidence of the included SRs and MAs using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS), the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA), and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), respectively. Additionally, descriptive analysis and data synthesis were conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-nine SRs/MAs involving 119 outcomes were included in this review. The overall methodological quality of all SRs/MAs was critically low based on AMSTAR 2, and 28 had a high ROB based on the ROBIS. According to the PRISMA statement, the reporting items of the included SRs/MAs are relatively complete. The results based on GRADE showed that of the 119 outcomes, 8 were rated as moderate quality, 24 as low quality, and 87 as very low quality. Based on the data synthesis, GBLPs used in conjunction with conventional treatment were superior to conventional treatment alone for decreasing neurological function scores. CONCLUSION: GBLPs can be considered a beneficial supplemental therapy for IS. However, because of the low quality of the existing evidence, high-quality RCTs and SRs/MAs are warranted to further evaluate the benefits of GBLPs for treating IS.

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: As reported in the Ancient Chinese Medicinal Books, Ginkgo biloba L. fruit has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment asthma and cough or as a disinfectant. Our previous study demonstrated that G. biloba exocarp extract (GBEE), an extract of a traditional Chinese herb, inhibits the formation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms. However, GBEE is a crude extract that contains many components, and the underlying mechanisms of purified GBEE fractions extracted with solvents of different polarities are unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the different components in GBEE fractions extracted with solvents of different polarities and their antibacterial effects and mechanisms against MRSA and Staphylococcus haemolyticus biofilms both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The components in different fractions were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). Microbroth dilution assays and time growth curves were used to determine the antibacterial effects of the fractions on 15 clinical bacterial isolates. Crystal violet staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to identify the fractions that affected bacterial biofilm formation. The potential MRSA targets of the GBEE fraction obtained with petroleum ether (PE), denoted GBEE-PE, were screened by transcriptome sequencing, and the gene expression profile was verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: HPLC-HRMS analysis revealed that the four GBEE fractions (extracted with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water) contained different ginkgo components, and the antibacterial effects decreased as the polarity of the extraction solvent increased. The antibacterial activity of GBEE-PE was greater than that of the GBEE fraction extracted with ethyl acetate (EA). GBEE-PE improved H. illucens survival and reduced MRSA colonization in model mouse organs. Crystal violet staining and SEM and TEM analyses revealed that GBEE-PE inhibited MRSA and S. haemolyticus biofilm formation. Transcriptional analysis revealed that GBEE-PE inhibits MRSA biofilms by altering ion transport, cell wall metabolism and virulence-related gene expression. In addition, the LO2 cell viability and H. illucens toxicity assay data showed that GBEE-PE at 20 mg/kg was nontoxic. CONCLUSION: The GBEE fractions contained different components, and their antibacterial effects decreased with increases in the polarity of the extraction solvent. GBEE-PE limited MRSA growth and biofilm formation by affecting ion transport, cell wall synthesis, and virulence-related pathways. This research provides a more detailed overview of the mechanism by which GBEE-PE inhibits MRSA both in vitro and in vivo and suggests that GBEE-PE is a new prospective antimicrobial with the potential to be used in MRSA therapeutics in the future.",

Chronic exposure to arsenic may lead to arsenicosis, while no specific therapeutic strategies are available for the arsenism patients. And Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) exhibited protective effect in our previous study. However, the mechanisms by which GBE protects the arsenism patients remain poorly understood. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based untargeted metabolomics analysis was used to study metabolic response in arsenism patients upon GBE intervention. In total, 39 coal-burning type of arsenism patients and 50 healthy residents were enrolled from Guizhou province of China. The intervention group (n = 39) were arsenism patients orally administered with GBE (three times per day) for continuous 90 days. Plasma samples from 50 healthy controls (HC) and 39 arsenism patients before and after GBE intervention were collected and analyzed by established LC-MS method. Statistical analysis was performed by MetaboAnalyst 5.0 to identify differential metabolites. Multivariate analysis revealed a separation in arsenism patients between before (BG) and after GBE intervention (AG) group. It was observed that 35 differential metabolites were identified between BG and AG group, and 30 of them were completely or partially reversed by GBE intervention, with 14 differential metabolites significantly up-regulated and 16 differential metabolites considerably down-regulated. These metabolites were involved in promoting immune response and anti-inflammatory functions, and alleviating oxidative stress. Taken together, these findings indicate that the GBE intervention could probably exert its protective effects by reversing disordered metabolites modulating these functions in arsenism patients, and provide insights into further exploration of mechanistic studies.",

METHODS: Relevant RCTs on GBE as adjuvant therapy for ICH were searched in seven Chinese and English databases. Data extraction of the included literature was performed after duplicate checking and screening, and Stata 15.1 software was applied for data analysis. RESULTS: With a total of 19 RCTs, the meta-analysis results showed that: Compared with conventional treatment alone, GBE combined with conventional treatment had a higher effective rate; NIHSS score and CSS score were lower; The residual hematoma was less. The volume of cerebral edema was smaller. ADL score was higher. MoCA score was higher. The serum levels of hs-CRP, TNF-α and IL-6 were lower; No significant difference was observed in the incidence of adverse reactions between conventional treatment alone and GBE combined with conventional treatment. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that GBE as adjuvant therapy for ICH has better efficacy and is relatively safe compared with conventional treatment alone. However, due to the quality and quantity of included studies, further validation by more methodologically rigorous and multi-center studies with larger sample sizes is needed."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stable angina pectoris (SAP) is a clinical condition characterized by reversible and temporary myocardial ischemia and hypoxia. A majority of SAP patients also experience depressive disorders, which adversely affect their disease prognosis and overall quality of life. However, the clinical utility of existing antidepressants is constrained by their side effects. Ginkgo biloba dropping pill (GBDP), a Chinese patented medication, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of both coronary heart disease and mental disorders. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of GBDP as an adjuvant therapy for SAP complicated by depression. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either GBDP or a placebo (5 pills, three times a day) in addition to standard therapy for a duration of 12 weeks. The Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) was administered every 4 weeks during the treatment, and angina event frequency was assessed weekly. The 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores were measured both before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Out of the 72 patients, 68 (n = 34 per group) completed the entire study. At the first visit (4 weeks ± 3 days), the SAQ-Angina Stability score in the GBDP group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (p < 0.05). While the average weekly frequency of angina episodes in the placebo group notably increased after 12 weeks of treatment (p < 0.05), it displayed an improving trend in the GBDP group (p > 0.05). By the endpoint, each subcategory score of SF-36 in the GBDP group exhibited significant improvement compared to baseline (p < 0.05). The comparison of score improvement between the two groups revealed that the SF-PCS score of the GBDP group was higher than that of the placebo group (p < 0.05). HAMD scores in both groups significantly increased after treatment (p < 0.05). No discernible difference in the incidence of adverse reactions was observed between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with SAP complicated by depression, GBDP, when combined with standard treatment, rapidly and safely alleviates angina pectoris symptoms. It demonstrates therapeutic potential in enhancing the quality of life and alleviating depressive symptoms.",

However, the mechanism of Ginkgo biloba leaves in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. METHODS: The active components and corresponding targets of Ginkgo biloba leaves were obtained from the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP) database, and the targets of NSCLC were obtained from the GeneCards, OMIM, TTD, and DrugBank databases. The common targets of NSCLC and Ginkgo biloba leaves were obtained from VENNY 2.1.0. The STRING database was utilized to construct protein-protein intersections, by using the Cytoscape 3.7.1 software, the protein-protein intersection was optimized and the drug-disease network diagram was constructed. The DAVID database was utilized to perform GO and KEGG analysis. Finally, The Autodock Vina software was used to perform molecular docking of core components and targets. RESULTS: The key components of Ginkgo biloba leaves in treating NSCLC include quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol, which may act on Tp53, AKT1, and TNF. Bioinformatic annotation analysis results suggest that Ginkgo biloba leaves may implicated in PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. The molecular docking results show the firm affinity between key ingredients and targets. CONCLUSION: The potential mechanism of Ginkgo biloba leaves in treating NSCLC has been discussed in this study, which provides a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of NSCLC and further experimental validation.",

      "abstract": "Acute liver injury (ALI) is a global health problem associated with high mortality and has attracted clinical attention. Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) is an extract from dried Ginkgo leaves that has many pharmacological effects because of its various ingredients and has been shown to be hepatoprotective. We investigated the hepatoprotective effect of GBE on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury in vitro. The components of Ginkgo biloba extract are analyzed by LC-MS, and the key targets of \"liver injury-Ginkgo biloba\" are identified based on bioinformatics analysis. The signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT are mainly enriched with high correlation in KEGG. The results of in vitro experiments showed that compared with the Model group, except that the ALT activity level and MDA content in EGB-L group were not significantly decreased (P > 0.05), the activity of ALT, AST and MDA content in other EGB groups were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and the activities of SOD and CAT were significantly increased (P < 0.05). The expression of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were also detected. The results showed that compared with the Model group, the contents of IL-6 in EGB-L group were not significantly decreased (P > 0.05), while the contents of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in other EGB groups were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), indicating that EGB could reduce the level of cell inflammation. Western blot assay detected the protein expression levels of GF, RTK, PI3K, AKT and p-AKT in cells. The results showed that compared with the Model group, the protein expression levels of GF, RTK, PI3K, AKT and P-AKT were significantly increased after EGB treatment (P < 0.05), and the protein expression level of the EGB-H group was higher than the EGB-L group. Ginkgo biloba extract can inhibit the expression of downstream related genes by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and at the same time alleviate the inflammatory response of cells, reduce the level of inflammation, and protect the cell damage caused by CCl4."

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment, depression and (mental) fatigue represent the most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms of the post-COVID syndrome. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified as common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms. Attempts to treat post-COVID-associated cognitive impairment and fatigue with different drugs available for other diseases have not yet been successful. One probable explanation could be that these drugs work by one specific mechanism of action only and not in a broad multi-target way. Therefore, they will not address the broad pathophysiological spectrum possibly responsible for cognitive impairment, depression and fatigue in post-COVID syndrome. Notably, nearly all drugs currently under investigation for fatigue in post-COVID syndrome are rather addressing one single target instead of the several pathomechanisms underlying this condition. Contrary to this approach, herbal drugs often consist of many different ingredients with different pharmacological properties and pharmacological targets. Therefore, these drugs might be a promising approach for the treatment of the broad symptomatic presentation and the pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment and fatigue following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these herbal drugs, extracts of Ginkgo biloba and Rhodiola rosea probably are the best investigated candidates. Their broad pharmacological spectrum in vitro and in vivo includes anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant as well as properties reducing cognitive impairment and fatigue. In several studies, both drugs showed positive effects on physical and mental fatigue and impaired cognition. Moreover, depressive symptoms were also reduced in some studies. However, even if these results are promising, the data are still preliminary and require additional proof by further studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the most unique plants that have ever grown on the planet is Ginkgo biloba L., a member of the Ginkgoaceae family with no close living relatives. The existence of several differently structured components of G. biloba has increased the chemical variety of herbal therapy. Numerous studies that investigated the biochemical characteristics of G. biloba suggest this plant as a potential treatment for many illnesses. PURPOSE: Review the molecular mechanisms involved in the signaling pathways of G. biloba activity in varied circumstances and its potential as a novel treatment for various illnesses. METHODS: Studies focusing on the molecular processes and signaling pathways of compounds and extracts of G. biloba were found and summarized using the proper keywords and operators from Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus without time restrictions. RESULTS: G. biloba exerts its effects through its anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-cancer, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antibacterial, pulmoprotective, renoprotective, anti-osteoporosis, anti-melanogenic, retinoprotective, otoprotective, adipogenic, and anti-adipogenic properties. The most important mechanisms involved in these actions are altering the elevation of ROS formation, inhibiting NADPH oxidases activation, altering the expression of antioxidant enzymes, downregulating MAPKs (p38 MAPK and ERK, and JNK) and AP-1, increasing cAMP, inactivating Stat5, activating the AMPK signaling pathway, affecting Stat3/JAK2, NF-κB, Nrf-2, mTOR, HGF/c-Met, Wnt/β-catenin and BMP signaling pathways, and changing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the release of Cyc from mitochondria to cytosol, the protein cleavage of caspases 3, 7, 8, 9, and 12, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and MMPs levels. CONCLUSIONS: G. biloba and its components have gained attention in recent years for their therapeutic benefits, such as their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and apoptotic effects. By understanding their molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways, potential novel medicines might be developed in response to the rising public desire for new therapies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major contributor to cancer-related deaths worldwide, driving the need for effective anticancer therapies with fewer side effects. The exploration of Ginkgo biloba, a natural source, offers a hopeful avenue for novel treatments targeting key colorectal biomarkers involved in CRC treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the binding affinity of natural molecules derived from G. biloba to essential biomarkers associated with CRC, including Kirsten rat sarcoma virus, neuroblastoma RAS mutations, serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, and deleted colorectal cancer, using molecular docking. The focus of this research was to evaluate how effectively these molecules bind to specified targets in order to identify potential inhibitors for the treatment of CRC. METHODS: A total of 152 polyphenolic compounds from G. biloba were selected and subjected to molecular docking simulations to evaluate their interactions with CRC-related biomarkers. The docking results were analysed to identify ligands exhibiting strong affinities towards the targeted genes, suggesting potential inhibitory effects. RESULTS: Docking simulations unveiled the strong binding affinities between selected polyphenolic compounds derived from G. biloba and genes associated with CRC. The complex glycoside structures that are found in flavonols are of significant importance. These compounds, including derivatives with distinctive arrangements, exhibited promising docking scores, signifying substantial interactions with the targeted biomarkers. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the potential of G. biloba-derived molecules as effective anticancer agents for colorectal cancer. The identified ligands exhibit strong interactions with crucial CRC-related biomarkers, suggesting potential inhibition ability. Further in vitro and in vivo investigations are needed to validate and build upon these promising findings, advancing the development of novel and efficient CRC therapies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is a major reason for chemotherapy delays, dose reduction, or even treatment discontinuation, which may impact oncologic outcomes. We investigated the effects of quercetin and extracts of Phyllanthus emblica fruit (PEE), Morus alba leaf (MAE), and Ginkgo biloba leaf (GBE) on platelet recovery in a rat model of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. METHODS: The total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), quercetin content, and antioxidant activities of all the extracts were determined. Sixty male Sprague Dawley rats were categorized into healthy controls and CIT groups. The CIT groups was administered a cyclophosphamide solution, while the control group received a saline solution. Each group was then subdivided into five subgroups of six animals which were administered with PEE, MAE, GBE, quercetin, or a vehicle for 15 days. RESULTS: The highest quercetin content was found in PEE, followed by MAE and GBE, which correlated with their antioxidant properties. Administration of these extracts and quercetin did not significantly change the platelet counts in healthy rats. Thrombocytopenic rats treated with PEE, MAE, and GBE also were not associated with significant changes in platelet counts. However, more rapid platelet count recovery was observed in all groups receiving extracts. On day 11, platelet counts in the PEE, MAE, and GBE groups returned to near baseline levels with a mean of 4.29 %, -40.77 %, and -14.24 %, respectively, compared to -71 % in the CIT group. In thrombocytopenic rats treated with quercetin, there was a significant increase in platelet counts on days 9 and 11, with a mean decrease of 5.41 % from baseline on day 11. CONCLUSION: Quercetin improved platelet recovery in the animal model of CIT. This finding merits for further investigation to better elucidate the health benefits of quercetin and quercetin-rich plants and potential pharmacokinetics underpinning their activity in thrombocytopenia."

      "abstract": "Extracellular senile plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles are two devastating brain proteinopathies that are indicative of Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent type of dementia. Currently, no effective medications are available to stop or reverse Alzheimer's disease. Ginkgo biloba extract, commonly referred to as EGb 761, is a natural product made from the leaves of the G. biloba tree. It has long been demonstrated to have therapeutic benefits in Alzheimer's disease. The current study assessed the beneficial effects of EGb 761 against Alzheimer's disease in comparison with memantine, a standard treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The scopolamine-heavy metals mixture rat Alzheimer's disease model is a newly created model to study the effects of EGb 761 oral therapy on cognitive performance and other Alzheimer's disease-like changes over a 28-day experimental period. This new Alzheimer's disease model provides better criteria for Alzheimer's disease hallmarks than the conventional scopolamine model. The EGb 761 reversed memory and learning deficits induced by the scopolamine-heavy metals mixture. These outcomes were linked to a more pronounced inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase, caspase-3, hippocampal amyloid-beta protein (Aβ1 - 42), phosphorylated tau protein counts, and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) compared to the memantine-treated group. Furthermore, EGb 761 treatment considerably reduced lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and improved reduced glutathione levels compared to memantine. Our results suggest EGb 761's potential in treating central nervous system disorders. It's a promising candidate for future Alzheimer's disease therapeutic exploration. This study also highlights the need for future research to focus on the positive benefits of herbal medicines.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that medications that regulate the \"brain-gut\" axis can ameliorate disease symptoms of AD. Studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) is involved in intestinal metabolism to meet the goal of illness treatment. EGb is currently utilized extensively in the clinical prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, the regulatory effect of EGb on intestinal flora and its metabolites in AD pathology remains largely speculative. In this study, the Morris water maze test showed a significant improvement of spatial memory in the AD mouse model (APP/PS1 mice) after EGb treatment. We next confirmed the positive effects of EGb on the gut flora and metabolites of APP/PS1 mice and further showed that EGb treatment reshaped the disturbed gut microbiome, in particular by reducing the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio and increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Uroviricota, Streptophyta, and Spirochaetes. Meanwhile, a non-targeted metabolomics analysis showed that EGb treatment significantly reversed the dysfunction of the microbial metabolic phenotype by altering Limosilactobacillus and Parvibacte, with 300 differential metabolites modulated (131 up-regulated, 169 down-regulated). Our findings highlight the significant regulatory impact of EGb on intestinal microflora and microbial metabolism in AD mice models and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for AD."

      "abstract": "Ginkgo biloba (GB) extracts have been used in clinical studies as an alternative therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the exact bioaction mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this work, an in silico study on GB metabolites was carried out using SwissTargetPrediction to determine the proteins associated with AD. The resulting proteins, AChE, MAO-A, MAO-B, β-secretase and γ-secretase, were studied by molecular docking, resulting in the finding that kaempferol, quercetin, and luteolin have multitarget potential against AD. These compounds also exhibit antioxidant activity towards reactive oxygen species (ROS), so antioxidant tests were performed on the extracts using the DPPH and ABTS techniques. The ethanol and ethyl acetate GB extracts showed an important inhibition percentage, higher than 80%, at a dose of 0.01 mg/mL. The effect of GB extracts on AD resulted in multitarget action through two pathways: firstly, inhibiting enzymes responsible for degrading neurotransmitters and forming amyloid plaques; secondly, decreasing ROS in the central nervous system (CNS), reducing its deterioration, and promoting the formation of amyloid plaques. The results of this work demonstrate the great potential of GB as a medicinal plant."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is one of the most common movement disorders in approximately 20 - 35% of patients on antipsychotic medications. Managing the symptoms of DIP is challenging due to the limited number of potentially effective medications. On the other hand, this restricted possible treatment could have numerous side effects that ultimately result in patients stopping the medication all at once. The neuroprotective property of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) emerged as an effective commodity for the additional treatment of psychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of EGb in psychiatric patients with symptoms of DIP. METHODS: A sample of 63 patients who met the inclusion criteria were recruited and randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Both groups were followed for 3 months. One group received 80 mg of G. biloba three times a day, and the control group received a placebo. The patients were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. RESULTS: Ginkgo could change the intensity of rest tremors, the severity of motor symptoms, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Ginkgo biloba might alleviate the severity of parkinsonism and motor symptoms and could lead to changes in the two components of working memory and short-term memory. CONCLUSIONS: Ginkgo biloba extract can be used as an effective and safe treatment in the management of DIP, whether in patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders or mood disorders."

      "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that long-term arsenic exposure can induce liver injury. Our previous studies have demonstrated that liver injury occurs in arsenic-poisoning patients and arsenic-exposed rats. However, therapeutic targets are still unclear, and there is a lack of effective drugs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of sodium arsenite (arsenite) exposure on hepatocyte senescence and the intervention effect of ginkgo biloba extract in rats. In this study, 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 180-200 g) were randomized into three groups. The control group received a normal diet, and the arsenic-exposed group was given 10 mg/L arsenite for 3 months by free drinking along with a normal diet. The ginkgo biloba extract treatment group was consecutively administered EGb761 (10 mg/kg, by gavage) for 1 month following 2 months of arsenite exposure. Our results showed that exposure to 10 mg/L arsenite induced narrowing of the hepatic sinus space, enlargement of hepatocytes, and increased multinucleated hepatocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration in rat liver tissue compared with the normal control group. Moreover, 10 mg/L arsenite also caused abnormal expression of inflammation-related indices (IL1-β, IL-6, TNF-α), oxidative damage-related indices (SOD, MDA, GPx), and senescence-related proteins (p16, p-p53, E2F1). EGb761 could effectively reduce the pathological damage of liver tissue and antagonize the abnormal expression of liver tissue inflammation and oxidative damage-related indices as well as cellular senescence-related proteins caused by arsenite exposure. Notably, EGb761 reduced the accumulation of arsenic in rat liver tissues. These results suggested that EGb761 could effectively alleviate subchronic arsenic exposure-induced senescence of hepatocytes, which may be achieved partially through inhibiting inflammation and oxidative damage in rats. This study may provide a new therapeutic target for arsenic-induced liver injury.",

As part of our ongoing discovery of novel bioactive components from natural sources, we directed our focus toward the investigation of potential bioactive compounds from G. biloba fruit. The profiles of its chemical compounds were examined using a Global Natural Products Social (GNPS)-based molecular networking analysis. Guided by this, we successfully isolated and characterized 11 compounds from G. biloba fruit, including (E)-coniferin (1), syringin (2), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (3), vanillic acid 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (4), syringic acid 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (5), (E)-ferulic acid 4-O-β-D-glucoside (6), (E)-sinapic acid 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (7), (1'R,2'S,5'R,8'S,2'Z,4'E)-dihydrophaseic acid 3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (8), eucomic acid (9), rutin (10), and laricitrin 3-rutinoside (11). The structural identification was validated through a comprehensive analysis involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic data and LC/MS analyses. All isolated compounds were evaluated using an E-screen assay for their estrogen-like effects in MCF-7 cells. As a result, compounds 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9 promoted cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells, and these effects were mitigated by the ER antagonist, ICI 182,780. In particular, cell proliferation increased most significantly to 140.9 ± 6.5% after treatment with 100 µM of compound 2. The mechanism underlying the estrogen-like effect of syringin (2) was evaluated using a Western blot analysis to determine the expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα). We found that syringin (2) induced an increase in the phosphorylation of ERα. Overall, these experimental results suggest that syringin (2) can potentially aid the control of estrogenic activity during menopause."

      "abstract": "Nitrate is a primary nitrogen source for plant growth, and previous studies have indicated a correlation between nitrogen and browning. Nitrate transporters (NRTs) are crucial in nitrate allocation. Here, we utilized a genome-wide approach to identify and analyze the expression pattern of 74 potential GbNRTs under nitrate treatments during calluses browning in Ginkgo, including 68 NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1 (NRT1)/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER (PTR) (NPF), 4 NRT2 and 2 NRT3. Conserved domains, motifs, phylogeny, and cis-acting elements (CREs) were analyzed to demonstrate the evolutionary conservation and functional diversity of GbNRTs. Our analysis showed that the NPF family was divided into eight branches, with the GbNPF2 and GbNPF6 subfamilies split into three groups. Each GbNRT contained 108-214 CREs of 19-36 types, especially with binding sites of auxin and transcription factors v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH). The E1X1X2E2R motif had significant variations in GbNPFs, indicating changes in the potential dynamic proton transporting ability. The expression profiles of GbNRTs indicated that they may function in regulating nitrate uptake and modulating the signaling of auxin and polyphenols biosynthesis, thereby affecting browning in Ginkgo callus induction. These findings provide a better understanding of the role of NRTs during NO3- uptake and utilization in vitro culture, which is crucial to prevent browning and develop an efficient regeneration and suspension production system in Ginkgo.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to use modeling methods to estimate the antiviral activity of natural molecules extracted from Ginkgo biloba for the treatment of variola which is a zoonotic disease posing a growing threat to human survival. The recent spread of variola in nonendemic countries and the possibility of its use as a bioterrorism weapon have made it a global threat once again. Therefore, the search for new antiviral therapies with reduced side effects is necessary. METHODS: In this study, we examined the interactions between polyphenolic compounds from Ginkgo biloba, a plant known for its antiviral activity, and two enzymes involved in variola treatment, VarTMPK and HssTMPK, using molecular docking. RESULTS: The obtained docking scores showed that among the 152 selected polyphenolic compounds; many ligands had high inhibitory potential according to the energy affinity. By considering Lipinski's rules, we found that Liquiritin and Olivil molecules are the best candidates to be developed into drugs that inhibit VarTMPK because of their high obtained scores compared to reference ligands, and zero violations of Lipinski's rules. We also found that ginkgolic acids have good affinities with HssTMPK and acceptable physicochemical properties to be developed into drugs administered orally. CONCLUSION: Based on the obtained scores and Lipinski's rules, Liquiritin, Olivil, and ginkgolic acids molecules showed interesting results for both studied enzymes, indicating the existence of promising and moderate activity of these polyphenols for the treatment of variola and for possible multi-targeting. Liquiritin has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects on various inflammation- related diseases such as skin injury, hepatic inflammatory injury, and rheumatoid arthritis. Olivil has been shown to have antioxidant activity. Olivil derivatives have also been studied for their potential use as anticancer agents. Ginkgolic acids have been shown to have antimicrobial and antifungal properties. However, ginkgolic acids are also known to cause allergic reactions in some people. Therefore, future studies should consider these results and explore the potential of these compounds as antiviral agents. Further experimental studies in-vitro and in-vivo are required to validate and scale up these findings.",

A standardized Ginkgo biloba (EGb-761) has demonstrated potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which is beneficial for the treatment of diseases that exhibit oxidative stress and inflammation. The present study sought to investigate the putative ameliorative effects of EGb-761 against SMB-induced toxicity in mice. Thirty-two male Swiss white mice were randomized into control, SMB-treated, SMB + EGb-761-treated, and EGb-761-treated groups. EGb-761 (100 mg/kg/day) and SMB (98 mg/kg/day) were administered by gastric gavage for 40 days. Oral administration of EGb-761 restored SMB-induced decrease in body weight and prevented SMB-induced thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and anemia. Furthermore, EGb-761-treatment protected against SMB-induced liver and kidney injury depicted by decreased serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine, urea, uric acid, and albumin. Furthermore, EGb-761 treatment attenuated SMB-driven dyslipidemia and metabolic acidosis. Besides, EGb-761 supplementation abrogated SMB-driven oxidative stress as depicted by stabilized reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the brain, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, and lungs. SMB induced a significant increase of tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), serum nitric oxide (NO), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) which were abrogated by EGb-761 treatment. In conclusion, these results deepen our understanding of EGb-761 in light of various detrimental effects of SMB-driven toxicities. These findings provide a novel approach that can be optimized for preventing or treating exposure due to SMB toxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba leaves (GBLs), as an herbal dietary supplement and a traditional Chinese medicine, have been used in treating diseases for hundred years. Recently, increasing evidence reveals that the extracts and active ingredients of GBLs have anti-cancer (chemo-preventive) properties. However, the molecular mechanism of GBLs in anti-cancer has not been comprehensively summarized. PURPOSE: To systematically summarize the literatures for identifying the molecular mechanism of GBLs in cellular, animal models and clinical trials of cancers, as well as for critically evaluating the current evidence of efficacy and safety of GBLs for cancers. METHODS: Employing the search terms \"Ginkgo biloba\" and \"cancer\" till July 25, 2023, a comprehensive search was carried out in four electronic databases including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science. The articles not contained in the databases are performed by manual searches and all the literatures on anti-cancer research and mechanism of action of GBLs was extracted and summarized. The quality of methodology was assessed independently through PRISMA 2020. RESULTS: Among 84 records found in the database, 28 were systematic reviews related to GBLs, while the remaining 56 records were related to the anticancer effects of GBLs, which include studies on the anticancer activities and mechanisms of extracts or its components in GBLs at cellular, animal, and clinical levels. During these studies, the top six cancer types associated with GBLs are lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and cervical cancer. Further analysis reveals that GBLs primarily exert their anticancer effects by stimulating cancer cell apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion and migration of cancers, exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and modulating signaling pathways. Besides, the pharmacology, toxicology, and clinical research on the anti-tumor activity of GBLs have also been discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first paper to thoroughly investigate the pharmacology effect, toxicology, and the mechanisms of action of GBLs for anti-cancer properties. All the findings will reinforce the need to explore the new usage of GBLs in cancers and offer comprehensive reference data and recommendations for future research on this herbal medicine.",

METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomly assigned to the Aspirin group (24 cases in Controlled group) and the Aspirin + Ginkgo biloba group (25 cases in Treatment group). The quantitative magnetic sensitivity and venous oxygen saturation of cerebral microbleeds were analyzed at admission, discharge, and after follow-up for 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: The demographic details age, gender, and admission to NIHSS were not significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05). Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) showed that the magnetic sensitivity of patients in both groups remained stable after 3 and 6 months of follow-up, while the venous oxygen saturation of the Treatment group increased. The venous oxygen saturation at 3 and 6 months of follow-up was negatively correlated with the modified mRS grade score. CONCLUSIONS: QSM can be used as a quantitative follow-up tool in monitoring both oxygen saturation and Magnetic susceptibility of microbleeds noninvasively in ischemic stroke patients with cerebral microbleeds. EGB combined with Aspirin can improve blood oxygen saturation in those patients and this effect is particularly significant in the long-term efficacy of secondary prevention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic gastrointestinal dysfunction (DGD) is a common complication in diabetic patients, and enteric glial cells (EGCs) found in the gastrointestinal tract have been shown to play an essential role in gastrointestinal dysfunction. Thus, targeting EGCs may be helpful for the control of DGD. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) from G. biloba dropping pills against hyperglycaemic stress-induced EGCs injury and its underlying mechanism. METHODS: In vitro, the protective effect of GBE on CRL-2690 cells was evaluated by MTT assay and TUNEL assay. The expression of related markers was evaluated by RNA sequencing and validated by using western blotting. In vivo, STZ-induced C57BL/6J WT mice were used as models to evaluate the effects of GBE on blood glucose, body weight, and EGCs' activity and relevant signalling pathways were validated by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The results showed that GBE (25 μg/ml) treatment significantly attenuated hyperglycaemic stress-induced cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis in CRL-2690 cells, which was verified in an STZ-induced (100 mg/kg, 3 days) diabetic mouse model with continuous GBE administration (25/100 mg/kg/day, 6/12 weeks). Further mechanistic study based on transcriptomic data revealed that GBE exerted its beneficial effect by regulating immune-related pathways, and TLR2/BTK/NF-κB/IL-1α/IL-10 comprised the main targets of this drug. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the protective effect of GBE against hyperglycaemic stress-induced EGCs injury using both in vitro and in vivo models and further reveals that the effect was achieved by targeting TLR2 and its downstream molecules BTK/NF-κB/IL-1α/IL-10. This study may be helpful for expanding the clinical application of GBE in treating DGD.",

Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) was used to regulate various neurological disorders; however, the impact of EGb on ischemic stroke is still unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate whether immunomodulation has participated in the beneficial effects of EGb on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury. Mice were orally administered with EGb once daily for 7 days before the induction of I/R. Neurobehavioral scores, infarct volume, and brain inflammation were determined. The proportion of CD4+ T cells was detected by flow cytometry. EGb significantly lowered neurobehavioral scores, infarct volume, and the level of inflammatory cytokines in I/R mice. Interestingly, EGb altered the proportion of CD4+ T cells, particularly increasing the proportion of Treg cells. Depletion of Treg cells weakened the neuroprotective effects of EGb on ischemic stroke; furthermore, EGb decreased the expression of HIF-1α and HK2 and promoted the differentiation of Treg cells in vitro. EGb suppressed the HIF-1α/HK2 signaling pathway to promote the differentiation of Treg cells and ameliorate ischemic stroke in mice. The expansion effect of EGb on Treg cells could be exploited as part of future stroke therapy.",

      "abstract": "Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb-761) is well-recognized to have neuroprotective properties. Meanwhile, autophagy machinery is extensively involved in the pathophysiological processes of ischemic stroke. The EGb-761 is widely used in the clinical treatment of stroke patients. However, its neuroprotective mechanisms against ischemic stroke are still not fully understood. The present study was conducted to uncover whether the pharmacological effects of EGb-761 can be executed by modulation of the autophagic/lysosomal signaling axis. A Sprague-Dawley rat model of ischemic stroke was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min, followed by reperfusion. The EGb-761 was then administered to the MCAO rats once daily for a total of 7 days. Thereafter, the penumbral tissues were acquired to detect proteins involved in the autophagic/lysosomal pathway including Beclin1, LC-3, SQSTM1/p62, ubiquitin, cathepsin B, and cathepsin D by western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. Subsequently, the therapeutic outcomes were evaluated by measuring the infarct volume, neurological deficits, and neuron survival. The results showed that the autophagic activities of Beclin1 and LC3-II in neurons were markedly promoted by 7 days of EGb-761 therapy. Meanwhile, the autophagic cargoes of insoluble p62 and ubiquitinated proteins were effectively degraded by EGb-761-augmented lysosomal activity of cathepsin B and cathepsin D. Moreover, the infarction size, neurological deficiencies, and neuron death were also substantially attenuated by EGb-761 therapy. Taken together, our study suggests that EGb-761 exerts a neuroprotective effect against ischemic stroke by promoting autophagic/lysosomal signaling in neurons at the penumbra. Thus, it might be a new therapeutic target for treating ischemic stroke.",

However, the role of GBE in alleviating fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) in laying hens and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of GBE on relieving FLHS with an emphasis on the modulatory role of GBE in chicken gut microbiota. RESULTS: The results showed that GBE treatment ameliorated biochemical blood indicators in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced FLHS laying hen model by decreasing the levels of TG, TC, ALT and ALP. The lipid accumulation and pathological score of liver were also relieved after GBE treatment. Moreover, GBE treatment enhanced the antioxidant activity of liver and serum by increasing GSH, SOD, T-AOC, GSH-PX and reducing MDA, and downregulated the expression of genes related to lipid synthesis (FAS, LXRα, GPAT1, PPARγ and ChREBP1) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, TLR4 and NF-κB) in the liver. Microbial profiling analysis revealed that GBE treatment reshaped the HFD-perturbed gut microbiota, particularly elevated the abundance of Megasphaera in the cecum. Meanwhile, targeted metabolomic analysis of SCFAs revealed that GBE treatment significantly promoted the production of total SCFAs, acetate and propionate, which were positively correlated with the GBE-enriched gut microbiota. Finally, we confirmed that the GBE-altered gut microbiota was sufficient to alleviate FLHS by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). CONCLUSIONS: We provided evidence that GBE alleviated FLHS in HFD-induced laying hens through reshaping the composition of gut microbiota. Our findings shed light on mechanism underlying the anti-FLHS efficacy of GBE and lay foundations for future use of GBE as additive to prevent and control FLHS in laying hen industry."

Flavonoids extracted from G. biloba are beneficial to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) have been recognized to play important roles in plant secondary metabolism. In this study, GbbZIP08 was isolated and characterized. It encodes a protein containing 154 amino acids, which belongs to hypocotyl 5 in group H of the bZIP family. Tobacco transient expression assay indicated that GbbZIP08 was localized in the plant nucleus. GbbZIP08 overexpression showed that the contents of total flavonoids, kaempferol, and anthocyanin in transgenic tobacco were significantly higher than those in the wild type. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed significant upregulation of structural genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. In addition, phytohormone signal transduction pathways, such as the abscisic acid, salicylic acid, auxin, and jasmonic acid pathways, were enriched with a large number of differentially expressed genes. TFs such as MYB, AP2, WRKY, NAC, bZIP, and bHLH, were also differentially expressed. The above results indicated that GbbZIP08 overexpression promoted flavonoid accumulation and increased the transcription levels of flavonoid-synthesis-related genes in plants.",

      "abstract": "Military personnel during combat or peacekeeping operations are exposed to extreme climates of hot or cold environments for longer durations. Spinal cord injury is quite common in military personnel following central nervous system (CNS) trauma indicating a possibility of altered pathophysiological responses at different ambient temperatures. Our previous studies show that the pathophysiology of brain injury is exacerbated in animals acclimated to cold (5 °C) or hot (30 °C) environments. In these diverse ambient temperature zones, trauma exacerbated oxidative stress generation inducing greater blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cell damage. Extracts of Ginkgo biloba EGb-761 and BN-52021 treatment reduces brain pathology following heat stress. This effect is further improved following TiO2 nanowired delivery in heat stress in animal models. Several studies indicate the role of EGb-761 in attenuating spinal cord induced neuronal damages and improved functional deficit. This is quite likely that these effects are further improved following nanowired delivery of EGb-761 and BN-52021 with cerebrolysin-a balanced composition of several neurotrophic factors and peptide fragments in spinal cord trauma. In this review, TiO2 nanowired delivery of EGb-761 and BN-52021 with nanowired cerebrolysin is examined in a rat model of spinal cord injury at cold environment. Our results show that spinal cord injury aggravates cord pathology in cold-acclimated rats and nanowired delivery of EGb-761 and BN-52021 with cerebrolysin significantly induced superior neuroprotection, not reported earlier.",

Excess sodium metavanadate is a potential environmental toxin when consumed and could induce oxidative damage leading to various neurological disorders and Parkinsons-like diseases. This study is designed to investigate the impact of the flavonoid Glycoside Fraction of Ginkgo Biloba Extract (GBE) (at 30 mg/kg body weight) on vanadium-treated rats. Animals were divided randomly into four groups: Control (Ctrl, normal saline), Ginkgo Biloba (GIBI, 30mg/kg BWT), Vanadium (VANA, 10 mg/kg BWT) and Vanadium + Ginkgo biloba (VANA + GIBI). Markers of oxidative stress (Glutathione Peroxidase and Catalase) were assessed and found to be statistically increased with GIBI when compared with CTRL and treatment groups. Results from routine staining revealed that the control and GIBI group had a normal distribution of cells and a pronounced increase in cell count respectively compared to the VANA group. When compared to the VANA group, the NeuN photomicrographs revealed that the levels of GIBI were within the normal range (***p < 0.001; ** p < 001). The treatment with GIBI showed a better response by increasing the neuronal cells in the VANA+GIBI when compared with the VANA group. The NLRP3 Inflammasome photomicrographs denoted that there was a decrease in NLRP3-positive cells in the control and GIBI groups. The treatment group shows fewer cells compared to that of the VANA group. The treatment group shows fewer cells compared to that of the VANA group. The findings of the study confirmed that ginkgo biloba extract via its flavonoid glycoside fraction has favorable impacts in modulating vanadium-induced brain damage with the potential ability to lower antioxidant levels and reduce neuroinflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba extract preparations are commonly used in ophthalmology to improve circulatory disorders and provide neurotrophic support for the treatment of optic neuropathy. However, their use also carries a higher risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), some of which can be severe and even life-threatening, such as anaphylactic shock. This case report highlights the importance of recognizing and managing ADRs associated with ginkgo biloba extract in ophthalmology clinical practice. This report aims to emphasize the need for appropriate patient selection, adherence to prescribing guidelines, and proactive measures to reduce ADR occurrence. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a patient who experienced a severe ADR following the administration of Ginkgo biloba and Damo injection. The patient, a middle-aged individual without a history of allergies, developed anaphylactic shock within 30 minutes of medication initiation. Prompt medical intervention, including medication withdrawal, resuscitation, and intensive care unit transfer, led to symptom relief and successful recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores the need for vigilance when prescribing ginkgo biloba extract, particularly in middle-aged and elderly patients. Despite no previous history of allergies and adherence to the prescribed dosage, severe ADR can still occur. Close monitoring of patients within the first 30 minutes of medication administration is crucial. Furthermore, strict adherence to drug instructions, proper TCM syndrome differentiation, appropriate choice of infusion solvents, and strict control of drip rates should be considered to enhance patient safety. Other factors such as patient age, allergy history, and initial medication were also identified as important considerations in preventing ADRs. This case report emphasizes the significance of early identification, immediate withdrawal of medication, vital sign monitoring, and timely administration of anti-allergy drugs in managing ADR.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba L. leaves (GBLs) play a substantial role in the treatment of vascular dementia (VD); however, the underlying mechanisms of action are unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate the mechanisms of action of GBLs in the treatment of VD through network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. METHODS: The active ingredients and related targets of GBLs were screened using the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology, Swiss Target Prediction and GeneCards databases, and the VD-related targets were screened using the OMIM, DrugBank, GeneCards, and DisGeNET databases, and the potential targets were identified using a Venn diagram. We used Cytoscape 3.8.0 software and the STRING platform to construct traditional Chinese medicine-active ingredient-potential target and protein-protein interaction networks, respectively. After gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of potential targets using the DAVID platform, the binding affinity between key active ingredients and targets was analyzed by molecular docking, and finally, the top 3 proteins-ligand pairs with the best binding were simulated by molecular dynamics to verify the molecular docking results. RESULTS: A total of 27 active ingredients of GBLs were screened and 274 potential targets involved in the treatment of VD were identified. Quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, and ginkgolide B were the core ingredients for treatment, and AKT1, TNF, IL6, VEGFA, IL1B, TP53, CASP3, SRC, EGFR, JUN, and EGFR were the main targets of action. The main biological processes involved apoptosis, inflammatory response, cell migration, lipopolysaccharide response, hypoxia response, and aging. PI3K/Akt appeared to be a key signaling pathway for GBLs in the treatment of VD. Molecular docking displayed strong binding affinity between the active ingredients and the targets. Molecular dynamics simulation results further verified the stability of their interactions. CONCLUSION SUBSECTIONS: This study revealed the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the treatment of VD by GBLs using multi-ingredient, multi-target, and multi-pathway interactions, providing a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment and lead drug development of VD.",

      "abstract": "Ginkgo biloba L. leaf extract (GBE) has been added in many commercial herbal formulations such as EGb 761 and Shuxuening Injection to treat cardiovascular diseases and stroke worldwide. However, the comprehensive effects of GBE on cerebral ischemia remained unclear. Using a novel GBE (nGBE), which consists of all the compounds of traditional (t)GBE and one new compound, pinitol, we investigated its effect on inflammation, white matter integrity, and long-term neurological function in an experimental stroke model. Both transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and distal MCAO were conducted in male C57/BL6 mice. We found that nGBE significantly reduced infarct volume at 1, 3, and 14 days after ischemia. Sensorimotor and cognitive functions were superior in nGBE treated mice after MCAO. nGBE inhibited the release of IL-1β in the brain, promoted microglial ramification, and regulated the microglial M1 to M2 phenotype shift at 7 days post injury. In vitro analyses showed that nGBE treatment reduced the production of IL-1β and TNFα in primary microglia. Administration of nGBE also decreased the SMI-32/MBP ratio and enhanced myelin integrity, thus exhibiting improved white matter integrity at 28 days post stroke. These findings demonstrate that nGBE protects against cerebral ischemia by inhibiting microglia-related inflammation and promoting white matter repair, suggesting that nGBE is a promising therapeutic strategy for long-term recovery after stroke.",

It is yet uncertain, nevertheless, if treatment with Ginkgo biloba supplements (GBS), a flavonoid-rich natural product can lessen the adverse effects of lead on endothelial and testicular functions. This study investigated the impact of Ginkgo biloba supplementation on lead-induced endothelial and testicular dysfunctions. METHODS: The animals were treated with GBS (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg orally) for 14 days following oral exposure to lead acetate (25 mg/kg) for 14 days. After euthanasia, blood samples, epididymal sperm, testes, and aorta were collected. The quantities of the hormones (testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), as well as the anti-apoptotic, oxidative, nitrergic, inflammatory markers, were then determined using immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and conventional biochemical methods. RESULTS: GBS reduced lead-induced oxidative stress by increasing the levels of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), while lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) in endothelium and testicular cells. Normal testicular weight was restored by GBS which also decreased endothelial endothelin-I and increased nitrite levels. TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased while Bcl-2 protein expression was enhanced. Lead-induced alterations in reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, and testosterone) were also restored to normal. CONCLUSION: According to our result, using Ginkgo biloba supplement prevented lead from causing endothelial and testicular dysfunction by raising pituitary-testicular hormone levels, boosting Bcl-2 protein expression and lowering oxidative and inflammatory stress in the endothelium and testes.",

We investigated whether co-administration of St. John's wort and Ginkgo biloba extracts can suppress tinnitus. Participants with subjective tinnitus aged 30-70 years were randomly assigned to the experimental (co-administration of St. John's wort and Ginkgo biloba extract; n = 20) or control (Ginkgo biloba extract only; n = 26) group for 12 weeks. Participants were blinded to the group assignments. After 12 weeks of treatment, no significant change in the minimum masking level on the tinnitogram was observed in either group. In the co-administration group, the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score decreased from 34.7 (SD, 15.9) to 29.6 (16.0) (p = 0.102). However, the control group showed a significant decrease in THI score, from 30.5 (16.7) to 25.6 (17.1) (p = 0.046). Regarding the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), only the \"Social Functioning\" domain score changed significantly after extract co-administration, from 74.5 (21.5) to 83.9 (20.5) (p = 0.047). Co-administration of St. John's wort and Ginkgo biloba extracts did not improve the symptoms of subjective tinnitus compared to administration of Ginkgo biloba extract alone."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease(CHD) with stable angina pectoris is a common cardiovascular disease. It has been reported that 10%-81.4% of these patients suffer from psychological conditions,such as depression, which has been associated with more frequent angina, lower treatment satisfaction and lower perceived quality of life. Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE), the raw material of Ginkgo biloba dropping pills (GBDPs), is widely used to treat various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, and depression. This clinical trial aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of GBDPs in improving the frequency of angina pectoris and the life quality of patients with stable angina pectoris and depression symptoms. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and multicentre clinical trial will be conducted in four medical centres in China. We aim to recruit approximately 72 participants aged 18-75 years with depression and coronary heart disease with stable angina pectoris. Based on conventional drug treatment, participants will be randomly assignedto the treatment group (GBDPs group; n=36) or the control group (placebo group; n=36) at a 1:1 allocation ratio. After randomisation,follow-up will be done at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks (±3 days). Additionally, 30 healthy individuals will be enrolled to investigate the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of the effects of GBE. The primary outcomes will be the Seattle Angina Questionnaire score and the frequency of angina pectoris-related symptoms each week. The secondary outcomes will include the 36-item Short Form Health Survey quality-of-life scale, Hamilton Depression Scale and composite endpoint incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, China (approval number: ZYYECK [2020]030). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The results of this trial will be publicly shared through academic conferences and peer-reviewed journals.

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a highly recurrent gastrointestinal disorder and global public health issue. However, it lacks effective and safe strategies for its control. Although Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has been suggested to exhibit preventive and therapeutic activity for the control of IBD, whether its activity is associated with its ability to modulate intestinal microbiota remains to be addressed. To investigate the effect of GBE on controlling IBD, a Citrobacter Rodentium (CR)-induced mouse colitis model was used, and then histopathological examinations, biochemical assays, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting were performed to detect histological changes, cytokines, and tight junction (TJ) proteins in the intestine samples. We also studied 16s rRNA to detect changes in intestinal microbiota and used GC-MS to determine the microbiota-related metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results of our studies revealed that pre-treatment with GBE was sufficient for protecting the animals from CR-induced colitis. As a mechanism for GBE activity, GBE treatment was able to modulate the intestinal microbiota and increase the SCFAs capable of decreasing the pro-inflammatory factors and up-regulating the anti-inflammatory factors while elevating the intestinal-barrier-associated proteins to maintain the integrity of the intestines. Accordingly, our results led to a strong suggestion that GBE should be seriously considered in the preventive control of CR-induced colitis and in the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies for controlling IBD.",

Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) can alleviate RIF induced by cisplatin (CDDP). PURPOSE: To elucidate the effect of EGb treatment on cisplatin-induced RIF and reveal its potential mechanism. METHODS: The two main active components in EGb were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Rats were induced by CDDP and then treated with EGb, 2ME2 (HIF-1α inhibitor) or amifostine. After HK-2 cells and HIF-1α siRNA HK-2 cells were treated with CDDP, EGb or amifostine, the conditioned medium from each group was cultured with NRK-49F cells. The renal function of rats was detected. The renal damage and fibrosis were evaluated by H&E and Masson trichrome staining. The IL-6 content in the cell medium was detected by ELISA. The expression levels of indicators related to renal fibrosis and signaling pathway were examined by western blotting and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: HPLC analysis showed that the contents of quercetin and kaempferol in EGb were 36.0 μg/ml and 45.7 μg/ml, respectively. In vivo, EGb and 2ME2 alleviated renal damage and fibrosis, as well as significantly decreased the levels of α-SMA, HIF-1α, STAT3 and IL-6 in rat tissues induced by CDDP. In vitro, the levels of HIF-1α, STAT3 and IL-6 were significantly increased in HK-2 cells and HIF-1α siRNA HK-2 cells induced by CDDP. Notably, HIF-1α siRNA significantly decreased the levels of HIF-1α, STAT3 and IL-6 in HK-2 cells, as well as the IL-6 level in medium from HK-2 cells. Additionally, the α-SMA level in NRK-49F cells was significantly increased after being cultured with conditioned medium from HK-2 cells or HIF-1α siRNA HK-2 cells exposed to CDDP. Furthermore, exogenous IL-6 increased the α-SMA level in NRK-49F cells. Importantly, the expression levels of the above-mentioned indicators were significantly decreased after the HK-2 cells and HIF-1α siRNA HK-2 cells were treated with EGb. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that EGb improves CDDP-induced RIF, and the mechanism may be related to its inhibition of the renal fibroblast activation by down-regulating the HIF-1α/STAT3/IL-6 pathway in renal tubular epithelial cells.",

The persistence of recognition memory has been evidenced by using behavioral tagging in young adult rats, but it has not been effective on aging. Here, we investigated the effects of treatment with a standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) associated with novelty on the consolidation of object location memory (OLM) and its persistence after weak training of spatial object preference in young adult and aged rats. The object location task used in this study included two habituation sessions, training sessions associated or not associated with EGb treatment and contextual novelty, and short-term or long-term retention testing sessions. Altogether, our data showed that treatment with EGb associated with novelty close to the time of encoding resulted in STM that lasted for 1 h and persisted for 24 h for both young adult and aged rats. In aged rats, the cooperative mechanisms induced robust long-term OLM. Our findings support and extend our knowledge about recognition memory in aged rats and the modulating effects of EGb treatment and contextual novelty on the persistence of memory.",

Quantified Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® has been used to treat cognitive dysfunction, functional impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Objectives: To assess the cognitive-related effects of EGb 761® treatment in patients after acute ischemic stroke, as well as the feasibility of patient selection and outcome measures. Methods: We conducted a randomized, multicentric, open-label trial at 7 centers in China. Patients scoring 20 or lower on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale were enrolled between 7 and 14 days after stroke onset and randomly assigned to receive 240 mg per day of EGb 761® or no additional therapy for 24 weeks in a 1:1 ratio. Both groups received standard treatments for the prevention of recurrent stroke during the trial. General cognitive function and a battery of cognitive tests for sub-domains were evaluated at 24 weeks. All patients were monitored for adverse events. Results: 201 patients ≥50 years old were included, with 100 assigned to the EGb 761® group and 101 to the reference group. The mean change from baseline on the global cognitive function as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 2.92 in the EGb 761® group and 1.33 in the reference group (between-group difference: 1.59 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 2.67; p < 0.005). For cognitive domains, EGb 761® showed greater effects on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Total Recall (EGb 761® change 1.40 vs. reference -0.49) and Form 1 of the Shape Trail Test (EGb 761® change -38.2 vs. reference -15.6). Potentially EGb 761®-related adverse events occurred in no more than 3% of patients. Conclusion: Over the 24-week period, EGb 761® treatment improved overall cognitive performance among patients with mild to moderate ischemic stroke. Our findings provide valuable recommendations for the design of future trials, including the criteria for patient selection. Clinical Trial Registration: www.isrctn.com, identifier ISRCTN11815543."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Ginkgo biloba Linn (Ginkgoaceae) [leaves extract (GBE)] is authorized for the treatment of sudden hearing loss (SHL); however, its clinical feasibility in SHL has not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant GBE in the treatment of SHL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, China Biomedical Database for literature research, starting from inception to 30 June 2022. The key terms: Ginkgo biloba extract, Sudden Sensorineural Deafness. This meta-analysis contained randomized controlled trials that compared the safety and efficacy of the combination of GBE and general treatments (GT) with GT alone for SHL. The extracted data were analyzed using Revman5.4 software with risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and mean difference (MD). RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 27 articles with a total of 2623 patients. The results revealed that the effects of GBE adjuvant therapy was superior than GT (total effective rate: RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.18-1.26, p < 0.00001), the pure tone hearing threshold (MD = 12.29, 95% CI: 11.74-12.85, p < 0.00001) and hemorheology indexes (whole blood high shear viscosity: MD = 1.46, 95% CI: 0.47-2.44, p = 0.004) after treatment were significantly improved compared to non-treatment, while there was no significant difference as for hematocrit (red blood cells) (MD = 4.15, 95% CI: -7.15-15.45, p = 0.47). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of GBE + GT for the treatment of SHL may be more promising than GT alone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials testing Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 in patients with mild forms of cognitive impairment were conducted before widely accepted terms and diagnostic criteria for such conditions were available. This makes it difficult to compare any results from earlier and more recent trials. The objective of this systematic review was to provide a descriptive overview of clinical trials of EGb 761 in patients who met the diagnostic criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder (mild NCD) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5). METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE were searched for randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trials of EGb 761 in mild impairment of cognitive functioning. All trials involving patients who met retrospectively applied diagnostic criteria for mild NCD were included. Trials of primary prevention of dementia and trials of combinations of medical treatments were excluded. RESULTS: Among 298 records found in databases and 76 further records related to EGb 761 in references of systematic reviews, 9 reports on clinical trials involving 946 patients met the pre-specified criteria for inclusion. Beneficial effects of EGb 761 were seen in neuropsychological tests (8 of 9 studies), scales for neuropsychiatric symptoms (3 of 3 studies), geriatric rating scales (1 of 2 studies) and global ratings of change (1 of 1 study). Significant effects were found in several domains of cognition (memory, speed of processing, attention and executive functioning). Among the neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression (2 of 3 studies) and anxiety (1 of 1 study) were significantly improved. No differences between EGb 761 treatment and placebo were seen with regard to the rates of adverse events. DISCUSSION: The included studies demonstrate treatment benefits of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761, mainly on cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms, in patients with mild NCD. The drug was safe and well tolerated."

      "abstract": "As a potential drug candidate for the treatment of hypertension and complications, it is speculated that the component-based Chinese medicine of Ginkgo biloba leaves (GBCCM) which mainly composed of flavonoid aglycones (FAs) and terpene lactones (TLs) may have different pharmacological effects at different doses or ratios. Taking the normal mice as the study object, metabonomics was conducted by giving different doses of GBCCM. Based on the components of GBCCM absorbed into the blood, the network pharmacological prediction was carried out. By integrating the results of metabonomics and network pharmacology, predict the possible pharmacological effects of GBCCM and conduct experimental verification. It was found that eight of the 19 compounds in GBCCM could be absorbed into the blood. GBCCM mainly affected the signal pathways of unsaturated fatty acid, pyruvate, bile acid, melanin and stem cells. It was speculated that GBCCM might have activities such as lowering blood pressure, regulating stem cell proliferation and melanogenesis. By establishing the models of mushroom tyrosinase, rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), we found that FAs and TLs showed synergistic effect in hypertension and tyrosinase models, and the optimal ratio was 3:2 (4.4 mg/kg) and 1:1 (0.4 mg/ml), respectively. As effective substances, FAs significantly promoted the proliferation of rat BMSCs on the third and fifth days at the concentration of 0.2 μg/ml (p < 0.05). GBCCM showed a variety of pharmacological effects at different doses and ratios, which provided an important reference for the druggability of GBCCM."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of the effectiveness and safety of ginkgo biloba preparations combined with donepezil hydrochloride vs. donepezil for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Three English databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE), and four Chinese databases [the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CKNI), the Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), the Chongqing VIP database, and WANFANG DATA)] were manually searched for literature published from the respective dates of inception of the databases to December 2022. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ginkgo biloba preparations with donepezil hydrochloride vs. donepezil for the treatment of AD were included. Relevant literature was screened, and the data in the included studies were extracted for quality assessment according to the Risk of bias tool. The RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,642 participants were enrolled in the 18 RCTs. Of these, 842 were in the experimental group (ginkgo biloba preparations combined with donepezil hydrochloride) and 800 were in the control group (donepezil). The overall methodological quality of the included RCTs is poor due to the high risks of blindness and allocation concealment. The meta-analysis results showed statistically significant differences in several outcomes including Risk Ratio (RR) in change for clinical effectiveness rate (1.23, 95% CI 1.13, 1.34, P < 0.00001), mean difference (MD) in change for Mini-Mental State Examination score (3.02, 95% CI 2.14, 3.89, P < 0.00001), Activity of Daily Living Scale score (-4.56, 95% CI -5.09, -4.03, P < 0.00001), Hasegawa Dementia Scale score (2.04, 95% CI 1.74, 2.34, P < 0.00001), Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (2.38, 95% CI 0.72, 4.06, P = 0.005), between the experimental and control groups. But there is no statistically significant difference in change for adverse reaction (0.91, 95% CI 0.58, 1.42, P = 0.69). CONCLUSION: Ginkgo biloba preparations plus donepezil can improve clinical effectiveness rate and vocabulary memory outcomes. However, more relevant high-quality RCTs are needed in the future to validate these results. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Identifier CRD42022378970."

      "abstract": "Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) is a common dietary supplement used by people with dyslipidaemia worldwide to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Many studies have found that GBE itself has a variety of pharmacological activities. However, the role of GBE as an adjunct to conventional therapy with chemical drugs remains controversial. Therefore, this study explored the additional benefits of GBE in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia with statins in terms of both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A hyperlipidaemia model was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet for a long time. The animals were treated with atorvastatin only, GBE only, or a combination of atorvastatin and GBE. The results showed that statins combined with GBE could significantly improve the blood lipid parameters, reduce the liver fat content, and reduce the size of adipocytes in abdominal fat. The effect was superior to statin therapy alone. In addition, the combination has shown additional liver protection against possible pathological liver injury or statin-induced liver injury. A lipidomic study showed that GBE could regulate the abnormal lipid metabolism of the liver in hyperlipemia. When statins are combined with GBE, this callback effect introduced by GBE on endogenous metabolism has important implications for resistance to disease progression and statin resistance. Finally, in the presence of GBE, there was a significant increase in plasma statin exposure. These results all confirmed that GBE has incremental benefits as a dietary supplement of statin therapy for dyslipidaemia.",

      "abstract": "The popular dietary supplements of Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgo) products have been reported to have anti-cancer activities in multiple cellular and animal studies, with the benefits yet to be proven with clinical trials. The mechanisms of action are not clear, forming a barrier to investigation in Gingko-specific benefits to cancer patients, especially when combined with other therapies. Here we reported on the discovery of a novel mechanism by which a Ginkgo golden leaf extract (GGLE) inhibited melanoma cell invasion and angiogenesis. GGLE did not inhibit melanoma cells via direct cytotoxicity. Instead, GGLE significantly inhibited total RNase activities in melanoma cells under both normoxia and hypoxia conditions. The RNase angiogenin was induced twofolds by hypoxia, and the induction was significantly suppressed by GGLE treatment in a dose dependent manner. As a result of angiogenin inhibition, GGLE inhibited melanoma cell migration and invasion in a dose dependent manner. Conditioned media from melanoma cell culture sufficiently induced in vitro angiogenesis in human endothelial cells, whereas the conditioned media of GGLE-treated melanoma cells significantly inhibited this angiogenetic activity. This was accompanied with markedly reduced angiogenin concentrations in the GGLE-treated melanoma cell conditioned media. We concluded that, instead of direct cytotoxicity, GGLE inhibited angiogenin synthesis and secretion by melanoma cells, resulting in inhibition of tumor cell invasion and tumor-induced angiogenesis. This new mechanism opens the door for investigation in GGLE influencing tumor microenvironment, and warrants further investigation and validation in vivo.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative illnesses, and yet, no workable treatments have been discovered to prevent or reverse AD. Curcumin (CUR), the major polyphenolic compound of turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizomes, and Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) are natural substances derived from conventional Chinese herbs that have long been shown to provide therapeutic advantages for AD. The uptake of curcumin into the brain is severely restricted by its low ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Meanwhile, GBE has been shown to improve BBB permeability. The present study evaluated the neuroprotective effects and pharmacokinetic profile of curcumin and GBE combination to find out whether GBE can enhance curcumin's beneficial effects in AD by raising its brain concentration. Results revealed that CUR + GBE achieved significantly higher levels of curcumin in the brain and plasma after 30 min and 1 h of oral administration, compared to curcumin alone, and this was confirmed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The effect of combined oral treatment, for 28 successive days, on cognitive function and other AD-like alterations was studied in scopolamine-heavy metal mixtures (SCO + HMM) AD model in rats. The combination reversed at least, partially on the learning and memory impairment induced by SCO + HMM. This was associated with a more pronounced inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), caspase-3, hippocampal amyloid beta (Aβ1-42), and phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) count, and pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukine-1beta (IL-1β), as compared to the curcumin alone-treated group. Additionally, the combined treatment significantly decreased lipid peroxidation (MDA) and increased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), when compared with the curcumin alone. These findings support the concept that the combination strategy might be an alternative therapy in the management/prevention of neurological disorders. This study sheds light on a new approach for exploring new phyto-therapies for AD and emphasizes that more research should focus on the synergic effects of herbal drugs in future.",

Ginkgo biloba is a living fossil that has remained essentially unchanged for more than 200 million years, and now has become widespread worldwide due to the medicinal active ingredients in its leaves. Here, 37 WRKY genes were identified, which were distributed randomly in nine chromosomes of G. biloba. Results of the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the GbWRKY could be divided into three groups. Furthermore, the expression patterns of GbWRKY genes were analyzed. Gene expression profiling and qRT-PCR revealed that different members of GbWRKY have different spatiotemporal expression patterns in different abiotic stresses. Most of the GbWRKY genes can respond to UV-B radiation, drought, high temperature and salt treatment. Meanwhile, all GbWRKY members performed phylogenetic tree analyses with the WRKY proteins of other species which were known to be associated with abiotic stress. The result suggested that GbWRKY may play a crucial role in regulating multiple stress tolerances. Additionally, GbWRKY13 and GbWRKY37 were all located in the nucleus, while GbWRKY15 was located in the nucleus and cytomembrane.",
