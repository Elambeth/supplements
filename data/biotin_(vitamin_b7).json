      "abstract": "Melanocytes play a crucial role in skin pigmentation and protection against UV radiation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating melanocyte function is essential for elucidating skin pigmentation disorders and melanoma progression. This protocol details a comprehensive methodology for characterizing the cell surface subproteome of melanocytes and melanoma cell lines, utilizing aminooxy biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry analysis. The initial step involves selectively labeling cell surface proteins with aminooxy biotin on live melanocytes and melanoma cell lines to specifically tag glycoproteins. Labeled proteins are then captured on NeutrAvidin beads. Following multiple wash steps to minimize contamination with non-cell surface proteins, mass spectrometry is employed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the enriched subproteome, facilitating the identification and characterization of surface proteins. This is a sensitive method for profiling the cell surface subproteome in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines in vitro, offering deeper insights into their molecular composition. This protocol holds promise for advancing our understanding of melanoma and may aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets for melanoma treatment.",

      "abstract": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel residing primarily at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, plays a major role in fluid secretion and the maintenance of epithelial surface hydration. Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to the fatal disease known as cystic fibrosis (CF). Drugs that improve mutant CFTR protein folding and channel function have dramatically improved CF patient outcomes. However, the current regimen only restores the function of the most common mutant, ΔF508, to ~62% of wildtype (WT). Notably, ~10% of patients harboring hundreds of less common CFTR mutations are not eligible or do not respond at all to treatment with current CFTR modulators. Better characterizing the WT and mutant CFTR protein interactomes could provide critical insight into how to treat patients with rarer mutations and thereby improve the druggability of this devastating disease. Here we describe how BioID (proximity-dependent biotin identification) can be used to map the CFTR interactome in a human airway model-bronchial epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface. Approximately 26% (>5500) of all human protein-coding genes are predicted to code for membrane proteins, which together account for ~30% of the druggable proteome. The methods described here could thus also be applied to improve our understanding of many additional respiratory, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with poor clinical outcome. There is a dire need for the development of new targeted therapies for TNBC. Midkine (MDK), a multifunctional cytokine/growth factor, functions as an oncoprotein and its expression is elevated in various cancers. The absence of small molecule inhibitors targeting MDK represents a significant knowledge gap for translation. In this study, we identified HBS-101 as a potent MDK-inhibitor with high specificity. Our modeling studies revealed that the interaction of HBS-101 with MDK is primarily driven by hydrophobic forces, and this interaction disrupted MDK's binding to its endogenous receptors. Microscale thermophoresis (MST), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and biotin pulldown studies confirmed the direct interaction of HBS-101 with MDK. Therapeutically, HBS-101 treatment significantly reduced cell viability (IC50 0.3-2.8 µM), clonogenic survival, invasiveness, and increased apoptosis. The underlying mechanism of HBS-101 involves suppression of Akt/mTOR, STAT3, and NF-B pathways. Importantly, HBS-101 exhibits distinct pharmacologic advantages, including oral bioavailability, blood-brain-barrier penetration, and in vivo stability. Histologically, up to a dose of 10 mg/kg showed no observable organ toxicity and had no effect on the mice's body weight. Dose range studies identified 5 mg/kg as the minimal effective dose, achieving more than 50% tumor reduction. HBS-101 treatment led to a significant reduction in the growth of TNBC patient-derived xenograft tumors in vivo and markedly reduced TNBC brain-metastatic-tumor growth and prolonged mice survival. Collectively, our studies identified a first-in-class MDK inhibitor, HBS-101, that can be used to treat MDK-driven cancers."

      "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent type of head and neck cancer, comprising over 90% of all oral malignancies worldwide. The identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers for OSCC is crucial for improving patient outcomes, as early detection and treatment are critical for the successful management of this disease. Previously, we demonstrated that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) are prognostic markers for OSCC; however, their role in OSCC development remains unclear. To investigate this, we used TurboID-based proximity labeling to identify the interactomes of NDRG1 and PGK1 in HEK293 cells. Herein, protein abundance patterns from three time points were used for clustering 364 proteins with a \"fast\" or \"slow\" response to biotin. Of these, 65 proteins were also identified in neoplastic islands of OSCC patients from our previous study, and 28 of these proteins have their gene expression associated with prognostic features, including death, metastasis, and relapse. PRM-MS enabled the quantification of 17 of these proteins, providing further evidence of their presence in the OSCC prognostic interactome. Finally, we characterized a prognostic-associated interactome composed of 28 proteins, which enabled the prioritization of candidates that can be further explored in OSCC progression. The mass spectrometry data generated in this study have been deposited in ProteomeXchange with the data set identifier PXD048046."

Seventy-five healthy male Kunming mice were randomly assigned to five treatment groups: the control group (C), the biotin control group (BC), the acetate gossypol control group (AGC), the biotin prevention group (BP) and the biotin treatment group (BT). The study examined the growth performance, visceral index, serum biochemical profiles and histomorphological changes of mice. The results showed that compared with AGC group mice, the average daily feed intake of BP group and BT group increased by 40.47 and 45.69% (p < 0.05). Biotin prevention reduced the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in acetate gossypol-treated mice, biotin treatment reduced the elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein (TP) and BUN levels in acetate gossypol-treated mice (p < 0.05). Biotin increase the values of villus height/crypt depth in duodenum and jejunum (p < 0.05). In conclusion, biotin potentially increase the growth performance of acetate gossypol-treated mice, it also has a positive effect on serum biochemical profiles, and histomorphological of acetate gossypol-treated mice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical evidence suggests that pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and heart failure (HF) often co-exist; however, the specific impact of PF on HF remains underexplored. This gap in understanding complicates the management and treatment of HF in patients with PF. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of PF on cardiac function and myocardial fibrosis using a mouse PF model and evaluate the therapeutic potential of wogonin, a flavonoid compound known for its anti-PF properties. METHODS: A PF mouse model was established via intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM). Starting on day 8 post-BLM treatment, wogonin (50 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered every 2 days for 2 weeks. Cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography, while myocardial fibrosis was evaluated through Masson staining. In vitro, H9C2 cardiomyocytes were exposed to CoCl2 or H2O2 for 24 h with or without wogonin (20 μM) treatment. Apoptosis and DNA damage markers were analysed using immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and the Comet assay. The interaction between wogonin and Sirt1 was examined using biotin-affinity pulldown assays and molecular docking simulations. RESULTS: Mice with PF exhibited significant cardiac dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis. Wogonin treatment markedly improved ejection fraction and attenuated myocardial fibrosis in PF mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that wogonin alleviated DNA damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis by upregulating Sirt1 and downregulating γ-H2AX expression. Docking simulations predicted that wogonin forms a stable complex with Sirt1 through hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, which was further validated by biotin-affinity pulldown assays. CONCLUSION: Wogonin exerts protective effects against cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis in PF mice by modulating Sirt1/γ-H2AX-mediated pathways to reduce DNA damage and apoptosis. These findings suggest the potential of wogonin as a therapeutic agent for managing HF associated with PF."

      "abstract": "Bioorthogonal activation chemistries have great potential in the development of novel drug treatments due to their versatility, tunability, and the ability to generate therapies with improved spatial targeting. The upregulation of Cathepsin B is highly correlated with the development of cancers, however, few fluorescent probes or prodrugs-based on Cathepsin B activity have demonstrated high tumor selectivity, since Cathepsin B is expressed in a variety of normal tissues. In this study, we report a strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition-activation strategy whereby a para-azido safety-catch linker is triggered by the tumor locating Biotin-TCO (trans-cyclooctene) conjugate, with subsequent tumor-specific Cathepsin B-triggered activation, generating a fluorescent reporter/cytotoxic drug, with high tumor selectivity. Our results suggest that this dual AND-Gate strategy of orthogonal Biotin AND Cathepsin B action would be advantageous for tumor-specific fluorescence labelling, fluorescence-guided surgery and targeted treatment."

      "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapy, which have improved survival rates, drug resistance and immune-related side effects continue to necessitate the development of new treatments. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a key metabolite in the methionine cycle, has indicated potential for cancer therapy and enhancing chemotherapy sensitivity. However, its effects on NSCLC remain undetermined. In our study, SAM inhibits NSCLC growth and enhances chemosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SAM plays a significant regulatory role in autophagy and oxidative stress within NSCLC. Furthermore, we identified P62 as a critical target of SAM by constructing biotin-labeled SAM for immunocoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that P62 mediates SAM regulatory effects on NSCLC. Furthermore, by constructing truncated P62 expression plasmids for immunocoprecipitation experiments, we discovered that SAM inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway by directly targeting the ZZ and TB domains of the P62 protein, thereby blocking autophagy and activating oxidative stress. These findings highlight SAM as a novel inhibitor of the P62/NF-κB axis and suggest that SAM could be a potential therapeutic agent for NSCLC."

      "abstract": "In treatable neurometabolic disorders, early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment are key to improved survival and outcomes. Biallelic variants in SLC5A6 cause sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter deficiency (OMIM # 618973), which is treatable with high-dose pantothenic acid, biotin, and alpha lipoic acid. So far, the onset has been postnatal in all reported patients. A review of the prenatal imaging showed ventriculomegaly at 32 weeks of gestation. After birth, the infant exhibited developmental regression. At 6 months of age, he developed acute metabolic shock in the setting of a urinary tract infection. Rapid exome analysis identified compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in SLC5A6 and confirmed the diagnosis of sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter deficiency. After the infant was initiated on treatment with high-dose biotin and pantothenic acid, we noted dramatic improvements in the hematological, cutaneous, cardiac, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Although the infant showed no further regression, he continued to have significant psychomotor disability. A review of the findings during pregnancy showed that the infant already had enlarged ventricles in late pregnancy, and neuroimaging on day 12 of birth showed signs of energy failure in late pregnancy. Our review of previously reported patients suggested no clear genotype-phenotype correlations, but there was little intrafamilial variability in disease onset. The present observation, for the first time, provides clinical evidence of a fetal onset in sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter deficiency. The high risk of recurrence and the low intrafamilial variability in disease onset suggest that identification and prenatal treatment in the high-risk group may be of significance."

The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 2-IB in patients with ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion treated with endovascular thrombectomy. The secondary objective was to investigate preliminary efficacy. METHODS: In this single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2a study, patients received continuous infusion of 2-IB or placebo for 24 hours. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability measured by vital parameters and pharmacokinetic parameters in the first 28 hours after treatment and serious adverse events up until 7 days. Secondary and additional outcomes included National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and infarct volume at 24 to 48 hours, mortality at 90 days, and (baseline-prognosis adjusted) modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. RESULTS: In the modified intention-to-treat population, 40 patients were randomized, 20 per treatment group. Median age was 76 (interquartile range [IQR], 66-82) years and 40% were female. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Vital parameters during treatment did not differ between groups. In total, 17 serious adverse events occurred, 6 (30%) in 2-IB and 11 (55%) in placebo. Median 2-IB exposure (AUCavg_4 h) was 320 (IQR, 243-395) ng h/mL. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at 7 days was 3 (IQR, 1-11) in 2-IB and 3 (IQR, 0-16) in placebo. Median infarct volume at 24 to 48 hours was 12.5 (IQR, 8.4-60.5) mL versus 13.7 (IQR, 4.0-94.5) mL. Median modified Rankin Scale at 3 months was 3 (IQR, 1-3) in the 2-IB group versus 3 (2-6) in placebo-treated patients. Mortality was 15% (3/20) in 2-IB versus 40% (8/20) in placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion treated with endovascular thrombectomy, 2-IB is safe and well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic parameters could be predicted well. The efficacy of 2-IB needs to be investigated further in a phase 2b/3 clinical trial. REGISTRATION: URL: www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl; Unique identifier: NL-OMON51194."

METHODS: SCD patients (n = 6) on chronic transfusion therapy received three aliquots of different (2 μg/mL, 6 μg/mL, and 18 μg/mL) biotin-dose labeled RBCs during one transfusion episode. Aliquots were from one unit labeled before (Pre-PR) and after PR treatment (PR-RBC) and from a conventional RBC unit. The full RBC units (PR and conventional) were transfused, followed by the labeled aliquots from those units. Serial flow cytometry analyses for acridine- and biotin-labeled RBCs were performed on 10 occasions over 16 weeks. Acridine surface density was quantitated using calibrated beads. RESULTS: Mean acridine surface density was 5062 molecules/PR-RBC at 1-4 h post-transfusion and declined 84.5% within 7 days, remaining detectable (180 molecules/PR-RBC) at 16 weeks. The biotin-labeled PR-RBC aliquots (initial enrichment 0.6%-1.4%) demonstrated near-identical survival kinetics as the entire acridine-labeled PR-RBC units (initial enrichment 7.5%-13.7%). Pre-PR, PR, and Conventional RBCs revealed non-linear RBC survival kinetics, with similar 24-h post-transfusion recoveries (PTR24) and half-lives (T50), but PR-RBC mean predicted lifespan (mean [SD] 104.4 [4.7] days) was decreased by 9.3% (Pre-PR-RBCs 115.1 [7.2] days, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Survival of amustaline/glutathione PR-RBCs can be tracked in vivo by flow cytometry for RBC surface acridine with similar sensitivity as biotin, without additional processing or radiolabeling."

      "abstract": "Tibia disorders in modern ducks are frequently associated with rapid weight gain and compromised bone quality, which is defined as the structural and material properties of bone tissue that determines its strength and fracture resistance. These factors significantly increase the risk of fractures and chronic pain. Studies suggest that 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D3), a vitamin D3 metabolite, effectively addresses bone disorders, potentially depending on dietary vitamin regimens, which are determined by the amount and ratio of vitamins in the diet. This study used a 2 × 2 factorial design to evaluate the effects of two vitamin regimens (regular and high) with or without exogenous 25-OH-D3 (0.069 mg/kg) on leg health and tibia quality in meat ducks (1-14 d). The high-vitamin regimen contained greater amounts of all vitamins except biotin and significantly enhanced ash content, tibial microstructure, fracture load, and reduced tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) scores (P < 0.05) compared to the regular regimen, despite no impact on growth performance or tibia length, weight, and diameter (P > 0.05). Additionally, dietary 25-OH-D3 supplementation increased weight gain (P < 0.05), improved bone quality, and strengthened bone formation and resorption processes. Notably, under the regular vitamin regimen, 25-OH-D3 reduced TD scores and enhanced weight gain, tibia mechanical properties, and the serum content of procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PN1P) that a marker of bone formation (all P < 0.05). However, these effects were diminished in ducks fed the high-vitamin diet. There were some interactions that were noticed regarding serum 25-OH-D3 content, trabecular area, tibia fracture load, and PN1P levels in the present study (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the biochemical effects of 25-OH-D3 were influenced by the baseline levels of dietary vitamins, a high-vitamin diet or treatment with 25-OH-D3 in a regular vitamin diet improved bone quality and reduced tibial dyschondroplasia by enhancing bone formation."

Here, three novel esterase-responsive prodrug-based amphiphiles, SCN1 ∼ SCN3, composed of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38, S) and di-(triazole-[12]aneN3, N) moiety through different length of carbon chain (C, 5, 7, 11‑carbon alkyl chains, respectively) were designed and synthesized. The amphiphiles displayed excellent self-assembly capabilities and the ability to effectively condense and release siRNA, and SCN2 showed the most effective in inhibiting proliferation of A549 cells. Furthermore, SCN2, siRNA, DOPE (D) and DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin (B) were co-assembled into hybrid nanoparticles (SCN2-DB/siRNA) with an average size of 198 nm, outstanding serum tolerance, high targeting capability, and biocompatibility. Additionally, the release of SN38 (80 %) and siPLK1 (abundant) were observed clearly in the presence of esterase. In vitro experiments verified that SCN2-DB/siPLK1 NPs could efficiently suppress the proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549 cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that SCN2-DB/siPLK1 NPs efficiently inhibited tumor growth (90 %) with negligible toxic side effects. The results showed that the combination of SN38 and siPLK1 through esterase-responsive amphiphile provided a strategy for lung cancer therapy that combined chemotherapy, gene therapy, and targeted delivery."

Here, a size-tunable micro-nano liposome system, PCAL@TM, is designed for targeted delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and oxygen to lung tumors. PTX-loaded corosolic acid (CA) nano-liposomes (PCAL, 100 nm) are anchored to the surface of oxygenated perfluorotributylamine (TBA)-loaded multivesicular liposomes (TM, 10 µm) via the biotin-avidin interactions with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) cleavable linker. After intravenous administration to lung tumor-bearing mice, the distribution amount of PCAL@TM in the lungs is extremely higher than that in the liver and spleen. The MMP-9-sensitive PCAL@TM can decouple into nano-PCAL and micro-TM in tumors; while, TMs enable breaking into smaller vesicles under vascular pressure, and release oxygen leading to the downregulation of HIF-1α and platelet-activated TGF-β. Meanwhile, PCAL can penetrate deeply into tumor by the tumor-targeted-penetrable CA liposomes, to promote the reduction of inflammation levels and enhance PTX-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD). Together, these results lead to the reversals of chemoresistance and tumor immunosuppressive, achieving significant improvement in PTX chemotherapy and α-PD-1 immunotherapy. The PCAL@TM system presents a novel strategy to enhance the efficiency of nano-drug delivery and the outcome of combined therapy for lung tumor."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency (HCSD) is an uncommon autosomal recessive genetic disorder that manifests with symptoms such as metabolic acidosis, lethargy, hypotonia, seizures, and persistent rashes, typically emerging during infancy. The HLCS gene has been identified as the source of pathogenic mutations associated with this condition. Cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency is another rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defects in cobalamin metabolism, attributable to mutations in the MMACHC gene. This disorder often leads to methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria and is classified into early-onset and late-onset types. The late-onset type is characterized by acute or chronic progressive neurological symptoms and behavioral disturbances. To date, there have been no documented cases worldwide of individuals diagnosed with both HCSD and cobalamin C deficiency. CASE PRESENTATION: This report details the case of an 11-year-and-9-month-old female patient from China who presented with symptoms including vomiting, altered consciousness, and a rash. Laboratory evaluations indicated the presence of metabolic acidosis, methylmalonic aciduria, and homocystinuria. Genetic analysis revealed mutations in the MMACHC gene: c.482G > A (p.R161Q) and c.567dup (p.I190Yfs∗13). Additionally, two previously unreported mutations in the HLCS gene, c.1922G > T (p.G641V) and c.1754C > T (p.P585L), were identified. She was diagnosed with Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency and Cobalamin C deficiency. The child showed significant improvement following treatment with hydroxocobalamin, betaine, and biotin. CONCLUSION: This article reports a case of adolescent onset HCSD and cobalamin C deficiency. Treatment with hydroxocobalamin, betaine, and biotin is effective. Two novel mutations in the HLCS gene causative for HCSD have been reported, providing a broader foundation for mutational screening and offering insights into the diagnosis and treatment of similar disorders."

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the nervous system caused by abnormal discharges from brain cells. Structural, infectious, metabolic, immunologic, and unknown causes can contribute to the development of seizures. In recent years, there has been increasing attention on epilepsy caused by genetic metabolic disorders. More than two hundred inherited metabolic disorders have been identified as potential cause of seizures, and they are mainly associated with energy deficiency in the brain, accumulation of toxic substances, abnormal neurotransmitter transmission, and deficiency of cofactors. Vitamins play a crucial role as components of several enzymes or coenzymes. Impaired metabolism of thiamine, biotin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid can contribute to early-onset seizures and developmental abnormalities in infants. However, timely supplementation therapy can significantly improve patient prognosis of affected patients. Therefore, a thorough understanding and investigation of the metabolic basis of epilepsy is essential for the development of precise therapeutic approaches, which could provide significant therapeutic benefits for patients."

      "abstract": "We report a case of a 19-year-old Somali American woman who presented with 6 months of progressive bilateral vision changes and ocular discharge, with systemic symptoms including angular cheilitis and dermatitis. The patient was evaluated with comprehensive ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography, corticospinal magnetic resonance imaging, and fundus imaging. Comprehensive ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral optic neuropathy. Laboratory testing showed a biotinidase level of <0.1 (normal, 5.5-10 nmol/min/ml). The patient was treated with oral biotin supplementation with improvement in her visual function. Furthermore, a review of the literature of reported cases of biotinidase deficiency optic neuropathy published between June 1987 and February 2024 revealed 40 cases. This entity presents more commonly in males (63%) (n = 27), with an average age of 11.7 ± 12.0 years (n = 35). Patients experienced symptoms for an average of 4.3 ± 8.3 years before they were correctly diagnosed (n = 25). Individuals had an average BCVA of 20/300 in the right eye and 20/250 in the left eye (n = 15) at the time of presentation. Additionally, 38.9% of patients had color vision deficits (n = 18), and 100% of patients had visual field deficits (n = 19). All patients were treated with oral biotin supplementation (n = 25). This case and review of the literature underscore that biotinidase deficiency should be considered in patients with bilateral and progressive optic neuropathy among young adults. Early diagnosis is important as biotin supplementation may halt and/or reverse the disease process."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Kelch ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1)-Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) axis is crucial for regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in acute pneumonia. Sphaeropsidin A (SA) is a antioxidant diterpenoid isolated from Sphaeropsis sapinea f. sp. cupressi, discovered as a novel Nrf2 agonist by our research group previously. However, the accurate function and mechanism of SA in treating acute pneumonia are still unknown. METHODS: The therapeutic effect of SA was evaluated in LPS-induced acute pneumonia in mice. The underlying mechanism of action was then analyzed by transcriptomics. The direct target of SA was identified through the synthesis of SA-biotin probe, and the binding amino acid residues were found and verified by LC-MS/MS analysis and site-specific mutation. Finally, knockout mice were employed to verify the mechanism of SA. RESULTS: Our data indicated that SA significantly inhibited LPS-induced acute pneumonia in mice via up-regulating Nrf2, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB activation, and identified Keap1 as the direct target of SA. Specifically, the effective dose of SA in mice was only 2 mg/kg. SA selectively covalent bound to Keap1 in cysteine 151 residue (Cys151). SA mediated the activation of Nrf2 and reduced the level of ROS, thereby inhibiting the NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Besides, SA formed hydrogen bond with ASP48 of ASC, blocking its oligomerization and inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that SA might be a new covalent molecule of Keap1 to activate Nrf2, and is a promising drug candidate or lead molecule for the therapy of acute pneumonia through regulating Nrf2/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome axis.",

      "abstract": "Unlike conventional detection, monitoring membrane characteristics of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) within a specific time frame can effectively indicate tumor progression, yet the challenge lies in selectively isolating CTCs generated during this period and precisely identifying subtle progression-related changes. This study focuses on CTCs newly generated during melanoma immunotherapy, utilizing a strategic combination of tumor-specific glycometabolic engineering, phenotypic protein-confined biotinylation and lanthanide luminescence to enrich and detect these spatiotemporally specific CTCs. First, Ac4ManNAz-associated cellular glycometabolic engineering selectively developes azide groups on the membranes of these CTCs, providing clickable artificial tags to distinguish them from pre-existing CTCs and blood cells. Subsequently, Fe3O4/lip-DBCO nanoparticles enrichs this CTC population through efficient click chemistry, achieving a capture efficiency exceeding 90 % for various types of CTCs, regardless of their phenotype, tumor type or species. Following this, a PD-L1-confined biotinylation is adopted to generate a significant number of biotin moieties in close proximity to the membrane PD-L1 of the captured CTCs, resulting in a 9-fold increase in the number of active sites available for introducing detection signal sources, compared to traditional immunofluorescent labeling methods. Further introduction of streptavidin-functionalized europium (Eu)-lanthanide nanoparticles (EuNPs-SA) quantifies the captured CTCs in a time-resolved manner and assesses CTC-related therapeutic response, while eliminating interferences from background biological substances. Specifically, significant advancements in detection performance have enabled the assessment of immunotherapeutic efficacy within melanoma model. Notably, substantial differences in lanthanide luminescent signals between the treated and untreated groups p = 0.000149), with the observed trends closely correlating with treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Theranostic nanosensitizers with combined near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and sono-photodynamic effects have great potential for use in the personalized treatment of deep-seated tumors. However, developing effective nanosensitizers for NIR fluorescence image-guided sono-photodynamic therapy remains a considerable challenge, including the low generation efficacy of reactive oxygen species (ROS), poor photostability, and the absence of cancer specificity. Herein, a novel heavy atom-free nanosensitizer is developed, which exhibits intense NIR fluorescence, high ROS generation efficiency, and improved aqueous stability. By conjugating a bulky and electron-rich group, 4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)-1,1'-biphenyl (TPE), to the IR820 backbone, the resulting IR820 bearing TPE (IR820-TPE) effectively generates ROS via type I and II photochemical mechanisms under 808 nm laser irradiation. Moreover, TPE conjugation considerably increases the sono-photodynamic performance of IR820. To improve the intracellular delivery and tumor-targeting ability of IR820-TPE, biotin-conjugated exosome (B-Exo) is used as a natural nanocarrier. In vitro studies demonstrate the outstanding therapeutic performance of IR820-TPE-loaded B-Exo (IR820-TPE@B-Exo) in synergistic sono-photodynamic cancer therapy. In vivo studies reveal that IR820-TPE@B-Exo shows enhanced tumor accumulation, strong fluorescence signals, and effective sono-photodynamic therapeutic activity with high biosafety. This work demonstrates that IR820-TPE@B-Exo is a promising sono-phototheranostic agent for safe and targeted cancer therapy and NIR fluorescence imaging."

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a rapidly increasing metabolic disorder that poses a significant threat to global public health. Recent evidence suggests that targeting the gut microbiota through dietary and pharmaceutical interventions can effectively manage T2DM. In this study, we developed a novel Chinese herbal formula, CCM, specifically for T2DM, composed of Coptis rhizoma, Cinnamomi cortex, and Mume fructus. To evaluate CCM's efficacy and explore its underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of the gut microbiota, diabetic C57/db/db mice were administered different doses of CCM (low, medium, high) for 4 weeks, with normal C57 mice as healthy controls and metformin as a positive control. Comprehensive clinical indicators of T2DM were measured before and after treatment. High-throughput sequencing was used to assess changes in gut microbiome composition and function. Our results showed that CCM treatment, especially at medium and high doses, resulted in more significant improvements in blood glucose, lipid profiles, and body weight compared to metformin. The CCM-treated group also exhibited more significant changes in the microbial community structure compared to the metformin group, notably enriching three beneficial microbes (>40%): Bacteroidetes spp., Akkermansia spp., and Parabacteroides spp., which correlated with improved diabetic parameters. Further analysis identified that all four microbial metabolic pathways linked to lowering blood glucose were exclusively enriched in the CCM-treated group. Of the 10 pathways related to improved blood lipid levels, five were unique to CCM. These unique pathways enriched by CCM may explain its superior therapeutic effects, indicating its distinct mechanisms in modulating gut microbiota.IMPORTANCEOur study demonstrates that CCM outperforms metformin in managing key clinical indicators in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model mice and induces more significant alterations in gut microbiota composition and function. Notably, the uniquely enriched beneficial microbes and microbial metabolic pathways in the CCM samples may explain its enhanced therapeutic effects compared to metformin. Consequently, these findings suggest that CCM offers a promising therapeutic strategy for T2DM, and further provide valuable insights into potential probiotic candidates (such as Bacteroidetes spp., Akkermansia spp., and Parabacteroides spp.) and newly identified functional pathways (such as chondroitin sulfate degradation, geraniol degradation, biotin biosynthesis, colonic acid building blocks biosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics) that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder of the nervous system characterized by a deficiency in interpersonal communication skills, a pathologic tendency for repetitive behaviors, and highly restrictive interests. The spectrum is a gradient-based construct used to categorize the widely varying degrees of ASD phenotypes, and has been linked to a genetic etiology in 25% of cases. Prior studies have revealed that 30% of ASD patients exhibit hyperserotonemia, or elevated whole blood serotonin, implicating the serotonergic system in the pathogenesis of ASD. Likewise, escitalopram, a selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been demonstrated to improve aberrant behavior and irritability in ASD patients, potentially by modulating abnormal brain activation. Prior studies have uncovered proband patients with rare mutations in the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) that manifest enhanced surface expression and transport capacity, suggesting that abnormal enhancement of hSERT function may be involved in the pathogenesis of ASD. METHODS: HEK-293 cells stably expressing WT, C109A, I425L, F465L, L550V, or K605N hSERT were subject to analysis for palmitoylation via Acyl-Biotin Exchange followed with hSERT immunoblotting. F465L functional enhancement was confirmed by surface analysis via biotinylation and saturation analysis via 5HT transport. F465L palmitoylation, surface expression and transport capacity were then assessed following treatment with 2-bromopalmitate or escitalopram. RESULTS: Here, we reveal that palmitoylation is enhanced in the ASD hSERT F465L and L550V coding variants, and confirm prior reports of enhanced kinetic activity and surface expression of F465L. Subsequently, treatment of F465L with the irreversible palmitoyl acyl-transferase inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate (2BP), or escitalopram, rectified enhanced F465L palmitoylation, surface expression, and transport capacity to basal WT levels. LIMITATIONS: Tests assessing L550V for surface expression, transport capacity, and reactivity to inhibition of palmitoylation was not assessed. In addition, further characterization is necessary for internalization rates, degradative mechanisms, the impact of cysteine-mediated substitutions, and other SSRIs on these processes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results implicate disordered hSERT palmitoylation in the pathogenesis of serotonergic ASD subtypes, with basal recovery of these processes following escitalopram providing insight into its molecular utility as an ASD therapeutic."

      "abstract": "The treatment outcomes of chemotherapy are far from satisfactory due to suboptimal cellular uptake and inadequate intracellular release of antitumor drugs. Meanwhile, M2-like tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment promote cancer growth and metastasis. The combined strategy of chemotherapy and reprogramming M2-like TAMs within tumor microenvironment has emerged as a novel paradigm for cancer therapy. Hence, a pH-sensitive double-targeted inclusion complex was constructed for combined cancer therapy through the controlled paclitaxel (PTX) delivery and re-education of M2-like TAMs. The inclusion complex employed arginine and biotin modified hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Arg-CD-Bio) as the host, with benzimidazole and mannose modified hyaluronic acid (BM-HA-Man) as the pH-sensitive plug. PTX was encapsulated in the inclusion complex. In vitro experiments indicated that the Arg-CD-Bio/BM-HA-Man inclusion complex could facilitate the specific release of PTX at the tumor site. The inclusion complex could be effectively internalized by M2-like TAMs and MCF-7 cells and further reprogramme M2-like TAMs to M1-like TAMs. In vivo antitumor therapy in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice had achieved remarkable suppression efficacy. These results suggested that the PTX-loaded Arg-CD-Bio/BM-HA-Man inclusion complex was a promising platform for efficient cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Developing targeted therapeutic drugs for liver cancer remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Previous research by the authors showed that taraxasterol (TS) can enhance the antitumor immune response of T-lymphocytes, inhibiting the growth of liver cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. To improve the targeting ability and efficacy of TS, the authors synthesized a novel compound, Bio-SS-TS, which utilizes the high expression of biotin receptors on tumor cell membranes to link biotin to TS for increased targeting to hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and its disulfide bond can be specifically hydrolyzed by high - level glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells to release the active component TS. In vitro, Bio-SS-TS reduced liver cancer cell (HepG2 and Huh7) proliferation, impaired mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased intracellular GSH content in tumor cells, increased the reactive oxygen species level, and promoted the release of cytochrome c. Endogenous GSH in cancer cells reduced the disulfide bond in Bio-SS-TS, releasing active TS components. In vivo, treatment with Bio-SS-TS caused no significant change in mouse body weight and no toxicity to the main organs. The present study comprehensively demonstrates that Bio-SS-TS exerts a potent anti - liver cancer effect by enhancing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, which may provide a new candidate for targeted liver cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "Drug resistance is a significant challenge for tumor therapy. Activating immunity is an effective method to combat drug-resistant tumors. Utilizing metallic chemotherapeutic agents to induce nonapoptotic programmed cell death is a practical approach to stimulate immunity. Besides, triggering tumor cell senescence, named senotherapy, is also an effective but often ignored method to induce immune responses. Despite some progress, reports on metallic immunotherapeutic stimuli are sparse and mainly delve into the level of organelle targeting, with vague drug-target mechanisms. Here, we report a Ru(II) complex (Ru2c) inhibits BRD4 with high affinity at a nanomolar constant. After encapsulation into biotin-DNA cage, Ru2c@biotin-DNA cage was demonstrated to kill drug-resistant cancer cells through a synergistic apoptosis-ferroptosis-senescence pathway, exhibiting 51-fold anticancer activity compared to the commercial inhibitor JQ-1. Ru2c effectively erased drug-resistant tumors and activated innate and acquired immunity in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, Ru2c is the first metal-based BRD4 inhibitor to achieve synergistic seno-immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy."

The abnormally activated fibroblasts after scar maturation are the chief culprit. Single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse cardiac interstitial cells after myocardial infarction depicts a late-activated fibroblast subpopulation F-Act and initially identifies its characteristic antigen CD248, which is also verified in human hearts. On this basis, we develop a CD248-targeted biotin-binding immune receptor T cell therapy against F-Act to correct cardiac repair disorders. In our study, the precise removal of F-Act after the scar matured effectively inhibits fibrotic expansion in the peri-infarct zone and improves cardiac function.

The resulting conjugate (FA-SS-Bio) was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and exhibited an amorphous structure, in contrast to the crystalline nature of FA. FA-SS-Bio demonstrated accelerated drug release under reductive and oxidative conditions. Biotinylation significantly increased cell uptake of the drug in biotin receptor (BR)-positive HeLa and MCF-7 cells, as confirmed by cellular uptake studies and molecular docking, which revealed strong biotin-BR interactions. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of FA-SS-Bio was significantly improved, with IC50 values that were 2.94-fold and 2.95-fold lower than those of free FA against HeLa and MCF-7 cells, respectively. BR blockade with biotin reduced FA-SS-Bio cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner, confirming biotin-mediated targeting. Apoptosis assays showed enhanced FA-induced apoptosis due to biotin and disulfide bonds. FA-SS-Bio demonstrated excellent blood compatibility, with a hemolysis rate below 0.5 %, compared to ∼1.5 % for FA. Additionally, FA-SS-Bio exhibited higher cell viability in MCF-10 A cells than in cancer cells, highlighting its favorable safety profile. These findings provide a novel perspective on the design of prodrug conjugates for improved cancer therapy.",

In PDT, photosensitizers (PSs) are frequently administered directly but do not selectively target cancer cells. To address the delivery of a PS to TNBC and enhance cellular uptake, the Ru-NH2-modified avidin bioconjugate (RuAvi) via Tyr-specific modification using the Mannich reaction is prepared. The RuAvi is further assembled with the cinnamoyl peptide-F(D)LF(D)LFK-NH2 (FK), which binds to formyl peptide receptor 1, overexpressed in TNBC. Notably, the modified Avi still possesses the ability to efficiently bind biotin for the assembly of up to four copies of the FK peptides. The resultant FK4-RuAvi exhibited an IC50 value of 0.36 ± 0.08 µM, which is ≈3.5-fold lower than that of RuAvi (1.25 ± 0.09 µM), upon irradiation in the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. FK4-RuAvi also shows efficient uptake in MDA-MB-231 tumor spheroids and exhibited significant toxicity after irradiation compared to the control RuAvi. The presented strategy has the potential to improve the efficacy of targeted PDT to meet the high demand for targeted therapies to treat TNBC, such as targeted adjuvant treatment after breast cancer surgery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic skin ulcer is a clinical disorder of glucose metabolism that has a long treatment period and is prone to recurrent episodes. Huiyang Shengji decoction (HYSJD) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine for its clinical treatment, but its metabolic effects in patients with diabetic skin ulcers have not been well studied. PURPOSE: Our study aimed to investigate the mechanism of pharmacological treatment of HYSJD in treating diabetic skin ulcers. METHODS: The potential mechanism underlying diabetic wound treatment by HYSJD was screened using network pharmacology. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS metabolomics analysis and correlation analysis were performed to investigate potential target pathways and genes. Furthermore, the db/db diabetic wound tissues and RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation model verified the mechanism using molecular biology experiments. RESULTS: In network pharmacology, HYSJD played a mainly therapeutic effect by regulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, metabolic pathway, and other related metabolic-related pathways. Metabolomics analysis disclosed that L-lysine content increased, while those of linoleic and deoxycholic acids decreased in plasma between the HYSJD-treated group and the control group, participating in biotin metabolism. Among them, PPARγ played an important role. The experiments conducted in db/db mice indicated that HYSJD facilitates VEGF secretion and PPARγ expression. In vitro experiments have revealed that HYSJD inhibits macrophage ROS production, augments mitochondrial ATP production, elevates mitochondrial membrane potential, and diminishes the mitochondrial ECAR rate. Furthermore, these effects culminate in promoting M2 macrophage polarization through PPARγ activation. The molecular docking results revealed that the active compounds from HYSJD were capable of binding to PPARγ protein primarily through hydrogen bonding interactions. Notably, all binding energies were found to be lower than -3 kcal/mol, indicating strong and favorable interactions between the active compounds and the target receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that HYSJD regulates biotin metabolism by reducing excess levels of linoleic and deoxycholic acids and increasing levels of L-lysine, which in turn promotes diabetic wound healing by promoting M2 macrophage polarization through PPARγ up-regulation. These findings indicated that HYSJD is a decoction that can effectively treat diabetic skin ulcers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Artemetin, a natural flavonoid, is well-known for its significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, but its mechanisms in asthma are still unclear. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the therapeutic potential of Artemetin in mitigating airway inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction via ABCG2/RAB7A signaling pathway. METHODS: An HDM-induced mouse asthma model and HDM-treated BEAS-2B cell model were established, methods utilized included bioinformatics, molecular docking, Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS), and Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA), flow cytometry, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Artemetin significantly alleviates the proportion of eosinophils and pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF, IgE levels in serum, airway epithelial mucus secretion, inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen fiber deposition. ABCG2 was identified as a core binding target of Artemetin. When Artemetin was labeled with Biotin, further experiments confirmed its interaction and upregulation of ABCG2. Overexpression of ABCG2 (OV-ABCG2) enhances antioxidant capacity by upregulating Nrf2, HO-1, SOD and CAT, mitigating mitochondrial oxidative stress (mtROS), improving mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reducing DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission while enhancing MFN2-mediated fusion. Furthermore, ABCG2 was found to interact with and downregulate RAB7A. Both Artemetin and siRNA-RAB7A notably inhibit p-DRP1 and mitochondrial translocation of DRP1, thereby promoting mitochondrial fusion, reducing mtROS and increasing MMP. KEGG pathway enrichment revealed that ABCG2 is closely linked to apoptosis. Artemetin, OV-ABCG2, and RAB7A knockdown all alleviated HDM-induced PANoptosis by decreasing ZBP1, GSDMD, Caspase-8, FADD, BAX and RIPK1 while increasing anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: Artemetin significantly improves airway inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in asthma by modulating the ABCG2/RAB7A axis and PANoptosis. Artemetin presents new possibilities for adjunctive therapy in the management of asthma.",

These vitamins include B1 (Thiamine), B2 (Riboflavin), B3 (Niacin), B5 (Pantothenic Acid), B6 (Pyridoxine), B7 (Biotin), B9 (Folate), and B12 (Cobalamin). Recent studies have shown that besides their fundamental physiological roles, B vitamins influence oncogenic metabolic pathways, including glycolysis (Warburg effect), mitochondrial function, and nucleotide biosynthesis. Although deficiencies in these vitamins are associated with several complications, emerging evidence suggests that excessive intake of specific B vitamins may also contribute to cancer progression and interfere with therapy due to impaired metabolic and genetic functions. This review discusses the tumor-suppressive and tumor-progressive roles of B vitamins in cancer. It also explores the recent evidence on a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between B vitamin metabolism and cancer progression and underscores the need for further research to determine the optimal balance of B vitamin intake for cancer prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "The interdependence between microalgae and bacteria has sparked scientific interest over years, primarily driven by the practical applications of microalgal-bacteria consortia in wastewater treatment and algal biofuel production. Although adequate studies have focused on the broad interactions and general behavior between the two entities, there remains a scarcity of study on the metabolic role of symbiotic bacteria in promoting microalgal growth. Here, we use the KEIO Knockout Collection, an Escherichia coli gene knockout mutant library, to systematically screen for genes involved in the interdependence of Chlorella sorokiniana and E. coli. By co-cultivating C. sorokiniana and E. coli knockout mutants in 96-well microplates (200 μL medium per well) under white light at 25°C, 31 potential algal growth-promoting and 56 growth-inhibiting genes out of 3985 genes were identified that enhanced (≥1.25-fold) and diminished (≤0.8-fold) the production of algal chlorophyll-a content, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping of these growth-regulating genes suggested a metabolic symbiosis involving bacteria-derived cobalamin (cobU, cobC), biotin (bioB, bioF, bioC, bioD, fabF, fabH), riboflavin (fbp, guaB, gnd, guaA, zwf, purA), and 2,3-butanediol (fumB, adhE, mdh, frdB, pta, sdhC). The effects of these metabolites were further validated by supplementing the agents into the axenic algal cultures; Dose-dependent trends were observed for each metabolite, with a maximum four-fold increase in algal biomass productivity over the control. The specific growth rate of algae was increased by ≥1.27-fold and doubling time was shortened by ≥22.5%. The present results, obtained through genome-wide analyses of interdependence between microalgae and bacteria, reveals multiple interactions between organisms via metabolites."

      "abstract": "Frequent degenerative joint diseases, known as arthritis, are characterized by joint inflammation and cartilage breakdown. Various arthritis types are traditionally managed with intraarticular injections of hyaluronan or its derivatives. However, intravenous administration of hyaluronan is emerging as a vital alternative, particularly because intraarticular injections can be challenging for clinicians when targeting small or swollen joints. Pharmacokinetics of intravenously and intraperitoneally administered middle-Mw hyaluronan were studied in an adjuvant-induced arthritis mouse model alongside therapeutic effects. Using 13C-, biotin- and fluoresce-labeling, we found hyaluronan accumulated in inflamed joint tissues while distribution in other organs remained similar to healthy controls. Repeated administrations significantly reduced arthritis symptoms like swelling and redness, RANKL, inducible nitric oxide synthase, COMP and prostaglandin E2 levels. Moreover, hyaluronan treatment prevented dextran-FITC penetration into inflamed paws suggesting reduced vascular permeability at the site of inflammation. These findings support systemic hyaluronan administration as a promising arthritis treatment strategy."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was the primary causative factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the existing therapy drugs for oxidative stress were much less investigated, which underlined the necessity for new drug discovery and development. Herein, we aimed to synthesize several novel idebenone (IDE) derivatives and investigate the protective effect and mechanism of these derivatives against H2O2-induced oxidative stress injury in H9C2 cells by determining cell proliferation rate, detecting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and the expression of related proteins. Additionally, the study also investigated the protective effect of IDE-1 pretreatment on Balb/c mice after hypoxia-reoxygenation. In vivo experiments, the damage to cardiomyocytes was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The results showed that IDE-1 possessed the highest antioxidant damage activity among all IDE derivatives, which could notably decrease the levels of intracellular ROS. Furthermore, the antioxidant mechanism was confirmed to be potentially linked to the expression levels of the oxidation-related pathway heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the apoptosis-related pathway Bcl-2/Bax and caspase-3. Our results demonstrated that IDE derivatives could be a new research direction for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with oxidative stress."

The cohort comprised 61 children diagnosed with BD who were followed at the Department of Pediatric Metabolism of Başakşehir Çam and Sakura City Hospital in Istanbul, along with their parents. The control group comprised 49 children who were admitted to the pediatric outpatient clinic during the same period and did not have any chronic physical diseases or previous psychiatric admissions, and their parents. The current findings indicated that children with BD did not show significant developmental delays compared to the control group, with no notable differences in intelligence scores between the groups. Interestingly, parents of children with BD reported lower levels of state anxiety than those of the control group, although no significant differences were observed for other mental health metrics. CONCLUSION:  These findings imply that early diagnosis and intervention through newborn screening could help alleviate developmental and psychological challenges for children and their parents. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Children who receive biotin supplementation before the onset of symptoms generally develop, while those who are untreated may exhibit developmental delays. • Having a child with a metabolic disease can adversely affect a parent's psychological well-being. WHAT IS NEW: • Children diagnosed with BD through newborn screening did not show significant developmental delays compared to the control group, with no notable differences in intelligence scores between the groups. • Parents of children with BD reported lower levels of state anxiety than those of the control group, although no significant differences were observed for other mental health metrics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a characteristic feature of numerous cardiovascular diseases and significantly impacts human health. However, effective treatment options for cardiac hypertrophy are still significantly unmet. Pedunculoside, a pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin from the traditional Chinese herb Ilex rotunda Thunb., exhibits various pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular therapeutic effects, but its anti-hypertrophy efficacy and mechanisms have not yet been reported. PURPOSE: This study aimed to confirm the ameliorating effect of pedunculoside on cardiac hypertrophy and elucidate its underlying mechanism. METHODS: To investigate the effect of pedunculoside on cardiac hypertrophy, we used transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO) infusion to induce cardiac hypertrophy model in mice. Angiotensin II (Ang II) was used to mimic hypertrophy model in myocardial cells. Then, we utilized a biotin-tagged carabrone chemical probe and validation experiments to pinpoint pedunculoside's key targets. Further, molecular docking study and sites mutation were used to predict and identify the binding modes of pedunculoside to target. Finally, structural optimization was carried out to find new pedunculoside derivatives with stronger anti-hypertrophy activity and binding affinity to the target. RESULTS: Our findings revealed for the first time that pedunculoside treatment significantly attenuated hypertrophic phenotypes in response to TAC and ISO. It also effectively reduced hypertrophy and fibrosis in myocardial cells exposed to Ang II stimulation. Mechanically, we identified transcription factor GATA-6 (GATA6) as a key target of pedunculoside for treating cardiac hypertrophy. Further studies demonstrated that pedunculoside blocks cardiac hypertrophy progression by inhibiting the transcriptional activation of GATA6 on promoting fetal gene expression. More importantly, a new pedunculoside derivative PE-3 with stronger anti-hypertrophy activity and affinity for GATA6 was discovered. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that pedunculoside and PE-3 could be developed as promising drug candidates for cardiac hypertrophy treatment.",

The mutation spectrum is known to correlate with clinical phenotypes and responsiveness to biotin therapy. Five patients diagnosed with HLCS deficiency between 2015 and 2024 were recruited. Their medical records were retrospectively analyzed for clinical, laboratory, and molecular data. The diagnosis was confirmed through urine organic acid analysis, acylcarnitine profiling of blood spots, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). All patients had skin rashes, either preceding metabolic decompensation or during follow-up. Four patients presented in a decompensated state with respiratory distress (100%, 4/4), seizures (50%, 2/4), metabolic acidosis (100%, 4/4), and encephalopathy (100%, 4/4). Most patients (4/5) had late-onset presentations and responded well to biotin. One patient died before treatment could be given. Of the four who survived, biotin doses of 10-30 mg daily maintained metabolic stability. The oldest patient, now 30 years old, was able to have two successful pregnancies with biotin dose adjustments. Molecular analysis identified 4 mutations: of these, c.1522C>T (p.Arg508Trp) is a known recurrent biotin-responsive mutation, accounting for 50% of mutant alleles. The c.271del variant had not been previously reported in the literature. This is the first report of HLCS deficiency in a Malaysian population, highlighting the c.1522C>T (p.Arg508Trp) variant as a target for rapid molecular screening. Most patients in this cohort have good outcomes from biotin supplementation, emphasizing the need for early intervention to prevent irreversible neurological damage."

      "abstract": "It is highly desired to achieve Type-I photosensitizer (PS) to overcome the hypoxic limitation found in most clinically used PSs. Herein, a new heavy-atom-free Type-I PS T-BNCy5 is presented by incorporating a biotin-modified naphthalimide (NI) unit into the meso-position of a N-benzyl-functionalized, strongly photon-capturing pentamethine cyanine (Cy5) dye. Such molecular engineering induces a rigid orthogonal geometry between NI and Cy5 units by introducing an intramolecular sandwich-like π-π stacking assembly, which effectively promotes intersystem crossing (ISC) and greatly extends the triplet-state lifetime (τ = 389 µs), thereby markedly improving the superoxide (O2 •-)-generating ability. In vitro assays reveal that T-BNCy5 specifically accumulates in mitochondria, where it not only generates O2 •- under photoirradiation but also induces the burst of the most cytotoxic hydroxy radical (HO•) by a cascade of biochemical reactions, ultimately triggering cell ferroptosis with the IC50 value up to ≈0.45 µm whether under normoxia or hypoxia. In vivo assays manifest that, benefiting from its biotin unit, T-BNCy5 displays a strong tumor-targeting ability, and after a single PDT treatment, it can not only ablate the tumor almost completely but also be cleared from the body through biosafe urinary excretion, indicating its potential for future clinical translation."

Methods: We synthesized DOTAP-PLGA hybrid nanoparticles loaded with DCX and functionalized them with Chi-Tn mAb through a biotin-avidin approach. The physicochemical characterization involved dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The in vitro and in vivo evaluations encompassed uptake studies, cell viability tests, and the assessment of tumor growth control in a lung cancer model. Results: The nanoparticles featured a hydrophobic PLGA core with 99.9% DCX encapsulation efficiency, surrounded by a DOTAP lipid shell ensuring colloidal stability with a high positive surface charge. The incorporation of PEGylated lipids on their surface helps evade the immune system and facilitate Chi-Tn mAb attachment. The resulting nanoparticles exhibit a spherical shape with monodisperse particle sizes averaging 250 nm, and demonstrate sustained drug release. In vitro uptake studies and viability assays conducted in A549 cancer cells show that the Chi-Tn mAb enhances nanoparticle internalization and significantly reduces cell viability. In vivo studies demonstrate a notable reduction in tumor volume and an increased survival rate in the A549 tumor xenograft mice model when DCX was encapsulated in nanoparticles and targeted with Chi-Tn mAb in comparison to the free drug. Conclusions: Therefore, Chi-Tn-functionalized LPHNps hold promise as carriers for actively targeting DCX to Tn-expressing carcinomas."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells as a model of normal cells in biotin-mediated therapy. The expression and role of sodium multivitamin transporter (SMVT) in the uptake and accumulation of free biotin, as well as cationic and neutral biotinylated PAMAM dendrimers of the fourth generation synthesized in our laboratory, were assessed in HEK293 cells in comparison to other immortalized (HaCaT) and cancer cells (HepG2, U-118 MG). The obtained data showed that a higher level of SMVT in HEK293 cells was not associated with a stronger uptake of biotin and biotinylated PAMAM dendrimers. Biotinylation increased the selective uptake of neutral dendrimers in an inversely proportional manner to the concentration used; however, the accumulation in HEK293 cells was lower than that in cells of other cell lines. The time-dependent biotin and biotinylated dendrimers uptake profiles differed significantly. Therefore, it should be assumed that the efficiency of biotinylated nanoparticles' uptake depends on multiple cellular transport mechanisms. Toxicity tests showed significantly higher sensitivity to PAMAM conjugates for HEK293 cells than for HepG2 and HaCaT cells. Molecular modeling studies and the profile of biotin uptake suggest that not only SMVT but also monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) may play an important role in the selective transport of biotin and biotinylated nanoparticles into cells. Due to the complexity of the problem, further studies are necessary. In summary, HEK293 cells can be considered a valuable model of normal cells in the study of biotin- targeted therapy using nanoparticles based on PAMAM dendrimers.",

The objective of this study was to determine the nutritional status, nutritional intake, and dietary quality among children aged 2 to 14 with CF. We aimed to assess the impact of a nutrition education intervention provided to mothers on these parameters and compare the results with a control group. METHODS: Participants (n = 46) were divided into two groups, one group received nutrition education, the other group did not receive any intervention, and all participants were followed up in the 1st and 3rd months of the study. Each participant completed a questionnaire form prepared by the researcher including general information about the patient, anthropometric data, 3-day dietary intake, and Mediterranean Diet Quality Index. RESULTS: While the children's Mediterranean Diet Quality Index scores did not change significantly during the study period, the proportion of children in the education group who had adequate nutrition according to body mass index percentile for age increased from 42.0% to 48.0%. In addition, energy (kcal), fat (g), and monounsaturated fatty acids (g) intake, vitamin D, E, K, B6, biotin, and iron intakes of the education group increased significantly during the study (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the literature by showing that nutrition education given to mothers for CF children, improves the nutritional status of children and increases their energy and nutrient intakes.",

In this work, gold nanoparticles-toluidine blue-graphene oxide (AuNPs-TB-GO) and gold nanoparticles-carboxyl ferrocene-tungsten disulfide (AuNPs-FMC-WS2) nanocomposites were prepared for labeling Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody and Carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA72-4) antibody, respectively, and used as two kinds of probes with different electrochemical signals. With the excellent magnetic performance of biotin immune magnetic beads (IMBs), the biofunctional IMBs were firmly deposited on the magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE) surface by applying a constant magnetic field, and then the CEA and CA72-4 antibody were immobilized on the IMBs by the avidin-biotin conjugation. The assay was based on the change in the detection peak current. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the linear range of detection of CEA is of the two-component immunosensor is from 0.01 to 120 ng/mL, with a low detection limit of 0.003 ng/mL, and the linear range of detection of CA72-4 is from 0.05 to 35 U/mL, with a detection limit of 0.016 U/mL. The results showed that the proposed immunosensor enabled simultaneous monitoring of CEA and CA72-4 and exhibited good reproducibility, excellent high selectivity, and sensitivity. In particular, the proposed multiplexed immunoassay approach does not require sophisticated fabrication and is well-suited for high-throughput biosensing and application to other areas.",

      "abstract": "Targeting cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), as chimeric antigen T cells (CAR-T), T cell receptor-engineered (TCR)-T cells or adoptive cell transfer of tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) to solid tumors is a major therapeutic challenge. We describe a new strategy to confer these lymphocytes with de novo adhesiveness to surface proteins enriched in the tumor microenvironment. This approach is based on decorating CTLs with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to any surface protein of interest within the stroma and the extracelullar matrix of solid tumors. For efficient mAb decoration, we have introduced a mAb binding Fc receptor (FcR) scaffold, FcγRIIB1 (CD32B1), which we found to be enriched on B lymphocyte microvilli (MV). This isoform contains an inhibitory ITIM motif within a cytoplasmic tail anchored to the cortical cytoskeleton. We thus generated a non-signaling CD32B1 mutant lacking the ITIM motif (termed ITIM-less CD32B1, or ILCD32B1) and successfully expressed it in human T cells which normally do not express this FcR. The ILCD32B1 expressing lymphocytes bound multiple IgG1 mAbs whose Fc domain was engineered with a 5-residue substitution to reach a nM range of Fc-FcγCR dissociation constants. The mAb decorated ILCD32B1 expressing T cells could readily adhere to a surface-bound cognate antigen. To broaden the utility of this scaffold, we have also generated a new fusion protein in which the entire Fc binding domain was truncated (tILCD32B1) and replaced with a monomeric streptavidin variant, mSA2, via a CD8 hinge. The molecule, termed mSA2-CD8h-tILCD32B1, was also successfully expressed in T cells, readily and stably bound biotinylated IgG mAbs in vitro and once decorated with the biotin labeled mAbs, conferred the T cells with high adhesiveness to multiple surface-coated antigens. mSA2-CD8h-tILCD32B1 expressing human T cells decorated ex vivo with a biotin-labeled mAb retained the antibody for hours after accumulation inside breast tumors implanted in immunodeficient recipient mice. Our results collectively suggest that a non-signaling CD32B1 can be used as a versatile scaffold for mAb decoration of T cells. Our mAb decoration approach can confer new cell adhesive reactivities to improve tumor CTL (CAR-T and TIL) accumulation and retention inside solid tumors.",

Lysine residues were modified using a phenyl isothiocyanate anchor, and tyrosine residues using either an aryl diazonium salt or a N-methyl luminol derivative. We demonstrate anchor-dependent labeling levels, as observed with biochemical assays and mass spectrometry. Strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) was then implemented and evaluated on the rAAV to append functionalities such as fluorescein, biotin, and carbohydrates to the azido-coated capsids. We confirmed the efficiency of the bioorthogonal reaction and observed a stronger reactivity with dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO) compared to bicyclononyne (BCN). The optimized SPAAC reaction was finally used to label the viral vectors with two relevant nanobodies targeting specific immune cell receptors (CD62L and CD45). In vitro transduction assays conducted with one rAAV-nanobody conjugate demonstrated the promising targeting properties of these chemically modified vectors. Thus, we anticipate that this strategy will positively impact the field of rAAV capsid engineering and contribute in tissue-specific targeting for the optimization of gene therapy treatments.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD) is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder characterized by diverse and variable phenotypic features, which can make diagnosis challenging. However, prompt treatment with thiamine and biotin can effectively manage the condition. Diagnosis relies on the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in the SLC19A3 gene. This case report describes two novel variants of uncertain significance in the SLC19A3 gene, which may be correlated with the phenotypic manifestations of BTBGD. CASE PRESENTATION: Our case is a 7-month-old female infant who presented with a 3-week history of irritability, altered behavior, and refusal of newly introduced solid foods. Symptoms started with an upper respiratory tract infection, followed by lethargy, floppiness, and abnormal movements. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ward with a broad differential diagnosis. Extensive laboratory evaluations revealed lactic acidosis. MRI brain showed symmetric restricted diffusion affecting the bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, and cortical regions. Whole genome sequencing identified biallelic variants of the SLC19A3: a c.1364T>G p.Met455Arg missense variant in the maternal allele and a 2.3 kb deletion of intron 3 of the paternal allele. Both variants were identified as variants of uncertain significance. However, given the clinical picture, MRI brain findings, resolution of symptoms with empiric biotin and thiamine supplementation, and biallelic SLC19A3 variants of unknown significance, the patient most likely suffers from BTBGD. Patient continues to show sustained developmental progress on biotin and thiamine supplementation. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the fact that genetic testing remains a vital but improvable tool for the diagnosis of BTBGD. As of yet, genetic testing and diagnosis of BTBGD continues to be limited by the knowledge of which SLC19A3 variants are established to be pathogenic variants. Thus, further research is required to study other SCL19A3 variants of unknown significance to further improve genetic testing and diagnosis of BTBGD in the future."

      "abstract": "The Escherichia coli surfaceome consists mainly of the large surface organelles expressed by the organism to navigate and interact with the surrounding environment. The current study focuses on type I fimbriae and flagella. These large polymeric surface organelles are composed of hundreds to thousands of subunits, with their large size often preventing them from being studied in their native form. Recent studies are accumulating which demonstrate the glycosylation of surface proteins or virulence factors in pathogens, including E. coli. Using biochemical and glycobiological techniques, including biotin-hydrazide labeling of glycans and chemical and glycosidase treatments, we demonstrate (i) the presence of a well-defined and chemically resistant FimA oligomer in several strains of pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli, (ii) the major subunit of type I fimbriae, FimA, in pathogenic and laboratory strains is recognized by concanavalin A, (iii) standard methods to remove N-glycans (PNGase F) or a broad-specificity mannosidase fail to remove the glycan structure, despite the treatments resulting in altered migration in SDS-PAGE, (iv) PNGase F treatment results in a novel 32 kDa band recognized by anti-FliC antiserum. While the exact identity of the glycan(s) and their site of attachment currently elude detection by conventional glycomics/glycoproteomics, the current findings highlight a potential additional layer of complexity of the surface (glyco) proteome of the commensal or adhesive and invasive E. coli strains studied."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The specificity of the ubiquitination process is mediated by the E3 ligases. Discriminating genuine substrates of E3s from mere interacting proteins is one of the major challenges in the field. We previously developed BioE3, a biotin-based approach that uses BirA-E3 fusions together with ubiquitin fused to a low-affinity AviTag to obtain a site-specific and proximity-dependent biotinylation of the substrates. We proved the suitability of BioE3 to identify targets of RING and HECT-type E3 ligases. METHODS: BioE3 experiments were performed in HEK293FT and U2OS stable cell lines expressing TRIPZ-bioGEFUb transiently transfected with BirA-cereblon (CRBN). Cells were seeded using biotin-free media, followed later by a short-biotin pulse. We evaluated the applicability of the BioE3 system to CRBN and molecular glues by Western blot and confocal microscopy, blocking the proteasome with bortezomib, inhibiting NEDDylation with MLN4924 and treating the cells with pomalidomide. For the identification of endogenous substrates and neosubstrates we analyzed the eluates of streptavidin pull-downs of BioE3 experiments by LC-MS/MS. Analysis of targets for which ubiquitination changes significantly upon treatment was done using two-sided Student's t-test. Orthogonal validations were performed by histidine pull-down, GFP-trap and computational modelling. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that BioE3 is suitable for the multi-protein complex Cullin-RING E3s ligases (CRLs), the most utilized E3-type for targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies. Using CRBN as proof of concept, one of the substrate receptors of CRL4 E3 ligase, we identified both endogenous substrates and novel neosubstrates upon pomalidomide treatment, including CSDE1 which contains a G-loop motif potentially involved in the binding to CRBN in presence of pomalidomide. Importantly, we observed a major rearrangement of the endogenous ubiquitination landscape upon treatment with this molecular glue. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of BioE3 to detect and compare both substrates and neosubstrates, as well as how substrates change in response to treatments, will facilitate both on-target and off-target identifications and offer a broader characterization and validation of TPD compounds, like molecular glues and PROTACs.",

      "abstract": "The growing demand for minimally processed foods has promoted the application of non-thermal sterilization technologies, such as intense pulsed light (IPL), to ensure food safety while preserving nutritional and sensory attributes. However, the potential for sublethal bacterial recovery after IPL treatment remains a major concern. In this study, IPL showed varying bactericidal capacities for Staphylococcus aureus in water and pork surfaces, respectively reducing by approximately 4 and 1.2 log CFU/mL after 2 applications at 4 cm, despite similar damage was observed by SEM. The differences in sterilization were speculated that sublethal S. aureus cells caused by IPL could be recovered within a nutritive environment such as pork. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, intracellular redox enzyme activities and transcriptomic responses of sublethal S. aureus were analyzed. The results indicate that S. aureus repaired the damage caused by IPL mainly through three ways. Firstly, DNA damage was repaired by activating SOS response, restoring DNA double-strand breaks, and improving purine metabolism. Besides, S. aureus responded to oxidative damage by maintaining iron homeostasis, synthesizing biotin and clearing aldehyde metabolites. Meanwhile, amino acids, phosphate and ferric ions served as substrates and ATP for cell repair by amino acid metabolism. In conclusion, this study analyzed the recovery mechanism of sublethal S. aureus under IPL stimulus, and provides new insights for controlling pathogenic bacteria in minimally processed food industry.",

Preclinical and clinical studies investigating the effects of curcumin on TBI indicate that curcumin can modulate essential signaling pathways and molecules that mediate neuroinflammation in TBI. This study aimed to explore the effects of turmeric on neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorder following repetitive traumatic brain injuries (rTBIs) in a rat model. METHODS: Sixty male Rattus norvegicus were housed in a controlled environment. A modified Marmarou weight drop model was used. Turmeric extract was administered once daily in the morning. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique was used to evaluate the expression of all markers. Following incubation with normal rabbit serum, the slides were subsequently incubated with monoclonal antibodies targeting tau protein (AT-8), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. RESULTS: rTBI significantly increased the levels of inflammatory markers, such as TNF-α and GFAP. A substantial decrease of TNF-α expression was observed in the treatment group. A distinct trend was observed for GFAP expression, which was markedly decreased after the rest period compared to that in the trauma group. Phosphorylated tau expression decreased in both the treatment and pretreatment groups relative to that in the trauma and rest groups. TDP-43 expression was also significantly decreased in the treatment and pretreatment groups. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Turmeric demonstrates significant potential as a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agent in rTBI, especially when used as a preventive measure. Our findings challenge the significance of rest in concussion management."

      "abstract": "Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is a tropical fruit used in chocolate production, with a huge portion of its byproducts, such as cocoa honey, being discarded, contributing to the over 52,000 tons of waste generated by the cocoa chain. Cocoa honey is a yellow liquid that drips from cocoa beans, rich in sugars, organic acids, vitamins, and minerals, making it highly susceptible to microbial fermentation. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of cocoa honey's integrated profile, evaluating its antioxidant properties, bioactive compounds, vitamins, minerals, microbiological conditions, and physicochemical characteristics, while integrating a discussion on its potential food-related applications. Advanced analytical techniques, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS), and thermal analysis methods (differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry, DSC/TGA), were employed to identify bioactive and nutritional compounds in this by-product and explore correlations between different identification instruments. The analytical techniques, combined with physicochemical analysis, revealed a sugar content of 17.68 g 100 mL-1, with fructose (4.65 g 100 mL-1) and glucose (4.19 g 100 mL-1) as the predominant sugars. Additionally, it is rich in essential minerals, including potassium (157.1 mg L-1) and magnesium (213.0 mg L-1), with the latter providing half of the recommended daily intake for an adult. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) identified trace amounts of essential amino acids, such as leucine and threonine, along with vitamins like biotin (0.16 mg 100 mL-1), findings further confirmed by HPLC. The structural profile of cocoa honey demonstrated a complex matrix comprising amino acids and fermentative metabolites, including methylamine, ethanol, and lactic acid. GC-MS analysis of volatile compounds revealed key substances, including alcohols and esters, which contribute to cocoa honey's distinctive fruity and floral aroma. Cocoa honey exhibited notable antioxidant activity, with a phenolic content of 251 mg GAE 100 mL-1 and flavonoids at 172.41 mg CE 100 mL-1. This contributed to its antioxidant capacity, as determined by DPPH (312.96 µmol TE 100 mL-1), with results corroborated by other methods such as FRAP and ABTS+. Comparisons highlighted its antioxidant potential relative to other tropical fruit pulps. To ensure stability and prevent microbial spoilage, stabilization treatment temperatures below 75.9 °C were identified as optimal for pathogen elimination while preserving the structural integrity of the honey. In conclusion, cocoa honey exhibits a distinctive composition, antioxidant properties, and both nutritional and physicochemical characteristics, suggesting its potential for various applications in the food industry. These characteristics make it a candidate for use as a functional ingredient in fermented products, as well as a natural flavoring or sweetening agent. Further research is necessary to optimize stabilization methods and evaluate its broader applications in food production.",

      "abstract": "l-Amino acid oxidases (LAAO) deaminate amino acids to α-keto acids and generate hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) with potential value for cancer therapy. We recombinantly expressed the LAAO from Aplysia punctata, called APIT (Cuvier 1803). The resulting wild-type APIT (APITwt) was conjugated to polyethylene glycol (APIT-PEG). Furthermore, an APIT mutant with an affibody targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; zHER2-APIT) was genetically engineered resulting in a binding affinity KD of ∼ 2.2 nM to the HER2 receptor ectodomain. Further, we evaluated if the APIT and tumor-targeted APIT can be used as an APIT-drug conjugate by covalently amidating the lysine residues on the protein surface. However, for the HER2-targeted APIT, the affibody contains lysines as well, and amidation of these lysines could have impaired the affibody's affinity to the HER2 receptor. Therefore, we designed a lysine-free variant of the tumor-targeting part of zHER2-APIT using an in silico mutation analysis, suggesting the replacement of the lysines of the affibody by arginine or alanine. This new variant is referred to as zHER2(K-del)-APIT. To simulate a covalent drug loading to APIT and the targeting constructs, we attached biotin by amidation. Biotin-zHER2(K-del)-APIT successfully allowed binding to HER2-positive but not HER2-negative cells in vitro. The biodistribution of these novel constructs was tested in xenografted mice with a HER2-positive and negative tumor in each animal. The zHER2(K-del)-APIT lost its ability to target HER2-positive tumors despite the in vitro data suggesting otherwise. The zHER2-APIT accumulated within the HER2-positive tumors but not in the negative tumors. APIT-PEG had increased uptake in HER2-positive and negative tumors compared to APITwt, which can be attributed to a prolonged serum half-life achieved by PEGylation, due to the absence of any tumor-targeting effect. These biodistribution studies point to HER2-targeting LAAOs for cancer therapy and PEGylation increasing tumor accumulation.",

Among NBIA subtypes, beta-propeller-protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is associated with mutations in the autophagy gene WDR45 (WD repeat domain 45). Previously, we demonstrated that WDR45 mutations in BPAN cellular models impaired autophagy, iron metabolism, and cell bioenergetics. In addition, antioxidant supplementation partially improved cell physiopathology; however, autophagy and cell bioenergetics remained affected. In this work, we explored the possibility of expressing the normal WDR45 allele present in the inactive chromosome X (Xi) of BPAN cells through treatment with epigenetic modulators. The aim of this study was to demonstrate whether biotin, an epigenetic nutrient, was able to restore the expression levels of WDR45 by a mechanism involving Xi reactivation and, consequently, correct BPAN defects. Our study demonstrated that biotin supplementation increases histone biotinylation and allows for the transcription of the WDR45 allele in Xi. Consequently, all physiopathological alterations in BPAN cells were notably corrected. The reactivation of Xi by epigenetic modulators can be a promising approach for the treatment of BPAN and other X-linked diseases.",

      "abstract": "Cuproptosis is a novel cell death dependent on mitochondrial respiration and regulated by copper. While the study of it is mainly focused on tumor therapy, in the present study, two key cuproptosis-related genes, ferredoxin (FDX1) and dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT) homologs (designated as CgFDX1 and CgDLAT), were identified from Crassostrea gigas. CgFDX1 has a Fer2 domain with a 2Fe-2S cluster forming a unique ferredoxin. CgDLAT is composed of a biotin_lipoyl domain, an E3-binding domain, and a 2-oxoacid_dh domain. CgFDX1 and CgDLAT mRNA were expressed in all the examined tissues. After elesclomol treatment, both mRNA and protein expressions of them were reduced in the hemocytes. The mortality rate of the hemocytes increased significantly, and the hemocytes were accompanied with noticeable adhesive abnormalities and heightened secretion after elesclomol treatment. Additionally, the accumulation or depletion of actin was observed in the hemocytes. The integrity of the double membrane structure of the mitochondria was compromised, and the organization of mitochondrial cristae was disrupted. The contents of copper, malondialdehyde (MDA), pyruvic acid and mitoSOX as well as the ratio of cells with low mitochondrial potential increased significantly in the hemocytes upon elesclomol treatment and the content of citric acid decreased significantly. These findings suggest the potential presence of cuproptosis in oysters and its activation mechanism is relatively conserved in evolution.",

Immunohistochemically, the increase in contractility of smooth muscle cells and testosterone hormone can be measured by an increase in the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and androgen receptor (AR). AIM: This study aims to determine the distribution and increased α-SMA expression and AR in the testis of Wistar rats after administration of PGF2α which was detected using the immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. METHODS: A total of 15 male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) with body weight 200-250 g and 8-10 weeks old were used in this study. All rats were acclimated for 2 weeks. The rats were divided into five treatment groups (n = 3). The rat in the control group (P0), testicular collection was carried out 30 minutes after injection of 0.5 ml NaCl. In groups P1, P2, P3, and P4, the rats were intraperitoneal injected with 2.5 mg/kg BW of PGF2α (Lutalyze, Zoetis, USA), and the testis collection was performed 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after PGF2α injection, respectively, were processed into histology preparations and stained with IHC staining using avidin-biotin complex peroxidase method. The distribution of α-SMA and AR was analyzed descriptively, while the score difference of α-SMA and AR expression was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U Test. RESULTS: The results showed that α-SMA was positively detected in peritubular myoid (PTM) cells on the basal membrane of seminiferous tubules, blood vessel (BV) walls, and connective tissue. Statistical analysis showed that α-SMA expression in PTM cells and testicular connective tissue in P2 (60-minute interval) was significantly different than other treatment groups (P0, P1, P3, and P4) (p < 0.05), while no significant difference was found in the BV walls in all treatment groups (p > 0.05). AR was positively detected in connective tissue, PTM cells, Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and BVs. Statistical analysis showed significant differences in AR expression in PTM cells and Sertoli cells (p < 0.05) between P0 and P2, P1 and P2, and P2 and P3 or P4. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the administration of PGF2α increases the expression of α-SMA and AR, with the optimal administration interval is 60 minutes for PTM cells and Sertoli cells in Wistar rats testis.",

Several therapeutic approaches exist, most of which are based on case reports or small non-comparative case series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of oral biotin and pyridoxine for treating onychoschizia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective comparative study was conducted among patients with idiopathic fingernail onychoschizia. Patients were prescribed 1 mg/day biotin, or 100 mg/day pyridoxine or both, for 3 months. Complete response (improvement of more than 90%) and partial response (improvement of more than 50%) were assessed after 6 to 9 months. RESULTS: The study included 61 patients with fingernail onychoschizia (mean age 40.5 years [range 20-68 years]). The average number of affected fingernails was 7.0 (&plusmn;2.0) per patient. The nail condition lasted 11.6 (&plusmn;4.7) years on average. The combined treatment regimen achieved significantly higher rates of complete response compared to biotin or pyridoxine alone (69.6% vs 10%, 11.1%, respectively; P values &lt; .001). Partial response (&gt;50% improvement) was achieved in an additional 30.4%, 45%, and 38.9% of patients treated with combined regimen vs biotin or pyridoxine alone, respectively.

Insufficiency of essential micronutrients has been associated with hair loss. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an oral supplement containing l-Cystine, Serenoa repens, Cucurbita pepo, Pygeum africanum, vitamins, and micronutrients in chronic TE (CTE) and androgenetic alopecia (AGA). METHODS: Eighty patients of both sexes aged 18-60 years with CTE or AGA were randomized to receive one capsule daily of the oral supplement or placebo for 6 months. Dermatological evaluations, clinical pictures and phototrichograms were done at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The overall hair volume and appearance were assessed before and after treatment as well as subject's self-assessment via standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Hair density increased by 9.9 hairs/cm2 after 3 months and 12.3 hairs/cm2 after 6 months in the oral supplement group and it is statistically significant when compared to placebo. Overall hair volume after 1, 3, and 6 months is better in the supplement group than in the placebo group. The oral supplement was well tolerated. No moderate or severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation can increase hair density, anagen hairs, and overall hair appearance in patients with AGA or CTE."

      "abstract": "Antibody discovery can benefit from techniques to screen antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) at scale for the binding and functionality of a diverse set of secreted antibodies. Previously, we demonstrated the use of cavity-containing hydrogel microparticles (nanovials) coated with a single affinity agent, biotin, to capture and identify ASCs secreting antibodies against a recombinant antigen bound to the nanovial through biotin-streptavidin linkages. However, rapidly secreted antibodies from unbound cells or cells in adjacent nanovials can cause crosstalk leading to background signal. Earlier efforts address this by localizing capture sites to the nanovial cavity, emulsifying nanovials, or short secretion times to limit secreted antibodies from binding to neighboring nanovials. Here, we demonstrate a method to functionalize nanovials with moieties that impart orthogonal reactivity, enabling conjugation of cell capture antibodies and antigens at different times. We show that by using a strained alkyne moiety to attach cell-capture antibodies via click chemistry to nanovials, we can capture cells and subsequently quantify secretions via biotin-streptavidin linkages. By delaying the loading of antigens onto the nanovials until after cell capture, we were able to ensure high purity (>95%) isolation of hybridoma secreting an antigen-specific antibody in a background of other hybridoma. This approach allows tight temporal control of the secretion measurement, which is independent of the cell loading time and requires less convective transfer steps. Click chemistry-based coupling further improved cell loading into nanovials by 58% compared to biotin-streptavidin-biotin coupling and caused no reduction in cell viability. We demonstrate an implementation of this system to improve antigen-specific hybridoma screening, yielding an 8-fold improvement in hybridoma enrichment while maintaining similar workflow complexity. Hybridomas on nanovials sorted into well plates regrew into colonies following sorting using standard fluorescence-activated cell sorting and maintained secretion of antigen-specific antibodies with high purity (∼90%), as validated via standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. This lab-on-a-particle approach can be applied more generally to decouple cell loading, treatment, or activation, from secretion measurements for single-cell functional assays.",

      "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising cancer treatment known for its deep tumor penetration and high efficacy. However, developing highly efficient sonosensitizers remains a significant challenge. Reports on SDT using aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are rare, highlighting the urgent need for novel AIE-active sonosensitizers. For the first time, we have developed tumor- and macrophage-targeting nano micelles, AIE/Biotin/Mannose-M (ABM-M), utilizing aggregation-induced emission polymers. The ABM-M mediate immunogenic cell death through SDT. By reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), they promote the conversion of M2 macrophages into M1 macrophages, reversing the tumor's immunosuppressive environment. We optimized the ratio of functional molecules to achieve maximum fluorescence intensity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The multi-targeting nature of ABM-M enables them to bind to relevant antibodies or other molecules, enhancing the capture and presentation of tumor antigens. This, in turn, activates the immune responses of dendritic cells and T cells while inhibiting angiogenesis, creating a more favorable microenvironment for antitumor therapy. Furthermore, ABM-M can be combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies, to achieve promising outcomes in cancer immunotherapy. The ABM-M nanomaterials offer multi-layered and multi-targeting immune regulation. This study provides a blueprint for developing next-generation cancer diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our research pioneers the use of nanomicelles to simultaneously target both tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), integrated with sonodynamic therapy. Through precise ratio adjustments, we engineered nanomicelles capable of multi-target regulation. These micelles uniquely induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and repolarize macrophages from an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype to an immunostimulatory M1 phenotype, reversing the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment. This dual mechanism can be enhanced by combining with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies, offering a promising strategy to treat refractory cancers. Extensive in vitro and in vivo validation confirms their therapeutic potential, providing a solid foundation for clinical application. This innovative approach shows significant promise for revolutionizing cancer treatment and improving patient outcomes.",

This study explores the connections among immune responses, metabolites, and the gut microbiota in PLWH with differing reactions to ART. METHODS: We analyzed the gut microbiota composition, metabolites, and immune markers in 38 PLWH who showed an immunological response (IR) and 32 who did not (INR), as classified according to CD4+ T-cell levels after 24 months of ART. Additionally, in vitro assays using cell counting kit 8, flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR were employed to assess the effects of the metabolites on cell viability, immune marker expression, and cytokine levels. RESULTS: Gut microbiota and metabolic profiles differed significantly between the IR and INR groups. Enterococcus was more abundant in the INR group, whereas [Ruminococcus]_gnavus_group levels were reduced. Significant metabolic pathway alterations included decreased folate biosynthesis and biotin metabolism. We observed negative associations of Parabacteroides with activation markers on CD4+ T-cells, and positive correlations with CD4/CD8 ratios. Enterococcus showed inverse relationships with these markers. Indole-3-acetyl-beta-1-D-glucoside (area under the curve value = 0.8931), had the best discriminatory ability. Further experiments showed that Indole-3-acetyl-beta-1-D-glucoside significantly decreased the proportions of CD4+CD57+, effector CD4+, CD4+PD1+, CD8+CD57+, effector CD8+, and CD8+HLA-DR+ T cells. Moreover, mRNA expression analysis showed that Indole-3-acetyl-beta-1-D-glucoside treatment led to a suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: The multi-omics approach highlighted potential biomarkers for immune recovery in HIV, suggesting avenues for further research into treatment strategies."

The juxtaposition of the cleavage sites is ligated by DNA ligase to form intact double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates that can be amplified via RPA to produce abundant dsDNA products labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 fluorophores and biotin, respectively. The resultant dsDNA can be captured by magnetic beads and subsequently disassembled into dispersed Cy3 and Cy5 molecules upon heat treatment, generating significant fluorescence signals. This assay exhibits a limit of detection of 1.12 × 10-10 U μL-1 for Fpg and 1.66 × 10-9 U μL-1 for FEN1, and it can be used for the analysis of enzymatic kinetic parameters, screening of inhibitors, and simultaneous monitoring of Fpg and FEN1 in a single cell and in clinic tissue samples. Moreover, the proposed strategy can be applied to monitor other DNA repair proteins by merely changing the recognition sites of dsDNA substrate probes, providing a promising platform for clinical diagnosis, biomedical research, and drug discovery.",

      "abstract": "Chemical modification of naturally derived glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) expands their potential utility for applications in soft tissue repair and regenerative medicine. Here we report the preparation of a novel crosslinked chondroitin sulfate (~200 to 2000 kilodaltons) that is both soluble in aqueous solution and microfilterable. We refer to these materials as \"SuperGAGs.\" One can further conjugate these materials with diverse capture agents to further modify polymer properties and add new capabilities. A representative material (GLX-100) demonstrated durable restoration of bladder impermeability in a gold standard animal model of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS). Histologic examination of the animal bladders treated with a GLX-100 SuperGAG conjugated to biotin as a reporter demonstrated that the residence time of GLX-100 is superior to chondroitin sulfate (a product that is currently used for clinical treatment of patients with IC/BPS). As expected, this novel crosslinked GAG biopolymer was restricted to the luminal surface of the bladder wall. In this communication we describe a simple and versatile synthesis of a crosslinked glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biopolymer for soft tissue repair. Chondroitin sulfate (~12 kD) was crosslinked to form a water soluble and microfilterable polymer with approximately 200 to 2000 kD molecular weight. The synthesis presented here allows for control of molecular weight while avoiding formation of an extended block gel. Moreover, the procedure enables further chemical modification of the SuperGAG through the selection of a capture agent. A set of agents have been used, demonstrating the preparation of a family of SuperGAGs with diverse capabilities. We can optimize polymer properties, adjust adherence to various tissues, add reporters, and engage the biochemistry of surrounding tissues with peptides and other bioactives.",

      "abstract": "Tetrandrine (TET), a natural bisbenzyl isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from Stephania tetrandra S. Moore, has diverse pharmacological effects. However, its effects on melanoma remain unclear. Cellular proliferation assays, multi-omics analyses, and xenograft models were used to determine the effect of TET on melanoma. The direct target of TET was identified using biotin-TET pull-down liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), cellular thermal shift assays, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis. Our findings revealed that TET treatment induced robust cellular autophagy depending on activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Simultaneously, it hindered autophagic flux by inducing cytoskeletal protein depolymerization in melanoma cells. TET treatment resulted in excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and simultaneously triggered mitophagy. Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) was ultimately found to be a direct target of TET. Mechanistically, TET led to the degradation of SIRT5 via the ubiquitin (Ub)-26S proteasome system. SIRT5 knockdown induced ROS accumulation, whereas SIRT5 overexpression attenuated the TET-induced ROS accumulation and autophagy. Importantly, TET exhibited anti-cancer effects in xenograft models depending on SIRT5 expression. This study highlights the potential of TET as an antimelanoma agent that targets SIRT5. These findings provide a promising avenue for the use of TET in melanoma treatment and underscore its potential as a therapeutic candidate."

Inulin is a substrate that can be utilized by the microbiota. This study aimed to determine whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) combined with inulin played a \"1 + 1 > 2\" role in enhancing the development and function of immune organs. Chicks were treated with 1 % inulin and/or fecal microbiota suspension on days 1-6. The growth performance, immune organ development, and immune indicators were evaluated on days 7, 14, and 21. Results showed that the combination of FMT and inulin significantly increased the immune organ index on day 7 and promoted the morphological structure and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in immune organs on days 7, 14, and 21. Each treatment increased the gene expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-2 (IL-2), B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFFR), B cell linker (BLNK), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4), and Biotin (Bu-1) to varying degrees. FMT combined with inulin significantly increased the expression of IgA-positive cells on days 7 and 14. In conclusion, the synergistic effect of FMT and inulin had beneficial impacts on the development and function of immune organs.",

      "abstract": "Demyelination is commonly observed in neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Biotin supplementation is known to stabilize MS progression. To reduce the effective dose of biotin, we synthesized a new and superior form of biotin, a complex of magnesium ionically bound to biotin (MgB) and compared its dose-dependent effect with biotin alone after inducing demyelination using lysolecithin (LPC) in rats. Myelination was assessed using luxol fast blue staining and immunostaining against MBP protein, revealing that the most significant remyelination occurred in the MgB groups. Additionally, both biotin and MgB-treated animals showed dose-dependent improvements in spatial memory. Moreover, we detected a decrease in inflammatory proteins in both treatment groups, which was more prominent in high-dose MgB-treated animals and correlated with decreased expression of NF-κB p65, OP, and MMP-9 proteins. Further analysis of biotin-related proteins demonstrated that both biotin and, notably, MgB reversed the demyelination-dependent reduction of these proteins. Furthermore, biotin, particularly MgB, improved neuronal transmission proteins, Synapsin-1, PSD-93, and PSD-95. Additionally, both treatment groups exhibited increased BDNF, GAP43, and ICAM levels, with significant increments observed in high-dose MgB-treated animals. Increased GFAP, indicative of reactive gliosis, was observed in LPC-treated animals, and this effect was notably reversed by high-dose MgB treatment. The current data emphasize the dose-dependent beneficial effect on the remyelination process. Furthermore, the combination of biotin with Mg resulted in a more potent effect compared to biotin by itself. The strong influence of MgB encourages proof-of-concept studies using MgB in patients with MS.",

The poly(Tyr-CB)-coated surfaces demonstrated excellent antifouling performance against proteins and cells and imparted (super)hydrophilicity to various substrates. Additionally, post-functionalization with external biotin-PEG-thiol was achieved by targeting the oxidized quinone groups within the poly(Tyr-CB) film network. This enabled biospecific binding to streptavidin, while non-specific interactions were suppressed due to the antifouling background. As our one-step antifouling coating method is simple, involves aqueous conditions, and could be generically used to coat various substrates, it can be a versatile and valuable tool for biosensing, high-throughput screening, and cell-surface engineering.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protein palmitoylation, a critical posttranslational modification, plays an indispensable role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein stability, mediation of membrane fusion, facilitation of intracellular protein trafficking, and participation in cellular signaling pathways. It is also implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as cancer, neurological disorders, inflammation, metabolic disorders, infections, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, its regulatory effects on sperm physiology, particularly motility, remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which protein palmitoylation governs sperm motility. METHODS: Protein palmitoylation in situ in mouse sperm was observed using innovative click chemistry. Sperm motility and motion parameters were evaluated using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer (CASA) after treatment with 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP), a specific inhibitor of protein palmitoylation. Protein palmitoylation levels were confirmed by the acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) method. The interplay between protein palmitoylation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and intracellular calcium was investigated using Western blotting, ABE method, and fluorescent probes. The regulation of reactive oxygen species was also examined using fluorescent probes. RESULTS: Localized patterns and dynamics of protein palmitoylation in distinct sperm regions were revealed, including the midpiece, post-acrosomal region, acrosome, and head. Alterations in protein palmitoylation in sperm were observed under in vitro physiological conditions. Treatment with 2BP significantly affected sperm motility and motion parameters. The study revealed interactions between protein palmitoylation, including heat shock protein 90, and protein kinase A/protein kinase C-associated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and intracellular calcium. Additionally, protein palmitoylation was found to be involved in reactive oxygen species regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Protein palmitoylation regulates sperm motility through calcium signaling, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and reactive oxygen species. This study revealed the characteristics of protein palmitoylation in sperm and its role in regulating sperm motility, thereby providing novel insights into the causes of asthenozoospermia associated with sperm motility in humans.",

Hydrogen-rich medium is reported to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the role of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) in cutaneous wound healing remains largely unexplored, especially by metabolomics. Thus, untargeted metabolomics profiling was analysed to study the effects and mechanism of HRS combined with vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) in a rabbit full-thickness wound model. Our results indicated that the combination treatment of HRS and VSD could accelerate wound healing. In vitro experiments further confirmed its effects on HaCaT keratinocytes. We found that 45 metabolites were significantly changed between the VSD + HRS group and the VSD + saline-treated group. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that biotin metabolism was the potential target pathway. The biochemical interpretation analysis demonstrated that combining HRS and VSD might enhance mitochondrial function, ATP synthesis, and GSH homeostasis by altering biotin metabolism. The detection of representative indicators of oxidative stress supported the critical metabolic pathway analysis as well. In summary, VSD combined with HRS might provide a new strategy to enhance wound healing.",

In this study, we developed a small molecule boron carrier, biotinyl-closo-dodecaborate conjugate with an iodophenyl moiety (BBC-IP), incorporating biotin as a ligand for biotin receptors overexpressed in various cancer cells, alongside an albumin ligand and boron source. BBC-IP exhibited high water solubility, minimal cytotoxicity, and superior cellular uptake compared to BPA in both human and mouse cancer cells. Biodistribution studies revealed that BBC-IP achieved enhanced tumor accumulation (9.7 μg [B]/g, 3 h) in mouse colon tumors, surpassing BPA's accumulation levels (7.2 μg [B]/g, 3 h) at a dose of 15 mg [B]/kg. However, despite this improved tumor accumulation, BPA demonstrated superior BNCT efficacy. The intracellular localization of boron agents in tumor cells revealed that BPA localized throughout the cell, whereas BBC-IP localized mainly in the cytoplasm. These results indicate the intratumoral localization, as well as tumor accumulation are critical for the efficacy of novel BNCT agents."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CD133 is regarded as a marker and target for cancer stem cells (CSCs) in various types of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expressions of CD133 and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in CSCs exhibit a positive feedback regulatory effect. This effect promotes CSC proliferation and immune escape, ultimately leading to tumor progression and poor prognosis. METHODS: CD133-specific antibodies and miR-107-3p loaded nanobubbles (miR-107-3p/CD133 Ab-NBs) were assembled using various techniques, such as the biotin-avidin system and cationic lipid nanobubbles. The relationship between miR-107-3p and PD-L1 was established via a miR-107-3p mimic/inhibitor using RT-qPCR and Western blot methods. The miR-107-3p/CD133 Ab-NBs were characterized, and their pharmacokinetic attributes were studied in combination with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD). Subsequently, the anti-tumor efficacy and mechanism were scrutinized both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: miR-107-3p/CD133Ab NBs were successfully prepared through CD133Ab conjugation and miR-107-3p loading, yielding an average particle size of 342.0 ± 26.3 nm, and presenting as spherical particles with uniform size and distribution. By using a mouse subcutaneous transplanted tumor model, paired with UTMD, we found that miR-107-3p/CD133Ab-NBs could significantly accumulate at the tumor site, as observed through the IVIS Spectrum system. These nanoparticles showed considerable anti-tumor activity against HCC, both in vitro and in the xenograft mouse model. Further findings indicated that miR-107-3p/CD133Ab-NBs promoted lymphocyte proliferation enhanced the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing activity, and increased cytokine gene expression. This suggests that the combination of miR-107-3p/CD133Ab-NBs with UTMD could enhance anti-cancer immune responses by inhibiting PD-L1 with miR-107-3p and targeting CD133 on the CSCs of HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study introduces a novel strategy for ultrasound-targeted microbubbles containing miR-107-3p and CD133Ab. This strategy demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity against HCC by blocking the positive feedback of CD133 and PD-L1 expression in CSCs. Thus, it reveals a potential advantage of combined miR-107-3p/CD133 Ab-NBs therapy for HCC.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Substance use disorders, particularly alcohol use disorders, represent a significant public health problem, with adolescents particularly vulnerable to their adverse effects. This study examined the possible anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of biotin, a crucial vitamin for brain function, in attenuating the behavioral and neurobiological changes associated with alcohol withdrawal in adolescent rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a 20% ethanol solution for 21 days, followed by a 21-day drug-free period to assess long-term behavioral and physiological changes. Behavioral assessments included the Open Field Test, Elevated Plus Maze, and Forced Swimming Test, administered post-withdrawal to evaluate anxiety and depression behaviors. Additionally, biochemical analyses were performed to measure serotonin levels, monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) activity, and BDNF concentrations. RESULTS: The results indicate that ethanol withdrawal significantly induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior in the rats. However, treatment with biotin, particularly at higher doses, effectively attenuated these withdrawal-related behavioral changes. Mechanistically, biotin administration was found to regulate serotonin levels, monoamine oxidase activity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, and alleviate oxidative stress markers in cortical tissue. DISCUSSION: The results of this study suggest that biotin may have therapeutic potential for alleviating the negative effects of alcohol withdrawal, particularly those related to anxiety and depression. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and examine the clinical effects of biotin supplementation for individuals undergoing alcohol withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Brevetoxins are a type of neurotoxin produced in red tide blooms. Northern quahogs (M. mercenaria) are extensively used in commercial aquaculture farming, and early-stage metabolomics studies can provide early warnings of brevetoxins for farmers. In this study, NMR-based metabolomics was performed to investigate the response of clam gills and digestive glands under a series of sublethal doses of brevetoxins. Our study showed that the brevetoxin PbTx-2 had minimal influence on the physical activities of M. mercenaria for a short exposure time (24 hours). However, major metabolic level perturbations were observed in the clam gill extracts from the 1 ppb treatment. In addition, in the low concentration (0.1 ppb) study, clam gills showed combinational metabolite perturbations, as observed by an OPLS-DA study. The highly disturbed metabolites in the gill samples were the upregulated serine, glucose, hypotaurine, and glycine and the downregulated lactate, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, biotin, taurine, and valine. The results indicated that the brevetoxin PbTx-2 potentially affects glycolysis, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and biotin metabolism. While the digestive gland had less significantly changed metabolites, the potential combinational metabolite changes from PCA were observed from the 5-ppb treatment. Glucose and glycine are the primary metabolites that showed high contributions to the OPLS-DA model, which indicates the potential influence of digestive activities. The study indicated that metabolomic analysis of the gills and digestive glands of M. mercenaria is a feasible method to monitor the toxicity of brevetoxins, especially under sublethal doses in marine water.",

In this study, we synthesized a biotin-labeled GB probe (GB-biotin) to identify the molecular targets of GB. Our experiments demonstrated that treatment with GB or GB-biotin reduced mitochondrial injury, restored mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, GB increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, indicating improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Proteomic analysis revealed that the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a key protein that interacts with GB-biotin. This finding was further confirmed through cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and molecular docking, which revealed hydrogen bond formation between GB and VDAC1. Furthermore, overexpression of VDAC1 diminished the protective effects of GB, highlighting the crucial role of VDAC1 in GB-mediated cardioprotection. These findings identify VDAC1 as a therapeutic target for GB in vitro, providing valuable insights into the cardioprotective mechanisms of GB and the development of novel cardioprotective strategies.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The dried fruit of Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge (Hawthorn in Chinese) is a traditional medicine used in China, Japan and Korea for thousands of years. Hawthorn is documented in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, as a folk medicine that is used to eliminate food, strengthen the stomach, move qi and dissipate blood stasis, treat stagnation of meat and food, gastric distention and fullness, and has anti-inflammatory effects. Vitexin, a flavonoid glycoside, is an important biologically active compound derived from Hawthorn, with significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The pharmacological effects of Hawthorn are highly correlated with the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of vitexin. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of vitexin on the alleviation of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) induced by 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in a rat model, as well as to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAG was administered at a concentration of 170 μg/mL MNNG in the drinking water of rats, and the effects of vitexin (30 mg/kg, once daily for 6 weeks) on gastric tissues were subsequently analyzed. Pathological damage was assessed using H&E and AB-PAS staining. Gastrointestinal hormone levels, specifically motilin (MTL) and gastrin (GAS), were quantified using biochemical index determination kits. To evaluate the levels of cytokines, specifically IL-1β and IL-18, in gastric tissue, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed. Additionally, to investigate the effects of vitexin on the NLRP3 inflammasome, GES-1 cells were subjected to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The targeting of NLRP3 by vitexin was assessed in vitro using CESTA, DARTS, and a synthesized biotin-labeled vitexin probe (biotin-vitexin) in conjunction with dual immunofluorescence. RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the ameliorative effect of oysterin on LPS + ATP-induced GES-1 cells in vitro. RESULTS: Administration of vitexin significantly alleviated the symptoms of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) by reducing weight loss and minimizing gastric tissue damage. Treatment with vitexin in CAG rats effectively reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, vitexin attenuated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in CAG induced by MNNG. Mechanistic experiments showed that NLRP3 is a direct cellular target of vitexin, while vitexin inhibited rat NLRP3 inflammasome. CONCLUSION: Vitexin mitigates MNNG-induced CAG, and its protective effect is linked to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

      "abstract": "Islet transplantation is a promising therapy for diabetes, yet the limited survival and functionality of transplanted islet grafts hinder optimal outcomes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an endogenous hormone, has shown potential to enhance islet survival and function; however, its systemic administration can result in poor localization and undesirable side effects. To address these challenges, we developed a novel peptide-based nanofiber hydrogel incorporating GLP-1 functionality for localized delivery. By conjugating the FFG tripeptide (a self-assembling motif derived from phenylalanine-phenylalanine-glycine) to the C-terminus of native GLP-1, we engineered GLP-1-FFG, a self-assembling peptide that forms a robust nanofiber structure resistant to enzymatic degradation. When GLP-1-FFG co-assembles with the biotin-DFYIGSRGD peptide (referred to as SupraGel), a self-assembling supramolecular polypeptide hydrogel we previously identified containing motifs derived from extracellular matrix components, the resulting hydrogel (SupraGel + GLP-1-FFG) creates a stable nanofibrous network with excellent rheological properties. In vitro, this nanofiber hydrogel significantly improves islet function and survival. Bulk RNA sequencing results demonstrate that the hydrogel suppresses the expression of hypoxia-related genes, downregulates pro-inflammatory genes, and upregulates genes associated with islet function. Further analysis reveals that these effects are related to the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. In a syngeneic mouse islet transplantation model, the localized application of SupraGel + GLP-1-FFG at the renal subcapsular islet transplant site significantly enhanced the efficacy of marginal-dose islet transplantation, as shown by improved glycemic control, faster and higher rates of diabetes reversal, better glucose tolerance, and greater islet graft survival in diabetic recipient mice. This innovative nanotechnology-based hydrogel offers a promising strategy for enhancing the efficacy of islet grafts in transplantation therapy.",

      "abstract": "Bioorthogonalized light-responsive click-and-uncage platform has enabled precise cell surface engineering and timed payload release, but most of such photoactivatable prodrugs have \"always-on\" photoactivity leading to the dark toxicity. On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)-boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY. The uncaged BODIPY upon the bioorthogonal transformation of the tetrazine reinstates fluorescence on-target to guide the subsequent visible light irradiation thereby releasing the therapeutic payload in situ. The proof of concept for such \"light where is lit up\"-activated theranostics was demonstrated by the tetrazine-BODIPY conjugated SN-38 (1) with masked fluorescence, up to 70 times-reduced cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine unit on 1 and a biotinylated trans-cyclooctene (biotin-TCO) as a pretargeted trigger on tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell-selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation (500-520 nm) to activate the caged drug SN-38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells, offering high spatiotemporal precision of disease diagnosis and therapy.",

Tibetan golden acupuncture (GA) is a common treatment for ischemic brain injury in Tibetan. The aim of this study was to explore whether GA prevents cerebral ischemia-reperfusion-induced apoptosis in mice by blocking the JNK/caspase-3 pathway. METHODS: In experiment I, 36 mice were randomly divided into a Sham group, CI/RI group, CI/RI + GA group. Morris water maze tests, TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to evaluate the effect of the GA intervention on CI/RI. In experiment II, 30 mice were randomly divided into a Sham group, CI/RI group, CI/RI + GA group, CI/RI + SP group and CI/RI + SP + EA group. Western blotting was used to detect protein expression of key factors in the JNK signaling pathway in the hippocampus. RESULTS: After 7 and 14 interventions, behavioral evaluations in CI/RI + GA group was significantly different from those in CI/RI groups (p < 0.01), pathological injury and apoptosis were significantly reduced (p < 0.01). Compared with CI/RI group, the expression of P-JNK/JNK, Cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, Bax, and Bad proteins in CI/RI + GA group, CI/RI + SP and CI/RI + SP + GA groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.01). The expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was significantly increased (p < 0.01, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: GA can restore neurological dysfunction and inhibit hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in CI/RI mice, at least partially through inhibition of the JNK/Caspase-3 signaling pathway and regulation of apoptosis signals."

      "abstract": "Bioremediation of Cr(Ⅵ) and ammonia is considered as a promising and cost-effective alternative to chemical and physical methods. However, Cr(Ⅵ) could inhibit nitrogen removal by inhibiting intra-/extracellular electron (IET/EET) transfer or nitrifying and denitrifying enzymes activity due to its higher solubility. In this study, we isolated a simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) microorganism Acinetobacter haemolyticus RH19, capable of outcompeting oxygen to take nitrogen oxides/ammonia as electron acceptors, and studied a combined accelerant (cysteine, biotin and cytokinin) to relive the Cr(Ⅵ) stress. Respiratory chain inhibited experiments and intermediates showed that strain RH19 had the intact intracellular respiratory chain. Despite the inhibited complex Ⅳ favoring the electrons transfer to NOx--N, the SND process was still greatly inhibited with Cr(Ⅵ), likely attributed to lower electron flow to the electron acceptors (nitration/nitrition/denitrification enzyme). Instead, the accelerant detoxified Cr(Ⅵ) mainly at CoQ site responsible for electron transfer to AMO and NAP, as well as complex Ⅳ (related with aerobic denitrification), favoring the shortcut SND (SSND, NH4+-N→NH2ON→NO2--N→N2) process by directly converting nitrite to nitrogen gases. Additionally, accelerant could stimulate the secretion of c-Cyts and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to improve the electron transfer. Overall, this study highlighted the accelerant-alleviated mechanism in the SND process under Cr(Ⅵ) stress, and deepened the theoretical SND basis for the treatment of co-existing pollutants.",

To gain a deeper understanding of how storage conditions impact donor platelet recirculation and functionality post-transfusion, ex vivo platelet labeling is a feasible approach. However, before pursuing clinical investigations of platelet recirculation and function in humans, we aimed to determine the effects of pathogen inactivation technology (PIT) and storage conditions (4°C vs. room temperature [RT]) on phenotype and function of biotinylated platelets compared to conventional PIT PCs for transfusion. METHODS: Nine PCs were prepared in 61% additive solution from 45 buffy coats (five buffy coats each). A pool-and-split of three units was used to prepare three equivalent PCs: two labeled with biotin and stored at RT or 4°C, and one without labeling and stored at RT. All PCs were then treated by PIT (amotosalen/UVA) and stored for 14 days. Labeling efficiency, platelet concentration, metabolic parameters, aggregation response (ADP, collagen, co-aggregation with epinephrine), and platelet phenotype (CD42b, CD62-P, phosphatidylserine) at the basal stage and upon stimulation (ADP or TRAP-6) were performed. RESULTS: Labeling efficiency of PIT and 4°C PCs was stable over 14 days of storage. Differences in platelet function and phenotype were mainly due to the storage temperature and not the biotinylation process. Phenotypes at baseline or after stimulation were equivalent in biotin-positive and biotin-negative platelets. CONCLUSION: Biotin-labeled platelets can effectively enable investigation of the effects of PIT and storage temperature for clinical studies. This method shows great potential for improving platelet transfusion knowledge.",

This paper was designed to explore the effect and mechanisms of Aconitum diphtheria on the proliferation and apoptosis of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS). First, RA-FLS was treated with different doses of A. diphtheria extracts. Then, an inverted biological microscope was adopted to observe the RA-FLS morphology. Subsequently, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining, Cell Counting Kit-8 and western blot were utilized to analyze the apoptosis, proliferation, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway-related proteins in RA-FLS, respectively. The experimental results disclosed that, after treatment of RA-FLS with A. diphtheria extracts, the cells became round and the intercellular space was increased. Besides, the RA-FLS proliferation was effectively inhibited by A. diphtheria extracts, while the apoptosis was promoted. Additionally, A. diphtheria extracts could effectively downregulate the expression levels of p-NF-κB (p50), NF-κB (p50), p-NF-κB (p65), and NF-κB (p65). Collectively, A. diphtheria can effectively inhibit RA-FLS proliferation and promote apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, A. diphtheria is able to downregulate p-NF-κB and NF-κB protein expression, but there is no dose-response relationship.",

      "abstract": "Biotin receptors, as biomarkers for cancer cells, are overexpressed in various tumor types. Compared to other vitamin receptors, such as folate receptors and vitamin B12 receptors, biotin receptor-based targeting strategies exhibit superior specificity and broader potential in treating aggressive cancers, including ovarian cancer, leukemia, colon cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, and lung cancer. These strategies promote biotin transport via receptor-mediated endocytosis, which is triggered upon ligand binding. Biotin, as the ligand of the biotin receptor, can be conjugated to anti-cancer drugs to form targeted therapies that bind to receptors overexpressed on tumor cells, thus increasing drug uptake. Despite these advantages, many candidate drugs have progressed slowly and remain in the preclinical stage, impeding clinical translation. This is mainly due to the effects of various conjugation methods and drug formulations on their functionality and efficacy. Therefore, developing novel biotin-based therapeutics is crucial. The innovation of this strategy lies in its multifunctionality-researchers can use different conjugation methods to design and synthesize these drugs, enabling precise targeting of various tumor types while minimizing toxicity to normal cells. These drugs include small-molecule-biotin conjugates (SMBCs) and nano-biotin conjugates (NBCs). This dual-platform approach represents a significant advancement in targeted therapy, offering unprecedented flexibility in drug design and delivery. Compared to chemotherapy drugs and traditional delivery systems, biotin-based drugs with tumor-specific targeting demonstrate enhanced targeting, improved efficacy, and reduced toxicity. This review examines strategies and applications for enhancing the delivery of chemotherapy drugs to cancer cells, highlighting the need for high-quality conjugates and strategies. It not only summarizes the latest progress but also provides key insights into how this emerging field could revolutionize personalized cancer treatment, especially in the context of precision medicine. Additionally, it offers perspectives on future research directions in this field.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: White spot lesions (WSLs) may develop in adolescents undergoing clear aligner (CA) therapy with poor oral hygiene. The specific effects of CAs on the microbial composition and functional characteristics of supragingival plaques remain unclear. The present study investigated the shift in the supragingival microbial community induced by CAs in adolescents through metagenomic technology. METHODS: Fifteen adolescents (12-15 years old) with Invisalign appliances were recruited. Supragingival plaque specimens were obtained twice, before treatment (T1) and three months after treatment (T2). All the bacterial plaque specimens were analyzed for microbial communities and functions using metagenomic analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2,840,242,722 reads disclosed 180 phyla, 3,975 genera, and 16,497 microbiome species. During the first three months, the microbial community was relatively stable. The genus level revealed a higher relative abundance of Capnocytophaga, Neisseria, and Arachnia in the T2 period. Furthermore, the functional analysis suggested that the relative abundances of folate biosynthesis, biotin metabolism and biofilm formation-vibrio cholerae were increased in the T2 period compared to the T1 period. Finally, virulence factor analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of genes associated with type IV pili (VF0082) and polar flagella (VF0473) was higher in the T2 period than in the T1 period. CONCLUSION: In adolescents undergoing CA therapy with poor plaque control, caries progresses quickly within three months and noticeable WSLs develop on the tooth surface. Although the microbial community remained relatively steady and CA therapy did not cause significant changes in the overall functional gene composition in the first three months, virulence factors, including type IV pili and flagella, were more abundant and actively contributed to microorganism adhesion and biofilm formation.",

Hence, inhibition of FAO through active CPT1 targeting could be a promising therapeutic approach in anti-TNBC therapies. Herein, we strategically synthesized a pyrene chain end labelled copolymer bearing biotin pendants, CP4, that actively targets CPT1 and efficiently blocks FAO in metastatic TNBC. Following the comprehensive characterization and synthesis of CP4, in silico negative docking score and Ramachandran plot analyses confirmed its on-target binding potential to CPT1. As a result, CP4 disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential, generates excessive ROS, and restricts excessive ATP production by impairing mitochondrial respiration, glycolytic function, and FAO. Subsequently, CP4 suppressed FA uptake and regulated FAO-associated gene expressions, exhibiting successive metastatic growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. Also, in an animal model, CP4 demonstrated active binding to CPT1, as evidenced by the significant depletion of CPT1A expression in tumor and liver tissue, akin to the specific CPT1-targeted drug. This active targeting of CPT1 has further consolidated the healing of altered lipid and oxidative stress, resulting in remarkable tumor regression, highlighting CP4 as a promising anticancer therapy focused on mitochondrial FAO, advancing future breast cancer treatments.",

To assess the effect of conjugating biotin (vitamin B7) to such compounds and improve their tumor-targeting ability through interaction with the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), the chlorido co-ligand was exchanged with biotinylated 6-aminoindazole. The complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and purity was determined by elemental analysis. The compounds were shown to be stable in aqueous solution but reacted in particular with biologically relevant nitrogen-donor ligands. The biotinylated organometallics were shown to be able to interact with the high-affinity biotin-binding protein streptavidin using molecular modelling. High antiproliferative activity of the biotinylated Rh complex (IC50 = 1.1-10 μM) and its chlorido precursor (IC50 = 2.1-7.0 μM) was demonstrated in human HCT116, NCI-H460, COLO 205, SW620, A2780 and A2780cis cancer cells, which feature differing levels of SMVT expression. While there was no clear relationship between the anticancer activity in cells and SMVT expression, the complexes showed similar activity in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant cells. The most potent was the biotinylated Rh derivative which displayed low toxicity toward zebrafish embryos with >75% survival up to day 4 and after treatment with up to 32 μM complex.",

The current study aims to explore involvement of isoforms of AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1 (AUF1) in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. METHODS: The cancer stem cell-like features were analyzed using colony formation assay, tumor sphere formation assay and nude mouse xenograft experiments. AUF1 isoforms expression was analyzed using immunoblotting, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. RIP and Biotin pulldown was used to analyze the interaction of SRSF2 and hnRNPA1 with AUF1 transcript. Transcriptome regulated by AUF1 isoforms was analyzed by RNA-seq. RESULTS: The current study demonstrated differential expression of AUF1 isoforms in cisplatin sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer tissues and cells. P37 isoform promoted proliferation, while p45 isoform enhanced responsiveness of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin. the clonal formation capacity of the cells, and the restoration of p45 expression reduced the capacity with cisplatin treatment. The competitive binding of phosphorylated hnRNPA1 and O-GlcNAc-modified SRSF2 on AUF1 exon 2 and exon 7 regulated the alternative splicing of AUF1. CONCLUSION: The competitive binding of phosphorylated hnRNPA1 and O-GlcNAc modified SRSF2 on exon 2 and exon 7 regulated the alternative splicing of AUF1 and subsequent isoform expression. P37 isoform played a \"cancer promoter\" role, p42 and p45, especially p45 played a \"cancer suppressor\" role in ovarian cancer.

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy is the most commonly used method to treat malignant tumors with a wide range of drugs. However, chemotherapeutic drugs are characterized by poor solubility, low stability and specificity, as well as drug resistance, which led to their limited bioavailability and severe adverse effects. Therefore, most researches focus on one or two strategies while a few researches focus on three strategies to improve the efficacy of drugs. Herein, we combined three strategies (targeted therapy, prodrug design and drug delivery) to exploit a self-assembled camptothecin (CPT) prodrug (CPT-SS-FFEYp-Biotin) for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects of CPT. CPT-SS-FFEYp-Biotin enters into tumor cells following the recognition between biotin and biotin receptors. Moreover, the over-expressed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on cell membranes specifically dephosphorylates CPT-SS-FFEYp-Biotin to CPT-SS-FFEY-Biotin, which self-assembles into a CPT hydrogel with the local enrichment of CPT. Subsequently, excess glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells can reduce the disulfide bond of CPT-SS-FFEY-Biotin to slowly release CPT for sustained tumor therapy. Cell experiments demonstrated that CPT-SS-FFEYp-Biotin enhances therapeutic efficacy of CPT on tumor cells while being safer to normal cells than CPT. Moreover, CPT-SS-FFEYp-Biotin effectively improved anti-tumor treatment of CPT in vivo. We envision that the integration of these three strategies is helpful to exploit a variety of prodrugs for effective anti-tumor treatment in the future.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency (HLCSD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) gene, which affects multiple systems. Common clinical manifestations include metabolic acidosis, rash, feeding difficulties, and growth retardation, with predominant involvement of the nervous system, skin, and hair. However, respiratory symptoms as the initial manifestation are relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 1 year and 4-month-old Chinese male patient who presented with a 2-day history of cough, followed by half a day of wheezing and shortness of breath. Despite supportive treatment with antibiotics upon admission, the infant continued to experience rapid and deep breathing accompanied by groaning, and obvious wheezing. Blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis that was difficult to correct. Blood tandem mass spectrometry showed elevations in C50H, C3, C4OH, and urine organic acid analysis revealed elevations in lactate, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, acetoacetic acid, 3-methylcrotonylglycine, and methylcitric acid. Genetic testing revealed two variants in the HLCS gene in the infant: NM_001352514: exon6: c.1088T>A: p.V363D variant and exon11: c.2434C>T: p.R812* heterozygous variant, resulting in HLCSD. Ultimately, the diagnosis of HLCSD was established, and oral biotin treatment achieved good clinical efficacy. CONCLUSION: This article summarizes the clinical data of a case of HLCSD in an infant, primarily presenting with respiratory symptoms. It provides a comprehensive summary of the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, offering insights for the diagnosis of rare diseases by clinical physicians."

However, the clinical application of curcumin is still limited due to its poor absorption and rapid metabolism. In this study, structural modification of curcumin by introducing active small organic acids into its pyrazole ring intermediate, was employed to yield five curcumin derivatives 5a-5e. All the target compounds were characterised by 1H NMR,13C NMR and ESI-MS. Biological evaluation through the CCK-8 method indicated that nearly all these derivatives displayed higher proliferation inhibitory effect on A549 cells than that of curcumin. Among them, 5d bearing biotin moiety exhibited even stronger cytotoxicity action (2.25 μmol/L) than the positive control drug Doxorubicin (3.99 μmol/L) and therefore became the most promising lead compound for further investigation. Our findings provided a potential approach for the structural optimisation of curcumin derivatization in cancer treatment."

We previously found that Aedes aegypti third-instar larvae cleared of their microbiota were impaired in their development, notably due to a lack of folic acid (vitamin B9). In this study, we found that diet supplementation using a cocktail of seven B vitamins did not improve mosquito developmental success, but rather had a significant impact on the sex-ratio of the resulting adults, with an enrichment of female mosquitoes emerging from B vitamin-treated larvae. A transcriptomic analysis of male and female larvae identified some sex-specific regulated genes upon vitamin treatment. When treating germ-free larvae with individual B vitamins, we detected a specific toxic effect related to biotin (vitamin B7) exposure at high concentrations. We then provided germ-free larvae with varying biotin doses and showed that males are sensitive to biotin toxicity at a lower concentration than females. Gnotobiotic larvae exposed to controlled low bacterial counts or with bacteria characterised by slower growth, show a male-enriched adult population, suggesting that males require less bacteria-derived nutrients than females. These findings indicate that during larval development, mosquitoes have sex-specific nutritional requirements and toxicity thresholds, which impact the sex ratio of adults.",

      "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a remarkable noninvasive tumor marker that plays a crucial role in tumor diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. However, detecting low-abundance ctDNA from a substantial amount of nucleic acids originating from healthy cells is challenging. Herein, we proposed a tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs)-assisted electrochemical biosensor for ctDNA detection. This biosensor combines a masking tactic with 3D-hybridization chain reactions. Masking hairpins (MHs) were initially introduced to prevent interference from wild-type (WT) DNA. Then, the initiator sequence was transferred to the electrode surface modified with TDNs by the target ctDNA. The initiator sequence triggers the 3D self-assembly of hairpin strands, leading to the formation of DNA networks or even DNA hydrogels (long reaction time). This process generates numerous evenly distributed biotin molecules that can bind to streptavidin peroxidase to considerably amplify the signal. This method exhibits high sensitivity (the minimum concentration for detecting ctDNA is 1 aM, which corresponds to 60 ctDNA molecules in 100 μl sample) and excellent specificity (single mismatch). More importantly, this high-performance sensor can detect ctDNA with other mutation sites and their mixtures by modifying the corresponding capture probes on the TDNs. Furthermore, this ultrasensitive sensor effectively detects target ctDNA (0.001 %) at high levels of WT DNA and in complex matrices such as serum. These findings suggest that the sensor has promising potential as a noninvasive tool for early tumor diagnosis.",

Pirfenidone (PFD), a new small-molecule drug, has been shown to improve lung function and inhibit pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. This study aimed to elucidate the effect and underlying mechanism of PFD on SILI in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SILI rats were constructed using a homemade smoking device, which was then treated with PFD. The blood was collected from the abdominal aorta, and the arterial blood gas was detected. The productions of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines in plasma were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay assay. Moreover, the alveolar surface area, wet:dry weight ratio of the lung tissues, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined as well. The pulmonary histopathology, cell apoptosis, and the related proteins of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway were determined by hematoxylin-eosin staining, TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling, and western blot assays, respectively. RESULTS: PFD had a significant protective effect on SILI via inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, PFD inhibited the activation of NF-κB pathway in vivo. Moreover, activation of NF-κB pathway attenuated the PFD-mediated protective effect against SILI. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that PFD alleviates SILI of rats via the NF-κB signaling pathway, which provides an attractive therapeutic option for SILI treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent years, exosomes have been increasing used to treat diseases, but there is little research on how exosomes affect the metabolism of the body after entering. Therefore, in this study, we discussed the changes of metabolic spectrum and determined the differentially expressed metabolites in the serum of cynomolgus monkeys after injecting exosomes. Six cynomolgus monkeys were divided into control group and exosomes group. After intravenous injection of exosomes, the peripheral blood serum of cynomolgus monkeys was collected at baseline, day 1, day 7 and day 14 respectively. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics platform was used to detect the metabolites. The metabolic spectra of two groups of cynomolgus monkeys were identified and compared, and the time series changes of metabolites in exosomes were described. RESULTS: The results showed that there was significant difference in metabolic spectrum between the two groups. 45, 114, 49, 39 differentially expressed metabolites were identified in baseline, day 1, day 7, and day 14, respectively. 6-hydroxydopamine, a metabolite related to the regulation of nerve function, was also found. Tryptophan metabolism, choline metabolism in cancer, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism were involved in day 1. Sphingolipid metabolism and histidine metabolism were involved in day 7. Three pathways, including choline metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and biotin metabolism in cancer were involved in day 14. Through time series analysis, it was found that the level of propionylcarnitine and biliverdin increased on day 1 after inoculation with exosomes, while the level of hippuric acid decreased. These changes of immune-related metabolites suggested that exosomes might participate in the immunoregulation reaction after entering the body of cynomolgus monkeys. CONCLUSIONS: In our current study, we found that exosomes injected intravenously affect the changes of metabolites and metabolic pathways in cynomolgus monkeys. Intravenous injection of exosomes may affect the metabolite 6-hydroxydopamine, sphingolipid metabolic pathway, and choline metabolic in cancer pathway, which is of some significance for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In addition, exosomes may also affect the immune-related metabolites in vivo, such as propionylcarnitine, biliverdin, hippuric acid metabolites, as well as tryptophan metabolism pathway, sphingolipid metabolism pathway involved in immune regulation, which is of great significance for the future study of immune-regulatory mechanisms of exosomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a key role in carboxylation. The formation of free biotin is impaired in biotinidase deficiency (BD), resulting in impaired biotin-dependent carboxylase functions. Based on the percentage of residual serum enzyme activity, BD is classified as partial and profound. METHODS: Retrospective data including gender, age, parental consanguinity, family history, biotinidase activity analyses, type of deficiency (partial-profound), physical examination, treatment, and genotypes were evaluated in patients diagnosed with biotinidase deficiency in a single center in the eastern region of Türkiye. Patients whose biotinidase enzyme activity was below 30% with biallelic variants in the BTD gene were diagnosed as BD. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included in the study. Parental consanguinity was present in 135 (44.7%) of them. Two hundred eighty-six (94.7%) were diagnosed by neonatal screening, 14 (4.6%) by family screening and two (0.06%) by clinical symptoms. Ninety-two (30.5%) of the patients were followed-up with profound deficiency and 210 (69.5%) with partial deficiency. A total of 306 variants were detected. Twenty different variants (3 novel - 3 rare) and 31 different genotypes were detected. The 3 most frequently detected variants were c.410G>A (p.Arg137His; 47.3%), c.1270G>C (p.Asp424His; 29.7%), and c.38_44delGCGGCTGinsTCC (p.Cys13Phefs*36; 15.3%). The 3 most frequently identified genotypes were c.410G>A (p.Arg137His) / c.1270G>C (p.Asp424His) compound heterozygous (32.4%), c.410G>A (p.Arg137His) homozygous (24.8%), and c.38_44delGCGGCTGinsTCC (p.Cys13Phefs*36) / c.1270G>C (p.Asp424His) compound heterozygous (12.2%). Patients with c.410G>A (p.Arg137His) homozygous variant, c.38_44delGCGGCTGinsTCC (p.Cys13Phefs*36) homozygous variant and c.38_44delGCGGCTGinsTCC (p.Cys13Phefs*36) / c.410G>A (p.Arg137His) compound heterozygous variant were statistically significantly associated with profound deficiency. Compound heterozygosity of c.410G>A (p.Arg137His) / c.1270G>C (p.Asp424His) variants were significantly associated with partial deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the BTD genotype and biochemical phenotype is not always consistent. Our study provides valuable data by adding variants with genotype-phenotype correlations to the literature and three novel variants, which can provide significant guidance in clinical follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO) and GO-based nanocomposites are promising in drug delivery and photothermal therapy due to their exceptional near-infrared optical absorption and high specific surface area. In this study, we have effectively conjugated an oxaliplatin (IV) prodrug, PEGylated graphene oxide, and PEGylated biotin (PB) in a single platform for breast cancer treatment. This platform demonstrates promising prospects for targeted drug delivery and the synergistic application of photothermal-chemotherapy when exposed to NIR-laser irradiation. The resulting nanocomposite (GO(OX)PB (1/1/0.2) NPs) displayed an exceptionally large surface area, minimal particle size (195.7 nm), specific targeting capabilities, a high drug load capacity (43.56 %) and entrapment efficiency (89.48 %) and exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and photostability when exposed to NIR-laser irradiation (808 nm). The therapeutic effectiveness was assessed both in vitro and in vivo conditions employing human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), mouse mammary gland adenocarcinoma cells (4T1), and 4T1-Luc tumor-bearing mouse models. The findings demonstrated that GO(OX)PB (1/1/0.2) NPs (+L) were highly effective in causing significant cytotoxicity, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis, and photothermal effect. This resulted in a greater percentage of cell death compared to free OX, GO(OX)PEG (1/1/0.2) NPs (±L), and GO(OX)PB (1/1/0.2) NPs (-L). The in vivo therapeutic studies on 4T1-Luc tumor-bearing mice revealed that a combination of GO(OX)PB (1/1/0.2) NPs (+L) caused complete disappearance of the tumor, no tumor recurrence, prolonged survival, reduced lung metastasis, and mitigated nephrotoxicity. The serum and blood analysis demonstrated minimal systemic toxicity of GO(OX)PB (1/1/0.2) NPs. The developed nanoplatform, in this context, may serve as a potential nanomedicine to address conventional nephrotoxicity in breast cancer and prevent metastasis by combining chemo-photothermal therapy.",
