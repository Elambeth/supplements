      "abstract": "The integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS)-enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) (IFAS-EBPR) system is significant for its ability to enhance nitrification and phosphorus removal by leveraging fixed-film carriers for nitrifiers and suspended growth for heterotrophs, but limited understanding of microbial dynamics and variable performance continues to drive interest in optimizing its application. This study investigated the key factors that affect the distribution and abundance of denitrifying (DPAOs) and non-denitrifying types of Accumulibacter-like polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (non-DPAOs) in a lab-scale continuous-flow IFAS-EBPR. The increase of nitrate recycles ratios from 1.0, 1.5, to 2.5Q affected both nitrogen (N) removal efficiency and EBPR activities, with P removal profile transitioning from having continuous P release to P uptake in anoxic zone. Population abundance analysis revealed that Clade I Accumulibacter (preconceived DPAO-Accumulibacter clade) correlated positively with the nitrate recycle flows (r = 0.96) and anoxic residual nitrate concentration (r = 0.99), while Clade II Accumulibacter (non-DPAO clade) showed negative correlation (r = -0.93), indicating the response of DPAO to the operational condition, particularly the nitrate recycle ratio, in our system. Furthermore, the relative abundance of DPAOs correlated  negatively with the anoxic residual biodegradable COD (r = -0.99), anoxic hydraulic retention time (HRT) (r = -0.99), and nitrate and nitrite levels in the anoxic zone (r = -0.95, -0.99). SUMO model simulations revealed DPAO denitrification rates of 8.2, 7.8, and 4.1 gN/m3/d from 1.0, 1.5, to 2.5Q, accounting for only 5.8%, 9.5%, and 4.0% of nitrate removal in the anoxic zone, respectively. This study demonstrates that DPAO and non-DPAO populations are dynamically affected by operating conditions in a continuous-flow EBPR system, and the actual contribution of DPAO to the overall denitrification is relatively small (<10%). This study contributed to our better understanding of DPAO population dynamics and providing insights for optimizing DPAO in a EBPR processes for more sustainable wastewater treatment. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Accumulibacter-like DPAO subgroups and non-DPAOs coexist in IFAS-EBPR systems, with abundances controlled by nitrate recycle flows. DPAOs contribute <10% to overall denitrification, but their enrichment significantly impacts carbon reduction in EBPR processes. Optimizing nitrate recycle ratio (around 1.5) balances nitrate recycling and oxygen inhibition, enhancing DPAO performance in wastewater treatment. Understanding DPAO subpopulation dynamics is crucial for designing efficient BNR systems with reduced external carbon requirements.",

      "abstract": "Inoculating functional bacterial strains is a cost-effective strategy for enhancing treatment of anaerobic digestion liquids in swine wastewater. This study systematically evaluated inoculation of heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification strain Acinetobacter indicus CZH-5 in an internal circulation airlift zeolite sphere-based sequencing batch reactor (IR) for aerobic removal of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and tetracycline (TEC). Inoculation with CZH-5 promoted secretion of quorum sensing signaling molecules, specifically N-acyl-homoserine lactones (C6-HSL and C10-HSL). These signaling molecules enhance quorum sensing and reinforce cooperation among functional bacteria. Under optimal conditions, average removal efficiencies of total nitrogen, total phosphate, and TEC were 92.8 %, 88.4 %, and 93.1 %, respectively. The removal performance in IR exceeded that of the control by 26 %-71 %. N removal involved complete nitrification-denitrification, while accumulated P was transformed into phosphate monoesters within biofilm. Metagenomic analysis identified Thauera and Acinetobacter as the dominant genera, and Acinetobacter indicus as predominant species. Inoculation enhanced microbial richness and diversity to improve system operational stability. The abundance of functional genes associated with N, P, and TEC transformations significantly increased compared to the control. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of inoculating a heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification strain into an aerated biofilm system for swine wastewater remediation."

      "abstract": "Five large-scale treatment wetlands, the Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs), have been constructed in south Florida to reduce phosphorus (P) transport into the Florida Everglades. While the STAs have successfully reduced P entering downstream waterbodies by at least 77%, concentrations in outflow waters still exceed target values in many cases. It has been well documented that P compounds have varying effects on biotic and abiotic processes due to differing stability, bioavailability, and transport characteristics, making it critical to understand the nature of different P pools for improving long-term treatment wetland performance. Here, we used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy and P X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to characterize P in surface water particulates entering and leaving the STAs. The most abundant P component at the inflows, as determined via 31P NMR, was orthophosphate (∼36% of P). XANES analyses of inflow waters indicated a lack of iron (Fe)-P bonds and suggested the presence of organic P. Though not commonly documented in this magnitude, polyphosphates were detected in all samples, ranging up to 39% at the outflows. Very little orthophosphate was detected at the outflows, while XANES analysis indicated the presence of hydroxyapatite in STA-2, suggesting internal transformation processes within the wetland. These findings suggest that outflow particulate P may be largely biogenic and that inorganic P may be apatitic in nature, as seen in STA-2. While STA research is relevant for Everglades ecosystem health, the approaches addressed here are informative for treatment wetland research and stormwater P management globally."

      "abstract": "This study developed a novel wastewater treatment process for efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal using micron zeolite powder carriers and hydrocyclone separator. Under anaerobic/intermittent aeration, the total nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies reached 85.2 ± 1.9 % and 78.9 ± 3.4 %, respectively, significantly outperforming conventional activated sludge system. High specific surface area and porosity of zeolite powder facilitated microbial aggregation and biofilm formation, resulting in an average sludge size of 125.3 ± 5.3 μm. The combination of powder carriers and hydrocyclone separators resulted in the differentiated distribution of functional microorganisms. Denitrifying bacteria, such as norank_Comamonadaceae (4.34 %), norank_AKYH767 (1.90 %), and Candidatus_Microthrix (2.61 %), were enriched in biofilm, while nitrifying bacteria and polyphosphate-accumulating organisms predominated in floc. Functional gene abundance related to denitrification and phosphorus removal was significantly upregulated. Correlation network analysis revealed enhanced microbial cooperation, improving the functionality and stability of community. This study offers the potential pathway for efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal from municipal wastewater."

      "abstract": "Rationale: In the reconstruction of diabetic bone defects, 3D-printed scaffolds often encounter the challenge of limited and delayed tissue ingrowth in their central regions, which is critical for successful osseointegration and prognostic outcomes. Hyperglycemia induces endothelial apoptosis and impedes angiogenesis, thus inhibiting osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). Methods: Drawing inspiration from the growth pattern of vines, we developed a Zn@BP/Si coating on the 3D-printed titanium scaffold to promote the coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis. This coating was achieved by Zn2+-modified black phosphorus (BP), which not only enhances the stability and photothermal properties of BP, but also prevents endothelial apoptosis. The effectiveness of Zn@BP/Si in the reconstruction of diabetic bone defects was investigated in rat model of diabetic femoral defect. Its effect on osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling has also been explored in BMSCs and HUVECs. Results: Zn@BP/Si regulated mitochondrial dynamics and provided motivation for cell adhesion and migration, just like the climbing of vines. Notably, the regulation of enzymatic activity plays a crucial role in its inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fission. The results demonstrate that the Zn@BP/Si promotes the growth of \"vascular vines\" and ameliorates the angiogenic and osteogenic inhibition in diabetes. Conclusions: The study reveals the potential of bio-inspired Zn@BP/Si coating in angiogenesis-osteogenesis coupling and the treatment of diabetic bone defects.",

Seventy-eight patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment for ≥6 mo were collected. General information and anthropometric and blood biochemical indices were recorded, including gender, age, body mass index, mid-arm muscle circumference, albumin, intact parathyroid hormone, and Ca and P product (Ca×P). The severity of vascular calcification was graded. The correlation between the severity of vascular calcification in patients and each of the clinical indicators was analyzed. The diagnostic value of Ca and P metabolism and microinflammatory factors for vascular calcification in malnourished uremic patients was assessed. All enrolled patients were divided into a non-vascular calcification group (n=42) and a vascular calcification group (n=36) according to coronary artery calcification (CAC) scoring, and the probability of vascular calcification was 46%. The dialysis duration, Ca×P, P, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were significantly higher in the vascular calcification group than in the non-vascular calcification group. hs-CRP, IL-6, Ca×P, and P had predictive potency for vascular calcification in patients. CAC scores were correlated positively with hs-CRP, IL-6, Ca×P, and P. Malnourished uremic patients have a higher incidence of vascular calcification. hs-CRP, IL-6, Ca×P, and P are all independent risk factors for vascular calcification in uremic patients, and are positively correlated with the severity of vascular calcification.",

      "abstract": "The contribution of dissolved phosphorus (P) from tile drain systems in agricultural lands is significant, leading to water impairment and promoting algae bloom development in water bodies. Hence, there is an urgent need for sustainable and efficient technology, such as absorbent material, that can effectively remove P at low concentrations in these systems. This study aimed to evaluate fiber extraction from corn leaves and its potential for reducing dissolved P. Corn fibers were extracted from corn leaves using alkali treatment by varying the concentration of sodium hydroxide (5-15%w/w), extraction temperature (85-95°C), and time (60-120 min Results of the alkali extraction showed that the highest fiber recovery of 45.18 ± 0.39% g g-1 was achieved at 10% NaOH at 85°C for 60 min condition. To enhance the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the extracted corn fibers, kaolinite clay (0-30% w/w) and calcium carbonate (0-50% w/w) were incorporated into the leaf fiber. Adsorption tests revealed that corn leaf fiber alone reduced phosphate concentration by 8.75 ± 1.49% within 60 minutes. However, when enhanced with 30% w/w kaolinite clay and 35% w/w calcium carbonate, the phosphate concentration in the solution decreased by 79.40 ± 11.90%. Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis confirmed the presence of phosphorus in the enhanced adsorbent material following treatment. This study demonstrates the potential of enhancing agricultural wastes like corn leaf fiber as a low-cost alternative for phosphorus removal in agricultural tile drain systems that can later disposed of as fertilizer in a circular economy scheme. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Corn leaf fiber, extracted using alkali treatment, shows potential as a sustainable, low-cost adsorbent material for phosphorus removal Enhancing corn leaf fiber with kaolinite clay and calcium carbonate significantly improves phosphate reduction Converting agricultural waste like corn leaf as adsorbent material can help manage phosphorus levels in agricultural tile drains.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Phosphorus, an essential mineral with diverse biological functions, has recently garnered attention for its potential role in modulating the immune system. However, no study is present regarding the effect of homoepthic preparation of Phosphorus on immune system. Thus, this study aims to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of Phosphorus, shedding light on its impact on Normal and Immunosuppressive conditions in mice. METHODS: The immunomodulatory effect of Phosphorus 6C, 30C, and 200C was tested using Sheep red blood cells on humoral antibody titer and delayed-type hypersensitivity assays. The effect of Phosphorus was investigated in cyclophosphamide induced immune-compromised mice by assessing hematology, organ index, phagocytic index, histology, cytokine level, and their mRNA expression in the spleen. RESULTS: Phosphorus 6C produced a significant increase in the primary and secondary humoral immune response. While Phosphorus treatment at 6C, 30C, and 200C did not significantly alter hematological and organ index parameters, it considerably enhance the phagocytic index at 30C and 200C, and raise the levels of TNF-α and IL-2 in mice against immunosuppression induced by CPM after the pretreatment with Phosphorus-30C. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that Phosphorus 6C potency augment the humoral immunity. In case of immunosuppression, Phosphorus at high dilution might play a significant role but more research is needed to find out the possible effect of Phosphorus preparation."

It has commonly been assumed that recovery with artificial inputs would be quicker and more efficient. However, is this truly the situation? We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the differences and applicability between ecological restoration and ecological rehabilitation. Relationships between soil phosphorus content, plant diversity, and soil microbial diversity were analyzed using 463 valid experimental data points collected from 72 publications. The results indicated that in grassland ecosystems, ecological restoration outperformed rehabilitation by 35%, 68%, 38%, and 48% in belowground biomass, community coverage, plant richness, and Shannon diversity, respectively. In forests, rehabilitation trailed behind restoration by 58%, 26%, and 92% in belowground biomass, Simpson diversity, and bacterial Shannon diversity. Furthermore, there was minimal difference in the recovery mode among different fungal and bacterial phyla. Rehabilitation demonstrated lower stability and efficiency in long-term phosphorus cycling compared to restoration. Overall, ecological restoration offers more stable and efficient long-term phosphorus cycling, thereby questioning the effectiveness of ecological rehabilitation for sustainable ecosystem recovery, especially for species diversity and phosphorus cycling."

      "abstract": "Human activities have increased the imbalance in atmospheric N and P deposition, which changes soil nutrient availability and subsequently affects the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. Dioecious plants are important parts of terrestrial ecosystems and are characterized by sex-related differences in their response to the external environment and always exhibit a skewed sex ratio, which makes them more vulnerable to climate change and increases their risk of extinction. However, little attention has been paid to the effects of unbalanced N and P deposition on these plants, especially on their defense traits. In this study, we used dioecious Populus cathayana to investigate the influence of gradient N and P deposition on the correlation between growth and defense traits. The results showed that although the different rates of N and P deposition enhanced biomass accumulation in both sexes to varying degrees, the most substantial biomass increment was noted under a lower-nitrogen and higher-phosphorus (LNHP) treatment regimen, with females showing an approximately 112% increase and males a 47% increase in total biomass. In response to varying levels of simulated N and P deposition, males and females adopt distinct strategies for biomass allocation. Although declines in root biomass were observed in both sexes as nutrient availability increased, the decrement was more marked in males; under the LNHP treatment, it dropped by about 11%, while under a high-nitrogen and high-phosphorus (HNHP) treatment, the decrease was about 35%. Conversely, females demonstrated a heightened propensity to allocate biomass towards leaf development. Furthermore, with increasing N and P deposition, there was a general reduction in the concentrations of physical and chemical defense substances within the leaves of both sexes. Nonetheless, the correlations between defense substances, nutrient element content, non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) content, and dry biomass were more pronounced in males, suggesting a greater sensitivity to defense substance responses in males than in females. Overall, these results indicate that there is sexual dimorphism in the accumulation of chemical substances in male and female P. cathayana under unbalanced N and P deposition and they provide a technical and theoretical basis for predicting the population dynamics of dioecious plants, maintaining the stability of poplar populations, and constructing high-productivity poplar plantations globally in the future."

Due to over-excavation and ecological damage, the wild resources of F. taipaiensis have suffered serious damage. Understanding and improving the inter-root soil environment plays an important role in improving the success rate of artificial cultivation of F. taipaiensis and the quality of medicinal herbs. METHODS: This study employed a pot experiment to inoculate three strains of phosphorus-solubilizing fungi from the Aspergillus genus for a total of seven treatment groups, with sterile physiological saline serving as the control group (CK). The research aims to examine the impact of inoculating phosphorus-solubilizing fungi on the biomass of F. taipaiensis, alkaloid concentration in its bulbs, and characteristics of the rhizosphere soil environment. The specific inoculation treatments included: Aspergillus tubingensis (Z1); Aspergillus niger (Z2); Aspergillus fumigatus (Z3); a combination of A. tubingensis and A. niger (Z12); a combination of A. niger and A. fumigatus (Z13); a combination of A. tubingensis and A. fumigatus (Z23); and a combination of all three fungi, A. tubingensis, A. niger, and A. fumigatus (Z123). RESULTS: Inoculation with phosphorus-soluble fungi significantly increased the biomass of F. taipaiensis, and the largest increase was in the Z123 group, which was 62.85% higher than that of the CK group. Total alkaloid content increased the most (0.11%) in the Z3 group, which was an 83.87% increase compared with the CK group. The total content of monomer alkaloids in the Z3, Z13, and Z123 groups increased by 10.53%, 12.48%, and 9.61%, respectively, compared with those in the CK group, indicating that the quality of F. taipaiensis could be significantly improved after applying phosphorus-solubilizing fungi. The soil environment improved after inoculation with different phosphorus-solubilizing fungi. The Z23 and Z123 groups had the greatest effect on the rhizosphere soil bacteria and Actinomyces. Overall, the soil nutrient content of the Z13 group increased the most, and the contents of available phosphorus, available potassium, available nitrogen, total phosphorus, and organic matter increased by 47.71%, 27.36%, 26.78%, 25.13%, and 31.72%, respectively, compared with those in the CK group. CONCLUSION: These results show that the treatment groups that included different combinations of strains were superior to the single-strain treatment groups, and the Z123 group was the best treatment group when considering bulb biomass and alkaloid and soil nutrient contents.

      "abstract": "Repair and regeneration of oral and maxillofacial tissue defects remain significant challenges, mainly due to the limitations of existing treatment approaches. Conventional methods such as transplantation, tissue scaffolds, growth factors, and stem cell therapies often face obstacles, including donor shortages, insufficient vascularization, and safety concerns. There is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies to effectively promote vascular regeneration while minimizing complications. Black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) and hydrogels present significant advantages and broad application potential as tissue regeneration carriers due to their biocompatibility, degradability, and controlled drug release properties. By combining various characterization techniques and detection methods, we conducted a thorough analysis of BPNSs and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) scaffolds loaded with BPNSs (BP-GelMA). The results indicate that this study successfully prepared BPNSs with uniform size, good dispersion, and intact structure. Moreover, the BP-GelMA composite demonstrated excellent swelling behavior and structural stability while effectively enabling the controlled release of BPNSs. This study investigated the angiogenic effects of BP-GelMA at concentrations of 0, 12.5, and 25.0 μg/mL. In vitro experiments showed that BP-GelMA significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. In vivo results demonstrated that 12.5 μg/mL and 25.0 μg/mL BP-GelMA did not induce significant developmental toxicity in zebrafish and effectively promoted neovascularization. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that BP-GelMA activates angiogenesis-related biological processes. Mechanistic studies identified PEAK1 as a central regulator, driving vascular formation through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. These findings highlight the potential of BP-GelMA as a therapeutic strategy for promoting angiogenesis and underscore the importance of optimizing BP-GelMA concentrations to achieve maximum therapeutic efficacy and safety in clinical applications."

      "abstract": "As a type of two-dimensional nanomaterial, black phosphorus (BP) has attracted considerable interest for applications in various fields. Despite its advantages, including biodegradability and biocompatibility, recent studies have shown that BP exhibits cytotoxicity in different types of cells. However, no studies have investigated the effects of BP exposure during pregnancy. Herein, we first investigated the effect of gestational exposure to BP nanoparticles (BPNPs) in a mouse model. Our findings indicated that BPNPs exposure restricted fetal growth and hindered placental development. In HTR8/SVneo trophoblast cells, BPNPs inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and caused apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, BPNPs induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and extensive mitochondrial damage. We further demonstrated that BPNPs promoted mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway. Parkin siRNA knockdown rescued BPNPs-induced trophoblast dysfunction, while ROS inhibition attenuated BPNPs-induced cytotoxicity by reducing mitochondrial damage. Finally, treatment with mdivi-1, a mitophagy inhibitor, mitigated mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, excessive mtROS production, and the resulting trophoblast dysfunction. In vivo model investigation indicated that the application of mdivi-1 ameliorated embryonic resorption and fetal growth by alleviating placental damage. In summary, gestational exposure to BPNPs impairs fetal growth by inducing placental trophoblast dysfunction through ROS-regulated, PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy."

      "abstract": "Foxtail millet performance under low phosphorus (P) is determined by growth potential, with tiller number as a key indicator. Yield is influenced by P dilution rather than total P concentration. Foxtail millet, renowned for its high nutrient content and drought resilience, faces limited breeding investment despite being cultivated in vulnerable agri-systems. Low phosphorus (P) levels affect approximately 50% of global agricultural soils, and particularly impact regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, the latter where foxtail millet is extensively grown. This study explores the effects of low P (< 5 ppm; Hedley Fractionation Method; Cross and Schlesinger 1995) on foxtail millet plant growth and yield-related traits, utilizing high-throughput platforms (HTP) with a selected subset of genotypes (n = 10) from the core collection of ICRISAT Genebank. Results uncover substantial variation in plant growth and agronomical traits at both treatment and genotype levels. Under low-P conditions, genotypic variation is noted, with a sixfold difference in tiller count, 2.4-fold in grain yield, 2.7-fold in 3D-leaf area, and 2.3-fold in root surface area. A significant relationship was found between grain yield under low-P and high-P conditions (R2 = 0.65; P < 0.01). This suggests that genetic yield potential (vigor) under high-P conditions strongly influences grain yield and tiller numbers under low-P conditions. Residual grain yield under low-P conditions, not explained by high-P conditions, had a strong positive association with tiller numbers (R2 = 0.70; P < 0.01) and showed a significant negative association with total P concentration (R2 = 0.54; P < 0.05). Conversely, under high-P conditions, grain yield (GY_LF) from Lysi-Field exhibited significant positive correlations with P use efficiency (PUE) (r = 0.94; P < 0.001) and total biomass (r = 0.84; P < 0.01). These findings underscore the critical role of P availability in influencing grain yield and related traits. Under low-P conditions, performance is primarily driven by growth potential, with tiller number serving as a reliable marker of this potential. The significant genotypic variation observed highlights the importance of selecting for growth-related traits in P-limited environments. In addition, P dilution, rather than total P concentration, appears to play a key role in determining yield under low P. Optimizing P management strategies and breeding for improved growth potential may significantly enhance crop performance in regions facing P limitation.",

This study evaluated the effects of aluminum sulfate supplementation in the close-up diet to reduce blood phosphorus levels and prevent postpartum hypocalcemia. Thirty-four cows were assigned to the Control (CTRL, n = 17) and Treatment (TRT, n = 17) groups. The TRT group received 400 g/cow/day of aluminum sulfate at least 14 days before calving, with identical post-calving diets. Blood samples were analyzed for total and ionized calcium (tCa, iCa), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Milk yields were recorded. TRT cows had 0.22, 0.18, and 0.14 mmol/L higher tCa levels than CTRL cows at 12 h, 1 d, and 2 d postpartum, respectively, with elevated iCa levels from 10 days prepartum to 3 days postpartum. Lower serum P levels were observed in TRT cows until day 2 postpartum, while Mg levels remained similar. BHB levels differed only on day 14 postpartum. These findings suggest that aluminum sulfate supplementation effectively lowers serum P and increases tCa, offering a promising strategy for hypocalcemia prevention in dairy cows."

Understanding these effects is essential for predicting ecosystem resilience and promoting forest health under environmental change. Herein, we investigated the P status in two tree and two herb species and their rhizosphere soils after 12 years of acid treatment at three pH levels (pH: 4.0, 3.5, and 3.0) in a tropical forest in Southern China. We found that leaf, litter, and root P; leaf N and P resorption efficiency; and their ratios remained stable in trees; however, herb leaf and litter P levels declined. Acid addition reduced inorganic P in tree rhizosphere soil and inorganic and organic P in herb rhizosphere soil. Rhizosphere soil P fractions were more regulated by soil physicochemical properties and less regulated by microbial community in trees than in herbs. Under long-term simulated acid rain, stable tree P status benefited from soil inorganic P depletion, and herbs partially met their P requirements via biological mineralization of soil organic P. These distinct P-associated responses and acquisition strategies provide insights into safeguarding forest health among plants of different functional types under long-term acid rain events.",

      "abstract": "Efficient management of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is imperative for sustainable agriculture, resource conservation, and reducing environmental pollution. Despite progress in on-farm practices and urban wastewater treatment in the Chesapeake Bay (CB) watershed, limited attention has been given to nutrient transport, use, and handling between farms and urban environments. This study uses the hierarchical CAFE (Cropping system, Animal-crop system, Food system, and Ecosystem) framework to evaluate nutrient management performances within the watershed. We first develop a three-decade, county-level nutrient budget database (1985-2019), then analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of N and P budgets, as well as N and P use efficiencies, within the four CAFE hierarchies. Our results indicate a sizable increase in potential N and P losses beyond crop fields (i.e. in the Animal-crop system, Food system, and Ecosystem), surpassing losses from cropland in over 90% of counties. To address these system-wide trade-offs, we estimate the nutrient resources in waste streams beyond croplands, which, if recovered and recycled, could theoretically offset mineral fertilizer inputs in over 60% of counties. Additionally, the growing imbalance in excess N versus P across systems, which increases the N:P ratio of potential losses, could pose an emerging risk to downstream aquatic ecosystems. By utilizing a systematic approach, our novel application of the CAFE framework reveals trade-offs and synergies in nutrient management outcomes that transcend agro-environmental and political boundaries, underscores disparities in N and P management, and helps to identify unique opportunities for enhancing holistic nutrient management across systems within the CB watershed."

      "abstract": "Phosphorus is essential for global food production, but intensive agriculture disrupts its natural cycle, increasing reliance on non-renewable sources. A sustainable alternative is recovering phosphorus from waste streams using thermochemical processes. This work investigates the hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge digestate to explore phosphorus conversion and speciation, aiming to optimize solid by-product as fertilizer. Through a novel integration of response surface methodology and process severity modeling, the study examines the influence of process parameters (temperature, time) on phosphorus behavior. A sewage sludge digestate, sampled from a wastewater treatment plant, was treated in a batch reactor at temperatures from 250 to 350 °C for 5-45 min. Products were centrifuged into a solid pellet and process water, followed by characterization of their physicochemical properties. Results show that temperature and time significantly impact by-product characteristics and phosphorus speciation. Treatments at 250-300 °C promote organic phosphorus mineralization and increase soluble phosphate concentration, while treatments at 350 °C lead to greater phosphorus recovery in the solid pellet, mostly as calcium phosphates. This research provides a framework for sustainable phosphorus recovery, suggesting hydrothermally treated pellets as potential slow-release fertilizers. Future work should comprehensively investigate the effect of calcium addition on phosphorus precipitation as calcium phosphates.",

      "abstract": "Dry cultivation of rice (DCR) is one of the important rice cultivation practices aimed at addressing freshwater resource shortages. However, the non-renewable nature of phosphate resources constrains agricultural development. In the context of the contradiction between rice, water, and phosphorus, there is little research on using the silicon phosphorus relationship to improve the phosphorus availability and uptake of DCR. This experiment used field soil and established five fertilization treatments: no phosphorus application, low phosphorus and normal phosphorus (0, 25, 75 kg·ha-1 P2O5) (0P, 25P, 75P), along with two silicon levels (0, 45kg·ha-1 SiO2), resulting in the treatments 0P, 0PSi, 25P, 25PSi, and 75P. The soil phosphorus components and plant phosphorus uptake were analyzed. The results showed that adding silicon to 25P increased the Olsen-P content (14.37%) by increasing Ca8-P (9.04%) and Al-P (19.31%). Additionally, root and leaf phosphorus content increased by 7.6% and 5.8%, respectively, comparable to the levels observed in the 75P treatment. On one hand, adding silicon increases malate (40.48%) and succinate (49.73%) content, enhances acid phosphatase activity, and increases the abundance of Bradyrhizobium, Paenibacillus, and Bacillus, as well as the proportion of Fusarium, forming an \"organic acid microbial\" activated phosphorus system. On the other hand, the addition of silicon alleviated phosphorus limitations by reducing ATP consumption in roots through a decrease in ATPase and P-ATPase content. This also minimized excessive NSC transport to roots, thereby promoting shoot growth by downregulating SUT1, SWEET11, SUS2, and CIN2. In addition to optimizing root-to-shoot ratio and providing sufficient energy, silicon addition also increases root volume and upregulates OsPT2, OsPT4, and OsPT8, thereby promoting phosphorus uptake. In summary, 25PSi optimizes the root-to-shoot ratio and promotes phosphorus conversion and uptake through organic acid, microbial, and energy pathways. Applying silicon is beneficial for the sustainable and efficient management of phosphorus in DCR."

To date, the treatment of ischemic stroke is limited, and its consequent ischemia-reperfusion injury is an important reason for this result. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory storm followed by ischemia-reperfusion alter the microenvironment of cerebral ischemic penumbra, leading to the devastating damage to the brain. Herein, we design a black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) loaded with magnesium ions (Mg2+) and polydopamine (PBP@Mg) to tackle the above problems. BPNSs of PBP@Mg effectively scavenge excessive ROS in neurocytes. Mg2+ plays an anti-inflammatory role in ischemic penumbra. Furthermore, polydopamine improves the stability of BPNSs. PBP@Mg is subsequently injected into the lateral ventricle of a rat model of ischemic stroke, resulting in an improvement of the ischemic microenvironment and a reduction in ischemic volume. BPNSs of PBP@Mg counteract against the excessive generation of ROS and the neuronal apoptosis in ischemic penumbra. Meanwhile, PBP@Mg dramatically suppresses inflammation by promoting the transformation of microglia from M1 to M2 in ischemic penumbra. PBP@Mg group exhibit a significantly better performance in neurofunctional behavior compared to ischemic group. Taken together, this study provides a novel therapeutic approach for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects."

      "abstract": "Recovering phosphorus from mainstream wastewater treatment systems by leveraging microbial metabolism without the addition of extra chemicals effectively streamlines the steps involved in phosphorus recovery from low-strength wastewater, thereby increasing the economic feasibility of the phosphorus recovery process. Hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca5(PO4)3OH) can be formed directly via bioinduction in biological treatment systems, serving as a potential substitute for phosphate rock. HAP formation in sewage with low phosphate and Ca2+ concentrations is challenging. Denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (DPAOs) can regulate phosphate ions and pH to facilitate HAP formation in sewage. In this study, the denitrifying biological phosphorus removal (DPR) system was established, achieving phosphorus and nitrate removal efficiencies of 99.3 % and 45.1 %, respectively. In the anaerobic and anoxic sections, the saturation index for HAP was greater than zero, indicating favourable conditions for HAP formation. Inorganic cores, identified as HAP through chemical composition and structural features, were formed in the DPR granular sludge, contributing approximately 66 % to phosphorus removal. The HAP‒DPR granular sludge, located at the bottom of the reactor, consisted of 80 wt % inorganic matter and 15.4 wt % total phosphorus, 86.1 % of which was chemical phosphorus precipitation. Microstructural analysis of HAP cores revealed poly-pellet structures with nanoscale wires. The growth of HAP minerals was not inhibited by intracellular polyphosphates. The presence of HAP cores promoted a differentiated spatial distribution of granular sludge and contributed to a differentiated microbial community structure. DPAOs were located mainly in small-sized granular sludge (Type A), whereas denitrifying glycogen-accumulating organisms were found mainly in large-sized granular sludge (Type B), where HAP formation primarily occurred. Granular sludge with higher inorganic and chemical phosphorus contents (Type C) likely originated from the disintegration of Type B. In conclusion, the HAP‒DPR system has potential for phosphorus recovery in the form of HAP directly from low-strength wastewater."

      "abstract": "Alleviating cadmium (Cd) risk in paddy soils is a global research hotspot. Although biochar reduces Cd mobility, a holistic perspective on the effects of biochar on Cd fraction distribution in rice rhizosphere and its immobilization mechanisms is lacking. Here, we developed a pathway model that links soil physicochemical properties, IP formation, enzyme activity, microbial biomass, porewater nutrients, and soil Cd fractions to fill knowledge gaps. Results revealed that phosphorus-loaded magnetic biochar (PMLB) application increased soil pH, available phosphorus (AP), total phosphorus (TP), microbial biomass, and TP and Fe contents in porewater while inhibiting soil enzyme activities. Compared with the control, 0.2 %-1 % w/w PMLB treatment reduced soil acetic acid-extractable Cd (Aci-Cd) content during the tillering, filling, and maturity periods by 23.71-32.92 %, 25.45-37.33 %, and 7.39-18.40 %, respectively.

Soil microbial biomass contributed most to reducing Cd content in rice tissues (total path coefficient: -0.48), followed by enzyme activity and IP. Additionally, PMLB promoted IP formation and altered the immobilization methods of Cd by IP, from coprecipitation with iron (hydr)oxides and phosphate to ternary complex formation with phosphate as a bridge to band Cd and iron (hydr)oxides."

In this study, we designed a nanovaccine that combined PTT and immunotherapy for tumors using two-dimensional black phosphorus (BP) as a nanoplatform that was modified with maleimide poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-MAL) and coated with tumor antigen proteins (BP-PEG-MAL@antigen). The BP-PEG-MAL@antigen nanovaccines displayed outstanding stability and biocompatibility due to the comodification of PEG and antigen proteins. The nanovaccines induced strong immune responses in vitro and in vivo that effectively inhibited orthotopic and bilateral tumor growth, prolonged survival time, and improved the survival rate of mice. In addition, the nanovaccines generated a long-term immune response and effectively inhibited tumor recurrence.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Applying animal effluent/digestate to forage crops can improve the sustainability of intensive livestock husbandry. Organic phosphorus (P) forms, in particular phytic acid (InsP6) present in animal effluent/digestate, would benefit from an effective uptake and assimilation by crops thus representing an alternative to mineral P fertilization and controlling P losses in water system. A maize (Zea mays L.) traditional Italian population (VA572), bred before the widespread diffusion of crop chemical fertilization, and a modern commercial hybrid (P1547) were used in this study to investigate their ability of growing in soilless medium using phytic acid (Po) vs phosphate P (Pi) as P sources in a 28-day experiment. The hypothesis was that the different agronomical context in which the two varieties were selected could have brought to different abilities in exploiting P sources for plant growth. RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative growth parameters, root enzymatic phosphatase activities and root transcriptome by RNA-seq analysis were analyzed in this study. Both maize populations were able to grow using phytic acid as the sole P source but organic P utilization was less efficient than Pi; a significant root-released phytase activity, induced by the presence of InsP6, was detected in Po treatment. The RNA-seq analysis showed different expression patterns induced by organic P treatment (Po) in the two populations. The upregulation in Po treatment of a Purple Acid Phosphatase (PAP) gene and of genes involved in inositol transport indicate that both phosphate hydrolysis from InsP6 by root-secreted PAPs and a direct uptake of myo-inositol at various degrees of phosphorylation could be involved in maize phytic acid exploitation. Root system development and the relationship of P sources with other macro and micro nutrient uptake (N, K, metal ions) were also implied in the response to Po treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that phytic acid is a bioavailable P source for maize seedling growth. A wider mobilization of genes/pathways was induced by Po treatment in VA572 with respect to P1547 hybrid. The physiological responses to Po treatment were similar in both populations but the patterns of genes involved often differed being specific to each one.",

However, previous studies focused on bacteria cultures for biological treatment, overlooking the potential of algae-bacteria co-growth and its possible effects on enhancing mineralization. Thus, this study replicated those experiments under conditions that promote algal growth. Synthetic OSPW underwent photocatalytic pre-treatment for varying durations, followed by biological treatment in illuminated microcosms. Biostimulation, through phosphate addition, was also tested to determine its effect on accelerating mineralization. Photocatalytic pre-treatments of 24 h or longer created oligotrophic conditions, triggering the production of algal-derived organics, which released nutrients into the water and reduced mineralization rates during the biological treatment phase. Moreover, nutrient addition generally exacerbated these effects by promoting photosynthetic biomass growth. Nutrient-fixing and symbiotic microbes were identified, contributing to prolonged organic production phases. These phases of persistent organic generation could pose a risk of eutrophication, highlighting the need to mitigate light exposure during post-biological treatments. Under controlled light exposure, BPCs with biological treatments offer a scalable, energy-efficient solution for addressing complex industrial wastewater challenges, advancing the sustainable management of OSPW and similar hard-to-treat water sources.",

After Chlorella sp. cultured for 16 days, the concentration of phosphorus decreased from 12.76 mg/L to 5.00 mg/L. There were two ways to reduce phosphorus by Chlorella sp. One was the specific uptakes phosphorus into algal cells and the other was absorbs phosphorus through the functional groups on the EPS.

Characterization results showed that steam treatment contributed to generate mesopores with pore sizes of 2-3 nm and 10-20 nm, while progressive aggregation of phosphorus species on the exterior surface resulted in blockage of channels. Dealumination of framework aluminum led to a gradual decline in total acidity and acid strength with an increase of steam temperature or P/Al ratio. Sufficient strong acid sites and enhanced accessibility to the inner active sites were crucial factors in conversion of ethylene to liquid fuels. The steam modified sample at 700 °C (HZ-700) obtained the highest yield of liquid fuels up to 78.1%, which demonstrated an increase of 40% in comparison with the unmodified sample. Due to improved diffusional capacity originating from mesopores, HZ-700 showed a higher deactivation stability than the phosphorus modified sample at similar conversion levels. This work will provide some insight into the development of zeolite-based catalyst for ethylene oligomerization to liquid fuels."

Separation trials at varying concentrations and treatment times were performed in a laboratory setting.

P fractionation revealed that metal ions promoted the formation of non-labile P, reducing nutrient run off and improving long-term nutrient availability.

This study developed a full-scale, non-membrane, multi-stage anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (MSA2O) biofilm reactor integrated with horizontal-vertical flow constructed wetlands (HVCWs), which was operated continuously for approximately 320 days with an average flow of 11.9 m3/d in a rural area of northern China. Key parameters were optimized: hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 21-32 h, aeration rate of 4.0 m3/h, carbon source dosing at 1.25 L/h, PAC dosing at 0.55 L/h, and mixed liquor reflux ratio at 200 %. The system demonstrated high removal efficiencies for COD (74.2 %), NH4+-N (93.4 %), TN (90.6 %), and TP (86.3 %), consistently meeting the class 1A of GB18918-2002, China (COD ≤50 mg/L, NH4+-N ≤ 5 mg/L, TN ≤ 15 mg/L, TP ≤ 0.5 mg/L), even under challenging conditions such as low C/N (3.3) and rainy seasons. More than 70 % of nitrogen and phosphorus were removed in the MSA2O system. Microbial analysis revealed the enrichment of many functional bacteria. Proteobacteria play a key role in denitrification and phosphorus removal. Actinomycetes, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes to nitrogen fixation and organic matter degradation. Nitrosomonas dominated ammonia oxidation, while Dechloromonas and Accumulibacter significantly contributed to phosphorus uptake. Seasonal variations in microbial diversity enabled consistent and highly efficient nutrient removal. The HVCWs system contributed 16.3 % of total phosphorus removal through selected plant species and phosphorus-absorbing modified ceramsite, ensuring effluent polishing and stability. With low operational costs ($0.12/m3), the integrated system provides an effective and scalable solution for rural wastewater treatment, delivering high-quality effluent with minimal energy consumption.",

Fermentation-enhanced EBPR (F-EBPR) processes have shown promise in addressing these limitations, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study investigates the metabolism of higher order (C4-5) volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in F-EBPR systems using a combination of carbon isotope labelling and shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses. Results show that butyrate (HBu) uptake leads to the formation of both typical (C4-5) and atypical (C6+) polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) through a combination ofβ-oxidation and standard condensation pathways, while the putative role of HBu oxidisers were identified relative to substrate composition in F-EBPR processes. Metagenomic analysis reveals the presence of genes required for higher order VFA metabolism in both polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) and glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs). This study also highlights the limitations of current models in describing F-EBPR processes and emphasises the need for improved models that account for higher order VFA metabolism and microbial community dynamics."

      "abstract": "Riparian areas play an important role in maintaining water quality in agricultural watersheds by buffering sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants. Recent studies have shown that in some cases riparian areas are a net source of phosphorus (P) in cold climates. This study assessed the impact of cattle grazing or harvesting of riparian areas on the spatial and vertical distribution of water-extractable phosphorus (WEP). This study measured the WEP in four distinctive sources: biomass, litter, organic layer, and Ah horizon in three riparian locations extending from the edge of the waterbody to the field edge. In addition to a control, three treatments were examined: (1) grazing; (2) high-density grazing; and (3) mowing. Prior to implementing the treatments, the Ah (0-10 cm) soil was the largest pool of WEP (42.5 mg m-2, ∼44%); however, the biomass (i.e., standing vegetation) was a considerable proportion of the total (26.3 mg m-2, ∼25%) WEP pool. The litter and organic layer had median WEP areal densities of 11.1 and 17.7 mg m-2, respectively. Findings revealed significant reductions in biomass WEP with median reductions of 10.4 and 18.7 mg m-2 for high-density grazing and mowing treatments, respectively. This reduction was more pronounced in the lower riparian locations where there was more biomass available to be grazed or mowed. There were no detectable changes in the other sources of WEP across all the treatments. Assessment of the control plots (pre- and post-treatment) clearly indicates that there is considerable small-scale spatial variability in P measurements in riparian areas. Overall, the results of this study suggest that management practices that target vegetation, including harvesting and short-term autumn grazing, may be mechanisms to reduce the potential P loss during the snowmelt period. To fully assess the risk of P loss, studies investigating other important riparian processes that also have a demonstrated impact on P mobility, including freeze-thaw cycles and flooding, are needed."

Herein, we report a novel synthesis of Cu3P particles loaded on yeast-derived biochar (Cu3P/BC) using Cu2+ as a precursor and mannan-phosphate from yeast cell walls as a sustainable phosphorus source. Cu3P/BC demonstrated a significantly superior catalytic performance in Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation, exhibiting a 25.2-fold increase in RhB removal efficiency and an approximately 4-fold increase in chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency compared to biochar alone. Furthermore, the catalytic Fenton-like performance remained robust, achieving degradation efficiencies between 70.7 % and 88.6 % across three different real water matrices, highlighting the catalyst's potential for practical applications. Stability tests revealed effective performance over four cycles, and post-regeneration, the removal rate increased to 96.4 %, with copper leaching ≤0.51 mg/L. Free radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed that reactive oxygen species, •OH, O2•-, and 1O2, played critical roles in the degradation of RhB. These reactive species were primarily generated through the redox cycling of Cu(II)/Cu(I), a process that facilitated H2O2 activation. Moreover, toxicity assessments indicated that while early intermediates show moderate toxicity, extended reaction times promote complete mineralization into non-toxic end products. This study offers a facile, eco-friendly method for fabricating TMP/carbon composites from yeast biomass, with significant potential for wastewater treatment."

Herein, a novel biodegradable ferrous sulfide nanosheet (FeS NS) is developed. Compared to the traditional photothermal material, black phosphorus nanosheet (BP NS), FeS demonstrates superior degradability and enhanced photothermal performance, and making it ideal for efficient photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, FeS degrades and releases H2S, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. This process leads to a reduction in heat shock protein expression, lowering the resistance of tumor cells to photothermal stimulation, and improving the efficacy of PTT. The released Fe2+ exhibits efficient peroxidase activity, triggering ferroptosis in tumor cells. Furthermore, due to its superparamagnetic nature, FeS NSs could accumulate at the tumor site and provide a strong magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal for imaging-guided tumor therapy. Overall, as a promising alternative to BP, the FeS NSs are a potentially innovative nanotheranostic agent of tumors, offering a synergistic approach to ferroptosis-PTT with MRI guidance."

Biochar, a sustainable and economical material, has demonstrated significant potential as an adsorbent for phosphorus, offering a viable solution for its recovery from wastewater. Various techniques have been explored to improve the ability of biochar to adsorb inorganic phosphate. While numerous studies have reviewed methods of biochar modification, the underlying adsorption mechanisms, and the thermodynamics and kinetics involved, a thorough examination that addresses the practical challenges of real-world wastewater treatment is currently lacking. This review aims to fill this gap by quantitatively analyzing the impact of coexisting species in wastewater on the adsorption of phosphate and by exploring the potential for simultaneous removal of other contaminants, such as nutrients, heavy metals, and dissolved organic matter. The review also discusses factors that affect the desorption of phosphate from biochar and presents practical applications for biochars post-adsorption. These applications include their use as slow-release phosphorus fertilizers, additives in concrete, and as novel adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals. This comprehensive analysis serves to synthesize current research on phosphate recovery by biochars and to propose practical uses for the adsorbed phosphorus, thereby guiding the development of biochar adsorption technology towards more effective and practical phosphorus management strategies.",

      "abstract": "The application of 2D nanomaterials for drug delivery via π-π interactions has been extensively investigated. However, these interactions often lack robustness in the presence of blood proteins due to the competitive binding of blood proteins, which results from strong π-π-stacking interactions with aromatic protein residues. This can lead to premature drug release and diminished therapeutic efficacy. To address this challenge, we developed a robust 2D delivery/therapeutic biomimetic nanoplatform that enhances the adsorption affinity and targeted delivery efficiency of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) by utilizing Cu2+-modified black phosphorus nanosheets (BP@Cu2+) through metal ion-assisted π-π interactions. The synergistic interactions between the π-electrons of BP and DOX, mediated by Cu2+ coordination, form a stable sandwiched π-cation-π stacking complex (BP@Cu2+/DOX). This metal-ion-bridged architecture significantly enhances the DOX loading capacity and minimizes premature release in serum. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, this interaction is disrupted, enabling controlled release of both DOX and Cu2+ ions. Furthermore, the encapsulation of the complex within tumor cell membranes significantly enhances the efficiency of tumor targeting, resulting in a biomimetic nanoplatform (BP@Cu2+/DOX-CMs). Combined with near-infrared laser irradiation, this nanoplatform achieves synergistic multimodal therapy by integrating phototherapy, chemotherapy, chemodynamic therapy, and cuproptosis to enhance antitumor efficacy. The study highlights the potential of metal ion-assisted π-π stacking interactions in the development of advanced 2D nanoplatforms, thereby paving the way for innovative biomedical applications utilizing conventional 2D nanomaterials.",

However, achieving the simultaneous removal of P, Cr(VI), and Sb(V) remains challenging, and the interactions among these pollutants are not well understood. We investigated electrocoagulation as a method for the simultaneous removal of these pollutants, utilizing response surface methodology to optimize operating parameters. All pollutants were removed completely under optimal conditions: an initial pH of 3.0, current density of 32.43 A/m², NaCl concentration of 8.0 g/L, and reaction time of 20 minutes, with an energy consumption of 0.187 kWh/m³ -significantly lower than most reported values. The direct precipitation of FePO₄ and the adsorptive co-precipitation of Fe(OH)₃ synergistically contributed to P removal. The presence of Cr(VI) and Sb(V) accelerated Fe(OH)₃ floc agglomeration by oxidizing Fe2 + to Fe3+ and enhancing Fe utilization, respectively, thereby improving P removal efficiency. Internal adsorption co-precipitation by Fe(OH)₃ was the dominant mechanism for Cr(VI) and Sb(V) removal, accounting for 89.97 % and 66.90 %, respectively. However, the presence of P inhibited Cr(VI) and Sb(V) removal by reducing Fe(OH)₃ floc formation due to competition with Fe³ ⁺. These findings elucidate the simultaneous removal mechanisms and mutual interactions of P, Cr(VI), and Sb(V), offering valuable insights for the treatment of textile dye wastewater."

      "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is a critical and finite raw material fundamental to various biological roles and industrial applications. Its limited availability can be managed through recovery from wastewater. However, wastewater often contains hazardous contaminants, including antibiotic resistance and virulence genes associated with extracellular DNA (exDNA), which may compromise the safety of recovered P products. To address this issue, magnetically separated electric arc furnace dust (ms-EAFD), a by-product of the steelmaking process, was functionalized using dissolution recrystallization protocol utilizing NaOH and Ca(OH)2 and applied as an adsorbent for P recovery and exDNA removal from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent. Upon functionalization, ms-EAFD increases its specific surface area seven-fold and shifts zeta potential towards positive values. This causes an increase in phosphate removal efficiency from 7.1% to above 70% and adsorption capacity from 0.5 to above 4.5 mg/g (at 15 mg/L PO43-). Ca-enriched material induce microprecipitation of CaP in P-rich wastewater, improving phosphorus removal efficiency. exDNA removal efficiency depends on its concentration and the composition of the water matrix regardless of the applied adsorbent. All materials demonstrate exDNA removal efficiency ranging from 75 to 100% in wastewater containing 0.5 PO43- mg/L, which drops to approximately 20% when PO43- concentration reaches 5 mg/L. The adsorbent regeneration with 0.5M NaOH (pH > 13) led to efficient phosphate desorption and complete degradation of exDNA in the eluate. The proposed approach may facilitate industrial symbiosis and repurpose EAFD into a valuable material for improving wastewater treatment efficiency.",

However, the EBPR process can experience upsets due to a lack of influent carbon or inadequate anaerobic zones. By using a sidestream EBPR (S2EBPR) process, carbon can be generated internally through fermentation processes and a higher anaerobic mass fraction can be attained in smaller volumes. This study investigates nutrient removal and microbial community trends in a full-scale S2EBPR demonstration at the Calumet Water Reclamation Plant. The study aims to improve a process model of the system by better representing the activity of glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAO) and potential competitors of phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAO), which were found in high abundance in this study. Modifying anaerobic hydrolysis, GAO glycogen storage and ORP activity parameters resulted in model prediction improvements of approximately 5% for nitrate and nitrite and 10-60% for phosphorus. The study also uses shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile denitrification pathways of PAO and GAO. It shows that denitrifying GAO may contribute to nitric oxide reduction to a greater degree than denitrifying PAO. This study improves process modeling predictions for S2EBPR and highlights the potential role of denitrifying PAO and GAO in combined phosphorus and nitrogen removal in S2EBPR.",

      "abstract": "Sewage sludge (or biosolids) produced during wastewater treatment contain significant amounts of phosphorus. Pyrolysis treatment can produce a safe material while sequestering carbon; however, it underutilises the phosphorus in the resulting biochar, leaving it partially inaccessible to plants. Here the effect of doping calcium-rich sewage sludge (14 % calcium) with potassium acetate, combustion wood ash and its water-extract on phosphorus availability, and carbon and nitrogen release during pyrolysis are investigated at 500 and 700 °C. The aim was to produce an effective circular economy material with superior P release properties. Potassium acetate addition increased the amount of water-extractable phosphorus in sewage sludge biochar produced at 500 °C by three-fold (to 3.6 % of the total phosphorus content) but had no effect in biochar produced at 700 °C. As hypothesised, potassium doping was less effective in increasing phosphorus availability than reported previously due to the high calcium content in sewage sludge that locked up phosphorus. In a wheat pot trial, doped biochar (500 °C) still resulted in 28 % higher stem biomass and 29 % grain phosphorus uptake compared to biochar without potassium acetate and the water-extractable P content in thermally treated sewage sludge correlated with phosphorus uptake and plant biomass. Replacement of potassium acetate with combustion wood ash did not improve phosphorus availability in biochar. However, extracting wood ash with water first and using this extract for sewage sludge doping added 2.5 % potassium and doubled the water-extractable phosphorus content in the resulting 500°C-biochar. This proof-of-concept highlights suitability of waste-derived wood ash extract as dopant to boost the potassium content and phosphorus availability in sewage sludge biochar. This innovative circular economy process produces enhanced sewage sludge biochar fertilisers from two waste materials with significant economic and environmental benefits, including diversion of waste from landfill and emission reductions."

      "abstract": "Parallel hybrid ordinary differential equations (ODEs) include a novel technique for operational management support of wastewater treatment plants committed to carbon neutrality, human footprint reduction, and ecosystem service conservation in water environments. These equations seamlessly integrate mechanistic and data-driven components operating together. However, simultaneously improving their predictive performance and physical interpretability is a major challenge. In a previous work, this problem was resolved using a parallel hybrid ODE that integrates Activated Sludge Model No. 2d (ASM2d) as the mechanistic component with an artificial neural network (ANN) as the data-driven component. Supporting data are incorporated for modeling biological phosphorus removal. However, the supporting data-enhanced hybrid ODE (SH-ODE) does not involve mass conservation in the ANN component and automatic calibration in the ASM2d. This study modifies the previously developed SH-ODE to enhance its physical consistency. First, a stoichiometry defined in the ASM2d was embedded into the ANN component as hard physical constraints to preserve mass conservation. Operational data were acquired from three anaerobic/aerobic sequencing batch reactors, and phosphate release activity was evaluated from anaerobic batch experiments to serve as supporting data. The predictive performance for phosphate achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.90. Second, a serialized ANN was incorporated into the SH-ODE with mass conservation for the automatic calibration of five selected parameters. Owing to the pivotal contributions of the supporting data, the R2 value further improved to 0.93. Moreover, the supporting data contributed to phosphate estimation by the ASM2d through biomass compensation achieved by the parallelized ANN. A novel index was developed to quantify physical interpretability based on the contribution of the ASM2d for estimating phosphate dynamics. Results showed that the modified SH-ODE achieved a high predictive performance and physical interpretability.",

Treatment wetlands, called stormwater treatment areas (STAs), were constructed and subsequently expanded to remediate EAA-derived TP, ideally yielding long-term outflow concentrations to the Everglades Protection Area (EvPA) of 13 µg/L TP or less. To date, TP-remediation has been insufficient relative to TP loads discharged from some EAA basins. We assessed 20 years of EAA basin-level and farm-level TP concentration and outflow data with the goal of understanding trends over time and identifying TP hot spots. Using monitoring data from water year (WY) 2000 through WY 2019, TP discharged from EAA farms averaged 74.68 ± 38.87 µg/L and was as high as 269.38 µg/L. We identified spatial and temporal variations in TP concentration, farm outflow, TP load, and TP flow-weighted mean concentration from the EAA farms. EAA basins TP concentration showed the presence of a decreasing trend between WY 2000 and WY 2012 and increasing trends for the more recent period WY 2010 to WY 2019. Using a nine-parameter Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), we observed that 31% of EAA farms posed above-average pollution risk, including 22 farms in the S-5A and 17 farms in the S-6 basins. These hot spot farms are primary candidate sites for targeted interventions aimed at reducing TP runoff, alleviating the TP burden on downstream STAs, and offsetting the recent increasing trend.",

METHODS: Data from 7,539 asthma patients in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018 cohort were analyzed using weighted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a nomogram were used to assess survival probabilities and individualized risk, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis evaluated non-linear dose-response relationships. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: Higher dietary phosphorus intake was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22-0.85 for the highest vs. lowest quartile; p for trend = 0.018). Kaplan-Meier curves showed improved survival with increasing phosphorus intake, a result consistently supported by subgroup analyses. RCS analysis confirmed a non-linear dose-response relationship, identifying a threshold at 1,861.52 mg/day, below which higher phosphorus intake was significantly associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. However, above this threshold, the protective effect diminished. Sensitivity analyses further validated these results. CONCLUSION: Elevated dietary phosphorus intake is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in asthma patients, suggesting its potential as a dietary intervention."

      "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) recovery from wastewater using integrated techniques i.e., adsorption combined with advanced oxidation technologies is a novel approach for cleaning wastewater and preventing eutrophication. This approach, however, has not been extensively studied, particularly in the context of real wastewater applications. In this study, a green biomass-based sol-gel method was developed using potato starch (PS) and MgCl2·6H2O to synthesize MgO (PS-MgO). The unique synthesis method resulted in PS-MgO composed predominantly of spherical particles with an average size of about 103 nm and exhibited superior P adsorption performance compared to commercial MgO materials (GH-MgO and AD-MgO). The Langmuir maximum P adsorption capacity (mg/g) of the PS-MgO was 429.4, while that of the commercial GH-MgO and AD-MgO was 341.3 and 421.7, respectively, at the solution pH 7.0. The kinetic model fitting demonstrated that the adsorption rate of PS-MgO was faster than the two commercial MgOs. Importantly, PS-MgO can maintain a high P adsorption capacity across a wide pH range (425 mg/g at pH 5.0 and 369 mg/g at pH 11.0), whereas the P adsorption capacities of GH-MgO (153 at pH 5.0 and 297 at pH 11.0) and AD-MgO (422 at pH 5.0 and 200 at pH 11.0) were more pH-dependent. In addition, PS-MgO exhibits high selectivity for P capture in solutions containing coexisting ions, and the P-loaded PS-MgO can efficiently release P through acid or base treatment, highlighting its potential for reuse as a fertilizer. To enhance P recovery from real livestock wastewater, the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma technology was combined with MgO adsorption. The P recovery capacity of MgOs from livestock wastewater increased 1.4-1.7 times after DBD plasma treatment, attributed to the degradation of aromatic proteins and microbial metabolites. These findings provide new insights into the design of efficient and environmentally friendly materials for P recovery, while also demonstrating the potential of integrating advanced oxidation technologies with adsorption processes.",

The results indicate that the microwave treatment led to the formation of NaCaPO4 crystals, with a significant increase in P solubility post-treatment, which is crucial for plant uptake. Moreover, increasing the amorphous content of the ash led to a decrease in P solubility because sodium atoms tend to diffuse within the silica network.

In this study, integration of bio-electrochemical (BEC) treatment with AD of dairy manure was proposed to simultaneously improve biogas production, reduce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) release, and remediate nutrients in digestate. A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a BEC unit using stainless steel mesh electrodes at applied voltages of 0.5-0.8 V were integrated for continuous AD treatment of liquid dairy manure. At a relatively short hydraulic retention time of 20 d and a high voltage of 0.8 V, the biogas production of CSTR-BEC significantly outperformed that of the control operated in an open circuit mode. The methane (CH4) content in the biogas from CSTR-BEC at 0.8 V reached 71.1%, leading to a specific CH4 yield of CSTR-BEC (238.6 mL/gVS) higher by 42.5% than that of the control. The higher applied voltage of 0.8 V in CSTR-BEC also secured significant aqueous sulfide and gaseous H2S removals of 58.6% and 89%, respectively. Meanwhile, stronger electrochemical reactions in CSTR-BEC resulted in efficient removals of soluble and total phosphorus from dairy manure at a range of 49.5-63.7%. The compositional analysis of cathode precipitates implies that the release of iron ions from the sacrificial anode for further precipitation and adsorption might be the main route for sulfide and phosphorus removal. The average power consumption of the BEC unit (1.024 kWh/m3/d) at 0.8 V was 7.9-fold that at 0.5 V, whereas the net energy gain of CSTR-BEC (7.42 MJ/m3/d) was still comparable to that of the control because of the improved CH4 production. This bio-electrochemically assisted AD system offers a promising perspective in cleaner bioenergy production with concurrent considerable contaminants remediation from dairy manure.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates how exogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) influence the root responses of Cunninghamia lanceolata under nutrient limitations. Specifically, we assessed the differential effects of syringic acid and 1-butene on root morphology, phosphorus acquisition, and stress resilience. Clonal Chinese fir seedlings were utilized to test the effects of treatment with these two exogenous VOCs under both phosphorus supply (1.0 mM KH2PO4) and no phosphorus supply (0 mM KH2PO4) treatments in a controlled pot experiment. Compared to syringic acid, 1-butene significantly enhanced root morphological traits, including root length, specific surface area, and root volume. These morphological changes enhanced the root's ability to acquire phosphorus. Moreover, the addition of 1-butene increased the underground phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) by 25.6% compared to the addition of syringic acid. Furthermore, the addition of 1-butene stimulated higher activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD). Proteomic analysis revealed that 1-butene induced significant changes in root protein expression, particularly in proteins associated with stress responses, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and phosphate transport. Compared to syringic acid, 1-butene promoted the differential expression of phosphate transporter proteins, indicating its beneficial effects on the root systems of Chinese firs under low-phosphorus stress. These findings underscore the potential of 1-butene in promoting root efficiency and phosphorus acquisition in forest species, providing insights for enhancing plant adaptation to nutrient limitations.",

However, the capability of the denitrifying phosphorus removal process to treat PFOA-containing wastewater, as well as its response mechanisms, are unclear. This study used batch experiments to assess the short-term impact of PFOA on denitrifying phosphorus removal systems. During a single cycle, the addition of PFOA predominantly enhanced phosphate removal in the system mainly by the anaerobic phosphorus release pathway, but had no substantial effect on nitrogen removal. COD removal efficiency has a substantial positive correlation with C6-HSL and C8-HSL concentrations. As the PFOA concentration increased, the ROS concentration and enzyme activity also increased, while the PN/PS ratio decreased, causing the sludge to become looser. At the beginning of the second cycle, the impact of PFOA on phosphorus removal efficiency shifted from promotion to inhibition. These findings shed fresh light on the influence of PFOA on the denitrifying phosphorus removal mechanism, potentially furthering its use in the treatment of fluoride-containing wastewater.",

Optimizing the combination of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers can maximally significantly enhance farmers' economic returns while concurrently mitigate soil environmental pollution. For this purpose, a field experiment based on a randomized complete block design was conducted over two consecutive years (2019 and 2020) in Shihezi, Xinjiang province, China. The WL366HQ variety of alfalfa was evaluated with four levels each of urea and monoammonium phosphate. The effects of fertilizer treatments were assessed on alfalfa yield, growth traits, nutritional quality, fertilizer use efficiency, and economic benefit. Application of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and their interaction significantly (P< 0.05) affected cumulative alfalfa dry matter (DM) yield. In general, compared to no-fertilization treatment, the application of N and P fertilizers resulted in increased plant height, stem thickness, crude protein, and ether extract of alfalfa, while neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) exhibited a decreasing trend. Additionally, while N and P fertilizer application reduced corresponding fertilizer use efficiency, it increased non-corresponding fertilizer use efficiency. During the two-year experimental period, the treatment involving the application of urea at 286.3 kg·ha-1 combined with monoammonium phosphate at 192 kg·ha-1 achieved the highest evaluation scores for production performance, fertilizer use efficiency, and total net profit, resulting in a net profit increase of 44.18% compared to the no-fertilizer treatment. These findings lay the groundwork for nuanced fertilization strategies in future alfalfa cultivation."

In this study, we successfully prepared ordered needlelike structured Co-Fe hydroxide with F-ion immersion (Fe/Co(OH)F) on the surface of nickel foam and explored the synergistic strengthening effects of Mo cation doping and P anion doping. The ordered needlelike structure of Fe/Co(OH)F was destroyed during the phosphating calcination process, while Mo doping transformed it into a rough surface platelike structure. By combining Mo doping with phosphating treatment, the obtained Fe/F-MoCo-POx catalyst presented a crystalline-amorphous heterostructure and platelike morphology with enhanced OER performance. At a high current density of 200 mA cm-2, the Fe/F-MoCo-POx catalyst exhibited an overpotential of 300 mV without i-R compensation and maintained a potential decay rate of only 0.16 mV h-1 after a 560 h durability test. Electrochemical testing combined with phase structure and composition analysis revealed that P doping induced the formation of an amorphous surface layer of hypophosphite Fe(PO3)3, which was found to undergo anion exchange with *OH during electrochemical testing. This surface reconstruction thus formed a rich -OH catalytic layer on the surface of Fe/F-MoCo-POx, which then exhibited a remarkably lowered overpotential and boosted OER kinetics, surpassing most state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. This finding underscores the synergistic effect of Mo and P doping in forming a crystalline-amorphous heterostructure, which boosts alkaline OER performance, aiding in cost reduction and improvement of the hydrogen production efficiency through water electrolysis at high current densities."

Herein, we developed a multifunctional nanocarrier (NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD) for tumor-targeting chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer in a controlled manner. The nanocarrier was constructed by enveloping nano-sized black phosphorus (NBP) within a mesoporous silica shell (mSiO2) modified with the tumor-targeting peptide c(Arg-Gly-Asp-dPhe-Cys) (cRGD). Due to the existence of pore channels within mSiO2, NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD achieved high loading efficiency of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) molecules (NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD/I3C), an anti-tumor agent derived from food. Mediated by cRGD/integrin αvβ3 interaction, NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD/I3C reached breast tumors in a targeted manner. Once irradiated by the near-infrared laser, our nanocarrier exhibited superior photothermal conversion, which not only induced photothermal therapy but also facilitated the release of I3C from NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD/I3C within tumor cells to inhibit the activation of proto-oncogenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway and drive chemotherapy. All these attributes contributed to a satisfactory therapeutic effect toward breast tumors, manifesting in significant inhibition of cell proliferation, promotion of cell apoptosis, and reduction of tumor micro-vessel formation, which led to the efficient inhibition of tumor growth. Collectively, the nanocarrier developed here provided useful insights into the development of multifunctional platforms to effectively combat cancer."

      "abstract": "With global warming, the frequency and duration of drought is becoming longer and longer, which seriously affects the survival of trees. Light intensity control, such as shading, is an important measure in seedling nurseries. However, it is unclear whether early shading affects the drought tolerance of seedlings used in afforestation. We conducted a two-stage experiment on Pinus yunnanensis seedlings. First, three different shading treatments were set, namely HL (0% shading), ML (55% shading), and LL (80% shading). After 90 days of cultivation, the seedlings of each shading treatment were subjected to CK (water content of 90% ± 5%), LD (water content of 75% ± 5%), MD (water content of 60% ± 5%) and SD (water content of 45% ± 5%) continuous drought for 30 days. The contents of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and their ratios in the needles of P. yunnanensis seedlings were measured. Early shading affected the starch accumulation and the balance between C absorption and consumption in P. yunnanensis seedlings during drought. Early shading affected C consumption, P utilization efficiency, and N restriction under drought stress. The phenotypic plasticity index showed that the plasticity of P. yunnanensis seedlings under drought stress followed the order: LL > HL > ML. The results of principal component analysis showed that the performance under drought stress followed the order HL > LL > ML. These results indicated that early shading could affect the response of P. yunnanensis seedlings to drought. The P. yunnanensis seedlings grown under HL and LL were more resistant to drought stress than those grown under ML. It is suggested that 0% or 80% shading should be applied at seedling stage to improve the drought resistance of P. yunnanensis.",

The best adsorbent for capturing CO2 among the developed adsorbents was P‑carbon-2000mgS-H2O2, which had surface area of 652 m2/g, a total pore volume of 0.446 cm3/g, an average pore size of 2.74 nm, narrow micropore distribution, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)-based sulfur content of 5.7 at.% and phosphorus content of 3.7 at.%, Raman-based average PAHs size of 24.9 Å and a defect density of 4.47 × 1011 cm-2, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)-based nano-crystallite height of 11.15 Å and length of 23.35 Å. The CO2 adsorption capacity of P‑carbon-2000mgS-H2O2 was 1.95 mmol/g at 25 °C and 1 bar (3.02 mmol/g at 0 °C), and it also demonstrated an impressive CO2 selectivity over N2 at 25 °C, with 15.24 at 0.5 bar and 12.03 at 1 bar. In addition to cyclic performance, the isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, which was found to be between 22 and 23 kJ/mol, suggested that a physical mechanism predominated the CO2 interaction with active sites. These findings suggest that employing elemental sulfur to produce glycerol-derived porous carbon with sulfur-phosphorus co-doping and subsequent H2O2 treatment is an effective method to produce CO2 capture adsorbents, facilitating the usage of glycerol and elemental sulfur - based products for large-scale applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), a chronic and progressive disease, significantly impacts the patients' social, emotional, and mental well-being. Current treatment for AGA are mainly limited by drug side effects and the stratum corneum (SC) barrier of scalp. RESULTS: To address these issues, we developed a microneedle (MN) system loaded with black phosphorus nanosheets (BP) encapsulating baicalin (BA), a natural ingredient, for effective treatment of AGA. We first fabricated BP-BA based on the BP properties of high drug loading capacity and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. Upon 635 nm laser irradiation, BP-BA demonstrated efficient photothermal conversion to mild thermal of ~ 42 °C. This mild thermal effect controlled BA's stimuli-responsive release, enhanced cellular uptake, and effectively modulated gene expression in dihydrotestosterone-treated human dermal papilla cells, downregulating negative regulators such as SRD5A2, AR, DKK1, and TGFB1, while upregulating positive regulators like CTNNBIP1 and VEGFA. Furthermore, we encapsulated BP-BA to MN fabricating BP-BA@MNs to overcome the SC barrier. Compared with BP-BA@MNs without laser irradiation, BP-BA@MNs with laser irradiation significantly enhanced drug penetration into the subcutaneous area and accumulation at the follicular site. Importantly, BP-BA@MNs demonstrated synergistic efficacy against testosterone-induced AGA in vivo through combining BA chemotherapy, BP-mediated mild photothermal therapy, and MN delivery, as well as good biocompatibility and biosafety, and the underlying synergistic mechanism was elucidated in terms of follicular microenvironment reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: This combining BP mild photothermal and MN system is a promising approach for follicular targeted drug delivery, providing a multifunctional strategy for addressing the clinical needs of anti-AGA.",

      "abstract": "Phosphorus is essential for all living organisms and limits aquatic plant growth. Pulp mill effluents, particularly from Eucalyptus bleached kraft pulp mills, contain phosphorus concentrations that vary with operational conditions. This variability poses challenges for effective treatment and phosphorus removal. However, uncontrolled release of phosphorus-rich wastewaters causes eutrophication. This study focuses on optimizing phosphorus removal from such effluents using cobalt ferrite nanoparticles, with an emphasis on process optimization to address this variability. Minimizing phosphorus concentrations is crucial in wastewater engineering and surface water management. By employing design of experiments and response surface methodology, we aim to fine-tune the phosphorous removal process and pinpoint the key factors with the most significant impact. Optimal conditions for achieving over 90% removal from an effluent with 5 mg P/L were identified as a sorbent dose greater than 1.3 g/L and a pH range between 5 and 7, all within a contact time of only 15 min. For a contact time of 1 and 24 h, the conditions adjust to a sorbent dose greater than 0.97 and 0.83 g/L, respectively, with the pH range remaining the same. Our results highlight the effectiveness of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles as sorbents in the removal of phosphorus for water treatment purposes. This approach presents a sustainable and proficient strategy for phosphorus recovery from pulp mill effluents, thereby lessening environmental repercussions and offering a valuable resource for future use. This contributes to the maintenance of water quality and ecosystem preservation.",

      "abstract": "Rapid proliferation underlies the abnormal expansion of activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) and thereby contributes to the development and progression of liver fibrosis, so inhibition of HSC proliferation serves as a good antifibrotic strategy. As a potent topoisomerase II inhibitor, doxorubicin (DOX), an antineoplastic drug, exhibits a significant antifibrotic activity in vitro via retarding the growth of aHSCs and reversing their myofibroblastic phenotype, but its severe hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and renal toxicity limit its wide clinical application. Therefore, enhancing the specificity and efficacy of DOX in targeting aHSCs to improve its therapeutic index and minimize its adverse effects has become a key point for the success of DOX in antifibrotic treatment. In this study aimed at liver fibrosis treatment, we combined the excellent drug-loading capability and good biocompatibility of black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs), the protective and camouflaging properties of red blood cell membrane encapsulation, and the HSCs-targetability provided by the surface modification with vitamin A derivatives, into the construction of HSCs-targeted BP/DOX nanovesicles (BP/DOX@RMV-VA). The obtained DOX nanovesicles exhibited a uniform particle size and spheroid morphology, excellent diffusion property and stability, and high DOX loading. Specifically, they demonstrated outstanding biosafety, effective HSCs-targetability both in vivo and in vitro, and markedly improved pharmacokinetic profile of DOX. BP/DOX@RMV-VA produced strong antiproliferative and MF-phenotype reverting activity both in cultured aHSCs and in mice chronically injured by CCl4. And accordingly, the administration of BP/DOX@RMV-VA to CCl4-injured mice effectively suppressed the expansion of aHSCs and fibrogenesis, and significantly improved liver structure and function without causing detectable cardiotoxicity. These results highly suggest the therapeutic potential of BP/DOX@RMV-VA in treating liver fibrosis and other fibrosis-associated liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "It is essential to design multifunctional biomaterials for pro-osteogenesis, rooting out residual tumor cells and resisting infection after surgical resection of bone tumors. Herein, niobium oxide with oxygen vacancy (NbOv) was synthesized through a deoxidation reaction, which exhibited photothermal property because of strong light absorption in near-infrared (NIR) region. Subsequently, magnesium‑phosphorus gel composite (MP) containing NbOv (MPNOv) was fabricated, which also possessed photothermal property that effectively ablated tumor cells and eradicated bacteria under NIR irradiation in vitro. The in vitro experiments confirmed that compared with MP, MPNOv significantly boosted bone mesenchymal stem cells responses (e.g., propagation and osteoblastic differentiation) due to the presence of NbOv with bioactivity. The in vivo experiments demonstrate that MPNOv fostered bone generation and prevented tumor recurrence as well as infection. In short, MPNOv with good biocompatibility and photothermal property as well as pro-osteogenesis served as a multiple functional biomaterial conquered the tri-challenges: bone defect, tumor recurrence, and bacterial infection in bone tumor therapy. Accordingly, as a novel photothermal therapeutic platform, MPNOv with tumor cells/bacteria-eradicating and pro-osteogenesis ability would be applicable for treatment of bone tumors.",

      "abstract": "Realizing the enrichment of functional bacteria in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for wastewater treatment holds substantial research significance. This study explored a novel method of repeatedly oxygen-rich anode environment to enrich electrotrophic/heterotrophic bacteria (EHB) and denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (DPAOs) in membrane-less single-chamber air-cathode (AC) MFCs to treat household wastewater. Repeated accumulation of higher dissolved oxygen (DO) was conducive to enhancing the growth of EHB and DPAOs. The systems achieved the maximum removal of 99% of ammonium, 78% of total inorganic nitrogen and 55% of total phosphorus. Repeated oxygen-rich conditions favored the selection of nitrogen-oxidizing bacteria on both electrodes, such as unclassified_f_Xanthomonadaceae, unclassified_p_Bacteroidota, Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira, thereby increasing nitrate availability for DPAOs like Candidatus Contendobacter, unclassified_c_Actinomycetia as well as other denitrifiers such as Anaerolineales, unclassified_p_Chloroflexi, unclassified_o_Rhodospirillales. The genes nxrAB, narGH and nasC, associated with nitrification and denitrification, and the genes gcd, phoD, ugpQ, glpQ, involved in phosphate metabolism, were up-regulated in presence of repeated DO accumulation, thereby enhancing pollutants removal. This study presents a novel approach for the synchronous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from domestic wastewater through the enrichment of functional bacteria in the repeatedly oxygen-rich ACMFCs.",

      "abstract": "Micro-/nanobubble oxygenation irrigation, as a novel irrigation technique, has been widely utilized to enhance soil phosphorus availability and maize yield. Nevertheless, currently, most of the studies remain unclear about the precise mechanism through which micro-/nanobubble oxygenation improves soil phosphorus availability and maize yield. Therefore, we established two irrigation methods, conventional irrigation (CF) and micro-/nanobubble oxygenation irrigation (MB), to investigate the combined effects on enzyme activity, microbial communities, and soil phosphorus availability in the rhizosphere soil of maize.The results showed that compared to the CF treatment, the MB treatment significantly increased available phosphorus content and alkaline phosphatase activity in maize rhizosphere soil by 21.3% and 15.4%, respectively. Furthermore, MB significantly influenced bacterial diversity in the maize rhizosphere soil but did not considerably affect fungal diversity. Specifically, MB regulated the microbial community structure in the maize rhizosphere by altering the relative abundances of the bacterial phylum Firmicutes and the fungal phyla Mucoromycota, Chytridiomycota, and Basidiomycota. In addition, MB reduced the complexity of the bacterial network while increasing the interaction density among bacterial species. Meanwhile, MB enhanced the complexity of the fungal network. Structural equation modeling indicated that MB primarily promoted soil alkaline phosphatase activity by regulating bacterial community diversity, thereby enhancing soil phosphorus availability. In conclusion, the application of micro-/nanobubble oxygenation irrigation enhances the activity of alkaline phosphatasein the soil by modulating the microbial community within the rhizosphere, thereby facilitating increased phosphorus availability in the rhizosphere of maize."

      "abstract": "In modern agriculture, fertilizers are commonly used to increase crop yields; however, their negligent use can lead to environmental pollution and the waste of essential nutrients such as inorganic phosphate (Pi). Encapsulated fertilizers are a feasible alternative that could prevent these issues, as they can protect Pi from leaching and extend the interval between applications. In this study, we developed and tested innovative fertilizers (IFs) manufactured with KH2PO4, encapsulated with chitosan modified via high-frequency ultrasound treatment. The characterization of these fertilizers consisted of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy to determine their sizes and forms. In addition, we evaluated the phosphate release profile using electrical conductivity. The IFs were spheroidal microcapsules with an average diameter of 0.5-2 μM and showed slow-release behavior. Their efficacy was assessed via in vivo and in vitro assays, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a study model. As expected, the IFs promoted the growth of seedlings. One of the IFs showed enhanced growth promotion, contrasting with the control. This phenotype was likely promoted by this fertilizer due to the synergistic effect of Pi and the modified chitosan used as an encapsulant matrix. Our results highlight the potential of these formulations, which have unique properties and could be used on a large scale."

The size impacts of BPs on the antibacterial ability and biocompatibility of BPs/Mel nanocomposites were studied systematically. Results showed that the nanocomposites made from middle-sized BPs (BPs/Mel-7) have strong antibacterial ability as well as good biocompatibility.

      "abstract": "Background: Our previous research in an experimental model of current environmental human exposure to cadmium (Cd) (female rats fed a diet containing Cd at 1 and 5 mg/kg for up to 2 years) revealed that chronic treatment with this toxic element destroyed the metabolism of the bone tissue, decreased mineralisation, and weakened bone biomechanical properties, whereas the co-administration of a 0.1% chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa L. (Michx.) Elliott berry) extract (AME) ameliorated the osteotoxic action of Cd. Methods: In this study, it was explored whether the unfavourable effect of Cd and the protective action of AME might be mediated by the impact on the metabolism of bone essential elements such as calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphorus (Pi), including the pathways of its regulation by calciotropic hormones (parathormone-PTH, calcitonin-CT, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-1,25(OH)2D3) and Klotho. Results: Low-level Cd treatment (1 mg/kg) caused only a temporary elevation in the serum PTH concentration and a decline in the concentration of CT. Moderate treatment with Cd (5 mg/kg) destroyed the body homeostasis of both mineral elements (lowered their concentrations in the serum and enhanced urinary loss), influenced the serum concentrations of Klotho and calciotropic hormones, as well as reduced the concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1alpha-hydroxylase (1alpha-OHase) and 1,25(OH)2D3 in the kidney. The application of AME during Cd intoxication improved the pathways involved in maintaining Ca and Pi homeostasis and allowed subjects to maintain the proper levels of these elements in the serum and urine. Conclusions: In conclusion, Cd at low-to-moderate exposure may exert an unfavourable impact on bone by influencing the pathways involved in regulating Ca and Pi metabolism and destroying the body status of these minerals. It seems that the possible mechanism of the osteoprotective effect of AME during chronic intoxication with this toxic element involves normalization of the concentrations of calciotropic hormones and Klotho in the serum and improvement of the homeostasis of Ca and Pi. This study provided further evidence that chokeberry products may be an effective strategy in counteracting the unfavourable effects of chronic low-to-moderate exposure to Cd.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate that tenapanor, an inhibitor of sodium/proton exchanger-3 (NHE3), diminishes intestinal phosphorus (Pi) absorption. Given NHE3's pivotal role in sodium (Na+) metabolism, there is a suspected functional link between Na+ and Pi metabolism. High-salt diets (HSD) have been demonstrated to disrupt calcium (Ca2+) metabolism. Since Ca2+ and Pi share analogous metabolic pathways, it is yet to be determined whether HSD also impacts Pi metabolism. METHODS: Male C57 mice were randomly assigned to three groups: a standard diet group, HSD groups for 1 week (HSD-1w) and 4 weeks (HSD-4w). Throughout the study, dietary intake and water consumption were monitored using metabolic cages, and urine and feces were collected. Blood pressure was measured using a noninvasive tail vein sphygmomanometer. Upon completion of the intervention, mice were euthanized under anesthesia for blood collection, and intestinal and renal tissues were harvested for molecular analysis. RESULTS: Although plasma Pi levels were comparable between HSD groups and the control group, HSD groups exhibited increased urinary Pi excretion and decreased fecal Pi excretion. The HSD-4w group displayed elevated parathyroid hormone levels, reduced fibroblast growth factor 23 levels, and higher renal Cyp27b1 mRNA expression. The expression of sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2b (Npt2b) and NHE3 was elevated in the intestine of HSD mice. CONCLUSION: HSD disrupts Pi metabolism by enhancing urinary Pi excretion and altering hormonal levels. The decrease in fecal Pi excretion, coupled with the upregulation of intestinal Pi transporter expression, suggests that HSD promotes intestinal Pi absorption in mice.",

To advance in the field of cancer therapeutics, the research trend has gradually shifted to the development of biocompatible, controlled, and stable carrier systems. To address such issues, herein, we report NIR-responsive black phosphorus (BP) nanosheet-integrated niosomes to mediate chemo-phototherapy of cancers. Niosome-coated black phosphorus nanosheets loaded with indocyanine green (ICG) and doxorubicin (DOX) (NBID) exhibit very high drug loading efficiency (>90%). Upon 808 nm NIR light irradiation, the NBID system initiates combinatorial effects where heat generation induced from BP nanosheets and ICG disrupts the niosomal coating, facilitating the controlled release of ICG and DOX in a pH- and light dual-responsive manner. This combinatorial approach induces DNA damage in cancer cells via DOX and also triggers photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic (PDT) effects, significantly enhancing tumor eradication. In a 2D cell culture model, the NBID formulation demonstrates excellent cytocompatibility in the dark, effective tumor cell uptake, and tumor cell death, showing potential for further application. To mimic the cancer microenvironment even more closely, the NBID nanoformulation has been tested against the 3D tumor spheroids, where NBID formulation shows tumor uptake and causes cancer cell death. The therapeutic efficacy of the NBID system can be controlled by laser, proving its light-responsive behavior to kill cancer cells in vitro. This integrated approach using NBID as a potent platform for combinatorial cancer therapy offers a promising advancement in achieving a safer, controlled, and stable drug delivery system."

With the rapid growth of the aquaculture industry, aquaculture effluent has gradually become a significant source of phosphorus pollution. However, this important phosphorous source has often been overlooked in previous studies. In this study, we utilized phosphate oxygen isotope (δ18OP) combined with the Bayesian isotope mixing model in R (MixSIAR) to identify and quantify the major phosphorus sources in Xijiang Estuary, China. The results show that the average concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in the receiving waters ranged from 0.03 to 0.34 mg/L, with aquaculture effluent indeed contributing the most to phosphorous loading (30.5 %), generally higher than other phosphorus sources such as livestock feces (29.6 %), Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) effluent (24.0 %) and agricultural soil (15.8 %). Additionally, significant spatial differences were observed in the contribution of different phosphorous sources. This study highlights the previously underestimated role of aquaculture in phosphorus loading in estuarine regions and provides valuable insights for water quality management strategies."

This study assesses how these coagulants impact nutrient recovery and separated fraction's characteristics, aiming to improve the solid-liquid separation process using biochar and zeolite. The FeCl3 treatment, biochar, and zeolite showed optimum nutrient recovery among the tested coagulants for solid (93% of total P) and liquid (90% and 50% of total NH4+ and K, respectively) phase separation of swine manure. Most macronutrients present in swine manure Ca (99%), Mg (76%), and P (71%) exist in the solid fraction, while NH4+ (100%) and K (72%) are predominantly present in the liquid fraction and their distribution changed under the influence of coagulating agents. Gibb's free energy (ΔG0) values of P (-19.7 kJ mol-1) and K (-5.31 kJ mol-1) were used to assess the applicability of flocculation followed by sedimentation process as opposed to the reverse one. Characterization of manure solids using E4/E6 ratio, FTIR, pH metric curve, and desorption with Mehlich-III solution (∼12% recycled of 93% separated P) suggest that P strongly complexed in the separated solid fraction, possibly through cation bridging and ligand-exchange reactions. Adsorption-desorption results indicate that the cation exchange was responsible for NH4+ (99%) and K (73%) recycling using zeolite. Inclusively, the study presents a proper combination of coagulant and physical processes to recover and recycle nutrients from swine manure effectively.",

      "abstract": "Shortage of phosphorus resource has become a global concern. Due to the high phosphorus content in sewage sludge, phosphorus recovery can be realized from thermal products of sewage sludge. Phosphorus recovery performance of smoldering ash (SA), incineration ash (IA) and pyrolysis char (PC) was investigated. The precipitate rate of phosphorus in acid and alkali leaching solutions is over 94 % by magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) methods. For MAP method, the recovered P contents in the precipitations of SA, IA and PC are 23.25 ± 0.35, 31.71 ± 0.79 and 23.76 ± 0.24 mg/g, respectively. For HAP recovery, the phosphorus contents per unit mass of precipitated products are lower than that by MAP, ranging from 13.67 ± 0.10 to 22.89 ± 0.34 mg/g. The purity of the recovered products was evaluated based on the contents of major elements and heavy metals in recovered products. Most of major elements and heavy metals can coprecipitate with phosphorus in the recovery products by acid leaching-MAP method. Due to the low impurity content in the alkali leaching solution and insolubility of most heavy metals in it, the products recovered by alkali leaching-HAP shows higher purity than that by acid leaching-MAP method. The phosphorus recovery performance, reagent consumption and purity of recovered products of the two methods were compared. Acid leaching-MAP recovery is optimal for IA due to its highest P recovery and purity, with lower reagent consumption compared to alkali leaching-HAP. For SA and PC, alkali leaching-HAP recovery is preferable due to its higher P recovery purity and market price of hydroxyapatite products.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Phosphorus (P) is a crucial growth-limiting nutrient in soil, much of which remains challenging for plants to absorb and use. Unlike chemical phosphate fertilizers, phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs) offer a means to address available phosphorus deficiency without causing environmental harm. PSMs possess multiple mechanisms for phosphorus solubilization. Although the phosphorus-solubilizing mechanisms of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) have been well characterized, the mechanisms utilized by phosphate-solubilizing fungi (PSF) remain largely unexplored. METHODS: This study isolated a PSF strain, Trametes gibbosa T-41, from soil and evaluated its phosphorus solubilizing capacity with organic (calcium phytin; Phytin-P) and inorganic (tricalcium phosphate; Ca-P) phosphorus sources. The phosphorus solubilization, enzyme activity, and organic acid production of T-41 were measured. And the P-solubilizing mechanism conducted by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: T-41 exhibited varying phosphorus solubilizing capacity when grown with organic (calcium phytin; Phytin-P) and inorganic (tricalcium phosphate; Ca-P) phosphorus sources (109.80 ± 8.9 mg/L vs. 57.5 ± 7.9 mg/L, p < 0.05). Compared with the Ca-P treatment, T-41 demonstrated a stronger alkaline phosphatase (ALP) production capacity under Phytin-P treatment (34.5 ± 1.2 μmol/L/h vs. 19.8 ± 0.8 μmol/L/h, p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the production of oxalic acid, maleic acid, and succinic acid was higher under Phytin-P treatment (p < 0.05). Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis revealed that different phosphorus sources altered metabolic pathways such as galactose metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, and ascorbate and aldolate metabolism. Key metabolites like myo-inositol, 2-oxoglutarate, and pyruvate were found to impact the performance of T. gibbosa T-41 differently under the two P sources. Notably, synthesis in Ca-P vs. Pytin-P, T-41 upregulated genes involved in myo-inositol synthesis, potentially enhancing its P-solubilizing ability. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PSF at the transcriptomic and metabolomic levels, laying a theoretical foundation for the broader application of PSF as bio-phosphorus fertilizers in the future."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In China, the traditional method for analyzing soil available phosphorus is inadequate for large-scale soil assessment and nationwide soil formulation demands. To address this, we propose a rapid and reliable method for soil-available phosphorus detection. The setup includes an on-site rapid pre-treatment device, a non-contact conductivity detection device, and a capillary electrophoresis buffer solution system composed of glacial acetic acid and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. METHODS: The on-site rapid pre-treatment process includes fresh soil moisture content detection (moisture rapid detector), weighing (handheld weighing meter), stirring (handheld rapid stirrer), and filtration (soil rapid filter) to obtain the liquid sample, and direct injection (capillary electrophoresis detector). The phosphate ion detection parameters include capillary size, separation voltage, injection parameters, and electric injection. We used Liaoning brown soil, Henan yellow tidal soil, Heilongjiang black soil, and Anhui tidal soil as standard samples. Additionally, we used mathematical modeling methods and machine learning algorithms to analyze and process research data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Following calibration with standard samples, the experimental blind test samples demonstrated conformity with the national standard method, exhibiting a relative standard deviation of less than 3%. The proposed pre-treatment device and non-contact conductivity detector are powered by lithium-ion batteries, rendering them ideal for extended field operations. The non-contact conductivity detector obviates the need for direct contact with test samples, mitigating environmental pollution. Furthermore, the neural network model exhibited the highest level of goodness of fit in chemical data analysis."

      "abstract": "Freshwater resources are scarce in arid regions, and the rational use of brackish water resources can alleviate local freshwater shortages, but long-term brackish drip irrigation increases the risk of soil salinization, which in turn affects soil nutrient transformation and microbial diversity. Soil phosphorus availability is critical for crop growth, yet it is unclear how long-term brackish drip irrigation will affect soil phosphorus transformation. Therefore, to investigate the effects of long-term brackish drip irrigation on soil phosphorus-transforming microorganisms and their functional genes in cotton fields, the experiment was set up with two irrigation water salinities, freshwater （0.35 dS·m-1, FW） and brackish water （8.04 dS·m-1, SW）. The results showed that long-term brackish drip irrigation significantly decreased cotton dry matter weight, phosphorus uptake, yield, soil pH, and Ca2-P and Ca10-P contents but significantly increased cotton phosphorus content and soil water content； electrical conductivity； quick phosphorus； and Ca8-P, Al-P, Fe-P, and O-P contents. The dominant species in each treatment at the phylum level were Ascomycetes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacillus, and Greenscapes； and at the phylum level, the dominant species were α-Ascomycetes, Actinobacteria, β-Ascomycetes, Oleococcus thermophilus, and γ-Ascomycetes. including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi. Select dominant species at the class level included Alphaproteobacteria, Actinomycetia, Betaproteobacteria, Thermoleophilia, and Gammaproteobacteria. Long-term saline drip irrigation significantly reduced the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Nitrospirae but significantly increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Bacteroidetes and significantly reduced the expression levels of the organic phosphorus mineralization gene phnA, transport gene pit, and polyphosphate synthesis gene ppaC. Moreover, it significantly increased the expression levels of the polyphosphate degradation gene HDDC3； organic phosphorus mineralization genes phnG, phoA, phnH, phnL, phnM, phnN, phnP, and phnW； transport genes phnK, phnE, phnC, and phnD； and the regulatory gene phoB. Correlation analysis showed that soil phosphorus-cycling microorganisms and functional genes were closely related to soil physicochemical properties and soil inorganic phosphorus content. Therefore, long-term saline drip irrigation changes the composition of soil phosphorus-cycling microorganisms by affecting soil physical and chemical properties and inorganic phosphorus content, which in turn drives the expression of phosphorus-cycling-related functional genes to regulate and adapt to salt stress.",

      "abstract": "The removal of phosphorus from wastewater has consistently posed a major focus in the field of wastewater treatment. Microalgae-based phosphorus removal is widely acknowledged as an effective biological approach. However, ensuring the microalgae-mediated high phosphorus concentration removal remains a persistent challenge. In this study, a kind of multicellular microalgae, Klebsormidium sp., was used to explore its ability to remove phosphorus in high-phosphorus wastewater. The phosphorus removal rate by Klebsormidium sp. in highly concentrated (>20 mgP/L) wastewater can exceed 90%. To investigate the phosphorus absorption process, various nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations along with light conditions were employed. The results showed that 50% to 80% of the total phosphorus absorbed by microalgae entered the intracellular polymer. The phosphorus concentration and light intensity did not exert any significant effects on the absorption of phosphorus by microalgae. However, the nitrogen concentration and the light-to-dark ratio significantly influenced the storage of phosphorus by microalgae. At a nitrogen concentration over 300 mgN/L, phosphorus absorption by microalgae was inhibited. A higher light-to-dark ratio increased phosphorus transfer by microalgae, while the light duration exceeds 16 h inhibited it. Microalgae have emerged as promising materials for phosphorus removal in high-phosphorus sewage, the study offering potential solutions for a cleaner and more sustainable future."

      "abstract": "The effects of nutritional additions on the non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) of Pinus yunnanensis Franch. following coppicing were examined in this work. Three levels of phosphorous (P) addition, namely P0 (0 g/plant), P (2 g/plant), and P+ (4 g/plant), and two levels of nitrogen (N) additions, namely N0 (0 g/plant) and N+ (0.6 g/plant) The treatments consisted of D1 (N0P), D2 (N+P0), D3 (N0P), D4 (N+P), D5 (N0P), and D6 (N+P+), utilizing an orthogonal design to assess how these nutrients influence NSC levels and their components throughout many plant organs in P. yunnanensis. The findings showed that fertilization enhanced NSCs and their components' contents in P. yunnanensis. P treatment greatly raised NSC levels in sprouts as well as starch (ST) content in stems and sprouts. N treatment greatly raised soluble sugar (SS) and NSC content in stems and greatly accelerated the contents of NSCs and their components in sprouts. The combined application of N and P further improved SS content in stems. Fertilization effects varied over time, with significant increases in NSC content observed at different stages: at 0 d, fertilization significantly raised NSCs and their components in needles; at 90 d, roots and stems showed increases in both NSCs and their components' contents; at 180 d, stem ST content significantly increased; and at 270 d, NSCs and their components' contents across all organs were significantly increased. Especially in roots, stems, and sprouts, the combined N (0.6 g/plant) and P (2.0 g/plant) treatment (D4) produced the highest NSC concentration among the treatments. This suggested that NSC formation in plants might be greatly promoted by a balanced N and P fertilization ratio acting in concert. Moreover, fertilizer, as part of a general management plan, has long-term and significant benefits on plant development, especially after coppicing, accelerating recovery, expanding growth potential, and thereby strengthening the plant's capacity to adapt to environmental changes."

These benefits include reduced chemical use, lower sludge volumes, decreased reliance on costly chemical precipitants, and improved phosphorus recovery quality. Recent advancements in recovery technologies now enable efficient phosphorus extraction from digester supernatant, dewatered digested sewage sludge, and sewage sludge ash, each yielding different recovery efficiencies. Despite these advances, a comprehensive assessment of the phosphorus recovery potential from these target streams in conjunction with EBPR remains crucial and has yet to be fully explored.",

      "abstract": "Appropriate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization is critical for plant growth and production. Pinus yunnanensis, a silvicultural tree in southwestern China, faces economic and ecological limitations due to nutrient deficiency in the soils in its distribution areas. The slow growth of this species during the seedling stage exacerbates these problems. Therefore, it is important to realize the regulating effects of N and P proportioning fertilization on seedling growth to enhance nutrient-use efficiency. In this study, variations in morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of seedlings were analyzed under nine treatments of NP proportioning in an open nursery using a regression design. Growth in height and basal diameter increased and showed an approximate tendency in all treatments. The maximum biomass accumulation was observed at 480 d after treatment in roots of T5 (14.714 g) (application N 0.4 g·per-1 and P 3 g·per-1), stems of T5 (12.654 g), leaves of T9 (24.261 g) (application N 0.8 g·per-1 and P 6 g·per-1), aboveground parts of T9 (35.402 g) and individuals of T5 (49 g). The total chlorophyll content peaked in the leaves at 120 d and was correlated with the peak levels of N, P, and K in leaves. The content and reserves of nutrient elements in the organs of seedlings subjected to NP proportioning were significantly higher than those in unfertilized seedlings. Analysis of nutrient utilization efficiency revealed that T5 demonstrated superior seedling growth performance. Appropriate fertilization dosage of N and P for P. yunnanensis seedlings in this study was 0.32 g·per-1-0.58 g·per-1 and 3.02 g·per-1-4.95 g·per-1 respectively, using path analysis and regression equation. Transcriptomic sequencing revealed that there were 2,301 DEGs between T5 and T1 (control), which were involved in the uptake and assimilation of nutrients, biosynthesis of phytohormones and secondary metabolites, and photosynthesis. Additionally, the abundance of genes involved in cell division and proliferation, cellulose biosynthesis, and cell wall extension were dramatically upregulated, which potentially correlated with enhanced seedling growth. In conclusion, this study provides comprehensive information on the response of seedlings to varying proportions of N and P and may promote the growth of P. yunnanensis seedlings by optimizing the proportion of N and P in fertilizers."

      "abstract": "Among the various sewage sludge disposal technologies, thermal treatment has emerged as a promising method for the effective recovery of energy and nutrients. It is well established that sewage sludge contains a large amount of phosphorus (P), which can be further concentrated in the solid products upon thermal conversion, highlighting its potential for P recovery. This study investigated the migration of P during the thermal conversion of sewage sludge across a wide temperature range (500-900 °C) and under various atmospheric conditions (nitrogen, oxygen, and steam). Below 700 °C, the majority of P was retained in the sewage sludge char or ash (SSC/A), with the atmosphere exerting minimal influence on P behavior. However, at elevated temperatures (700-900 °C), the P retention rate in nitrogen atmosphere significantly decreased from 86.1% to 60.2%. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen and steam had a pronounced effect on P retention. At 900 °C, the P retention rates in oxygen and steam atmospheres were 70.5% and 76.2%, respectively, both of which were significantly higher than that in nitrogen atmosphere (60.2%). Notably, among the three atmospheric conditions examined, the steam atmosphere demonstrated the most substantial enhancement in the conversion of non-apatite phosphorus to apatite phosphorus, emphasizing its potential to improve the phosphorus bioavailability in SSC/A. The results obtained in the present study could provide theoretical support for the directional regulation of phosphorus during sewage sludge thermal conversion, aiming to achieve efficient phosphorus recovery.",

Existing treatment methods are often inefficient for single pollutants and new, environmentally friendly, and integrated treatment methods are needed. This study aimed to construct a novel polyethylene glycol (PEG)-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/sodium alginate (SA)/nano-TiO2 hydrogel microsphere-immobilized Bacillus velezensis system for the integrated degradation of complex pollutant components in food wastewater. SEM, FT-IR, XRD, mechanical, rheological, and swelling properties of the microspheres were tested, which confirmed the presence of nano-TiO2 in the microspheres and effectively improved the physical properties of the microspheres. The results showed that the microspheres containing 0.5 g/L nano-TiO2 in the preformed gel solution 1 had the best morphology, mechanical strength, physical stability, and 57.5 % bacterial carrying capacity. The microspheres inhibited Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and did not affect the growth and reproduction of Bacillus velezensis. The system achieved integrated degradation of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and antibiotics in food wastewater with degradation rates of 71.85 %, 36.84 %, and 40.52 %, respectively, and remained highly efficient after five times reuse. This method is environmentally friendly, efficient, and economical, which provides a new idea for wastewater treatment by immobilized microbial technology.",

This study explores the potential of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nHAPs) synthesized from poultry bones as P fertilizers. nHAPs were produced at 300 °C (nHAP300) and 700 °C (nHAP700), and their effectiveness was evaluated. An in vitro solubilization test with Pseudomonas alloputida evaluated the bacterium's ability to solubilize the nanoparticles, assessing dissolved P and organic acids produced. Additionally, a soil leaching test measured P losses and bioavailable P in soil compared to a conventional fertilizer, the triple superphosphate (TSP). nHAP300 displayed heterogeneous sizes, while nHAP700 were approximately 100 nm in size, with a P content of 8.8% and 19.4%, respectively. Pseudomonas alloputida successfully solubilized both types of nanoparticles, with nHAP700 demonstrating a higher solubility than nHAP300. The TSP treatment resulted in higher P losses (6.35 mg) compared with nHAP treatments (nHAP300 0.32 mg; nHAP700 0.28 mg), indicating the potential of nHAP for recycling P from waste. Our findings indicate that nHAP700 are more efficient in P release than nHAP300 but less prone to leaching compared to conventional fertilizers. Utilizing these nanoparticles enables phosphorus recovery from waste and holds significant potential for sustainable agricultural applications.",

No-till and cover cropping conservation practices have been recommended for reducing erosion and nutrient loss from cropping systems. The overall aims of this study were to characterize and evaluate the effects of fertilizer (placement and source) and cover crop management on P speciation in surface runoff sediments and source soil. In 2014, a field-scale experiment was established in a no-till, corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) cropping system with two cover crop treatments (with and without a winter crop; winter wheat [Triticum aestivum L.], rapeseed [Brassica napus L.], hairy vetch [Vicia villosa Roth], winter triticale [×Triticosecale Wittm.], and cereal rye [Secale cereale L.]) and three P fertilizer management treatments (no P, fall broadcast diammonium phosphate, and spring subsurface injected ammonium polyphosphate). Phosphorus fractionation in the source soil collected in the fall of 2019 and sediment samples collected throughout 2020 were analyzed using a modified sequential P extraction method to evaluate the cumulative effects of imposing the treatment factors over 5 years. The direct P speciation was done using X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. The indirect P speciation (fractionation) results showed that the management practices affected the exchangeable, organic matter-associated, and Fe-bound P fractions in sediments and the exchangeable and residual fractions in source soil. Direct P speciation results showed a depletion of Fe-associated P in soil and sediment from cover crop treatment, suggesting that Fe-associated P species were affected by cover crops. Changes in soil and runoff sediment P speciation would change the proportions and forms of soluble and particulate P in runoff sediments and may influence P bioavailability in aquatic ecosystems. Developing P fertilizer and cropping system management options with an understanding of soil P transformations helps maintain environmental sustainability.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Bacterial infections seriously affect the health of patients and their incidence is very high. Photothermal therapy has shown promising prospects in the treatment of bacterial infections as it can effectively kill bacteria and reduce inflammation. Black phosphorus (BP) is an emerging nanoparticle that can generate heat under the action of near-infrared light, it can safely and effectively kill bacteria through photothermal therapy. In this experiment, black phosphorus was used as a photothermal agent to kill bacteria and strontium ions were loaded onto BP to enhance its stability and antibacterial performance. METHODS: BP was obtained by liquid phase exfoliation and Sr2+ was loaded onto the surface of BP by electrostatic interaction. RESULTS: BP-Sr was synthesized via electrostatic interactions and characterized using various techniques. The cytocompatibility of BP-Sr was evaluated by CCK8 assay and live/dead staining which showed no significant cytotoxicity with a concentration not exceed 50 μg/mL. Meanwhile, the antibacterial effects showed 99% of bacteria died after 10 min under the action of a 2 W/cm2 laser and the structure of bacteria was destroyed. Finally, the transcriptomic results suggest that bacteria death may be related to membrane destruction, metabolic disorders, and transport damage. HE staining and Gram staining also showed that inflammation was significantly alleviated after laser treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings propose a great solution for bacterial infection and also enrich the theoretical framework supporting the application of BP-Sr in the field of antibiosis.",

      "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for more than half of the human population. Rice plants are cultivated in several different environments, and face various abiotic stresses, including nutritional imbalance in soils. The ionome, the inorganic composition of an organism, is known to be tightly regulated, as changes in concentration of one element affect concentrations of others. Iron (Fe) is an essential element that is involved in redox reactions, nitrogen metabolism and chlorophyll synthesis. The hallmark of Fe deficiency in plants is leaf chlorosis, a phenotype known to be alleviated by deficiencies of other elements, such as phosphorus (P). Aluminum (Al) is abundant in soils and limits plant growth in acidic soils. Despite its well-established detrimental effects, Al has been proposed to have a positive effect on growth for some species, but little is known about this phenomenon. Here we aim to understand whether Al affects Fe homeostasis in rice. We found that Al alleviated Fe deficiency-induced chlorosis. +Al-Fe treatment decreased expression of Fe deficiency marker genes and partially recovered photosynthesis. We also observed that Al induced expression of a P deficiency marker gene, and addition of excess P to nutrient solution reversed effects of Al on chlorosis. Our data show that Al alleviates Fe deficiency-induced chlorosis, and suggests that this occurs indirectly by inducing P deficiency in leaves.",

      "abstract": "The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), one of the most important ecological regions in the world, is experiencing a decline in ecological function as a result of severe grassland degradation. Elymus nutans is one of the ecological grass species for restoring degraded grasslands in QTP. The seed yield and seed quality are often limited by soil nutrients in QTP, so it is very important to optimize the application rates of fertilizer for E. nutans seed production. In this study, a \"3414\" fertilization experiment (nitrogen: 0 ~ 225 kg N ha- 1; phosphorus: 0 ~ 180 kg P2O5 ha- 1; potassium: 0 ~ 135 kg K2O ha- 1) was established in the third year of planting E. nutans seed field based on the soil nutrient supply situation in the planting area to explore the effects of combined application of N, P and K fertilizers on the seed yield and seed quality of E. nutans. The results showed that the balanced application of N, P and K fertilizers significantly improved the seed yield, seed quality and seed vigour of E. nutans. The seed yield of E. nutans was regulated by the seed yield components. Under different fertilization treatments, the number of fertile tillers and thousand kernel weight had a greater contribution to seed yield, followed by the number of spikelets per panicle. Compared to the no fertilization treatment, the combined application of N, P, and K fertilizers increased the seed yield of E. nutans by 23.05%-90.49%. The seed size, seed nutrient content, germination percentage and seedling growth of E. nutans were positively affected by the combined application of N, P and K fertilizers. The seed vigour of E. nutans increased by 38.23%-89.85% compared to the no fertilizer treatment. Fertilizer application promoted seed nutrient storage and increased seed size thereby promoting seed germination and seedling growth. The crude protein, soluble sugar and starch content of E. nutans seed increased by 9.70%-54.05%, 6.70%-25.70% and 4.31%-35.88%, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer had a greater effect on seed yield and seed quality of E. nutans than phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. The balanced nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers at an application rate of 150 kg N ha- 1, 120 kg P2O5 ha- 1, 90 kg K2O ha- 1 in the planting area of QTP was found to be the optimum fertilization amount for increasing seed yield, seed quality and net income. This study provides theoretical evidence and certain practical suggestions for sustainable forage seed production in alpine regions of QTP.",

      "abstract": "The need for stringent phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater is increasing to mitigate eutrophication, while efficient phosphate reuse is critical due to the global phosphate crisis. Combining aluminum sulfate (ALS) with high molecular weight organic polymers achieved 95-99% removal of particles, turbidity, and phosphates, reducing ALS usage by 40%. We propose mechanisms to explain the enhanced treatment efficiency. Particle and turbidity removal is more influenced by polymer charge density than molecular weight, while orthophosphate (OP) removal is linked to a change in zeta potential from negative to positive, allowing additional OP binding through complex formation with hydrolysis products and polymers. Enhanced phospholipid (PL) removal likely results from adsorption and neutralization of micelle PL charges by intermediate positively charged aluminum hydroxyphosphate ions. Higher PL removal with low ALS doses is attributed to a two-stage dosing process that optimizes coagulant and polymer dosages. The combined removal of OP and PL improves phosphorus bioavailability, increasing the sludge's fertilizer value.",

      "abstract": "In natural environments, the growth and development of trees are continuously affected by phosphorus (P) starvation stress. However, the mechanisms through which trees balance stem growth and P distribution remain unknown. This study found that in the woody model species poplar, the P loss in stems is more severe than that in roots and leaves under P starvation conditions, thereby inhibiting stem development and reducing the expression of numerous genes related to wood formation, including PagSND1-B1. Intriguingly, overexpression of PagSND1-B1 in poplar enhances resistance to P starvation and promotes xylem development. Further analysis demonstrated that PagSND1-B1 can directly and positively regulate the phosphorus transporter PagPHT1;5a. Analysis of P content changes in leaves, stems and roots of transgenic poplar before and after treatment indicated that overexpression of PagSND1-B1 disrupts the normal P redistribution procedure, leading to increased P accumulation in stems, which is beneficial for xylem development. Therefore, PagSND1-B1 participates in the phosphorus absorption and homoeostasis of poplar by modulating PagPHT1;5a. This study provides valuable insights into the regulatory function of PagSND1-B1 in wood formation and the process by which trees balance phosphorus distribution and xylem development."

However, the direct application of PSB may have minimal significance due to their low survival in soil. Biochar serves as a carrier that enhances microbial survival, and its porous structure and surface characteristics ensure the adsorption of Bacillus megaterium. Inoculating rice husk biochar-immobilized with Bacillus megaterium (BMB) resulted in dissolved inorganic and organic P levels of 39.55 and 31.97 mL L-1, respectively. Subsequently, rice pot experiments were conducted to investigate the response of soil microbial P mobilization and P uptake in rice to fertilizer inputs. The organic fertilizer (OF) combined with BMB treatment (MOF) showed the highest soil available phosphorus (AP) at 38 days, with a value of 7.83 mg kg-1, as well as increased the pqqC abundance while decreasing the abundance of phoD bacterial communities compared with the control. Furthermore, the bioavailable P reservoir (H2O-Pi and NaHCO3-Pi) in soil was greatly increased through the fertilizer input and microbial turnover, with the highest H2O-Pi (3.66 mg kg-1) in OF treatment and the highest NaHCO3-Pi (52.65 mg kg-1) in MOF treatment. Additionally, carbon utilization analysis was applied using the commercial Biolog system, revealing that the MOF treatment significantly increased the utilization of carbohydrates, polymers, and amino acid carbon sources. Moreover, compared to the control, MOF treatment significantly increased the shoot (0.469%) and root P (0.516%) content while promoting root development and thereby supporting rice growth. Our study demonstrates that the MOF treatment displayed higher P levels in both soil and rice plants, providing a theoretical basis for further understanding the role of biochar-based bacterial agents in rice P management."

This is a significant shortcoming, as dissolved phosphorus can promote algae growth in receiving water bodies resulting in negative impacts to human and aquatic health. This study seeks to address this shortcoming through an end-of-pipe filter at the end of bioretention effluent pipes designed to reduce the concentration of dissolved phosphorus. To do so, two filters containing a mixture of activated alumina and iron filings were built and installed at the effluent point of two different bioretention systems in Milwaukee, WI. During runoff events, the filters were sampled during incoming and exiting flows and tested for water quality pollutants. Results demonstrated that the filters reduced the concentrations of both dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations (average of 37% and 29%) and total phosphorus (average of 29% and 24%); however, once in place for several months the reductions in dissolved reactive phosphorus improved to 49% and 39%, on average. This study ultimately presents an approach to overcoming one of the most critical limitations of green stormwater infrastructure, by integrating a final treatment step.",

In pot experiments, these nine strains significantly improved root length, shoot length, chlorophyll content, fresh weight, proline, APX, CAT, GR, NPK, and Zn content in maize plants after 60 days under pathogenic stress. Notably, PSB-25 increased root length by up to 66% under C. chlorophyti stress and 64% under X. axonopodis stress. PSB21 enhanced proline content by 49%, APX by 70%, and GR by 41%, while PSB-16 raised CAT activity by 55% under X. axonopodis stress. Molecular diversity analysis of the 40 PS-RB strains using ERIC, BOX, REP, and ARDRA showed two major clusters with Jaccard coefficients from 0.72 to 1.00. 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified PSB10, PSB16, and PSB25 as Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter sp., respectively. The effects of PSB10, PSB16, and PSB25 on growth parameters under pathogen stress were also studied. Field trials indicated that treatment T6 (100% RDF + PSB16) was most effective in promoting plant growth. Additionally, significant differences in the expression of six Pht1 transporter genes were noted between PS-RB treated and untreated maize seedlings, and these genes improving phosphorus acquisition.",

      "abstract": "Biologically mediated adsorption and precipitation of phosphorus (P) from waste streams can restrict environmental P discharges. Here, we appraise progress in this field over the past decade. The research discipline has grown considerably in recent years. Industry 'wastes', including steel slags, continue to show promise as adsorbents with exceptionally high P retention capacities (>500 mg P g-1). Hydrotalcite, a nanomineral, offers prospects as a P removal technology with imbedded climate change mitigation capacity. Biomineral struvite formation, driven by microbial processes, offers an exciting P removal and recovery approach that can be applied to diverse wastewater types due to its feedstock-independent mechanisms, emerging immobilisation techniques and adaptability to mixed cultures. All of these factors facilitate efficient nutrient recycling and scalable application to the wastewater industry. Adsorbed and precipitated P can be applied to cropland to offset dependence on conventional fertiliser inputs. Therefore, in addition to water treatment, these biologically mediated processes also offer opportunities to support food production. Moreover, as many of the input materials covered in this review are industry byproducts and common organic materials, the removal of P from waste streams by adsorption and precipitation offers strong circularity potential that aligns with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We call for future work to focus on long-term full-scale trials involving community, government and industry partners.",

      "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) has demonstrated potential as a drug carrier and photothermal agent in cancer therapy; however, its intrinsic functions in cancer treatment remain underexplored. This study investigates the immunomodulatory effects of polyethylene glycol-functionalized BP (BP-PEG) nanosheets in breast cancer models. Using immunocompetent mouse models-including 4T1 orthotopic BALB/c mice and MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice, it is found that BP-PEG significantly inhibits tumor growth and metastasis without directly inducing cytotoxicity in tumor cells. Mass cytometry analysis reveals that BP-PEG reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment by recruiting neutrophils. Neutrophil depletion experiments further demonstrate that the antitumor effects of BP-PEG are dependent on neutrophils. Moreover, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing indicate that BP-PEG is mainly taken up by macrophages, leading to the release of inflammatory factors such as IL1A and CXCL2, which enhance neutrophil recruitment and activation, thereby amplifying the antitumor immune response. Finally, co-culture assays confirm that BP-PEG indeed enhances the antitumor activity of neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells. These findings position BP-PEG as an immunomodulatory agent capable of reprogramming the tumor microenvironment to promote innate immunity against breast cancer. By stimulating neutrophil-mediated antitumor activity, BP-PEG offers a unique therapeutic approach that can potentially enhance the efficacy of existing cancer immunotherapies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fritillaria taipaiensis P. Y. Li is a plant used to treat respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and influenza. Its wild resources have become increasingly scarce, and the demand for efficient artificial cultivation has increased significantly in recent years. Phosphorus-solubilizing fungi can promote the dissolution of insoluble phosphate complex, which benefits plant nutrition. Another strategy for efficiently cultivating traditional Chinese medicine plants is to combine the soil with phosphorus-solubilizing fungi to provide nutrients and other desired features. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different phosphorus-solubilizing fungi and their combinations on photosynthesis, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and expression of protective enzyme system-related genes, and to find a reference strain suitable for the artificial cultivation and industrial development of F. taipaiensis P. Y. Li. In this study, the phosphorus-solubilizing fungi isolated from the rhizosphere soil of F. taipaiensis P. Y. Li were applied to the cultivation of F. taipaiensis P. Y. Li for the first time. METHODS: In this study, seven treatment groups (S1-S7) and one control group were set up using indoor pots as follows: S1 (inoculation with Aspergillus tubingensis), S2 (inoculation with A. niger), S3 (inoculation with Aspergillus nigerfunigatus) and S4 (inoculation with A. tubingensis and A. niger), S5 (inoculation with A. tubingensis and A. nigerfunigatus), S6 (inoculation with A. niger and A. nigerfunigatus), S7 (inoculation with A. tubingensis, A. niger, and A. nigerfunigatus), and CK (control group). These strains were inoculated into pots containing F. taipaiensis P. Y. Li bulbs,and the effects of different phosphorus-solubilizing fungi and combinations on the photosynthetic characteristics, basic physiological and biochemical indicators, and differential gene expression of protective enzyme systems in F. taipaiensis P. Y. Li leaves were determined. RESULTS: Most growth indexes showed significant differences in the fungal treatment groups compared with the CK group (P < 0.05). The stem diameter and plant height in the S5 group were the highest, which were 58.23% and 62.49% higher than those in the CK group, respectively. The leaf area in the S7 group was the largest, which increased by 141.34% compared with that in the CK group. Except for intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), the contents of photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetic parameters, and amounts of osmoregulatory substances increased to varying degrees in the fungal treatment groups (P < 0.05). Among these, the S5 group had the highest stomatal conductance index and soluble sugar and free proline contents, whereas S6 had the highest chlorophyll a and soluble protein contents. In addition, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in all inoculation groups was lower than that in the CK group. The MDA content was the lowest in S7, about 44.83% of that in the CK group. The activities of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were higher in all inoculation groups than those in the CK group; the changes in SOD and CAT activities were significant (P < 0.05). The expression levels of FtSOD, FtPOD, and FtCAT in the S5 group were the highest, which were 8.67, 7.65, and 6.08 times of those in the CK group, respectively. CONCLUSION: Various combinations of phosphorus-solubilizing fungi exhibit differential capacities to enhance plant growth indices (including leaf area, plant height, and stem diameter), promote the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments, regulate osmotic pressure, and elevate antioxidant activity. Notably, The three fungal combinations (S7) were prone to cause a certain degree of antagonism, leading to suboptimal performances in certain biochemical indicators, such as free proline and POD levels. Our study pointed out that the S5 group inoculated with A. tubingensis and A. niger had the best overall effect. These experimental results provided a theoretical basis for the selection and development of artificial cultivation of F. taipaiensis P. Y. Li."

      "abstract": "Foliar traits can reflect fitness responses to environmental changes, such as changes in nutrient availability. Species may respond differently to these changes due to differences in traits and their plasticity. Traits and community composition together can influence forest nutrient cycling. We compared five traits-foliar N, foliar P, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and leaf carbon isotope ratio (δ13C)-in six northern hardwood tree species (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharum, Betula alleghaniensis, Betula papyrifera, Fagus grandifolia, and Prunus pensylvanica) in a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization study across 10 mid- and late-successional forest stands in New Hampshire, USA. We also analyzed the response of tree growth to N and P addition. Nutrient addition shifted trait values towards the \"acquisitive\" side of the spectrum for all traits except δ13C, reflecting a tradeoff between water-use efficiency and nutrient-use efficiency. Treatment responses in relative basal area increment revealed that the Betula species were N-limited, but traits of all species responded to either or both N and P addition in ways that suggest N and P co-limitation. Two species displayed lower foliar P under N addition, and three species displayed lower foliar N under P addition, which also suggests co-limitation. These indications of co-limitation were reflected at the community level. Specific leaf area, LDMC, and δ13C differed with stand age within several species. Examining trait responses of tree species and communities to nutrient availability increases our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying the complex effects of nutrient availability on forests.",

      "abstract": "Upgrading wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a global practice for achieving increasingly stringent nutrient discharge objectives set by governments to accommodate population growth and reduce surface water pollution. However, associated downstream improvements in nutrient conditions are difficult to determine in nearshore regions of large aquatic ecosystems due to complex biophysical processes. We conducted a nine-year water quality study and analyzed the data using linear mixed models (LMMs) within a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) framework to assess effects of an upgrade to the Duffin Creek Water Pollution Control Plant (DCWPCP) on surface water nutrient conditions and proliferation of nuisance benthic algae (Cladophora glomerata) in nearshore Lake Ontario. The DCWPCP upgrade resulted in increased effluent concentrations and loads of nitrite+nitrate (NO2+3) due to enhanced nitrification, while reducing total Kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia+ammonium (NH3+4). However, total phosphorus (TP) in effluent only changed slightly due to operational constraints during plant upgrade. For nearshore nutrient conditions, our LMM-BACI framework revealed that, after upgrade, NH3+4 decreased at impact site relative to control sites. In contrast, following upgrade, an observed decline in NO2+3 concentrations was less pronounced at impact site compared to control sites, suggesting increased NO2+3 inputs into nearshore surface water from the DCWPCP. We could not detect obvious improvement in nearshore TP concentrations, stoichiometric ratios of total inorganic nitrogen to TP and NO2+3 to TP, or phosphorus tissue content of Cladophora, likely due to the only slight reduction in TP from the DCWPCP. Overall, our findings showed that the DCWPCP upgrade increased NO2+3 inputs, which could have important implications for nutrient management and trade-offs associated with WWTP upgrades that reduce one chemical species at the expense of another. Other researchers may find our LMM-BACI framework useful to detect localized impacts of nutrient inputs in nearshore and coastal areas where multiple physical and climate drivers influence water quality.",

      "abstract": "Intercropping has the potential to improve phosphorus (P) uptake and crop growth, but the potential benefits and relative contributions of root morphology and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization are largely unknown for the intercropping of rice and soybean under dry cultivation. Both field and pot experiments were conducted with dry-cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) grown alone or intercropped under two P levels. Two root separation modes between rice and soybean were employed to explore the contribution of AMF association and root plasticity on P uptake in intercrops. The results showed that rice/soybean intercropping resulted in a notable increase in the total biomass and yield compared to monoculture in the field. In the potted experiment, compared to the plastic root separation treatment (PS), the no root separation treatment (NS) increased the total biomass and P uptake by 9.4% and 19.9%, irrespective of the P levels. This was primarily attributable to a considerable enhancement in biomass and phosphorus uptake in soybean by 40.4% and 49.7%, which offset a slight decline in the rice of NS compared to PS by 26.8% and 18.0%, respectively. The results of random forest analysis indicate that the P uptake by the dominant species, soybean, was mainly contributed by root morphology, while rice was more dependent on AMF colonization in the intercropping system. Therefore, dry-cultivated rice/soybean intercropping enhances P uptake and productivity by leveraging complementary belowground strategies, with soybean benefiting primarily from root morphological adjustments and rice relying more on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization."

Our results showed that nitrogen and phosphorus supply increased SPAD (leaf greenness, 5.0-29.1%), NSC (non-structural carbohydrates, 14.0-41.2%), nutrient accumulation (nitrogen: 14.1-50.0%, phosphorus: 11.8-41.5%, potassium: 13.7-28.2%), biomass (fresh: 10.8-29.3%, dry: 5.0-22.8%), yield (16.6-30.7%), and harvest index (2.0-9.8%) of sorghum at the maturity stage grown in saline soils but significantly decreased nutrient use efficiency. Combined application showed better performance on these attributes than sole nitrogen and sole phosphorus. The highest seed yield (5919 kg ha-1) was recorded at 180 N kg ha-1 and 60 P2O5 kg ha-1 treatment, while the largest value of dry biomass (18,401 kg ha-1) was obtained at 360 N kg ha-1 and 120 P2O5 kg ha-1 treatment. The Pearson analysis showed that seed yield had the highest correlation with aerial potassium accumulation, while dry biomass had the highest correlation with NSC as well as aerial nitrogen accumulation. A treatment of 180 N kg ha-1 and 60 P2O5 kg ha-1 was recommended to be used in sorghum production in saline soils based on harvest index and nutrient use efficiency."
