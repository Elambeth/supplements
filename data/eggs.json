      "abstract": "This commentary examines a critical paradox in contemporary policymaking that hinders effective action for health equity. On one hand, certain policymakers fixate on economic growth measured by GDP as the solution to societal challenges (putting all their eggs in one basket). Simultaneously, other policymakers acknowledge but ultimately avoid addressing how the economic system fundamentally drives health inequalities (dancing around the elephant in the room). This results in perpetuating a focus on downstream interventions rather than disrupting health's structural and economic determinants. While notable exceptions exist, sustained examples of upstream economic intervention remain scarce. Health promotion practitioners are positioned to challenge this paradox through their core competencies in policy influence, systems thinking, partnership building, and community mobilisation. By supporting policymakers to address power and wealth inequalities that underpin health disparities, health promotion practitioners can help move beyond approaches focused primarily on individual behaviour change. This commentary calls for creative collaborations, new language for conceptualising wellbeing economies, and broader public support to expand what is deemed politically possible in addressing economic causes of health inequalities.",

      "abstract": "Various classes of antibiotics are used to treat guinea fowl diseases in rural Togo. The aim of this study was to assess antibiotic treatment practices and detect the presence of antibiotic residues in eggs from guinea fowl farms in the Savannah region of Togo. The study involved direct interviews using a questionnaire administered to 87 farmers in the Oti, Tone and Tandjoare prefectures, using the Kobocollect tool. Qualitative analysis of the presence of antibiotic residues in guinea fowl eggs was carried out using the Premi®Test collected from farmers. Data were presented as relative frequencies using Excel software and logistic regression analysis and Chi-square test were performed to ascertain positive associations. The minority of farmers (1.15 %) were under the care of a veterinarian, while 87.36 % practiced self-medication and did not respect the prescribed doses of antibiotics, and 11.49 % had no supervision. All the farmers surveyed use plants for therapeutic purposes, without any real knowledge of the correct dosage. Additionally, 56.66 % of farmers did not respect the withdrawal period before guinea fowl eggs are consumed or placed on the market. Furthermore, 49.43 % (Chi-square statistic = 14.92; dof = 2; P = 0.00058) of guinea fowl egg samples analyzed contained antibiotic residues. Biosecurity and confinement were positively associated with the presence of antibiotic residues in eggs. The study reveals inappropriate use of antibiotics by guinea fowl farmers in the Savannah region of Togo, leading to the presence of antibiotic residues in the eggs."

During a 67-day trial, a total of 300 Jingfen 8 laying hens aged 160 days were randomly allocated into four treatment groups: Control (basal diet), Cu (25 mg/kg Cu), BA (500 mg/kg BA), and Mix (a combination of 25 mg/kg Cu and 500 mg/kg BA). The results indicated that the Mix group experienced a significant decrease in egg cholesterol levels, particularly in the yolk cholesterol content, along with an enhancement in the total antioxidant capacity. Additionally, the liver cholesterol metabolism was modulated by upregulation of CYP7A1 and ABCG5, alongside downregulation of SREBP-2 and HMGCR. While Cu and BA individually showed minimal effects on production, their combination yielded a synergistic impact on lipid metabolism and antioxidant defense. However, the Mix group showed reduced liver zinc content, suggesting a Antagonistic relationship between Cu and Zn. These findings suggest that Cu and BA supplementation may enhance egg quality and metabolic health in laying hens, highlighting the importance of maintaining balanced trace element ratios in poultry diets."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a novel, refrigeration-free preservation method to extend quail egg shelf life and enhance consumer safety. The antimicrobial efficacy of limonene vapor against Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. Limonene nanoemulsions (0.04%, 0.08%, and 0.12%) were used to generate vapor for coating eggshells. The coating process was performed using an ultrasonic device with a controllable temperature chamber to maintain different temperatures: 4°C (cold), 25°C (medium), and 37°C (high temperature). The antimicrobial efficacy was enhanced by applying UV irradiation for 10 min. The mode of action was analyzed through bacterial morphology, biofilm formation, and cell leakage. Limonene vapor (0.08%) at 4°C with ultraviolet (UV) reduced Salmonella Enteritidis and S. aureus by 6-7 log10 on eggshells, whereas at 25°C and 37°C, the reductions were only 3.5 log10 and 2.8 log10, respectively. Salmonella was not detected, and S. aureus remained within food safety standards when quail eggs were stored at 30 ± 2°C for 10 days, compared with the control, which showed bacterial growth within one day. Possible mechanisms of action suggested that cold-generated limonene formed a thin film on the eggshell surface. This film caused deformation and abnormal morphology in Salmonella Enteritidis cells and induced pore formation in S. aureus cell walls, enhancing bacterial cell injury. UV exposure further exacerbated cellular damage, resulting in a synergistic antimicrobial effect. However, this method did not cause significant membrane damage or lead to substantial leakage of intracellular materials in S. aureus. This method was cost-effective and could be adapted for on-farm application before distribution, ensuring safer eggs for consumers."

      "abstract": "Hatcheries have been identified as a significant source of Salmonella within poultry production. Consequently, there is a need for effective egg disinfection methods that can reduce the pathogen burden while preserving the egg integrity and embryo. The metrics for a successful egg disinfection method are typically a reduction in Total Aerobic Count (TAC) while retaining hatching rates. In this study, a gas phase hydroxyl-radical process was validated and verified as a hatchery egg disinfection method. The process is based on applying a hydrogen peroxide mist in combination with ozone gas and UV-C to generate antimicrobial hydroxyl radicals. The treatment (2 % hydrogen peroxide, 20 ppm ozone and 19 mJ/cm2 UV-C; designated as HR) for inactivating Salmonella (serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium) inoculated onto eggs could eliminate the pathogen (>5 log CFU/egg reduction) but left residual TAC (1.53 log CFU/egg reduction). Surface sterilization was achieved by a pre-treatment of eggs with the photo-catalyst riboflavin (13.75 mM) followed by 3 % hydrogen peroxide delivered at 70 °C prior to the hydroxyl-radical treatment (3 % hydrogen peroxide, 20 ppm ozone and 114 mJ/cm2 designated HRS). The surface sterilization of eggs coincided with the removal of the cuticle layer with the HRS treatment but not HR. The cuticle layer was also compromised by formaldehyde treatment. When the different treatments were applied to fertile hatchery eggs (n=50 eggs per treatment group), there was no significant difference in hatchery rate (64-74 %), with hatch to fertility being higher for disinfected eggs (89-97 %) compared to the non-treated control (80 %). The seven-day mortality (0 - 2 birds) and feed conversion ratio (1.59 - 1.75 kg/kg feed) did not significantly differ between the treated vs controls. The HR treatment could eliminate Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli (>5 log CFU/egg reduction) although HRS was required to inactivate Pseudomonas aeruginosa (>5 log CFU/egg reduction) and reduce Aspergillus niger spores (3.08±2.25 log CFU reduction). The study has provided treatment options for hatchery egg disinfection and alternative to formaldehyde treatment."

In this study we aimed to employ an easily repeatable soil sampling methodology to identify differences in contamination levels between and within parks. Egg density was found to differ significantly between parks and park entrances were the most heavily contaminated locations within parks, followed by playgrounds. Species confirmation by polymerase chain reaction was conducted on a proportion of the recovered eggs and identified most as T. canis (n=36) while three eggs were identified as T. cati. These results indicate that dogs are responsible for the majority of environmental contamination in Dublin City parks, with the highest levels of contamination found around park entrances.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of antibiotics in food-producing animals for infections treatment, metafilaxis and, although not allowed in Europe, as growth enhancer is responsible for the presence of antibiotic residues in animal derived foodstuffs. For this reason, it is very important to perform a monitoring. METHODS AND RESULTS: Muscle samples from bovine, pig, poultry, turkey and fish, as well as bovine milk and hen's egg samples, deriving from 444 farms of both Umbria and Marche regions (Italy) were analyzed by well-established and validated analytical methods in order to evaluate the presence or not of antibiotic residues (penicillins, quinolones, tetracycline and sulphonamides). The samples were collected during 2012-2021 period of time. In total, 15/2,354 samples resulted positive to the analyses. The amount of antibiotics found in the 15 samples resulted below the maximum residue limit fixed by EU Regulation 37/2010 and for this reason considered compliant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite irregular samples were not found, the presence of antibiotic residues in foodstuff represents a risk for public health as they are responsible for the selection of resistant strains contributing to antimicrobial resistance problem spread. In the present work, this aspect was evaluated in relation to the results obtained from the analyzed samples coming from Umbria and Marche regions.",

In this study, spotted lanternfly and spongy moth eggs were exposed to various temperature-exposure time (35 to 70 °C and 15 to 135 min) treatments in the laboratory. Spotted lanternfly egg masses were collected from various sites in 2022 and 2023, while the spongy moth egg masses were obtained from lab-reared colonies. Heat treatments were applied using an Isotemp microbiological incubator in the spring of 2023 and the spring and fall of 2024. No eggs of either species hatched when exposed to temperatures ≥ 60 °C for durations longer than 15 min. Spotted lanternfly egg hatch declined at temperatures ≥ 45 °C, while reduced hatch of spongy moth eggs was not observed until temperatures reached ≥ 50 °C. The season (spring or fall) in which the eggs were heat treated did not affect the hatch rate of spotted lanternfly eggs; however, spongy moth eggs were more vulnerable in the fall than in the spring. These findings suggest that heat treatment regimes that are already being used to kill insects in wood may effectively kill the eggs of both species on various substrates and that protocols for killing eggs at lower temperatures on more sensitive substrates may be possible by using longer-duration exposures.",

We analyzed the metabolite profiles of three kinds of eggs using an untargeted metabolomics-based approach to better understand the differences in metabolites among pigeon, chicken, and quail eggs. Then, we quantitatively validated the differences in abundance of partial metabolites through a targeted metabolomics-based approach. A total of 692 metabolites were identified in the three types of eggs. A total of 263 significantly differentially abundant metabolites were found between pigeon eggs and chicken eggs, and 263 significantly differentially abundant metabolites were found between pigeon eggs and quail eggs. The metabolites that were significantly more abundant in pigeon eggs than in other eggs were mainly lipids, lipid-like molecules, nucleosides, nucleotides, and their analogues. We identified the eight metabolites that were significantly greater in abundance in pigeon eggs than in chicken eggs and quail eggs and quantitatively validated the differences in abundance of these metabolites. Our study demonstrates that there are more functional components in pigeon eggs than chicken eggs and quail eggs, especially for the prevention and treatment of various disordered glucose and lipid metabolism-related diseases. The discovery of these differentially abundant metabolites paves the way for further research on the unique nutritional functions of pigeon eggs and the further utilization of pigeon egg products."

In the present article, we find that it is possible to cook albumen and yolk at two temperatures without separation by using periodic boundary conditions in the energy transport problem. Through mathematical modeling and subsequent simulation, we are able to design the novel cooking method, namely periodic cooking. Comparison with established egg cooking procedures through a plethora of characterization techniques, including Sensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy, confirms the different cooking extents and the different variations in protein denaturation with the novel approach. The method not only optimizes egg texture and nutrients, but also holds promise for innovative culinary applications and materials treatment."

WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT?: This was a case of foodborne botulism in Weihai caused by homemade pickled eggs contaminated with C. botulinum. Five individuals presented with symptoms, while three were asymptomatic. All patients received botulinum antitoxin treatment, and no deaths occurred. During this outbreak, 12 isolates of C. botulinum were obtained. The phylogenetic analysis results revealed that all the isolates came from the same origin. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE?: This outbreak indicated that foodborne botulism remains a public health issue in China. We need to strengthen publicity and education efforts to inform people of the potential risk of botulism associated with consuming homemade traditional pickled foods. Heating and boiling homemade foods thoroughly can destroy toxins and prevent foodborne botulism."

A total of 240 healthy Taihang chickens, aged 180 days, were randomly divided into eight groups of 30 birds each. The first seven groups were administered oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, erythromycin, tylosin, tylvalosin, lincomycin, and tiamulin, respectively, in accordance with the maximum dosages and longest durations of treatment recommended by the Veterinary Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. Group 8 served as the control group, and the test period continued until no drug residue could be detected. The results demonstrate that the residues of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tylosin, tylvalosin, and tiamulin throughout the test period were below the maximum residue limits (MRLs) outlined in GB 31650-2019, \"National food safety standard-Maximum residue limits for veterinary drugs in foods\". The egg yolk was identified as the target tissue for estimating the withdrawal time periods (WDTs) of these seven drugs. It was thus concluded that the recommended withdrawal time for tiamulin should be 0 days. However, the WDTs of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tylosin, tylvalosin, were 2.8, 0.3, 2.4, and 7.4, respectively, when the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was found to be lower than the MRLs. It was thus determined that the recommended WDTs for oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tylosin, and tylvalosin should be 3, 1, 3, and 8 days, respectively. In contrast, erythromycin and lincomycin exhibited concentrations below the permitted MRLs on days 7 and 8, respectively. However, the upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for erythromycin and lincomycin were found to be below the MRLs when the WDTs were 11 and 8.9, respectively. This suggests that the recommended WDTs for these two antibiotics should be 11 days and 9 days."

METHODS: Sediment samples from 14 sites in UdonThani municipality were determined for O. viverrini eggs. Human fecal samples and fish were examined for opisthorchiasis and metacercaria infection, respectively. Water samples were analysed for faecal coliforms bacteria. From 2017 to 2023, transmission control efforts were evaluated by monitoring changes in human and fish infection rates. RESULTS: In 2017 and 2018, O. viverrini eggs were found in canal sediments at 153 and 86 eggs/liter, respectively. Human opisthorchiasis prevalence was 5.3%, with cyprinoid fish showing a 25.0% infection rate (11.6 cysts/infected fish) and significant fecal contamination (>5,500 CFU/100 ml). Conversely, egg-negative sites showed a 0.5% human infection rate and no metacercariae were found. After health interventions (2019 to 2023), O. viverrini eggs were not detected in sediments from canals, resulting in a significant reduction in human opisthorchiasis prevalence to 0.9% at the previously egg-positive site and from 12.2% to 1.7% in downstream communities (p < 0.001). Additionally, the prevalence of metacercariae in cyprinoid fish decreased from 11.4% (7.6 cysts/infected fish) to 4.5% (2.4 cysts/infected fish), indicating reduced transmission. CONCLUSION: The presence of O. viverrini eggs in sediment was associated to human opisthorchiasis transmission and demonstrated the significant effectiveness of health interventions in controlling the disease.",

      "abstract": "Natural conception in women after the age of 45 years is rare. The probability of successful pregnancy in this specific group of women after IVF and embryo transfer with autologous oocytes is also reduced. In addition, advanced maternal age is associated with an increased risk of aneuploidies and other associated complications during pregnancy. Generally, women who are over 44 years old are advised to receive IVF treatment with donated oocytes due to poor oocyte quality and low ovarian reserve. Although IVF outcomes in women of advanced age can be associated with the best prognosis when donated oocytes are used, IVF is not always well accepted by infertile couples. This is a case report of a woman who achieved a clinical pregnancy and live birth in her first attempt at IVF treatment with her own eggs and a euploid embryo at 48 years and 10 months, respectively, at the time of oocyte retrieval. This case demonstrates that limited attempts at assisted reproductive technology with older women's own eggs may be an option in specific cases.",

      "abstract": "Developing animals are increasingly exposed to elevated temperatures as global temperatures rise as a result of climate change. Vertebrates can be affected by elevated temperatures during development directly, and indirectly through maternal effects (e.g. exposure to prenatal glucocorticoid hormones). Past studies have examined how elevated temperatures and glucocorticoid exposure during development independently affect vertebrates. However, exposure to elevated temperatures and prenatal corticosterone could have interactive effects on developing animals that affect physiology and life-history traits across life. We tested interactions between incubation temperature and prenatal corticosterone exposure in the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We treated eggs with high or low doses of corticosterone and incubated eggs at 23°C (cool) or 28°C (warm). We measured the effects of these treatments on development time, body size and survival from hatching to adulthood and on adult hormone levels and mitochondrial respiration. We found no evidence for interactive effects of incubation temperature and prenatal corticosterone exposure on phenotype. However, incubation temperature and corticosterone treatment each independently decreased body size at hatching and these effects were sustained into the juvenile period and adulthood. Lizards exposed to low doses of corticosterone during development had elevated levels of baseline corticosterone as adults. Additionally, lizards incubated at cool temperatures had higher levels of baseline corticosterone and more efficient mitochondria as adults compared with lizards incubated at warm temperatures. Our results show that developmental conditions can have sustained effects on morphological and physiological traits in oviparous lizards but suggest that incubation temperature and prenatal corticosterone do not have interactive effects.",

A randomised controlled trial was conducted in Jouberton, South Africa, among 500 infants randomly assigned equally to either an intervention group receiving a daily chicken egg or a control group. Both groups were followed up for 6 months. Data on infant and maternal sociodemographic information and anthropometric status of infants were collected. EED and inflammatory markers were analysed using Q-Plex Human EED (11-Plex) assay. There was a significant reduction in fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) concentration in the intervention group (B = -0.132; 95% CI -0.255, -0.010; p = 0.035). Baseline, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was positively associated with endpoint length-for-age z-score (LAZ), weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) and weight-for-length z-score (WLZ) and there was an inverse relationship between baseline FGF21 and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) with endpoint growth indicators. Baseline IGF-1 was positively associated with reduced odds of wasting, stunting and being underweight (p < 0.001) and baseline FGF21 was associated with increased odds of stunting (p = 0.002), wasting (p = 0.031) and being underweight (p = 0.035). There was a 20% increased odds of stunting with baseline I-FABP (p = 0.045) and a 30% increased odds of being underweight with baseline soluble CD14 (p = 0.039). Complementary feeding with eggs decreased growth hormone resistance (reduced FGF21 levels); however, FGF21 and I-FABP levels were linked to increased growth faltering.

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of paraformaldehyde levels on the disinfection of fertile eggs from breeders intended for vaccine production. A total of 4,368 fertile eggs were divided into seven treatment groups: nondisinfected eggs and eggs disinfected with 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 g/m³ of paraformaldehyde. Disinfection was carried out by fumigation, followed by incubation. On the 10th day of incubation, various parameters were measured, including egg mass loss, absolute and relative weights of the embryo and yolk sac, embryo length, embryonic mortality, and fertility. Bacterial counts were also assessed at three points: before disinfection, one hour after disinfection, and on the 10th day of incubation. Results showed that eggs disinfected with paraformaldehyde had significantly lower bacterial counts compared to nondisinfected eggs. One hour after disinfection, treatments without fumigation or those with fumigation without paraformaldehyde exhibited 100% of bacterial counts exceeding 300 CFU, while the treatment with 2 g/m³ of paraformaldehyde had 83.33% of bacterial counts exceeding 300 CFU. Higher paraformaldehyde levels significantly reduced bacterial counts, with the treatment of 3 g/m³ being the most effective, where only 8.33% of samples had bacterial counts exceeding 300 CFU. The optimal concentration for achieving the lowest bacterial counts was estimated to be 6.07 g/m³. In terms of egg mass, nondisinfected eggs experienced greater mass loss compared to fumigated eggs. Additionally, the best embryo length was observed at a concentration of 2.67 g/m³ of paraformaldehyde. Based on these findings, it is recommended to use 6.07 g/m³ of paraformaldehyde to effectively reduce bacterial contamination in fertile eggs used for vaccine production.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Accurate and rapid diagnosis is crucial for the effective treatment of parasitosis. Traditional etiological methods, especially microscopic examination, are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to false or missed detections. In response to these challenges, this study explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for the detection and classification of human parasite eggs through the YOLOv4 deep learning object detection algorithm. METHODS: Eggs from species such as Ascaris lumbricoides (A. lumbricoides), Trichuris trichiura (T. trichiura), Enterobius vermicularis (E. vermicularis), Ancylostoma duodenale (A. duodenale), Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum), Paragonimus westermani (P. westermani), Fasciolopsis buski (F. buski), Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis), and Taenia spp. (T. spp.) were collected and prepared as both single species and mixed egg smears. These samples were photographed under a light microscope and analyzed using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) v4 model. RESULTS: The model demonstrated high recognition accuracy, achieving 100% for Clonorchis sinensis and Schistosoma japonicum, with slightly lower accuracies for other species such as E. vermicularis (89.31%), F. buski (88.00%), and T. trichiura (84.85%). For mixed helminth eggs, the recognition accuracy rates arrived at Group 1 (98.10, 95.61%), Group 2 (94.86, 93.28 and 91.43%), and Group 3 (93.34 and 75.00%), indicating the platform's robustness but also highlighting areas for improvement in complex diagnostic scenarios. DISCUSSION: The results show that this AI-assisted platform significantly reduces reliance on professional expertise while maintaining real-time efficiency and high accuracy, offering a powerful tool for the diagnosis and treatment of parasitosis. With further optimization, such as expanding training datasets and refining recognition algorithms, this AI system could become a key resource in both clinical and public health efforts to combat parasitic infections."

The experimental results were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using biooptical microscope observation and incubation at constant temperature and humidity post-treatment. The findings revealed that with an output voltage of 22.8 kV, the delivery speed of 0.024 m/s, and the electric field frequency of 3.8 Hz, the unhatched rate of the eggs was 68.14 % while the survival rate of the larvae was 20.36 %.

The duration of egg dissemination after surgical treatment is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify, quantify, and verify the duration of the elimination of D. renale eggs in dog urine after the surgical removal of nematodes. The study involved 15 dogs in which female specimens of D. renale were detected in kidneys. Urine samples, preferably first-morning urine samples, were collected before and for the first ten days after nephrectomy. For egg quantification, 40 µL samples of urinary sediment were analyzed in triplicate. In laboratory analyses, between 900 and > 6,000 eggs/urine sample were detected in 86.7% of the dogs prior to surgery, and in 40% of the dogs on postoperative day 1. Of the 15 dogs evaluated, 14 (93.3%) eliminated D. renale eggs on each of the first ten postoperative days. Egg elimination peaked on postoperative day 1. Our results indicate that dogs can continue to be sources of D. renale infection even after the helminths have been removed from a parasitized kidney, underscoring the novelty of these findings and their importance for the One Health approach.",

It interacts with specific sites on cell membranes in an essential process for transferring lipids. The lipophorin receptor is the protein responsible for the interaction between lipophorin and cell membranes. In the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus, much information on the interaction of lipophorin with organs is available. However, molecular data on the lipophorin receptor and its functions is still needed. Here, we explored lipophorin receptor gene expression and functions using a functional genomics approach. The R. prolixus genome encodes seven genes from the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, including a single ortholog of the lipophorin receptor. All organs analyzed (anterior and posterior midguts, fat body, ovaries, and flight muscle) expressed this gene. In the fat body, blood-feeding strongly reduced lipophorin receptor gene expression. Lipophorin receptor knockdown by RNA interference delayed egg laying and reduced the triacylglycerol in laid eggs without altering lipid stores in the fat body or lipid levels in the hemolymph. In the ovaries, lipophorin receptor knockdown reduces the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and a fatty acid synthase while altered the gene expression profile in the fat body, causing an increase in the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and a reduction in Brummer lipase and vitellogenin 2. RNA interference treatment reduced the hatching of the eggs, causing the collapse and darkening of the laid eggs, in addition to the hatching of deformed first-stage nymphs. Furthermore, the structure of the chorion showed distortions in patterns and cracks and reduced hydrocarbon levels. These results show that the lipophorin receptor alone is not essential for lipid physiology in R. prolixus. However, this protein plays a fundamental role in the viability of eggs and, consequently, in insect reproduction.",

Radio frequency (RF), a means to pasteurize eggs without affecting quality, is a novel option based on fast volumetric heating; however, there is scarce information about the quality of such treated food. This research consisted in a comprehensive quality study on eggs treated with RF. The RF system was operated at 40.68 MHz, 40 W and 16 W (8 min total), and 42 rpm. The quality assessment included the determination of Haugh unit, yolk index, compression strength, albumen turbidity, albumen and yolk pH, and yolk color. Additional analyses were conducted to quantify the mineral composition of the eggshell (40.68 MHz, 40 W, 42 rpm, 5.5, 8.5, and 10 min); these samples were observed by SEM. The results showed that RF did not significantly (p > 0.05) change any quality parameters. The mineral composition remained constant in processed eggs. The SEM images of RF-treated eggs showed some smooth spots; however, these areas could exist due to the high variability of the eggshells. RF is an option to process intact eggs, maintaining their fresh quality and keeping the integrity of the eggshell to ensure the food safety of the internal egg components."

The intervention group had a ~ 5% higher incidence of gastrointestinal morbidity (17.0%) compared to the control group (11.9%). Gastrointestinal morbidity without fever tended to be 1.4 times higher in the intervention group (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.93; P = 0.058) and tended to be 4 times higher with fever (OR: 4.07, 95% CI: 0.86, 19.23; P = 0.077). The duration of total gastrointestinal and respiratory morbidity was 1.5 days longer in the intervention group (β: 1.491; 95% CI 0.064, 2.918; P = 0.041). Complementary feeding with eggs may have contributed towards an increased risk for gastrointestinal morbidity.",

METHODS: The collection of plant material was performed as described in previous reports. The dried material was macerated with ethyl acetate. Ovicidal assays were performed at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/L A. ludoviciana extract. Bioassays of fasciolicidal efficacy in adult specimens of F. hepatica were performed at extract concentrations of 125, 250, 375 and 500 mg/L. The effects of triclabendazole, a reference drug, and artemisinin were also evaluated. RESULTS: The ovicidal effectiveness of the extracts obtained after 16 h of incubation at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/L was 48%, 52%, 87%, 89% and 92%, respectively (p < 0.05), and the fasciolicidal efficiencies during the first 24 h post-treatment ranged from 82 to 100% (p < 0.05). In both cases, scanning electron microscopy revealed damage to the shells of the eggs treated with the extract, compromising their stability. In adult fasciolae, alterations to the integument that resulted in its erosion and detachment were observed. Histopathological studies of the affected specimens revealed damage to the tegumentary and subtegumentary cells and alterations in the ovaries, testicles and intestine. This damage was more severe after treatment with the extract than after treatment with the other compounds. METHODS: Extract of A. ludoviciana causes damage to the tegument, intestine, ovaries, testes and eggs of F. hepatica.",

      "abstract": "More than 10 years ago, the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) published guidelines for the management of egg allergy [1]. For the first time, these included a stepwise plan for the reintroduction of egg for egg-allergic children who could already tolerate well-cooked egg, such as cakes and cookies. Since then, various egg ladders have been developed [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In the past 3 years, several studies have been published suggesting that a gradual introduction of highly processed to less processed egg containing foods contribute to the acceleration of tolerance development [2, 3, 4, 5]. However, depending on the study and egg ladder, the egg products vary in their level of processing (wheat matrix, degree, and location of heating (e.g., oven, pan, pot), egg quantity, and egg protein). In the UK, the introduction of the egg ladder is recommended at the age of 12 months or if the last reaction occurred 6 months before. The benefits of introducing egg at home include an early increase in the variety of foods, reduction of food fears, improved nutrient intake, and the avoidance of hospitalization fears in children [10]. Children with mild reactions in the past can start with small amounts of baked goods at home. Food challenges in an inpatient setting to exclude or reconfirm the allergy should be conducted if the patients have previously had severe allergic reactions, i.e., anaphylaxis, or if the smallest amounts triggered an allergic reaction or if existing asthma is poorly controlled [10, 11]. The present work includes, in addition to the evaluation of study results, a presentation of the recent studies regarding egg ladders. From these, a new egg ladder as therapeutic option for the German-speaking region has been developed. As already done for the milk ladder a detailed step-by-step plan, selection criteria, a recipe collection, and also ideas for commercial prepackaged food items can be found in the appendices [11]."

      "abstract": "Thiamine deficiency is a large contributor to reduced reproduction success among salmonids throughout the northern hemisphere. In Scandinavia, this reproduction disorder is known as M74; while in North America, it is known as early mortality syndrome (EMS). The disorder fluctuates in magnitude from year to year. During years with high prevalence of the disorder, salmonid hatcheries that stock various aquatic systems to maintain the population size experience difficulties filling their quotas without thiamine treatment of alevins. The disorder is monitored both by observing the survival rate and by measuring the thiamine content of prefertilized eggs in the hatcheries. Here, a simple extraction procedure is presented, which allows for quantitative determination of the various phosphorylated forms of thiamine using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry but also allows for extraction in 96 deep-well plates and measurement of the total thiamine content using fluorescence monitoring with a plate reader, following oxidation of thiamine to thiochrome. The latter procedure could also be integrated into a highly portal system where the thiochrome is determined using the DeNovix QFX analyzer. The newly developed extraction procedure and cleanup method for fluorescence measurement represent the most versatile and simple methods to date for monitoring of thiamine in salmonid eggs. The methods produced accurate and precise data with quantification limits below the limit where the deficiency causes 100% lethality."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of insufficiently treated wastewater or Faecal sludge in agriculture raises concerns because of the pathogen content. Helminth eggs (HE) are one of the most crucial pathogens for ensuring public health and safety. Widely used disinfection treatment methods do not guarantee the complete inactivation of helminth eggs. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of anaerobic digestion and electrochemical process on helminth ( Ascaris suum) egg inactivation. METHODS: Lab-scale biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay was conducted by spiking A. suum eggs in a serum bottle. Total solid (TS), volatile solid (VS), pH, biogas production and its composition, and volatile fatty acids (VFA) were analyzed along with A. suum inactivation every third day for the initial 15 days and fifth day for 45 days. In the second set of experiments, a hypochlorite (4700 ppm) solution was generated by electrolysis of aqueous NaCl solution in a membrane-less electrochemical cell. The hypochlorite was diluted (940, 470, 235, and 156ppm) in wastewater, spiked with A. suum eggs and then examined for inactivation at regular intervals. RESULTS: The results of the anaerobic digestion treatment documented 98% inactivation of A. suum eggs (0.15 eggs/mL) in 35 days and remained at 0.14 eggs/mL until day 45. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between non-viable eggs and pH and a negative relationship with all the other parameters. Electrochemical treatment achieved 10% inactivation at 940 ppm concentration in 24h. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the inactivation of A. suum eggs by anaerobic digestion or electrochemical treatment is a combined effect of more than one parameter.",

      "abstract": "Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae convert wastes into protein, playing a vital role in addressing the challenge of sustainable poultry production. These larvae accumulate toxic substances, posing a risk to feed and food safety. This study investigates the effects of substituting soybean meal with different levels of BSF larvae meal on laying performance, egg quality, serum analysis, and the deposition of various metals in eggs, meat, and excreta. A total of 1,008 Lohmann hens (age 48 wk) were randomly assigned to 4 treatments. The treatments consisted of corn-soybean meal (CK) diet replaced with 7% (BSF7), 14% (BSF14), and 21% (BSF21) BSF larvae meal. Each treatment consisted of 6 replicates with 42 hens each and the trial lasted for 8 wk. Dietary BSF larvae meal treatments increased (linear, P < 0.05) the laying rate (1.52 to 1.95%) and decreased (linear, P < 0.01) the feed intake (3.64-3.86 g) during the entire experiment. During 48 to 52 wk, egg weight was decreased (P < 0.001) 0.93 g for the BSF21 group compared to CK group, however, during 52-56 wk, no differences in egg weight were observed among treatments. The addition of BSF larvae meal enhanced the eggshell strength (linear, P < 0.05), with no effect on the albumen height and yolk weight (P > 0.05). Low transfer of arsenic, lead, and cadmium concentration was observed in the egg yolk and egg white across different treatments (P > 0.05). Conversely, the concentrations of these metals and iron showed an increase, while Zinc exhibited a decrease in excreta as the dietary intake of BSF larvae meal increased. The chromium and iron increased linearly (P < 0.001) in the egg white with the inclusion of BSF larvae meal. Egg white iron and chromium showed a strong positive correlation with the dietary zinc and copper. Taken together, BSF larvae can replace soybean meal completely in laying diet, however, careful attention requires to elevated metal levels in diet and excreta.",

Molecular docking results indicated that the three main egg proteins and FQs were bound by hydrogen bond, van der Waals force, and alkyl groups, leading to the loss of FQs response signal, and then produced ME. After trichloroacetic acid treatment, the mean particle size of egg matrix decreased, the protein secondary structure changed, and the crystal structure was destroyed. The corresponding ME of the supernatant obtained by centrifugation was only 0.7 %. The standard addition experiment confirmed that the proposed pretreatment method improved the accuracy and reliability of the fluorescence probe. This work is helpful to promote the practical application of fluorescence analysis in the rapid monitoring of food safety hazard factors.",

Our study has identified two species of parasite, the protozoan Liburna oophaga sp. nov. and the metazoan Ikanecator primus, that co-infect cuttlefish eggs, increasing mortality and reducing hatching rates. L. oophaga sp. nov. is reported here for the first time to enhance mortality during the incubation period by inducing deformity in cuttlefish eggs. We investigated the application of peracetic acid to parasite elimination during cuttlefish egg incubation. When cuttlefish eggs were treated with a peracetic acid containing product (PAA-product); 35 mg/L PAA + 15 mg/L H2O2, L. oophaga on the surfaces of the eggs were eliminated within 10 min. PAA-product; 70 mg/L PAA + 30 mg/L H2O2 was required to achieve the same effect for I. primus. Immersion treatment with PAA-product at 70 mg/L PAA + 30 mg/L H2O2 reduced parasitic load and improved survival of cuttlefish embryos and hatchling size, demonstrating that PAA product can inhibit and control parasitic co-infections in cephalopod culture.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus in chicken egg, meat and faeces from four districts of Bangladesh. A total of 120 chicken samples were collected from different poultry farms. Conventional culture and molecular detection methods were used for identification of bacterial isolates from the collected samples followed by antibiotic susceptibility test through the disc diffusion method, finally antibiotic resistant genes were detected by PCR. E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in meat, egg and faecal samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility results revealed isolates from faeces were 100 % resistant to amoxicillin, while all S. aureus and Salmonella sp. from faeces were resistant to doxycycline, tetracycline and erythromycin. Salmonella spp. isolates from eggs indicated 100 % resistance to erythromycin, amoxycillin, while E. coli were 100 % resistant to erythromycin. E. coli and S. aureus from meat were 100 % resistant to amoxicillin and erythromycin. However, Salmonella spp. from eggs were 100 % susceptible to doxycycline, gentamicin, levofloxacin and tetracycline. The mecA and aac(3)-IV genes were only found in S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. The Sul1, tetB, and aadA1 were highest in Salmonella spp. and S. aureus, while the sul1, tetA and bla SHV were higher in E. coli. Isolates from all samples were multidrug resistant. These findings indicate a high risk of transmission of resistance genes from microbial contamination to food of animal origin. The study emphasizes the need for effective biosecurity measures, responsible antibiotic use, and strict regulations in poultry production to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance."

However, less is known about how social variables impact the speed at which females grow ovarian follicles in preparation for ovulation. We hypothesized that the social environment would influence how long ovarian follicles remain in rapid yolk deposition before reaching the size necessary for ovulation. For 8 d, we tested the effects of three types of social interactions: no social engagement (control), engagement with the same four females (social group 1), or engagement with the same four females plus six randomly selected roosters (social group 2). Starting on day 5 of engagement, we collected eggs and measured egg and yolk masses and yolk diameters. Then we stained the yolks with potassium dichromate to quantify the number of days the ovarian follicle spent accumulating yolk. We compared the results of the treatment groups with those of the control hens that were kept in individual laying cages throughout the study. The number of eggs laid, the yolk mass, and the yolk diameter did not differ among any of the three groups, but hens exposed to both females and males produced yolks with significantly more rings than hens in the other groups. Thus, the presence of males appeared to lengthen the time it took for ovarian follicles to reach the size needed for ovulation but did not result in larger or heavier yolks.",

Moreover, the prevalence of oral mucosal fibrosis and recurrent aphthous stomatitis among male doctors and nurses in China was 21.24 % and 24.27 %, respectively. Our previous study has shown that the ethanol extract of Kaempferia galanga L. rhizome (EKGR) revealed an accelerated wound-healing effect in the oral mucosa ulcer of Wistar rats. This study aims to explore the effects of EKGR on the expression of NF-kappaB-p65 and COX-2 in the tongue tissue of male Wistar rats by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry technique, its safety towards the vascular membrane of the egg chorioallantoic membrane, and its single-dose application on the skin of male rabbits. The rats were randomly assigned into 7 groups: the normal control; the negative control; the positive control (treated with triamcinolone acetonide); and 4 treatment groups of EKGR (0.5 %; 1 %; 2 %; 4 %). Western blot and immunohistochemistry methods were used to measure the expression of NF-kappaB-p65 and COX-2. The hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane assay was employed to predict the safety of EKGR towards the vascular membrane. Moreover, the effect of 200 mg/kg BW EKGR application on the dorsal skin of male albino rabbits was also evaluated. EKGR inhibits the expression of NF-kappaB-p65 and COX-2 as proven by WB and IHC results. In the HET-CAM assay, all concentrations of EKGR do not induce irritation responses, which elicits the safety of EKGR. The administration of EKGR causes mild irritation to the dorsal skin of male rabbits but does not induce erythema and edema, no significant changes in BW, no toxic effects on organ macroscopic examination or histopathology, and does not induce abnormalities in the hematological profile of male albino rabbits. EKGR has confirmed its anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing the expression of COX-2 and NF-kappaB-p65 in the oral mucosa ulcer of Wistar rats. EKGR is safe as it does not exhibit irritating potential and harmful effects."

This study investigates the potential of phage vB_SPuM_SP02 (SP02) as a novel disinfectant for breeder eggs contaminated with S. Typhimurium SM022. Phage SP02 was isolated from poultry farm effluent and characterized for morphology, biological properties, and genome properties. Experimental groups of specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs were treated with Salmonella and phage SP02, and efficacy was assessed through hatching rates, chick survival, weight, Salmonella load, immune organ indices, and intestinal flora. Phage treatment effectively eradicated Salmonella contamination on eggshells within 12 h, resulting in increased hatching and survival rates compared to controls. Furthermore, phage treatment mitigated weight loss and tissue Salmonella load in chicks without causing immune organ damage while reducing Salmonella spp. abundance in the intestinal tract. This study demonstrates the potential of phage SP02 as an eco-friendly and efficient disinfectant for S. Typhimurium-contaminated breeder eggs, offering promising prospects for practical application in poultry production.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) concentration method is commonly used in routine clinical practice to detect parasite eggs in feces. This procedure involves extraction of oil with the organic solvent ethyl acetate (EA), which reduces fecal sediment and provides a cleaner background for microscopic analysis. However, clinically, some sediment failed to float after EA treatment. METHODS: Hexane, commonly used in the food oil extraction from oilseeds did not float the feces. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that neither the amount of the oil nor the classes of the oil determined was differed whether hexane or EA was used to float the feces. Oil red, Bodipy and Calcofluor staining showed that the unabsorbed oil droplets in the fecal sediment were trapped within the leaf structure. HCl or acetic acid was added to see if the acid residue could dissolve the cellulose of the leaf to promote the bulk float. RESULTS: Our result showed that the fecal bulk contained the loosened mesophyll cell wall. The addition of acid residues improved fecal bulk float. The proximity of cellulose fiber to EA, but not hexane, may enhance the efficacy of oil extraction from cellulose. CONCLUSION: This is the first report that the interaction of cellulose with ethyl acetate in fecal solution has an effect on bulk float. This study improves the understanding of fecal bulk flotation and may assist in the visualization of parasite eggs in clinical practice with non-floating fecal samples in the FEA concentration method.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of bile acids (BAs) supplementation on fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS), production performance, and physiological and quality characteristics of laying hen eggs. Sixty Sanhuang laying hens, aged 28 weeks, were randomly allocated to six dietary treatments over a 4-week period, including the control (CON) group (feeding basal diet), the high-fat diet (HFD)-treated group (basal diet containing 10% soybean oil), and HFD supplemented with 0.01% and 0.02% of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) groups. Production performance, egg quality, liver morphology, serum biochemical indexes, antioxidant capacity, proinflammatory cytokines, and intestinal microbiota were evaluated. The average body weight in 0.01% CDCA was larger than in the HFD group (p < 0.05). Eggshell Thickness in the CON group was greater than in the HFD, 0.01% CDCA, and HDCA groups (p < 0.05). Albumen height in the 0.02% HDCA group was higher than the HFD group (p < 0.05). Eggshell weight in the HFD group was less than the CON group (p < 0.05). Haugh unit (HU) in the HDCA group was larger than the HFD group (p < 0.05). Albumen weight in the 0.02% HDCA group was greater than the CON and HFD groups (p < 0.05). In the HFD group, the levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipo-protein cholesterol (LDL-C) were surpassing the other groups (p < 0.05). The levels of catalase (CAT) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in the HFD group was smaller than the other groups (p < 0.05). The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the HFD group was higher than in the other groups (p < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were larger in the HFD group than in the other groups (p < 0.05). The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated significant variations in the relative abundance of specific bacterial populations among the different treatment groups. The treatment and CON groups exhibited a higher presence of bacteria that inhibit host energy absorption or promote intestinal health such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Ruminococcus, whereas the HFD group showed an increased prevalence of potentially pathogenic or deleterious bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio spp. In conclusion, the supplementation of BAs in poultry feed has been demonstrated to effectively mitigate the detrimental effects of FLHS in laying hens. This intervention regulates lipid metabolism, bolsters antioxidant defenses, reduces inflammation, and modulates the gut microbiota, offering a novel perspective on the application of BAs in the poultry industry."

      "abstract": "Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) is a safe and effective disinfectant, but its sterilizing efficiency is compromised by organic matter on the egg surface. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) is a harmless cleaner with a decontamination effect on a variety of surfaces and can be used to remove organic matter. This study assesses the effectiveness of a combination of ERW and SAEW in eliminating Salmonella and manure mixture from egg surfaces, as well as its impact on egg quality during storage. The results show that ERW (74.14%) was more effective than deionized water (DW, 64.69%) and SAEW (70.20%) (P < 0.05) in removing manure from egg surfaces. The damage to the cuticle of eggshell treated with ERW for 28 s was similar to that of DW (P > 0.05) and less than that of SAEW (P < 0.05). Spraying ERW for 10 s followed by SAEW for 18 s (ERW + SAEW) completely removed Salmonella from the egg surface, with no bacteria detected in the residual wash solution. Additionally, ERW + SAEW demonstrated superior preservation of egg quality during storage at 25℃ than the control and ERW single treatment (P < 0.05). Moreover, ERW + SAEW resulted in less weight loss compared to SAEW single treatment (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the sequential use of ERW and SAEW appears to be a promising approach for sterilizing eggs. It not only removes organic matter and Salmonella from the egg surface but also improves the preservation quality of the egg at 25 ℃.",

The diapause overwintering strategy is one of the important reasons for the large population of this pest. This study investigated the function of the genes associated with the release of diapause (DIB, JHE and CAM) in Calliptamus italicus by RNA interference (RNAi) technology to aid in its biological control. RESULTS: The expression levels of DIB and its downstream-associated genes (EcR and FTZ-F1) in the eggs injected with dsDIB for 12 h decreased by 96.6%, 55.8% and 81.8%, respectively. Diapause began to terminate on day 3, and development was almost complete on day 6. However, the head was significantly smaller. The expression levels of JHE and its downstream-associated genes (JHEH and VgR) at 48 h after dsJHE treatment decreased by 76.5%, 85.6% and 85.9%, respectively. The termination of diapause occured on day 3 of incubation. The development was basically complete on day 6, but the yolk had been incompletely absorbed. The expression of CAM and its downstream-associated genes (CAMK4 and MYL) at 24 h after dsCAM treatment decreased by 42.4%, 95.3% and 82.7%, respectively. Diapause termination was completed on day 4 for incubation, and development was abnormal on day 6. The absorption of yolk was incomplete. CONCLUSION: DIB, JHE and CAM can delay the diapause termination of Calliptamus italicus eggs to different degrees and can be developed as potential target genes for its biological control. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Nevertheless, information about pathogens and diseases that may affect squid aquaculture remains sparse. In this study, we identify new parasitic copepod species that causes squid mortality and decreases squid hatching rates, and we also offer a solution to eliminate the pathogen during incubation of squid eggs. The newly discovered copepod Ikanecator primus gen. et sp. nov. was identified on oval squid eggs for the first time using both morphological and molecular diagnostic markers. In the genomes of the copepod and associated microbiome, we identified multiple genes for enzymes involved in cephalopod eggshell degradation in genomes of the copepod and associated microbiome. Furthermore, we conducted experiments to assess efficacy of peracetic acid in inhibiting the I. primus gen. et sp. nov. both in vitro and in vivo using immersion treatment. We established that a 2-min exposure to a concentration of 250 μl/L of peracetic acid containing product (PAA-product; 35 mg/L PAA and 15 mg/L H2O2) inhibited the development of nauplii in vitro. All parasites exposed to a concentration of 500 μl/L of PAA-product (70 mg/L PAA and 30 mg/L H2O2) were eliminated within two minutes. On top of this, the immersion treatment with 500 μl/L of PAA-product (70 mg/L PAA and 30 mg/L H2O2) improved survival of squid embryos and increased size of squid hatchlings compared with control and the immersion treatment with 125 μl/L of PAA-product (17.5 mg/L PAA and 7.5 mg/L H2O2) and the immersion treatment with 250 μl/L of PAA-product (35 mg/L PAA and 15 mg/L H2O2). These findings suggest that PAA holds a great potential as inhibitor and controller of parasitic copepod infections and for overall health management in cephalopod culture.",

Five quicklime concentrations (trial II; 50, 30, 20, 10 and 5%) were used to treat sand. The effect of liming on larval cultures was assessed by measuring embryonic development. Filariform larvae were exposed to 20% quicklime (25 °C and 37 °C, 20 min). Heat treatment destroys Ancylostoma spp. eggs and prevents in vitro larval development. Liming at 50, 30, and 20% concentrations made embryonic development impossible. However, filariform larvae treated with 20% lime solution retained their motility. Heating at 70 °C and liming at 20% were sufficient to make Ancylostoma spp. egg embryogenesis impossible in experimentally contaminated sand samples.",

The aim of this study is to explore the ability of ozone and peroxone to disinfect drinking water contaminated samples with Toxocara canis eggs. The oxidants used were ozone and ozone-hydrogen peroxide combination. The treatment of Toxocara canis eggs was carried out in a 50 ml reactor with an operating volume of 10 ml. The pH conditions (5, 7 and 10) were varied for each treatment. The treatment effect was calculated by counting eggs and examining the condition of the larvae larval condition (whole, broken and hatched larvae) using an optical microscope. The experiment was carried out by exposing the eggs for 60 and 120 minutes to ozone and peroxone. The best results were obtained for helminths treated with the ozone/hydrogen peroxide combination at pH 10, with an inactivation of 79.2%. The synergistic effect of ozone combined with hydrogen peroxide allows higher helminth egg inactivation rates, demonstrating that advanced oxidation processes are a real alternative to apply in the inactivation of Toxocara canis eggs. The results obtained in this study show that the ozone and peroxone treatment could be a useful disinfection process to destroy or inactivate Toxocara canis eggs in processes commonly applied in water treatment.",

      "abstract": "This investigation aimed to evaluate the impact of immersion (IM) riboflavin treatment on the hatchability, production efficiency, and carcass characteristics of Japanese quail eggs. A total of 260 eggs of Japanese quail birds were used for hatching and were randomly divided into 4 treatments with 5 replicates (13 eggs/replicate) in a fully randomized design. Hatching eggs were immersed in riboflavin for 2 min before incubation. The experiment treatments were designed as follows: G1 control group with no treatment, G2 treated with 3 g/L vit. B2 (IM), G3 treated with 4 g/L vit. B2 (IM) and G4 were treated with 5 g/L vit. B2 (IM). After hatching, 128 Japanese quail chicks, aged 7 d, were randomly grouped into 4 treatment groups, with 32 birds in each group. When quails were given vitamin B2 via immersion, they demonstrated significant enhancements in live body weight, body weight gain, feed consumption, and feed conversion ratio at different stages compared to the control group. Compared to control and other groups, the carcass parameters of Japanese quails given a 4 g/L immersion solution showed a significant improvement (P < 0.05). Hatchability and fertility (%) were considerably raised by Vit.B2 treatments of 3, 4, and 5g; the group immersed in 5 g/L had the highest percentages compared to the other groups. Furthermore, treated chickens with all concentrations of vitamin B2 had significantly higher blood indices than the controls. During the exploratory phase (1-6 wk) of age, the highest returns were reported in G4 treated with 5g/L vit. B2 (IM). Treating Japanese quail eggs with different dosages of vitamin B2 by immersion may be recommended to improve their productive and reproductive performance, blood indices, carcass traits, and economic efficiency.",

In this study, we found that the intraperitoneal immunization with Schistosoma japonicum eggs prior to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) application significantly ameliorated the symptoms of DSS-induced acute colitis, which was characterized by higher body weight, lower disease activity index score and macroscopic inflammatory scores. We demonstrated that the immunomodulatory effects of S. japonicum eggs were accompanied by an influence on gut microbiota composition, abundance, and diversity, which increased the abundance of genus Turicibacter, family Erysipelotrichaceae, phylum Firmicutes, and decreased the abundance of genus Odoribacter, family Marinifilaceae, order Bacteroidales, class Bacteroidia, phylum Bacteroidota. In addition, Lactobacillus was identified as a biomarker that distinguishes healthy control mice from DSS-induced colitis mice. The present study revealed the importance of the gut microbiota in S. japonicum eggs exerting protective effects in an experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) model, providing an alternative strategy for the discovery of UC prevention and treatment drugs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Kato-Katz method is a commonly used diagnostic tool for helminth infections, particularly in field studies. This method can yield inaccurate results when samples contain eggs that are similar in appearance, such as Minute Intestinal Fluke (MIF) and Opisthorchis viverrini (OV) eggs. The close resemblance of eggs can be problematic and raises the possibility of false diagnoses. The objectives were to compare the diagnostic performance of the Kato-Katz method for accurately identifying MIF and OV and to provide evidence of possible misclassification.  Methods: Based on questionnaire responses from 15 (young parasitologists and public health staff), the test comprised 50 MIF egg images and 50 OV egg images, for a total of 100 Google Form questionnaires. RESULTS: The morphology of MIF and OV eggs found size and shape similarity and found that the shoulder rims were small, while the OV egg found the knobs had disappeared. The opercular conjunction was apparent, the shoulder rims and miricidium were prominent. The average percentage of correctly classified infections was 61.6 ± 12.1%. The accuracy percentages for both public health staff and young parasitologists in identifying were found to be 59.0 ± 14.8 and 66.8 ± 2.8, respectively. There was no significant difference observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the need for improving the accuracy of parasite identification. Preserving stool samples before the Kato-Katz method can help mitigate the potential degradation or distortion of parasite eggs. The incorrect classification of both eggs had an impact on treatment plans and the policy of parasite control programs.",

      "abstract": "The parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni is a potent inducer of type 2 immune responses by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs) to prime T helper 2 (Th2) responses. We previously found that S. mansoni soluble egg antigens (SEA) promote the synthesis of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by DCs through ERK-dependent signaling via Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 that subsequently induces OX40L expression, licensing them for Th2 priming, yet the ligands present in SEA involved in driving this response and whether specific targeting of PGE2 synthesis by DCs could affect Th2 polarization are unknown. We here show that the ability of SEA to bind Dectin-2 and drive ERK phosphorylation, PGE2 synthesis, OX40L expression, and Th2 polarization is impaired upon cleavage of high-mannose glycans by Endoglycosidase H treatment. This identifies high-mannose glycans present on glycoproteins in SEA as important drivers of this signaling axis. Moreover, we find that OX40L expression and Th2 induction are abrogated when microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES) is selectively inhibited, but not when a general COX-1/2 inhibitor is used. This shows that the de novo synthesis of PGE2 is vital for the Th2 priming function of SEA-stimulated DCs as well as points to the potential existence of other COX-dependent lipid mediators that antagonize PGE2-driven Th2 polarization. Lastly, specific PGE2 inhibition following immunization with S. mansoni eggs dampened the egg-specific Th cell response. In summary, our findings provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms underpinning Th2 induction by S. mansoni and identify druggable targets for potential control of helminth driven-Th2 responses.",

METHODS: A total of 288 26-week-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens (initial body weights 1.65 ± 0.10 kg) with a similar weight and genetic background were used. A completely randomized design divided the birds into a control group and three treatment groups. Each group consisted of six replicates, with twelve chickens per replicate. Initially, all birds were fed a basal diet for 1 week. Subsequently, they were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0, 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg FA in a premix for a duration of 6 weeks. RESULTS: Supplementation of FA could significantly (p < 0.05) enhance the FA content in egg yolks, particularly when 10 mg/kg was used, as it had the most effective enrichment effect. Compared to the control group, the Glu content in the 10 and 15 mg/kg FA groups showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease. Additionally, the contents of Asp, Ile, Tyr, Phe, Cys, and Met in the 15 mg/kg FA group were significantly (p < 0.05) lower compared to the other groups. Adding FA did not have significant effects on the levels of vitamin A and vitamin E in egg yolk, but the vitamin D content in the 5 and 10 mg/kg FA groups showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase. Furthermore, the addition of FA did not have a significant effect on the levels of Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn in egg yolk. The dietary FA did not have a significant effect on the total saturated fatty acids (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content in egg yolk. However, the total monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content in the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups significantly (p < 0.05) increased. These changes in nutritional content might be attributed to the increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) protein content. The significant decrease in solute carrier family 1 Member 1 (SLC1A1), solute carrier family 1 Member 2 (SLC1A2), and solute carrier family 1 Member 3 (SLC1A3) gene expression compared to the control group appeared to be the reason for the decrease in amino acid content in egg yolk within the dietary FA group. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the appropriate addition of FA can enhance the levels of MUFA and vitamin D in egg yolks, thereby improving their nutritional value. Excessive intake of FA can decrease the effectiveness of enriching FA in egg yolk and impact the enrichment of certain amino acids. The yolk of eggs produced by adding 10 mg/kg of FA to the feed contains the optimal amount of nutrients. This study informs consumers purchasing FA-fortified eggs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Selenium is an essential mineral for poultry. The conflicting reports about its in ovo injection are the justification for the more detailed investigation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of in ovo injection of organic selenium on the hatching traits of broiler chickens and their performance. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty eggs of Ross 308 strain with an average weight of 65 g and 160 chicks were randomly divided into 4 treatment groups (each with 8 replicates of 10 eggs each for hatching parameters and 4 replicates of 10 chicks for broiler farming parameters): negative control (no injection), positive control (in ovo injection of 0.272 mL of normal saline solution) and 2 selenium treatments (in ovo injection of 2.72 or 5.44 μg of organic selenium). Injection was into the amniotic sac on the 10th day of incubation. Effects of in ovo injection on hatching and performance traits, blood parameters, immune responses, carcass characteristics, meat fatty acid profile, cecal microbial population and selenium consternation in the tibia were measured. RESULTS: Fewer chicks from the injected treatments hatched than from the negative control group (p < 0.01). However, the injection of selenium increased feed intake and the final weight of the birds (p < 0.01). Blood parameters were also affected. Glucose and cholesterol in experimental treatment chicks was lower than those of the controls (p < 0.01), whereas blood lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL and HDL) and the ratio of cholesterol to HDL was significantly increased in the treatments injected with selenium (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the immune response or microbial population between the experimental groups, but carcass components, such as thigh, breast, wing and abdominal fat weight, were significantly greater in the selenium treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-egg injection of organic selenium produced favourable effects on performance of broiler chickens, although it had no effect on immune response or microbial population. However, the negative effect on hatching of chickens needs to be prevented to result in an acceptable economic return for the producer.",

This would result in an accumulated surplus of unused frozen eggs in fertility clinics worldwide, which represents a promising source of donation to infertile women undergoing IVF treatment. Rigorous and comprehensive counseling is needed, because the process of donating one's unused surplus frozen eggs involves complex decision-making. Prospective EEF donors can be broadly categorized into those who have achieved motherhood and those who remained childless and have given up on motherhood aspirations. A two-step systematic counseling protocol is proposed. Firstly, it is imperative to verify and ensure that these women do not want to conceive any children with their surplus frozen eggs before proceeding with further counseling and signing of consent forms. Secondly, various motivating and dissuading factors in the donation of unused surplus frozen eggs should then be comprehensively discussed with egg freezers to facilitate informed decision-making. Key motivating factors for donation include reciprocity in wanting to share the joys of motherhood among egg freezers who already have children, goodwill to help others in need, and avoiding the wastage of surplus frozen eggs after expending so much money, time, and effort. Key dissuading factors include fear of accidental incest between natural and unknown donor-conceived offspring, as well as apprehension of unexpected future contact with unknown donor-conceived offspring due to either donor anonymity being abolished in their jurisdiction or widespread consumer DNA testing."

The objective of this study was to explore the effects of dietary oregano oil (275 mg/kg; ORE) versus an unsupplemented control diet (CON) on laying hens on the shelf life and fatty acid profile of eggs.2. Treatments were randomly distributed into 10 pens containing 27 birds each. A total of 200 eggs were collected from both groups on the same day and were stored for either 0, 10, 21 and 35 d. At each storage time, egg yolks were analysed for fatty acid profile and lipid peroxidation.3. The main indicator of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde (MDA), was significantly lower in ORE eggs compared to CON eggs (p = 0.001). Storage time had a significant impact on MDA concentrations (p = 0.023), with the highest found after 35 d. Significant differences were found for individual fatty acids, saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid were significantly lower in ORE eggs compared to CON eggs (p < 0.05). Palmitoleic acid (p = 0.002), linolenic acid (p = 0.001) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in ORE eggs.4. Storage only affected oleic, linolenic, linoleic, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids (p < 0.05). Total SFA, MUFA, n-6 and ratio of n-3 to n-6 (n-3:n-6) PUFA were significantly higher in CON eggs (p < 0.05). The ratio of SFA to PUFA (SFA:PUFA, p = 0.005) and total n-3 PUFA (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in ORE eggs.5. The n-3:n-6 ratio was significantly impacted by treatment (p = 0.021) and storage (p = 0.031) with no significant interaction. This ratio is important for human health indication and could lead to the development of designer eggs.",

This study aims to examine the impact of an egg intervention in children, along with behaviour change communication (BCC) to the mother, on linear growth and cognition, and nutritional status in children aged 9-18 months. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A 9-month open-labelled randomised controlled trial will be conducted in three urban slums in Hyderabad, India, as a substudy of an observational cohort study (n=350) following pregnant women and their children until 18 months of age in a population at risk of stunting. The children born to women enrolled during the third trimester of pregnancy will be block randomised in a 1:4 ratio into the intervention (n=70) and control (n=280) groups. Children in the intervention group will be supplemented with one egg per day starting from 9 months until 18 months of age. BCC designed to enhance adherence to the intervention will be used. The control group will be a part of the observational cohort and will not receive any intervention from the study team. The primary outcome will be length-for-age z-scores, and the secondary outcomes will include cognition, blood biomarkers of nutritional status including fatty acid profile and epigenetic signatures linked with linear growth and cognition. Multivariate intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted to assess the effect of the intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Institutional ethics committees of ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated to policy-makers. Findings will also be shared with study participants and community leaders.

However, in severe circumstances when pest insects exceed threshold limits, insecticides may still need to be implemented. Thus, understanding the effects of insecticides on biocontrol agents, such as parasitoid wasps, is paramount to ensure sustainable agroecosystems. Sublethal effects of the bioinsecticide spinosyn, a mixture of the bacterial Saccharopolyspora spinosa (Mertz and Yao) fermentation products spinosyn A and D, on eggs of Trichoplusia ni (Hübner), a cruciferous crop pest, and its egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae (Bezdenko) was investigated. RESULTS: The LC50 for spinosyn A and D (dissolved in ethanol) on T. ni eggs is 54 ng mL-1. Transcriptomics on caterpillars (1st and 3rd instars) that hatched from eggs treated with sublethal concentrations of spinosyn identified the upregulation of several genes encoding proteins that may be involved in insecticide resistance including detoxification enzymes, such as cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases and esterases. Sublethal T. ni egg treatments did not affect parasitoid emergence, however, there was a marked increase in the size of T. brassicae hind tibia and wings that emerged from spinosyn-treated eggs. CONCLUSIONS: For the caterpillar, treatment of eggs with sublethal concentrations of spinosyn may induce insecticide resistance mechanisms. For the parasitoids, their increased size when reared in spinosyn-treated eggs suggests that the emerged wasps may have higher performance. © 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Broken eggs are a byproduct of the poultry industry and a potential nitrogen source for mushroom cultivation. However, its feasibility needs to be evaluated experimentally. METHODS: In this study, a series of different addition amounts (0, 1.8, 3.6, 5.3 and 8.5%, w/w) of broken egg mixture (BEM) were applied in the composting cultivation process of oyster mushroom. The physicochemical properties and bacterial communities of composting substrate, and agronomic and nutritional properties of fruiting bodies were determined. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results showed that the BEM addition significantly (P < 0.05) increased the total nitrogen content in the composted substrate, and the contents of crude protein, total amino acids and essential amino acids of mushrooms. The P3 treatment (initial C/N of 26:1) showed the highest biological efficiency (BE) of 100.19% and a low contamination rate (CR) of 7.00%, while the higher dosage of BEM (P4 and P5) led to a sharp decrease in BE and a sharp increase in CR. High throughput sequencing revealed that the addition of BEM significantly (P < 0.05) changed the bacterial communities in the substrate at the beginning of composting. Streptococcus and Lactococcus were predominant bacterial genera in BEM treatments at the beginning stage of composting, while Acinetobacter became predominant at the ending stage. The co-occurrence network analysis showed that the P3 treatment demonstrated a much more complex bacterial community. The structural equation model analysis indicated that the addition of BEM affected the bacterial communities and nitrogen metabolism during composting, which further affected agronomic and nutritional properties of oyster mushrooms. An appropriate amount of BEM combined with composting processes can significantly improve the yield and quality of oyster mushroom, providing a new way for efficient utilization of BEM."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Assisted Reproductive Technology utilizes human sperm, eggs, or embryos in vitro to produce pregnancy. However, there is no evidence of the acceptance of these technologies by the community. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of positive attitudes toward the acceptance of donor eggs, embryos, and sperm. METHODS: The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (number: CRD42022348036). The Condition, Context and Population (CoCoPop) protocol of the systematic review was used to address the relevant questions regarding the objective of the study. Data were extracted into Excel and pooled estimates were calculated using STATA Version 16. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of positive attitudes toward accepting donor eggs, embryos, and sperms was 38.63%, 33.20%, and 31.34%, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of positive attitudes toward accepting donor eggs was high in non-Asian countries (47.78%) and among infertile men (38.60%). Similarly, the pooled prevalence of positive attitudes toward accepting donor eggs was high in non-Asian countries (47.78%) and among infertile men (28.67%). However, the pooled prevalence of positive attitudes toward accepting donor sperm was high in non-Asian countries (37.6%) and among infertile women (28.19%). CONCLUSION: The pooled estimate of the prevalence of positive attitudes toward accepting donor eggs was higher than the prevalence of positive attitudes toward accepting donor embryos and sperm. Infertile men and non-Asian countries have a higher prevalence of positive attitudes toward accepting eggs and embryos, whereas non-Asian countries and infertile women present a higher prevalence of positive attitudes toward accepting donor sperm. Therefore, regulatory bodies and policymakers should modify their rules and regulations to ensure the availability of minimum standards for the ethical and safe practice of donor conception as a treatment for infertility at national and international levels.",

      "abstract": "Egg products after thermal treatment possess a unique flavor and are favored by consumers. In this study, the key aroma-active compounds of egg yolk products and their formation mechanism during thermal treatment were investigated. The volatile aroma compounds in egg yolks were monitored using an electronic nose, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS), and the lipid molecular species were explored using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry with a Q-Exactive HF-X Orbitrap (UPLC-Q-Exactive HF-X). A total of 68 volatile compounds were identified. Boiled eggs mainly derived their flavor from hexanal, 2-pentyl-furan, 2-butanone, 3-methyl-butanal and heptane. Meanwhile, fried eggs relied mainly on 14 compounds, the most important of which were 2-ethyl-3-methyl-pyrazine, 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-pyrazine, nonanal and 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl-pyrazine, providing a baked and burnt sugar flavor. A total of 201 lipid molecules, belonging to 21 lipid subclasses, were identified in egg yolks, and 13 oxidized lipids were characterized using a molecular network. Phosphoethanolamines (PEs) containing polyunsaturated fatty acids were the primary flavor precursors contributing to the development of egg yolks' flavor, participating in lipid oxidation reactions and the Maillard reaction and regulating the production of aldehydes and pyrazine compounds. This study provides reference and guidance for the development of egg yolk flavor products."

A total of 960 eggs on the seventh day of incubation were randomly divided into 6 groups (160 eggs/group) with 4 replicate of 40 eggs in each. A 3 × 2 factorial arrangement experiment was performed and included 3 sources in ovo feeding with a mixture of trace elements (Zn, Fe, and Cu), including 0 mg/egg, 50 mg TES/egg, and 50 mg TEM/egg with egg irradiation using 0 and 0.2 Gy from GR. Eggs injected with 50 mg TEM/egg and exposed to 0.2 Gy from GR (TEM/GR) was significantly (P ≤ 0.05 and 0.01) higher in hatchability, hatch body weight, and relative organ weight (liver, gizzard, proventriculus, heart, and intestine). The obtained results indicated significant (P ≤ 0.05) decreased in the serum concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in TEM/GR group. There was significant (P ≤ 0.05) increased of catalase (CAT) activity and the concentrations of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in TEM/GR group; however; total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) was significant (P ≤ 0.05) increased in CT/GR group. Serum concentrations of immunoglobulin M (IgM) (P ≤ 0.05) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were increased in the TEM/CR group; the concentration of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) significant (P ≤ 0.05) increased in the TEM/GR group; and interleukins (IL6 and IL10) showed no significant differences among the groups. Our results showed increase in thyroxine and myostatin concentrations with TES/CR and CT/GR of our study groups, respectively. The relative mRNA expression levels of the GH, IGF-1, and Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS) genes were significantly (P ≤ 0.05 and 0.01) upregulated in the liver tissue of the TEM/GR group compared with the other groups. In conclusion, TEM/GR was the best treatment for improving prehatch quality, increasing serum antioxidant enzyme activities, and promoting the expression of growth and immune genes in fertilized quail eggs.",

This study aimed to compare the effects of sodium selenite (SS), yeast selenium (SY), and methionine selenium (SM) at selenium levels of 0.15 mg/kg and 0.30 mg/kg on production performance, egg quality, egg selenium content, antioxidant capacity, immunity and selenoprotein expression in laying hens. The trial was conducted in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, and a total of 576 forty-three-wk-old Hyland Brown laying hens were randomly assigned into 6 treatment groups, with diets supplemented with 0.15 mg Se/kg and 0.3 mg Se/kg of SS, SY and SM for 8 wk, respectively. Results revealed that SM increased the laying rate compared to SS and SY (P < 0.05), whereas different selenium levels had no effect. Organic selenium improved egg quality, preservation performance, and selenium deposition compared to SS (P < 0.05), while SY and SM had different preferences for Se deposition in the yolk and albumen. Also, organic selenium enhanced the antioxidant capacity and immune functions of laying hens at 0.15 mg Se/kg, whereas no obvious improvement was observed at 0.30 mg Se/kg. Moreover, SY and SM increased the mRNA expression of most selenoproteins compared to SS (P < 0.05), with SM exhibiting a more pronounced effect. Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive association between glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPx2), thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs), selenoprotein K (SelK), selenoprotein S (SelS), and antioxidant and immune properties. In conclusion, the use of low-dose organic selenium is recommended as a more effective alternative to inorganic selenium, and a dosage of 0.15 mg Se/kg from SM is recommended based on the trail conditions.",

Until now, the control of this pest has been based on conventional methods, with the application of chemical insecticides being the primary option. However, the wide distribution of H. halys, in combination with the large area of tree fruit production in Greece, raise the need for alternative control methods. In this study, we investigated the possibility of implementing microbial control agents for managing H. halys. Eggs and nymphs of H. halys were treated with 15 native entomopathogenic fungal isolates and their virulence was evaluated in the laboratory. After treatment, egg hatching time was recorded for 7 days and ranged from 4.5 to 7.0 days. Nymphal survival was recorded daily for 7 days following application and ranged from 2.1 to 6.6 days for second instar nymphs and 3.7 to 6.8 days for fourth instar ones. Beauveria varroae isolate displayed the highest toxicity to all H. halys stages that were tested and could be considered a promising biocontrol agent of this insect.

Fluctuation of egg nutrient content by season is relatively unknown, which may influence international food composition databases and outcomes in intervention studies using egg supplementation. To better interpret the findings of The Saqmolo' Project, we conducted comprehensive nutrient analyses on eggs produced during the wet and dry seasons in the highlands of central Guatemala. We randomly collected 36 shell eggs from a local farm during both seasons, hard-boiled, and prepared them for transport to the United States, where they were pooled and assessed for their nutrient composition. Methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, the American Oil Chemists Society, and the American Association of Cereal Chemists were utilized to determine total energy, moisture, ash, total protein, total fat, fatty acids, total carbohydrates, 12 vitamins, 11 minerals, and carotenoids, by season, in some instances with modifications. Differences in nutrient composition between de-shelled hard-boiled eggs collected between seasons were assessed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's family error rate comparison test. Most nutrients in eggs produced in the highlands of central Guatemala differed negligibly (but statistically significantly) based on seasonality. Only vitamins A and E, folate, choline, and calcium fluctuated at clinically significant levels relative to the AI/RDA for infants 7-12 months. Total energy, protein, trans fatty acids, moisture, and vitamin D3 levels did not differ between seasons (p > .05). Further multi-year sampling is needed to examine how seasonal variation affects the nutrient composition of eggs. These data may be used to supplement existing national and regional food composition databases."

      "abstract": "Eggshell cuticles are first lines of defense against egg-associated pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE). Infections from eggs contaminated with this strain remain a significant risk. In addition, changes in the cuticle are closely related to changes in egg safety. The emerging non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma technology enables a high rate of microbial inactivation at near-ambient temperatures, making it ideal for food safety applications. This study examines the effects of a cold atmospheric pressure air plasma jet (CAAP-J) on eggshell cuticle and egg quality whilst inactivating SE. Shell eggs inoculated with SE (7 log10 cfu/egg) were used as the samples to test the decontamination performance of the device. The tests were conducted using an industrial CAAP-J with different power levels (600-800 W), exposure times (60-120 s), at a fixeddistance of 20 mm from the plasma jet and an air flow rate of 3600 L/h. It was found that the best results were obtained after 120 s at maximum plasma power (800 W). Subsequent to the implementation of this plasma procedure, it was determined that no viable cells could be detected. After CAAP-J treatment, the temperature remains below 50.5 °C, thereby minimizing the risk of altering egg quality. All specific measurements (egg white pH, yolk pH, yolk color, HU, and eggshell breaking strength) have shown that CAAP-J treatment has no negative effect on egg quality. No changes in eggshell cuticle quality after CAAP-J treatment was confirmed through scanning electron microscope (SEM).",

      "abstract": "Eggs represent a significant vehicle for Salmonella Enteritidis with the pathogen being transferred to chicks in the hatchery, or to consumers via table eggs. In the following, the efficacy of a gas-phase hydroxyl-radical process for decontaminating hatchery and table eggs was evaluated. Recovery of Salmonella was maximized through holding eggs in tryptic soy broth containing 20% w/v glycerol for 1 h prior to plating. By using this technique, it was possible to recover 63% of the theoretical Salmonella inoculated onto eggs. The continuous hydroxyl-radical reactor consisted of a bank of UV-C lamps (254 nm) that generated hydroxyl-radicals from the degradation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mist and ozone gas. The optimal treatment was defined as that which supports a 5 log CFU/egg reduction of Salmonella without negatively affecting egg quality or leaving H2O2 residues. A process of 2% v/v H2O2 delivered at 30 mL/min with a UV-C dose of 19 mJ/cm2 and ozone (20 ppm) with a total treatment time of 10s was selected. The egg quality metrics (Haugh value, yolk index, albumin pH, yolk pH) did not negatively differ over a 35-day shelf-life at 4 or 25℃ compared to washed eggs or nontreated controls. The cuticle layer of eggs remained intact following hydroxyl-radical treatment. Fertilized eggs (n = 61) treated with the hydroxyl-radicals exhibited the same hatchery rate (75%) as nontreated controls (71-79%) with no defects (unhealed navels or red hocks) being observed. The same hydroxyl-radical treatment could be applied to table eggs to support >5 log CFU/egg reduction of Salmonella and was compatible with egg washing regimes practiced in industry. In comparison, the egg washing process based on sodium hydroxide and chlorine supported a 2.76 ± 0.38 log CFU/egg reduction of Salmonella. The hydroxyl-radical treatment represents a preventative control step to reduce the carriage of Salmonella on hatchery and table eggs.",

      "abstract": "The study aims to evaluate dichromatic light with different intensities during incubation on pre- and post-hatch performance of Japanese quail. In completely randomized design, 600 quail hatching eggs were evenly divided into 4 treatments, 3 replicates, and 50 eggs in each. These eggs were provided with lighted incubation [dichromatic light; green-red (GR) with three different intensities 150, 250, and 350 lx] with lighting schedule (12L: 12D), and one treatment was the complete dark period during incubation and considered as control group. After hatch, 300 quail chicks were equally divided into four treatments (3 replicates and 25 chicks in each). Effects of GR light with different intensities during incubation were evaluated on hatching traits and post-hatch performance of Japanese quails. Regarding hatching traits, hatchability was better in all the treated groups (150, 250, and 350 lx of GR light during incubation) compared to complete dark. In terms of embryonic mortality, early embryonic mortality was lower in the 250 lx group, mid embryonic mortality in dark, and late embryonic mortality in the 150 lx group. Furthermore, an ideal chick spread and growth performance (weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and liveability) was reported in 250 lx group compared to other treated groups. Serum chemistry values were higher in dark group compared to 150, 250, and 350 lx groups. Pre-slaughter weight was higher in 250 and 350 lx group than 150 lx and dark group, whereas carcass weight was better in 350 lx group compared to dark. In conclusion, stimulation of dichromatic light (green + red) at 250 lx to Japanese quail eggs positively influenced hatching traits and post-hatch growth performance of Japanese quail.",

      "abstract": "Pomacea canaliculata was by far one of the most harmful invasive organisms in the world, causing serious harm to aquatic crops and ecosystem. Calcium carbonate is a common component of aquatic environment, which is important for the growth of Pomacea canaliculata. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the response characteristics of P. canaliculata suffered shell breakage to the addition of calcium carbonate in water environment. In this experiment, we explored the effects of calcium carbonate addition on the P. canaliculata shell repair rate, food intake, egg production, shell strength, and calcium content through breaking the snails shell and the addition of calcium carbonate treatment. The results showed that snail broken-shell repaired mostly within 21 days. The snails experienced a significant increase in shell repair rates during earlier days of the treatment, especially for female snails. Food intake of snails exhibited different patterns when their shells were broken and calcium carbonate was added. Shell breakage treatment combined with calcium carbonate addition significantly increased the diameter of snail eggs compared with the control and the calcium carbonate addition treatment without shell-broken snail group. There was no significant difference in shell strength or calcium content of male snails between the treatments. The study suggests that P. canaliculata exhibits a sex-dependent response pattern when subjected to shell damage and calcium carbonate addition. The findings can provide some references to better understand the invasion mechanism and survival strategy of the P. canaliculata.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Excretory/secretory products (ESPs) derived from helminths have been reported to effectively control allergic inflammation, which have better therapeutic prospects than live parasite infections. However, it remains unknown whether ESPs from schistosome eggs can protect against allergies, despite reports alleging that schistosome infection could alleviate disordered allergic inflammation. METHOD: In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of ESPs from Schistosoma japonicum eggs (ESP-SJE) on asthmatic inflammation. Firstly, we successfully established an allergic airway inflammation model in mice by alum-adjuvanted ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and challenge. ESP-SJE were administered intraperitoneally on days -1 and 13 (before sensitization), on day 20 (before challenge), and on days 21-24 (challenge phase). RESULTS: The results showed that ESP-SJE treatment significantly reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils into the lung tissue, inhibited the production of the total and OVA-specific IgE during OVA-sensitized and -challenged phases, respectively, and suppressed the secretion of Th2-type inflammatory cytokines (IL-4). Additionally, ESP-SJE treatment significantly upregulated the regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the lung tissue during OVA challenge. Furthermore, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and Treg induction experiments in vitro, we might identify nine potential therapeutic proteins against allergic inflammation in ESP-SJE. The targets of these candidate proteins included glutathione S-transferase, egg protein CP422 precursor, tubulin alpha-2/alpha-4 chain, actin-2, T-complex protein 1 subunit beta, histone H₄, whey acidic protein core region, and molecular chaperone HtpG. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results discussed herein demonstrated that ESP-SJE could significantly alleviate OVA-induced asthmatic inflammation in a murine model, which might be mediated by the upregulation of Treg in lung tissues that may be induced by the potential modulatory proteins. Therefore, potential proteins in ESP-SJE might be the best candidates to be tested for therapeutic application of asthma, thus pointing out to a possible new therapy for allergic airway inflammation.",

The emergence of new genotypes of the virus and a high rate of mutation make it necessary to develop alternative treatment strategies against this deadly pathogen. Although the antiviral properties of Atropa belladonna and some of its active components, such as atropine and scopolamine, have been studied, the effect of another important component, hyoscyamine, against JEV infection has not yet been investigated. In this study, we investigated the antiviral effect of hyoscyamine against JEV and its immunomodulatory activity in embryonated chicken eggs. Pretreatment with hyoscyamine sulphate resulted in a significant decrease in the viral load in both chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and brain tissues at 48 and 96 hours postinfection. In silico studies showed stable binding and interaction between hyoscyamine and non-structural protein 5 (NS5), suggesting that this could be the basis of its antiviral effect. Embryonated eggs pretreated with hyoscyamine sulphate showed upregulation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, TLR8, interleukin 4 (IL-4), and IL-10 as well as interferons and regulatory factors. Hyoscyamine sulphate was also found to cause significant downregulation of TLR4. The potential use of hyoscyamine for controlling JEV replication and its dissemination to the brain suggest that it may be a promising therapy option against JEV in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anastatus japonicus Ashmead, a biological control agent utilized in China to control fruit bugs and forest caterpillars, is efficiently raised on large Chinese oak silkworm (Antheraea pernyi) eggs. Here, we investigated the biological parameters of non-diapaused and diapaused Anastatus japonicus after long-term storage within eggs of the host, Antheraea pernyi, under laboratory conditions. RESULTS: Diapaused mature larvae of Anastatus japonicus were more cold-tolerant than non-diapaused mature larvae, as reflected by a lower supercoiling point, lower freezing point, and higher survival rate at cold temperatures. Diapause induction enhanced the lifespan, fecundity and oviposition period of Anastatus japonicus than non-diapaused Anastatus japonicus when refrigerated for 6 months. However, after 12 months of refrigeration, the fecundity and oviposition period of Anastatus japonicus were significantly reduced with and without diapause. No difference in the progeny sex ratio of Anastatus japonicus was observed between diapause-induction treatment and those of non-diapaused. With the extension of refrigeration period from 6 months to 12 months, the lifespan, fecundity and oviposition period of Anastatus japonicus which were treated with diapause induction showed a sharp decrease. No significantly difference in the lifespan, fecundity and oviposition period of Anastatus japonicus was observed between diapause-induction treatment and those of non-diapaused when refrigerated for 12 months. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the induction of diapause is an applicable technique to achieve mass production of Anastatus japonicus in long-term storage using eggs of the factitious host Antheraea pernyi, without compromising the quality of the parasitoid. The refrigeration period of diapaused Anastatus japonicus should not exceed 6 months. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of the egg cooling profile after oviposition on blastoderm development, embryonic mortality, hatchability, and hatch time of broiler hatching eggs from young and old breeder flocks. Hatching eggs were obtained from commercial Ross 308 broiler breeders at 28 wk (young) and 64 wk (old) of age. A total of 3,150 eggs laid within a 15-min period were collected and randomly assigned to 2 temperature-controlled chambers in both flocks. The eggshell temperature (EST) was cooled to 24°C either within 6 h (control) or 45 min (rapid). After the EST reached 16°C in the chambers in all groups, eggs were transported to the commercial hatchery. Eggs were stored for 6 d at 16°C and 75% relative humidity. The development of the blastoderm in sampled eggs (25 embryos in each batch) was determined immediately after egg collection and before transport to the hatchery (after cooling) on a farm in each flock. At each flock age, there were 5 replicate trays of 150 eggs per egg cooling treatment set in a single commercial incubator. The results showed that the embryonic developmental stage was retarded by rapid cooling and by the younger flock. A flock age × cooling rate interaction was observed for fertile hatchability and early and late embryonic mortality (P < 0.001). In the young flock eggs, the fertile hatchability was significantly lower in the rapid than in the control cooling treatment (88.7 vs. 92.8%) due to higher early and late embryonic mortality, whereas rapid cooling reduced early embryonic mortality (P < 0.01) and numerically increased the fertile hatchability (88.7 vs. 87.2%) in the old flock eggs. Hatch time was affected by the cooling treatment. The average hatch time was delayed by 3 h by rapid cooling (486.2 vs. 489.2 h) after oviposition compared with the control. This study showed that cooling the EST to 24°C within 45 min (rapid cooling) compared to 6 h (control) after laying retarded the blastoderm developmental stage and hatch time of eggs from both young and old broiler breeder flocks. This was apparently detrimental for the young flock as indicated by the higher early and late embryonic mortality but beneficial for the old flock due to the lower early embryonic mortality. The differences in hatchability between young and old flock eggs resulting from a rapid cooling rate might depend on the differences in embryonic development at oviposition.",

Alytes obstetricans was used as a model for the development of assisted reproductive technologies for gamete collection, artificial fertilization and captive-rearing of embryos. Sperm collection was achieved with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), but only 17 to 50% of males responded to the hormone. In addition, an effect of captivity on sperm quality was observed. A combination of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) and hCG was tested for induction of ovulation, and 100% of females responded to the treatment. Recently collected sperm was used in artificial fertilization, and 10% of eggs showed complete embryo development. To design a method for captive-rearing of embryos, natural clutches (n = 13) were removed from males and divided into two sub-clutches. One was kept with all eggs together and in the other, the egg string was cut and eggs were split individually. All sub-clutches with eggs kept separated presented embryo survival (ranging from 27 to 61%) that hatched normally, while only one sub-clutch with embryos maintained together had some embryo survival (36%). These results may contribute to the management of this and related species."

Here, we evaluated lethal and sublethal effects of tebufenozide on C. carnea under laboratory conditions. The treatment of eggs with tebufenozide 24 or 48 h after they were laid did not affect the hatching rate or survival of the neonate larvae. Toxic effects of tebufenozide on topically treated larvae was low; development times of surviving larvae and pupae decreased significantly compared with controls. In choice bioassays, a high percentage of third-instar larvae chose prey (Spodoptera littoralis) treated with tebufenozide in preference to untreated prey. Moreover, second-instar larvae of C. carnea that had previously consumed tebufenozide-treated prey (0.75 mL/L) had significantly reduced larval development time compared with controls, while longevity of surviving adults, fecundity and egg viability were unaffected. Ingestion of tebufenozide by adults of C. carnea at the recommended field dose had no significant effect on female fecundity, egg viability or adult longevity. Tebufenozide exhibited low toxicity towards the developmental stages of C. carnea and is therefore a candidate for inclusion in IPM strategies."

Previous studies suggested that polysaccharides from eggs of Strongylocentrotus nudus (SEP) exhibited immunomodulatory activities during anti-tumor therapy, nevertheless, effects of SEP on inflammatory bowel disease and its underlying mechanisms have never been reported. In the present study, we showed that the SEP inhibited dextran sodium sulfate-induced ulcerative colitis characterized by decreased disease activity index, restored colon length and body weight, improved histopathological changes, down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines levels and Th17/Treg ratios in C57BL/6 J mice. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis suggested that SEP repaired gut barrier in UC mice, while 16S rDNA sequencing exhibited improved intestinal flora. Mechanistically, we found SEP significantly modulated autophagy-related factors in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), while might contributed to pathogenesis of UC. Furthermore, we demonstrated PI3K/Akt pathway was involved in regulatory effect of SEP on lipopolysaccharide-induced autophagy of HT-29 cells. Besides, among possible polysaccharide binding receptors, change of the CD36 expression was most significant, which was associated with PI3K/Akt signals. Collectively, our study showed for the first time that the SEP might be used a prebiotic agent to improve IBD through regulating CD36-PI3K/Akt mediated autophagy of IECs.",

In this study, we analyzed the effect of freshwater on the egg strings. A 3-h treatment with freshwater had a detrimental effect on the egg strings. First, the water penetrated the string, widening it, then entering the eggs and enlarging them. Finally, the ordered structure of the egg strings collapsed, and no alive animals hatched. Shorter treatments had a lower effectivity, and treatments with brackish water also showed milder effects. The egg strings were found to have a protective effect against low salinities, as hatched nauplii died rapidly under conditions that embryos survived. We also found that embryos react to low salinity on a molecular level by changing gene expression of several genes, when incubated in brackish water. Additionally, the hatching of embryos treated with brackish water was delayed in comparison to seawater controls.",

      "abstract": "Fasciola gigantica is one of the worldwide parasites that cause livestock and human illnesses. Chemotherapy is now the primary therapeutic option for its treatment. Drug abuse has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. As a result, there is an urgent need to discover natural and efficient anthelmintics against Fasciola spp. The study aims to evaluate the ovicidal activities of camel milk and its fractions on F. gigantica eggs. In the in vitro assay of F. gigantica eggs were submitted to different concentrations (0.5% and 1%) of camel milk fractions; Camel Milk Whey (CMW), Camel Milk Casein (CMC), and Skimmed Camel Milk (SCM) as well as a positive control (PC) of Nitroxynil (100 mg/ml) and a negative control (NC) with physiological saline. The Egg Hatching Assay (EHA) results showed that camel milk fractions exhibited ovicidal activity, especially CMW, and CMC, which showed 97.58 ± 0.58 and 96.9 ± 1.99 ovicidal activity, respectively, at a concentration of 1% after 15 days of treatment compared to PC, which exhibited 91.75 ± 4.95 ovicidal activity. The egg hatching ratios were 1.67% and 2.33% for CMW and CMC, respectively, compared to 70.17% for the NC and 6% for the PC. The LC50 values for CMW and CMC on the 15th day of treatment were 0.20 and 9.13, respectively. From the results above, we can infer that camel milk and its fractions are promising as a new alternative for fascioliasis control.",

CASE PRESENTATION: The case is of a 30-yr-old woman with no previous pregnancy, attempting an in vitro fertilization treatment for the first time. Given the extraordinary quantity of granular particles found in the perivitelline space, visible after the stripping procedure, it was not possible to establish the presence and position of the first polar body to appreciate the correct oocyte maturation (metaphase 2). Nevertheless, all the eggs were injected by the intracytoplasmic sperm injection. A time lapse incubator was used to perform the entire culture. Hence, a record of 6 days culture video was obtained. Only 2 eggs could fertilize correctly and reach the blastocyst stage on day 6. The embryos were frozen and subsequently transferred as frozen embryo transfer following the next menstrual cycle. CONCLUSION: The exceptional presence of granular particles in the perivitelline space, which reminds us for aspects and behavior of the granulosa cells, seems to affect the fertilization but not the blastocysts quality. As a matter of fact, the woman, after the embryo transfer, achieved a successful twin live birth."

In order to assess these effects, the impact of storage duration (5 days, 10 days, 15 days) and short incubation period during egg storage (SPIDES) investigated further 18, 900 eggs of broiler breeder (ROSS 308) in 3 × 2 factorial arrangement design. In the SPIDES treatment, the egg shell temperature was raised from its storage temperature (18 °C) and held at 100 °F for 3.5 h. Storage periods could significantly (P < 0.05) influence on embryo mortality (total, early, middle, and late), hatchability of both the total eggs and fertile eggs. The SPIDES treatment had a significant (P < 0.05) impact on a lower embryonic death rate and improved egg hatchability. Eggs stored for 5 days and eggs treated with SPIDES significantly (P < 0.001) shorten hatching time, batch's 90% hatching time (T 90% H), mean hatching time (MHT), maximal hatching period (MHP), and hatching window (HW). Chick quality was also determined, whereas storing eggs for 5 days and using the SPIDES treatment resulted in enhanced (P < 0.001) chick weight relative to egg weight (CW/EW), activity (AC), and chick quality score (CQS). The residual yolk sac weight (RYSW), unhealed navel (UHN %), and dirty feather (DF%) recorded the lowest (P < 0.001) values compared to long storage periods and control group. Finally, stored for 5 days treated by SPIDES positively affected the hatchability characteristics, the shortening hatching time, and the quality of chicks. Regarding the results, it was confirmed that using the SPIDES treatment to prevent the harmful effects of broiler eggs being stored for an extended period of time is a viable option.",

Their digestive characteristics in the human gastrointestinal tract and anti-cancer mechanism have not been well explained. In this study, we investigated the digestive characteristics and anti-tumor mechanisms of preserved eggs using an in vitro dynamic human gastrointestinal-IV (DHGI-IV) model. During digestion, the sample pH dynamically changed from 7.01 to 8.39. The samples were largely emptied in the stomach with a lag time of 45 min after 2 h. Protein and fat were significantly hydrolyzed with 90% and 87% digestibility, respectively. Moreover, preserved eggs digests (PED) significantly increased the free radical scavenging activity of ABTS, DPPH, FRAP and hydroxyl groups by 15, 14, 10 and 8 times more than the control group, respectively. PED significantly inhibited the growth, cloning and migration of HepG2 cells at concentrations of 250-1000 μg/mL. Meanwhile, it induced apoptosis by up/down-regulating the expression of the pro-apoptotic factor Bak and the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial pathway. PED (1000 μg/mL) treatment resulted in 55% higher ROS production than the control, which also led to apoptosis. Furthermore, PED down-regulated the expression of the pro-angiogenic genes HIF-1α and VEGF. These findings provided a reliable scientific reference for the study of the anti-tumor activity of preserved eggs."

      "abstract": "Salmonella Enteritidis is a major foodborne pathogen that causes enteric illnesses in humans, primarily through the consumption of contaminated poultry meat and eggs. Despite implementation of traditional disinfection approaches to reduce S. Enteritidis contamination, egg-borne outbreaks continue to occur, raising public health concerns and adversely affecting the popularity and profitability for the poultry industry. Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status phytochemicals such as Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TC) have previously shown to exhibit anti-Salmonella efficacy, however, the low solubility of TC is a major hurdle in its adoption as an egg wash treatment. Therefore, the present study investigated the efficacy of Trans-cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsions (TCNE) prepared with emulsifiers Tween 80 (Tw.80) or Gum Arabic and lecithin (GAL) as dip treatments, at 34°C, for reducing S. Enteritidis on shelled eggs in presence or absence of 5% chicken litter. In addition, the efficacy of TCNE dip treatments in reducing trans-shell migration of S. Enteritidis across shell barrier was investigated. The effect of wash treatments on shell color were evaluated on d 0, 1, 7, and 14 of refrigerated storage. TCNE-Tw.80 or GAL treatments (0.06, 0.12, 0.24, 0.48%) were effective in inactivating S. Enteritidis by at least 2 to 2.5 log cfu/egg as early as 1 min of washing time (P < 0.05). In presence of organic matter, nanoemulsions (0.48%) reduced S. Enteritidis counts by ∼ 2 to 2.5 log cfu/egg as early as 1 min, (P < 0.05). Nanoemulsion wash also inhibited trans-shell migration of S. Enteritidis, as compared to control (P < 0.05). The nanoemulsion wash treatments did not affect shell color (P > 0.05). Results suggest that TCNE could potentially be used as an antimicrobial wash to reduce S. Enteritidis on shelled eggs, although further studies investigating the effect of TCNE wash treatments on organoleptic properties of eggs are necessary.",

      "abstract": "One of the most effective defenses of avian hosts against obligate brood parasites is the ejection of parasitic eggs from the nests. Despite the clear fitness benefits of this behavior, individuals within so-called \"egg-rejecter\" host species still show substantial variation in their propensity to eliminate foreign eggs from the nest. We argue that this variation can be further understood by studying the physiological mechanisms of host responses to brood parasitic egg stimuli: independent lines of research increasingly support the hypothesis that stress-related physiological response to parasitic eggs may trigger egg rejection. The \"stress-mediated egg rejection\" hypothesis requires that hosts activate the stress-response when responding to parasitic egg stimuli. We tested this prediction by asking whether hosts showed differential stress response when exposed to host-like (mimetic) or parasite-like (non-mimetic) eggs. We experimentally parasitized incubating American robins Turdus migratorius, a robust egg-rejecter host to obligate brood parasitic brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater, with mimetic or non-mimetic model eggs. To assess the stress response, we measured the heart rate in incubating females immediately after experimental parasitism. We also measured plasma corticosterone and, in a subset of birds, used RNA-sequencing to analyze the expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), a precursor of adrenocorticotropic hormone, 2 h after experimental parasitism. We found that egg type had no effect on heart rate. Two hours following experimental parasitism, plasma corticosterone did not differ between the differently-colored model egg treatments or between rejecter and accepter females within the non-mimetic treatment. However, females exposed to non-mimetic eggs showed an upregulation of POMC gene expression (before FDR correction) in the pituitary compared with females treated with mimetic eggs. Our findings suggest that in an egg-rejecter host species, non-mimetic parasitic eggs may increase the activity of the stress-related hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis compared with mimetic eggs, although the temporal dynamics of this response are not yet understood."

Despite their importance, epidemiological data regarding the presence and egg-shedding intensities of these parasites are scarce. Data from 1067 horse samples collected on German horse farms initially to compare diagnostic methods were used for epidemiological analyses. Due to its higher sensitivity, presence/absence data were based on a combined sedimentation/flotation technique while faecal egg counts were based on Mini-FLOTAC. For strongyles, 46.5% of the samples were positive and the median egg-shedding intensity was 40 (range 5-2590). In multivariate analyses, prevalence and egg-shedding intensity were significantly influenced by season, age group and sample type. The drug used for the last treatment and the number of foals on the yard only affected prevalence while the number of horses on the yard and sex were only significant for egg-shedding intensity. For Parascaris spp., a prevalence of 4.6% and a median egg-shedding intensity of 0 (range 5-905) were observed. In multivariate analyses, the age group, the time since the last anthelmintic treatment, presence and number of foals had significant effects on ascarid prevalence whereas egg-shedding intensity was significantly influenced by age group and season only. Parascaris occurred only on yards with foals, but with an increasing number of foals, Parascaris egg-shedding intensity decreased. Prevalence and egg-shedding intensity were influenced by different but partially overlapping variables for Parascaris and strongyles.",

One of the most important environmental stressors that hinder quail productivity is heat stress. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of spraying Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) eggs with betaine after exposure to short-term high temperature during early embryogenesis on pre and post-hatch performance of quail. A total of 750 eggs were equally divided into two groups. Eggs in the first group were incubated at normal incubation temperature (37.5 °C/NIT), while those in the second group were incubated at high incubation temperature (39.0 °C/HIT) for 3 h daily from day 4-6 of incubation. Eggs in both groups were subjected to five treatments, NC (negative control), PC sprayed distilled water (positive control), while B0.5, B1, and B2 treatments were sprayed with distilled water supplemented with 500, 1000, and 2000 mg betaine/L, respectively. The chick weight at hatch, slaughter weight, and first egg weight was significantly impaired by the HIT treatment. The HIT group revealed a significant increase in cloacal temperature, H/L ratio, liver enzymes, triglyceride, and cholesterol and a significant decrease in hatchability, T3 hormone, and blood protein levels than the NIT group. Regarding betaine effects, the embryonic mortality rates, hatchability, hatched chick weight, and oviduct percentage in groups treated with 1000 or 2000 mg betaine/L were significantly improved compared with the control. Also, spraying betaine at 1000 or 2000 mg/L significantly increased blood protein and triiodothyronine (T3) hormone levels and significantly decrease liver enzyme levels and total feed consumption compared with the untreated group. The right/total ventricle ratio (RV/TV) of quail in HIT group was significantly increased, while betaine treatment significantly decreased this ratio. Considering these results, it is strongly suggested that spraying of betaine on eggs at 2000 mg/L optimizes Japanese quail performance.",

Most egg-associated illness has been attributed to Salmonella serovar Enteritidis, but a few other serovars (notably S. Heidelberg and S. Typhimurium) are also sometimes implicated. The edible interior contents of eggs typically become contaminated with S. Enteritidis because the pathogen's unique virulence attributes enable it to colonize reproductive tissues in systemically infected laying hens. Other serovars are more commonly associated with surface contamination of eggshells. Both research and field experience have demonstrated that the most effective overall Salmonella control strategy in commercial laying flocks is the application of multiple interventions throughout the egg production cycle. At the preharvest (egg production) level, intervention options of demonstrated efficacy include vaccination and gastrointestinal colonization control via treatments such as prebiotics, probiotics, and bacteriophages, Effective environmental management of housing systems used for commercial laying flocks is also essential for minimizing opportunities for the introduction, transmission, and persistence of Salmonella in laying flocks. At the postharvest (egg processing and handling) level, careful regulation of egg storage temperatures is critical for limiting Salmonella multiplication inside the interior contents.",

      "abstract": "Presently, there is a dearth of proteomic data for parasitic mites and their relationship with the host animals. Here, using a high throughput LC-MS/MS-based approach, we undertook the first comprehensive, large-scale proteomic investigation of egg and adult female stages of the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei-one of the most important parasitic mites of humans and other animals worldwide. In total, 1,761 S. scabiei proteins were identified and quantified with high confidence. Bioinformatic analyses revealed differentially expressed proteins to be involved predominantly in biological pathways or processes including genetic information processing, energy (oxidative phosphorylation), nucleotide, amino acid, carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism, and some adaptive processes. Selected, constitutively and highly expressed proteins, such as peptidases, scabies mite inactivated protease paralogues (SMIPPs) and muscle proteins (myosin and troponin), are proposed to be involved in key biological processes within S. scabiei, host-parasite interactions and/or the pathogenesis of scabies. These proteomic data will enable future molecular, biochemical and physiological investigations of early developmental stages of S. scabiei and the discovery of novel interventions, targeting the egg stage, given its non-susceptibility to acaricides currently approved for the treatment of scabies in humans.",

      "abstract": "Eggs are highly nutritious foods, yet intake by children in Ethiopia is low. We hypothesized that a nutrition-sensitive poultry intervention improves nutritional status of children 6-18 months using a 6-month cluster randomized controlled community trial. Intervention group (IG) children received a gift of two egg-laying hens in a ceremony where children's ownership of the chickens was declared by community leaders. Parents promised to add more hens and feed the owner-child one-egg-a-day. Trained community workers reinforced egg feeding, environmental sanitation and poultry husbandry. Control group (CG) mothers received usual nutrition education on child feeding. At baseline 29.6% of children were stunted, 19.4% underweight and 8.6% wasted. Egg consumption significantly increased only in IG, at 6 months. The intervention increased weight-for-age and weight-for-height z-scores by 0.38 (95% CI = 0.13-0.63) and 0.43 (95% CI = 0.21-0.64), respectively. Binary logit model indicated IG children were 54% (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.26-0.84) and 42% (OR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.37-0.91) less likely to be underweight and stunted, respectively, compared to CG. IG children attained the milestone of running (p = 0.022; AHR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.05-1.95), kicking a ball (p = 0.027; AHR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.04-1.87) and throwing a ball (p = 0.045; AHR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.01-1.86) earlier than CG. This nutrition-sensitive child-owned poultry approach should be implemented where animal-source food intake is low.",

Upon critically examining the ethical dimensions of various possible IVG applications in human fertility treatment from a Sunni Islamic perspective, together with benefit-harm (maslahah-mafsadah) assessment; it is concluded that utilization of IVG, once its efficacy and safety are guaranteed, could be permissible by strictly adhering to Islamic ethical principles related to marriage, biological/genetic relatedness, sexual intercourse, and moral status of the embryo/fetus versus that of the gamete. As a result, IVG will be acceptable for treating primary infertility, age-related infertility, and preventing genetic diseases.

The intervention arm received emotionally compelling radio and television advertisements about eggs, and was exposed to promotional activities and advertising about eggs at points of purchase, schools and health facilities; the comparison arm received no intervention. Children 6-59 months of age (intervention: n = 1359; comparison: n = 1485) were assessed 14 months apart. Intent-to-treat analyses with analysis of covariance method assessed the impact of the intervention on caregivers' behaviour towards eggs, caregivers' willingness to pay for eggs, availability of eggs in households, and consumption of eggs by children 6-59 months of age. Analyses were adjusted for possible confounders and perceived effects of COVID-19 on finances and food consumption. Compared to the comparison arm, the intervention arm showed a greater prevalence of household egg acquisition (odds ratio = 1.34, p < 0.0001), and larger improvements in caregiver self-efficacy (β = 0.242, p = 0.004) and intent to feed eggs to children (β = 0.080, p = 0.021). No effects were found on children's egg consumption or caregivers' reported willingness to pay for eggs. The lack of impact on child egg consumption despite increased acquisition of eggs and caregiver self-efficacy suggests that other barriers to child consumption may exist. Additional research should further investigate factors that may influence intrahousehold distribution of eggs and whether these may also influence other nutritious foods.",

The bacterial mass spectra were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis. Bacterial isolation was performed for 55 isolates belonging to 12 genera from two major nesting sites. In Sugözü Beaches 62.2% of the bacteria species belonged to Enterobacteriaceae and in Göksu Delta 44.4% of the bacteria species belonged to Morganellaceae. Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus haemolyticus had not previously been detected in any sea turtle nests.

They can enter a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state in response to harsh stress. VBNC cells still retain membrane integrity and metabolic activity, which may pose health risks. However, the formation mechanism and resuscitation ability of VBNC cells are not well understood. In this work, Salmonella spp. cocktails, including Salmonella enterica serovar Newport and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, in liquid egg products was induced into a VBNC state by mild heat treatment, a commonly used method to inhibit the growth of pathogenic in liquid egg industry. Mild heat induced VBNC cells were found to resuscitate in liquid egg yolk (LEY) and liquid whole egg (LWE), but they failed to recover in liquid egg white (LEW). In addition, a certain number of cells remained as VBNC state after in vitro digestion. The membrane vesicle (MV) protein encoding gene pagC, two-component system encoding genes phoP/Q and sigma factor encoding gene rpoS were highly expressed in VBNC cells compared with the culturable counterparts. The results of this study can contribute to a better understanding of the health risks associated with Salmonella spp. in VBNC state and provide a theoretical basis for formation mechanism of VBNC state.",

Here, we report the performance of the innovative (semi-)automated Schistoscope 5.0 for optical digital detection and quantification of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine, using conventional microscopy as the reference standard. At baseline, 487 participants in a rural setting in Nigeria were assessed, of which 166 (34.1%) tested S. haematobium positive by conventional microscopy. Captured images from the Schistoscope 5.0 were analyzed manually (semiautomation) and by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm (full automation). Semi- and fully automated digital microscopy showed comparable sensitivities of 80.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.2-86.0) and 87.3% (95% CI: 81.3-92.0), but a significant difference in specificity of 95.3% (95% CI: 92.4-97.4) and 48.9% (95% CI: 43.3-55.0), respectively. Overall, estimated egg counts of semi- and fully automated digital microscopy correlated significantly with the egg counts of conventional microscopy (r = 0.90 and r = 0.80, respectively, P < 0.001), although the fully automated procedure generally underestimated the higher egg counts. In 38 egg positive cases, an additional urine sample was examined 10 days after praziquantel treatment, showing a similar cure rate and egg reduction rate when comparing conventional microscopy with semiautomated digital microscopy. In this first extensive field evaluation, we found the semiautomated Schistoscope 5.0 to be a promising tool for the detection and monitoring of S. haematobium infection, although further improvement of the AI algorithm for full automation is required.",

METHODS: We used a phototherapy device with light-emitting diode (670 nm wavelength) as the source of photobiomodulation. We applied the red light at a distance of 2.5 cm to the surface of the chorioallantoic embryonic membrane of chicken eggs in 2, 4, or 8 sessions for 90 s and analyzed the vascular network architecture using AngioTool software (National Cancer Institute, USA). We treated the negative control group with 50 μl phosphate-buffered-saline (pH 7.4) and the positive control group (Beva) with 50 μl bevacizumab solution (Avastin, Produtos Roche Químicos e Farmacêuticos, S.A., Brazil). RESULTS: We found a decrease in total vessel length in the Beva group (24.96% ± 12.85%) and in all the groups that received 670 nm red light therapy (2× group, 34.66% ± 8.66%; 4× group, 42.42% ± 5.26%; 8× group, 38.48% ± 6.96%), compared with the negative control group. The fluence of 5.4 J/cm2 in 4 sessions (4×) showed more regular vessels. The number of junctions in the groups that received a higher incidence of 670 nm red light (4× and 8×) significantly decreased (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Photo-biomodulation helps reduce vascularization in chorioallantoic embryonic membrane of chicken eggs and changes in the network architecture. Our results open the possibility of future clinical studies on using this therapy in patients with retinal diseases with neovascular components, especially age-related macular degeneration.",

      "abstract": "Biofilms serve to house diverse microbial communities, which are responsible for the majority of wastewater constituent degradation and transformation in treatment wetlands (TWs). TW biofilm has been generally conceptualized as a relatively uniform film covering available surfaces. However, no studies attaining direct visual 3D representations of biofilm morphology have been conducted. This study focuses on imaging the morphology of detached, gravel-associated, and rhizospheric (Phalaris arundinacea) biofilms from subsurface TW mesocosms. Images obtained through both traditional light microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy (E-SEM) and Wet-SEM revealed that TW biofilms are structurally heterogeneous ranging from corrugated films to clusters of aggregates. Features such as water channels and pores were observed suggesting that pollutant transport inside biofilms is complex, and that the interfacial surface area between water and biofilm is much larger than previously understood. Biofilm thickness generally ranged between 170 and 240 μm, with internal biofilm porosities estimated as 34 ± 10 %, reaching a maximum of 50 %. Internal biofilm matrix pore diameters ranged from 1 to 205.2 μm, with a distribution that favored pores and channels smaller than 10 μm, and a mean equivalent spherical diameter of 8.6 μm. Based on the large variation in pore and channel sizes it is expected that a variety of flow regimes and therefore pollutant dynamics are likely to occur inside TW biofilm matrices. Based on the visual evidence and analysis, a new conceptual model was created to reflect the microscale TW biofilm dynamics and morphology. This new conceptual model will serve to inform future biokinetic modelling, microscale hydrology, microbial community assessment, and pollutant treatment studies.",

Most indications for treatment when using donated eggs are caused by an age-related decrease in reproductive capacity. We evaluated the emotional state regarding accepting egg donation in participants who chose this option for in vitro fertilization cycles. This is a retrospective, Brazilian cohort study, based on data collected from sixty psychological counseling sessions with participants that opted to be enrolled in an egg donation program. A single professional conducted semi-structured psychological counselling sessions. The data were analyzed using a thematic analysis as the qualitative methodology. Two years after the psychological counseling sessions, participants were contacted to obtain information about their outcomes. Of 60 sessions, 19 (32%) were classified as involving participants with positive emotional state (group 1), 14 (23%) with unfavorable emotional state (group 2), and 27 (45%) without evident classification (group 3). Three couples did not undergo treatment until two years after the psychological counselling session and the other couples underwent treatment in a period ranging from 1-8 months after the session. This is the first study in the Brazilian population regarding the acceptance of egg donation. The process of acceptance of infertility and the impossibility to have a biological child is fundamental to gradually accepting a new way of becoming a parent. Psychological counseling can contribute to reflecting on the use of donated eggs, exploring its emotional implications and identifying the need for psychotherapeutic work to address conflict and suffering.",

Fertilized eggs of red tilapia exposed to different concentrations of CoQ10 were hatched at rates (p > 0.05) between 38 to 54.67%. The yolk-sac diameter at the 2nd day post hatching (dph), ranged from 1.85 to 1.87 mm in depth and 1.63 to 1.88 mm in width and was not altered by the CoQ10 treatments. Similarly, red tilapia survival (p > 0.05) ranged from 22.67 to 32%. On 6 dph, a slight percentage (2.08%) of survived fishes exposed to high CoQ10 dose (C10) exhibited larval deformation in the form of an axial curvature of the spine in the abdominal and caudal region. Larvae displayed a normal structure of the esophagus folds in all fish groups, and larvae in the C5 group displayed the longest folds and widest muscularis layer, followed by fishes in the C10 group and the control. Red tilapia fry on 30 dph treated with CoQ10 possessed higher antioxidant potentials in terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) compared to the control. In conclusion, treating Red tilapia fertile eggs with 5 mg/L CoQ10 improves the growth, gut structure, and antioxidant efficiency of the produced larvae."

      "abstract": "Ascaridia galli infection models use eggs isolated from chicken excreta, worm uteri and worms cultured in artificial media. The aim of this study was to compare the infectivity of A. galli eggs isolated from these sources under two infection regimens. A 3 × 2 factorial arrangement was employed to test the infectivity of A. galli eggs from the three sources and two modes of infection (single or trickle infection). One hundred and fifty-six Isa-Brown one day-old cockerels randomly assigned to the six treatment groups (n = 26) were orally infected with embryonated A. galli eggs obtained from the three A. galli egg sources (worm uteri, excreta or eggs shed in vitro) administered either as single dose of 300 eggs at one day-old or trickle infected with 3 doses of 100 eggs over the first week of life. Twenty-two negative control birds remained uninfected. Eggs obtained from cultured worms or excreta exhibited a higher embryonation capacity (P = 0.003) than eggs obtained from worm uteri. There were higher worm establishment (infectivity) rates from embryonated eggs originating from cultured worms and worm uteri compared with eggs obtained from fresh excreta (P < 0.0001). Trickle infection resulted in a significantly higher total worm burden (P = 0.002), establishment rate (P = 0.002) and excreta egg counts (EEC, P = 0.025) than single infection. Worm length was greater in birds infected with embryonated eggs from excreta than from uteri or cultured worms (P < 0.0001). However, mode of infection did not affect worm length (P = 0.719) and weight (P = 0.945). A strong significant positive linear correlation was observed between EECs and female worm counts at 12 weeks of post infection sampling (r = 0.75; P < 0.0001). Body weight of birds was negatively correlated with both worm burden (r = - 0.21; P < 0.01) and EEC (r = - 0.20; P < 0.05) at 12 weeks post infection. In conclusion, our results show that eggs shed by cultured worms or isolated from worm uteri had greater infective capacity than eggs harvested from excreta and that trickle rather than bolus infection resulted in higher worm establishment. These factors should be taken into account when considering artificial infection protocols for A. galli.",

      "abstract": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an appropriate model for the study of the immunologic and pathologic mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS). According to the hygiene hypothesis, helminths can improve immunoregulation and have therapeutic effects on immune-mediated diseases. In this study, we used Dicrocoelium dendriticum (Dicrocoeliidae, Platyhelminthes) eggs for the evaluation of their prophylactic and treatment effects on EAE disease. D. dendriticum eggs were extracted. Female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with the specific antigen MOG35-55 , and then the egg extracts were utilized for prophylaxis and/or treatment. Clinical symptoms and other relevant parameters were assessed daily. The mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17 were assessed with a real-time polymerase chain reaction technique. Furthermore, secretion of TGF-β and IL-17 cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data indicated that clinical symptoms in prophylaxis and treatment groups were decreased significantly in comparison with the untreated control group (p < .001). Our results showed a significant decrease in IL-17, as well as an increase in TGF-β cytokine in the treatment group compared to the EAE control group (p < .01). Furthermore, in the prophylaxis and treatment groups, the mRNA expression of disease-associated cytokines decreased and the mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines increased. In this study, the D. dendriticum egg ameliorates the clinical symptoms of the EAE model through the modulation of related cytokines of Th17 and Treg cells. Therefore, using this parasite egg could be a new treatment for MS.",
