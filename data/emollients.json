      "abstract": "Xerosis cutis (dry skin) is a common and burdensome symptom of atopic dermatitis (AD). Topical emollients restore skin hydration and barrier function through the physicochemical properties of their nonactive constituents (e.g., glycerol, urea, lactic acid, liquid paraffin, petrolatum) and represent the mainstay of basic therapy for xerosis cutis associated with AD. Newer \"emollients plus\" containing active ingredients may expand the treatment options available to patients with AD; however, we believe that basic emollients remain an important strategy for the long-term management of xerosis cutis. To that end, this article aims to review the clinical value of basic emollients for treating xerosis cutis in AD. We performed a series of literature searches to identify clinical studies of basic emollients containing one or more of the following ingredients: almond and coconut oils, amino acids, chondroitin, dexpanthenol, glucose, glycerol, glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid, lactic acid, lanolin, olive oil, paraffin, petrolatum, phospholipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, pyroglutamic acid, squalene, triglycerides, urea, vegetable oils, and vitamin E. From these searches, the authors identified articles of interest that described the efficacy of basic emollients for the treatment of xerosis cutis associated with AD. Studies included in our review varied widely in terms of sample size, study design, interventions, and endpoints but collectively showed that most basic emollient formulations are safe and effective at improving objective and subjective measures of xerosis cutis. These studies also demonstrated the importance of ongoing emollient therapy to avoid xerosis relapse and the additive benefits of emollients that combine ingredients with complementary biophysical properties (e.g., glycerol with its humectant effect plus petrolatum with its occludent effect). Overall, the current body of literature reinforces the role of basic emollients as effective and accessible treatment options for the long-term management of xerosis cutis in patients with AD."

      "abstract": "Healthy skin is structured to maintain water balance by maximizing water retention and minimizing evaporative loss. The water-holding and barrier functions of the skin can be impaired by several factors that lead to xerosis cutis (dry skin); however, they can also be restored by basic emollients that act through the physicochemical properties of their constituents. This article aims to give a narrative review of the physiology of normal skin hydration, the key pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in dry skin, and the functional effects of basic emollients for managing xerosis cutis. Skin hydration is primarily mediated by the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the epidermis. Hygroscopic compounds in the SC maintain the skin's water-binding capacity, while the intercellular lipid bilayer and outer hydrolipid film prevent evaporative water loss. Xerosis cutis is characterized by a reduction in natural moisturizing factors or hydrolipids in the SC; it may be caused by exogenous triggers (e.g., cold weather, lifestyle, pollution), endogenous factors (e.g., aging, medication use) or genetic predisposition (as seen in atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, ichthyosis), or it may present as a symptom of a systemic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism). Regardless of the underlying cause, basic emollients are recommended for the treatment of xerosis cutis and are typically formulated with humectants to improve skin hydration and water-holding capacity (e.g., glycerol, urea, lactic acid) and occludents to restore the epidermal barrier (e.g., petrolatum, liquid paraffin). Basic emollients remain the standard of care for the long-term management of xerosis cutis and diseases associated with dry skin."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pollen sensitization may be directed towards proteins also found in plant foods. OBJECTIVE: We explored whether early food introduction and skin emollients prevented birch and grass sensitization at 3 years of age, and whether the effect was mediated by skin barrier function or modified by season of birth. METHODS: In the population-based randomized controlled PreventADALL trial, information on allergic sensitization by 3 years was available in 2066 children. Newborns were randomized (1:1:1:1) to no (controls), food (tastes of peanut, cow's milk, wheat and egg, from 3 months), skin (oil baths and facial cream from 2 weeks), or both interventions. Sensitization was defined as specific Immunoglobulin E ≥0.1 kUA/L and/or skin prick test wheal ≥3 mm. A mediator analysis assessed the skin intervention's effect through transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at 3 months. An interaction analysis estimated effect modification by month of birth. RESULTS: At 3 years, 117/1492 (7.8%) were sensitized to birch and 40/1482 (2.7%) to timothy. Compared to controls, crude OR (95% CI) in the food, skin and combined intervention groups, respectively, was 1.10 (0.63-1.93), 2.38 (1.43-3.95) and 0.70 (0.37-1.34) for birch, and 0.58 (0.21-1.60), 1.73 (0.77-3.91) and 1.00 (0.40-2.49) for grass sensitization. A significant indirect effect of the skin intervention through TEWL was observed, but no significant modification by month of birth for either intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Early food introduction did not affect the risk of pollen sensitization. Infants with skin intervention only had increased risk of birch sensitization, mediated by reduced skin barrier function in early infancy."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, pruritic skin disease with complex pathogenesis, which affects about 43 million children aged 1-4 years. One of the most known methods of alleviating symptoms of AD is emollient treatment, which varies depending on formulation and additional active ingredients. There is some evidence that emollients could be used in AD prevention in high-risk children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the literature from Cochrane Library, PubMed and Medline was conducted between August and September 2023 with the following keywords: \"atopic dermatitis\", \"emollients\", and \"prevention\". Only randomised clinical trials published in the last 5 years were included into the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Considering the inclusion criteria only 11 randomized clinical trials were taken into account, and six of them proved lack of effect of emollients in the prevention of atopic dermatitis among neonates from AD risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Emollient treatment has a good safety profile and most of the ingredients used in formulations are nonirritant for sensitive newborn and infant skin. There is some evidence of the positive effects of emollient treatment in prevention of AD in predisposed populations. The relatively high cost of emollient treatment (vs regular infant skin-care routine) would support the necessity for further evaluation of their effectiveness in nonpredisposed populations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The main determinant of emollient effectiveness is whether it is used, which in turn is linked with user satisfaction. OBJECTIVES: To compare parental satisfaction with emollient type for the treatment of childhood eczema. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the Best Emollients for Eczema (BEE) trial was undertaken. In total, 550 children aged between 6 months and 12 years were recruited from primary care in England and randomized to use a lotion, cream, gel or ointment as their main emollient for 16 weeks. At week, 16 parents were asked to complete an Emollient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ESQ). Completion rates and scores were compared, using χ2 test, t-test calculations and one-way Anova as appropriate. RESULTS: Data on 378 participants (68.7% of those randomized) were analysed. Mean ESQ scores were gel 20.9 (SD 5.3), lotion 20.4 (SD 5.6), cream 18.8 (SD 6.3) and ointment 15.2 (SD 6.8) (P < 0.001). In pairwise comparisons, there was a statistically significant difference in mean ESQ scores between ointment and lotion (P < 0.001), ointment and cream (P < 0.001) and ointment and gel (P < 0.001) but not between lotion, cream and gel. Participants using lotions had highest overall satisfaction and were most likely to continue using their emollient. ESQ scores were correlated with reported emollient use and improvements in parent-reported eczema severity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, lotions and gels were favoured over creams and ointments. Although satisfaction is determined by personal preference, these results will aid parents, clinicians and children to find the right emollient(s) for them.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of niacinamide-containing body emollients combined with a cleansing gel on the clinical symptoms of mild atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults. METHODS: From July 2022 to January 2023, adults with mild AD were enrolled at Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University using single-center, randomized and placebo-controlled methods. They were divided into three groups: the control group, treatment group 1 (T1) receiving niacinamide-containing body emollients alone, and treatment group 2 (T2) receiving emollients plus niacinamide-containing cleansing gel. All patients were orally administered 10 mg of ebastine tablets daily. AD severity (SCORAD score), peak pruritus numeric rating scale (PP-NRS), patient-oriented measure of eczema (POEM), dermatological quality of life index (DLQI) score, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and stratum corneum water content (SCWC) were measured by the same dermatologist at days 0, 7, 14, and 28. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients were enrolled, including 38 in the control group, 42 in the T1 group and 42 in the T2 group. There were no obvious adverse reactions at the end of the study and the clinical scores and stratum corneum barrier of all the groups improved significantly relative to baseline. The SCORAD, PP-NRS, DLQI, TEWL and SCWC scores in T1 group (12.43 ± 3, 3.3 ± 0.9, 7.1 ± 2.33, 17.1 ± 9.12, 67.2 ± 21.46, seperately) and T2 group (11.17 ± 3.26, 3 ± 1.3, 6.5 ± 2.11, 16.3 ± 9.12, 69.4 ± 24.52, seperately) were significantly improved than the control group(15.1 ± 3.64, 4.3 ± 1.7, 9.5 ± 2.46, 21.2 ± 9.47, 52.7 ± 22.43, seperately) at the endpoint of the study, while compared the POEM scores, only T2 group showed the difference with control group (5.2 ± 1.4 vs. 6 ± 1.6). The epidermal barrier parameters of TEWL and SCWC in the T2 group (17.57 ± 5.24, 66.46 ± 21.38, seperately) were significantly better than that of the T1 (19.96 ± 4.45, 56.45 ± 20.48, seperately) and control group(21.89 ± 7.03, 51.56 ± 16.58, seperately) on the 14th day of follow-up. CONCLUSION: The use of niacinamide-containing body emollients can significantly improve the clinical symptoms, quality of life, and skin barrier function in patients with mild AD. The addition of niacinamide-containing cleansing gel can also affect the clinical efficacy at certain time points.",

      "abstract": "Significance: Pressure injuries are prevalent, yet preventable global health care problem estimated to affect 14% of hospital patients and up to 46% of aged care residents. One common prevention strategy is improving skin integrity through emollient therapy to optimize hydration and avoid skin breakdown. Therefore, this study aimed to review the literature and determine effectiveness of inert emollients, moisturizers, and barrier preparations compared with standard care, to prevent pressure injury in aged care or hospital settings. Recent Advances: Search terms were derived with database searches, including ProQuest, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, and the Cochrane library. The Robins1 and Risk of Bias 2 (Rob2) quality appraisal tools were used. A meta-analysis of the effects of interventions was conducted (random effects). Four studies met the inclusion criteria, with heterogeneous quality. Pooling of nonrandomized studies found that the application of emollients, moisturizers or barrier preparations did not significantly reduce incidence of pressure injury compared with standard care (relative risk 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.15-1.63, Z = 1.15, p = 0.25). Critical Issues: This review suggests that the use of inert moisturizers, emollients, or barrier preparations for preventing pressure injuries was not effective to prevent pressure injury in aged care or hospital settings. However, there was a distinct lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with only one meeting the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, most of the included studies did not report on the frequency of application of the product, making it difficult to determine if application was in line with current international guidelines. One included study, which utilized a combination of neutral body wash and emollient demonstrated a significant reduction in the development of stage one and two pressure injuries. This combination of care may further support skin integrity and should be further examined in future trials. Future Directions: Future studies should ideally be RCTs, which control for skin cleansing, and implement an inert moisturizer emollient or barrier preparation as part of a pressure injury reduction bundle of care. Standardization of the application of the product, the volume of product applied at each application, and the quality of the product should also be considered."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emollients are universally recommended for atopic dermatitis/eczema ('eczema'), to improve the skin barrier and reduce symptoms. However, our knowledge of the frequency and nature of adverse effects associated with their use is limited. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine how well adverse events are reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of emollients for eczema. METHODS: MEDLINE was searched from inception (1946) to May 2022. Inclusion criteria were RCTs of moisturizers or emollients used as a leave-on treatment (as the intervention or control) in adults or children with eczema. Exclusion criteria were non-RCTs; patients with other diagnoses included; use of emollient as bath additives, soap substitutes or as preventative; and not published in English. References of eligible papers were reviewed for any additional, relevant research. Data were extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and analysed descriptively. An assessment of study quality was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for RCTs. RESULTS: From 369 potential papers, 35 papers (reporting on 34 studies) were included. Most research was conducted in research centres or hospitals (unclear in 34%). In total, 89% reported collecting data on adverse events related to emollient treatment use but the methods used were poorly reported (40% unclear). Four papers used patient questionnaires/diaries. However, it was unclear how and what was collected as only two studies showed the questionnaires used. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of adverse events related to emollient use in trials of patients with eczema is poor and inconsistent. Agreement should be reached on how and what adverse events should be collected, to standardize reporting across studies.",

A novel generation of emollients, 'emollients plus', containing active, non-medicated substances, has softened the distinction between emollients and topical drugs. A literature search for selected key words was performed using PubMed. Additional papers were identified based on author expertise. Whilst the inclusion of five components of an ideal emollient has been proposed, no such consensus exists for emollients plus and they can vary markedly in their composition and modes of action for AD treatment. This could have a profound effect on their clinical efficacy. The efficacy of emollients plus in restoring and maintaining skin barrier function has been demonstrated on multiple levels, with evidence reported for their effects on the physical and biochemical, microbial, immunological, and neurosensory barriers. When selecting an appropriate AD treatment approach, the safety profiles of the available topical therapies must be carefully considered. There are several proposed treatment approaches for AD, including preventive, proactive, intermittent, and synergistic approaches. Emollients plus may be effective not only as maintenance therapy for AD, but also when used synergistically with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Latin American patients in the United States experience significant health disparities. Community health workers (promotoras de salud) reduce disparities by providing culturally appropriate education. While educational interventions have been studied in atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic dermatologic condition affecting children, none have evaluated the use of promotoras in Spanish-speaking pediatric patients in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To create and evaluate a promotora-led education program for Spanish-speaking caregivers of Latin American, pediatric patients with AD through a randomized, controlled, evaluator-blinded study. METHODS: Children with moderate/severe AD (n = 48) were recruited from the pediatric dermatology clinic at Children's Health℠ in Dallas, TX and randomized to receive clinic education (n = 26) or clinic education plus promotora home visits (n = 22). The primary outcome was overall adherence to topical emollients over the 12-week study, quantified by MEMSCap™ devices; several secondary endpoints were evaluated. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a trend toward increased overall adherence to emollients over the 12-week study period in promotora (median [interquartile range, IQR]: 43% [26%-61%]) versus non-promotora (median [IQR]: 20% [11%-49%]) (p = .09) groups. SCORAD, AD knowledge, and Spanish-language Parental Quality of Life Questionnaire for AD (Sp-PIQoL-AD) improved in both groups, although there was no statistically significant difference between groups. There was a trend toward increased AD knowledge at Week 4 (p = .06) in the promotora group. CONCLUSIONS: A promotora-led educational intervention is a promising approach in increasing caregiver medication adherence in pediatric, Latin American patients with AD in the United States. Further research using creative and culturally appropriate strategies to increase medication adherence is necessary to reduce health disparities in other racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Primary prevention of food allergy by early introduction of allergenic foods seems promising. We aimed to determine whether early food introduction or the application of regular skin emollients in infants from a general population reduced the risk of food allergy. METHODS: This 2 × 2 factorial, cluster-randomised trial was done at Oslo University Hospital and Østfold Hospital Trust, Oslo, Norway, and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Infants of women recruited antenatally at the routine 18-week ultrasound examination were cluster-randomised at birth to the following groups: (1) no intervention group; (2) the skin intervention group (skin emollients; bath additives and facial cream; from age 2 weeks to <9 months, both at least four times per week); (3) the food intervention group (early complementary feeding of peanut, cow's milk, wheat, and egg from age 3 months); or (4) combined intervention group (skin and food interventions). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) using computer-generated randomisation based on clusters of 92 geographical areas and eight 3-month time blocks. Study personnel performing clinical assessments were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was allergy to any interventional food at 36 months of age. The primary efficacy analysis was done by intention-to-treat analysis, which included all participants who were randomly assigned, apart from three individuals who withdrew their consent. This was a study performed within ORAACLE (the Oslo Research Group of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood; the Lung and Environment). This study is registered as ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02449850. FINDINGS: We recruited 2697 women with 2701 pregnancies, from whom 2397 newborn infants were enrolled between April 14, 2015, and April 11, 2017. Of these infants, 597 were randomly assigned to the no intervention group, 575 to the skin intervention group, 642 to the food intervention group, and 583 to the combined intervention group. One participant in each of the no intervention, food intervention, and skin intervention groups withdrew consent and were therefore not included in any analyses. Food allergy was diagnosed in 44 children; 14 (2·3%) of 596 infants in the non-intervention group, 17 (3·0%) of 574 infants in the skin intervention group, six (0·9%) of 641 infants in the food intervention group, and seven (1·2%) of 583 infants in the combined intervention group. Peanut allergy was diagnosed in 32 children, egg allergy in 12 children, and milk allergy in four children. None had allergy to wheat. Prevalence of food allergy was reduced in the food intervention group compared with the no food intervention group (risk difference -1·6% [95% CI -2·7 to -0·5]; odds ratio [OR] 0·4 [95% CI 0·2 to 0·8]), but not compared with the skin intervention group (0·4% [95% CI -0·6 to 1· 5%]; OR 1·3 [0·7 to 2·3]), with no significant interaction effect (p=1·0). Preventing food allergy in one child required early exposure to allergenic foods in 63 children. No serious adverse events were observed. INTERPRETATION: Exposure to allergenic foods from 3 months of age reduced food allergy at 36 months in a general population. Our results support that early introduction of common allergenic foods is a safe and effective strategy to prevent food allergy.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there are no trials comparing emollients commonly used for childhood eczema. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of the four main emollient types: lotions, creams, gels, and ointments. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, individually randomised, parallel group, phase 4 superiority trial in 77 general practice surgeries in England. Children aged between 6 months and 12 years with eczema (Patient Orientated Eczema Measure [POEM] score >2) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1; stratified by centre and minimised by baseline POEM score and age, using a web-based system) to lotions, creams, gels, or ointments. Clinicians and parents were unmasked. The initial emollient prescription was for 500 g or 500 mL, to be applied twice daily and as required. Subsequent prescriptions were determined by the family. The primary outcome was parent-reported eczema severity over 16 weeks (weekly POEM), with analysis as randomly assigned regardless of adherence, adjusting for baseline and stratification variables. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants. This trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN84540529. FINDINGS: Between Jan 19, 2018, and Oct 31, 2019, 12 417 children were assessed for eligibility, 550 of whom were randomly assigned to a treatment group (137 to lotion, 140 to cream, 135 to gel, and 138 to ointment). The numbers of participants who contributed at least two POEM scores and were included in the primary analysis were 131 in the lotion group, 137 in the cream group, 130 in the gel group, and 126 in the ointment group. Baseline median age was 4 years (IQR 2-8); 255 (46%) participants were girls, 295 (54%) were boys; 473 (86%) participants were White; and the mean POEM score was 9·3 (SD 5·5). There was no difference in eczema severity between emollient types over 16 weeks (global p value=0·77), with adjusted POEM pairwise differences of: cream versus lotion 0·42 (95% CI -0·48 to 1·32), gel versus lotion 0·17 (-0·75 to 1·09), ointment versus lotion -0·01 (-0·93 to 0·91), gel versus cream -0·25 (-1·15 to 0·65), ointment versus cream -0·43 (-1·34 to 0·48), and ointment versus gel -0·18 (-1·11 to 0·75). This result remained unchanged following multiple imputation, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses. The total number of adverse events did not significantly differ between the treatment groups (lotions 49 [36%], creams 54 [39%], gels 54 [40%], and ointments 48 [35%]; p=0·79), although stinging was less common with ointments (12 [9%] of 138 participants) than lotions (28 [20%] of 137), creams (24 [17%] of 140), or gels (25 [19%] of 135). INTERPRETATION: We found no difference in effectiveness between the four main types of emollients for childhood eczema. Users need to be able to choose from a range of emollients to find one that they are more likely to use effectively. FUNDING: National Institute for Health and Care Research.",

Moisturizing is an integral part of treatment for AD, but its potential for prevention of AD is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the early use of emollients in infancy can prevent later development of AD. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library and other databases to collect randomized controlled trials on early use of emollients in infants for a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine articles were included. The OR value for incidence rate was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.48-1.01). No significant publication bias was found by Egger's test. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the final conclusion was reliable. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the difference in incidence rate of AD between the experimental and control groups was not statistically significant. However, due to different methods of using emollients, different follow-up times and different sample sizes included in this meta-analysis, a definitive conclusion could not be reached in this study. In the future, it is still necessary to carry out randomized controlled, multicenter, large-sample trials with an excellent study design and high methodological quality on early application of emollients in high-risk infants to prevent AD.",

      "abstract": "Since 2010, more than 50 UK fire deaths, have been reported as linked with emollients. This prompted the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to issue advice on their safer use in 2018. The advice was in response to concerns raised by the National Fire Chiefs Council, coroners' reports, and flammability tests. The test results show a significant reduction in ignition time of fabrics contaminated with paraffin-based and paraffin-free skin care product residues. The MHRA report also included advice on washing clothing and bedding at high temperatures but warned this may not remove all emollient residues. This paper reports on new research on the removal of skin care products from clothing investigated by laundering contaminated 100% cotton fabric at 30, 40 and 60 °C using both biological and non-biological based detergents. As part of the experiment, non-contaminated (blank) napkin samples were included in the wash experiments to assess the possible transfer from fabrics contaminated with emollients to uncontaminated clean fabrics during washing. Washed and dried fabrics were analysed using Attenuated Total Reflectance, Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and further interpreted via principal component analysis (PCA) and network analysis. Results suggest that the majority of the 6% white soft paraffin-based lotion and paraffin-free cream were removed at all temperatures. Residues of 21% paraffin-based cream (6% light paraffin/15% white soft paraffin) remain, and more residues persist of the 100% paraffin-based ointment (5% light paraffin/95% white soft paraffin) after washing at 30, 40 and 60 °C. The wash experiments show unequivocal transfer of the 100% ointment from the contaminated napkins to clean control napkins placed within washes at 30 °C. Furthermore, residues of the ointment were observed within the machine drum, and washing machine door seal, though this did not cause secondary transfer to subsequent wash experiments. There were no differences observed when using biological versus non-biological detergents, nor when employing a pre-wash treatment in the removal of residues of the 21% cream and 100% ointment. These results suggest that a single application of an emollient when soaked and dried into a fabric is not removed by a single wash at 30, 40 or 60 °C. Instead, the residue remains a persistent potential fire risk and, its high paraffin content presents an additional fire risk via contamination of other fabrics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have evaluated prophylactic emollients as a preventive strategy against atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy (FA). We aimed to synthesize the evidence on efficacy and safety of prophylactic emollients started during the first 6 weeks of infancy for prevention of AD and FA. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched systematically for randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 and July 2020, which assessed the effects of prophylactic emollients initiated within the first 6 weeks of life on the development of AD within 24 months of age, compared to no treatment. Risk of bias and certainty of evidence were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and GRADE process, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 1486 articles identified, 10 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. In infants given emollients, there was no significant reduction on the development of AD (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64, 1.10) compared to the control group. However, there was significant benefit of prophylactic emollients (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-1.11) in the high-risk population (n = 8 studies). There was also significant benefit (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43, 0.81) in studies (n = 6) where emollients were used continuously to the point of AD assessment; but not when treatment was ceased for an interval before AD assessment. There were no protective effects on FA found. CONCLUSION: The prophylactic application of emollients initiated in early infancy may prevent AD, especially in high-risk populations and when used continuously. We hypothesize that emollients may delay rather than prevent AD.",

Emollients can be used as a coadjutant therapy for psoriasis management, but little is known about how the epidermal barrier function in psoriatic patients is modified by moisturizers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of Vaseline jelly and a water-based formula on epidermal barrier function in psoriatic patients. Thirty-one patients with plaque-type psoriasis and thirty-one gender and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Temperature, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum hydration (SCH), pH, elasticity and the erythema index were measured using non-invasive tools before and after applying Vaseline jelly and a water-based formula. TEWL was higher in psoriatic plaques than uninvolved psoriatic skin (13.23 vs. 8.54 g·m-2·h-1; p < 0.001). SCH was lower in psoriatic plaques than uninvolved psoriatic skin and healthy skin (13.44 vs. 30.55 vs. 30.90 arbitrary units (AU), p < 0.001). In psoriatic plaques, TEWL decreased by 5.59 g·m-2·h-1 (p = 0.001) after applying Vaseline Jelly, while it increased by 3.60 g·m-2·h-1 (p = 0.006) after applying the water-based formula. SCH increased by 9.44 AU after applying the water-based formula (p = 0.003). The use of emollients may improve epidermal barrier function in psoriatic patients. TEWL is decreased by using Vaseline, and SCH is increased by using the water-based formula."

A 3-health state Markov model was designed, using French data for resource utilization, price and transition probabilities. The effects of the use of 5 different emollients (A, B, C, D, E) or no emollient were compared. The selected outcome was time (years) without flare-up (YWFU). The 5-year cost for emollient A is 1,575.64€, and the effectiveness is 3.89 YWFU. Strategy A is the most effective. Compared with treatment E, which was the least expensive emollient, A is more expensive (+481.84€) and more effective (0.082 YWFU). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is 5,877.48€/YWFU.

This predominantly pediatric disease is becoming more and more prevalent. Emollients are part of the therapeutic management and particularly a way to increase time between relapses. The follow-up of AD and relapses have a great impact on patient's quality of life, expenditures and society costs. The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of different emollients prescribed to AD patients. METHODS: A three-state Markov simulation model was developed over a six-year period with 28 days cycles. Two perspectives were adopted, a health care system perspective and a societal perspective. Four different emollients (A, B, C, D) were compared with no emollient use. Time without flare-up was the key endpoint of the study. quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed as a secondary outcome. Cost and effectiveness data were derived from (i) randomized clinical trials and literature review for the efficacy of treatments, (ii) resource utilization and quality of life data, and (iii) unit prices from official price lists. RESULTS: The six-year health care costs associated with emollient A amount to £1844.23 and generate 4.58 years-without flare-up. Compared to emollient B, emollient A is costlier (Δ £41) but more effective (0.097 years). The ICER is £428.30 per year without flare-up. Emollient A is the dominant strategy compared to no treatment (£2,251.01; 3.99 years without flare-ups). When accounting for the societal costs, emollient A is the dominant strategy. DISCUSSION: According to the analysis, treatment with preventive emollient was a cost-effective option compared with no treatment in adult AD patients. In this comparative study, emollient A is the most efficient strategy from a willingness to pay £200 with a probability of 49%."

      "abstract": "The skin is the largest organ in the human body. Among other components, it contains epidermal cells, which are modified epithelial cells that rest on a basal membrane that separates them from the dermis. When the epidermis presents variations in its structural composition and the distribution of its elements, the result is the loss of large amounts of water, which perpetuates these variations and leads to permanent dehydration. Emollients are the first line of treatment for pathologies that affect the hydration of the skin, such as atopic dermatitis, which is one of the most important ones. This document entails the description of the epidermal barrier with its main components and functions, the characteristics of an altered skin barrier, and the mechanisms for its repair. Subsequently, this paper includes the definition of emollient, hydration mechanisms for the recovery of the barrier, types of emollients, the situations that must be taken into account when the use of emollients is prescribed, evidence with or without connection with their advantages, and the key points at the time of its formulation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common skin disease among pediatric patients, which affects up to 20% of children worldwide. Characterized by pruritus and eczema, it is also associated with improper skin barrier function and allergen sensitization. Here, we aimed to assess the presence of haptens in emollients marketed in two European countries: in Poland and Spain, as, firstly, these products are considered to be AD's basic therapy, and, secondly, frequent application of potent sensitizers on atopic skin may result in contact dermatitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched for moisturizers explicitly described as \"Atopic skin care\" products in the most frequently visited online pharmacies in Poland and Spain. Subsequently, we created a database of all products and compared their composition with 139 contact haptens listed in the European Baseline Series (EBS), Fragrance and Cosmetic Series. RESULTS: As of December 2018, our list comprised 159 and 111 emollients available on the Polish and Spanish markets, respectively. There were no ingredients listed in 28 (17.5%) products in Poland and 24 (21.6%) in Spain. Only 23 (17.5%) and 13 (14.8%) products were hapten free. The pattern of most common haptens was similar in both countries, including phenoxyethanol, tocopherol and tocopheryl acetate, undefined parfum in Poland and tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, tocopheryl acetate and undefined parfum in Spain. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a vast majority of products taken into consideration contain at least one potential contact hapten. These findings indicate a need for patient education about potentially allergenic ingredients and stronger cooperation between academia and cosmetic manufacturers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic skin disorder often beginning in infancy. Skin barrier dysfunction early in life serves as a central event in the pathogenesis of AD. In infants at high risk of developing AD, preventative application of lipid-rich emollients may reduce the risk of developing AD. This study aims to measure the effectiveness of this intervention in a population not selected for risk via a pragmatic, randomized, physician-blinded trial in the primary care setting. METHODS: Infant-parent dyads are recruited from a primary care practice participating through one of four practice-based research networks in Oregon, Colorado, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Eligible dyads are randomized to the intervention (daily use of lipid-rich emollient) or the control (no emollient) group (n = 625 infants in each) and are followed for 24 months. The primary outcome is the cumulative incidence of physician-diagnosed AD and secondary outcomes include caregiver-reported measures of AD and development of other atopic diseases. Data collection occurs via chart review and surveys, with no study visits required. Data will be analyzed utilizing intention-to-treat principles. DISCUSSION: AD is a common skin condition in infants that affects quality of life and is associated with the development of other atopic diseases. If a safe intervention, such as application of lipid-rich emollients, in the general population effectively decreases AD prevalence, this could alter the guidance given by providers regarding routine skin care of infants. Because of the pragmatic design, we anticipate that this trial will yield generalizable results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03409367. Registered on 11 February 2018.",

Subjects were topically treated with desonide cream and emollients in Prinsepia utilis Royle for 2-4 weeks before entering the maintenance period and then differentially treated with either emollients for treatment or none for control. The cumulative maintenance rate, time to flare and improvement of eczema area and severity index (EASI) and infant's dermatitis quality of life index (IDQOL) were evaluated. Results showed that the cumulative maintenance rate of the treatment group (60.5%, 95% CI 50.0-69.4%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (23.5%, 95% CI 15.2-33.0%) (p < .001). The median time to flare in the treatment group was 90 days (interquartile range, IQR 28-90), which was significantly longer than that in the control group (28 days [IQR 18-67]) (p < .001). At Week 4 in the maintenance period, the EASI and IDQOL scores of the treatment group were lower than those of the control group. In conclusion, the application of emollients during the maintenance period of infantile AD can significantly reduce the risk of AD flares, prolong the time to flare and improve the clinical symptoms.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis/eczema affects around 20% of children and is characterised by inflamed, dry, itchy skin. Guidelines recommend 'leave-on' emollients that are applied directly to the skin to add or trap moisture and used regularly, they can soothe, enhance the skin barrier and may prevent disease 'flares'. However, the suitability of the many different emollients varies between people and there is little evidence to help prescribers and parents and carers decide which type to try first. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Design: pragmatic, multicentre, individually randomised, parallel group superiority trial of four types of emollient (lotions, creams, gel or ointments). SETTING: general practitioner surgeries in England. PARTICIPANTS: children aged over 6 months and less than 12 years with mild-to-severe eczema and no known sensitivity to study emollients. INTERVENTIONS: study-approved lotion, cream, gel or ointment as the only leave-on emollient for 16 weeks, with directions to apply twice daily and as required. Other treatments, such as topical corticosteroids, used as standard care. FOLLOW-UP: 52 weeks. PRIMARY OUTCOME: validated patient-orientated eczema measure measured weekly for 16 weeks. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: eczema signs (Eczema Area Severity Index) by masked researcher, treatment use, parent satisfaction, adverse events, child and family quality of life (Atopic Dermatitis Quality of Life, Child Health Utility 9D and Dermatitis Family Impact). SAMPLE SIZE: 520 participants (130 per group). ANALYSIS: intention-to-treat using linear mixed models for repeated measures.Nested qualitative study: audio-recording of sample of baseline appointments and up to 60 interviews with participants at 4 and 16 weeks, interviews to be transcribed and analysed thematically. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval granted by the NHS REC (South West - Central Bristol Research Ethics Committee 17/SW/0089). Findings will be presented at conferences, published in open-access peer-reviewed journals and the study website; and summaries shared with key stakeholders.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite decades of use, the actual amounts of topical corticosteroids (TCS) and emollients used in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) under real-world conditions are unknown. Thus, it remains unclear whether inadequate use is widespread. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the use of TCS and emollients in moderate-to-severe AD. METHODS: Double-blinded drug prescribing was recorded prospectively at the point of drug dispensing within a catchment area of approximately 450 000 people over a 31-year period in a population-based cohort marked by failure of disease control in primary care (n = 844). For each patient, prescribing was recorded over a 12-month period in order to minimize fluctuations. RESULTS: This approach resulted in a near-complete dataset, which was essentially free of reporting bias and recording bias. Atopic comorbidities matched expected frequencies. Median use of TCS was statistically significantly higher in juvenile patients (age < 16 years) compared with adult patients (49·2 vs. 38·1 g per month), in male vs. female patients (46·8 vs. 29·7 g per month) and in patients receiving concurrent asthma treatment (40·4 vs. 26·7 g per month). TCS use was strongly associated with antidepressant treatment. Emollient use was unexpectedly low with a median of 9·6 g per day (range 1·4-30·1). Results were replicated in an independent validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Deficient use of emollients may be a factor contributing to AD severity. Our analysis showed that the use of TCS does not exceed current guidelines. Accurate quantification of topical treatments provides a widely accessible strategy to measure the real-world impact of novel AD treatments. What's already known about this topic? Both emollient and topical corticosteroid (TCS) use have been a mainstay of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment for over 60 years. The actual quantities used by patients under real-world conditions are unknown. What does this study add? The real-world use of emollients is fourfold lower than the amount recommended in current guidelines. Underuse of emollients may be a significant factor in disease exacerbation. The use of TCS is significantly higher in male patients and is higher in patients with AD who also have asthma. The use of TCS is strongly associated with concurrent antidepressant treatment.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a cream containing topical PUFAs, humectants and emollients on clinical signs of equine Culicoides hypersensitivity. ANIMALS: Privately owned horses (n = 28) with clinical signs of Culicoides hypersensitivity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For a period of four weeks, one half of the horse's body (left or right) was treated with a cream containing concentrated fish oil and several moisturizing and emollient ingredients in a randomized, single-blinded fashion to evaluate the influence of the treatment on skin lesions. In the subsequent four weeks, the lesional areas of the entire body were treated to assess the treatment effect on pruritus. Additionally, the quality of the hair coat, an overall assessment and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-one horses completed the study. Skin lesions on the treated side improved significantly between days 0 and 28 (P < 0.0001) in comparison to the untreated side. Neither pruritus scores nor coat quality improved significantly between days 0 and 56. Overall condition improved during the study. Five horses showed adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The cream improved Culicoides-induced skin lesions in affected horses, but anti-pruritic effects were less prominent.",

Czynnikami wywołującymi są mutacje w genie kodującym filagrynę, rozregulowanie układu immunologicznego, zmiany dotyczące mikrobiomu skóry i lipidów w stratum corneum, niedobór peptydów antymikrobiologicznych AMPs. Choroba dotyczy głównie dzieci, powodując znaczne pogorszenie jakości życia, a jej pierwsze objawy występują w około 90% przypadków przed ukończeniem 5. r.ż. Przez lata termin „emolienty” odnoszono do substancji natłuszczających stosowanych w celu uelastycznienia i zmiękczenia skóry w chorobach przebiegających z szorstkością, złuszczaniem i suchością skóry. Obecnie wiadomo, że emolienty mogą także działać nawilżająco poprzez zatrzymywanie wody w skórze, stąd często terminy „emolient” i „substancja nawilżająca” są używane zamiennie. Zgodnie z najnowszymi rekomendacjami towarzystw dermatologicznych podstawową terapią w atopowym zapaleniu skóry jest długotrwałe stosowanie preparatów emoliencyjnych aplikowanych regularnie na skórę oraz dodawanych do kąpieli. Emolienty mogą być stosowane w monoterapii lub –w okresach zaostrzeń –w skojarzeniu z miejscowo stosowanymi kortykosteroidami lub inhibitorami kalcyneuryny. Badania kliniczne wykazały, że systematyczne stosowanie preparatów emoliencyjnych pomaga zarówno przywrócić funkcje ochronne bariery skórnej, jak i wpływa na zmniejszenie zużycia miejscowo stosowanych kortykosteroidów u niemowląt, dzieci i dorosłych pacjentów z atopowym zapaleniem skory. Wyniki badań oraz wieloletnie doświadczenie kliniczne dowodzą skuteczności i bezpieczeństwa stosowania preparatów emoliencyjnych. W pracy przedstawiono aktualny stan wiedzy na temat emolientów, tj. przegląd składników preparatów emoliencyjnych, właściwości i mechanizmy działania emolientów, a także omówiono ich znaczenie w atopowym zapaleniu skóry oraz wyniki badań klinicznych przeprowadzonych z udziałem dzieci z atopowym zapaleniem skóry.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Emollient therapy is the mainstay for treating skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. New emollients have been introduced recently and are assumed to be therapeutically interchangeable with the innovator products because, superficially, they appear to have similar compositions. This study compares a) the ex vivo human skin occlusion performance and b) the visual and microscopic properties of Isomol gel (IMG) and Doublebase gel (DBG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Occlusion was measured gravimetrically by reduction in cumulative 48-hour evaporative weight loss from ex vivo human skin samples following single applications of the two test emollients and Vaseline®. Skin samples from a single donor were mounted in Franz diffusion cells and then the emollients were spread over the skin surface with an applied dose of approximately 2 mg/cm2. The assemblies (four replicates per treatment) were then accurately weighed at baseline (T0) and again after 5-, 24-, and 48-hour postapplication. The quality of the two emollient gel formulations was compared by visual examination of their film-forming characteristics and by microstructural examination using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). RESULTS: Occlusivity of the DBG emollient gel formulation was comparable with Vaseline and substantially better than IMG, with the DBG-treated skin samples losing less than half as much weight as the IMG-treated skin samples over 48 hours and at a much slower rate during the first 5 hours. The film-forming characteristics and microstructure of the gels were also very different. Whereas DBG maintained a smooth, uniform film over 24 hours, the IMG formulation phase-separated. ESEM results showed that the DBG emulsion has a stable structural matrix with uniform oil droplets, whereas for IMG the emulsion system is inhomogeneous with the oil phase coalescing into larger irregular shaped rafts. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated substantial performance differences between two prescribed emollient gels."

The study objective was to investigate short-term and long-term effects of two emollients on symptoms and skin barrier functions in xerotic eczema. Randomized, double-blind, study enrolling females/males, with bilateral itching. Two emollients, containing lactic acid and refined almond oil with/without polidocanol were administered on left versus right body sides. Itching severity, skin moisture, lipid content, and pH were assessed on Day 1, within 30-120 min after first administration, and on Days 7 and 14, and compared with baseline assessments. Severity of itching decreased 30 min after first administration of both emollients compared with baseline (p < .0001) and reached a maximum reduction of 63% (p < .0001) and 69% (p < .0001) on Day 14. Skin moisture and lipid content increased after first application, and further ameliorated within 14 days of treatment (p < .0001). Both emollients were tolerated well, and only a few adverse events were reported. This study confirmed the clinical efficacy of the two study emollients to substantially reduce itching already after first administration, and restore skin barrier integrity and thus should be considered as therapeutic approach for xerotic eczema.",

OBJECTIVE: In this in vivo study, the effects of topical petrolatum, basis cream, glycerine, and olive oil on the transmission of ultraviolet A radiation were investigated. METHODS: A test was performed to determine the minimal phototoxic dose on 29 volunteers with only psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and then the same test was repeated with white petrolatum, basis cream, glycerine, olive oil, and sunscreen (0.3cc/25cm2). The effects of each agent on the minimal phototoxic dose were determined after 72 h. RESULTS: When compared to pure PUVA, there was a statistically significant increase in the mean minimal phototoxic dose values by the application of white petrolatum (P = 0.011), but there was no significant increase or decrease in the mean minimal phototoxic dose values after the application of basis cream (P = 0.326), glycerine (P = 0.611) or olive oil (P = 0.799). STUDY LIMITATIONS: Low number of patients Conclusion: The application of white petrolatum, which has a blocking effect, and also of basis cream immediately before PUVA therapy should not be recommended. Although we specify that glycerine and maybe olive oil can be used before photochemotherapy, there is a need for further research in larger series.",

OBJECTIVES: To explore the use of emollients and topical glucocorticoids in adolescents with eczema in relation to sex and disease severity, and to study dispensing patterns of topical glucocorticoids. METHODS: Questionnaire-based data on symptoms of eczema, eczema severity and treatment with emollients and topical glucocorticoids were obtained from 3108 adolescents in the Swedish population-based birth cohort BAMSE. Severity of reported eczema was evaluated with the BAMSE Eczema Severity Score (BESS) in a questionnaire and with the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure in clinically examined patients with current eczema (n = 247). Information on dispensed topical glucocorticoids was obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. RESULTS: In all, 10% of the adolescents reported eczema in the preceding year: 73% mild, 17% moderate and 10% severe according to BESS. Almost all used emollients, whereas use of topical glucocorticoids was reported by 55%, with no significant difference between sexes. The likelihood of treatment with emollients and topical glucocorticoids increased when the adolescents had symptoms of current eczema [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5·95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·90-18·8], but not if they had more severe eczema compared with mild eczema (adjusted OR 1·57, 95% CI 0·58-4·25). Among those with reported eczema, 24% had a topical glucocorticoid dispensed in the preceding year, and among those with moderate-to-severe current eczema 24% had a dispensed potent topical glucocorticoid. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study indicates that adolescents with eczema are undertreated or completely untreated, even those with severe eczema.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Eczema or Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic relapsing skin disease associated with impaired quality of life. Regular usage of moisturizer/emollient is the mainstay of management but acceptability of emollient is often suboptimal. We investigated if emollient acceptability is influenced by various clinical factors in AD. METHODS: A survey on frequency of emollient usage, brands, clinical factors including disease severity (Nottingham Eczema Severity Score, NESS), quality of life (Children Dermatology Life Quality Index, CDLQI), Transpidermal Water Loss (TEWL), and Skin Hydration (SH) was performed. Acceptability was classified as very good, good, fair or poor. RESULTS: We evaluated 128 AD patients. NESS correlated with CDLQI and the treatment domain of CDLQI. Emollient usage is elementary for AD treatment. 89.1% of patients reported that doctor's recommendation was the major source of advice when choosing an emollient. Aqueous cream (AQ) and petroleum-derived products were among the commonly used emollients. More aqueous cream users reported fair/poor acceptability (p=0.017) and lower SH (p<0.05). Linear regression showed that patients who thought their emollient as fair or poor were currently using AQ (p=0.003), their emollient not recommended by a doctor (p=0.035), with more severe disease (p=0.04), and had lower emollient usage in winter (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: Physicians play a pivotal role in assisting patients to select an emollient that they will accept and use consistently. The studied emollients are generally acceptable by over 80% patients. However, aqueous cream is least acceptable by patients, making it the least favorable emollient to recommend to patients.",

We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Skin Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the GREAT database and five trial registers to December 2015. We included 77 RCTs with 6603 participants. Seven studies (9%) were at low risk of bias, 34 (44%) had unclear risk and 36 (47%) were at high risk. The quality of the evidence was mainly low or moderate for the prespecified outcomes. The most important comparison, 'moisturizer vs. no moisturizer', showed improved Scoring Atopic Dermatitis values in the moisturizer group compared with no moisturizer [mean difference -2·42, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4·55 to -0·28], but did not meet the minimal important difference of 8·7. Fewer flares were seen (risk ratio 0·40, 95% CI 0·23-0·70) and the rate of flares was reduced (hazard ratio 3·74, 95% CI 1·86-7·50). The groups applying moisturizer used less topical corticosteroids over 6-8 weeks (mean difference -9·30 g, 95% CI 15·3 to -3·27).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Eczema is a chronic skin disease characterised by dry skin, intense itching, inflammatory skin lesions, and a considerable impact on quality of life. Moisturisation is an integral part of treatment, but it is unclear if moisturisers are effective. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of moisturisers for eczema. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases to December 2015: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the GREAT database. We searched five trials registers and checked references of included and excluded studies for further relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in people with eczema. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We included 77 studies (6603 participants, mean age: 18.6 years, mean duration: 6.7 weeks). We assessed 36 studies as at a high risk of bias, 34 at unclear risk, and seven at low risk. Twenty-four studies assessed our primary outcome 'participant-assessed disease severity', 13 assessed 'satisfaction', and 41 assessed 'adverse events'. Secondary outcomes included investigator-assessed disease severity (addressed in 65 studies), skin barrier function (29), flare prevention (16), quality of life (10), and corticosteroid use (eight). Adverse events reporting was limited (smarting, stinging, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis).Six studies evaluated moisturiser versus no moisturiser. 'Participant-assessed disease severity' and 'satisfaction' were not assessed. Moisturiser use yielded lower SCORAD than no moisturiser (three studies, 276 participants, mean difference (MD) -2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.55 to -0.28), but the minimal important difference (MID) (8.7) was unmet. There were fewer flares with moisturisers (two studies, 87 participants, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.70), time to flare was prolonged (median: 180 versus 30 days), and less topical corticosteroids were needed (two studies, 222 participants, MD -9.30 g, 95% CI -15.3 to -3.27). There was no statistically significant difference in adverse events (one study, 173 participants, risk ratio (RR) 15.34, 95% CI 0.90 to 261.64). Evidence for these outcomes was low quality.With Atopiclair (three studies), 174/232 participants experienced improvement in participant-assessed disease severity versus 27/158 allocated to vehicle (RR 4.51, 95% CI 2.19 to 9.29). Atopiclair decreased itching (four studies, 396 participants, MD -2.65, 95% CI -4.21 to -1.09) and achieved more frequent satisfaction (two studies, 248 participants, RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.89), fewer flares (three studies, 397 participants, RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.31), and lower EASI (four studies, 426 participants, MD -4.0, 95% CI -5.42 to -2.57), but MID (6.6) was unmet. The number of participants reporting adverse events was not statistically different (four studies, 430 participants, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.33). Evidence for these outcomes was moderate quality.Participants reported skin improvement more frequently with urea-containing cream than placebo (one study, 129 participants, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.53; low-quality evidence), with equal satisfaction between the two groups (one study, 38 participants, low-quality evidence). Urea-containing cream improved dryness (investigator-assessed) more frequently (one study, 128 participants, RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.71; moderate-quality evidence) with fewer flares (one study, 44 participants, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.92; low-quality evidence), but more participants in this group reported adverse events (one study, 129 participants, RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.34; moderate-quality evidence).Three studies assessed glycerol-containing moisturiser versus vehicle or placebo. More participants in the glycerol group noticed skin improvement (one study, 134 participants, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.48; moderate-quality evidence), and this group saw improved investigator-assessed SCORAD (one study, 249 participants, MD -2.20, 95% CI -3.44 to -0.96; high-quality evidence), but MID was unmet. Participant satisfaction was not addressed. The number of participants reporting adverse events was not statistically significant (two studies, 385 participants, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.19; moderate-quality evidence).Four studies investigated oat-containing moisturisers versus no treatment or vehicle. No significant differences between groups were reported for participant-assessed disease severity (one study, 50 participants, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.46; low-quality evidence), satisfaction (one study, 50 participants, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.52; very low-quality evidence), and investigator-assessed disease severity (three studies, 272 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.23, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.21; low-quality evidence). In the oat group, there were fewer flares (one study, 43 participants, RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.7; low-quality evidence) and less topical corticosteroids needed (two studies, 222 participants, MD -9.30g, 95% CI 15.3 to -3.27; low-quality evidence), but more adverse events were reported (one study, 173 participants; Peto odds ratio (OR) 7.26, 95% CI 1.76 to 29.92; low-quality evidence).All moisturisers above were compared to placebo, vehicle, or no moisturiser. Participants considered moisturisers more effective in reducing eczema (five studies, 572 participants, RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.23; low-quality evidence) and itch (seven studies, 749 participants, SMD -1.10, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.38) than control. Participants in both treatment arms reported comparable satisfaction (three studies, 296 participants, RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.26; low-quality evidence). Moisturisers led to lower investigator-assessed disease severity (12 studies, 1281 participants, SMD -1.04, 95% CI -1.57 to -0.51; high-quality evidence) and fewer flares (six studies, 607 participants, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.62; moderate-quality evidence), but there was no difference in adverse events (10 studies, 1275 participants, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; moderate-quality evidence).Topical active treatment combined with moisturiser was more effective than active treatment alone in reducing investigator-assessed disease severity (three studies, 192 participants, SMD -0.87, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.57; moderate-quality evidence) and flares (one study, 105 participants, RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.93), and was preferred by participants (both low-quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in number of adverse events (one study, 125 participants, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.19; very low-quality evidence). Participant-assessed disease severity was not addressed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most moisturisers showed some beneficial effects, producing better results when used with active treatment, prolonging time to flare, and reducing the number of flares and amount of topical corticosteroids needed to achieve similar reductions in eczema severity. We did not find reliable evidence that one moisturiser is better than another.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, comparative study was conducted with 60 patients with moderate AD. Before starting the study, participants were pretreated for 15 days with drug therapy to improve their SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) by at least 25%. On Day 1, the eligible patients were randomized to either the emollient containing LRP-VFB associated with mannose (Product A) or another emollient (product B) and were treated twice daily for 1 month. Recurrence of flare-ups and microbial communities were characterized from swabs taken at Day 1 and Day 28, under axenic conditions, from affected (AF) and proximal unaffected (UAF) skin areas. RESULTS: At Day 1, the average SCORAD of each group and the microbial communities of AF and UAF areas for each participant were similar. One month after the end of the therapeutic treatment (Day 28), the average evolution of SCORAD at Day 28 compared to Day 1 of patients treated with product A was significantly lower than that of the patients treated with product B. A significantly increased level of Xanthomonas genus was noticed in the group treated with product A (versus product B). On the other hand, the level of Staphylococcus genus increased between Day 1 and Day 28 in the group treated with product B, but not in the group treated with product A. Interestingly, these differences were more pronounced for patients in relapse, and the associated SCORAD worsening was less in the group treated with product A versus the group treated with product B. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a specific emollient containing a biomass of non-pathogenic bacteria Vf grown in a medium containing TSW and associated with a selected carbon source is able to normalize skin microbiota and significantly reduce the number and severity of flare-ups compared with another emollient."

The first cohort (18 volunteers) treated the volar side of one forearm with two fingertip units of Doublebase™ gel twice daily for 4 weeks. The second cohort (19 volunteers) undertook the same regimen using Diprobase® cream. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum integrity and hydration, skin surface pH and redness were determined at the test sites before and after treatment. RESULTS: Neither Diprobase® cream nor Doublebase™ gel significantly affected the underlying skin barrier function. Both emollients were associated with significantly increased skin surface pH immediately after application (by 0·8 ± 0·19 and 1·0 ± 0·18 units, respectively), and no erythema. Diprobase® cream artificially and transiently (6 h) improved permeability barrier function by 2·9-3·1 g m-2  h-1 TEWL and increased skin hydration by 6·0-6·2 units. Doublebase™ gel, containing humectants, was associated with a greater (between 10·1 and 13·0 units during the first 6 h) and more sustained increase in hydration, lasting more than 12 h following repeated use. CONCLUSIONS: Diprobase® cream and Doublebase™ gel are not associated with skin barrier harm and appear to be appropriate for AD treatment. While displaying emollient properties, neither formulation displayed an ability to actively improve sustained skin barrier function.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Leave-on emollients form the mainstay of eczema treatment, but adherence is poor. We aimed to explore parents'/carers' views on effectiveness and acceptability of leave-on emollients for childhood eczema through secondary analysis of data from 2 qualitative data sets. SETTING: Study 1 recruited through mail-out from 6 general practices in southern England. Study 2 recruited from a feasibility trial of an intervention to support eczema self-care in 31 practices in the same area. PARTICIPANTS: Study 1 included 28 interviews with carers of children aged ≤5 years with eczema. Study 2 included 26 interviews with carers of children aged ≤5 years with eczema. METHODS: Interviews followed semistructured guides: study 1 explored carers' understandings around eczema treatments in order to develop a web-based self-care support intervention; study 2 explored carers' understandings of eczema and eczema treatments after using the intervention. Interviews were carried out face to face or by telephone, audio-recorded and transcribed. Secondary analysis of data from both studies focused on views and experiences of emollient use. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach facilitated by NVivo V.10 software. RESULTS: In study 1, most participants felt emollients improved eczema but held mixed views about long-term use to prevent flare-ups. In study 2, where carers had used the web-based intervention, all participants held positive views about long-term emollient use. In both studies, participants expressed a range of preferences about emollient 'thickness'; some felt that 'thick' emollients (ointments) were most effective, while others found these difficult to use. Carers described a process of 'trial and error', trying emollients suggested by professionals, friends and family, or bought over-the-counter. Carers expressed a need for understanding differences between products and their effective use. CONCLUSIONS: Providing a rationale for long-term emollient use and choice of emollients could help improve adherence and help families gain more rapid control of eczema.",

METHODS: An expert panel of 8 Canadian dermatologists explored the role of skin microbiome in clinical dermatology, specifically looking at atopic dermatitis. RESULTS: The panel reached consensus on the following: (1) In atopic patients, the skin microbiome of lesional atopic skin is different from nonlesional skin in adjacent areas. (2) Worsening atopic dermatitis and smaller bacterial diversity are strongly associated. (3) Application of emollients containing antioxidant and antibacterial components may increase microbiome diversity in atopic skin.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a common chronic disease with significant impairment in quality of life. As there is no cure, it often requires lifelong disease control to minimize the development of skin lesions and to relieve symptoms. The aim of this publication is to systematically review the role of currently used emollients and keratolytics in the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline via PubMed regarding reviews, meta-analyses, and trials published from January 1983 to December 2013 dealing with topical administration of emollients and keratolytics in patients with psoriasis. A subsequent search in EMBASE regarding clinical trials published from 1983 to 2013 was performed to complement the findings. RESULTS: A total of 60 publications met the inclusion criteria for full-text evaluation. While current reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines state that adjuvant therapy with emollients and keratolytics should be an obligatory part in the therapy of psoriasis to facilitate descaling and/or penetration enhancement, comprehensive trials on these agents are missing, with the exception of combination products containing salicylic acid and corticosteroids. In the mentioned trials, addition of salicylic acid was beneficial in inducing a more rapid onset of action as well as a reduction of severity parameters and the area affected. However, its use has substantial limitations in young children, in patients with renal/hepatic impairment, with widespread psoriasis, those undergoing phototherapy, or those concomitantly treated with calcipotriene/systemic salicylates. CONCLUSION: In view of these shortcomings, there is a need for well-designed studies on suitable keratolytic alternatives to salicylic acid offering an indisputable positive benefit-risk ratio."

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disorder that has strong financial and psychosocial impacts. Its pathogenesis is related to increased transepidermal water loss due to a defective skin epidermal barrier. Emollients serve as first-line therapy during both acute flares and remission. However, their use is poorly characterized, posing therapeutic challenges to clinicians and patients. In this article, we review available evidence to provide recommendations, aiming to standardize and optimize the use of emollients in AD. Literature search was performed using Pubmed and Google. All articles were retrieved using Pubmed. Recommendations were graded based on the British Medical Journal's Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system and the American Academy of Family Physicians' Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy. Emollients should be applied post-bathing. However, the need for immediate application is debatable. The optimal frequency for application is still undetermined, but multiple applications daily are encouraged. Ideally, a balance should be achieved between patient's compliance and clinical efficacy. Emollients hold the potential to act as steroid-sparing agents, but more well-designed studies are pertinent for a definite conclusion. At present, it is recommended that 250-500 g of emollients be applied every week. Finally, primary prevention of AD by regular application of emollients in high-risk infants cannot yet be recommended.",

Lactobacillus sakei probio 65, isolated from the Korean vegetable-based product kimchi, can decrease interleukin 4 and immunoglobulin E levels and inhibit Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, it has reportedly shown positive dermatological effects in both animal and clinical studies. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of an emollient that contains Lactobacillus (treated) with a normal emollient (control) on AD. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, split-body clinical trial involved 28 patients with AD. The patients applied the Lactobacillus-containing emollient on one side of their body and the control emollient on the other side twice daily for 4 weeks. Trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin capacitance were evaluated and investigator global assessment and the visual analogue scale (VAS) were administered on weeks 0, 1, 2, and 4. RESULTS: The treated sides had significantly lower TEWL and VAS values and significantly higher skin capacitance values over time than the control sides. CONCLUSION: Topical application of Lactobacillus-containing emollients may improve the skin permeability of patients with AD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Topical applications of emollients such as sunflower seed oil and Aquaphor have been shown to reduce the incidence of bloodstream infections and mortality of preterm infants in resource-poor settings. The causal mechanism for prevention of infection through cutaneous portals of entry is not well understood. METHODS: We examined the relationship between skin condition score as a measure of skin barrier integrity and risk for bloodstream infection, and the effect of emollients on that relationship. Data for this study come from a randomized controlled trial of the impact of topical emollient therapy on nosocomial infections in 491 preterm infants <33 weeks gestational age at Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Bangladesh. Latent growth trajectory model with random-coefficient and multivariable logistic regression were utilized. RESULTS: Rate of deterioration of skin condition was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in both emollient arms compared with the untreated control group. Adjusted odds ratio of skin score for infection was 1.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.65). Emollients reduced the incidence of infection only when the skin had no signs of deterioration [Aquaphor incidence rate ratio: 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.97) and sunflower seed oil incidence rate ratio: 0.46 (95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.99)]. CONCLUSION: Skin condition deteriorated progressively after birth and compromised skin condition increased the risk of infection. Emollients preserved skin integrity and thus prevented infection in preterm neonates. To optimize benefits of emollients for the prevention of bloodstream infection, use of emollients should begin immediately after birth when the skin is still intact.",

Little is known about the distinct effects of emollient use in children with dry skin and atopic predisposition. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of daily application of pressed ice plant juice (PIPJ)-based emollients and petrolatum-based emollients. METHODS: Children aged 2-6 years with dry skin and atopic predisposition were randomized into 2 groups: group 1 received emollients containing PIPJ and natural lipids, while group 2 received petrolatum-based emollients. Skin condition and biophysical properties of the skin barrier were assessed at inclusion and weeks 4, 12 and 16. RESULTS: Skin condition improved significantly in all children. Comparing the groups, children treated with emollients containing PIPJ showed significantly higher stratum corneum hydration values and significantly lower transepidermal water loss values at week 16 on the forearm and forehead. A significant decrease in skin pH was noted in group 2 on the forearm and forehead; group 1 showed a stable course. CONCLUSION: Early intervention with emollients in children with dry skin condition and atopic predisposition may improve their skin condition during daily emollient application. PIPJ-based formulations may be helpful to maintain skin barrier integrity.",

WWT often serves as crisis intervention for AD. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the use of WWT with diluted corticosteroids in comparison with emollient in children with severe AD during 4 weeks in a proactive schedule during which the frequency of corticosteroid applications was tapered. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in children aged 6 months to 10 years with severe AD (objective SCORAD at least 40 ± 5), comparing WWT with diluted corticosteroids (1:3 mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment and for the face 1:19 mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment under a mask) with emollient (petrolatum 20% in cetomacrogol cream). The primary outcome was improvement of the objective SCORAD; secondary outcomes included Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure and quality-of-life index. RESULTS: WWT with diluted corticosteroids acted faster and was more efficacious than WWT with emollients. Best results were obtained in age groups 6 to 9 years and 0 to 3 years. The difference in efficacy evaluated by objective SCORAD was significant at all measuring points. This also applied to the quality-of-life index. LIMITATIONS: The study group was relatively small. CONCLUSIONS: WWT for severe AD is an effective therapy option for at least a period of 4 weeks.",

TCS are associated with cutaneous atrophy and tachyphylaxis and TCIs can be irritating and contain a black box warning of an increased risk of cancers including lymphoma and non-melanomatous skin cancers. Nevertheless, they are appropriate treatments for inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) and should be used more often with disease flares and less as maintenance therapy. Given the associated risks of long-term continuous use with these pharmacologic agents, alternatives are needed with similar anti-inflammatory and barrier repair properties that can be used indefinitely without risk. Some over-the-counter (OTC) ingredients such as colloidal oatmeal and petrolatum, as well as anti-inflammatory prescription moisturizers (medical device creams), have demonstrated efficacy with little complications in skin barrier repair and symptom relief in steroid-responsive conditions. With regimented application, these non-drug options are safe and effective and can limit the longterm continuous use of TCS or TCIs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate whether treatment with potent local steroids can reduce signs and symptoms of acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) compared to emollient creams. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was randomised and double-blinded. Patients with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery were included when they started adjuvant 3-D planned RT. In all, 104 patients were randomised 2:1:1 to three treatment groups, i.e. betamethasone+Essex® cream, Essex® cream or Canoderm® cream. The patients themselves treated the irradiated area during the radiation period (5 weeks) and two weeks after cessation of RT. Signs of RT dermatitis were measured qualitatively with RTOG clinical scoring and quantitatively by colorimeter. In addition, the patients' symptoms were recorded as well as the Fitzpatrick skin type. There was a statistically significant difference (p=0.05) in skin reactions when assessed with RTOG in favour of the group treated with the potent steroid. Patient-related symptoms did not differ between the treatment groups. The effect of the steroid was prominent in three subgroups, i.e. (i) patients treated with ablation of the breast, (ii) patients receiving RT to the armpit and the supraclavicular fossa, and (iii) patients with Fitzpatrick skin type 1. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with betamethasone cream is more efficient than moisturizers for the control of acute RT dermatitis in patients treated with adjuvant RT for breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) Science and Research Department was commissioned by the Department of Health to develop national care pathways for children with allergies. The eczema pathway focuses on defining the competences to improve the equity of care received by children with eczema. METHOD: The eczema pathway was developed by a multidisciplinary working group and was based on a comprehensive review of evidence. The pathway was reviewed by a broad group of stakeholders including paediatricians, allergists, dermatologists, specialist nurses, dietician, patients' representatives and approved by the Allergy Care Pathways Project Board and the RCPCH Clinical Standards Committee. It was also reviewed by a wide range of stakeholders. RESULTS: The results are presented in three sections: the evidence review, mapping and the core knowledge document. The various entry points to the ideal pathway of care are defined from self-care through to follow-up. There is considerable emphasis on good skin care and when allergy problems should be dealt with. The pathway algorithm and associated competences can be downloaded from http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/allergy/eczema. CONCLUSIONS: Effective eczema management is holistic and encompasses an assessment of severity and impact on quality of life, treatment of the inflamed epidermal skin barrier, recognition and treatment of infection and assessment and management of environmental and allergy triggers. Patient and family education which seeks to maximise understanding and concordance with treatment is also important in all children with eczema.",

As a result of this, problems with untreated dry skin can lead to a variety of issues. Conditions such as pruritus and ichthyosis vulgaris can be distressing, while ezcema and psoriasis can lead to more serious consequences such as fissures and infections and can result in a reduced quality of life and social isolation. However, with appropriate treatments such as emollient therapy, the incidences of these conditions occurring can be reduced. Despite a wide range of choice available on the market, choosing an effective emollient which will help aid concordance is often difficult. In order to achieve this, several factors need to be considered in conjunction with the product selection. This article discusses the various factors that nurses need to consider when advising patients on which emollient to use as part of their skin care regimen, in order to improve concordance and patient outcomes.",

Heparinoid mucopolysaccharide creams or lotions are emulsion ointments for moisturizing the skin. The objective of this study was to investigate the view among adult AD patients regarding the effectiveness of emollients. We developed a questionnaire at our University Hospital to characterize how patients with AD viewed the efficacy of emollients. Patients were asked to participate prior to treatment and the questionnaire was given within 1 month of treatment. The severity of AD was graded as mild, moderate, severe or very severe. The severity scoring was performed only when the participants answered the questionnaire. Of the 110 enrolled AD patients, 103 returned the completed questionnaires. Ninety-eight patients (95.1%) used heparinoid mucopolysaccharide creams or lotions. There was a strong correlation between their view of the efficacy of the emollient and the condition of dry skin, pruritus and eczematous skin. There was a significant correlation between AD severity and the perceived efficacy of the emollient for dry skin, pruritus and eczematous skin. There was a greater sense of efficacy among patients with milder AD than in more severe AD cases. Patients who felt sufficient efficacy of the emollient for pruritus were significantly older than those who felt there was no efficacy. In addition, the age of onset of AD was significantly higher among those who felt sufficient efficacy for pruritus compared to those who felt little efficacy. We speculate that the efficacy of emollients could be demonstrated in the treatment of milder AD, but may only have partial efficacy in more severe cases. Emollient therapy might have lower efficacy for pruritus among younger or earlier onset AD patients.",

The use of emollients to maintain skin hydration and help restore barrier function, remains the principal treatment. Unfortunately, many health professionals, and patients themselves, fail to consider emollients an active treatment and may overlook the vital role they play in the maintenance of intact, healthy skin. Despite the overwhelming acceptance of the importance of emollient therapy, there remains a lack of good quality evidence on their effectiveness or whether one is better than another. Even when appropriate emollients are supplied, they are often used incorrectly or accompanied by conflicting/limited advice from health professionals.

Few studies have looked at the in vivo use of emollients or calcipotriol prior to narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B (NB-UVB) treatment. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether emollients or calcipotriol alter MED readings of skin on the back of healthy subjects prior to NB-UVB irradiation. METHODS: Topical agents were applied to the backs of 20 healthy volunteers for 30 min prior to MED testing. These agents were aqueous cream, 50:50 white soft paraffin and liquid paraffin, Diprobase(®) (Schering-Plough, Welwyn Garden City, U.K.), Epaderm(®) (Medlock, Oldham, U.K.) and calcipotriol ointment and cream. A control MED strip was used with no topical agent applied prior to testing. MED readings were recoded as integer steps between 1 and 9 (one is lowest MED dose for skin type; eight is highest; nine is no response, i.e. a higher MED). RESULTS: The median MED was between step 5 and 6 for all treatments and control. There was no significant difference at the 5% level between control and each topical agent. The study was powered to detect a median difference of approximately 0·4-0·6 steps. CONCLUSIONS: This has important implications at a practical level when advising patients not to apply creams prior to treatment with NB-UVB. Studies where agents are applied immediately prior to phototherapy have been more likely to show that emollients block transmission of UV radiation. If they are applied at least 30 min prior to treatment, they have no effect.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of topical emollients, sunflower seed oil (SSO) and synthetic Aquaphor, versus no treatment, in preventing mortality among hospitalized preterm infants (< 33 weeks gestation) at a tertiary hospital in Bangladesh. METHODS: Evidence from a randomized controlled efficacy trial was evaluated using standard Monte Carlo simulation. Programme costs were obtained from a retrospective review of activities. Patient costs were collected from patient records. Health outcomes were calculated as deaths averted and discounted years of life lost (YLLs) averted. Results were deemed cost-effective if they fell below a ceiling ratio based on the per capita gross national income of Bangladesh (United States dollars, US$ 470). FINDINGS: Aquaphor and SSO were both highly cost-effective relative to control, reducing neonatal mortality by 26% and 32%, respectively. SSO cost US$ 61 per death averted and US$ 2.15 per YLL averted (I$ 6.39, international dollars, per YLL averted). Aquaphor cost US$ 162 per death averted and US$ 5.74 per YLL averted (I$ 17.09 per YLL averted). Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. Aquaphor was cost-effective relative to SSO with 77% certainty: it cost an incremental US$ 26 more per patient treated, but averted 1.25 YLLs (US$ 20.74 per YLL averted). CONCLUSION: Topical therapy with SSO or Aquaphor was highly cost-effective in reducing deaths from infection among the preterm neonates studied. The choice of emollient should be made taking into account budgetary limitations and ease of supply. Further research is warranted on additional locally available emollients, use of emollients in community-based settings and generalizability to other geographic regions.",

The major role for emollients and moisturizers is the supportive role in normalizing hyperproliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis; furthermore, they exert anti-inflammatory effects, for example, through physiologic lipids. Subsequently, an improved barrier function and stratum corneum hydration makes the epidermis more resistant to external stressors and reduces the induction of Koebner phenomena. Most of the emollients are lipid-rich (sometimes oily). The keratolytic agents, especially salicylic acid, and higher concentration of urea should be used in the initial keratolytic phase, whereas moisturizing products and emollients are especially suitable in the intermediate phase and the chronic/remission phase of psoriasis.

Group B used additionally emollients for the whole study period. Patients were evaluated at days 0 (baseline), 7, 14 (end of therapy), 28 and 42 (follow-up). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement of disease severity according to EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) scale (group A: 6.8 +/- 3.59 before and 0.87 +/- 1.25 after therapy, p < 0.001; group B: 9.6 +/- 8.39 before and 1.11 +/- 2.37 after therapy, p < 0.001). Xerosis improved significantly better in group B compared to group A, both clinically (group A: 1.38 +/- 0.57 scores before and 1.5 +/- 0.58 scores after therapy, p = 0.11; group B: 1.62 +/- 0.64 scores before and 0.12 +/- 0.33 scores after therapy, p < 0.001), and by corneometry assessment (group A: 41.7 +/- 9.1 units before and 51.3 +/- 11.3 units after therapy, p < 0.001; group B: 38.9 +/- 12.9 units before and 58.2 +/- 13.5 units after therapy, p < 0.001). A trend towards faster resolving of pruritus in group B (group A: 5.44 +/- 2.6 scores before and 3.22 +/- 2.31 scores after therapy, p = 0.001; group B: 5.87 +/- 2.79 scores before and 2.24 +/- 1.59 scores after therapy, p < 0.001) was also observed. In group B, the improvement was maintained for couple of weeks after treatment discontinuation, while in group A recurrence of the disease was noted (EASI at day 42 in group A vs. group B: 5.29 +/- 5.6 vs. 1.25 +/- 1.4, p = 0.01). Similar results were also observed for xerosis (p < 0.001) and pruritus (p = 0.002). Concomitant usage of emollients significantly improves xerosis and pruritus during corticosteroid treatment of atopic dermatitis and enables to maintain clinical improvement after therapy discontinuation.",

Dry skin has an impact on the patient in terms of discomfort, pruritus and impaired quality of life. Within the overall treatment regimen for these diseases, the use of emollients to manage dry skin plays a considerable role in managing skin conditions. In atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, emollients help to improve skin condition and to reduce pruritus alongside more potent pharmacological agents. It is important to choose an emollient that not only soothes and rehydrates the skin but also offers numerous other dermatological supporting roles, especially induction of proper epidermal differentiation. This review will explain the role of emollients within the management of diseases with dry skin as a major symptom and the components of an ideal emollient.",

The study was carried out to gain insights into oil-massage practices and acceptability of skin barrier-enhancing emollients in young, preterm Bangladeshi neonates. Preterm infants of <33 weeks gestational age were randomized to high-linoleate sunflower seed oil, Aquaphor Original Emollient Ointment, or the comparison group (usual care). A survey was administered at admission to assess routine skin-care practices prior to admission and at discharge to assess acceptability of emollient therapy during hospitalization. Oil massage was given to 83 (21%) of 405 babies before hospital admission, 86% (71/83) of whom were delivered at home. Application of oil, most commonly mustard oil (88%, 73/83), was started within one hour of birth in 51 cases (61%) and was applied all over the body (89%, 74/83) one to six (mean 2.2) times before admission. Of infants who received emollient therapy in the hospital, 42% (n=32) of mothers reported that the emollient applied in the hospital was better than that available at home, and only 29% would use the same oil (i.e. mustard oil) in the future as used previously at home. No problems resulted from use of emollient in the hospital. Topical therapy with sunflower seed oil or Aquaphor was perceived by many families to be superior to mustard oil. If caregivers and health professionals can be motivated to use inexpensive, available emollients, such as sunflower seed oil that are beneficial, emollient therapy could have substantial public-health benefit.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of dampened bandages to reduce inflamed eczema (synonyme dermatitis) is an old remedy. In order to evaluate the current indications for so-called wet-wrap treatment (WWT) for atopic dermatitis (AD), and to compare the different currently recognized methods, a group of experts critically reviewed their own expertise on WWT in respect to the existing literature on the subject. RESULTS: WWT is well tolerated in eczema due to the cooling effect on the skin and the rapid improvement in skin inflammation. It has been shown to be an extremely effective treatment for acute erythrodermic dermatitis, therapy-resistant AD and intolerable pruritus. Advantages of WWT include rapid response to therapy, reduction in itch and sleep disturbance, and potential for reduction in usage of topical corticosteroids (TCS). However, disadvantages include high cost, the necessity for special training in usage, potential for increased TCS absorption, increased cutaneous infections and folliculitis, and poor tolerability. Precautions to reduce the risks of long-term treatment should include education, monitoring of weight and height and, if necessary, serum cortisol levels. In adolescents the risk of striae from TCS absorption around puberty is high, and WWT with TCS in this age group should be used as a short-term therapy only and with extreme caution. To reduce risks, dilutions of steroids may be used ranging from 5 to 10%. In the maintenance phase this treatment can be rotated with the use of emollients only. Low potency TCS should be used on the face (with a mask). CONCLUSION: WWT using diluted steroids is a relatively safe addition to the therapeutic treatment options for children and adults with severe and/or refractory AD. Explanation and education is extremely important in the treatment of AD and WWT should only be employed by practitioners trained in its use. Specialized nursing care is essential, especially when using WWT for prolonged periods.",

Pimecrolimus, an immunosuppressant, was licensed in the U.K. in 2003 as an alternative treatment of mild to moderate atopic eczema. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-utility of pimecrolimus as a treatment for mild and moderate atopic eczema when compared with conventional treatments which use TCS and emollients. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to represent the cyclical nature of atopic eczema and provide an economic analysis of cost-utility for treatment alternatives from the perspective of a third party payer (U.K. National Health Service). A range of methods was used to obtain data for transition probabilities, costs and quality of life. These included a systematic review of published effectiveness data, expert opinion, and a utility study conducted by the authors. Separate cohort analyses were modelled to distinguish between children and adult populations and between differing treatment patterns for facial and body eczema. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (using Monte-Carlo simulation) were performed. RESULTS: Baseline cost-utility outputs from the model show that, in all tested scenarios, TCS dominate pimecrolimus (i.e. TCS are both cheaper and more effective). However, the differences in benefits between treatments output by the model are very small. Sensitivity analyses highlight the importance of cost variations in pimecrolimus. Where pimecrolimus is compared with emollient only it is probably cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30 000 UK pounds per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS: There are likely to be few situations in which the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of atopic eczema can be justified on economic grounds. Exceptions are likely to be in cases where TCS have been shown to be ineffective, unacceptable due to adverse events, or where a patient is unwilling to accept TCS treatment despite appropriate education and support and emollient alone is the alternative clinical option.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with psoriasis undergoing or about to undergo ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy and photochemotherapy often have thick scale on their plaques which can prevent the penetration of UV radiation. Emollients are used to moisturize the skin and to prevent or reduce some of the milder side-effects ('dryness', itching) sometimes experienced during UV therapy. However, emollients can alter the UV transmission of skin and thus may alter the clinical effects of phototherapy and photochemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: We tested 30 of the topical emollients in the British National Formulary (BNF) using a standard in vitro technique used to test sunscreens. We also surveyed U.K. phototherapy units to establish routine practice for emollient use in phototherapy and photochemotherapy. METHODS: We used a standard in vitro technique to measure the monochromatic protection factors (MPFs) of 30 non-bath emollients from the BNF. An application rate of 2 mg cm-2 was used. For the assessment of effects during narrowband UVB (TL-01) phototherapy, the mean of the protection factors at 310 and 315 nm was calculated; for psoralen plus UVA photochemotherapy the mean UVA protection factor was used. A questionnaire survey was used to assess routine practice concerning emollient use prior to phototherapies in phototherapy units throughout the U.K. RESULTS: In the UVA range, 17 of the 30 emollients gave protection factors of 1.2 or above. In the UVB range, 23 of 30 had an MPF of 1.2 or above. Yellow soft paraffin had the highest protection factor in the UVB range. Of 78 centres surveyed, 57 returned completed questionnaires (73%). Seventeen of 57 (30%) centres routinely used emollients immediately prior to administering phototherapy treatments. The remaining 40 of 57 (70%) did not. Forty-five (79%) responding centres recommended the use of emollients after phototherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed considerable variability in the practice of emollient use before phototherapy treatments. Although the majority of centres included in this study did not routinely use emollients, almost one third did. Our in vitro measurement of 30 emollients revealed marked variation in UV transmission, with many emollients blocking sufficient UV to affect the response to therapy.",

In this prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, 35 subjects participated; of them approximately half were atopic (modified Erlanger atopy score > or =8). 2 propanol-based formulations were tested in a repeated open application test, 1 contained a mixture of emollients (0.81%, w/w). 2 aliquots of 0.7 ml of each formulation were applied twice per day over 2 weeks to the cubital fossa of each subject after random assignment of the preparations. Treatment areas were assessed before each application and 3 days postfinal application by visual inspection for erythema and dryness according to a standard scale. The sum score over all assessment time-points served as primary parameter. The mean sum score for erythema and dryness was significantly lower for the hand rub with emollients (0.8 +/- 2.4) in comparison with that for the hand rub without emollients (1.5 +/- 3.5; P = 0.022; Wilcoxon signed rank test). A comparison of the atopic and non-atopic subjects revealed no significant difference for any of the products (P > 0.05; Mann-Whitney U-test). It is concluded that the addition of emollients to a propanol-based hand rub can significantly decrease irritant contact dermatitis under frequent-use conditions.",

The objective of the study was to compare the clinical improvement in psoriasis with PUVA photochemotherapy + topical corticosteroids and PUVA + bland emollients. METHODS: Forty patients with chronic plaque type of psoriasis were divided into two equal groups each having 20 patients. PUVA therapy was given thrice weekly. In addition, patients of group-A were allowed to apply topical betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% diluted 1 into 2 parts with plain vaseline twice daily. Patients of group-B were allowed to apply only plain vaseline over lesions twice daily. Clinical improvement in lesions was observed by decrease in the severity of erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. RESULTS: Clearance of psoriasis was achieved in 95%, of the patients treated with PUVA plus topical corticosteroids while clearance was achieved in 80% of patients treated with PUVA plus bland emollients (P = 0.0758). Median numbers of exposures for group-A were 16 & for group-B were 17.5 (p = 0.1029). Similarly, median cumulative dose in group-A was 64.5 J/cm2 & in group-B was 70.7 J/cm2 (p = 0.372). CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in clinical improvement in psoriasis treated either by PUVA plus topical steroids or PUVA plus bland emollients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infections and complications of prematurity are main causes of neonatal mortality. Very low birthweight premature infants have compromised skin barrier function, and are at especially high risk for serious infections and mortality. Our aim was to ascertain whether topical application of emollients to enhance skin barrier function would prevent nosocomial infections in this population. METHODS: We randomly assigned infants born before week 33 of gestation after admission to Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Bangladesh, to daily massage with sunflower seed oil (n=159) or Aquaphor (petrolatum, mineral oil, mineral wax, lanolin alcohol; n=157). We then compared incidence of nosocomial infections among infants in these two groups with an untreated control group (n=181) by an intention-to-treat analysis. FINDINGS: 20 patients in the control group, and 22 in each of the treatment groups left the hospital early, but were included in the final analysis. Overall, infants treated with sunflower seed oil were 41% less likely to develop nosocomial infections than controls (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.96, p=0.032). Aquaphor did not significantly reduce the risk of infection (0.60, 0.35-1.03, p=0.065). No adverse events were seen. INTERPRETATION: Our findings confirm that skin application of sunflower seed oil provides protection against nosocomial infections in preterm very low birthweight infants. The low cost, availability, simplicity, and effect of treatment make it an important intervention for very low birthweight infants admitted to hospital in developing countries.",

      "abstract": "Emollients and moisturizing creams are used to break the dry skin cycle and to maintain the smoothness of the skin. The term 'moisturizer' is often used synonymously with emollient, but moisturizers often contain humectants in order to hydrate the stratum corneum. Dryness is frequently linked to an impaired barrier function observed, for example, in atopic skin, psoriasis, ichthyosis, and contact dermatitis. Dryness and skin barrier disorders are not a single entity, but are characterized by differences in chemistry and morphology in the epidermis. Large differences also exist between moisturizing creams. Moisturizers have multiple functions apart from moistening the skin. Similar to other actives, the efficacy is likely to depend on the dosage, where compliance is a great challenge faced in the management of skin diseases. Strong odor from ingredients and greasy compositions may be disagreeable to the patients. Furthermore, low pH and sensory reactions, from lactic acid and urea for example, may reduce patient acceptance. Once applied to the skin, the ingredients can stay on the surface, be absorbed into the skin, be metabolized, or disappear from the surface by evaporation, sloughing off, or by contact with other materials. In addition to substances considered as actives, e.g. fats and humectants, moisturizers contain substances conventionally considered as excipients (e.g. emulsifiers, antioxidants, preservatives). Recent findings indicate that actives and excipients may have more pronounced effects in the skin than previously considered. Some formulations may deteriorate the skin condition, whereas others improve the clinical appearance and skin barrier function. For example, emulsifiers may weaken the barrier. On the other hand, petrolatum has an immediate barrier-repairing effect in delipidized stratum corneum. Moreover, one ceramide-dominant lipid mixture improved atopic dermatitis and decreased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in an open-label study in children. In double-blind studies moisturizers with urea have been shown to reduce TEWL in atopic and ichthyotic patients. Urea also makes normal and atopic skin less susceptible against irritation to sodium laurilsulfate. Treatments improving the barrier function may reduce the likelihood of further aggravation of the disease. In order to have optimum effect it is conceivable that moisturizers should be tailored with respect to the epidermal abnormality. New biochemical approaches and non-invasive instruments will increase our understanding of skin barrier disorders and facilitate optimum treatments. The chemistry and function of dry skin and moisturizers is a challenging subject for the practicing dermatologist, as well as for the chemist developing these agents in the pharmaceutical/cosmetic industry.",

      "abstract": "Emollients are agents designed to make the stratum corneum softer and more plant by increasing its hydration. A large number of preparations are available today, many of which are marketed as cosmetic and therapeutic moisturizers. They are the most prescribed products in dermatology. Their structure and function are surprisingly complex and sophisticated, and many are equidistant between cosmetics and drugs. The use of the emollients corrects the problems in scaling disorders. It is well known that the electrical properties of the stratum corneum change after application of an emollient. It is also possible that they have suppressive effects on epidermal thickening. Emollients have an anti-inflammatory activity and also give some transient relief from irritation. In clinical use emollients are employed as treatments for ichthyoses, xeroderma and disorders of keratinization, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and photodamaged skin. Emollients of the new millennium include agents that mimic natural ingredients and function as botanicals, including vitamins, hydroxy acids, and retinoids. Emollients can cause a few side effects, such as irritant dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, fragrance allergy or allergy to other constituents (preservatives or additives), stinging, cosmetic acne, and pigmentary disorders. We can conclude that emollients, continuously evolving to ever more sophisticated products, are very important in the treatment of different dermatoses.",

Publications on real intervention studies of barrier creams or emollients in a workplace setting are scarce: only four such studies could be identified. The relatively short follow-up of most studies, and the small numbers of subjects enrolled, may reflect the organisational complexity of such studies. The observed effect is a combination of the intervention effect to be measured, and a number of disturbing variables. These disturbing variables are not just measurement error, but also phenomena such as the course of the disease, confounding and effect modification. In hand-eczema studies, the outcome parameters that should form the basis of the intervention effect are ill defined. Moreover, the study itself (i.e. the investigators) influences the results because there is rarely a single intervention: unknowingly, there are improvements in glove wearing, hand-washing habits or occupational hygiene in general. The performance of a blind study is often difficult or impossible. Large numbers of subjects have to be enrolled if a meaningful reduction in incidence of hand eczema is to be detected. One can demonstrate this by calculating the required enrollment in a study among employees in a nursing home.",

The report stated that 'expert patients' could become 'sharers in their care' and are best placed to improve their own self management. One area that could benefit greatly from increased patient education and participation is the use of emollients. Emollients are frequently prescribed for patients with eczema and other dry skin conditions. Although the benefits of emollient therapy are widely accepted, prescribing practices vary considerably, often according to physicians' individual preferences. Patients can receive confusing or conflicting treatment advice, leading to frustration, non-compliance, and difficulty in following an effective regimen. To promote the effective use of emollients it is important for patients and health professionals to understand the functions of the skin and the principles of emollient use and application. We propose a set of simple guidelines for emollient therapy in eczema care to improve day-to-day management by health professionals in the community and to promote consistent practices by patients. These guidelines form the ABC dry skin and eczema management programme supported by the National Eczema Society and accredited by the British Skin Foundation.",

This can be one of the pathogenic processes implicated in atopic dermatitis (AD). Several studies have assessed the value of essential fatty acid-enriched diets in AD but the benefits of topical γ-lino-lenic acid (GLA) therapy have been less well evaluated. The aims of this study were: a) to compare the effects of GLA-con-taining emollients and classical emollients, regarding clinical benefits, cutaneous hydration (by a conductance method) and TEWL; b) to assess the clinical relevance of these two biomet-rical methods (conductance and TEWL). METHODS: Twenty-three AD children were randomised into four groups, to compare three emollients containing GLA in different concentrations and one classical emollient. They were evaluated in eight visits for 12 weeks, using a clinical score and measurements of TEWL with the Tewameter™ and of cutaneous hydration with the Nova™. RESULTS: Kruskal-Wallis statistical analysis showed significant differences in cutaneous hydration (P<0.05) between each of the three treatment groups and the control group. TEWL and clinical scores did not show statistically significant differences. During the study no children from the GLA groups developed eczematous lesions versus two children from the non-GLA group. CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies between conductance and TEWL measurements may represent false positive results of the former method due to electrical phenomena related to polarity of the GLA molecule or of other elements in the formulations. However, some differences in clinical evolution between the GLA and non-GLA groups require further studies to assess the possible additional benefits of topical emollients containing GLA."

Blisters can compromise performance, so it is important to devise preventive strategies to reduce these injuries. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the influence of an antiperspirant with emollient additives on frequency and severity of friction blisters, hot spots, and irritant dermatitis. METHODS: Twenty-three healthy men walked on a treadmill (1.39 m/sec, 1% grade) in a warm environment (28 degrees C, 25% relative humidity) carrying a total mass of 21 +/- 1 kg. For 4 consecutive days before the walk, the subjects' feet were treated with either (1) an antiperspirant (20% aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycine concentration plus water) with emollient additives, (2) emollient additives alone (placebo control), or (3) nothing (nontreated). In two separate trials (1 month apart) each participant received the antiperspirant treatment and both control treatments (emollient [placebo] and no treatment). RESULTS: No differences were seen among treatment conditions for sweat accumulation (p = 0.86), blister incidence (p = 0.36), hot spot incidence (p = 0.83), or blister severity (p = 0.31). Irritant dermatitis was not reported in any of the treatment conditions. CONCLUSION: The use of an antiperspirant with emollients reduces irritant dermatitis but does not reduce total foot-sweat accumulation, blister or hot spot incidence, or blister severity.",

Fewer products, 25% at 2 microliters/cm2 and 50% at 4 microliters/cm2, had a psoralen erythema protection factor > 1.2. A protection factor of 1.2 is equivalent to a reduction in ultraviolet dose of 17%, and is thus likely to be of clinical importance. These results allow a choice of emollient products which may improve response by increasing transmission of radiation through psoriasis scale without a concomitant decrease in transmission due to a sunscreening action.",

Twice daily application of betamethasone dipropionate cream and once daily application of both betamethasone dipropionate cream and either a water-in-oil based moisturizing cream or lotion were equivalent in efficacy (p = 0.05). Once daily application of both betamethasone dipropionate cream and either a water-in-oil based cream or lotion was significantly better than once daily application of betamethasone dipropionate cream alone (p = 0.05). Water-in-oil emollients are useful in the therapy of chronic, plaque-type psoriasis and provide a steroid-sparing effect.",

In a subsequent therapeutic study involving 144 trainee hairdressers who had marked chronic toxic contact eczema, it was shown that regular use of pH-stabilized creams and ointments and use of non-alkaline soaps are effective and the use of cortisone ointments should not be necessary. It was demonstrated that 70% of the probands showed clear improvement in eczematous changes as controlled by colour changes in the nitrazine yellow test. However, 30% of those investigated were not thought to be able to continue as hairdressers. These results enable early detection of persons in whom a change of occupation seems indicated. Furthermore, treatment of young persons permits maximal curative changes and represents a model of preventive medicine in dermatology.",

Planter's Peanut Oil (Standard Brands) and Mazola Corn Oil (Best Foods Inc) had no effect; Alpha Keri Bath Oil (Westwood Pharmaceuticals), mineral oil, and Johnson's Baby Oil (Johnson & Johnson Co) had minimal effects. Vaseline Petroleum Jelly (Chesebrough-Ponds Inc), petrolatum, and hydrophilic ointment substantially reduced the erythema that was induced by exposure to low doses of UVB radiation. Therefore, these emollients may interfere with the therapeutic effects of the ultraviolet radiation component of the Goeckerman treatment when it is administered in low doses to patients with psoriasis.",
