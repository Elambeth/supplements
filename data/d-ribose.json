      "abstract": "D-Ribose-L-Cysteine (Riboceine)- an antioxidant supplement that may help to raise the glutathione levels by acting as a precursor for glutathione biosynthesis in biological systems. Effect of riboceine (Rb) on sodium arsenite (SA) induced hepatorenal toxicity was investigated in rats. Four groups (A-D) (six per group) were treated thus: Group A (water and normal diet only); while Group B (SA at 5 mg/kg body weight); Group C (riboceine at 10 mg/kg body weight) and Group D (riboceine and SA). The exposure to test substances lasted for a total of 14 days in each case in which pre-treatment was done with riboceine. Exposure to SA triggered a significant reduction in the entire weight and relative organ weight, increase in ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALP (alkaline phosphatase) activities, decrease in liver total protein and increase in serum levels of urea and creatinine. Furthermore, SA caused a significant reduction in GSH (glutathione) level and CAT (Catalase) activity, while the LPO (lipid peroxidation) and NO (nitric oxide) levels were significantly increased. Pre-treatment with riboceine, restored the levels of the aforementioned parameters. Riboceine also promote restoration of hepatocytes and renal cells integrity. Findings from this study reaffirm the hepatorenal toxicities of sodium arsenite and show the protective role of riboceine against SA-induced toxicities. Protective effects of riboceine may be via the enhancement of the level of glutathione, a natural scavenger of free radicals.",

      "abstract": "Many wounds can be challenging to manage because of pain and poor angiogenesis. An ideal treatment for such wounds would be a gel that can induce angiogenesis to accelerate wound healing and to reduce pain. Our aim in this study was to explore combining 2-deoxy-d-ribose (2dDR) to induce angiogenesis with lidocaine hydrochloride to reduce pain in the form of a tube-based gel. Gels were synthesized with a fixed concentration of 2dDR as established in prior studies and we explored several concentrations of lidocaine hydrochloride. Simultaneous release of 2dDR and lidocaine was then assessed from all gels. A gel with 9.9 % w/w lidocaine gel showed good release and was selected for further studies. The gel was sterilized by heating at 90 °C for 20 min and post-sterilization drug release analysis was performed to confirm that sterilization did not affect this. The performance of the gel was then assessed in a full-thickness rat wound model to assess pain relief and wound healing potential. Results showed that the treatment of animals with this gel reduced the pain from a pain score of 2 to 0 after 2 h of application as compared to 2 to 1.5 in the control group. The gel also showed an 86 % wound closure as compared to the control group which achieved 58 % wound closure in 14 days. We suggest that this hydrogel is a potential therapeutic solution to induce angiogenesis for accelerating wound healing and to reduce pain. This could have applications in a range of wounds from superficial grazes through to bed sores.",

      "abstract": "Androgenic alopecia (AGA) affects both men and women worldwide. New blood vessel formation can restore blood supply and stimulate the hair regrowth cycle. Recently, our group reported that 2-deoxy-D-ribose (2dDR) is 80%-90% as effective as VEGF in the stimulation of neovascularization in in vitro models and in a chick bioassay. In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of 2dDR on hair growth. We prepared an alginate gel containing 2dDR, polypropylene glycol, and phenoxyethanol. AGA was developed in C57BL6 mice by intraperitoneally injecting testosterone (TE). A dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated group was used as a negative control, a minoxidil group was used as a positive control, and we included groups treated with 2dDR gel and a combination of 2dDR and minoxidil. Each treatment was applied for 20 days. Both groups treated with 2dDR gel and minoxidil stimulated the morphogenesis of hair follicles. H&E-stained skin sections of C57BL/6 mice demonstrated an increase in length, diameter, hair follicle density, anagen/telogen ratio, diameter of hair follicles, area of the hair bulb covered in melanin, and an increase in the number of blood vessels. Masson's trichrome staining showed an increase in the area of the hair bulb covered in melanin. The effects of the FDA-approved drug (minoxidil) on hair growth were similar to those of 2dDR (80%-90%). No significant benefit were observed by applying a combination of minoxidil with 2dDR. We conclude that 2dDR gel has potential for the treatment of androgenic alopecia and possibly other alopecia conditions where stimulation of hair regrowth is desirable, such as after chemotherapy. The mechanism of activity of 2dDR remains to be established."

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Recent findings suggest that inhibiting system χc-induces ferroptosis by reducing intracellular cystine levels, and that ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI) and diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, 2-deoxy-d-ribose (dRib) has been shown to inhibit cystine uptake through xCT, the functional unit of system χc-, in β-cells. This study aimed to investigate if dRib induces ferroptosis in RTECs and identify the underlying mechanisms. dRib treatment reduced cystine uptake and glutathione (GSH) content, and increased intracellular levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell death in both NRK-52E cells and primary cultured RTECs. However, treatment with inhibitors of ferroptosis, such as deferoxamine (DFO), ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), and liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), counteracted the effects of dRib on GSH, MDA, 4-HNE, and lipid ROS levels, as well as cell death. Additionally, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) treatment or xCT gene overexpression protected against dRib-induced changes. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed dRib-induced mitochondrial shrinkage, decrease in cristae number, and outer membrane rupture. Furthermore, dRib treatment upregulated the expression of genes associated with ferroptosis, and downregulated xCT protein expression. The decrease in xCT protein caused by dRib was consistently observed even when treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. However, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed the dRib-induced decrease in xCT protein expression. Additionally, dRib increased xCT protein ubiquitination. Overall, dRib induces ferroptosis in RTECs by degrading xCT protein through ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), resulting in reduced intracellular cystine uptake. Therefore, targeting the regulation of system χc-through UPS could be a potential therapeutic approach for AKI and diabetic nephropathy.",

      "abstract": "Developing multifunctional wound dressings capable of inducing rapid angiogenesis and with antibacterial activity would be attractive for diabetic and superficial wound healing. Hydrogels delivered from tubes have several desirable features -they are easy to apply, keep the wound moist, reduce the entry of microorganisms and avoid the need for painful dressing removal. Previously we reported that 2 deoxy-D-ribose (2dDR) delivered from a variety of dressings is capable of promoting wound healing by stimulating angiogenesis. Alginate hydrogels are an ideal vehicle to deliver a bioactive agent capable of promoting wound healing. In this study we developed and evaluated a tube hydrogel capable of delivering 2dDR with the aim of achieving a stable, convenient to administer and biologically effective wound treatment. Further, we included the stabilizer 2-phenoxy ethanol which provided antimicrobial activity. We synthesized hydrogels by the Green method, using simple mixing of sodium alginate, propylene glycol, 2-phenoxy ethanol and 2dDR in water. FTIR (Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy) analysis confirmed an absence of undesirable chemical changes in the gel components, and SEM images of the freeze-dried gels showed porous structures. When 2dDR alginate gel (2dDR-SA hydrogel) was placed in PBS at 37°C, almost 92% of 2dDR was released within 7 days. When tested on cultured cells, 2dDR-SA hydrogels did not inhibit metabolic activity or proliferation, achieving up to 90 and 98% of control respectively over 7 days. 2dDR-SA hydrogel also showed anti-bacterial activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and MRSA which was attributable to the stabilizer 2-phenoxy ethanol in the hydrogel. Stimulation of angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay by 2dDR-SA hydrogel was found to be significant compared to the blank-SA. Wound healing potential was studied in full-thickness wounds in rats where acceleration of wound healing was seen. H&E staining of the wound tissue showed an enhanced number of blood vessels and re-epithelization, and a reduced number of inflammatory cells in 2dDR-SA treated animals compared to blank-hydrogels while Masson's trichrome staining showed increased collagen deposition. In summary we describe a convenient to apply hydrogel which has promise for use in a range of superficial skin wounds including applications in chronic wound care.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered an early event of Alzheimer disease (AD). D-ribose is a natural monosaccharide that exists in cells, especially in mitochondria, and can lead to cognitive dysfunction. However, the reason for this is unclear. Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid that can target mitochondria and has great prospect in the treatment of AD. The methylation of PINK1 reinforces the burden of Alzheimer's pathology. This study explores the role of BBR and D-ribose in the mitophagy and cognitive function of AD related to DNA methylation. APP/PS1 mice and N2a cells were treated with D-ribose, BBR, and mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 to observe their effects on mitochondrial morphology, mitophagy, neuron histology, AD pathology, animal behavior, and PINK1 methylation. The results showed that D-ribose induced mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy damage, and cognitive impairment. However, BBR inhibition of PINK1 promoter methylation can reverse the above effects caused by D-ribose, improve mitochondrial function, and restore mitophagy through the PINK1-Parkin pathway, thus reducing cognitive deficits and the burden of AD pathology. This experiment puts a new light on the mechanism of action of D-ribose in cognitive impairment and reveals new insights in the use of BBR for AD treatment.",

      "abstract": "d-Ribose is not only an important component of some biomacromolecules, but also an active pentose with strong reducibility and non-enzymatic glycation ability. Previous studies reported the diverse role of d-ribose in different cells. In this study, the effects of d-ribose on non-enzymatic glycation of hemoglobin (Hb), as well as eryptosis, oxidative stress and energy metabolism of erythrocytes were observed by molecular fluorescence spectrophotometry, multi-wavelength spectrophotometry, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry (MS) and flow cytometer. The results showed that d-ribose had the strongest non-enzymatic glycation ability to Hb in vitro when compared with other monosaccharides, and could enter the erythrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, which was not inhibited by the specific glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) inhibitor WZB117. In addition, d-ribose incubation increased the HbA1c, hemolysis, eryptosis, and ROS level of erythrocytes significantly more than that of d-glucose, however, no changes were observed in the levels of ATP, NADPH, and other intermediate energy metabolites in d-ribose treatment. Therefore, the strong non-enzymatic glycation ability of d-ribose may play an important role in erythrocyte damage.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Glycation and oxidative stress are the major contributing factors responsible for diabetes and its secondary complications. Aminoguanidine, a hydrazine derivative, is the only approved drug that reduces glycation with its known side effects. As a result, research into medicinal plants with antioxidant and antiglycation properties is beneficial in treating diabetes and its consequences. This investigation aimed to examine the efficacy of the aqueous extract of Nigella sativa seeds against the D-ribose-induced glycation system. Materials and Methods: The suppression of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes were used to assess the antidiabetic capacity. UV-Visible, fluorescence, and FTIR spectroscopy were used to characterize the Nigella sativa seed extract and its efficacy in preventing glycation. The inhibition of albumin glycation, fluorescent advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation, thiol oxidation, and amyloid formation were used to evaluate the extracts' antiglycation activity. In addition, the extent of glycoxidative DNA damage was analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: The IC50 for the extract in the α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition assays were approximately 1.39 ± 0.016 and 1.01 ± 0.022 mg/mL, respectively. Throughout the investigation, it was found that the aqueous extract of Nigella sativa seeds (NSAE) inhibited the level of ketoamine, exerted a considerable drop in fluorescence intensity, and reduced carbonyl production and thiol modification when added to the D-ribose-induced glycation system. In addition, a reduction in the BSA-cross amyloid formation was seen in the Congo red, thioflavin T assay, and electrophoretic techniques. NSAE also exhibited a strong capability for DNA damage protection. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Nigella sativa could be used as a natural antidiabetic, antiglycation treatment and a cost-effective and environmentally friendly source of powerful bioactive chemicals.",

M. tuberculosis is also referred as Koch's bacillus as it was first defined by Robert Koch in 1821. In the entire history of M. tuberculosis infection, several different targets were identified and explored with a hope of effective therapeutic treatment against tuberculosis. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is the major obstacle for researchers and letting them fail continuously to discover new drug candidates. Among the numerous antitubercular targets, Decaprenyl-phosphoryl-β-D-ribose-2'-epimerase (DprE1) is novel target identified in the year 2009. The present article portrays insights of DprE1 enzyme in all the aspects i.e., identification, structural elucidation to designing strategies and synthesis of potential drug candidates to combat resistant strains. Along with the synthesis and biological activity of novel compounds, structure-activity relationship (SAR) data is given to help medicinal chemists and researchers working in this area for the development of new inhibitors to fight against M. tuberculosis. DprE1 is new ray of hope for antitubercular treatment. No single drug candidate (DprE1 inhibitor) has passed clinical trial yet and hence it nullifies the risk of development of resistance or mutations at specific residues. Researchers working in this area have to design and come up with new potent candidates with less dose, no toxicity to combat this deadly infection. This review emphasized on year wise systematic development and progress of DprE1 inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: D-ribose is an aldehyde sugar and a necessary component of all living cells. Numerous reports have focused on D-ribose intervention in animal models to assess the negative effects of D-ribose on cognition. However, the results across these studies are inconsistent and the doses and actual effects of D-ribose on cognition remain unclear. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of D-ribose on cognition in rodents. METHODS: The articles from PubMed, Embase, Sciverse Scopus, Web of Science, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, SinoMed, Wanfang, and Cqvip databases were screened. The results from the abstract on cognitive-related behavioral tests and biochemical markers from the included articles were extracted and the reporting quality was assessed. RESULTS: A total of eight trials involving 289 rodents met the eligibility criteria, and both low- and high-dose groups were included. Meta-analyses of these studies showed that D-ribose could cause a significant decrease in the number of platform crossings (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.80; 95% CI: -1.14, -0.46; p < 0.00001), percentage of distance traversed in the target quadrant (SMD: -1.20; 95% CI: -1.47, -0.92; p < 0.00001), percentage of time spent in the target quadrant (SMD: -0.93; 95% CI: -1.18, -0.68; p < 0.00001), and prolonged escape latency (SMD: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.65; p = 0.001) in the Morris water maze test. Moreover, D-ribose intervention increased the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the brain (SMD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.63; p < 0.00001) and blood (SMD: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.92; p = 0.02). Subsequently, subgroup analysis for the dose of D-ribose intervention revealed that high doses injured cognitive function more significantly than low D-ribose doses. CONCLUSION: D-ribose treatment caused cognitive impairment, and cognition deteriorated with increasing dose. Furthermore, the increase in AGEs in the blood and brain confirmed that D-ribose may be involved in cognitive impairment through non-enzymatic glycosylation resulting in the generation of AGEs. These findings provide a new research idea for unveiling basic mechanisms and prospective therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of patients with cognitive impairment."

      "abstract": "The metabolic microenvironment of bacteria impacts drug efficacy. However, the metabolic mechanisms of drug-resistant Salmonella spp. remain largely unknown. This study characterized the metabolic mechanism of gentamicin-resistant Salmonella Choleraesuis and found that D-ribose increased the gentamicin-mediated killing of this bacteria. Non-targeted metabolomics of homologous gentamicin-susceptible Salmonella Choleraesuis (SCH-S) and gentamicin-resistant S. Choleraesuis (SCH-R) was performed using UHPLC-Q-TOF MS. The metabolic signature of SCH-R included disrupted central carbon metabolism and energy metabolism, along with dysregulated amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, vitamin and cofactor metabolism, and fatty acid synthesis. D-ribose, the most suppressed metabolite in SCH-R, was shown to strengthen gentamicin efficacy against SCH-R and a clinically isolated multidrug-resistant strain. This metabolite had a similar impact on Salmonella. Derby and Salmonella. Typhimurium. D-ribose activates central carbon metabolism including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), increases the abundance of NADH, polarizes the electron transport chain (ETC), and elevates the proton motive force (PMF) of cells, and induces drug uptake and cell death. These findings suggest that central carbon metabolism plays a critical role in the acquisition of gentamicin resistance by Salmonella, and that D-ribose may serve as an antibiotic adjuvant for gentamicin treatment of resistant bacterial infections."

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a member of halogenated aromatic environmental pollutants with diverse environmental matrices. This study was conducted to explore the mechanisms of PCBs-induced testicular maladaptive responses and the potential reversal effects of d-ribose- l-cysteine (DRLC) on testicular injury induced by administration of PCBs (2 mg/kg) for 30 days. DRLC (50 mg/kg) was administered orally for 15 days starting from Days 16 to 30 after the initial 15 days of treatment with PCB. All assays were carried out using established protocols. Administration of DRLC at 50 mg/kg after treatment with PCBs enhances body and testicular weights, gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), testosterone and poor sperm quality. DRLC also reduced testicular injury score, improved spermatogenesis scoring, reduced oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde), as well as restored the reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) and decreases pro-inflammatory response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and NO). More so, DRLC treatment abrogates testicular DNA fragmentation and downregulated p53 and caspase 3 activities and upregulated the concentration of autophagy-related protein (mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] and Atg7).

The overall objective of this study was to determine if ubiquinol and/or d-ribose would reduce the symptoms and improve cardiac performance in patients with HFpEF. This was a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 216 patients with HFpEF who were ≥ 50 years old with a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 50%. A total of 4 study groups received various supplements over 12 weeks: Group 1 received placebo ubiquinol capsules and d-ribose powder, Group 2 received ubiquinol capsules (600 mg/d) and placebo d-ribose powder, Group 3 received placebo ubiquinol capsules with d-ribose powder (15 g/d), and Group 4 received ubiquinol capsules and d-ribose powder. There were 7 outcome measures for this study: Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) clinical summary score, level of vigor using a subscale from the Profile of Mood States, EF, the ratio of mitral peak velocity of early filling to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (septal E/e' ratio), B-type natriuretic peptides, lactate/adenosine triphosphate ratio, and the 6-minute walk test. Treatment with ubiquinol and/or d-ribose significantly improved the KCCQ clinical summary score (17.30 to 25.82 points), vigor score (7.65 to 8.15 points), and EF (7.08% to 8.03%) and reduced B-type natriuretic peptides (-72.02 to -47.51) and lactate/adenosine triphosphate ratio (-4.32 to -3.35 × 10-4). There were no significant increases in the septal E/e' or the 6-minute walk test. In conclusion, ubiquinol and d-ribose reduced the symptoms of HFpEF and increased the EF. These findings support the use of these supplements in addition to standard therapeutic treatments for patients with HFpEF.",

In the present study, we examined the effects of RibCys on weight changes, cognitive and motor associated activities, oxidative stress markers, striatal and cortical histology, and microglia activation following Mn exposure. Rats were exposed to either saline, Mn or/and RibCys for two weeks. The Mn exposed rats received RibCys either as pre-, co-, or post-treatments. Mn caused a significant decrease in weight, memory and motor activities, increased lactate dehydrogenase level, overexpression of IBA1 reflecting microglia activation, and distortion of the neuronal cytoarchitecture of the striatum and motor cortex, respectively. Interventions with RibCys mitigated Mn-induced neurotoxic events.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this review article, we briefly describe the status of treatment options for HFpEF and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of HFpEF as an alternative therapeutic target. We also examine the mechanisms of D-ribose in cellular energy production and discuss the potential disadvantages and benefits of supplemental use of D-ribose in patients with HFpEF. BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a major cardiovascular disease that impacts over 6 million Americans and is one of the leading causes for morbidity and mortality. Patients with heart failure often experience shortness of breath and fatigue along with impaired physical capacity, all leading to poor quality of life. As a subtype of heart failure, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized with impaired diastolic function. Currently, there are no effective treatments specifically for HFpEF, thus clinicians and researchers are searching for therapies to improve cardiac function. Emerging evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired cardiac bioenergetics are among the underlying mechanisms for HFpEF. There is increased interest in investigating the use of supplements such as D-ribose to enhance mitochondrial function and improve production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). METHODS: For this narrative review, more than 100 relevant scientific articles were considered from various databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Google Scholar) using the keywords \"Heart Failure\", \"HFpEF\", \"D-ribose\", \"ATP\", \"Mitochondria\", Bioenergetics\", and \"Cellular Respiration\". CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to find potential targeted therapeutic treatments for HFpEF. Since there is evidence that the HFpEF is related to impaired myocardial bioenergetics, enhancing mitochondrial function could augment cardiac function. Using a supplement such as D-ribose could improve mitochondrial function by increasing ATP and enhancing cardiac performance for patients with HFpEF. There is a recently completed clinical trial with HFpEF patients that indicates D-ribose increases ATP production and improves cardiac ejection fraction."

D-Ribose-l-Cysteine (DRLC) is an active ingredient of riboceine, help cells to produce glutathione on body demand. AIM: Current study focused on ameliorating potential and fertility enhancing activities of D-Ribose-l-Cysteine in cisplatin induced oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and seminiferous epithelium degeneration. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty (60) male rats randomized into six groups of ten (n = 10) rats each. Group A (control) received 2.0 ml distilled water, group B received single dose of 8 mg/kg bwt CN, group C received 30 mg/kg bwt DRLC, group D received single dose of 8 mg/kg CN follow by 30 mg/kg bwt DRLC, group E received single dose of 8 mg/kg CN and vitamin C, group F received single dose of 8 mg/kg cisplatin follow by DRLC + Vit.C for 56 days. Parameters tested include: Sperm parameters, testosterone (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating Hormone, (FSH), Prolactin, and testicular 17β-HSD activity, Blood hydroperoxide (BHP), Malondialdehyde (MDA), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Glutathione (GSH) and Catalase (CAT), testicular histology and fertility test. RESULTS: Cisplatin significantly reduced testicular volume, body weight, sperm quality, fertility indices, TT, FSH, LH, 17β-HSD, SOD, GSH, CAT, diameter and cross-sectional area of seminiferous tubules, spermatogenesis score. And elevate prolactin, testicular injury score, BHP and MDA compared with control group. Cisplatin only treated rats showed degenerated seminiferous epithelium with empty lumen. Intervention of D-Ribose-Cysteine ameliorated toxic impacts of CN on testis and improved the male fertility. CONCLUSION: D-Ribose-l-Cysteine therefore, preserves testicular integrity and functions thereby, preventing the deleterious impact of CN."

      "abstract": "Cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) is one of the main determinants of in vivo activity and potency. A significant advancement in improving uptake into cells has come through the conjugation of ASOs to triantenarry N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc3), a ligand for the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes. The impact for antisense oligonucleotides, which are already taken up into hepatocytes, is a 10-fold improvement in potency in mice and up to a 30-fold potency improvement in humans, resulting in overall lower effective dose and exposure levels. 2'-Methoxyethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotide conjugated to GalNAc3 (ISIS 702843) is specific for human transmembrane protease serine 6 and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of β-thalassemia. This report summarizes a chronic toxicity study of ISIS 702843 in nonhuman primates (NHPs), including pharmacokinetic and pharmacology assessments. Suprapharmacologic doses of ISIS 702843 were well tolerated in NHPs after chronic dosing, and the data indicate that the overall safety profile is very similar to that of the unconjugated 2'-(2-methoxyethyl)-D-ribose (2'-MOE) ASOs. Notably, the GalNAc3 moiety did not cause any new toxicities nor exacerbate the known nonspecific class effects of the 2'-MOE ASOs. This observation was confirmed with multiple GalNAc3-MOE conjugates by querying a data base of monkey studies containing both GalNAc3-conjugated and unconjugated 2'-MOE ASOs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This report documents the potency, pharmacology, and overall tolerability profile of a triantenarry N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc3)-conjugated 2'-(2-methoxyethyl)-D-ribose (2'-MOE) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) specific to transmembrane protease serine 6 after chronic treatment in the cynomolgus monkey. Collective analysis of 15 independent GalNAc3-conjugated and unconjugated 2'-MOE ASOs shows the consistency in the dose response and character of hepatic and platelet tolerability across sequences that will result in much larger safety margins for the GalNAc3-conjugated 2'-MOE ASOs when compared with the unconjugated 2'-MOE ASOs given the increased potency.",

D-Ribose-L-Cysteine (DRLC) is a powerful antioxidant with neuroprotective properties. This study explored the antioxidant response of DRLC against cuprizone-induced behavioral alterations, biochemical imbalance and hippocampal neuronal damage in adult wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty two (32) adult male wistar rats (150-200g) were divided into four groups (n = 8). Group A received normal saline only as placebo; Group B received 0.5% cuprizone diet only; Group C received a combination of 0.5% cuprizone diet and 100 mg/kg bw of DRLC and Group D received 100 mg/kg bw of DRLC only. The administration was done through oral gavage once daily for 45 days. After the last treatment, neurobehavioral tests (Morris Water Maze and Y maze) was conducted; animals sacrificed and brain harvested for histological analysis and biochemical estimations of levels of antioxidants, oxidative stress markers, neurotransmitters and enzyme activitties. RESULTS: The results showed significant memory decline, hippocampal alterations, decrease levels of antioxidant markers, enzyme and neurotransmitters activities with concomitant increase in norepinephrine and oxidative stress markers in cuprizone induced rats relative to normal but was attenuated with DRLC administration. CONCLUSION: Cuprizone causes cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration through oxidative stress; however, administration of DRLC ameliorated neuropathological alteration induced by cuprizone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Delayed neovascularisation of tissue-engineered (TE) complex constructs is a major challenge that causes their failure post-implantation. Although significant progress has been made in the field of angiogenesis, ensuring rapid neovascularisation still remains a challenge. The use of pro-angiogenic agents is an effective approach to promote angiogenesis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been widely studied both at the biological and molecular levels and is recognised as a key stimulator of angiogenesis. However, the exogenous use of VEGF in an uncontrolled manner has been shown to result in leaky, permeable and haemorrhagic vessels. Thus, researchers have been actively seeking alternative agents to upregulate VEGF production rather than exogenous use of VEGF in TE systems. We have previously revealed the potential of 2-deoxy-d-ribose (2dDR) as an alternative pro-angiogenic agent to induce angiogenesis and accelerates wound healing. However, to date, there is not any clear evidence on whether 2dDR influences the angiogenic cascade that involves VEGF. METHODS: In this study, we explored the angiogenic properties of 2dDR either by its direct application to human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) or when released from commercially available alginate dressings and demonstrated that when 2dDR promotes angiogenesis, it also increases the VEGF production of HAECs. RESULTS: The VEGF quantification results suggested that VEGF production by HAECs was increased with 2dDR treatment but not with other sugars, including 2-deoxy-l-ribose (2dLR) and d-glucose (DG). The stability studies demonstrated that approximately 40-50% of the 2dDR had disappeared in the media over 14 days, either in the presence or absence of HAECs, and the reduction was higher when cells were present. The concentration of VEGF in the media also fell after day 4 associated with the reduction in 2dDR. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that 2dDR (but not other sugars tested in this study) stimulates angiogenesis by increasing the production of VEGF. We conclude 2dDR appears to be a practical and effective indirect route to upregulating VEGF for several days, leading to increased angiogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Pancreatic β-cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress, which promotes β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes. System χc- is a sodium-independent, cystine/glutamate antiporter that mediates the exchange of extracellular l-cystine and intracellular l-glutamate. The import of l-cystine through this transporter is the rate-limiting step in the glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis pathway that plays a significant role in antioxidative defense. Previously, we reported that 2-deoxy-d-ribose (dRib) induces oxidative damage through GSH depletion in pancreatic β-cells. In the current study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying the oxidative stress-induced β-cell damage. We measured the intracellular l-[14C]cystine uptake, GSH content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis in rat insulinoma cell line, RINm5F. Treatment of dRib decreased the intracellular l-[14C]cystine uptake and GSH content and increased the intracellular ROS levels, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), a cystine uptake enhancer, recovered the dRib-induced decrease in l-[14C]cystine uptake, GSH content, and cell viability in a Na+-independent manner. In the case of isolated islets, dRib dose-dependently decreased the intracellular l-[14C]cystine uptake and cell viability; however, dRib-induced cytotoxicity was completely recovered by adding N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). To confirm that system χc- mediates the oxidative stress-induced β-cell damage, we overexpressed xCT (the substrate-specific subunit of system χc-) using a lentiviral vector in RINm5F cells. Overexpression of xCT fully recovered the dRib-induced decrease in l-[14C]cystine uptake and GSH content and prevented the dRib-induced increase in ROS levels, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis. The overexpression of xCT showed a protective effect against dRib-induced oxidative damage in RINm5F cells. Our study showed that dRib depletes intracellular GSH content through inhibition of cystine transport via system χc- in β-cells.",

      "abstract": "d-Ribose-l-cysteine (DRLC) is an analogue of cysteine that has been shown to boost cellular antioxidant capacity by enhancing intracellular biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH). Deficiency of GSH has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with loss of memory. Thus, the use of antioxidants to prevent or retard the progression of memory deteriorations in persons with AD has been the focus of intense investigations. This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of DRLC on memory and scopolamine-induced amnesia, acetyl-cholinesterase activity, and oxidative stress in mice. Male Swiss mice were given oral administration of saline (10 ml/kg), DRLC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) or donepezil (1 mg/kg) 30 min before testing for memory performance using Y-maze and object recognition models. Another set of mice were also pretreated orally with saline, DRLC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) or donepezil (1 mg/kg) but in combination with scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 7 days. Thirty minutes after treatment on Day 7, memory function was then evaluated. The brain levels of acetyl-cholinesterase and oxidative stress parameters were assayed. DRLC significantly (p < .05) enhanced memory performance and attenuated scopolamine-induced amnesia. Increased acetyl-cholinesterase activity and oxidative stress, as shown by decreased antioxidant substrates (glutathione and catalase) and elevated malondialdehyde contents in mice with scopolamine amnesia were also attenuated by DRLC. Our findings suggest that inhibition of oxidative stress and acetyl-cholinesterase activity might contribute to the potential benefit of DRLC in persons with amnesia.",

A double-blind, six-month study was designed in which 53 patients were enrolled and randomized to take either a nutraceutical composition containing creatine, D-ribose, vitamin B1, and vitamin B6 (active treatment) or the placebo. Both the nutraceutical supplement and the placebo were supplied by Giellepi S.p.A. Health Science in Lissone, Italy. After six months of study, the cardiac double product at the peak of the load, the delta double product, and the chronotropic index were higher in the active treatment group than in the placebo group. We can conclude that a supplementation with creatine, D-ribose, vitamin B1, and vitamin B6, in addition to standard therapy and a physical exercise program, seems to be helpful in improving exercise tolerance compared to the placebo in a population with cardiovascular disease. However, this needs to be further studied, given that there is no clear evidence that the double product can be used as a surrogate measure of exercise tolerance.",

Here, we show that streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM rats showed cognitive impairment in both Y maze and Morris water maze assays, accompanied with D-ribose was significantly increased in blood and urine, in addition to D-glucose. Furthermore, advanced glycation end products (AGE), Tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal death in the hippocampal CA4/DG region were detected in T1DM rats. The expression and activity of transketolase (TKT), an important enzyme in the pentose shunt, were decreased in the brain, indicating that TKT may be involved in D-ribose metabolism in T1DM. Support for these change was demonstrated by the activation of TKT with benfotiamine (BTMP) treatment. Decreased D-ribose levels but not D-glucose levels; markedly reduced AGE accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal death; and improved cognitive ability in T1DM rats were shown after BTMP administration. In clinical investigation, T1DM patients had high D-ribose levels in both urine and serum. Our work suggests that D-ribose is involved in the cognitive impairment in T1DM and may provide a potentially novel target for treating diabetic encephalopathy.",

Starting from inexpensive d-ribose, an acyclic d-form carbohydrate precursor was synthesized to study a unique carbonyl translocation process. In this novel radical reaction, not only was the configuration of the sugar transformed from the d-form to the l-form, but also deoxygenation at the C(2) position of the sugar was successfully achieved. This is one of the most practical methods for converting a d-sugar to a 2-deoxy-l-sugar in a one-step reaction. To further identify the reaction product, radical reactions followed by treatment with 1,3-propanedithiol and then benzoylation were performed to afford a dithioacetal derivative. The stereochemistry and configuration of the 2-deoxy-l-ribose dithioacetal derivative were confirmed by its X-ray crystal structure. To further apply this methodology, a diethyl thioacetal derivative was formed, followed by selective benzoyl protection, and an NIS-initiated cyclization reaction to give the desired ethyl S-l-2-deoxyriboside, which can be used as a 2-deoxy-l-ribosyl synthon in the formal total synthesis of various l-deoxyribonucleosides, such as l-dT.",

      "abstract": "Over 18% of pregnant women are affected by diabetes mellitus (DM) and Insulin has been the commonest drug used in its treatment. There are reports of noncompliance to insulin due to trypanophobia, with suggestions for the use of oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs). However, the opposing views about the benefits and risk of oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) warrant a continuous search for an alternative regimen. Therefore, this study is aimed at comparing the antidiabetic effects of d-ribose-l-cysteine (riboceine) with vildagliptin, glibenclamide, metformin, glipizide and insulin in diabetes in pregnancy. Forty (40) female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were mated with twenty (20) male SD rats. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin and the female SD rats were divided into 8 groups of five (5) rats each. The animals were administered either of the OHAs vildagliptin, glibenclamide, metformin, glipizide and riboceine for a period of 19 gestational days. The results showed that streptozotocin (STZ) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the weights of the animals, increased malondialdehyde, blood glucose levels and altered reproductive hormones. These effects of STZ were better ameliorated in animals that received insulin and riboceine compared to the other OHAs. While progesterone levels were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in animals that received riboceine compared to insulin. Glibenclamide increased (p < 0.05) foetal weights compared to non-diabetic animals. In conclusion, glibenclamide may be a threat to mother`s life in the management of diabetes in pregnancy however, riboceine as well as vildagliptin, metformin and glipizide are effective oral hypoglycaemic agents which could serve as a potent adjuvant comparable to insulin in the management of diabetes during gestation."

      "abstract": "Recently, aberrantly high levels of D-ribose have been discovered in type II diabetic patients. D-ribose glycates proteins more rapidly than D-glucose, resulting in the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Accumulations of these products can be found in impaired renal function, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study tested whether D-ribose induces renal dysfunction via the RAGE-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway. In vivo, administration of D-ribose was found to lower blood glucose and regulate insulin tolerance. Compared to controls, urine nitrogen and creatinine excretion were increased in mice receiving D-ribose and were accompanied by severe pathological renal damage. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that NF-κB, AGEs, and receptor of AGEs (RAGE) increased in the kidneys of the mice with D-ribose treatment. In vitro, by western blot and immunofluorescent staining, we confirmed that D-ribose induced NF-κB activation and accumulation of AGEs and RAGE in mesangial cells. By co-immunoprecipitation, we found that the pull-down of RAGE remarkably increased the expression of NF-κB. Silencing the RAGE gene blocked the phosphorylation of NF-κB induced by D-ribose. These results strongly suggest that D-ribose induced NF-κB inflammation in a RAGE-dependent manner, which may be a triggering mechanism leading to nephropathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, affects 6.6 million adults with an estimated additional 3 million people by 2030. More than 50% of HF patients have heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). These patients have impaired cardiac muscle relaxation and diastolic filling, which investigators have associated with cellular energetic impairment. Patients with HFpEF experience symptoms of: (1) fatigue; (2) shortness of breath; and (3) swelling (edema) of the lower extremities. However, current HF guidelines offer no effective treatment to address these underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. Thus, we propose a biobehavioral symptom science study using ubiquinol and D-ribose (therapeutic interventions) to target mitochondrial bioenergetics to reduce the complex symptoms experienced by patients with HFpEF. METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the overall objective is to determine if administering ubiquinol and/or D-ribose to HFpEF patients for 12 weeks would decrease the severity of their complex symptoms and improve their cardiac function. The measures used to assess patients' perceptions of their health status and level of vigor (energy) will be the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Vigor subscale of the Profile of Mood States. The 6-min walk test will be used to test exercise tolerance. Left ventricular diastolic function will be assessed using innovative advanced echocardiography software called speckle tracking. We will measure B-type natriuretic peptides (secreted from ventricles in HF) and lactate/ATP ratio (measure of cellular energetics). DISCUSSIONS: Ubiquinol (active form of Coenzyme Q10) and D-ribose are two potential treatments that can positively affect cellular energetic impairment, the major underlying mechanism of HFpEF. Ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ10, is more effective in adults over the age of 50. In patients with HFpEF, mitochondrial deficiency of ubiquinol results in decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and reduced scavenging of reactive oxygen species. D-ribose is a substrate required for ATP synthesis and when administered has been shown to improve impaired myocardial bioenergetics. Therefore, if the biological underpinning of deficient mitochondrial ATP in HFpEF is not addressed, patients will suffer major symptoms including lack of energy, fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and exercise intolerance.

      "abstract": "Biofilms help bacteria survive under adverse conditions, and the quorum sensing (QS) system plays an important role in regulating their activities. Quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) have great potential to inhibit pathogenic biofilm formation and are considered possible replacements for antibiotics; however, further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms of action of QSIs and to avoid inhibitory effects on beneficial bacteria. Lactobacillus paraplantarum L-ZS9, isolated from fermented sausage, is a bacteriocin-producing bacteria that shows potential to be a probiotic starter. Since exogenous autoinducer-2 (AI-2) promoted biofilm formation of the strain, expression of genes involved in AI-2 production was determined in L. paraplantarum L-ZS9, especially the key gene luxS. D-Ribose was used to inhibit biofilm formation because of its AI-2 inhibitory activity. Twenty-seven differentially expressed proteins were identified by comparative proteomic analysis following D-ribose treatment and were functionally classified into six groups. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that AI-2 had a counteractive effect on transcription of the genes tuf, fba, gap, pgm, nfo, rib, and rpoN. Over-expression of the tuf, fba, gap, pgm, and rpoN genes promoted biofilm formation of L. paraplantarum L-ZS9, while over-expression of the nfo and rib genes inhibited biofilm formation. In conclusion, D-ribose inhibited biofilm formation of L. paraplantarum L-ZS9 by regulating multiple genes involved in the glycolytic pathway, extracellular DNA degradation and transcription, and translation. This research provides a new mechanism of QSI regulation of biofilm formation of Lactobacillus and offers a valuable reference for QSI application in the future."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of D-ribose and L-cysteine on aluminum-induced testicular damage in male Sprague-Dawley rats. METHOD: A total number of thirty-five (35) adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups (AD). Group A (comprised five (5) rats) was designated the Control Group that received Physiological Saline; while groups B, C, and D (comprised ten (10) rats) were given 75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg of body weight of aluminum chloride respectively for 39 days. At day 40, the aluminum-treated groups were subdivided into sub-groups (B1, C1, D1) comprising of five (5) rats each, and 30 mg/kg body weight of Riboceine were administered for twenty (20) days. Groups B, C and D remained on the normal dosage of aluminum chloride for three more weeks (59 days). RESULTS: Andrological parameters (Sperm count, motility, morphology and testosterone) in the aluminum-treated Groups B and C showed no significant difference in their mean values when compared with their control counterparts, whereas there was a significant reduction in the andrological parameters in Group D rats when compared with the Control animals. Histoarchitecture of the testes \"stain with H&E\" of Group A, B and C rats appeared normal while Group D rats showed testicular damages with several abnormal seminiferous tubules with incomplete maturation of germinal cell layers and absence of spermatozoa in their lumen; Leydig cells appear hyperplastic. Group B1, C1 and D1 andrological and histological parameters appeared normal. CONCLUSION: Riboceine treatment significantly attenuates aluminum-induced testicular toxicity in male Sprague-Dawley in rats.",

A multicopy suppression strategy that overexpressed Mt-DprE1 in M. bovis BCG was used to profile the publically available GlaxoSmithKline antimycobacterial compound set, and one compound (GSK710) was identified that showed an 8-fold higher minimum inhibitory concentration relative to the control strain. Analogues of GSK710 show a clear relationship between whole cell potency and in vitro activity using an enzymatic assay employing recombinant Mt-DprE1, with binding affinity measured by fluorescence quenching of the flavin cofactor of the enzyme. M. bovis BCG spontaneous resistant mutants to GSK710 and a closely related analogue were isolated and sequencing of ten such mutants revealed a single point mutation at two sites, E221Q or G248S within DprE1, providing further evidence that DprE1 is the main target of these compounds. Finally, time-lapse microscopy experiments showed that exposure of M. tuberculosis to a compound of this series arrests bacterial growth rapidly followed by a slower cytolysis phase."

Benzothiazoles exert their bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) through potent inhibition of decaprenylphosphoryl-β-d-ribose 2'-oxidase (DprE1), the key enzyme involved in arabinogalactan synthesis. Specific target linkage and mode of binding were established using co-crystallization and protein mass spectrometry studies. Most importantly, the current study provides insights on the utilization of systematic medicinal chemistry approaches to mitigate safety liabilities while improving potency during progression from an initial genotoxic hit, the benzothiazole N-oxides (BTOs) to the lead-like AMES negative, crowded benzothiazoles (cBTs). These findings offer opportunities for development of safe clinical candidates against tuberculosis. The design strategy adopted could find potential application in discovery of safe drugs in other therapy areas too.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of captopril on dRib‑induced damage in pancreatic β‑cells, as well as to determine the mechanisms underlying these effects. Treatment with dRib increased the levels of cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and intracellular reactive oxygen species in Syrian hamster insulinoma HIT‑T15 cells; however, pretreatment with captopril significantly inhibited the effects of dRib. The intracellular levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione were depleted following treatment with dRib; however, these levels were restored following HIT‑T15 cell treatment with captopril. In rat islets, dRib stimulation suppressed the mRNA expression levels of insulin, and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1, as well as insulin content; however, these effects were dose‑dependently reversed by treatment with captopril. Treatment with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of intracellular glutathione biosynthesis, inhibited the protective effects of captopril on dRib‑mediated glutathione depletion and cytotoxicity in HIT‑T15 cells. Following incubation with albumin, dRib increased the formation of dicarbonyl and advanced glycation end products. Treatment with captopril did not inhibit the dRib‑induced increase in production of dicarbonyl and advanced glycation end products. In conclusion, treatment with captopril reversed dRib‑induced oxidative damage and suppression of insulin expression in β‑cells. The mechanism underlying the protective effects of captopril may involve increased intracellular glutathione production, rather than protein glycation.",

This study describes the inhibitory effect of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on the D-ribose glycation of bovine serum albumin (BSA). A combination of analytical methods including ultraviolet-visible spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, circular dichroism, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry were used to determine the extent of BSA glycation in the presence of citrate reduced spherical GNPs of various sizes and concentrations. GNPs of particle diameters ranging from 2 nm to 20 nm inhibited BSA's AGE formation. The extent of inhibition correlated with the total surface area of the nanoparticles. GNPs of highest total surface area yielded the most inhibition whereas those with the lowest total surface area inhibited the formation of AGEs the least. Additionally, when GNPs' total surface areas were set the same, their antiglycation activities were similar. This inhibitory effect of GNPs on BSA's glycation by D-ribose suggests that colloidal particles may have a therapeutic application for the treatment of diabetes and conditions that promote hyperglycemia.",

This is indeed an extremely complex process and analysis of the mechanism at the molecular level is of crucial interest. Such collision reactions of protons on biological targets induce different reactions: excitation and ionization of the biomolecule, fragmentation of the ionized species, and charge transfer from the projectile ion toward the biomolecular target. In order to have an insight into such mechanisms, we have performed a theoretical approach of two of the most important steps, the fragmentation and the charge transfer processes. For that purpose, we have considered collision of protons with isolated 2-deoxy-D-ribose by means of ab-initio molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry molecular methods. The conformation of the sugar moiety has been analyzed and appears to induce important effects, in particular different fragmentation patterns have been pointed out with regard to the conformation, and significant variations of the charge transfer cross sections have been exhibited.",

In addition, experimental vibrational studies using both nonchiroptical (IR-Raman) and chiroptical (VCD) techniques have been carried out. The theoretical and experimental results show that α- and β-pyranose forms are the dominant configurations for both compounds.

Stimulation with 50 mM dRib elevated cytotoxicity, apoptosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in HIT-T15 cells, but pretreatment with LA significantly reversed the dRib-induced changes. LA directly scavenged hydroxyl radicals generated by a Fenton reaction. Intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were depleted by stimulation with dRib but levels were restored by addition of LA to HIT-T15 cells. However, the GSH/GSSG ratio was unchanged by LA treatment. In rat islets, stimulation with 10 mM dRib for 6 h suppressed expression of insulin and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 mRNA and decreased insulin content, but these were dose-dependently reversed when LA was added. Treatment with l-buthionine-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of intracellular glutathione biosynthesis, completely abolished the protective effects of LA on dRib-mediated glutathione depletion and cytotoxicity in HIT-T15 cells. In summary, LA reversed the dRib-induced oxidative damage and suppression of insulin expression in β-cells. Enhanced intracellular total glutathione production, rather than the scavenging of ROS, is possibly the mechanism for the protective effect of LA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current treatments for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (collectively called myositis) focus on the suppression of an autoimmune inflammatory response within the skeletal muscle. However, it has been observed that there is a poor correlation between the successful suppression of muscle inflammation and an improvement in muscle function. Some evidence in the literature suggests that metabolic abnormalities in the skeletal muscle underlie the weakness that continues despite successful immunosuppression. We have previously shown that decreased expression of a purine nucleotide cycle enzyme, adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD1), leads to muscle weakness in a mouse model of myositis and may provide a mechanistic basis for muscle weakness. One of the downstream metabolites of this pathway, D-ribose, has been reported to alleviate symptoms of myalgia in patients with a congenital loss of AMPD1. Therefore, we hypothesized that supplementing exogenous D-ribose would improve muscle function in the mouse model of myositis. We treated normal and myositis mice with daily doses of D-ribose (4 mg/kg) over a 6-week time period and assessed its effects using a battery of behavioral, functional, histological and molecular measures. RESULTS: Treatment with D-ribose was found to have no statistically significant effects on body weight, grip strength, open field behavioral activity, maximal and specific forces of EDL, soleus muscles, or histological features. Histological and gene expression analysis indicated that muscle tissues remained inflamed despite treatment. Gene expression analysis also suggested that low levels of the ribokinase enzyme in the skeletal muscle might prevent skeletal muscle tissue from effectively utilizing D-ribose. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with daily oral doses of D-ribose showed no significant effect on either disease progression or muscle function in the mouse model of myositis.",

Forty-eight mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, cisplatin, cisplatin + ribose, and ribose. Mice were given cisplatin (20 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) with or without D-ribose (400 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally, immediately after cisplatin injection). At 72 h after cisplatin injection, we measured serum and renal tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and renal monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; renal expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction; serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine; and histological changes. Cisplatin increased serum and renal TNF-α concentrations, renal MCP-1 concentration, and renal ICAM-1 mRNA expression. Treatment with D-ribose attenuated the increase in serum and renal TNF-α concentrations, renal MCP-1 concentration, and renal ICAM-1 mRNA expression. Consequently, cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction and renal tubular necrosis were attenuated by D-ribose treatment. This is believed to be the first time that protective effects of D-ribose on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity via inhibition of inflammatory reactions have been investigated. Thus, D-ribose may become a new therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Reducing sugar 2-deoxy-D-ribose (dRib) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) through autoxidation and protein glycosylation and causes dysfunction of osteoblasts. In the present study, glabridin, a natural flavonoid, was investigated to determine whether it could influence dRib-induced oxidative damage and cellular dysfunction in the MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cell line. Osteoblastic cells were treated with dRib in the presence or absence of glabridin. Cell viability, apoptosis, ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) were subsequently examined. It was observed that dRib reduced cell survival and ΔΨm, while it markedly increased intracellular levels of ROS and apoptosis. However, pretreatment of cells with glabridin attenuated all the dRib-induced effects. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) also prevented dRib-induced oxidative cell damage. In addition, treatment with glabridin resulted in a significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, collagen contents and osteoblast differentiation genes [ALP, collagen, osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin (OC)] and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) genes (BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7). In mechanistic studies of the antioxidative potential of glabridin, we found that glabridin activated dRib-induced decreased expression of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B 2 (AKT2) genes, which are master regulators of survival-related signaling pathways. Glabridin also upregulated the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which were inhibited by dRib. Taken together, these results suggest that glabridin attenuates dRib-induced cell damage in osteoblastic cells and may be useful for the treatment of diabetes-related bone disease.",

Kinetic analyses revealed that Cf2891 competes with inorganic phosphate (P(i)) for binding to the NPs and, depending on the nature of the enzyme, acts as a competitive or non-competitive inhibitor with regard to the nucleoside binding site. Also, the compound prevents breakdown of pyrimidine analogues used in the treatment of viral infections and cancer. Since NPs are abundantly present in tumor tissue and may be overexpressed due to secondary bacterial infections in immunocompromised patients suffering viral infections, Cf2891 may serve as a lead molecule for the development of inhibitors to be used in nucleoside-based combination therapy.",

Using trypan blue staining and flow cytometry with annexin V/PI staining, gliclazide treatment slightly reversed dRib-induced cell death and apoptosis, and NAC treatment markedly reduced both measures. Likewise, flow cytometry using DHR 123 staining showed that the levels of dRib-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) were partially suppressed by gliclazide and completely inhibited by NAC. Using electron spin resonance spectrometry, gliclazide and NAC scavenged hydroxyl radicals generated by Fenton reaction to a similar degree in a cell-free system. NAC, but not gliclazide, completely restored the intracellular glutathione depleted by dRib using monochlorobimane fluorescence and glutathione assays. Thus, gliclazide treatment suppressed dRib-induced oxidative damage in HIT-T15 cells less than NAC did because gliclazide did not restore the intracellular glutathione content as effectively as NAC. In addition, the elevation of intracellular glutathione rather than free radical scavenging might be an important mechanism for protecting against dRib-induced oxidative damage in a β-cell line.",

However, whether D-ribose participates in glycation and leads to production of AGEs in vivo still requires investigation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we treated cultured cells and mice with D-ribose and D-glucose to compare ribosylation and glucosylation for production of AGEs. Treatment with D-ribose decreased cell viability and induced more AGE accumulation in cells. C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally injected with D-ribose for 30 days showed high blood levels of glycated proteins and AGEs. Administration of high doses D-ribose also accelerated AGE formation in the mouse brain and induced impairment of spatial learning and memory ability according to the performance in Morris water maze test. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate that D-ribose but not D-glucose reacts rapidly with proteins and produces significant amounts of AGEs in both cultured cells and the mouse brain, leading to accumulation of AGEs which may impair mouse spatial cognition.",

      "abstract": "Tuberculosis is still a leading cause of death in developing countries and a resurgent disease in developed countries. The selection and soaring spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant strains (XDR-TB) is a severe public health problem. Currently, there is an urgent need of new drugs for tuberculosis treatment, with novel mechanisms of action and, moreover, the necessity to identify new drug targets. Several enzymes involved in various metabolic processes have been described as potential targets for the development of new drugs. Recently, two different classes of most promising drugs, the benzothiazinones (BTZ) and the dinitrobenzamide derivatives (DNB), have been found to be highly active against M. tuberculosis, including XDR-TB strains. Interestingly, both drugs have the same target: the heteromeric decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D-ribose 2'-epimerase encoded by dprE1 (Rv3790) and dprE2 (Rv3791) genes, respectively. DprE1 and DprE2 are involved in the biosynthesis of D-arabinose and, in particular, they are essential to perform the transformation of decaprenylphosphoryl-D-ribose to decaprenylphosphoryl-D-arabinose, which is a substrate for arabinosyltransferases in the synthesis of the cell-envelope arabinogalactan and liporabinomannan polysaccharides of mycobacteria. Arabinogalactan is a fundamental component of the mycobacterial cell wall, which covalently binds the outer layer of mycolic acids to peptidoglycan. The heteromeric decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D-ribose 2'-epimerase thus represents a valid vulnerable antimycobacterial drug target which could result in \"magic\" for tuberculosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor metastasis and progression, and thus inhibiting angiogenesis is a promising strategy for treatment of cancer. However, tumor-associated angiogenesis is influenced by various angiogenic factors in the tumor microenvironment. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP, EC 2. 4. 2. 4), an enzyme involved in the reversible conversion of thymidine to thymine, is an important mediator of angiogenesis, tumorigenicity, metastasis and invasion. The angiogenic effect of TP requires the enzymatic activity of TP. TP activity is expressed at higher levels in a wide variety of solid tumors than in adjacent non-neoplastic tissue. The tumor microenvironment (hypoxia, acidosis) regulates the expression of TP, and TP expression in tumor tissue shows significant correlation with microvessel density and poor prognosis. 2-Deoxy-D-ribose (D-dRib), one of the degradation products of thymidine generated by TP activity, promotes angiogenesis and the chemotactic activity of endothelial cells and also confers resistance to hypoxia-induced apoptosis in some cancer cell lines. These findings suggest that D-dRib is a downstream mediator of TP function. 2-Deoxy-L-ribose, a stereoisomer of D-dRib, can inhibit D-dRib's anti-apoptotic effects and suppress metastasis and invasion of TP-expressing tumors in mice. Although the mechanism of action of D-dRib is still unknown, the physiological activities of D-dRib have recently been reported by several groups. We review the role of D-dRib in tumor progression and discuss inhibition of D-dRib as a promising approach for chemotherapy of various tumors.",

The clinical presentation is characterized by severe neurological involvement including hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay and autistic features. Epilepsy in ADSL deficiency is frequent and occurs in approximately two-thirds of patients, beginning either early in the neonatal period or after the first year of life. At present there is no treatment of proven clinical efficacy. Despite of the increasing number of ADSL-deficient patients reported, there are only a few communications of therapeutic considerations or efforts. Among them only two showed some beneficial effects in ADSL-deficient patients. D-ribose, a simple and relatively cheap therapy, has been associated with improvement of behaviour and progressive reduction of the seizure frequency in one 13-year-old patient with ADSL deficiency. In this study we have re-examined D-ribose treatment in four ADSL-deficient patients. Assessments consisted of biochemical markers and neurological outcome. The 12-month trial of D-ribose failed to show any clinical benefit in ADSL patients with both milder and severe phenotype. D-ribose administration was accompanied by neither reduction in seizure frequency nor growth enhancement. Additionally, patients with milder type II presented the first seizure after 4 and 8 months of the D-ribose treatment. Therefore, we could not confirm a positive effect of D-ribose as previously reported.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is caused by imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and biological system ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or repair the resulting damage. 2-deoxy-D-ribose (dRib) is known to induce apoptosis by provoking an oxidative stress by depleting glutathione (GSH). In this paper, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying GSH depletion in response to dRib treatment. We demonstrated that the observed GSH depletion is not only due to inhibition of synthesis, by inhibiting gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase, but also due to its increased efflux, by the activity of multidrug resistance associated proteins transporters. We conclude that dRib interferes with GSH homeostasis and that likely cellular oxidative stress is a consequence of GSH depletion. Various GSH fates, such as direct oxidation, lack of synthesis or of storage, characterize different kinds of oxidative stress. In the light of our observations we conclude that dRib does not induce GSH oxidation but interferes with GSH synthesis and storage. Lack of GSH allows accumulation of ROS and cells, disarmed against oxidative insults, undergo apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Although some clinical evidences suggest the use of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) in diabetes with nephropathy, the exact mechanism of PLP has not been fully understood. In the present study, the effect of PLP on 2-deoxy-D-ribose (dRib)-induced oxidative damages and apoptosis on human monocytic cells (U937) was investigated. U937 cells exposed to dRib (30 mM) exhibited abnormal properties, including loss pf cell viability, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione depletion and some biochemical features of apoptosis. Treatment with PLP at two effective concentrations (100 and 250 microM) strongly inhibited ROS production and glutathione depletion in dRib-treated U937 cells. The extent of Lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation was also decreased in the presence of PLP. In addition, PLP suppressed dRib-induced apoptotic criteria such as sub-G1 apoptotic population and annexin-V staining. The use of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a thiol antioxidant and GSH precursor, prevented the extent of apoptosis. The results demonstrate that dRib induces the generation of ROS leading to dRib-mediated apoptosis which can be attenuated by PLP through antioxidant mechanisms.",

External observations of fetuses and placentas were unremarkable across the study groups. Mean fetal and placental weights, across all viable fetuses, did not differ significantly between treated and control groups. Observations of visceral malformations, anomalies, and variations were unremarkable and did not differ between treated and control groups. In summary, administration of DR to pregnant rats at concentrations up to 20% of the diet resulted in no significant adverse effects on the developing embryo/fetus at doses that were not otherwise a severe metabolic stress on the dam.

Groups of 20 male and 20 female rats were exposed via the diet to 0%, 5%, 10%, or 20% DR, seven days per week (mean daily intake of 0.0, 3.6, 7.6, and 15.0 g/kg body weight/day in males and 0.0, 4.4, 8.5, and 15.7 g/kg body weight/day in females), for 13 consecutive weeks. Mean feed consumption and feed conversion efficiency values were comparable across all study groups; however, and mean body weights of all treated animals were decreased relative to those of controls. Absolute cecal weights were increased in the mid- and high-dose animals, and the relative weights were increased in all treated animals. Analysis of microscopic histopathology revealed no evidence of changes that could be attributed to the DR treatment. It is scientifically reasonable to conclude that the present study supports a concentration of 5% DR in the diet, corresponding to an average daily intake of DR of 3.6 and 4.4 g/kg body weight/day in male and female rats, respectively, as being the absolute no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for this substance.",

Ar+ ions with kinetic energies down to 15 eV induce effective decomposition of both sugar molecules, leading to the desorption of abundant cation and anion fragments, including CH3+, C2H3+, C3H3+, H3O+, CHO+, CH3O+, C2H3O+, H-, O-, and OH-, etc. Use of isotopically labelled molecules (5- 13C D-ribose and 1-D D-ribose) reveals the site specificity for some of the fragment origins, and thus the nature of the chemical bond breaking. It is found that all of the chemical bonds in both molecules are vulnerable to ion impact at energies down to 15 eV, particularly both the endo- and exocyclic C-O bonds. In addition to molecular fragmentation, several chemical reactions are also observed. A small amount of O-/O fragments abstract hydrogen to form OH-. It is found that the formation of the H3O+ ion is related to the hydroxyl groups of the sugar molecules, and is associated with additional hydrogen loss from the parent or adjacent molecules via hydrogen abstraction or proton transfer. The formation of several other cation fragments also requires hydrogen abstraction from its parent or an adjacent molecule. These fragmentations and reactions are likely to occur in a real biomedium during ionizing radiation treatment of tumors and thus bear significant radiobiological relevance.",

Here, we have characterized the intracellular events underlying the apoptotic effects of dRib and the involvement of polyamines in these effects. Treatment of HL-60 cells with dRib induces loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, radical oxygen species production, intracellular glutathione depletion and translocation of Bax from cytosol to membranes. These effects are followed by cell death. However, the mode of cell death caused by dRib depends on intracellular levels of polyamines. d-Rib-treated cells with normal polyamine levels, progressing through the G(1) into the S and G(2)/M phases, undergo apoptosis, while in polyamine-depleted cells, being blocked at the G(1) phase, cell death mechanisms are switched to necrosis. The present study points to a relationship between the cell cycle distribution and the mode of cell death, and suggests that the level of intracellular spermidine, essential to cell cycle progression, may determine whether a cell dies by apoptosis or necrosis in response to a death stimulus.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Colorectal neoplasms remain a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. A recognized weakness of conventional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy relates to expression of the intracellular enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase (TP). Although TP promotes 5-FU cytotoxicity, TP-derived 2-deoxy-D-ribose (dRib) counterproductively stimulates tumor angiogenesis. Here, the newly discovered antiangiogenic drug rapamycin was combined with 5-FU to counteract the potential escape mechanism of dRib-induced angiogenesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Orthotopic tumor growth was assessed in rapamycin and 5-FU-treated BALB/c mice with TP-expressing CT-26 colon adenocarcinoma cells. To examine liver metastasis, green-fluorescent protein-transfected CT-26 cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy after intraportal injection. Cell counting and Ki67 staining were used to determine in vitro and in vivo cell expansion, respectively. In vitro angiogenic effects of dRib were assessed with endothelial cell migration and aortic ring assays. Western blotting detected dRib effects on p70/S6 kinase activation. RESULTS: Rapamycin treatment of mice bearing orthotopic tumors inhibited tumor growth more than did 5-FU, and mice treated with both drugs typically developed no tumors. In the liver metastasis assay, combination therapy blocked metastatic expansion of solitary tumor cells. Interestingly, complex drug activities were suggested by tumor-cell proliferation being more sensitive to 5-FU than to rapamycin in vitro, but more sensitive to rapamycin in vivo. With regard to angiogenesis, dRib-induced endothelial cell migration and aortic ring formation were completely abrogated by rapamycin, correlating with blockage of dRib-induced p70/S6 kinase activation in endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of dRib-induced angiogenesis with rapamycin counteracts a potential TP-based escape mechanism for colorectal cancer under 5-FU therapy, introducing a novel, clinically feasible, combination treatment option for this common neoplasm.",

This was a prospective, double blind, randomized, crossover design study, to assess the effect of oral D-ribose supplementation on cardiac hemodynamics and quality of life in 15 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and CHF. The study consisted of two treatment periods of 3 weeks, during which either oral D-ribose or placebo was administered followed by a 1-week wash out period, and then administration of the other supplement. Assessment of myocardial functional parameters by echocardiography, quality of life using the SF-36 questionnaire and functional capacity using cycle ergometer testing was performed. The administration of D-ribose resulted in an enhancement of atrial contribution to left ventricular filling (40+/-11 vs. 45+/-9%, P=0.02), a smaller left atrial dimension (54+/-20 vs. 47+/-18 ml, P=0.02) and a shortened E wave deceleration (235+/-64 vs. 196+/-42, P=0.002) by echocardiography. Further, D-ribose also demonstrated a significant improvement of the patient's quality of life (417+/-118 vs. 467+/-128, P< or =0.01). In comparison, placebo did not result in any significant echocardiographic changes or in quality of life.

It inhibits hypoxia-induced caspase 3 activation, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in human leukemia HL-60 cell line. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism by which 2-deoxy-d-ribose confers the resistance to apoptosis. Thus 2-deoxy-D-ribose-modulated suppression of HIF-1 alpha expression could prevent the hypoxia-induced decrease of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) on the mitochondria. 2-Deoxy-L-ribose and its analogs may enhance apoptosis and suppress the growth of tumors by competitively inhibiting the activities of 2-deoxy-d-ribose and thus these analogs show promise for anti-tumor therapy.",

      "abstract": "To determine whether seven days oral D-ribose would improve exercise tolerance in a group of 5 patients with McArdle's disease, we performed a double blind placebo controlled crossover trial. Subjects performed weekly treadmill exercise tests with expired gas analysis until their times were reproducible. They then received 60 g D-ribose daily or placebo for seven days. Exercise testing was repeated on completion of this period. A seven day washout period then followed. Subjects then performed a new baseline exercise test prior to starting the other solution. Again after seven days the exercise test was repeated. There was no significant difference between pre-treatment exercise tests for peak oxygen consumption or level of leg fatigue. Patients did not like taking the ribose and D-Ribose does not appear to be of benefit to patients with McArdle's disease.",

      "abstract": "D-ribose was given orally and/or intravenously to nine healthy subjects at doses ranging from 83.3 to 222.2 mg/kg per hour for at least four hours. The serum ribose level increased in a dose-dependent manner to maximum concentrations of 75 to 85 mg/dl. The serum glucose level decreased after the beginning of continuous ribose administration and was reduced as long as ribose was being administered. The oral or intravenous administration of 166.7 mg/kg per hour of ribose resulted in a 25% decrease in serum glucose. Higher intravenous doses of ribose did not provoke a further decrease in serum glucose concentration. Oral administration of 166.7 mg/kg per hour led to an increase in serum insulin concentrations from a mean of 8.4 (range 6.4-11.5) to 10.4 (range 6.3-15.4) microU/ml (p less than 0.05). In contrast, intravenous administration did not change serum insulin concentrations significantly. The serum c-peptide concentration remained unchanged regardless of treatment. We conclude that the variations in plasma insulin concentrations do not account for the observed decrease in mean serum glucose concentrations accompanying D-ribose administration.",
