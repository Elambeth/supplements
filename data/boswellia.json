      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) yields excellent local control in patients with a limited number of brain metastases (BMs), but radiation-induced cerebral edema and radiation necrosis (RN) in particular may cause dose-limiting late toxicity, with the same holding true after fractionated radiation therapy for glioma. In symptomatic patients, the first-line standard of care includes corticosteroids, which may, however, be counterproductive in the evolving era of immunotherapy. Boswellic acid (BA), available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement, has been suggested as a potential corticosteroid-sparing alternative because of its anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic effects. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases, identifying publications reporting on the use of BA during or after brain irradiation in humans. Using the Realist and Meta-Narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards framework, relevant data are summarized using a meta-narrative approach. RESULTS: Six records (3 for edema reduction in large irradiated volumes and 3 for RN after SRS) were identified, encompassing 130 patients. Roughly half of patients benefited from BA (radiographically or clinically) and about one third could successfully taper dexamethasone or prevent its long-term intake. Tolerability of BA was favorable, with mild gastrointestinal discomfort being reported most frequently. Current drawbacks include unknown optimal formulation as well as timing and dosing, a considerably large number of required daily capsules, and uncertain interactions with other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the clinical evidence on the use of BA for radiation-induced cerebral edema and RN is lacking and well-designed prospective trials are warranted to further investigate this potential low-cost corticosteroid-sparing option."

      "abstract": "Due to its intricacy and long-term usefulness, traditional medicine continues to be practiced in several nations. Among the many medicinal plants found in the Dhofar region of Oman, the aromatic oleo-gum resin generated by Boswellia sacra, commonly referred to as frankincense, stands out for its medical and commercial significance. Resin-carrying ducts are unique to members of the Boswellia family. Boswellia sacra Flueck is one of the 29 species in the genus Boswellia (Burseraceae) and has long been cultivated for its aromatic gums and resins for use as incense. In addition to the resins (60%-80% alcohol soluble), gums (15%-20% water soluble), and essential oil (5%-7%), other components, including polysaccharides and polymeric compounds, also exist in smaller amounts. Physiochemical analyses indicate that Boswellia resin oil is made up of 42.5% diterpenes, 13.1% monoterpenes, and 1% sesquiterpenes. Traditional medicine makes extensive use of frankincense for the treatment of stomach diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatic illnesses. The bioactive chemicals present in frankincense, particularly boswellic acids, are plentiful. The current review examines various compounds present in different species of Boswellia, especially Boswellia sacra, along with their structure."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Radiation necrosis (RN) is a dose-limiting toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases. Oral corticosteroids are not optimal for long-term management, given multiple side effects. Boswellia serrata (BS) is an over-the-counter supplement traditionally known for its anti-inflammatory properties and has recently been shown to reduce cerebral edema. We evaluated the response rates of BS in a series of patients with RN after SRS for brain metastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified patients who developed any grade RN after SRS and received BS for ≥2 months at a target dose of 4050 to 4500 mg daily. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), including complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), defined as ≥30% decrease in edema volume on T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging from baseline. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients received BS, of which 94 patients with adequate follow-up were included. The median SRS dose was 24 Gy in 3 fractions, and 44%, 47%, and 9% of patients had grade 1, 2, and 3 RN, respectively. The best response was CR in 12% and PR in 48%, while 28% had stable edema and 12% had progression of edema. The overall ORR was 59.6% (95% CI, 48.9%-69.6%). ORR was 62%, 63%, and 33% for grade 1, 2, and 3 RN, respectively. The median duration of response in patients with CR or PR was 13.9 months (IQR, 9-23). Among 69 patients (73%) who never received steroids, received prior steroids only, or had a stable or decreasing steroid requirement of ≤4 mg per day of dexamethasone for at least >1 week prior to starting Boswellia, the ORR was 63.8%. Fourteen percent of patients had National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1, and 2% had grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. A total of 67% of patients remained on BS at the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that BS is a safe and feasible treatment option for grade 1 to 3 RN after SRS. Further prospective studies comparing BS with a placebo are warranted."

This study investigates the potential of Rhuleave-K, a turmeric-Boswellia formulation for managing these symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Rhuleave-K (500 mg) over 15 days in alleviating posture-related low back soreness and discomfort in human participants. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel arm study involved 52 subjects aged 18-70 years, with an equal male to female ratio of 1:1, and a 15 days intervention period. The inclusion criteria were a posture-related low back soreness and discomfort for at least 2-3 weeks with a pain intensity of greater than or equal to 5 on numerical rating scale. The primary outcome measure was a pain intensity difference from baseline to day 7 and day 15. Secondary outcome measures were a categorical pain relief scale and Oswestry disability index (ODI). RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the pain intensity (p < 0.001) compared to placebo at the end of 15 days of study in the Rhuleave-K group. After 7 days of supplementation of Rhuleave-K, there was a 56% reduction in pain intensity and by the end of the study, there was 98.5% reduction. In the responder profile of those having greater than or equal to 50% of max total pain relief, all 26 was in Rhuelave-K group and 3 were in placebo group. The ODI had significant 27% and 98% reduction in the disability index at day 7 and 15 respectively for Rhuleave-K group and placebo group had 1% and 3% change. CONCLUSION: Posture-related low back soreness and discomfort was significantly reduced by Rhuleave-K at 500 mg dose. It is hence evident from this study's outcome that the Rhuleave-K can be a safe and effective alternative for the short-term management of lower back discomfort."

      "abstract": "The resin of Commiphora africana and the resin and bark of Boswellia papyrifera play versatile roles in traditional Sudanese culture, including use in inhalation therapy, liquid remedies, and as chewing gum. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the volatile compounds in these materials using various extraction methods and assess their biological activities. Extraction methods included MonoTrap solid-phase microextraction, smoke solvent trapping, and acetone immersion. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of MonoTrap extracts identified highly volatile compounds, while smoke extracts contained compounds with lower volatility. Solvent immersion captured a broader range of compounds. The resin of C. africana was rich in limonene, verbenone, and β-selinene, whereas B. papyrifera extracts contained octyl acetate, trans-nerolidol, and nerolidol isobutyrate as major compounds. Biological assays showed C. africana smoke extract inhibited tyrosinase activity, with p-cymene and S-limonene acting as competitive inhibitors. It also inhibited the growth of cancer cells, A549 and MIA Paca-2, while solvent extracts from both resins inhibited all tested cell lines. Further, the acetone extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans. These results highlight the differences in chemical composition between the two species, the impact of extraction methods, and the therapeutic potential of C. africana and B. papyrifera as sources of bioactive compounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is the prevailing form of inflammatory condition in joints of adults and the aging population, leading to long-term disability and chronic pain. Current therapeutic options have variable therapeutic efficacy and/or several side effects. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 62 participants using a nutraceutical [standardized Boswellia serrata Roxb. gum resin (300 mg) and Apium graveolens L. seed extract (250 mg)], to determine its safety and efficacy for supporting cartilage health and reduction in knee osteoarthritis symptoms. All participants were assessed for physical function and pain with the help of WOMAC, VAS, Physicians' Global Assessment for the six-minute walk test/pain. Knee X-ray, KOOS questionnaire score, and FACIT-F score were assessed. Additionally, inflammatory, cartilage degeneration and regeneration biomarkers in serum and urine were evaluated at baseline and after 90 days of treatment. RESULTS: Oral administration of the nutraceutical resulted in prolonged symptomatic relief with reduced pain, stiffness, and swelling. Inflammatory (serum IL-7, IL-1, IL-6, hs-CRP, TNF-α, ESR) and cartilage degeneration biomarkers (serum CTX-II, COMP, MMP-3 and urinary CTX-II) were decreased in the nutraceutical group compared to baseline and placebo. Furthermore, serum N-propeptide of collagen IIA (PIIANP) and procollagen-type-C propeptide (PIICP) levels were increased in the nutraceutical group, suggesting collagen synthesis contributing to cartilage regeneration. At given doses for 90 days, there were no adverse effects based on the clinical examination, biochemical, hematological, and ECG analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the combination of Boswellia and celery could be a safe and promising herbal nutraceutical option for managing osteoarthritis and cartilage health effectively.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Turmeric and boswellia supplements have gained popularity for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is important to critically assess the safety of such supplements for prolonged use. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and tolerability of turmeric-boswellia-sesame oil formulation (TBSF) in healthy human volunteers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty participants were supplemented with TBSF at a dose of 2,000 mg daily for 90 days. Safety assessments were performed at baseline, as well as on day 30, 60 and 90. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study period. Any evidence of hepatotoxicity injury or drug induced liver injury (DILI) was assessed using R value (R ratio/R factor), which is a relative pattern of liver enzymes. Additionally, Hy's law criteria, based on liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, were employed, along with an evaluation of drug-induced serious hepatotoxicity (eDISH) plot. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated, as these values are relevant to the safety of the intervention. RESULTS: The study found that TBSF supplementation did not cause any adverse effects or clinically significant variations in vital signs, hematological parameters, lipid profile, liver function enzymes, and renal function markers, and all were within the normal range after 90 days of TBSF supplementation. Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and NLR did not change significantly and were within the normal range. All the participants when plotted were in the normal range quadrant of the eDISH plot throughout the study period. No abnormal findings were observed in R value and Hy's law criteria, indicating that TBSF does not induce any hepatotoxicity. The present study showed a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), Cr clearance, and BUN/Cr ratio throughout the study period. There was no significant change between these values at 4 abovementioned time points. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that TBSF is a safe supplement for regular and long-term consumption."

However, knowledge of its seed characteristics and germination behaviour is lacking. (2) Methods: The aim of this research was to characterise the seeds and evaluate the effects of seed colour and controlled temperatures on seed germination. The seeds were segregated into the following colour categories: light brown (LB), brown (B), and dark brown (DB). The seeds were evaluated under controlled constant temperatures (23 °C) and at room (fluctuating) temperature independently. One-way ANOVA, t-test, and germination indexes were used for analyses. (3) Results: The results showed significant differences in the mean seed masses of LB, B, and DB seeds. Similarly, the differently coloured seeds varied in their water imbibition rates. The result showed significant differences in the mean germination of the seeds in both the controlled temperature (23 °C) and room-temperature chambers among the LB, B, and DB seeds. However, the t-test revealed no significant differences in the mean germination of the seeds of similar colours between controlled temperature and room temperature conditions. (4) Conclusions: The seed's colour significantly influenced the seed mass, water imbibition capacity, and germination rate relative to the temperature treatment. Dark brown seeds are recommended for seed collection aimed at seedling propagation."

Long-term exposure to nephrotoxic molecules causes chronic renal damage that causes fibrosis and loss of function. Such damage can be initiated by oxidative stress which provokes inflammation. We aim at investigating the potential therapeutic effects of Boswellia serrata (BS) gum resin extract in managing CCl4-induced renal toxicity. Methods: Male Wistar albino rats were assigned to groups: healthy control; CCl4-treated (CCl4, twice/week, for 6 weeks); CCl4 + BS-treated: CCl4 for 6 weeks followed by BS (150 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks; and CCl4 + Silymarin-treated: CCl4 for 6 weeks followed by Silymarin (100 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Blood and kidney tissue were utilized to assess oxidative stress status, inflammatory cytokines, and histopathological changes. Results: BS treatment ameliorated signs of renal damage and fibrosis as it improved renal antioxidant status and renal function markers and significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 along with the fibrogenic marker TGF-β. Kidney tissues showed improved histological features after BS treatment. Conclusions: BS gum resin extract has significant therapeutic potential against CCl4-induced renal damage and fibrosis. These effects could be mediated via its previously reported antioxidant, free radical scavenging, and anti-inflammatory effects."

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a novel Boswellia serrata and Curcuma longa combination (CL20192) for the treatment of CLBP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants with CLBP were randomised to receive either a 300 mg CL20192 capsule (n = 45) or placebo capsule (n = 45) once daily for 90 days. Efficacy was evaluated using the Descriptor Differential Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores for pain, unpleasantness, and disability. Additionally, the 36-item short form questionnaire was used for QoL evaluation. Frequency of painkiller use, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers (tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), and phytoconstituents (total boswellic acids and curcuminoids) were determined. Therapy satisfaction was assessed using the Physician and Patient Global Assessment Scales. RESULTS: All randomised participants completed the study. CL20192 supplementation significantly reduced Descriptor Differential Scale pain, unpleasantness, and Oswestry Disability Index scores compared with the placebo group (p < 0.001 for all parameters). Critical QoL scores greatly improved in the CL20192 group. Serum phytoconstituent levels were elevated in the CL20192-treated group. This group demonstrated a significant reduction in inflammatory biomarker levels (tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), confirming efficacy in abating CLBP compared with the placebo. Moreover, therapy satisfaction scores were significantly high in the CL20192-treated group, and intervention with CL20192 was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Intervention with 300 mg CL20192 capsules, containing a novel combination of Boswellia serrata and Curcuma longa extracts, effectively alleviated pain, unpleasantness, and disability in patients with CLBP compared with the placebo. This outcome was consistent with a decrease in serum inflammatory markers and improved therapy assessment scores.",

Acmella oleracea, known for its spilanthol content, and Boswellia serrata, rich in boswellic acids, have been explored for their potential analgesic properties in pain management. In this study, vulvodynia-like symptoms were induced in female mice using Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). After the induction of symptoms, the mice were treated with a combination of Acmella oleracea and Boswellia serrata extracts (AO + BS). Behavioral pain assessments were conducted to monitor the effects of the treatment. Additionally, biochemical and functional evaluations were performed to measure spinal microgliosis and neuronal overexcitation. The combination of Acmella oleracea and Boswellia serrata (AO + BS) resulted in a significant reduction of vulvar hypersensitivity in mice. Besides alleviating pain, AO + BS therapy also reduced spinal microgliosis and neuronal overexcitation in mice with vulvodynia. The findings suggest that the AO + BS combination has the potential to alleviate vulvodynia associated pain through mechanisms involving the reduction of spinal microgliosis and neuronal overexcitation. These results point to the therapeutic promise of these plant extracts for chronic pain conditions like vulvodynia. The combination of Acmella oleracea and Boswellia serrata shows potential as a treatment for vulvodynia. However, further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and to optimize the dosage for clinical use."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Small bowel dysbiosis (SBD) is a frequent finding in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The sunflower lecithin (phytosome) formulation of Curcuma longa and Boswellia serrata demonstrated beneficial effects on intestinal microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a lecithin-based delivery formulation of Curcuma longa and Boswellia serrata extracts (CUBO) on SBD in IBS subjects. SUBJECTS: Forty-nine adult subjects with IBS and SBD were randomly supplemented for 30 days with CUBO and a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) (intervention) or with LFD and placebo (control group). RESULTS: The intervention group showed a significant reduction in urinary indican (p < 0.001), which was the marker of SBD, and of abdominal bloating (p < 0.001) and abdominal pain (p < 0.001). The pre-post control group analysis did not evidence significant differences. The comparison between the two groups (net effect in intervention minus control subjects) showed that the changes differ significantly for urinary indican p < 0.001 (-42.88; 95% CI: -62.04 to -23.72), abdominal bloating p < 0.001 (-1.50; 95% CI: -1.93 to -1.07), and abdominal pain p < 0.001 (-2.37; 95% CI: -3.61 to -1.13) and for the global assessment of efficacy (p < 0.001). The efficacy was 20% greater in males than in females. CONCLUSIONS: In IBS subjects, the intervention with CUBO and LFD shows a significantly higher reduction in SBD, abdominal pain, and bloating compared to LFD and placebo. Additional research is needed to confirm these data."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress injury in osteoblasts is one of the leading causes of periprosthetic osteolysis (PPOL). Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellia acid (AKBA) has been used as an antioxidant in the treatment of various diseases, but its antioxidant mechanism in osteolysis has yet to be elucidated. In this study, a mouse cranial osteolysis model was constructed, and MC3T3-E1 cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured in vitro. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining revealed that titanium (Ti) particles aggravated osteoblast oxidative stress injury and apoptosis. Ti particles and hydrogen peroxide reduced the osteogenic ability of BMSCs. At a certain concentration, AKBA alleviated the oxidative stress injury of MC3T3-E1 cells induced by Ti particles and enhanced the osteogenic ability of BMSCs, and the expression of Forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) increased with increasing AKBA concentration. To verify the antioxidant mechanism of AKBA, we designed and synthesized Foxo3-targeting siRNAs. We found that after Foxo3 expression was inhibited, the protective effect of AKBA on osteoblasts decreased significantly. Moreover, AKBA treatment suppressed bone mass loss in the skull mediated by Ti particles in mice. Therefore, we suggest that AKBA alleviates the oxidative stress injury in osteoblasts induced by Ti particles, at least in part, by regulating the expression of Foxo3. In this study, the mechanism and biosafety of AKBA in treating PPOL were demonstrated to some extent.",

Frankincense, an oleo-gum resin from the Boswellia sacra tree, has demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. This study explored the synergistic potential of nanoparticles formulated from Boswellia sacra methanolic extract (BME), to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Cp at reduced doses. Nanoparticles were prepared via the nanoprecipitation method, loaded with Cp, and coated with positively charged chitosan (CS) for enhanced cell interaction, yielding Cp@CS/BME NPs with an average size of 160.2 ± 4.6 nm and a zeta potential of 12.7 ± 1.5 mV. In vitro release studies revealed a pH-sensitive release profile, with higher release rates at pH 5.4 than at pH 7.4, highlighting the potential for targeted drug delivery in acidic tumor environments. In vitro studies on HT-29 and Caco-2 colorectal cancer cell lines demonstrated the nanoformulation's ability to significantly increase Cp uptake and cytotoxic activity. Apoptosis assays further confirmed increased induction of cell death with Cp@CS/BME NPs. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that treatment with Cp@CS/BME NPs led to a significant increase in the sub-G1 phase, indicative of enhanced apoptosis, and a marked decrease in the G1-phase population coupled with an increased G2/M-phase arrest in both cell lines. Further gene expression analysis demonstrated a substantial downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic genes Bax, PUMA, and BID following treatment with Cp@CS/BME NPs. Thus, this study presents a promising and innovative strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents using naturally derived ingredients while limiting the side effects."

      "abstract": "The oleo-gum-resin of Boswellia serrata, an Ayurvedic herb for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, contains both volatile (terpenes) and nonvolatile (boswellic acids) molecules as responsible for its bioactivity. The present randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluated the human pharmacokinetics of a 'natural' hybrid-hydrogel formulation of a unique full-spectrum boswellia extract (BFQ-20) (standardized for both volatile and nonvolatile bioactives) in comparison with unformulated extract (U-BE), for the first time. Mass spectrometry coupled with LC (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography (GC-MS/MS) measurements of the plasma concentration of boswellic acids and α-thujene at different post-administration time points followed by a single dose (400 mg) of U-BE and BFQ-20, to healthy volunteers (n = 16), offered 4-fold enhancement in the overall bioavailability of boswellic acids from BFQ-20, [area under the curve (AUC) (BFQ-20) = 9484.17 ± 767.82 ng * h/mL vs. AUC (U-BE) = 2365.87 ± 346.89 ng * h/mL], with the absorption maximum (Tmax) at 6.3 h post-administration and elimination half-life (T1/2) of 15.5 h (p < 0.001). While plasma α-thujene was not detectable upon U-BE administration, BFQ-20 provided significant absorption, [AUC (BFQ-20): 298.60 ± 35.48 ng * h/mL; Cmax: 68.80 ± 18.60 ng/mL; Tmax: 4.12 ± 0.38 h; T1/2: 16.24 ± 1.12 h]. Further investigation of the anti-inflammatory effect revealed 70.5% inhibition of paw edema in rats compared to 38.0% for U-BE. In summary, the natural self-emulsifying reversible hybrid-hydrogel (N'SERH) formulation of boswellia extract using fenugreek mucilage (FenuMat®) significantly increased the solubility (58-fold), stability, and bioavailability of both the volatile and non-volatile bioactives which in turn improved the anti-inflammatory efficacy of Boswellia extract.",

More than 40% of patients use complementary and alternative medicine including supplements containing phytoextracts with anti-inflammatory properties as those from the Boswellia genus. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of phytoextracts from the oleogum resin of the Boswellia genus as supplementation for patients affected by knee OA. Four electronic databases were used for the research and PRISMA statements were followed throughout the study. The following inclusion criteria were used: (a) the subjects of the study were humans with a diagnosis of knee OA reported by medical staff; (b) randomization and the presence of control (placebo, negative or positive control), and (c) outcomes reported with WOMAC and/or visual analog scale (VAS) score. Publication bias was assessed with a funnel plot and through the Egger test. The Jadad scale was used in order to assess the quality of the studies included. The statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. Results of meta-analysis and subgroup analysis were reported using a forest plot. A total of 13 studies involving 850 (WOMAC) and 1185 (VAS) patients met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis did not detect a significant effect of the use of Boswellia extracts between the control and the treatment groups due to the high heterogeneity of the studies (p = 0.0865 for WOMAC) and (p = 0.3966 VAS). However, the subsequent subgroup analysis demonstrated the significant beneficial effect of Boswellia extracts in the treatment of knee OA with respect to a placebo (lower WOMAC score in the treatment groups). This was also confirmed in the meta-regression applied to the WOMAC scores. This is an important finding as people exposed to NSAID-related adverse effects could benefit from the use of Boswellia extracts. However, further high-quality studies are needed to establish the clinical efficacy of extracts from the genus Boswellia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder requiring the administration of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medicines. Although metformin is a popular prescription for type 2 diabetes, long-term use of chemotherapy-based diabetes medications can be hazardous. As a result, novel plant medicines with a high concentration of bioactive molecules, no harmful side effects, and potent pharmacological effects must be found. Edible Boswellia sacra (B. sacra) Flueck oleo-gum resin is widely utilized to treat many clinical diseases in traditional Arab, Chinese, African, and Ayurvedic medicine. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic benefits of several B. sacra oleo-gum resin extracts on rat streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia (Type II). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 29 days, hyperglycemic rats are given either metformin (the reference drug; 250 mg/kg body weight per day) or several B. sacra extracts (ethanol, methanol, hydrodistilled, ethyl acetate, and acetone extracts) at doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. Blood glucose levels and body weights were measured before the initiation and at 7, 11, 16, 22, and 29 days after oral treatment. Furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized, and blood samples were obtained to evaluate cytokines (interleukin (IL-)2 and IL-8), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and serum insulin levels. The pancreas and liver tissues were rapidly excised, washed, fixed, and kept in a 10% formalin buffer for histological examination. RESULTS: B. sacra's ethanolic extract had the greatest concentration of total pentacyclic triterpenic acid (PTA) (391.52 mg/g) in comparison to the other extracts. The lower dose of B. sacra ethanol extract, 200 mg/kg/day, reduces blood glucose levels more efficiently than the higher dose of 400 mg/kg/day. In a 180-min OGTT, diabetic rats given ethanol extract (200 mg/kg) performed no better than control rats and even outperformed those given the reference medication metformin. Additionally, ethanol extract (200 mg/kg)- or metformin-treated diabetic rats gained weight. This was associated with a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8, a reduction in oxidative stress as evidenced by a significant (p < 0.05) increase in SOD and GSH compared to the untreated diabetic group, and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in serum insulin levels compared to normal plasma rat levels. These discoveries, which were eventually confirmed by histochemical assays, indicated that the ethanol extract of B. sacra greatly enhanced the cellular architecture of pancreatic and liver cells. CONCLUSION: The present investigation indicates that the ethanol extract of B. sacra oleo-gum resin, which contains a high proportion of acetyl-β-boswellic acid (β-ABA) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), possesses antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties for the first time to our knowledge. Additionally, it restores hepatic cells in STZ-induced diabetic rats and protects the pancreas against oxidative damage. Thus, the current study's results give a scientific rationale for the use of B. sacra in the medical management of diabetes and associated complications. More investigation into the metabolic profiles of these extracts must be conducted to establish the precise mechanism of action of the ethanol extract."

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at two doses of BSE to understand its safety and efficacy in supporting joint health and improving mobility and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. METHODS: Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 105 newly diagnosed participants with degenerative hypertrophy OA were recruited and randomized into Placebo, BSE-150 mg or BSE-300 mg (n = 35 in each group) to receive either 150 mg or 300 mg BSE or a placebo tablet twice a day for 90 days. All the participants were evaluated for pain and physical function using the standard tools including the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Lequesne Functional Index (LFI), EuroQol- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) quality of life, 6-min walk test at day 0, days 5, 30, 60 and 90 of treatment. Additionally, the circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were evaluated. Safety was evaluated by blood biochemical, hematological analysis, urinary analyses and by monitoring adverse events throughout the study. RESULTS: Ninety-eight subjects completed the study. Improvements in pain scores were observed as early as 5 days after the start of the supplement in the BSE-150 and BSE-300 groups. By 90 days, the VAS pain score reduced by 45.3% and 61.9%, WOMAC- total score improved by 68.5% and 73.6% in the BSE-150 and BSE-300 groups respectively. WOMAC pain (70.2%, 73.9%, WOMAC stiffness (65.6%,68.9%), WOMAC function (68.8%,74.2%), LFI severity (50%,53.3%), decreased and EQ5D (56.9%, 62.9%) and distance walked in 6 minutes (21.2%, 21.9%) improved in the BSE-150 and BSE-300 groups in 90 days. Further, the levels of TNFα, hs-CRP, and IL-6 were found to decrease in the serum in BSE-supplemented participants. No significant adverse events were recorded during the study. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that Boswellin® Super can be used as a safe and effective supplement to support joint health and mobility in the management of osteoarthritis.

      "abstract": "Boswellia carterii (BC) resins plants have a long historical background as a treatment for inflammation, as indicated by information originating from multiple countries. Twenty-seven diterpenoids have been identified in ethyl acetate and total methanol BC, comprising seventeen boscartins of the cembrane-type diterpenoids and ten boscartols of the prenylaromadendrane-type diterpenoids. Moreover, twenty-one known triterpenoids have also been found, encompassing nine tirucallane-type, six ursane-type, four oleanane-type, and two lupane-type. The cembrane-type diterpenoids hold a significant position in pharmaceutical chemistry and related industries due to their captivating biological characteristics and promising pharmacological potentials. Extraction of BC, creation and assessment of nano sponges loaded with either B. carterii plant extract or DEX, are the subjects of our current investigation. With the use of ultrasound-assisted synthesis, nano sponges were produced. The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of medications in nano sponges was examined using spectrophotometry. Nano sponges were characterized using a number of methods. Within nano sponges, the EE% of medicines varied between 98.52 ± 0.07 and 99.64 ± 1.40%. The nano sponges' particle sizes varied from 105.9 ± 15.9 to 166.8 ± 26.3 nm. Drugs released from nano sponges using the Korsmeyer-Peppas concept. In respiratory distressed rats, the effects of BC plant extract, DEX salt and their nano formulations (D1, D5, P1 and P1), were tested. Treatment significantly reduced ICAM-1, LTB4, and ILβ 4 levels and improved histopathologic profiles, when compared to the positive control group. Boswellia extract and its nano sponge formulation P1 showed promising therapeutic effects. The effect of P1 may be due to synergism between both the extract and the formulation. This effect was achieved by blocking both ICAM-1 and LTB4 pathways, therefore counteracting the effects of talc powder.",

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion accompanied by hyponatremia, seizures, and rhabdomyolysis as a manifestation of Boswellia serrata intoxication has not been reported previously. A 38-year-old female suffered clinically isolated syndrome and has since been regularly taking B. serrata capsules (200mg/d) to strengthen her immune system. She experienced hypersensitivity to light, ocular pain, nausea, dizziness, and lower limb weakness four days after receiving her first BNT162b2 vaccine dose, and she increased the dosage of B. serrata to five capsules (1000mg/d) one week after vaccination. After taking B. serrata at a dosage of 1000mg/d for 3 weeks, she was admitted to the intensive care unit because of a first, unprovoked generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient's workup revealed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, which resolved completely upon treatment and discontinuation of B. serrata. In summary, B. serrata potentially causes syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion when it is taken at high doses. Patients should not self-medicate.",

      "abstract": "Trismus is a common, extremely detrimental side effect following definitive radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies. Existing therapeutic modalities (active and passive range-of-motion exercises and systemic therapies) offer only modest, slow improvements in jaw opening; thus, there is a need for additional treatment options. Boswellia serrata (BS) (\"Indian frankincense\") is a tree native to West Asia and North Africa that produces resin-containing \"boswellic\" acids. These have been shown to have in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects and have previously been found to be an effective treatment for asthma, colitis, arthritis, and post-radiation edema. Herein we report the case of a 54-year-old male with severe post-radiation trismus who experienced a dramatic resolution with BS/Therabite® combination therapy. His trismus improved from 6 mm to 45 mm over 10 weeks (0.46 mm/day), far exceeding previous rates of improvement documented in the literature. There were no ill effects. Given the dearth of effective treatments for post-radiation trismus, BS is a promising agent deserving of further study."

Boswellia serrata extract has been shown to have anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. Periodontitis is an oral chronic inflammatory disease that affects nearly half of the US population. We investigated the antimicrobial effects of B. serrata extract on two oral pathogens associated with periodontitis. Using the minimum inhibitory concentration and crystal violet staining methods, we demonstrated that Porphyromonas gingivalis growth and biofilm formation were impaired by treatment with B. serrata extracts. However, the effects on Fusobacterium nucleatum growth and biofilm formation were not significant. Using quantification of colony-forming units and microscopy techniques, we also showed that concentrations of B. serrata that were not toxic for host cells decreased intracellular P. gingivalis infection in human gingival epithelial cells. Our results show antimicrobial activity of a natural product extracted from Boswellia trees (B. serrata) against periodontopathogens. Thus, B. serrata has the potential for preventing and/or treating periodontal diseases. Future studies will identify the molecular components of B. serrata extracts responsible for the beneficial effects."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a widespread chronic degenerative disease marked by the deterioration of articular cartilage, modifications in subchondral bone, and a spectrum of symptoms, including pain, stiffness, and disability. Ultimately, this condition impairs the patient's quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of standardized Boswellia serrata gum resin extract (BSRE) in a rat model of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis. A total of 60 rats were allocated into six groups: normal control group (NC), osteoarthritis control (injected with MIA, OC), O + B50 (injected with MIA and treated with 50 mg/kg body weight (BW) BSRE), O + B75 (injected with MIA and treated with 75 mg/kg BW BSRE), O + B100 (injected with MIA and treated with 100 mg/kg BW BSRE), and O + M (injected with MIA and treated with 150 mg/kg BW methyl sulfonyl methane). Several parameters, including knee joint swelling, histopathological changes, and the expression of collagen type II alpha 1 (COL2A1) and aggrecan, were comprehensively assessed. Concurrently, the serum levels and mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were analyzed in both the serum and knee joint synovium. The results demonstrated that BSRE significantly mitigated knee joint swelling, cartilage destruction, and tissue deformation. Notably, BSRE administration markedly upregulated the expression of COL2A1 and aggrecan while concurrently reducing levels of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Furthermore, a substantial decrease was observed in the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-lipoxygenase, IL-6, TNF-α and MMP-3 and -13, thereby indicating promising therapeutic implications for osteoarthritis. In conclusion, BSRE exhibited anti-inflammatory properties and inhibited cartilage matrix degradation in a rat model of MIA-induced osteoarthritis, with the O + B100 group showing significant reductions in swelling and notable improvements in joint cartilage damage. These findings illuminate the preventive and therapeutic potential of BSRE for osteoarthritis treatment, emphasizing the criticality of exhaustive evaluation of novel compounds.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the leading worldwide public health problems. It is characterized by hyperglycemia which induces oxidative stress and inflammation, both involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. We previously showed that Boswellia dalzielii (BD) and Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) extracts reduced hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. In the present study, we evaluated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of both plants in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Two sets of experiments were conducted in male Wistar rats subjected to a single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan monohydrate (150 mg/kg, b. w.). Then, diabetic rats were daily administered with either BD (1st set of experiments) or HS (2nd set of experiments) at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg orally for 21 consecutive days. Glibenclamide (10 mg/kg) was also administered as a reference drug. At the end of the study, the animals were anesthetized, and blood samples were collected from each animal. Then, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in the serum were determined. We found that treatment with BD and HS significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhanced the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). These extracts also significantly decreased the inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). From the results obtained, it can therefore be concluded that BD and HS have the potential to being developed as natural sources of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents that can be used for the prevention or treatment of DM."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease characterized by pain, inflammation, and physical disability. Boswellia serrata (BS) is widely studied for its effectiveness in OA condition. Our systematic review and meta-analysis study was aimed to evaluate BS extract efficacy in OA. A sub-group analysis was performed to compare the efficacy of a standardized BS extract (AflapinⓇ) with other BS extracts. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials, identified from three online databases, evaluating the effect of BS extracts in OA were included. Quality of studies was assessed using PEDro scale and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Pooled effect was reported as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval. Study was conducted as per the Cochrane guidelines (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42023411356). RESULTS: Nine RCTs with 712 participants were included. All studies (except one) were good quality studies. BS supplementation significantly reduced VAS (MD: -10.71; p<0.00001), LFI (MD: -2.99; p<0.00001), WOMAC-pain (MD: -10.69; p<0.0001), WOMAC-stiffness (MD: -5.49; p<0.00001), and WOMAC-function (MD: -10.69; p<0.00001) scores compared to control therapy. By sub-group analysis, AflapinⓇ supplementation showed greater reduction in VAS (MD: -16.09 vs -4.68), LFI (MD: -3.81 vs -2.01), WOMAC-pain (MD: -18.68 vs -7.07), WOMAC-stiffness (MD: -14.25 vs -3.78), and WOMAC-function (MD: -14.99 vs -8.41) scores as compared to other BS therapies. CONCLUSIONS: BS supplementation is effective OA symptomatic management. Sub-group analysis revealed that AflapinⓇ supplementation may be better in improving the symptoms of OA which needs to be confirmed by more comparative clinical studies.",

New treatment targets for TBI are being explored because current medicines are frequently ineffectual and poorly tolerated. There is increasing evidence that following TBI, there are widespread changes in autophagy-related proteins in both experimental and clinical settings. The current study investigated if Boswellia Sacra Gum Resin (BSR) treatment (500 mg/kg) could modulate post-TBI neuronal autophagy and protein expression, as well as whether BSR could markedly improve functional recovery in a mouse model of TBI. Taken together our results shows for the first time that BSR limits histological alteration, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant, cytokines release and autophagic flux alteration induced by TBI."

      "abstract": "Contemporary agriculture heavily relies on pesticides for pest eradication and disease management. Consequently, current study was carried out to assess the acaricidal/antifungal efficacy of emulsifiable concentrate (10 % EC) derived from Boswellia carterii (B. carterii) against adult females of Tetranychus urticae (T. urticae), and five fungal pathogens. The meticulous examination of the chemical constitution of the crude extracts derived from the resin of B. carterii was conducted through the employment of the venerable technique known as Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLC). The formulated petroleum-ether extract (FPEE) and formulated ethyl-acetate extract (FEAE) of B. carterii at a concentration of 10 mg ml-1 exhibited notable antioxidant activity with rates of 62.0 % and 90.8 %, respectively. In vitro, the FEAE exhibited potent inhibition against all the tested phytopathogenic fungi at different concentrations, whereas FPEE showed comparatively less efficacy. Interestingly, at 4000 ppm concentration, FEAE completely ceased the mycelial growth compared with the control. Moreover, following a span of 72 h of intervention, FPEE exhibited a greater degree of toxicity towards mature females of the T. urticae. This was evidenced by the LC50 value of 422.52 parts per million (ppm) for FPEE, which surpassed the LC50 value of 539.50 ppm observed for FEAE. In summary, the present study indicates that B. carterii resin formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate (10 % EC) can offer a natural and effective alternative for integrated pest management, thereby reducing reliance on synthetic pesticides and offering a more environmentally sustainable strategy for pest control."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by hippocampal, and cortical neuron deterioration, oxidative stress, and severe cognitive dysfunction. Aluminum is a neurotoxin inducer for cognitive impairments associated with AD. The treatment approaches for AD are unsatisfactory. Boswellia papyrifera and Syzygium aromaticum are known for their pharmacological assets, including antioxidant activity. Therefore, the current study explored the possible mitigating effects of a combination of Boswellia papyrifera and Syzygium aromaticum against aluminum chloride (AlCl3) induced AD. The AD model was established using AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), and the rats were orally administrated with Boswellia papyrifera or Syzygium aromaticum or a combination of them daily for 8 weeks. The Y-maze test was used to test cognition in the rats, while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and oxidative stress markers were estimated in homogenates of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Also, the histopathological examination of the cortex and hippocampus were investigated. The results revealed that administration of either B. papyrifera or S. aromaticum extracts significantly improved the cognitive functions of AD rats, enhanced AChE levels, increased oxidative enzymes levels, including SOD and GSH, and reduced MDA levels in homogenates of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and confirmed by improvement in histological examination. However, using a combination therapy gave better results compared to a single treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided primary evidence for using a combination of B. papyrifera and S. aromaticum to treat cognitive dysfunction associated with AlCl3 Induced AD by improving the AChE levels and modulating oxidative stress in the brain.",

The participants were advised to take two softgels of 500 mg as a single dose of allocated study intervention (total dose 1000 mg) when their menstrual pain reached 5 or more on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Menstrual cramp pain intensity and relief were evaluated every 30 min post-dose until 6 h. Results indicated a promising role of turmeric-boswellia-sesame formulation for menstrual pain relief compared to the placebo. The mean total pain relief (TOTPAR) of the treatment group (18.9 ± 0.56) was found to be 12.6 times better than the placebo group (1.5 ± 0.39). The NRS analysis showed that there was a statistically significant difference in pain intensity between the treatment and placebo groups (p < 0.001) at every timepoint.

Traditional therapy with steroids and antibiotics presents risks and benefits and the new drugs, i.e., monoclonal antibody, are valid solutions despite being quite expensive. Natural molecules could be a valid treatment that combines good efficacy and low price. We conducted a case -control study to evaluate the benefit of an oral supplement with Ribes nigrum, Boswellia serrata, Bromelain and Vitamin D on chronic sinusitis symptoms. 60 patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: control using nasal steroids only, treatment 1 using nasal steroid and 1 dose of the oral supplement for 30 days and treatment 2 in which patients used nasal steroid and two oral supplement doses daily for 15 days. Conditions of the nasal mucosa and a blood sample (WBC, IgE and CRP) were analyzed at T0, T1 (15 days after treatment) and T2 (30 days after treatment. Patients treated with the supplement improved their nasal findings (hyperemia of mucosa and rhinorrhea) with statistically significant differences from the control. Our preliminary data suggest that the addition of supplement containing Ribes nigrum, Boswellia serrata, Vitamin D and Bromelain to the traditional local therapy (nasal spray with cortisone) can be a supporting therapy to modulate the local inflammation in the nose in patients affected by chronic sinusitis."

Recent investigations have shown that inflammation and oxidative stress play a central role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac injury pathophysiology. Gum-resin extracts of Boswellia serrata have been traditionally used in folk medicine for centuries to treat various chronic inflammatory diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of B. serrata pretreatment on LPS-induced cardiac damage in H9c2 cells. The cells were pretreated with various concentrations of B. serrata (5-45 μg/ml) for 24 h and then stimulated with LPS (10 μg/ml) for another 24 h. Afterward, the levels of cell viability, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, prostaglandin (PGE)-2, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real time-PCR or appropriated biochemical methods. Our results demonstrated that LPS treatment caused a remarkable decrease in cell viability and GSH, and on the contrary, it led to a significant increase in the levels of gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers and NO. However, pretreatment of B. serrata (5, 15, and 45 μg/ml) decreased the levels of TNF-α, PGE2, IL-1β, COX-2, iNOS, IL-6, and NO production, while cell viability and GSH levels were increased. Taken together, our results demonstrated that B. serrata might be a potential therapeutic agent against LPS and endotoxemia-induced cardiac injury, through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.",

      "abstract": "This investigation explored the impact of dietary frankincense resin oil (FO) on growth performance parameters, intestinal histomorphology, fatty acid composition of the breast muscle, and the immune status of broilers. We allotted 400, three-day-old, male chicks (Ross 308 broiler) into four treatment groups (ten replicates/group; ten chicks/replicate). They were fed a basal diet with different concentrations of FO (0, 200, 400, and 600 mg kg-1). FO supplementation increased the overall body weight (BW) and body weight gain (BWG) by different amounts, linearly improving the feed conversion ratio with the in-supplementation level. Total feed intake (TFI) was not affected. Growth hormones and total serum protein levels also linearly increased with the FO level, while albumin was elevated in the FO600 group. Moreover, total globulins increased linearly in FO400 and FO600 treatment groups. Thyroxin hormone (T3 and T4) levels increased in all FO treatment groups without affecting glucose and leptin serum values. Different concentrations of FO supplementation in the diet increased the activities of Complement 3, lysozyme, and interleukin 10 levels in the serum. Dietary FO in broilers increased the total percentage of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. It also increased the ratio of n-3 to n-6 linearly and quadratically. Additionally, FO supplementation led to the upregulation of immune clusters of differentiation 3 and 20 (CD3 and CD20) in the spleen, along with improving most of the morphometric measures of the small intestine. In conclusion, FO up to 600 mg kg-1 as a feed additive in broiler chicken production is valuable for promoting their growth, intestinal histomorphology, and immune status along with enriching breast muscle with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As a chronic joint condition, osteoarthritis (OA) is a common problem among older people. Pain, aching, stiffness, swelling, decreased flexibility, reduced function, and disability are the symptoms of arthritis. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we tested the extracts of Ziziphus jujuba (ZJE) and Boswellia serrata (BSE) to reduce OA symptoms as an alternative treatment. METHODS: NMRI mice were administered an intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA; 1 mg/10 mL) in the left knee joint cavity for the induction of OA. Hydroalcoholic extracts of ZJE (250 and 500 mg/kg), BSE (100 and 200 mg/kg), and combined ZJE and BSE were orally administered daily for 21 days. Following behavioral tests, plasma samples were collected to detect inflammatory factors. To screen for general toxicity, acute oral toxicity was evaluated. RESULTS: Oral administration of all the hydroalcoholic extracts significantly increased the locomotor activity, pixel values of the foot-print area, paw withdrawal threshold, the latency of the withdrawal response to heat stimulation, and decreased the difference between pixel values of hind limbs compared to the vehicle group. Also, the elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were reduced. As tested in this study, ZJE and BSE were practically nontoxic and had a high degree of safety. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the oral administration of ZJE and BSE slows the progression of OA through anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties. Oral co-administration of ZJE and BSE extracts can be used as herbal medicine to inhibit OA progression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Burn wounds rank among the most serious healthcare issues. Many studies reported the effectiveness of natural products in the wound-healing process. The present study compared the effects of a standardized herbal formulation derived from Boswellia carteri (B. carteri) and silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream 1% on the healing of burn wounds. METHODS: This randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted at Shiraz Burn Hospital (Shiraz, Iran) between July 2012 to August 2013. A sterilized formulation comprising B. carteri 40% was prepared. 54 second-degree burn patients of both sexes with age ranges of 20 to 60 were invited to participate in this double-blind, randomized clinical trial. They were randomly divided into two groups and given either the Boswellia formulation or SSD cream. The healing index was determined based on the wound area assessment using the planimetry technique. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess the primary outcome, which was the amount of time until complete healing. RESULTS: The trial was completed by 17 patients from the SSD group and 15 patients from the Boswellia group. During the study period, both groups showed a progressive healing trend. The mean (95% CI) healing time in the SSD group was 10.94 (9.03-12.85) days and 10.73 (9.23-12.23) days in the Boswellia group (P=0.71), indicating no significant difference. On the 17th day, the healing index of all patients in the Boswellia group reached 1. CONCLUSION: Boswellia topical formulation had a burn wound healing effect comparable to that of the standard SSD 1% treatment. Based on the findings of this study, the likelihood of contact dermatitis with Boswellia should be taken into consideration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse radiation effects (AREs) can occur after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and symptomatic cases are often treated with corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and vitamin E. The supplement 5-Loxin (Boswellia serrata) is an extract of Indian frankincense that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor expression and has been shown to reduce perilesional edema in brain tumor patients undergoing fractionated radiation. OBSERVATIONS: Three patients underwent SRS for meningioma or metastasis and developed symptomatic AREs at 4 to 8 months. They were initially treated with corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and vitamin E with transient improvement followed by recurrent neurological symptoms and imaging findings as steroids were tapered off. All patients were rescued by the administration of 5-Loxin with resolution of neurological symptoms and imaging changes, discontinuation of steroids, and no medication side effects. LESSONS: The author's early experience with 5-Loxin has been encouraging, and this supplement has become the author's first-line treatment for acute radiation effects after SRS. The author reserves bevacizumab for significant mass effect or failure of oral therapy. 5-Loxin has many advantages including low cost, ease of use, and patient tolerability. More experience is needed to confirm the role of 5-Loxin in the upfront treatment of AREs."

METHODS: Patients with mTBI were asked about memory impairment following the injury. One hundred mTBI patients were visited and assessed using an auditory-visual learning test (AVLT) questionnaire. By using random permuted blocks, patients were given the Memoral (a mixture of 360 mg of Boswellia and 36 mg of ginger) or placebo and were asked to consume it for a month. Patients were assessed one and three months afterward using the second and third steps of AVLT, respectively. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included in the study and divided into control and intervention groups. The mean age of the patients was 36.83±14.71, and there were no significant differences between the two groups (p=0.41). There were no statistically significant differences in the baseline scores of different AVLT parameters between the two groups. All patients had improvements in different parameters after three months. But some factors include the scores' change in total learning, retroactive interference score, forgetting rate, and net positive score were significantly higher in treatment groups at one-month and three-month follow-ups compared to the placebo group. In contrast, word span and hit parameters had the same pattern of improvement in both groups. CONCLUSION: The herbal medication can have a satisfactory effect on eliminating post-mTBI memory dysfunction while having no considerable adverse effects. The effect of these components can also be sustained after a two-month timeframe. These results may assist patients to have less mental involvement."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a Curcuma longa and Boswellia serrata food supplement in addition to standard care on hand pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This open-label, non-controlled, post-observational study was based on 232 patients suffering from hand pain with or without joint deformity. Patients received a medical prescription for a three-month treatment with a food supplement containing 89 mg of C. longa dry extract, 120 mg of B. serrata resin, and 1.8 µg vitamin D. Pain was evaluated on a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). The number of painful hand joints, patient satisfaction, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs intake, and side effects were also recorded. RESULTS: Baseline pain intensity (regression coefficient ± SE: -0.19 ± 0.01, p < 0.0001) and the number of painful joints (regression coefficient ± SE: -0.022 ± 0.0029, p < 0.0001) decreased significantly throughout the 3 months treatment period. NSAIDs intake and topical drug application were significantly decreased by 64% (p < 0.0001) and 79% (p < 0.0001) after 12 weeks, respectively. Only 3/239 (1.3%) patients reported side effects probably related to the product. 80.3% were satisfied with the treatment and 75.5% wished to continue treatment. CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical trial showing that C. longa and B. serrata resin can relieve symptoms in patients with hand osteoarthritis. The study provides useful information for the design of a clinical trial including a broader population.",

Oxidative stress as well as inflammatory and immune responses play important roles in the development of myocarditis. Presently, more research has been carried out on anti-inflammatory treatment using natural compounds. The aim was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of Boswellia gum resin extract in an experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) and the involvement of molecular pathways. Rats were immunized with porcine cardiac myosin to ascertain EAM. The EAM rats were treated orally with Boswellia extract or vehicle for 21 days. EAM caused macroscopic and microscopic alterations with necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis of the heart tissues, as well as clinical biochemical changes, cytokines release, altered immune response, and oxidative stress. Oral treatment with Boswellia markedly reduced myocardial damage, decreased inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis, biochemical markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase and the creatine kinase, and heart weight/body weight ratio. In addition, low nitric oxide and malondialdehyde levels together with the upregulation of antioxidant nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 NRF-2 pathway were observed in EAM rats treated with Boswellia. Thus, Boswellia could be considered as a new natural extract to combat heart pathologies, such as autoimmune myocarditis."

At a societal level, it also has a high economic burden. Boswellia serrata has been reported to have potent anti-inflammatory, antiarthritic, and analgesic effects. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic potential and possible underlying mechanism of 5-Loxin®, a standardized Boswellia serrata extract, in a rat model of OA. The OA model was established by the intra-articular injection of 50 μL of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) (60 mg/mL). 5-Loxin® was administered orally, and efficacy was evaluated through serum analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), histologic staining, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Results indicated that administration of 5-Loxin® can relieve OA joint pain through inhibition of both inflammatory processes and cartilage degeneration. In the group of rats treated with 5-Loxin®, the suppression of inflammatory enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) resulted in a significant reduction in the prostaglandin (PG) E2 and leukotriene (LT) B4 levels. Moreover, 5-Loxin® ameliorated the deterioration of the main components of the articular extracellular matrix (ECM), such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and aggrecan, through the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These findings suggest that 5-Loxin® may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of OA."

The present study aimed to assess the antibacterial effect and phagocytic ability of the aqueous extract of the Boswellia serrata in bacteria isolated in nosocomial infections. Boswellia carterii plant was collected and prepared from the aqueous extract in different concentrations. A total of 125 samples were collected from various clinical sources, including urine, sputum, wounds, otitis, and blood, from patients of both genders in different age groups. The results demonstrated that out of the 59 infected samples, urine samples had the highest infection (68%), followed by wounds, sputum, and otitis reported as (60%), (44%), and (40%), respectively. On the other hand, blood samples had the lowest percentage of infection (28%). Microscopic diagnostic results, biochemical tests, API Staph System, API 20E System, and Vitek 2 Compact pointed out that the highest infection rates were related to Staphylococcus aureus (32.20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.33%), and Escherichia coli (22.03%), while the lowest infection rate was detected in Klebsiella pneumonia (20.33%). The results indicated that aqueous extract of Boswellia carterii had an antibacterial activity for all bacterial isolates, 25 mg/ml of extract gave an inhibition zone of 10.8 mm,10.4 mm, 7mm, and 10mm for S. aureus, E. coli, P aeruginosa, and K. pneumonia, respectively, while 200 mg/ml of extract gave 24 mm, 22 mm, 18.4 mm, and 20 mm, respectively. The results pointed to a significant increase in the phagocytosis rate, with the phagocytosis of blood samples treated with Boswellia carterii extract (79.7%), as compared to control samples (57.75%). As evidenced by the results of this study, the aqueous extract of the Boswellia carterii plant showed antibacterial effects and a positive impact on the phagocytic ratio; nonetheless, it is recommended that further studies be conducted to characterize the compounds of this herb.",

Turmeric (Curcuma longa) and boswellia (Boswellia serrata) extracts are well-studied anti-inflammatory compounds gaining in popularity and used as an alternative to conventional treatments for musculoskeletal pain. This study analyzed the analgesic effect of a formulation of turmeric and boswellia extracts in sesame oil (Rhuleave-K, TBF) in reducing exercise-induced acute musculoskeletal pain in healthy participants. METHODS: In this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled, single-dose, single-day, multicentre study, a total of 232 participants (TBF n = 116; placebo n = 116) having moderate-to-severe exercise-induced acute musculoskeletal pain were randomized in an allocation concealed 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 1000 mg of TBF or placebo. The outcome measures were numerical rating scale (NRS), categorical pain relief scale (PRS), onset of analgesia, and short form of McGill questionnaire (SF-MPQ). NRS and PRS were measured from predose to every 30 minutes interval of postdose up to 6 hours at rest, with movement and applying pressure on the affected part. The onset of analgesia was measured from the time of dosage and censored at 6 hours of postdose. The sum of pain intensity difference (SPID6) and total pain relief (TOTPAR6) at 6 hours was, respectively, analyzed from NRS and PRS scores. RESULTS: TBF showed a significant reduction in pain intensity (SPID6rest) with 97.85% improvement in cumulative responder analysis compared with 2.46% in placebo. The onset of pain relief was fast and highly significant in the TBF group with 99% of participants having a mean perceptible pain relief at 68.5 minutes (95% confidence interval, 59.5-77.4) and 96% of participants having a mean meaningful pain relief at 191.6 minutes (95% confidence interval, 176.7-206.4) compared to the placebo group. Highly significant and continuous improvement in pain relief was observed in the TBF group with 93% of participants having ≥ 50% of maximum TOTPAR6 with a number needed to treat of 1.1 at rest. CONCLUSION: Exercise-induced acute musculoskeletal pain can be effectively relieved by TBF (Rhuleave-K) in about 3 hours signifying its strong analgesic activity.",

The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate their mechanisms of action at therapeutic plasmatic concentrations on primary human osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes. Methods: BS (10-50 μg/ml) and CL (0.4-2 μg/ml corresponding to 1-5 µM of curcumin) were evaluated separately or in combination on primary chondrocytes isolated from 17 OA patients and cultured in alginate beads. Ten patients were used for RNA-sequencing analysis. Proteomic confirmation was performed either by immunoassays in the culture supernatant or by flow cytometry for cell surface markers after 72 h of treatment. Results: Significant gene expression modifications were already observed after 6 h of treatment at the highest dose of CL (2 μg/ml) while BS was significantly effective only after 24 h of treatment irrespective of the concentration tested. The most over-expressed genes by CL were anti-oxidative, detoxifying, and cytoprotective genes involved in the Nrf2 pathway. Down-regulated genes were principally pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Inversely, BS anti-oxidant/detoxifying activities were related to the activation of Nrf1 and PPARα pathways. BS anti-inflammatory effects were associated with the increase in GDF15, decrease in cholesterol cell intake and fatty acid metabolism-involved genes, and down-regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activation. Similar to CL, BS down-regulated ADAMTS1, 5, and MMP3, 13 genes expression. The combination of both CL and BS was significantly more effective than CL or BS alone on many genes such as IL-6, CCL2, ADAMTS1, and 5. Conclusion: BS and CL have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-catabolic activities, suggesting a protective effect of these extracts on cartilage. Even if they share some mechanism of action, the two extracts act mainly on distinct pathways, and with different time courses, justifying their association to treat osteoarthritis."

      "abstract": "Some nutraceuticals have been studied as supportive treatment for fighting upper respiratory tract infection and middle ear disease. Our study aims at evaluating the effect of a specific oral supplementation in the treatment of pediatric otits media. The subjects were randomly assigned by the physician (single-blinded study) to one of three groups: Control Group (CG), Treatment Group 1 (TG1), or Treatment Group 2 (TG2). Both TG were treated with Flogostop Duo (for 20 days-TG1 or 30 days-TG2) in combination with the standard treatment, while CG underwent standard treatment only. The standard treatment was nasal aerosol with Fluticasone and Mucolytic, and nasal washing with hypertonic solution. All patients were analyzed by otoscopy, impedance, fibroscopy, and pure auditory test at the baseline (T0), after 20 days (T1) and 35 days (T2). 120 children were included in the study, 40 in the CG, 40 in the TG1, and 40 in the TG2. Both TG1 and TG2 presented statistically significant differences with respect to controls in otoscopy, impedance, fibroscopy, and PTA at T2. The otoscopy improved at T2 with statistically significant value only in TG2. The impedance and fibroscopy improved at T1 both in TG1 and TG2 compared to CG. A statistically significant improvement was observed in TG2 at T2 in comparison to both CG and TG1. Statistically significant differences were observed in PTA at T2 only compared with controls. This study confirmed the efficacy of nutraceutical as supporting therapy in the upper respiratory tract infection in children. In particular, the supplement containing Boswellia serrata and Bromelain, which are molecules with strong anti-inflammatory and pain-control capacities, could add the benefit without the adverse effects which are related to NSAID use."

The aims of this research were to study the possible effects of dietary supplementation with Bs and Sa extracts on serum and albumen proteins, zinc and iron, and yolk cholesterol content in Leghorn hens during the critical phase of the onset of laying. A total of 120 pullets, 17 weeks of age, were assigned to two groups (control (C) and treated (T), n = 60 each). The T group received a supplement containing Bs (5%) and Sa (5%) for 12 weeks. The study lasted 19 weeks. Serum proteins were fractionated using agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Trace elements were determined in serum using atomic absorption spectrometry, and yolk cholesterol was determined using a colorimetric test. No significant differences were observed between control and supplemented hens for the analyzed biochemical indices. Moreover, the supplementation with phytoextracts did not negatively affect the physiological variations in serum proteins; therefore, it can be safely used as a treatment to prevent inflammatory states at onset and during the early laying phase."

Fifty teeth were contaminated with a culture of E. faecalis (ATCC 19433) for 21 days. Two teeth were used to confirm the biofilm using scanning electron microscope. For colony-forming unit (CFU), 40 samples were divided into one control group (calcium hydroxide) and the other experimental group (B. sacra). Each group was divided into two subgroups to be tested at 3 and 7 days. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of B. sacra was determined, and the B. sacra's ethanolic extract medicament was prepared. Eight discs divided into groups similar to CFU were used to evaluate live/dead bacteria using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Ten teeth were selected for penetration depth using CLSM. The intracanal medicaments were mixed with 0.1% rhodamine B. were inserted into the root canals 0.2 slices were dissected and viewed under CLSM. The MIC of B. sacra was 1.25 mg/ml. The CFU evaluation proved that B. sacra are more effective than calcium hydroxide in the 3 days groups. However, it was statistically insignificant compared with calcium hydroxide after 7 days. The depth of penetration of B. sacra exceeds that of calcium hydroxide. B. sacra is an effective intracanal medicament.",

In this retrospective study, patients were enrolled and divided into two groups, one undergoing observation (Group A, n 12) and one receiving one sachet a day of Retimix® (Group B, n 49). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were performed at baseline, then at one and six months. A mixed-design ANOVA was calculated to determine whether the change in CMT and BCVA over time differed according to the consumption of Retimix®. The interaction between time and treatment was significant, with F (1.032, 102.168) = 14.416; η2 = 0.127; p < 0.001, indicating that the change in terms of CMT and BCVA over time among groups was significantly different. In conclusion, our results show the efficacy of Curcuma longa and Boswellia serrata in patients with non-proliferative DR and treatment-naïve DME in maintaining baseline CMT and BCVA values over time."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Kundur, Boswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr., is prescribed by Unani (Greco-Arab) scholars clinically under conditions similar to vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and has been supported by recent pharmacological studies, but scientific evidence is scarce. OBJECTIVES: The study intended to investigate the drug's scientific parameters and to compare its efficacy and safety to that of Miconazole nitrate (2% w/w) in treatment of VVC. DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTING: The RCT was performed in the Department of Ilmul Qabalat wa Amraze Niswan at Luqman Unani Medical College Hospital and Research Center in Vijaypura, India, between November 2018 and March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 40 married women, aged 18 to 45 years, who had been clinically examined and diagnosed with VVC. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to the Boswellia serrata (Kundur) group, the intervention group (n = 20), or to the miconazole group, the control group (n = 20). The Kundur group took a one-gram tablet of Kundur as a vaginal insert every day at bedtime for 21 days, while the control group used vaginal suppositories with 100 mg of miconazole (2% w/w) every day at bedtime for seven days. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were changes: (1) in vulval itching (pruritus), (2) in vaginal discharge, (3) in painful urination (dysuria), (4) in recurrent genital pain (dyspareunia), and (5) in quality of life (QoL). The secondary outcome measures were mycological clearing on a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test and a per-speculum pelvic examination for the presence or absence of curdy discharge, vulval erythema, and vulval swelling. RESULTS: The response to the intervention was greater than that of the control in reducing pruritus vulvae and vaginal discharge. However, both drugs were equally effective in improving the rest of the parameters, including QoL. CONCLUSION: The VVC symptoms were equally and significantly improved in both the intervention and the control groups, and Boswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr. was shown to be efficacious in the management of VVC. Further studies with a rigorous design and larger sample size are needed to reinforce scientific evidence.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Boswellia serrate is an ancient and highly valued ayurvedic herb. Its extracts have been used in medicine for centuries to treat a wide variety of chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which B. serrata hydro alcoholic extract inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae with LPS-induced inflammation remained unknown. METHODS: LC-MS analysis was used to investigate the extract's phytochemical components. To determine the toxicity of B. serrata extract, cytotoxicity and embryo toxicity tests were performed. The in-vivo zebrafish larvae model was used to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of B. serrata extract. RESULTS: According to an in silico study using molecular docking and ADMET, the compounds acetyl-11-keto-boswellic and 11-keto-beta-boswellic acid present in the extract had higher binding affinity for the inflammatory specific receptor, and it is predicted to be an orally active molecule. In both in-vitro L6 cells and in-vivo zebrafish larvae, 160 µg/mL concentration of extract caused a high rate of lethality. The extract was found to have a protective effect against LPS-induced inflammation at concentrations ranged between 10 and 80 µg/mL. In zebrafish larvae, 80 µg/mL of treatment significantly lowered the level of intracellular ROS, apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide. Similarly, zebrafish larvae treated with B. serrata extract (80 µg/mL) showed an increased anti-inflammatory activity by lowering inflammatory specific gene expression (iNOS, TNF-α, COX-2, and IL-1). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that B. serrata can act as a potent redox scavenger against LPS-induced inflammation in zebrafish larvae and an inhibitor of specific inflammatory genes.",

The objective of the study was to prospectively evaluate OPERA® (GAMFARMA srl, Milan, Italy), a new dietary supplement where α-Lipoic acid, Boswellia serrata, Methylsulfonylmethane and Bromelain are combined in a single hard-gelatin capsule to be taken once a day. Fifty-three patients with arthralgia (NCI-CTCAE v4.0 grade ≥ 1) occurring during AI therapy were enrolled. All patients received OPERA® from enrollment (T0) up to sixth months (T3). Patients' AI-related arthralgia was evaluated every two months with VAS Scale, PRAI questionnaire, and CTCAE scale. Primary endpoint was the number of patients with symptom resolution (G0) at T3 if compared to T0, according to CTCAE and VAS scale. Secondary endpoints were decrease in arthralgia intensity measured with PRAI score at T3 compared to baseline, safety of OPERA® and rate of AI interruption. Treatment with OPERA® supplement was overall well tolerated; no relevant toxicities related to OPERA® intake were reported. Seven subjects (13.2%) were not included in the final analysis because of consent withdrawal. 46 participants were eligible for final analysis. According to CTCAE scale, 10 out of 46 patients reported symptoms resolution at 6-month follow-up from the time of enrollment T0 (p = 0.0009). According to VAS score, 5 patients reported complete resolution of symptoms at T3 if compared to baseline starting situation T0 (p = 0.0222). Analysis of PRAI score showed a significant reduction in arthralgia-related pain perceived (p = 0.0001). OPERA® was able to reduce the intensity of arthralgia related to AI therapy.

Boswellia serrata could be active in the treatment of acute diarrhea due to its anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and antimicrobial activity. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 49 adults with acute diarrhea were randomly allocated to receive 250 mg of a lecithin-based delivery form of Boswellia serrata (CASP) or placebo for 5 days. The time it took to become healthy with stoppage of diarrhea (primary end point) was significantly shorter in the intervention group (3.08 vs. 4.44 days: p-value < 0.0001). The probability of subjects treated with CASP to recover sooner was equal to 80.2%. A significantly lower number of stools was observed in the CASP group over time (β = −0.17, p-value < 0.0001). A significant difference was observed between the two groups for abdominal pain, nausea, and GAE (global assessment of efficacy). In conclusion, the lecithin-based delivery form of Boswellia serrata extract could be a useful addition to the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults. CASP is safe and reduces the time it takes to become healthy, the frequency of stools, the abdominal pain and nausea of subjects with acute diarrhea. Further studies are needed to confirm these promising results.",

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial confirms the efficacy of Aflapin in ameliorating the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. METHODS: Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, seventy subjects were recruited and randomized into Placebo (n = 35) and Aflapin (n = 35) groups. Subjects received either 100 mg Aflapin or a placebo for 30 days. All subjects were evaluated for pain and physical function using the standard tools i.e., Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Lequesne Functional Index (LFI), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at the baseline (Day 0), 5, and 30 days of treatment. Additionally, several inflammatory and cartilage biomarkers, including matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP), and collagen type II cleavage (C2C) were evaluated. Total blood chemistry analyses were conducted to affirm the safety of Aflapin. RESULTS: Sixty-seven subjects completed the study. Aflapin conferred significant improvements in pain scores as early as five days of treatment. Post-trial, VAS, LFI, WOMAC pain, WOMAC stiffness, WOMAC function, and total WOMAC scores decreased in the Aflapin group by 45%, 40.9%, 44.4%, 66.3%, 44.4%, and 48%, respectively. Aflapin supplementation also reduced circulating MMP-3, TNFα, hsCRP, and C2C. CONCLUSION: This investigation affirms that Aflapin is clinically efficacious, fast-acting, and safe in the management of osteoarthritis. No significant adverse effects were observed.",

Participants were evaluated with National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI), the International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), four-glass test, uroflowmetry, and prostate-specific antigen assessments at baseline and at Week 4, and Week 12. Primary endpoints were improvement in pain domain of NIH-CPSI and improvement of NIH-CPSI total score. Secondary outcomes included improvement of micturition and quality of life (QoL) domains of NIH-CPSI questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 61 males were enrolled. No adverse events were reported. Significant improvements from baseline to Day 30 were reported for NIH-CPSI total score (mean difference: -9.2; p<0.01), NIH-CPSI pain domain (mean difference: -5.5; p<0.01), NIH-CPSI micturition domain, NIH-CPSI QoL domain, and IPSS total score (mean difference: -5.6; p<0.01). No significant changes from baseline in terms of IIEF score or maximum flow rate were observed. At final follow-up (Day 90), further significant improvements in terms of NIH-CPSI total score (mean difference: -12.2; p<0.01), NIH-CPSI pain domain (mean difference: -6.6; p<0.01), NIH-CPSI micturition domain, NIH-CPSI QoL domain, and IPSS total score were reported. CONCLUSION: Rectal administration of Boswellia resin extract and propolis derived polyphenols is well tolerated and delivers a significant symptomatic improvement in most patients with type IIIa and type IIIb CP/CPPS."

TBI can result in neuropsychiatric and cognitive problems as well as neurodegenerative pathologies that can appear right after or develop and persist years after injury. METHOD: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial on patients who suffered from TBI three months to three years ago. The patients were randomized to placebo (n = 34) or K-Vie™ group (n = 46) for a treatment period of 3 months. The main primary outcomes include cognitive assessment in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Recognition Test (RAVLT), Wechsler adult intelligence Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and trail-making test part B (TMT-B). Assessments were performed at baseline and at the month 3 follow-up visit. Linear mixed models were carried out to evaluate cognitive changes from baseline across all cognitive assessment tests. RESULT: The current study showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in cognitive function of patients who were given K-Vie™ compared with placebo across the RAVLT, DSST and TMT-B performance assessments. A larger cohort would be beneficial to further confirm the clinical utility of K-Vie™ and assess its effects in acute phases of TBI.",

Extracts of Curcumalonga and Boswelliaserrata share anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects that could be useful in the management of these clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin and boswellia extracts (as Curcumin Boswellia Phytosome, CBP) and LFD on the relief of abdominal bloating in IBS subjects with small bowel dysbiosis, in comparison to LFD alone, in a 30-day supplementation, randomized trial. IBS participants were randomized to either the intervention (500 mg bid of CBP and LFD) or control arm (LFD). Small bowel dysbiosis has been defined by an increase of urinary indican with normal urinary skatole. A total of 67 subjects were recruited. The intervention group (33 subjects) showed a significant decrease (p < 0.0001) of bloating, abdominal pain, and indican values at the end of the study, when compared to the control group (34 subjects). Moreover, the subjects of the intervention group showed a significantly better (p < 0.0001) global assessment of efficacy (GAE) as compared to controls. In conclusion, in subjects with IBS and small bowel dysbiosis, abdominal bloating can be successfully reduced with a supplementation with CBP and LFD.",

      "abstract": "With the COVID-19 pandemic still wreaking havoc worldwide, new variants being discovered every month in some parts of the globe due to the mutating nature of the virus. There is no specific solution for this highly transmissible disease. In search of a lead molecule for the discovery and development of drug, extensive research is being conducted throughout the world. Many synthetic drugs are already in clinical trials and some are utilized for the treatment of this viral infection. Apart from synthetic drugs, phytocompounds from plants act as a potential drug candidate which can inhibit the growth of virus and thus able to prevent the viral infection. In this study, 26 ligands (bioactive compounds) from Boswellia serrata (an important medicinal plant) were tested against SARS-CoV-2 by using computational method. Selected ligands were shortlisted using Lipinski's rule and then subjected to molecular docking against one of the main proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., Mpro. Out of these compounds, Euphane, Ursane, α-Amyrin, Phytosterols, and 2,3-Dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid were potential to inhibit the Mpro activity with binding energies of - 10.47 kcal/mol, - 10.41 kcal/mol, - 9.99 kcal/mol, - 9.94 kcal/mol and - 9.72 kcal/mol respectively. A comparative study was performed using the best five ligands against four possible drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. It was found that Euphane showed highest negative binding energy against all the four crucial targets of SARS-CoV-2. Further, in-vitro experimentation is required to validate the use of Euphane as a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2."

      "abstract": "Boswellia serrata extracts have been traditionally employed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we have evaluated the mechanism of activity of Boswellin Super® FJ (BSE), a standardized extract of B. serrata containing not less than 30% 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid along with other β-boswellic acids. The in vitro anti-inflammatory activities were carried out in RAW 264.7 macrophages or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and treated with 1.25-5μg/ml BSE. The anti-arthritic activity of the extract was evaluated in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis. BSE at 40 and 80mg/kg and celecoxib 10mg/kg were orally dosed for 21days. BSE showed significant (p<0.05) inhibition of inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6, nitric oxide, and COX-2 secretion) and downregulates the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL1-β, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in macrophages. BSE treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated-NF-κB (P65), suggesting an anti-inflammatory activity mediated by blocking this key signal transduction pathway. In addition, BSE showed inhibition (p<0.05) of collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase enzymes, and a reduction in reactive oxygen species and matrix-degrading proteins in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS. BSE treatment significantly (p<0.05) reduced the arthritic index, paw volume, and joint inflammation comparable to celecoxib in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. The circulating anti-collagen antibodies were reduced in BSE and celecoxib-treated animals as compared to the CIA. In confirmation with in vitro data, BSE showed a significant (p<0.05) dose-dependent effect on C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E2, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which is widely used as a blood marker of inflammation. Further, BSE treatment suppressed the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and significantly enhanced the hyaluronan levels in synovial fluid. As observed by collagen staining in joints, the loss of matrix proteins was lower in BSE-treated animals, suggesting that BSE could preserve the extracellular matrix in RA. The extract showed inhibition of collagenase enzyme activity in vitro, further strengthening this hypothesis. BSE treatment was found to be safe, and rats displayed no abnormal behavior or activities. The results suggest that Boswellin Super® mediates its activity by preserving matrix proteins, reducing pro-inflammatory mediators, and oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "The link between diabetes and cognitive dysfunction has been reported in many recent articles. There is currently no disease-modifying treatment available for cognitive impairment. Boswellia serrata (B. serrata) is used traditionally to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), insulin resistance (IR), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review aims to highlight current research on the potential use of boswellic acids (BAs)/B. serrata extract in T2D and AD. We reviewed the published information through June 2021. Studies have been collected through a search on online electronic databases (Academic libraries as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Egyptian Knowledge Bank). Accumulating evidence in preclinical and small human clinical studies has indicated that BAs/B. serrata extract has potential therapeutic effect in T2D and AD. According to most of the authors, the potential therapeutic effects of BAs/B. serrata extract in T2D and AD can be attributed to immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activity, and elimination of the senescent cells. BAs/B. serrata extract may act by inhibiting the IκB kinase/nuclear transcription factor-κB (IKK/NF-κB) signaling pathway and increasing the formation of selective anti-inflammatory LOX-isoform modulators. In conclusion, BAs/B. serrata extract may have positive therapeutic effects in prevention and therapy of T2D and AD. However, more randomized controlled trials with effective, large populations are needed to show a definitive conclusion about therapeutic efficacy of BAs/B. serrata extract in T2D and AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer. Despite the advancement in treatment, drug resistance remains a major cause for setback. In an earlier work, the authors reported that Boswellia dalzielii (Hutch) stem bark exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity in head and neck cancer cells, AW8507. Therefore, the cell death induction effect of Boswellia dalzielii stem bark chloroform extract in head and neck cancer cell line, AW8507, and its derived constituent on cell cycle and apoptosis proteins was further investigated. METHODS: The cell death induction activity of the Boswellia dalzielii stem bark chloroform fraction (CLBD) in AW8507 was determined using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining in flow cytometry. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed for compounds analysis of the CLBD, and reverse virtual screening was used to identify the mechanism of action of the compound, acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid, that was elucidated in the Boswellia dalzielii chloroform fraction. RESULTS: The data obtained showed that Boswellia dalzielii stem bark Chloroform extract increased the percentage of cells presenting for early apoptosis from 4.14 to 10.10% in AW8507 cells. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the chloroform fraction identified acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid. Reverse virtual screening on selected proteins showed that acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid is a multi-protein target compound. It binds preferably to phosphorylated-cyclin dependent kinase 1 (p-CDK1) (binding score =  - 9.2 kcal/mol), blocking the activation of cyclin B-CDK1 needed for cell cycle progression at G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid also binds more tightly with αβ tubulin (binding score = 8.9 kcal/mol) than with the standard drug, docetaxel (binding score = 8.3 kcal/mol). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained confirmed the culpability of Boswellia dalzielii-derived acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid in the obstruction of the cell cycle progression in head and neck cancer cell line, AW8507; and the induction of apoptosis earlier reported for Boswellia dalzielii (Hutch) stem bark. Additional in vitro and/or in vivo studies would be required to validate in silico observations.",

The phytochemical composition of the volatile components of the extract was identified by GC-MS analysis revealing 49 compounds as trans-nerolidyl formate, cycloartenol acetate, ursenoic acid 3-oxomethyl ester, bisabolene epoxide, and kaur-16-ene. It decreased the growth and increased the leakage of nucleotides in 58.3% and 33.3% of isolates, respectively. Additionally, it reduced the extracellular polysaccharide production and the cell surface hydrophobicity in 41.67% and 50% of the isolates, respectively. Crystal violet assay revealed inhibition of biofilm formation by the tested isolates. Light microscope and scanning electron microscope were used to examine the biofilms and they confirmed the reduction of biofilm formation by frankincense extract. Downregulation of the genes linked to biofilm formation (fimA, hagA, and hagB) was observed using qRT-PCR after treatment with the frankincense extract. This study suggested that the frankincense extract could exhibit antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against P. gingivalis isolates. Thus, the frankincense extract could be used as a treatment approach for periodontitis."

      "abstract": "The emergence of MDR bacterial pathogens has directed antibiotic discovery research towards alternative therapies and traditional medicines. Boswellia sacra oleoresin (frankincense) was used to treat bacterial infections in traditional Arabian and Asian healing systems for at least 1000 years. Despite this, B. sacra extracts have not been rigorously tested for inhibitory activity against gastrointestinal pathogens or bacterial triggers of autoimmune diseases. Solvent extracts were prepared from Boswellia sacra oleoresins obtained from three regions near Salalah, Oman. MIC values were quantified against gastrointestinal pathogens and bacterial triggers of selected autoimmune diseases by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. The antibacterial activity was also evaluated in combination with conventional antibiotics, and the class of interaction was determined by ΣFIC analysis. Isobolograms were used to determine the optimal ratios for synergistic combinations. Toxicity was evaluated by ALA and HDF cell viability bioassays. The phytochemical composition of the volatile components of all extracts was identified by nontargeted GC-MS headspace analysis. All methanolic extracts inhibited the growth of all of the bacteria tested, although the extracts prepared using Najdi oleoresin were generally more potent than the Sahli and Houjari extracts. Combinations of the methanolic B. sacra extracts and conventional antibiotics were significantly more effective in inhibiting the growth of several bacterial pathogens. In total, there were 38 synergistic and 166 additive combinations. Approximately half of the synergistic combinations contained tetracycline. All B. sacra extracts were nontoxic in the ALA and HDF cell viability assays. Nonbiased GC-MS headspace analysis of the methanolic extracts putatively identified a high diversity of monoterpenoids, with particularly high abundances of α-pinene. The antibacterial activity and lack of toxicity of the B. sacra extracts indicate their potential in the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, the extracts potentiated the activity of several conventional antibiotics, indicating that they may contain resistance-modifying compounds."

Its usage should be validated in light of recent findings of haematotoxicity. This study was aimed to determine the effect of chronic administration of standardized methanolic extract of frankincense on blood cell count in experimental animals. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, the active constituents of B. sacra extract; boswellic acids were analyzed. The effect of three different doses of the extract (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) on different blood cells and associated parameters was investigated. The behavior, food, and water consumption of the rats were recorded. Boswellic acids were present in varying amounts with α-boswellic acid and β-boswellic acid present in more amounts compared to other boswellic acids in the extract. All three doses tested had no effect on the animals' behavior, food consumption, or weight gain. The administration of a low (500 mg/kg) and high (1000 mg/kg) dose of the extract resulted in a non-dose dependent reduction in MCH (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), but no other blood parameters were significantly affected. The B. sacra extract produces hypochromic normocytic anemia in rats at higher doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg and this effect was not dose-dependent.",

      "abstract": "Boswellic acid (BA) is a pentacyclic terpenoid derived from the gum-resin of Boswellia serrate. It is known for its strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. It has improved spatial learning and provides neuroprotection against trimethyltin-induced memory impairment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible neuroprotective activity of B. serrata extract (BSE) containing BA against fipronil (FPN)-induced neurobehavioral toxicity in Wister male albino rats. Sixty male rats were allocated equally into six groups. The first group served as control; the second and third groups received BSE at two different oral doses (250 or 500 mg/kg body weight [BW], respectively). The fourth group was orally intoxicated with FPN (20 mg/kg BW), whereas the fifth and sixth groups served as preventive groups and co-treated with FPN (20 mg/kg BW) and BSE (250 or 500 mg/kg BW, respectively). The experiment was conducted over 8 weeks period. Results revealed that co-treatment with BSE led to significant (p > 0.05) dose-dependent reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factors-alpha (TNF-α), nuclear factor Kappa-B (NF-κB), Cyclooxegenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), serotonin, and acetylcholine (ACh). Conversely, significant (p > 0.05) up regulation of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) has reported in BSE-co-treated groups. In addition, significant (p > 0.05) promotion in neurobehaviours, histopathologic imaging of the cerebral, cerebellar, and hippocampal regions, and immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were also reported in the BSE-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, BSE (500 mg/kg BW) is a natural, promising neuroprotective agent that can mitigate FPN-induced neurobehavioral toxicity via the suppression of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic pathways and relieve neuronal necrosis and astrogliosis.",

      "abstract": "Co-therapy with herbal extracts along with current clinical drugs is being increasingly recognized as a useful complementary treatment for cancer. The anti-cancer property of the phyto-derivative acetyl-11 keto β boswellic acid (AKBA) has been studied in many cancers, including prostate cancer. However, the whole extract of the gum resin Boswellia serrata (BS) and anti-androgen enzalutamide has not been explored in prostate cancer to date. We hypothesized that the BS extract containing 30% (AKBA) with enzalutamide acted synergistically in the early phase of cancer, especially in LNCaP cells, by inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) and by reducing cell proliferation, and further, that the extract would be superior to the action of the active ingredient AKBA when used alone or in combination with enzalutamide. To test our hypothesis, we treated LNCaP cells with BS extract or AKBA and enzalutamide both individually and in combination to analyze cell viability under different levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) followed by the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the efflux mechanism of the cells were analyzed to determine the effect of the combination on the cellular mechanism. Cells derived from prostate cancer patients were also tested with the combination. Only 6 µM enzalutamide along with BS in the range of 4.1 µg/ml to 16.4 µg/ml gave the best synergistic results with nearly 50% cell killing even though standard enzalutamide doses were as high as 48 µM. Cell killing was most effective at intermediate DHT concentrations of approximately 1 nM, which corresponds to normal physiological serum levels of DHT. The Pgp expression level and the androgen receptor expression levels were reduced under the combination treatment; the former helping to minimize drug efflux and the latter by reducing the sensitivity to hormonal changes. Furthermore, the combination reduced the PSA level secreted by the cells. In contrast, AKBA could not achieve the needed synergism for adequate cell killing at equivalent concentrations. The combination of enzalutamide and BS extract containing 30% AKBA because of their synergistic interaction is an attractive therapeutic option for treating early stage (hormone-dependent) prostate cancer and is superior to the use of AKBA alone.",

      "abstract": "The influences of Boswellia serrata resin extract (BSRE) as a feed additive on the growth performance, immune response, antioxidant status, and disease resistance of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus L. were assessed. One hundred-forty four fingerlings (initial weight: 21.82 ± 0.48 g) were randomly allotted into four groups with three replicates where they were fed on one of four treatments with four levels of Boswellia serrata resin extract 0, 5, 10, or 15 g kg-1, BSRE0, BSRE5, BSRE10, BSRE15, respectively for eight weeks. After the end of the feeding trial, the fish were challenged with Staphylococcus aureus, and mortalities were noted. The final body weight, total body weight gain, and the total feed intake were quadratically increased in BSRE5 treatment (p < 0.01). The protein productive efficiency (PPE) was linearly and quadratically increased in all BSRE supplemented treatments (p < 0.01). Dietary addition of BSRE raised the fish crude protein content and reduced the fat content in a level-dependent manner (p < 0.01). The ash content was raised in the BSRE15 group (p < 0.01). Dietary BSRE supplementation decreased the serum levels of glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and nitric oxide. It increased the serum levels of total protein, albumin, total globulins, α1 globulin, α2 globulin, ß globulin, ɣ globulin, Catalase, and SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity, GSH (reduced glutathione), lysozyme activity, and MPO (myeloperoxidase) in a level-dependent manner (p < 0.05). The BSRE15 diet increased the serum level of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and decreased creatinine serum level (p < 0.05). Dietary BSRE supplementation increased the relative percentage of survival % (RPS) of S. aureus challenged fish. The histoarchitecture of the gills and kidney was normal in the BSRE5 treatment and moderately changed in BSRE10 and BSRE15 treatments. The splenic lymphoid elements were more prevalent, and the melano-macrophage centers (MMC) were mild to somewhat activated in BSRE supplemented treatments. Dietary BSRE supplementation improved the intestinal histomorphology. It can be concluded that BSRE addition can enhance the antioxidant activity, immune status, and disease resistance of O. niloticus to S. aureus infection. The level of 5 g kg-1 BSRE can improve fish growth without causing harmful effects on fish health. The highest levels of BSRE are not recommended as they badly affected the histoarchitecture of many vital organs."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This observational study evaluated a combination of boswellia, turmeric, and red algae extracts in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Given the growing interest in patient-centered care in osteoarthritis, effects were assessed by an arsenal of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs): Patient Acceptable Symptom Scale (PASS), Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (MCII), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Lequesne algofunctional index (LAFI). Patients also completed a list of 17 items on pain quality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with painful unilateral or bilateral KOA had to take 1-4 capsules per day of a dietary supplement containing boswellia, turmeric, and red algae extracts for 90 days. Patients completed PROMs on Days 0 (baseline), 10, 20, 30, 60, and/or 90. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients [female: 69.5%; age: 62.9 (9.5) years, mean (SD)] were included in the study and took at least one capsule. Mean (SD) follow-up duration was 100.7 (54.9) days. Pain relief was maximal on Day 90: 64.5% of patients were responders (positive PASS); 68.8% and 58.4% had MCII and PGIC scores indicating positive effect (score ≥3) or global improvement (score ≥5); 73.3% (versus 47.5% at baseline) were mildly/moderately disabled (LAFI score <8); 55.2% had meaningful decrease (-30%) in pain intensity (VAS), 35.1% (versus 59.2% at baseline) took analgesics as supplementary treatment. Median time to the first PASS change was 34 days. Pain intensity (VAS), as well as two pain characteristics (ie, \"Stabbing pain\" and \"Widespread pain\"), were independent factors associated with non-response on Day 30. Four clusters of responders were isolated according to pain characteristics, with one cluster exhibiting a higher responder rate. CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary study suggest that the combination of boswellia, turmeric, and red algae extracts tested could improve KOA patients. Beyond these results, this study showed the importance of PROMs and specific pain qualitative descriptors for the accurate evaluation of dietary supplement approaches in painful conditions."

      "abstract": "Boswellic acids, and particularly 11-keto-boswellic acids, triterpenoids derived from the genus Boswellia (Burseraceae), are known for their anti-inflammatory and potential antitumor efficacy. Although boswellic acids generally occur as α-isomers (oleanane type) and β-isomers (ursane type), 11-keto-boswellic acid (KBA) was found only as the β-isomer, β-KBA. Here, the existence and natural occurrence of the respective α-isomer, 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA), is demonstrated for the first time. Initially, α-KBA was synthesized and characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and a highly selective, sensitive, and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed by Design of Experiments (DoE) using a pentafluorophenyl stationary phase. This method allowed the selective quantification of individual 11-keto-boswellic acids and provided evidence for α-KBA in Boswellia spp. oleogum resins. The contents of α-KBA as well as further boswellic acids and the composition of essential oils were used to chemotaxonomically classify 41 Boswellia oleogum resins from 9 different species. Moreover, α-KBA exhibited cytotoxicity against three treatment-resistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in vitro and also induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo. The respective β-isomer and the acetylated form demonstrate higher cytotoxic efficacies against TNBC cells. This provides further insights into the structure-activity relationship of boswellic acids and could support future developments of potential anti-inflammatory and antitumor drugs.",

The aim of this work is to investigate the potential role of a new delivery formulation of the association of curcumin and boswellia phytosome extracts (CBP) in SUDD. METHODS: In a 30-day one-group longitudinal explanatory study, patients (men and women) were treated with an innovative association of CBP standardized extracts, 500 mg bid. RESULTS: Treatment of SUDD with the association of CBP was followed by a significant decrease in abdominal pain (p<0.0001). The study group showed that CBP supplementation was efficacious within 10 days and that efficacy was maintained almost constant until the 30th day of intervention. CONCLUSION: A phytosome of curcumin and boswellia extracts may be useful for the relief of SUDD pain. However, controlled studies should be performed for final conclusions to be drawn."

Patients received a medical prescription for 1-month treatment with two tablets twice a day of a pharmaceutical grade food supplement containing both C. longa and B. serrata extracts. Pain and functional limitation were evaluated using a visual analog scale at the inclusion and 1-month treatment later. Patient satisfaction, concomitant drugs intake and side effects were also recorded.Results: After 1-month treatment, pain and functional limitation were significantly improved whatever the cause of tendinopathy, its localization, and the duration of symptoms. The pain score decreased from 6.16 ± 1.53 to 2.98 ± 1.64 (p < .0001), yielding a drop of 51.6% and the functional limitation score fell after 1-month treatment from 5.96 ± 1.73 to 2.88 ± 1.67 (p < .0001) corresponding to a drop of 51.6%. The percentage of patients taking at least one concomitant treatment at the end of the treatment period had decreased from 81.3% to 61.8% (p < .0001). Only 43 (6.5%) patients reported side effects. No severe adverse effects related to the product were reported.Conclusion: The combination of C. longa and B. serrata extracts improves symptoms in patients suffering of tendinopathy and shows a good safety. Although its effect will have to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials, it can be considered as a helpful support of standard symptomatic treatments for tendinopathies. HighlightsTendinopathy is a common disease representing 30% of all consultations with a general practitioner for musculoskeletal disorders.The combination of Curcuminoids and Boswelliaserrata extracts are efficient on tendinopathy symptoms in support of standard symptomatic treatments.The combination of Curcuminoids and B.

For the treatment of metabolic syndrome, traditional herbal medicines such as frankincense or Boswellia species have been used due to their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-obesity, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and hypolipidemic properties. Based on the literature, published evidence up to 2020 about the therapeutic effects of Boswellia species on the metabolic disorder among Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar were precisely evaluated by keywords such as obesity, diabetes, hyperglycemia, hypertension, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, frankincense, and Boswellia. According to the results, Boswellia species have beneficial effects to control metabolic syndrome and its related disorders such as hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and its complications. Boswellia species by reducing the resistance to insulin and restoring pancreatic beta cells decrease blood glucose. Also, Boswellia species has antithrombotic and anticoagulant properties that regulate blood pressure. The anti-oxidant properties of Boswellia species modulate the blood lipid profile via reducing TNF-α, IL-1β levels, and increasing the adiponectin level. The therapeutic and protective effects of Boswellia species on metabolic disorders were remarkably confirmed regarding decreasing hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity."

      "abstract": "Boswellia papyrifera woodland provides considerable economic, ecological and socio-cultural benefits in the drylands of Ethiopia. However, its populations are in rapid decline due to human pressure and environmental degradation. As a consequence, the species is now considered being endangered, demanding an urgent conservation intervention to sustain its existence. This study was carried out in the Abergele district, northern Ethiopia, with objectives to characterize the current population structure of B. papyrifera and prioritize its potential conservation intervention alternatives using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) modelling techniques. The woody species related data were collected from 33 sample plots randomly established in the study area. Data related to the potential intervention alternatives and their evaluating criteria were collected from experts, personal experiences and intensive literature reviews, and then validated using stakeholders' focus group discussion. Four candidate alternatives were then considered for the AHP: 1) free grazing with no tapping resting period (FGNTR), 2) free grazing with a rotational tapping (FGRT), 3) area exclosure with medium tapping resting period (AEMTR), and 4) area exclosure with long tapping resting period (AELTR). The results showed that the population structure of B. papyrifera is unstable and is characterized by low density (266 trees ha-1), absence of regeneration and saplings (DBH<10 cm) due to different interrelated disturbances such as overgrazing, over tapping, pests, agricultural expansion and poor managements. The overall priority ranking value of all stakeholders using the AHP techniques also indicated that AEMTR (with overall rank value of 0.352) and AELTR (0.294) as the best alternatives strategies, respectively, for sustainable B. papyrifera woodland conservation. For the success of these strategies, their economic impacts at their early implementation stages (5-10 years) should be minimized by collecting different non-timber forest products from the woodland. Continuous capacity building training on sustainable utilizations and managements of B. papyrifera woodland should also be provided for all relevant stakeholders."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) persists to be a major health problem especially among children as effective chemotherapy to combat the disease is yet to be available. Boswellia dalzielii is a well-known herb that is traditionally used for treatment and management of many diseases including degenerative diseases. In this study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized from the phytochemicals of B. dalzielii stem bark aqueous extract. The silver nanoparticles were characterized by carrying out Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Energy Filtered Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction, and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analyses. Antioxidant capacity of the nanoparticles was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and the antiproliferative effect of the nanoparticles on Kasumi-1 leukemia cells was investigated using PrestoBlue assay. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to observe the effect of the nanoparticles on the leukemia cell cycle progression. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the synthesized silver nanoparticles were formed from electrons of the plant phytochemicals which include aromatic compounds, ethers, and alkynes. FESEM analysis revealed that the sizes of the nanoparticles range from 12 nm to 101 nm; however, DLS analysis estimated a larger average size of the nanoparticles (108.3 nm) because it measured the hydrodynamic radii of the nanoparticles. The zeta potential of the nanoparticles was -16 nm, and the XRD pattern of the nanoparticles has distinct peaks at 38.02°, 42.94°, 64.45°, 77.20°, and 81.47°, which is typical of face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of silver. The Trolox Equivalence Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of the nanoparticles was estimated to be 300.91 μM Trolox/mg silver nanoparticles. The nanoparticles inhibited Kasumi-1 cell proliferation. The half minimal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) that inhibited Kasumi-1 cell proliferation are 49.5 μg/ml and 13.25 μg/ml at 48 and 72 hours, respectively. The nanoparticles induced cell cycle arrest in the Kasumi-1 cells at S (5% increase) and G2/M (3% increase) phases. CONCLUSION: The nanoparticles synthesized from the stem bark extract of B. dalzielii inhibit the growth of Kasumi-1 leukemia cells by activating cell cycle arrest; thus, they are potential antileukemic agents."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Persian medicine manuscripts refer to plants such as Commiphora myrrha (Nees) Engl. (myrrh) and Boswellia carteri Birdw. (frankincense), which could be used to improve wound healing process. Since that time, local midwives in Iran continue to provide these herbs to precipitate episiotomy wound healing. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the efficacy and safety of myrrh- and frankincense-based sitz-baths on episiotomy wound healing in primiparous women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 90 primiparous women with singleton pregnancies after normal vaginal delivery at Hafez hospital affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from July to October 2019. Study participants were randomly allocated in three groups (2 intervention groups and 1 control group). Women in intervention groups were assigned to receive either 10-min sitz-bath of myrrh extract or frankincense extract twice a day for 1 week. While the women in control group received the betadine sitz-bath for the same period of time. The main outcome was the episiotomy wound healing, which was measured using the REEDA scale before intervention, on 2nd and 7th postpartum days. RESULTS: An improvement in the episiotomy wound healing was significantly greater in patients receiving myrrh than those receiving the frankincense or betadine on 2nd (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001) and 7th (p = 0.043 and p = 0.015) postpartum days. However, the total REEDA score was not statistically different between the frankincense and betadine groups on 2nd and 7th postpartum days (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that myrrh was more efficient than frankincense and betadine in healing of the episiotomy wound and could be recommended as a safe natural therapy.",

Proximate composition, water holding capacity (WHC), pH, texture profile analysis, sensory evaluation, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), DPPH radical-scavenging activity, volatile basic nitrogen (VBN), and color stability were assessed. Patty VBN gradually increased throughout the storage period. However, VBN for the C treatment increased relatively slowly, indicating that cysteine can delay spoilage and extend the shelf life of patties. The protein content of the whey powder treatment group increased to a greater extent than that of the C and control (CON) groups. Pork patties supplemented with antioxidants showed significantly higher WHC and significantly lower cooking loss and hardness than the CON. Moreover, the addition of 2% whey, 1% B. serrata, and 0.25% cysteine (WBC) significantly enhanced the relative DPPH radical-scavenging activity and sensory characteristics of the patties. After 7-day storage, the MetMb and TBARS values of all treatments were significantly lower than those of the untreated. The results indicated that there was synergy among the cysteine, B. serrata, and whey protein. This finding is of great importance to the production of high-quality pork patties with enhanced shelf life."

      "abstract": "Resins from various Boswellia species have a long track record in different cultures as a treatment for inflammatory diseases. This study was designed to provide evidence for the anti-inflammatory capacity and medicinal use of Boswellia carteri (Burseraceae). A dichloromethane (DCM) extract of B. carteri gum resin and isolated compounds thereof were immunologically characterized. Flow cytometric-based analysis was performed to investigate the impact of B. carteri extract on proliferation, viability, and function of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 activated human primary T cells. The secretion level of IL-2 and IFN-γ was determined by a bead array-based flow cytometric technique. HPLC-based activity profiling of the B. carteri extract identified active compounds. The impact of B. carteri extract and isolated compounds on the IL-2 transcription factor activity was addressed using specially designed Jurkat reporter cells. The extract of B. carteri suppressed the proliferation of human primary T lymphocytes in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, without inducing cytotoxicity. Thereby, the B. carteri extract further reduced the degranulation capacity and cytokine secretion of stimulated human T cells. Transcription factor analysis showed that the immunosuppressive effects of the extract are based on specific NFAT-conditioned suppression within T cell signaling. Through HPLC-based activity profiling of the extract, 3-O-acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid was identified as the compound responsible for the NFAT-based mechanism. The recent study presents a scientific base for the immunosuppressive effects of B. carteri gum resin extract including a mode-of-action via the NFAT-conditioned suppression of T lymphocyte proliferation. The immunosuppressive effects of 3-O-acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid are depicted for the first time.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, the impact of a combination of four memory-enhancer herbs on cognitive impairment and brain tissue oxidative damage due to hypothyroidism was evaluated. Propylthiouracil (PTU; 0.05%) was administrated in drinking water. Rats were treated with a combination of four herbal products (Cyperus rotundus, Crocus sativus, Piper nigrum, and Boswellia serrata) mixed with honey at two doses (640 and 1,280 mg/kg) or donepezil (0.5 mg/kg), for 6 weeks. Memory performance on the Morris water maze (MWM) and avoidance behavior in passive avoidance was impaired by hypothyroidism, and brain tissue oxidative damage occurred. Herbal combination and donepezil significantly improved memory impairment, reduced malondialdehyde concentration, and nitric oxide metabolites while increased the thiol contents and catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes activity in the brain. Our findings suggest that the mixture of herbal products improves learning and memory deficits caused by hypothyroidism, probably by reducing the brain tissue oxidative damage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Learning and memory impairment is a common feature of thyroid hormones deficiency. Several studies are showing that hypothyroidism in juvenile and mature rats induces significant cognitive impairment. Likewise, in humans, a close relationship between thyroid hormone deficiency and cognitive impairment has been reported. We used a mixture of herbal products, including Cyperus rotundus, Crocus sativus, Piper nigrum, and Boswellia serrata, to treat hypothyroidism-induced memory impairment. All these herbs are widely used as a food additive across the world. In Iranian traditional medicine, this herbal combination traditionally used to treat cognitive impairments. Numerous studies have indicated that these herbs show neuroprotective and memory-enhancing properties. Our finding indicated that a traditionally used herbal combination could potentially use as a treatment of cognitive impairment induced by thyroid hormone deficiency.",

To overcome the hydrophilicity of the BNC, the water in its network was exchanged by single and double nanoemulsions. Incorporation of the Boswellia serrata extract in the nanoemulsions formed particles of about 115 to 150 nm with negative zeta potential and storage stability over 30 days at temperatures between 4 and 32 °C. Their loading into the BNC did not change the preferential characteristics of the nanocellulose like water absorption and retention, softness, and pressure stability in a relevant way. Loaded BNC could be sterilized by an electron-beam procedure. A biphasic drug release profile of lead compounds was observed by Franz cell diffusion test. The biocompatibility of the loaded BNC was confirmed ex ovo by a shell-less hen's egg test. Tape stripping experiments using porcine skin determined a dependency of the drug penetration into skin on the type of nanoemulsion, single vs. repeated applications and the incubation time. In conclusion, the hydrophilicity of BNC could be overcome using nanoemulsions which offers the possibility for the anti-inflammatory skin treatment with Boswellia serrata extract.",

Boswellia serrata was considered as a potent anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and analgesic agent that may be a drug for OA. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, data from randomized controlled trials were obtained to assess the effects of Boswellia or its extract versus placebo or western medicine in patients with OA. The primary outcomes included visual analogue score (VAS), WOMAC pain, WOMAC stiffness, WOMAC function and lequesne index. RESULT: Seven trials involving 545 patients were included. Compared with the control group, Boswellia and its extract may relieve the pain [VAS: (WMD -8.33; 95% CI -11.19, - 5.46; P<0.00001); WOMAC pain: (WMD -14.22; 95% CI -22.34, - 6.09; P = 0. 0006)] and stiffness [WOMAC stiffness: (WMD -10.04; 95% CI -15.86, - 4.22; P = 0. 0007)], and improve the joint's function [WOMAC function: (WMD -10.75; 95% CI -15.06, - 6.43; P<0. 00001); lequesne index: (WMD -2.27; 95% CI -3.08, - 1.45; P<0. 00001)]. CONCLUSION: Based on current evidence, Boswellia and its extract may be an effective and safe treatment option for patient with OA, and the recommended duration of treatment with Boswellia and its extract is at least 4 weeks.",

It was previously demonstrated that the treatment with Boswellia serrata gum resin of LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults) patients decreased blood levels of IA2 antibodies, one of the markers associated with LADA autoimmune diabetes. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test whether Boswellia serrata gum resin also influences GAD65 autoantibodies as the other marker associated with LADA. METHODS/DESIGN: We report a case study of male patient diagnosed with LADA with positive GAD65 autoantibodies who was treated with extract from Boswellia serrata gum resin, during 9 months. Blood levels of GAD65 autoantibodies, fasting blood glucose levels and HbA1c were measured before the treatment and periodically during the treatment. RESULTS: Over the observed period, the blood levels of GAD65 autoantibodies linearly decreased about 25%. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that extract of Boswellia serrata gum resin seems to prevent insulitis in patients with LADA, as indicated by its action on both markers of autoimmune diabetes, i.e., GAD65 and IA2 autoantibodies. The possibility that the treatment with boswellic acids of LADA patients with positive autoantibodies could be beneficial on the course of the disease, calls for further investigation and a clinical study.",

Boswellia ovalifoliolata is a medicinal plant known for its many medicinal properties including diabetes. In this background our study was aimed to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of stem bark of Boswellia ovalifoliolata (AESBBO) on antidiabetic and glycoprotein metabolism. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin at a dose of 50 mg/kg bw. After induction of diabetes rats were treated with AESBBO at dosage of 200 mg/kg for a long term treatment of 40 days. Finally, by the end of study all the rats were dissected blood, liver, and kidney tissue samples were collected to investigate the long term effects of AESBBO on diabetes and glycoprotein metabolism. RESULTS: Treatment with AESBBO significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose levels whereas the levels of insulin and hemoglobin were increased with decreased levels of glycosylated hemoglobin. The long term treatment of AESBBO significantly decreased the levels of plasma, liver and kidney tissue glycoproteins such as fucose, hexose, hexosamine and sialic acid. CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that the aqueous extract of stem bark of Boswellia ovalifoliolata possesses a protective role on abnormal glycoprotein metabolism in addition to its antihyperglycemic activity."

Subjects were randomized to receive SLBSP capsule+BSE Placebo or BSE tablet+SLBSP placebo for two months. Patients were allowed to take rescue analgesics (Acelofenac 100 mg). Improvement in pain and function was assessed utilizing WOMAC, VAS. Level of CTX-II in urine and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ was measured initially and at end of treatment. Results and conclusions Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) and Visual Analog Scale score improved markedly in SLBSP as well as in BSE arm (p < 0.05). Difference in VAS and WOMAC scores between the two arms was not statistically significant. Most significant effect was observed in the need for rescue analgesics. SLBSP caused marked lowering of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels whereas a several fold increase was noted in the BSE arm (p < 0.05). Both groups showed marked improvement in pain, SLBSP being superior to BSE with respect to reducing the need for rescue analgesics in addition to modulating inflammatory cytokines.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by progressive loss of neurons, share common mechanisms such as apoptotic cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Genus Boswellia is a genus in the Burseraceae family. It comprises several species traditionally used for treatment of chronic inﬂammatory diseases, cerebral edema, chronic pain syndrome, gastrointestinal diseases, tumors, as well as enhancing intelligence. Many studies have been carried out to discover therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, and concomitant cognitive deficits. However, no curative treatment has been developed. This paper provides an overview of evidence about the potential of the Boswellia species and their main constituents, boswellic acids, as modulators of several mechanisms involved in the pathology of the neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro, animal, and clinical studies have confirmed that Boswellia species contain bioactive components that may enhance cognitive activity and protect against neurodegeneration. They exert the beneficial effects via targeting multiple pathological causes by antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiamyloidogenic, and anti-apoptotic properties. The Boswellia species, having neuroprotective potential, makes them a promising candidate to cure or prevent the neurodegenerative disorders."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Frankincense (Boswellia sacra Fluck.,) is a widely used herbal drug and household medicine for treatment of several diseases. Earlier toxicological studies revealed its proulcerogenic effect and no significant hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic effects in rats. However, some other members of Boswellia species such as Boswellia papyrifera (Caill. ex Delile) Hochst and Boswellia carterii have been reported for testicular toxicity in rats. AIM OF THE STUDY: Testicular toxicity of standardized methanolic extract of B. sacra oleo gum resin was determined through repeated oral dose administration for 28 days. Biochemical, histological and genetic changes in rat testes were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: B. sacra extract was analyzed for its boswellic acid content by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The extract was administered at three different doses to rats. Effect on behavior, weight, food and water consumption along with changes in serum testosterone levels and cytoarchitecture of testis, epididymis and adrenal gland were determined. Gene expression of GSTPi, IGFBP3 and HSP70 in testis was also studied. RESULTS: Boswellic acids (α and β) were present in highest concentration whereas acetyl-11-keto beta boswellic acid was present in relatively smaller amounts. The extract did not produce any significant change in the behavior of the animals, food/water consumption or weight gain. Serum testosterone levels were significantly decreased only by highest tested dose of Boswellia extract (1000 mg/kg, p.o). Histological examination did not reveal any variation in the structure of testis, adrenal gland and epididymis after administration of the extract while the expression of all three studied genes was significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that B. sacra extract does not possess any toxic effect on testis. On the contrary, decrease in gene expression of GSTPi, IGFBP3 and HSP70 revealed its antioxidant potential that may protect testes against effect of toxicants. However, a significant reduction in serum testosterone levels point to mechanisms other than direct testicular toxicity.",

The aim of the study was to assess the effect of different levels of Boswellia serrata resin (BSR) supplementation in broiler chicken diet on fatty acid profiles in tissues and meat quality (physicochemical properties). The experimental Ross 308 broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 4 dietary treatments with 5 cages per treatment. The dietary treatments applied for 6 wk consisted of the control (C) and supplementation with 1.5 (BSR1.5), 2 (BSR2), or 2.5% (BSR2.5) of BSR resin. All the diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. The BSR supplementation had a positive effect (P < 0.05) on the share of polyunsaturated fatty acid in the sum of total fatty acids in breast and drumstick muscles and abdominal fat. In addition, the following dietary parameters of the meat were improved: n-3/n-6, saturation, atherogenic and thrombogenic indices, and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio. The addition of BSR to the broiler chicken diets increased linearly (C vs. BSR, P < 0.05) the physicochemical properties of the breast and drumstick muscles: water-holding capacity and cooking losses. The color parameter a* decreased linearly (P = 0.033) in the breast muscles of the BSR-treated broiler chickens (8.6 and 7.8% C vs. BSR2 and BSR 2.5).",

Four groups consisting of eight rats each were designated: Group I, normal healthy control; group II, CCl4-induced liver fibrosis; group III, CCl4-induced liver fibrosis followed by BS treatment daily for two weeks; and group IV, CCl4-induced liver fibrosis followed by silymarin treatment daily for two weeks. Expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were assessed, in addition to histopathological and fibrotic changes in liver tissues isolated from the rats. BS significantly ameliorated CCl4-induced increases in serum aspartate (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities in addition to restoring total bilirubin, triglyceride and albumin levels. BS treatment also alleviated oxidative stress and improved total antioxidant capacity in the liver, and reduced the expression of TNF-α, NF-κB, TGF-β, IL-6 and COX-2. On a histopathological level, BS treatment also exhibited antifibrotic activity. In conclusion, these findings suggest that BS contains potentially hepatoprotective effects against CCl4-induced liver injury via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic characteristics."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Purified fractions from a Boswellia serrata Roxb. Ex. Colebr. (Burseraceae) extract (ETOH and DCM) contain biologically active compounds that are well known for having inflammation inhibitory properties. In this work, the purified fractions were tested in-vitro for LTC4, LTA4 and COX-2 activities using ELISA and qPCR was performed to determine gene regulation in human leukemia (HL-60) Cells. Two D-imaging tomography was performed to determine the anti-inflammatory activities of the fractions in BALB/c mouse model of lung inflammation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate anti-inflammatory activities of bioactive compounds of Boswellia serrata purified fractions. METHODS: In-vitro MTT assay was performed in HL-60 cell lines for measuring the toxicity/ viability of the cells. ELISA tests were performed for evaluating LTA4, LTC4 and COX-2 activities. qPCR was performed to evaluate the expression of mRNA in HL-60 cells. In-vivo experiments were performed in OVA sensitized and challenged BALB/c mice at two doses of Boswellia serrata purified fraction containing 6% Boswellic acid of 50 and 100mg/kg body weight were given orally and the standard drug dexamethasone (DXA, 4 mg/kg body weight) and reduction in lung inflammation was assessed by using an IVIS Xenogen in-vivo fluorescence imaging system. RESULTS: A purified fraction of Boswellia serrata ETOH extracts reduced leukotriene-C4-synthase activity by 52%, leuktotriene-A4-hydrolase activity by 22% and COX-2 activity by 99% with an IC50 of 12.5μg/ml. Intragastric administration of the purified fraction of Boswellia serrata at two doses of 50mg/kg b.w. and 100mg/kg b.w., respectively along with 2-3% HPMC resulted in a ~51% (P value <0.01) reduction in OVA induced lung inflammation in BALB/c mice as observed by imaging tomography. Treatment of the OVA challenged mice with standard drug dexamethasone (DXA) reduced inflammation by ~66% with significant value (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The present study describes that Boswellia serrata ethanolic extracts purified fraction (ETOH-BS) possess significant anti-inflammatory activities in HL-60 and in BALB/c and further supports for its use as Ayurvedic medicines traditionally in the treatment of lung disorders including allergy and asthma.",

Many patients report genitourinary pain and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms as a main complaint. Many different pharmacological or behavioural therapies are prescribed in daily clinical practice, but efficacy data are still lacking. The aim of our study was to test the efficacy and safety of a transrectal delivered association of Boswellia resin extract and propolis derived polyphenols for the relief of prostatitis - like symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients affected by chronic/recurrent prostatitis - like symptoms were prospectively enrolled in our study from December, 2016 to December, 2018. Patients were screened at baseline through clinical examination and validated questionnaires administration: Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18; prostatitis symptoms persisting for at least 3 of the last 6 months; CPSI pain domain score ≥ 5; previous negative Meares-Stamey test. Treatment consisted on the administration of 1 suppository containing Boswellia resin extract and propolis derived polyphenols, once a day for 20 days. The primary endpoint of the study was the improvement of quality of life after treatment, defined by a reduction of ≥ 2 points, or ≥ 25%, of mean CPSI pain domain score, compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints were the improvement of post-treatment CPSI total score and the analysis of treatment - related adverse events. All patients were re-evaluated 1 month after treatment. RESULTS: 40 patients were enrolled in our study. Median age (Inter - Quartile Range IQR) was 51.5 (41.5-63.2) years. Mean baseline CPSI scores were: 22.15 (total score), 9.67 (pain domain), 5.15 (micturition domain) and 7.35 (quality of life domain), respectively. No significant adverse events were reported. At 1 month follow-up, CPSI scores appeared modified as follows: 16.40 (total score, p = 0.001); 6.92 (pain domain; p = 0.001; 4.02 (micturition domain, p = 0.09); 5.45 (quality of life domain, p = 0.002). Mean CPSI pain domain score reduction was -2.75 points (-28.5%). Mean CPSI total score reduction was -5.75 points (-26%). CONCLUSIONS: The association of Boswellia resin extract and propolis derived polyphenols can reduce genitourinary pain and then improve quality of life of men affected by bothersome prostatitis - like symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The oleo gum resin of Boswellia sacra Fleuck. (Burseraceae) is widely consumed for treatment of several diseases and disorders. To determine the effect of repeated administration of this resin on liver and kidney functions, three different doses of standardized methanolic extract were administered orally to rats for 28 days. Apart from histological studies and determination of biomarkers of hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, other parameters of sub-chronic toxicity such as behavioral change, food consumption and change in body weight were assessed. The extract contained about 36.91% of total boswellic acids; of which 11-keto beta boswellic acid, acetyl-11-keto beta boswellic acid, boswellic acids (α and β) and acetyl boswellic acid (α and β) were found to be 5.81%, 1.91%, 21.92% and 7.27% respectively. Oral administration of the extract for 28 consecutive days did not show any sign of behavioral toxicity and did not affect food consumption or weight gain significantly. Determination of biomarkers of hepatic and nephrotoxicity revealed that extract was safe at the tested doses as it did not produce any significant change in the studied biomarkers except producing a dose dependent increase in serum total protein levels. The histological examination supported biochemical findings. To conclude, methanolic extract of Boswellia sacra doen not produce any significant toxicity to liver and kidney up to doses of 100 mg/kg body weight. The results contradict earlier reports that members of boswellia species produce organ toxicity in rats."

Boswellia serrata extract, curcumin, pine bark extract and methylsulfonylmethane have been identified as having the largest effects for symptomatic relief in a systematic review. It is important to understand whether any pharmacokinetic interactions are among the major constituents of these supplements so as to provide information when considering the combination use of these supplements. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the constituents alone and in combination. METHODS: This study was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, four-treatment, four-period, crossover study with 1-week washout. The pharmacokinetics of the constituents of these supplements when dosed in combination with methylsulfonylmethane were compared to being administered alone. Plasma samples were obtained over 24 h from 16 healthy participants. Eight major constituents were analysed using a validated ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. KEY FINDINGS: The pharmacokinetics of each constituent was characterized, and there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of the constituents when administered as a combination, relative to the constituents when administered alone (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that interactions between the major constituents of this supplement combination are unlikely and therefore could be investigated to manage patients with osteoarthritis without significant concerns for possible pharmacokinetic interactions.",

Aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Proxelan® monotherapy on pain symptoms of patients with chronic prostatitis (CP) or chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) in a prospective pilot study. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients with CP/CPPS symptoms younger than 50, without urinary obstruction, total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <4 ng/mL, negative microbiology testing on prostate fluid and urethral swab, naïve from other treatments during the previous three months were enrolled in a pilot study. IPSS and NIH-CPSI questionnaires were administered to all the patients. Patients could choose to be investigated regarding semen quality and IL6/IL8 seminal markers for inflammatory disease prior and after the therapy course. Proxelan® suppositories were prescribed for each patient for a month with a daily dosage of 1 suppository at bed-time. The primary endpoint of the study included at least a 30% reduction of pain symptoms because similar results can be obtained in each previously investigated placebo group. Effects on semen parameters such as leukocytospermia, spermatozoa concentration and motility, cytokine levels were considered as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Subjective pain relief was obtained in all the patients with significant decrease of NIH-CPSI pain items (P=0.04). Urinary symptoms, investigated by IPSS questionnaire, decreased significantly (P=0.04) as well as quality of life items (P=0.04). Leukocytospermia was found in 5/15 patients available for further investigations. IL6 decreased by 11.55% one month after the treatment while sperm motility resulted increased by 17.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Proxelan® monotherapy may represents a promising valid alternative to combined treatment with antibiotics in patients with CP/CPPS symptoms although the results obtained should be investigated in randomized controlled trials.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a common canine disease frequently treated with nutritional supplements that often lack independent verification of ingredients, active ingredient concentration, efficacy, or safety. Human supplements containing Boswellia serrata extracts (BSE) with high concentrations of active constituents 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) and 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) are bioavailable, safe, and efficacious in the alleviation of symptoms of naturally occurring osteoarthritis in people. Thus, oral AKBA and/or KBA supplementation could be a promising novel therapy for dogs with osteoarthritis. The primary objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of AKBA and KBA within six human and seven canine market formulations containing BSE administered to dogs, using a derivation of the previously validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The secondary objective was to compare measured concentrations to label claims. RESULTS: The mean concentrations of AKBA and KBA within the formulations tested were 42.3 mg/g AF (0.1-155.7 mg/g AF) and 5.2 mg/g AF (0-24.8 mg/g AF), respectively, with four of the formulations containing an undetectable amount of KBA. None of the market formulations had a label claim for KBA. For the five tested formulations with a label claim for AKBA, the mean percentage of detected AKBA was 173% of the concentration listed on the label (range: 114-224%). Formulations claiming to contain AKBA had a mean AKBA concentration of 98.2 mg/g AF, significantly higher than formulations claiming only to contain BSE (7.4 mg/g AF; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a large variation of boswellic acid concentrations in market formulations claiming to contain BSE, with products claiming to contain AKBA containing higher concentrations of AKBA than other products. There was also a large variation in, and overall high, percent difference between label claims and measured concentrations of AKBA. All products met or exceeded label claims. However, differences between label amounts and detected concentrations confirm the need for independent laboratories to quantify concentrations of active ingredients in supplements containing BSE. This would be necessary prior to the use of these formulations in the research or clinical setting.",

      "abstract": "Pentacyclic triterpenic acids from oleogum resins of Boswellia species are of considerable therapeutic interest. Yet, their pharmaceutical development is hampered by uncertainties regarding botanical identification and the complexity of triterpenic acid mixtures. Here, a highly sensitive, selective, and accurate method for the simultaneous quantification of eight boswellic and lupeolic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed. The method was applied to the comparative analysis of 41 oleogum resins of the species B. sacra, B. dalzielli, B. papyrifera, B. serrata, B. carterii, B. neglecta, B. rivae, B. frereana, and B. occulta. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data revealed differences in the triterpenic acid composition that could be assigned to distinct Boswellia species and to their geographic growth location. Extracts of the oleogum resins exhibited cytotoxicity against the human, treatment-resistant, metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Extracts from B. sacra were the most potent ones with an average IC50 of 8.3 ± 0.6 µg/mL. The oleogum resin of the B. sacra was further fractionated to enrich different groups of substances. The cytotoxic efficacy against the cancer cells correlates positively with the contents of pentacyclic triterpenic acids in Boswellia extracts.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Boswellia serrata oleo-gum resin (frankincense) exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects against several diseases, such as; asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the current study, the influences of B. serrata resin extract on motor dysfunction and oxidative stress markers were investigated in the intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of Parkinson's disease (PD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals were randomly assigned to sham, lesion (6-OHDA), and three lesion groups treated with ethyl alcoholic extract of B. serrata at doses of 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg for 3 weeks. The neurotoxin 6-OHDA (12.5 µg) was microinjected into the left striatum to induce PD in male rats. Motor behavior was assessed by rotational and elevated narrow beam tests. Oxidative stress markers were measured in striatal and midbrain homogenates. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in contralateral rotations in 6-OHDA group versus sham group (p<0.001), and treatment with B. serrata resin extract at doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg significantly decreased the rotations in comparison to 6-OHDA group (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The 6-OHDA group also showed considerable elevation in the latency to initiate crossing (p<0.001) and the total time (p<0.001) on narrow beam test. Moreover, treatment with B. serrata extract at doses of 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg caused a significant reduction in the latency and total time (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.01, respectively). Biochemical analysis showed no significant difference in oxidative stress markers levels among the groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that B. serrata resin extract acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent that protects nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and improve motor impairments in PD."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: The worldwide prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is about 1%, whereas in India, it is approximately 0.75%. The current therapy for RA includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and some recently developed biologic agents, but all of these are associated with adverse effects. Some herbal drugs, such as Boswellia serrata, have been reported to possess anti-inflammatory activity. AIMS: The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-arthritic activity of Boswellia serrata extract (BSE) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six Wistar rats were divided into six equal groups. RA was induced by intradermal injection of 0.1 ml CFA in hind paw. Body weight, ankle diameter, paw volume, arthritic index, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and histopathological examination were assessed. The experimental data were statistically assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The recorded data were analyzed using paired t-test and ANOVA test using SPSS. The data were analyzed and represented as mean difference. Value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: BSE at dose 180 mg/kg showed statistically significant improvement in body weight and decrease in ankle diameter and arthritic index (P < 0.05); however, there was insignificant change in paw volume (P = 0.056). This improvement was comparable with Indomethacin. The level of TNF-α did not show any statistically significant change (P = 0.076). Histopathological results also exhibited a reduction in inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: BSE might have usefulness as an adjunct to conventional therapy of RA."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Considering the increased rate of microbial resistance to antibiotics and chemical side effects of antibiotics and antiseptics used for the treatment of periodontal disease, there is a need for an alternative antimicrobial agent with fewer complications. Medicinal herbs have recently become popular as novel antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to assess the antibacterial effects of hydroalcoholic extracts of Lawsonia inermis, Malva sylvestris, and Boswellia serrata on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydroalcoholic extracts of the three medicinal plants were obtained by the maceration technique and A. actinomycetemcomitans was cultured. Antimicrobial efficacy of the three medicinal plants was compared with that of 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocol using agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution techniques. All tests were repeated three times. RESULTS: Hydroalcoholic extracts of all three plants had antimicrobial activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of L. inermis, M. sylvestris, and B. serrata was 78.1, 156.2, and 1666 μg/mL with no significant difference between them. The MIC of CHX was 3.33 μg/mL, which was significantly higher than that of B. serrata extract. CONCLUSION: Given that further in vivo studies confirm other properties of these extracts and their safety in terms of cytotoxicity and mutagenicity, hydroalcoholic extracts of L. inermis and M. sylvestris may be used in mouthwashes or local delivery systems to affect periodontal biofilm."

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the wound healing potential and possible mechanism of action of the standardized extract of Boswellia serrata against the experimental model of diabetic foot ulcer. α-Boswellic acid was isolated from the standardized extract of B. serrata and characterized (HPLC, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, ESI-MS). Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by streptozotocin (55 mg/kg, i. p.), and wounds were created on the dorsal surface of the hind paw. B. serrata (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, p. o.) was administered to the rats for 16 days. The HPLC analysis showed a single peak with a retention time of 12.51 min. The compound was identified with ESI-MS [M + Na]+ = 455.37 as α-boswellic acid. Treatment with B. serrata (200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly increased the rate of wound contraction via modulation of oxido-nitrosative stress and elevated the hydroxyproline level at the wound area. reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that streptozotocin-induced increases in TNF-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, and Bcl-2-associated X protein, and decreases in angiopoietin-1, Tie2, transforming growth factor beta 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and collagen-1 mRNA expression were significantly inhibited by B. serrata. It also significantly reduced wound cellular necrosis as evaluated by flow cytometry using propidium iodide fluorescence intensity. Streptozotocin-induced histopathological alterations were also significantly ameliorated by B. serrata. In conclusion, standardized extracts of B. serrata exert its wound healing potential via orchestrating mechanisms, which include the inhibition of oxido-inflammatory markers (oxido-nitrosative stress, TNF-α, interleukins, and nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), increased collagen synthesis (hydroxyproline and collagen-1) and angiogenesis (Ang-1/Tie2), promoting growth factors (transforming growth factor beta 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor), and inhibition of apoptosis (Bcl-2-associated X protein) to accelerate wound healing in experimental delayed diabetic foot ulcer.",

A total of 48 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee were randomized and allocated to the BSE and placebo groups for intervention. Patients were administered BSE or placebo for a period of 120 days. The trial results revealed that BSE treatment significantly improved the physical function of the patients by reducing pain and stiffness compared with placebo. Radiographic assessments showed improved knee joint gap and reduced osteophytes (spur) confirming the efficacy of BSE treatment. BSE also significantly reduced the serum levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein, a potential inflammatory marker associated with OA of the knee. No serious adverse events were reported. This is the first study with BSE conducted for a period of 120 days, longer than any other previous clinical trial on patients with OA of the knee. The findings provide evidence that biologically active constituents of BSE, namely, AKBBA and BBA, act synergistically to exert anti-inflammatory/anti-arthritic activity showing improvement in physical and functional ability and reducing the pain and stiffness.",
