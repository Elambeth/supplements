      "abstract": "The aquaculture industry must continue to reduce its reliance on finite marine ingredients and promote biocircularity to enhance sustainability. This study evaluated the effects of no-fishmeal (FM) diets and fish protein hydrolysates (FPHs) on the growth performance, antioxidant status, and immune responses of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). Following established conditions, two FPHs were prepared from the enzymatic hydrolysis of discards from whole-body blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and gurnard heads (Trigla spp.); the former contained a higher proportion of large peptides (LPs), while the latter had more small peptides (SPs). Four isoproteic (48%) and isolipic (16%) diets were tested: a commercial (COM)-like diet with 35% FM, 10% poultry meal, and 5% soy protein concentrate; a FUTURE (FUT) diet, without FM or soy protein concentrate, containing 25% poultry meal; and two FUT diets supplemented with FPH (FUTLP and FUTSP). Gilthead seabream (initial weight ± 8.0 g) was distributed into 500 L tanks at an initial density of 1.4 kg m-3 and fed the experimental diets to apparent satiety for 8 weeks. Sampling was performed at the end of the growth trial, followed by a digestibility trial. Nutrient and energy digestibilities were significantly lower in the FUT than in the COM diet, with protein and energy digestibilities being 7% and 16% lower, respectively, in the FUT treatment, leading to higher nitrogen losses. Growth performance and feed utilization were negatively impacted in the FUT treatment, with weight gain of only 310 ± 33% compared to 482 ± 22% in the COM treatment. Additionally, immune responses in plasma and antioxidant status in the liver were slightly impaired in the FUT treatment. Supplementation of FPH to the FUT diet mitigated or even reversed these negative effects. The results confirmed that including small- and medium-sized peptides in no-FM diets is more beneficial than using larger ones."

      "abstract": "The use of fish rest raw material for the production of fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) through enzymatic hydrolysis has received significant interest in recent decades. Peptides derived from fish proteins are known for their enhanced bioactivity which is mainly influenced by their molecular weight. Studies have shown that novel technologies, such as high-pressure processing (HPP), can effectively modify protein structures leading to increased biological activity. This study investigated the effect of various HPP conditions on the molecular weight distribution, antioxidant activity, and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory effect of FPH derived from a mixture of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) rest raw material. Six different treatments were applied to the samples before enzymatic hydrolysis; 200 MPa × 4 min, 200 MPa × 8 min, 400 MPa × 4 min, 400 MPa × 8 min, 600 MPa × 4 min, and 600 MPa × 8 min. The antioxidant and DPP-IV inhibitory effects of the extracted FPH were measured both in vitro and at cellular level utilizing human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The results indicated that low and moderate pressures (200 and 400 MPa) increased the proportion of larger peptides (2-5 kDa) in the obtained FPH, while treatment at 600 MPa × 4 min resulted in a higher proportion of smaller peptides (1-2 kDa). Furthermore, HPP led to the formation of peptides that demonstrated increased antioxidant activity in Caco-2 cells compared to the control, whereas their potential antidiabetic activity remained unaffected.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular properties decline with ageing and low-level physical activities. Alaska pollack protein (APP) is reportedly effective for improving skeletal muscular functions, even if the amount is small and exercise is not conducted. However, it is unclear whether APP intake without an exercise program affects neuromuscular dysfunction in community-dwelling adults conducting normal, everyday activities. This study aimed to investigate changes in motor unit firing properties by adding APP to daily meals in community-dwelling older adults. They were divided into an APP group or a placebo control (CON) group for randomised, double-blind treatment. Participants in APP (n = 15) and CON (n = 17) groups ingested 4.5 g/d APP and whey protein, respectively, added to daily meals for 3 months without a specific exercise intervention. High-density surface electromyography of the vastus lateralis to assess the individual motor unit firing rate during 70% of maximum voluntary ramp-up contraction (MVC), maximum knee extensor strength, muscle thickness, echo intensity, and a physical function test were evaluated at the baseline, as well as 1.5 and 3 months after the intervention. While muscle strength, muscle thickness, and motor function were not changed, the motor unit firing rate at 50%-70% of MVC showed a significant decline at 1.5 and 3 months in the CON group, but this decline was not observed in the APP group. These findings suggest that neuromuscular properties show a detectable decline on performing daily activities without a specific exercise intervention, but such a decline was not observed in the APP intake group.",

      "abstract": "Fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis allows for smart valorization of fish side streams. However, further treatments are normally needed to enhance bioactive and functional properties of the obtained FPH. At present, the commonly used methods to improve functional properties of FPH include chemical and enzymatic modification. Chemical treatments often cause environmental problems, while the enzymatic modification method requires the use of quite expensive enzymes. In recent years, emerging technologies such as ultrasound treatment (US-treatment) have shown great potential in protein modification with high efficiency and safety, low energy consumption, and low nutritional destructiveness. In this study, high-power ultrasound treatments were applied to fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) extracted from Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) side streams to improve their quality parameters. The effect of three different treatments of 300 W, 450 W and 600 W at the operating frequency of 20 kHz for 10 min on the physicochemical, structural, and functional characteristics of FPH, were examined. The results have shown that with an increase in ultrasound power, the protein solubility of FPH increased linearly, and the changes were significant for all US-treated samples compared to control (untreated) samples. US-treatment significantly increased the degree of hydrolysis of FPH samples treated with 450 W and 600 W compared to control samples. The carbonyl content of FPH increased (significantly for 450 W and 600 W), while thiol groups decreased (significantly for 300 W and 450 W). This indicated that some US-treatments induced oxidation of FPH, however the values of the protein oxidation were low. Amino acid composition of FPH revealed that US-treatment increased the proportion of essential amino acids in the sample treated with 300 W and 450 W, but the increase was not significant. After the US-treatment, all FPH samples became lighter and less yellowish and reddish, which suggest potentially higher attractiveness to consumers. In addition, the in vitro antioxidant activity was assessed using the DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS assays and the cell-free dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity was also measured. Moreover, these biological activities were measured at cellular level utilizing human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Specifically, the FPH capacity to lower H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation levels was used to measure its antioxidant activity. The findings suggest that Scomber scombrus hydrolysates could find use as ingredients for promoting health."

      "abstract": "The widespread utilization of straw return was a popular practice straw disposal for highly intensive agriculture in China, which has brought about some negative impacts such as less time for straw complete biodegradation, aggravation of greenhouse gas evolution, and lower efficient of carbon accumulation. It was urgent to find an eco-friendly N-rich organic fertilizer instead of mineral N as activator to solve the above problems and lead a carbon accumulation in long tern management. Besides, microbial necromass was considered as a crucial contributor to persistent soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pool. How organic fertilizer activators influence microbial residue under different amount of crop residues input remained unclear. Thus, soils incorporating moderate and high rate of rice straw residue with additions of half and full of organic activators (fish protein hydrolysates vs. manure) were incubated for measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, microbial community and necromass. It was found that soil CO2 emission was rapidest during the first 13 days of straw decomposition but remained lowest in the treatments of 50% mineral N substituted by fish protein hydrolysate. There were that 81%-89% of total CO2 release and 59%-65% of total N2O emission occurred within 60 days of incubation period, and bacterial community and nitrate positively affected soil CO2 and N2O release respectively. Straw incorporation amount and organic activator application interactively influenced soil CO2 emission but not affected soil N2O emission. After 360 days of incubation, the difference of bacterial necromass was noticeable but fungal necromass remained almost unaltered across all treatments. All treatments showed generally comparable contribution of microbial necromass N to the total N pool. The treatment of 50% mineral N substituted by fish protein hydrolysate under high rate of straw input (HSF50) promoted the highest proportion of microbial necromass C in soil organic C because of alleviating N limitation for microorganisms. Finally, HSF50 was recommended as an eco-friendly strategy for enhancing microbial necromass C and N storage and climate benefits in agroecosystems.",

      "abstract": "To enhance the value of surimi, efforts have been made to develop a fermentation method with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to proteolyze fish protein. However, fermenting unheated surimi poses a spoilage risk due to its high bacterial content. Surimi heat treatment can prevent spoilage, but gel formation induced by heating introduces another technical issue: it hinders uniform fermentation. Thus, this study aims to observe the proteolysis and enhance the functionality of seafood product through lactic acid fermentation of kamaboko, a heated surimi. Upon analyzing the kamaboko fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus JCM1004, we observed that LAB produced protease, resulting in the degradation of myosin heavy chain and actin during fermentation. Lactic acid fermentation significantly augmented the peptide content of kamaboko, subsequently elevating the angiotensin Ⅰ-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in 200-fold diluted extract of fermented kamaboko to approximately 70% and higher. Notably, our investigation revealed that proteolysis was confined to the surface of kamaboko, as evidenced by SDS-PAGE analysis. This observation implies that the surface area of kamaboko influences the ACE inhibitory activity. Through a comparative analysis of various bacterial strains, we demonstrated that the increase in ACE inhibitory activity is contingent on the protease generated by LAB. These results suggest that LAB-mediated proteolysis of fish proteins liberates bioactive peptides, thereby manifesting in the ACE inhibitory activity. In summary, this study underscores that the fermentation of kamaboko employing proteolytic LAB holds promise in the development of novel functional seafood products.",

METHODS: We completed a 16-wk feeding trial using juvenile D. rerio 31 d postfertilization (10 tanks per diet and 14 D. rerio per tank) with formulated diets containing either a typical fish protein ingredient [standard reference (SR) diet] or a novel bacterial SCP source [bacterial protein (BP) diet].

RESULTS: D. rerio fed the BP diet had body weight gains equivalent to the D. rerio fed fish protein, and females had significantly lower total carcass lipid, indicating reduced adiposity. Reproductive success was similar between treatments, suggesting normal physiological function. Genes differentially expressed in female D. rerio fed the BP diet compared with females fed the SR diet were overrepresented in the gene ontologies of metabolism, biosynthesis of cholesterol precursors and products, and protein unfolding responses.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of hydrolyzed fish protein and collagen samples on cell proliferation, as well as to determine the specific influence of minerals and metals on this effect and whether dietary antioxidants can enhance cell proliferation. The results of hydrolyzed fish protein and collagen samples showed negative effects on Caco-2 cell proliferation at the highest concentrations tested. Moreover, the pre-treatment of these hydrolyzates with vitamin C and E, quercetin and resveratrol increased the proliferation of bioaccessible fractions of hydrolyzated fish protein and collagen samples compared to the bioaccessible fractions without pre-treatment. The highest mineral concentrations were found for P, Ca and Mg. The metals found in the pure hydrolyzates were As, Cd, Hg and Pb; however, they appeared at almost undetectable levels in bioavailable fractions. It can be concluded that the consumption of hydrolyzates of fish by-products is an interesting strategy for complying with EFSA recommendations regarding fish consumption while at the same time reducing fish waste.",

      "abstract": "Fish protein hydrolysates (FPHs) can be obtained from substrates such as fish muscle, skin, and wastes and assign value to these fish by-products. Proteolytic enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of these fish substrates' peptide bonds resulting in smaller peptides that present several bioactive properties. Hydrolysates' bioactive properties are a function of the fish species used as the substrate, the enzyme selectivity or specificity, pH and temperature applied in the reaction, etc. Furthermore, many pre-treatment methods are being applied to fish protein substrates to improve their enzyme susceptibility and increase the number of smaller bioactive peptides. This review addresses the production of FPHs and the main bioactive properties evaluated recently in the literature and emphasizes the substrate treatments by high-pressure processing, microwave, ultrasound, and thermal treatments to achieve better bioactivity making essential amino acids more available in peptides. The bioactive properties most found in FPHs were antioxidants, antimicrobials, anticancer, and antihypertensive. These bioactivities may vary depending on the conditions of hydrolysis, fish species, and fractionation and isolation of specific peptides.New technologies for the treatment of by-products can reduce process losses and achieve better results by cleavage of proteins. Conversely, encapsulation and film utilization can improve bioactivity, bioavailability, and controlled release when applied to foods, resulting in improved health.",

      "abstract": "The metabolic disease hyperuricemia (HUA) is characterized by a disturbance in purine metabolism. Peptides, such as marine fish-derived peptides, have previously been shown to be effective in alleviating HUA. In this study, HUA rats were induced by potassium oxonate with 100 mg/kg (L), 200 mg/kg (M), and 400 mg/kg (H) of marine fish protein peptide (MFPP). The results showed that MFPP could effectively reduce the serum uric acid (SUA) levels compared with the model group rats; kidney histopathology and the levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10) indicated that MFPP attenuated HUA-induced kidney inflammation. Meanwhile, MFPP restored the abundance of beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Blautia, Colidextribacter, and Intestinimonas. MFPP further repaired the intestinal barrier by recovering the expression of gene Ildr2 encoding the tricellular tight junction protein ILDR2 and the immune-related genes Ccr7 and Nr4a3 and also regulated the expression of Entpd8 and Cyp27b1 to restore kidney function and uric acid metabolism. MFPP was proved to have potential as a therapeutic strategy to be included in dietary intervention to relieve HUA.",

      "abstract": "Suitable protein sources are essential requirements for piglet growth and health. Typically, intestinal microbiota co-develops with the host and impact its physiology, which make it more plastic to dietary protein sources at early stages. However, the effects of fermented soybean meal (FSB) and fish meal (FM) on foregut and hindgut microbiota, and their relationship with nutrient digestion and host health remain unclear. In this study, we identified interactions between ileac and colonic microbiota which were reshaped by FSB and FM, and assessed host digestibility and host health in a piglet model. Eighteen weaned piglets (mean weight = 8.58 ± 0.44 kg) were divided into three dietary treatments, with six replicates/treatment. The level of dietary protein was 16%, with FSB, FM, and a mixture of fermented soybean meal and fish meal (MFSM) applied as protein sources. During days 1-14 and 1-28, diets containing MFSM generated higher piglet body weight and average daily gain, but lower feed to weight gain ratios when compared with the FM diet (P < 0.05). Piglets in MFSM and FM groups had lower apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of crude protein (CP) compared with the FSB group (P < 0.05). Serum immunoglobulins (IgM and IgG) in MFSM and FM groups were significantly higher on day 28, but serum cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) were significantly lower than the FSB group on days 14 and 28 (P < 0.05). When compared with FSB and FM groups, dietary MFSM significantly increased colonic acetic acid and butyric acid levels (P < 0.05). Compared with the FM and MFSM groups, the FSB diet increased the relative abundance of ileac Lactobacillus and f_Lactobacillaceae, which were significant positively correlated with CP ATTD (P < 0.05). Compared with the FSB group, the relative abundance of f_Peptostreptococcaceae and Romboutsia in MFSM or FM groups were increased and were significant positively correlated with total carbohydrate (TC) ATTD (P < 0.05). Piglets fed FSB had higher α-diversity in colonic microbiota when compared with other groups (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of colonic unidentified_Clostridiales and Romboutsia in MFSM and FSB groups were significantly higher than in the FM group (P < 0.05). Dietary MFSM or FM increased the relative abundance of colonic Streptococcaceae and Streptococcus, but decreased the relative abundance of Christensenellaceae when compared with the FSB group (P < 0.05). These bacteria showed a significantly positive correlation with serum cytokine and immunoglobulin levels (P < 0.05). Therefore, dietary FSB improved CP digestibility by increasing the relative abundance of ileac f_Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus, while dietary MFSM benefited TC digestibility by increasing f_Peptostreptococcaceae and Romboutsia. Dietary MFSM and FM enhanced immunoglobulin secretion by increasing colonic f_Streptococcaceae and Streptococcus prevalence, while dietary FSB promoted cytokine production by increasing microbiota diversity and Romboutsia and Christensenellaceae. Our data provide a theoretical dietary basis for young animals using plant and animal protein sources."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The main aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a fish protein supplement made from by-products from production of Atlantic salmon, on blood concentration of micronutrients. METHODS: We conducted an 8-week double-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial. In total, 88 adults were randomised to a salmon fish protein supplement or placebo, and 74 participants were included in the analysis of vitamin D, omega-3, vitamin B12, selenium, folate, zinc, homocysteine and mercury. RESULTS: During the intervention period, geometric mean (GSD) of serum vitamin B12 concentrations increased from 304 (1.40) to 359 (1.42) pmol/L in the fish protein group (P vs. controls = 0.004) and mean (SD) serum selenium increased from 1.18 (0.22) to 1.30 (0.20) μmol/L (P vs. controls = 0.002). The prevalence of low vitamin B12 status (B12 < 148-221 > pmol/L) decreased from 15.4 to 2.6% in the fish protein group, while increasing from 5.9 to 17.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.045). There was no difference between the groups in serum levels of the other micronutrients measured. CONCLUSION: Including a salmon fish protein supplement in the daily diet for 8 weeks, increases serum vitamin B12 and selenium concentrations. From a sustainability perspective, by-products with high contents of micronutrients and low contents of contaminants, could be a valuable dietary supplement or food ingredient in populations with suboptimal intake. TRAIL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT03764423) on June 29th 2018.",

Semi-dried fish was fermented by applying Monascus purpureus Went M 3.439. Our results show that the Monascus fermentation of the fish protein enriched the free amino acids and achieved a relatively higher glutamate content than the control group. The Monascus treatment promoted the decomposition of the fish protein during in vitro digestion, reduced the ammonia and indole content and tended to increase the propionic acid content during in vitro fermentation. The Monascus treatment considerably changed the gut microbiota composition, and particularly increased the relative abundance of Parabacteroides in the in vitro fermentation model of human distal colon. Consumption of Monascus fermented fish protein could result in positive changes in fermentation metabolites and gut microbiota, which brings potential health benefits.",

In Exp. 1, the available energy content of FPH was determined by difference methods: 12 barrows with an initial body weight (BW) of 40.0 ± 2.1 kg were randomly assigned into two dietary treatments with six replicates per treatment, the treatments contained a corn basal diet and an experimental diet in which 20% corn was replaced by FPH. The experiment lasted for 12 d, with 7 d adaptation period followed by 5 d total collection of feces and urine. In Exp. 2, the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA in FPH by the N-free method was determined, 12 barrows (initial BW of 35.3 ± 1.8 kg) with ileal T-cannulas were randomly allotted into two treatments with six replicates per treatment, and the dietary treatments consisted of an experimental diet and a N-free diet. The experiment was lasted for 7 d, with 5 d adaptation period followed by 2 d collection of ileal digesta. In Exp. 3, the effect of FPH on the performance of piglets was conducted. One hundred ninety-two piglets (initial BW of 8.10 ± 1.8 kg) were randomly allotted into four treatments with six replicates per treatment. The treatments were a control diet with fish meal (FM) and part or all FM was replaced by FPH, receiving diets containing 2%, 3%, or 5% FPH. The experiment lasted for 28 d. Results showed that in Exp. 1, the DE and ME of FPH were 21.12 and 20.28 MJ/kg. In Exp. 2, the SID of Lys, Met, Thr, and Trp was 79.99%, 87.17%, 68.29%, and 71.53%, respectively. In Exp. 3, addition of 3% FPH increased nutrient digestibility and volatile fatty acid content in feces. Addition of 5% FPH increased the average daily feed intake (ADFI), significantly increased (P < 0.05) the activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and immunoglobulin A (IgA), while significantly decreased (P<0.05) the average daily gain (ADG). In conclusion, FPH had a high value of digestible energy and ileal digestible essential amino acids, and could improve nutrient digestibility, immunity, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal health of piglets, while adverse to nitrogen deposition in piglets.",

Of the three mAbs raised against crude protein extract of cooked fish muscle, mAb 8F5 exhibited a positive reaction to all 50 common food fish species tested with no cross-reactions to shellfish, land animals, or food additives. Although the ELISA results were negative against swordfish and yellowfin tuna, western blot clearly detected both after cooking. The ~36 kDa antigenic protein of mAb 8F5, which was found in all fish species, was detectable by mAb 8F5 in all of the fish samples even after prolonged heat treatment (100 °C, up to 60 min). These findings suggest that mAb 8F5 has great potential utility as a probe for the immunochemical detection of fish tissue in cooked food."

An understanding of the effects on both young and older adults contributes to its effective application. We investigated the effect of fish protein ingestion with resistance training on neural and muscular adaptations in young adults using interventions and assessments that have already been tested in older adults. Methods: Eighteen young adults underwent 8 weeks of isometric knee extension training. During the intervention, nine participants ingested 5 g of fish protein (n = 9, Alaska pollack protein, APP), and the other nine participants ingested casein as a control (n = 9, CAS) in addition to daily meals. Before, during, and after the intervention, the isometric knee extension force, lower extremity muscle mass, and motor unit firing pattern of knee extensor muscles were measured. Results: Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was significantly increased in both APP and CAS groups from 0 weeks to 4, 6, and 8 weeks of intervention (p < 0.001), but there were no significant differences between the groups (p = 0.546-0.931). Muscle mass was not significantly changed during the intervention in either group (p = 0.250-0.698). Significant changes in motor unit firing rates (p = 0.02 and 0.029 for motor units recruited at 20-40% of MVC and at 40-60%) were observed following the intervention in the APP but not CAS (p = 0.120-0.751) group. Conclusions: These results suggest that dietary fish protein ingestion changes motor unit adaptations following resistance training in young adults."

A high-protein (HP) diet (45% and 55% fish protein rich in ω3 fatty acids) was given to alloxan-induced diabetic rats for 28 days. Blood samples were collected for monitoring serum glucose, oxidative stress markers, lipid profile, kidney function markers, serum proteins, and liver function markers. Results indicated that there was a noteworthy control (p < .05) of serum glucose, oxidative stress, and lipid profile in HP diet treated diabetic rats. Treatment with 45% and 55% fish diet appreciably improved the concentration of serum creatinine, urea, uric acid and exhibited a vibrant improvement in renal functions. Our results confirmed that the HP diet restored total protein and albumin concentration in blood. The HP diet treatment also restored the normal serum aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase concentration."

A total number of 720 fish of 122.18 ± 6.22 g were fed for 92 days with three different diets in triplicate (3 tanks/diet). A diet based on FM/vegetable meal was used as control. The other two diets were formulated by replacing FM with 5% of either FPH or HiCell®. To analyze the gut microbiota associated to autochthonous and allochthonous microbial communities, the Illumina MiSeq platform for sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and QIIME pipeline were used. RESULTS: A total number of 102 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) at 97% identity were identified in fish gut samples collected at the end of feeding trial. Fourteen OTUs constituted the core gut microbiota, i.e. those OTUs found in at least nine out of fifteen samples per group and shared regardless of the diet. Eight OTUs were assigned to Firmicutes represented by Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Bacillus genera, and six to Proteobacteria phylum. Dietary dried yeast autolysate modulated the intestinal microbiota by promoting the growth of some beneficial bacteria. At order level, fish fed yeast showed an enrichment in Bacillales and Clostridiales as compared to the control group, whereas fish fed FPH showed a significantly lower amount of bacteria belonging to Alteromonadales and Enterobacteriales than the other two feeding groups. Although we did not observe any effect of 5% FM replacement with alternative nitrogen sources at phylum level, at lower taxonomical levels, the composition of gut microbiota, in terms of relative abundance of specific taxa, was significantly influenced by the dietary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The metabarcoding analysis revealed a clearly intestinal microbiota modulation in response to dietary autolyzed yeast. The abundance of some beneficial bacteria, i.e. indigestible carbohydrate degrading- and SCFA producing bacteria, was positively affected. Autolysed dried yeast obtained by the fermentation of a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae could be a valid alternative protein source to FM as well as a valid functional ingredient for aquafeed production [corrected].",

Hydrolysates were characterized with respect to proximate composition, amino acid profile, and molecular weight distribution. The antioxidant activity of the hydrolysate was also observed. RESULTS: The pH and duration of hydrolysis significantly affected (p < 0.05) the characteristics of FPH. The highest yield of hydrolysate (49.04 ± 0.90%), with a degree of hydrolysis of 30.65 ± 1.82%, was obtained at pH 9 after 24 h incubation. In addition, the FPH had high antioxidant activity (58.20 ± 0.55%), with a high level of essential amino acids. Results suggested that FPH produced using endogenous enzymes represents a promising additive for food and industrial applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various methodologies have been employed for the therapeutic interpolation of the progressive brain disorder Alzheimer's disease. Thus, β-secretase inhibition is significant to prevent disease progression in the early stages. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to purify and characterize a novel β-secretase inhibitory peptide from Pacific hake enzymatic hydrolysate. METHODS: A potent β-secretase inhibitory peptide was isolated by sequential purifications using Sephadex G-25 column chromatography and octadecylsilane (ODS) C18 reversed-phase HPLC. A total of seven peptides were synthesized using the isolated peptide sequences. SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the human ''Swedish'' amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation APP695 (SH-SY5YAPP695swe) were used as an in-vitro model system to investigate the effect of Leu-Asn peptide on APP processing. RESULTS: The β-secretase inhibitory activity (IC50) of the purified peptide (Ser-Leu-Ala-Phe-Val-Asp- Asp-Val-Leu-Asn) from fish protein hydrolysate was 18.65 μM and dipeptide Leu-Asn was the most potent β-secretase inhibitor (IC50 value = 8.82 µM). When comparing all the seven peptides, the inhibition pattern of Leu-Asn dipeptide was found to be competitive by Lineweaver-Burk plot and Dixon plot (Ki value = 4.24 µM). The 24 h treatment with Leu-Asn peptide in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in reducing the β-amyloid (Aβ) production in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the results of this study suggest that β-secretase inhibitory peptides derived from marine organisms could be potential candidates to develop nutraceuticals or pharmaceuticals as antidementia agents.",

We investigated the effect of fish protein ingestion on training-induced neural and muscular adaptations in older adults. Twenty older adults participated 8 weeks of isometric knee extension training intervention. The participants were divided into two groups who took fish protein (n = 10, Alaska pollack protein, APP) or casein (n = 10, CAS). Maximal muscle strength during knee extension, lower extremity muscle mass (body impedance method), and motor unit firing pattern of knee extensor muscle (high-density surface electromyography) were measured before, during, and after the intervention. Muscle strength were significantly increased in both CAS (124.7 ± 5.8%) and APP (117.1 ± 4.4%) after intervention (p < .05), but no significant differences between the groups were observed (p > .05). Significant increases in lower extremity muscle mass from 0 to 8 weeks were demonstrated only for APP (102.0 ± 3.2, p < .05). Greater changes in motor unit firing pattern following intervention were represented in CAS more than in APP. These results suggest that nutritional supplementations could modulate neural and muscular adaptations following resistance training and fish protein ingestion preferentially induces muscular adaptation without the detectable neural adaptation in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Fish processing by-products often generated as discard can enzymatically be processed into a product known as fish protein hydrolysates (FPH). FPH is a good source of amino acid and peptides with bioactivities. FPH can be added to foods to improve nutritive values and bioactivities. However, bitterness in FPH, associated with hydrophobicity, degree of hydrolysis, molecular weight, proline residues, type of enzymes, and amino acid sequences has limited its uses in foods. Thus, FPH is used in foods at low levels. Numerous procedures such as extraction with alcohol, activated carbon treatment, Maillard reaction, cyclodextrin, chromatographic separation, and enzymatic hydrolysis with exopeptidase and plastein reaction have been explored to remove the bitterness of FPH. These methods can lower bitterness and improve its taste. However, changes in structure and loss of some peptides may occur. FPH with less or no bitterness can therefore be used at higher levels to alleviate nutrition deficiencies in foods. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) is a nutritive ingredient, which can be produced from fish processing by-products. However, bitterness in FPH has limited its potential use as a nutritive ingredient. As a result, it is incorporated into foods at low levels. Nevertheless, application of several reported debittering processes could assist to solve the problem of bitterness in FPH. The debittering can improve sensory property of FPH, thus widening its utilization.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Age-related loss of muscle mass and function is common in older adults, and studies investigating if dietary proteins may protect and possibly build lean body mass are needed. We assessed the feasibility of conducting a nutritional intervention study in older nursing home residents to investigate the effects of fish protein supplementation on markers of glucose metabolism and inflammation. METHODS: This was a double-blind randomised controlled pilot study. Twenty-four nursing home residents, without major cognitive impairment, received a daily oral nutritional supplement containing 5.2 g of fish protein or placebo for 6 weeks. Anthropometric measurements were conducted at baseline. Participants were screened for nutritional risk using the Mini Nutritional Assessment and activities of daily living using the Barthel index and dietary intake was registered. Hand grip strength was measured and fasting blood samples collected at baseline and endpoint. RESULTS: Compliance was high and dropout was low, but participant recruitment was challenging. Serum concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 decreased, and C-reactive protein increased in the intervention group compared to control, with no changes in markers of glucose metabolism between groups. CONCLUSION: Conducting a nutritional intervention using fish protein supplementation in older nursing home residents is feasible but should be conducted as a multi-centre study to account for the low recruitment rate observed in the present study. A full-scale study is needed to gain more knowledge on the potential effects of fish proteins on markers of glucose metabolism and inflammation in relation to the age-related loss of muscle mass and function.

Fifty healthy elderly males and females (69.2 ± 4.7 years) underwent 6 weeks of intervention. We applied the leg-press exercise as resistance training and fish protein including Alaska pollack protein (APP) as nutritional supplementation. Subjects were divided into four groups: fish protein intake without resistance training (APP-CN, n = 13), placebo intake without resistance training (PLA-CN, n = 12), fish protein intake with resistance training (APP-RT, n = 12), and placebo intake with resistance training (PLA-RT, n = 13). Motor unit firing rates were calculated from multi-channel surface electromyography by the Convolution Kernel. For the chair-stand test, while significant increases were observed at 6 weeks compared with 0 week in all groups (p < 0.05), significant increases from 0 to 3 weeks and 6 weeks were observed in APP-RT (18.2 ± 1.9 at 0 week to 19.8 ± 2.2 at 3 weeks and 21.2 ± 1.9 at 6 weeks) (p < 0.05). Increase and/or decrease in the motor unit firing rate were mainly noted within motor units with a low-recruitment threshold in APP-RT and PLA-RT at 3 and 6 weeks (12.3 pps at 0 week to 13.6 pps at 3 weeks and 12.1 pps at 6 weeks for APP-RT and 12.9 pps at 0 week to 13.9 pps at 3 weeks and 14.1 pps at 6 weeks for PLA-RT at 50% of MVC) (p < 0.05), but not in APP-CN or PLA-CN (p > 0.05). Time courses of changes in the results of the chair-stand test and motor unit firing rate were different between APP-RT and PLA-RT. These findings suggest that, in the elderly, the effect of resistance training on the motor unit firing rate is observed in motor units with a low-recruitment threshold, and additional fish protein intake modifies these adaptations in motor unit firing patterns and the motor function following resistance training."

Blue whiting is used mainly to produce fish meal for the feed industry and during this production, a water-soluble protein fraction, containing small peptides that are easily absorbed and may hold bioactive properties, is isolated. The effects of water-soluble fish protein on cholesterol metabolism were investigated in twelve male obese Zucker fa/fa rats. Rats were fed diets with water-soluble protein from blue whiting (BWW) as 1/3 of the total protein and the remaining 2/3 as casein (BWW group) or with casein as the sole protein source (control group). After 5 weeks intervention, the BWW group had lower serum total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations and lower cholesteryl ester concentration compared to controls. Hepatic concentrations of cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and LDL receptors were also lower in the BWW group. The groups had a similar concentration of serum total bile acids and similar fecal excretions of cholesterol and bile acids. To conclude, the BWW diet led to lower concentrations of serum and liver cholesterol in obese Zucker fa/fa rats, probably due to lower hepatic cholesterol synthesis.",

Performances of salmon fed diets based on fish meal (STD) or a mix of fishmeal and hydrolysed fish proteins (HFM) as the major protein sources were compared in terms of mortality, diet digestibility, growth and skeletal deformities. Separate groups of diploids and triploids were reared in triplicate tanks (initially 3000 fish per tank; tank biomass ca. 620 g) from 0-2745 degree-days post-start feeding (ddPSF). Growth metrics (weight, length, condition factor) were recorded at ca. 4 week intervals, external signs of deformities to the operculum, jaws and spinal column were examined in parr sampled at 1390 ddPSF, and external signs of deformity and vertebral anomalies (by radiography) were examined in fish sampled at the end of the trial (2745 ddPSF). The triploid salmon generally had a lower mass per unit length, i.e. lower condition factor, throughout the trial, but this did not seem to reflect any consistent dietary or ploidy effects on either dietary digestibility or the growth of the fish. By the end of the trial fish in all treatment groups had achieved a weight of 50+ g, and had completed the parr-smolt transformation. The triploids had slightly, but significantly, fewer vertebrae (Triploids STD 58.74 ± 0.10; HFM 58.68 ± 0.05) than the diploids (Diploids STD 58.97 ± 0.14; HFM 58.89 ± 0.01), and the incidence of skeletal (vertebral) abnormalities was higher in triploids (Triploids STD 31 ± 0.90%; HFM 15 ± 1.44%) than in diploids (Diploids STD 4 ± 0.80%; HFM 4 ± 0.83%). The HFM diet gave a significant reduction in the numbers of triploid salmon with vertebral anomalies in comparison with the triploids fed the STD diet possibly as a result of differences in phosphorus bioavailability between the two diets. Overall, the incidence of skeletal deformities was lower than reported in previous studies (Diploids 20+%, Triploids 40+%), possibly as a result of the combination of rearing at low-temperature and phosphorus-rich diets being used in the present study.",

DESIGN: Cluster-randomized community-based controlled trial. For 6 months, the centres received either FPi replacing 50 % of total proteins in the diet or standard protein. HAZ and WHZ were used to determine the effect on growth. Acceptability was determined by daily consumption, measured by weighing the servings before and after consumption. SETTING: Day care centres and community nutritional centres in northern Lima, Peru. SUBJECTS: Children (n 441) aged 6-36 months. RESULTS: Four centres were randomized to the intervention with FPi, five centres were randomized to the standard control diet. More than 36 900 meals were prepared and administered in a supervised manner. Both groups received the same amounts of energy and proteins daily (proteins about 12-15 % of total energy). Growth of children who received the FPi diet was similar to that of children with the standard diet. Consumption was similar in the FPi and control groups (70 v. 80 % of amount offered, respectively). The protein was safe and well tolerated. No adverse events were reported. However, the cost of the intervention with FPi was 20-40 % lower v. the standard diet with animal protein derived from beef, chicken, eggs or liver. CONCLUSIONS: The FPi was well accepted and there was no significant difference in growth between both groups. FPi is a potential source of animal protein at lower cost.",

The cooked gel of freeze-thawed control had 39% expressible moisture after an 8.5% cook loss, whereas gels of freeze-thawed SuSo, FPH-2 and FPH-8 had significantly lower expressible moisture (15-22%) and no cook loss.

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Protein hydrolysates are good nutritional supplements as their bioactive ingredients can be easily absorbed and utilized for various metabolic activities. A fish protein hydrolysate (Amizate), prepared by a unique process of hydrolysis has the advantage of high di/tri peptide content (<10 kDa) along with essential and non essential amino acids, micronutrients and vitamins. The effect of Amizate on malnourished children (6-8 years, a total of 438) of Grade I and II (Gomez's classification) with respect to immunoglobulins, CD4/CD8 ratios and hemoglobin was examined. Measurement of these parameters during the user trial study (at the beginning and the end after 4 months) indicated that the levels of the immunological parameters were not significantly altered by the Amizate treatment. The values of immunoglobulins and CD4/CD8 ratios of malnourished children (India) are in the normal range and are in accordance with the reported values of various ethnic groups.

      "abstract": "Protein recovery for fish processing by-products utilizes extreme pH shifts for isoelectric solubilization and precipitation. The purpose of this study was to determine if Escherichia coli would survive exposure to the extreme pH shifts during the protein recovery process. Fresh rainbow trout were beheaded, gutted, and minced and then inoculated with approximately 10(9) CFU of E. coli ATCC 25922 per g, homogenized, and brought to the target pH of 2.0, 3.0, 11.5, or 12.5 by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide to solubilize muscle proteins. The homogenate was blended and centrifuged to separate the lipid and insoluble components (bones, skin, insoluble protein, etc.) from the protein solution. The protein solution was subjected to a second pH shift (pH 5.5) resulting in protein precipitation that was recovered with centrifugation. Microbial analysis was conducted on each fraction (i.e., lipid, insoluble components, protein, and water) with selective and nonselective media. The sums of the surviving E. coli in these fractions were compared with the initial inoculum. The greatest total microbial reduction occurred when the pH was shifted to 12.5 (P < 0.05), i.e., a 4.4-log reduction of cells on nonselective media and a 6.0-log reduction of cells on selective media. The use of selective and nonselective media showed that there was significant (P < 0.05) injury sustained by cells exposed to alkaline treatment (pH 11.5 and 12.5) in all fractions except the insoluble fraction at pH 11.5. Increasing the exposure time or the pH may result in greater bacterial reductions in the recovered protein.",

AIM: To examine whether the partially hydrolysed and dried product of pacific whiting fish influenced the small intestinal damaging side effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin. METHODS: Eight human volunteers completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol of clinically relevant dose of indomethacin (50 mg t.d.s. p.o. for 5 days) with 7 days of fish hydrolysate or placebo starting 2 days prior to indomethacin. Changes in gut permeability were assessed using 5 h urinary lactulose:rhamnose (L/R) ratios. RESULTS: Fish hydrolysate given alone did not affect permeability. In the main study (n = 8), baseline values were similar for both arms (0.28 +/- 0.05 and 0.35 +/- 0.07). Administration of indomethacin (+placebo) caused a fivefold rise in L/R ratios (increasing to 1.54 +/- 0.35), whereas L/R ratios in the same subjects ingesting indomethacin + fish hydrolysate was only 0.59 +/- 0.14 (P < 0.01 vs. indomethacin alone). Dyspeptic symptoms occurred in four of eight subjects taking indomethacin alone, but zero of eight when hydrolysate was co-administered. CONCLUSION: Natural bioactive products (nutriceuticals), such as fish hydrolysates, may provide a novel approach to the prevention and treatment of NSAID-induced and other gastrointestinal injurious conditions.",

The animals were fed with 4 diets: basal diet only (control) or diets supplemented with 5%, 10% and 15% (w/w) FPH. The results show that dietary FPH levels significantly influenced the growth and immunity of the large yellow croaker. Compared with the control group, total weight gain (TWG) in all treatment groups, relative weight gain (RWG) and specific growth rate (SGR) in fish fed with diets supplemented with 10% and 15% FPH were significantly increased (P<0.05). Similar results were observed in immune parameters [lysozyme activity, serum complements, immunoglobulin M (IgM)]. Lysozyme activity, complement C4 and IgM were also significantly increased (P<0.05) in fish fed with diets supplemented with 10% and 15% FPH, while complement C3 level was significantly increased (P<0.05) in all treatment groups.

FPH treatment preferentially stimulated seedling vigour in the following order: soybean>tomato>corn. For soybean, FPH at 2.5 mL/L and 5 mL/L improved the majority of the seed vigour parameters (seedling weight and height, phenolic content, antioxidant activity and chlorophyll content, and lignification-associated GuPX activity). Similarly, for tomato, FPH at 2.5 mL/L stimulated seedling weight and height, GuPX activity and chlorophyll content. However, FPH did not stimulate corn seed vigour.

However, there has been only limited scientific study regarding its true biological activity. AIMS: We therefore tested its efficacy in a variety of models of epithelial injury and repair. METHODS: Effects on proliferation were determined using [(3)H] thymidine incorporation into epithelial rat intestinal RIE-1 and human colonic HT29 cells. Effects on restitution (cell migration) were analysed using wounded HT29 monolayers and its ability to influence gastric injury analysed using a rat indomethacin restraint model. Partial characterisation of bioactive agents was performed using mass spectroscopy, high pressure liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography. RESULTS: Both cell proliferation and cell migration were increased by about threefold when added at 1 mg/ml (p<0.01). Gastric injury was reduced by 59% when gavaged at 25 mg/ml (p<0.05), results similar to using the potent cytoprotective agent epidermal growth factor at 12.5 mug/ml. The vast majority of biological activity was soluble in ethanol, with glutamine in its single, di-, and tripeptide forms probably accounting for approximately 40% of the total bioactivity seen. Fatty acid constituents may also have contributed to cell migratory activity. CONCLUSIONS: Fish protein hydrolysate possesses biological activity when analysed in a variety of models of injury and repair and could provide a novel inexpensive approach for the prevention and treatment of the injurious effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other ulcerative conditions of the bowel. Further studies appear justified.",

We compared the effects of fish protein hydrolysate (FPH), soy protein, and casein (control) on lipid metabolism in Wistar rats and genetically obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats. In Zucker rats, FPH treatment affected the fatty acid composition in liver, plasma, and triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. The mRNA levels of Delta 5 and Delta 6 desaturases were reduced by FPH and soy protein feeding compared with casein feeding. In Zucker rats both FPH and soy protein treatment reduced the plasma cholesterol level. Furthermore, the HDL cholesterol:total cholesterol ratio was greater in these rats and in the Wistar rats fed FPH and soy protein compared with those fed casein. Although fecal total bile acids were greater in soy protein-fed Zucker rats than in casein-fed controls, those fed FPH did not differ from the controls. However, the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was reduced in Zucker rats fed FPH and tended to be lower (P = 0.13) in those fed soy protein compared with those fed casein. Low ratios of methionine to glycine and lysine to arginine in the FPH and soy protein diets, compared with the casein diet, may be involved in lowering the plasma cholesterol concentration. Our results indicate that the effects of FPH and soy protein on fatty acid metabolism are similar in many respects, but the hypocholesterolemic effects of FPH and soy protein appear to be due to different mechanisms. FPH may have a role as a cardioprotective nutrient.",

METHODS: The crossover design of different amounts of vegetable protein added to the constant amount of animal protein was applied to two groups of 7 healthy individuals after the control dietary program. Renal function and 24 hours' urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) were examined on every 7th day of three consecutive 1-week dietary programs. RESULTS: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR; sodium thiosulphate clearance) and renal plasma flow (RPF) significantly decreased after decreasing the intake of animal protein by one third with keeping the amount of vegetable protein constant. The results when substituting vegetable protein for some of the animal protein in the diet without changing the total amount of protein were identical. The filtration fraction and AER did not change over the study periods regardless of dietary composition. CONCLUSION: The lack of an effect a 1-week intake of vegetable protein added to animal protein on GFR and RPF suggests that vegetable protein may be excluded from lists of restriction in low protein diet therapy in patients with renal insufficiency.",

Furthermore, plasma concentrations of aminoacids were measured in 24 control subjects. Before fish protein dietary supplementation, serine, threonine, tyrosine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, leucine, and lysine were lower than in control subjects. Serine, histidine, valine, tyrosine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine increased after treatment, and phenylalanine tended to increase. The ratios of essential: non-essential aminoacids and alanine:branched-chain aminoacids (BCAA) became normal, whereas valine: lycine and serine:glycine increased significantly and tyrosine:phenylalanine was unchanged. Plasma protein concentrations were unchanged after treatment. Serum transferrin, triceps and subscapular skinfolds, and bodyweight index were slightly reduced in the patients, whereas arm muscle circumference was normal. Bodyweight, weight index, and arm muscle circumference increased after active treatment. In conclusion, the increase in body weight and the return to normal of the plasma aminoacid profile and aminoacid ratios seem to indicate that the treatment with this new fish protein preparation may have beneficial effects on some of the nutrition-related abnormalities in haemodialysis patients.",

      "abstract": "The effect of dietary intake of fish (menhaden) oil and fish (cod) protein on the development of pancreatic preneoplastic lesions was examined in male Wistar rats. Fourteen-day-old animals were given a single ip injection of 30 mg L-azaserine/kg body weight [CAS: 115-02-6; diazoacetate serine (ester)]. At 21 days of age they were weaned and maintained on dietary treatment for 4 months. Fish protein did not appear to produce a significantly different preneoplastic response when compared to casein as a protein source. However, a 20% menhaden oil diet, rich in omega 3 fatty acids, produced a significant decrease in the development of both the size and number of preneoplastic lesions when compared to a 20% corn oil diet rich in omega 6 fatty acids. This study provides evidence that fish oils, rich in omega 3 fatty acids, may have potential as inhibitory agents in cancer development.",
