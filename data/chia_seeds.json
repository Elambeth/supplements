      "abstract": "Abundant direct and in-direct genes are involved in regulating sexual hormones, and reproductive process under nitrite antioxidant plants in rabbit feed. However, there is not enough information about the role of chia seeds and matcha tea as anti-oxidative plants inhibit some direct and in-direct genes related to puberty of growing male rabbits. In this study New-Zealand White (NZW) rabbits treated with chia seeds and matcha tea in water from age after weaning to marketing age about two months ago and determent some sexual hormones, direct and in-direct genes related to puberty and reproduction process. Our data showed total testosterone measured by ELISA increased significantly in chia rabbits compared to control. ELISA analysis revealed that there were no alterations in the levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the treated groups. Direct genes such as doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1), sex-determining region Y protein (SRY), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH1) determent by qPCR show up-regulating in matcha groups comparable to control group. While in-direct genes follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) detected by qPCR showed up-regulated in matcha rabbits compared to control rabbits. But, luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) gene was down-regulated in matcha group, and it was up-regulated in chia seeds groups. The prolactin receptor (PRLR) gene investigates down-regulation in all treatment groups. Collectively, matcha tea as one of antioxidant plants were involved those genes studied and activated via hypothalamic- pituitary gonadal axis and led to early puberty in growing male NZW rabbits.",

      "abstract": "The challenge of preserving food quality without relying on harmful antioxidants requires the exploration of natural alternatives, such as chia-derived peptides (YACLKVK, KLKKNL, KLLKKYL, and KKLLKI). The antioxidant properties and stability to processing were evaluated using DPPH and ABTS, iron-reducing, ORAC, and copper chelating assays. The effects of autoclaving, heat treatment with glucose, and ultrasound on the antioxidant activity of the top-performing peptide were examined. YACLKVK displayed the highest antioxidant response with 87.25 ± 2.47 %, 93.65 ± 0.79 %, 0.418 ± 0.018 abs, 44.06 ± 0.78 μM TE/mL, and 86.49 ± 0.12 % in the DPPH, ABTS, iron-reducing capacity, ORAC, and copper chelating assays at 800 μg/mL (DPPH) and 1000 μg/mL, respectively. Autoclaving, heat, and ultrasound treatments reduced YACLKVK's DPPH scavenging to 63.09 ± 0.44 % and 74.15 ± 0.27 % and its Cu chelating capacity to 58.98 ± 1.28 %. YACLKVK retained over 50 % of its antioxidant capacity post-processing. These findings suggest its application as a potent natural antioxidant in food systems, particularly in processed foods where oxidation affects shelf life and quality. Incorporating YACLKVK could enhance food preservation, aligning with consumer preferences for natural-origin ingredients. Studies on commercial scalability, safety, and regulatory compliance will be essential for its widespread adoption in the food industry.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate whether chia (Salvia hispanica) seeds, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids, and vitamins with antioxidant properties, can mitigate the negative effects on male reproductive function caused by cyclophosphamide, a frequently used chemotherapeutic agent. Methods: Male wistar rats are divided into seven groups (n=6). All groups except the normal control (NC) received cyclophosphamide (30mg/kg, i.p.) for the first 5 days. The standard group received clomiphene citrate (0.25 mg/kg, p.o.). Treatment groups T1%, T5%, T10%, and ω-3 received 1%, 5%, and 10% chia seeds in the diet, and 880 mg/kg omega-3 fatty acid (p.o) respectively for 15 days. The effect on the reproductive system was evaluated by analysis of epididymal sperm characteristics, biochemical parameters, and serum testosterone level. Results: Clomiphene citrate improved oligospermia via hormone mediated effect. Chia seeds and omega-3 fatty acid treatment also showed improvement in reproductive parameters including oxidative stress and histological features of the testes. Omega-3 fatty acid treatment was more effective for the prevention of cyclophosphamide toxicity on testes as compared to chia seeds. Nasal bleeding was noted in several animals subjected to chia seed treatment. This occurrence might be attributed to chia seeds' impact on coagulation and/or platelet function, potentially heightened due to chemotherapy associated bone marrow suppression. Conclusions: In our study, chia seeds as well as omega-3 fatty acid treatment were found to be protective against cyclophosphamide-induced reproductive toxicity in rats. However, the adverse effect of hemorrhage associated with drug interaction of chia seeds with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs needs careful attention and further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Iron overload (IOL) can cause hepatorenal damage due to iron-mediated oxidative and mitochondrial damage. Remarkably, combining a natural iron chelator with an antioxidant can exert greater efficacy than monotherapy. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Chia and CoQ10 to chelate excess iron and prevent hepatorenal oxidative damage in IOL mice. Male Swiss albino mice (n = 49) were randomly assigned to seven groups: control, dietary Chia, CoQ10, IOL, IOL + Chia, IOL + CoQ10, and IOL + Chia + CoQ10. Computational chemistry indicates that the phytic acid found in the Chia seeds is stable, reactive, and able to bind to up to three iron ions (both Fe2+ and Fe3+). IOL induced a significant (P < 0.05) increase in serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, TIBC, TSI, RBCs, Hb, MCV, MCH, WBCs, AST, ALT, creatinine, and MDA. IOL causes a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in UIBC, platelets, and antioxidant molecules (GSH, SOD, CAT, and GR). Also, IOL elicits mitochondrial membrane change depolarization, and DNA fragmentation and suppresses mitochondrial DNA copies. Furthermore, substantial changes in hepatic and renal tissue, including hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis, glomerular degeneration, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and tubular degeneration, were observed in the IOL group. Dietary Chia and CoQ10 induced significant (P < 0.05) amelioration in all the mentioned parameters. They can mostly repair the abnormal architecture of hepatic and renal tissues induced by IOL, as signified by normal sinusoids, normal central veins, and neither glomerular damage nor degenerated tubules. In conclusion, the combined treatment with Chia + CoQ10 exerts more pronounced efficacy than monotherapy in hepatorenal protection via chelating excess iron and improved cellular antioxidant status and hepatorenal mitochondrial function in IOL mice.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, the effects of the treatment of chia seeds with a cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet (CP) using argon as a working gas for different times (30, 60, and 120 s) on the rheological, structural, and microstructural properties of the freeze-dried mucilages at -54 °C were investigated. All mucilage gels showed pseudoplastic flow behavior, and CP treatment of chia seeds increased the viscosity of mucilages, probably due to the cross-linking between polymer molecules. The dynamic rheological analysis revealed that all mucilages were elastic gels and that CP treatment improved the elastic properties in a treatment time-dependent manner. Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) results showed that freeze-dried mucilages showed Type I strain-thinning behavior. Similar to small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) results, CP treatment has affected and improved the large deformation behavior of mucilages depending on treatment time. Meanwhile, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed the incorporation of hydroxyl groups onto the surface and the formation of C-O-C glycosidic bonds during plasma treatment. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs showed the formation of denser structures with CP treatment time. Regarding color properties, CP treatment decreased the lightness values of mucilages. Overall, this study showed that CP is an effective way to modify both the SAOS and LAOS properties of freeze-dried chia mucilage and improve viscosity."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 65 female Wistar rats, 5 rats were served as a control group and 60 rats were injected intraperitoneally with one dose of 55 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce DR after 6-8 weeks. The rats were divided into (n = 20 rats each): (a) DR group: did not receive any treatment, (b) DR+ LLLT group was exposed to 670-nm LLLT for 6 weeks (two sessions/week), and (c) DR+ LLLT+ chia seed group, in which rats were exposed to LLLT and administrated with 250 mg/kg/day of chia seeds flour for 2 weeks before STZ injection and continued to the end of the experiment. Blood glucose (BG) levels and retinal histological examination were employed after 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks. RESULTS: The BG level in the DR group and the treated groups were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in the control group after the four-time periods. Chia seeds group exhibited BG levels less than the DR and the DR+ LLLT groups after 6 weeks (P < 0.01). LLLT improved the degeneration of the photoreceptors after 6 weeks of treatment, while LLLT+ chia seeds supplementation showed early photoreceptors improvement after 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: The early improvement in the photoreceptors after LLLT+ chia seed may be attributed to the potent antioxidant properties of chia seeds. Therefore, the combination between LLLT and chia seeds should be employed to protect the retinal photoreceptors against DR."

      "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of obesity has become a demanding issue in both high-income and low-income countries. Treating obesity is challenging as the treatment options have many limitations. Recently, diet modification has been commonly applied to control or prevent obesity and its risks. In this study, we investigated novel therapeutic approaches using a combination of a potential probiotic source with prebiotics. Forty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were selected and divided into seven groups (eight rats per group). The first group was fed a high-fat diet, while the second group was a negative control. The other five groups were orally administered with a probiotic, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), and potential prebiotics sources (chia seeds, green tea, and chitosan) either individually or in combination for 45 days. We collected blood samples to analyze the biochemical parameters and dissected organs, including the liver, kidney, and pancreas, to evaluate obesity-related injuries. We observed a more significant decrease in the total body weight by combining these approaches than with individual agents. Moreover, treating the obese rats with this combination decreased serum catalase, superoxide dismutase, and liver malondialdehyde levels. A histopathological examination revealed a reduction in obesity-related injuries in the liver, kidney, and pancreas. Further docking studies indicated the potential role of chia seeds and green tea components in modulating obesity and its related problems. Therefore, we suggest that the daily administration of a pre- and probiotic combination may reduce obesity and its related problems.",

Acrylamide increased with the intensity of the thermal treatment until a maximum at 180 °C/15 min where levels of precursors were significantly reduced.

      "abstract": "Chia seeds (CS) and sprouts are rich in bioactive compounds. This study aimed to assess the effects of germination and chemical elicitation (salicylic acid [SA]; hydrogen peroxide [H2 O2 ]) on proximate chemical, total phenolics compounds (TPC), non-extractable proanthocyanidins (NEPA), and carotenoids content of chia sprouts; besides, the effects of their supplementation on obesity-associated complications in rats fed with high-fat and fructose diet (HFFD) were evaluated. Protein, carbohydrate, TPC, NEPA, and carotenoids content were higher in sprouts than CS; elicitation enhanced TPC and carotenoids compared to non-elicited (NE) sprouts. CS, NE, and elicited chia sprouts ameliorated insulin resistance and dyslipidemia at the same level in HFFD-fed rats. NE and SA-chia sprouts exerted the biggest reduction in hepatic triglycerides, which could be partially related to inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity. In addition, SA elicitation induced the greatest effect on insulin levels and corporal weight. CS and their sprouts decreased obesity and its complication, mainly SA-elicited sprouts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and obesity has led to the search for prevention and treatment through lifestyle changes, including the consumption of foods rich in bioactive compounds, such as seeds and their sprouts. Since sprouts contain higher concentrations of bioactive compounds and nutrients than seed, germination is a natural alternative to produce ready-to-eat functional foods. Chemical elicitation is a strategy to increase even more the bioactivity of sprouts. CS has been recognized for its beneficial health effects ameliorating dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. This study demonstrates that elicitation, with SA and H2 O2 , during germination of CS, increases the nutrient and phytochemical content of sprouts, with beneficial effects on body weight gain, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and prevention of NAFLD progression in diet-induced obese rats. Therefore, chia sprouts, natural and elicited, may be used as potential nutraceutical foods for the prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications.",

Determination of the thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella on chia seeds and selection of an appropriate nonpathogenic surrogate will provide a foundation for selecting and optimizing thermal pasteurization processes for chia seeds. In this study, chia seed samples from three separate production lots were inoculated with a five-strain Salmonella cocktail or Enterococcus faecium NRRL-B2354 and equilibrated to a water activity of 0.53 at room temperature (25°C). After equilibration for at least 3 days, the inoculated seeds were subjected to isothermal treatments at 80, 85, or 90°C. Samples were removed at six time points, and surviving bacteria were enumerated. Whole chia seeds were diluted in a filter bag at 1:30 because bacterial recovery with this method was similar to that obtained from ground seeds. Survivor data were fitted to consolidated models: one primary model (log linear or Weibull) and one secondary model (Bigelow). E. faecium had higher thermal resistance than did Salmonella, suggesting that E. faecium may be a suitable conservative nonpathogenic surrogate for Salmonella. The Weibull model was a better fit for the survivor data than was the log-linear model for both bacteria based on the lower root mean square error and corrected Akaike's information criterion values. Lipid oxidation measurements and fatty acid concentrations were significantly different from those of the control samples, but the overall magnitude of the differences was relatively small. The thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella and E. faecium on chia seeds may be used as a basis for developing thermal pasteurization processes for chia seeds.",

      "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) was asked to deliver an opinion on the safety of chia seeds in foods subject to thermal processing which may result in the formation of process contaminants. The safety assessment of this novel food (NF) is based on previous assessments of chia seeds by the EFSA NDA Panel, information received from a public call for data by EFSA and information retrieved from an extensive literature search performed by EFSA. In 2019, during the overall safety assessment of chia seeds, the NDA panel retrieved one reference which, among others, investigated the formation of process contaminants, i.e. acrylamide, hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural, in wheat flour-based biscuits with added chia seeds flour. Based on this study, the Panel considers that there is a potential for substantial acrylamide formation in biscuits with 10-20% added chia seeds flour with low residual moisture contents (≤ 2%). The Panel is not aware of further scientific evidence corroborating these findings. The extensive new literature searches performed by EFSA did not show any relevant articles regarding either asparagine content or formation of process contaminants in chia seeds and products thereof. Information received from the call for data were either limited or inconclusive. The available evidence does not provide a basis to conclude whether or not the addition of chia seeds to foods undergoing heat treatment (at temperatures above 120°C) results in increased formation of acrylamide as compared to these foods without chia seeds. Reported concentrations of hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural in heat-treated chia seeds do not pose a safety concern. No information on other process contaminants in chia seeds was found."

The safety assessment of this NF is based on data supplied in seven applications, previous safety assessments of chia seeds and information retrieved from an extensive literature search done by EFSA. Since none of the applications addressed the possible formation of process contaminants, the present assessment is limited to those proposed extended uses which do not raise safety concerns regarding the formation of such contaminants. These include the use of whole and ground chia seeds added to chocolate, fruit spreads, fruit desserts, mixed fruit with coconut milk in twin pot, fruit-preparations to underlay a dairy product, fruit-preparations to be mixed with dairy products, confectionary (excluding chewing gums), dairy products and analogues, edible ices, fruit and vegetables products, non-alcoholic beverages and compotes from fruit and/or vegetables and/or with cereals. In addition, this assessment also concerns uses of chia seeds without specific restrictions and precautions regarding their use levels in other foods which usually do not include heat treatment during processing and cooking. Apart from allergenicity, the Panel did not identify any hazard which causes safety concerns. Lacking the basis and need to establish safe maximum intake levels for chia seeds, no exposure assessment was conducted. The Panel concludes that chia seeds are safe under the assessed conditions of use."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Salvia hispanica seeds have been commonly used by people that seek healthy habits through natural foods to reduce cholesterol and triacylglycerides levels, however, the evidences that support this assumption are still scarce in literature. Here, we aimed to evaluate the lipid lowering effects of chia by using Caenorhabditis elegans as animal model, a nematode that has proven its usefulness for lipid metabolism studies. METHODS: We prepared hexane (HE) and Bligh-Dyer (BDE) extracts, evaluated and compared their safety, antioxidant potential and their lipid-lowering activity in the worms. RESULTS: The characterization of both extracts demonstrated that there were no differences in their lipid composition; however, BDE depicted better antioxidant potential. Both extracts reduced worm's survival from 2%, and reproduction was reduced following treatment with both extracts, though a more notable effect was observed in HE-treated worms. In addition, the non-toxic concentration of both extracts (1%) increased stress resistance against paraquat toxicity in an antidote paradigm. Notably, this same concentration of both extracts reduced lipid accumulation in obese worms, which was not caused by food deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data demonstrate that both extraction methods from chia seeds result in oils that are rich in mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may modulate lipid accumulation and provide antioxidant resistance in C. elegans."
