      "abstract": "Camelina sativa is an oilseed crop rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA), an n-3 fatty acid (FA), and is resistant to harsh climates and pests. Previously, supplementation with camelina oil (CAM) in horses had no adverse effects on basic health parameters and had comparable skin and coat parameters as both flaxseed oil (FLX) and canola oil (OLA). Further, the plasma FA profile of horses was reflective of their respective treatment oil. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of dietary CAM supplementation on skin FA profile, immune, and inflammatory responses as compared to 2 commonly used oils in the equine industry, OLA and FLX, in healthy adult horses. Twenty-four adult horses, from 2 separate herds, were enrolled in this experiment. The horses underwent a gradual 4-wk fat acclimation period to sunflower oil (approximately 0.28% ALA), then were supplemented with either CAM (approximately 34.9% ALA), OLA (approximately 12.0% ALA), or FLX (56.0% ALA) at an inclusion rate of 0.37 g/kg body weight (BW) per day for an additional 16 wk. Immune and inflammatory responses were assessed by measuring antibody concentrations across time after sensitization to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) at weeks 10 and 12, and a subsequent delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) challenge. Skin biopsy samples were collected at weeks 0, 8, and 16, and FA composition was determined using gas-chromatography. All data were analyzed as a repeated measures ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. Antibody and DTH responses to KLH did not differ among groups (P = 0.262 and 0.813, respectively), and no treatment by time effects were observed (P = 0.764 and P = 0.817, respectively). Most FA in the skin changed in composition across time, with the sum of n-3 FA increasing (P < 0.001) and the sum of n-6 FA and skin n-6:n-3 ratio decreasing over time (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Only dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (P = 0.025) and the sum of n-3 FA (P = 0.031) had treatment-by-week effects. At week 16, the composition of eicosapentaenoic acid in the skin was greater in FLX than OLA, but neither differed from CAM (P = 0.049). These results suggest that ALA supplementation may beneficially impact skin FA profile. However, due to the small differences in n-3 FA and n-6:n-3 ratio among CAM, FLX, and OLA, a comparable skin FA profile, immune, and inflammatory response was observed among treatments at a dose of 0.37 g oil/kg BW. Therefore, CAM may be a suitable alternative to FLX in equine diets for the delivery of ALA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: obesity is a worldwide problem that seriously endangers human health. Canola oil (Col) has been reported to regulate hepatic steatosis by influencing oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in Kunming mice. However, whether Col exhibits an anti-obesity effect by altering the gut microbiota remains unknown. METHODS: in this study, we observed that a high-fat diet increased lipogenesis and gut microbiota disorder in C57BL/6J male mice, while the administration of Col suppressed lipogenesis and improved gut microbiota disorder. RESULTS: the results show that Col markedly reduced the final body weight and subcutaneous adipose tissue of C57BL/6J male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) after 6 weeks of administration. However, although Col did not effectively increase the serum concentration of HDL, we found that treatment with Col notably inhibited the low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TGs) in HFD mice. Furthermore, Col ameliorated obesity in the liver compared to mice that were only fed a high-fat diet. We also found that Col significantly inhibited the relative expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1/2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and insulin-induced genes (Insig1/2) that proved to be closely associated with lipogenesis in HFD mice. In addition, the concentration of acetic acid was significantly increased in Col-treatment HFD mice. Further, we noted that Col contributed to the reprogramming of the intestinal microbiota. The relative abundances of Akkermansia, Dubosiella, and Alistipes were enhanced under treatment with Col in HFD mice. The results also imply that Col markedly elevated the phosphorylation level of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in HFD mice. CONCLUSIONS: the results of our study show that Col ameliorates obesity and suppresses lipogenesis in HFD mice. The underlying mechanisms are possibly associated with the reprogramming of the gut microbiota, in particular, the acetic acid-mediated increased expression of Alistipes via the AMPK signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Removal of polar impurities, such as phospholipids, free fatty acids (FFA), and peroxides, can be challenging during the refining of crude canola oil. Current conventional refining methods are energy-intensive (e.g., hot water washes) and can generate significant waste (e.g., wastewater effluent) and neutral oil loss. This study investigated the joint use of nano-adsorbents and electrostatic field (E-field) treatment as a potential and sustainable alternative in removing these impurities during the oil refining process. Specifically, aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles were employed to neutralize FFAs, achieving a 62.4% reduction in acid value while preserving the fatty acid profile of the oil. After refining, E-field treatment was successful in removing the spent nano-adsorbent from solution (up to 72.3% by weight), demonstrating enhanced efficiency compared to conventional methods (e.g., gravitational settling, filtration, and centrifugation). The neutral oil loss using Al2O3 nano-adsorbents was also comparable to conventional refining methods, with a 4.38% (by weight) loss. After E-field treatment, the Al2O3 nano-adsorbent was then calcined to assess reusability. The Al2O3 nano-adsorbent was effectively recycled for three refining cycles. the methods do not use of large amounts of water and generate minimal waste byproducts (e.g., effluent). Nonetheless, while the nano-adsorbents demonstrated promising results in FFA removal, they were less effective in eliminating peroxides and pigments. E-field techniques were also effective in removing spent nano-adsorbent; although, optimization of E-field parameters could further improve its binding capacity. Finally, future studies could potentially focus on the physicochemical modifications of the nano-adsorbent material to enhance their refining capacity and reusability. Overall, this study presents a sustainable alternative or addition to conventional refining methods and lays the groundwork for future research."

      "abstract": "The objectives of this project were to measure the effect of SeaFeed, a canola oil infused with Asparagopsis armata, on methane emissions, animal health, performance, and carcass characteristics of feedlot cattle. Angus steers (n = 160) with an initial body weight of 474.4 kg were fed a steam-flaked wheat and barley ration for 200 d in a large, commercial feedlot. A single-blinded randomized complete block design compared two treatments including control and SeaFeed included at a rate of 25 mg bromoform per kg dry matter intake (DMI). Monthly testing of bromoform levels in the canola demonstrated that SeaFeed maintained a stable bromoform concentration for 6 mo. The inclusion of SeaFeed had no effect on daily DMI. However, steers fed SeaFeed were more efficient with a 6.6% higher (P < 0.01) gain-to-feed ratio as compared to control steers over the 200-d feeding period. This improved efficiency resulted in 0.094 kg higher (P < 0.01) average daily gain and 19.7 kg higher (P < 0.01) live exit weight in steers fed SeaFeed as compared to control steers. Steers fed SeaFeed produced 51.7% less (P < 0.01) methane and yielded 50.5% less (P < 0.01) methane over the 200-d feeding period as compared to cattle fed the control ration. Peak methane inhibition occurred on day 29 on feed with 90.6% less methane production in cattle fed SeaFeed as compared to control animals. SeaFeed reduced (P < 0.01) methane intensity by 55.4% over the 200-d feeding period. Hot carcass weight tended (P = 0.097) to be 6.9 kg heavier in cattle fed SeaFeed as compared to controls. Cattle fed SeaFeed had similar (P > 0.20) marbling, meat color, eye muscle, area, and ultimate pH to control cattle. Interestingly, cattle fed SeaFeed tended (P = 0.054) to have slightly higher fat color scores. Rumen papillae from cattle fed SeaFeed were more (P < 0.01) gray in color and more oval (P < 0.01) in shape as compared to control animals; however, rumen damage was not different between treatment groups. In regards to food safety and residues, all muscle, fat, and kidney samples were free from bromoform residues. Bromine residues in kidney and meat samples were higher (P < 0.01) in the SeaFeed group as compared to controls. Cattle fed SeaFeed produced strip loin steaks similar (P > 0.05) in eating quality to control cattle. These results demonstrate that SeaFeed reduced methane emissions, improved performance, and produced safe beef with similar eating quality to conventional beef."

      "abstract": "A twelve-week feeding experiment was undertaken to explore the impact of substituting dietary fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) with complex protein (CP) and canola oil (CO) in the diet of triploid rainbow trout on the quality of their fillets. The control diet (F100) contained FM (60%) and FO (18.6%) as the main protein and lipid sources. Based on this, 50% and 100% of FM and FO were substituted by CP and CO and they were named as F50 and F0, respectively. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the specific growth rates, condition factors, gutted yields, fillet yields and yellowness values as the substitution levels increased (p > 0.05). The F50 treatment obtained the highest values of fillet springiness and chewiness, improved the umami and bitter taste of the fillets by increasing the contents of inosine-5'-monophosphate and histidine, and increased lipid, protein, C18: 1n-9 and C18: 2n-6 contents (p < 0.05). The F0 treatment obtained the highest values of fillet hardness and pH, attenuated the sweet taste of the fillets by decreasing the content of glycine, and decreased the contents of EPA and DHA (p < 0.05). Both F50 and F0 treatments could increase the redness value, decrease the lightness and hue values of fillets, and increase the odor intensity, resulting in the typical fillet odors of green, fatty, orange and fishy (p < 0.05). In general, 50% and 100% of FM and FO substitution did not affect the growth of trout, but it did affect quality. Compared to the F100 treatment, the fillet quality of the F0 treatment was similar to the F50 treatment and could improve the appearance and odor intensity of the fillets. However, the difference was that the F50 treatment increased the springiness, umami, bitterness and lipid nutritional value of the fillets, but the F0 treatment increased the hardness, decreased the sweetness, and decreased the lipid, EPA and DHA contents of the fillets."

      "abstract": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was performed to analyze the effects of a small amount of lysolecithin and canola oil on blood glucose levels after consuming japonica rice. Overall, 17 Japanese adult men were assigned to consume 150 g of normally cooked japonica rice (placebo group) and 150 g of japonica rice cooked with 18 mg of lysolecithin and 1.8 g of canola oil (treatment group); these lipids were added as emulsified formulation (EMF) for stability and uniformity. Subsequently, blood samples were collected before and 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after consuming test foods. There was no significant difference in blood glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels between the groups. However, a stratified analysis of 11 subjects with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 22 revealed that blood glucose levels were significantly lower after 30 min in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p = 0.041). Through in vitro digestibility test, the rice sample of the treatment group was observed to release significantly less glucose within 20 min than that in the placebo group rice. These results suggest that the combination of a small amount of lysolecithin and canola oil modulated the increase in postprandial blood glucose levels induced by the intake of cooked japonica rice in adult men with BMI ≥ 22.

      "abstract": "Asparagopsis taxiformis (Asparagopsis) has been shown to be highly efficacious at inhibiting the production of methane (CH4) in ruminants. To date, Asparagopsis has been primarily produced as a dietary supplement by freeze-drying to retain the volatile bioactive compound bromoform (CHBr3) in the product. Steeping of Asparagopsis bioactive compounds into a vegetable oil carrier (Asp-Oil) is an alternative method of stabilizing Asparagopsis as a ruminant feed additive. A dose-response experimental design used 3 Asp-Oil-canola oil blends, low, medium, and high Asp-Oil which provided 17, 34, and 51 mg Asparagopsis derived CHBr3/kg dry matter intake (DMI), respectively (in addition to a zero CHBr3 canola oil control), in a tempered-barley based feedlot finisher diet, fed for 59 d to 20 Angus heifers (five replicates per treatment). On four occasions, live weight was measured and CH4 emissions were quantified in respiration chambers, and blood, rumen fluid, and fecal samples were collected. At the end of the experiment, all animals were slaughtered, with carcasses graded, and samples of meat and edible offal collected for testing of consumer sensory qualities and residues of CHBr3, bromide, and iodide. All Asp-Oil treatments reduced CH4 yield (g CH4/kg DMI, P = 0.008) from control levels, with the low, medium, and high Asp-Oil achieving 64%, 98%, and 99% reduction, respectively. Dissolved hydrogen increased linearly with increasing Asp-Oil inclusion, by more than 17-fold in the high Asp-Oil group (P = 0.017). There was no effect of Asp-Oil treatment on rumen temperature, pH, reduction potential, volatile fatty acid and ammonia production, rumen pathology, and histopathology (P > 0.10). There were no differences in animal production and carcass parameters (P > 0.10). There was no detectable CHBr3 in feces or any carcass samples (P > 0.10), and iodide and bromide residues in kidneys were at levels unlikely to lead to consumers exceeding recommended maximum intakes. Overall, Asp-Oil was found to be safe for animals and consumers of meat, and effective at reducing CH4 emissions and yield by up to 99% within the range of inclusion levels tested.",

      "abstract": "Camelina (Camelina sativa) is a hardy, low-input oilseed crop that provides a rich source of the n-3 fatty acid, α-linolenic acid (ALA). The primary purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of dietary camelina oil (CAM) consumption on various health parameters, as compared to horses fed canola oil (OLA) or flax oil (FLX). Secondly, to determine how dietary CAM, FLX, and OLA alter circulating plasma total lipids across time. Thirty horses, from three separate herds, were used for this study [14.9 years ± 5.3 years; 544 ± 66 kg calculated BW (mean ± SD)]. After a 4-week gradual acclimation period using sunflower oil mixed with soaked hay cubes, horses were balanced by location, age, sex, weight, and breed and randomly allocated to one of three treatment oils (CAM, OLA, or FLX) at an inclusion of 370 mg of oil/kg BW/day. Horses had ad libitum access to hay and/or pasture for the duration of the study. Body condition score (BCS), BW, oil intake, complete blood counts, plasma biochemical profiles, and plasma total lipids were measured on weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 throughout the 16-week treatment period. BW, BCS, and oil intake were analyzed using an ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS Studio. Complete blood counts and biochemical profiles were analyzed using an ANCOVA, and fatty acids were analyzed using an ANOVA in PROC MIXED in SAS Studio. No differences were observed among treatment groups for BW, BCS, oil intake, complete blood counts, and biochemical parameters. Individual fatty acids that differed among treatments and/or across time were largely reflective of the different FA profiles of the oils provided. Most notably, plasma ALA was greater for FLX than OLA, but neither differed from CAM (P = 0.01). Linoleic acid did not differ among treatments or over time (P > 0.05). The n-6:n-3 ratio decreased over time for both CAM and FLX, and ratios were lower for FLX than OLA at week 16, but not different from CAM (P = 0.02). These results suggest that dietary CAM had no adverse effects on health parameters and that daily supplementation of CAM and FLX at 370 mg of oil/kg BW/day induces positive changes (a decrease) in the n-6:n-3 status of the horse. Consequently, CAM may be considered as an alternative oil to FLX in equine diets.",

RESULTS: Serum hs-CRP concentrations significantly decreased in ORZO group (from 3.1 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.2 mg/L), as compared with CANO (p = 0.003) and SUFO (p < 0.001) groups. Serum IL-6 significantly decreased just in ORZO (- 22.8%, p = 0.042) and CANO groups (- 19.8%, p = 0.038). However, the between-group differences were not significant. Serum IL-1β slightly decreased in ORZO (- 28.1%, p = 0.11) and increased in SUFO (+ 20.6%, p = 0.079) but between-group difference was statistically significant (p = 0.017). Serum IFN-γ concentrations decreased significantly only in ORZO (from 3.3 ± 0.08 to 2.9 ± 0.21 IU/mL, p = 0.044). Salivary IgA concentrations increased significantly in all three intervention groups. Notwithstanding, only the difference between ORZO and CANO groups was statistically significant (p = 0.042). Similarly, circulating malondialdehyde concentrations significantly decreased in all three groups but with no between-group significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of ORZ-fortified canola oil, compared with unfortified canola and sunflower oils, for 12 weeks resulted in boosting of certain anti-inflammatory effects of canola oil. These findings may have preventive implications for both clinicians and policy makers. This clinical trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (03.08.2022; NCT05271045).",

      "abstract": "Camelina oil is derived from a low-input, high-yield crop and, in comparison to many other dietary fat sources currently used in equine diets, provides a greater amount of α-linolenic acid [ALA; (n-3)], than linoleic acid [LA; (n-6)]. However, no research exists assessing the effects of feeding camelina oil to horses in contrast to other commonly used oils. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of supplementing camelina oil to that of flaxseed and canola oil supplementation, on outcomes related to skin and coat health in horses. Thirty adult horses [23 mares, 7 geldings; 14.9 years ± 5.3 years; 544 ± 66 kg body weight (BW) (mean ± SD)] underwent a 4-week wash-in period consuming hay and sunflower oil. Following the wash-in period, horses were blocked by location, age, and BW, and assigned to one of three treatment oils for 16 weeks (370 mg oil/kg BW): camelina (CAM), canola (OLA), or flaxseed (FLX) oil. Blood samples were collected and plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; ELISA), nitric oxide (NO; Griess Reaction), and glycosaminoglycan (GAG; DMMB) concentrations were measured on weeks 0 (n = 30), 14 (n = 24), and 16 (n = 30). On weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured pre- and post-acetone application using a VapoMeter (n = 26), and a 5-point-Likert scale was used to assess skin and coat characteristics on the side and rump of the horses (n = 30). All data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. Independent of treatment, coat color, and quality increased from baseline. There were no differences in the outcomes assessed between the horses supplemented camelina oil and those supplemented canola or flaxseed oil. These results suggest that independent of treatment, all oil supplements improved coat color and quality in horses. This provides indication that camelina oil is comparable to existing plant-based oil supplements in supporting skin and coat health and inflammation in horses.",

      "abstract": "Canola seeds (Brassica napus L.) are among the most commonly used seeds in Mexico for vegetable oil production. This is based on the high yield and content of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. During oil bleaching, it is important to maintain fatty acids in their cis configuration because of the health concerns associated with trans-fatty acid consumption. In this sense, the industrial processing parameters employed for this purpose present some limitations, such as high temperatures and long times, which may change the cis configuration to trans. In addition, the amount of bleaching clay employed for this process could be a source of contamination because it is disposed of after treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a bleaching process for canola oil using high-power ultrasound (US). US processing was applied to nine treatments with different processing times (60, 75, and 90 min), clay percentages (1, 2, and 3%), and temperatures (60 and 80 °C) to determine the concentrations of chlorophyll a and b (µg chlo/100 g oil), carotenes (µg β-carotene/100 g oil), color (L*, a*, b*, C*, and h°), iodine value (g I2/100 g oil), and finally carrying out a spectroscopic analysis (ATR-FTIR and Raman). A conventional bleaching treatment (100 °C for 180 min, 3% bleaching clay) was used as a control. The results revealed that US treatments with 2% clay at 60 °C for 60 and 90 min eliminated most of the chlorophyll compounds (98%). However, in terms of carotenes reduction, these identical treatments exhibited a similar tendency to that of the control (approximately 30% decrease). These findings also affected the sample color, in which US treatments revealed chromatic coordinates that indicated yellow tones with chroma values that were more intense than those in the control samples. In terms of the iodine value, such treatments fulfilled the international standards for vegetable oils (90-100 g I2/100 g oil). Finally, the spectroscopic study revealed no trans configurations or the presence of different chemical compounds after US treatment, because neither of them presented typical peaks for those molecular configurations. In this regard, US can be a useful methodology for bleaching vegetable oils, helping to reduce time, and bleaching clay with similar pigment reduction results.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is regarded as a complex metabolic disorder. Recently, the role of dietary antioxidants in the underlying pathogenesis and complications of MetS has come into focus. Pistacia atlantica oil is known as a high antioxidant oil which might improve the antioxidant status of dietary oils and also oxidative stress markers. On the other hand, tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) is an approved food-grade synthetic antioxidant that acts both as an inducer and inhibitor of carcinogenesis. The current trial will explore the possible effect of a blend of Pistacia atlantica seed-canola oils, corn-canola oils with TBHQ, and corn-canola oil without TBHQ on oxidative stress markers in patients with MetS. METHODS: We will conduct a single-center, triple-blind, three-way randomized cross-over clinical trial (RCT) among 72 patients with MetS. After a 1-month run-in period, eligible participants will consume the intervention oils as their regularly consumed oils in a random order. Each intervention period will last 8 weeks separated by 4-week washout periods. Anthropometric indices, body composition, physical activity, blood pressure, and 24-h dietary food recall measurements will be assessed at the beginning and the end of each intervention period. The primary outcome will be oxidative stress markers including serum total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and the enzyme activity of myeloperoxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. The secondary outcomes will be changes in MetS components including blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and anthropometric measurements. DISCUSSION: Pistacia atlantica seed oil is high in antioxidants. An intervention with this oil could offer an option for oxidative stress prevention among patients with metabolic syndrome. The present clinical trial will be the first one assessing the impact of Pistacia atlantica oil on human oxidative stress markers.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Camelina oil contains a greater concentration of omega-3 (n-3) a-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3; ALA) than omega-6 (n-6) linoleic acid (C18:2n-6; LA), in comparison to alternative fat sources commonly used to formulate canine diets. Omega-3 FAs are frequently used to support canine skin and coat health claims and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress; however, there is a lack of research investigating camelina oil supplementation and its effects on these applications in dogs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of camelina oil supplementation on coat quality, skin barrier function, and circulating inflammatory and oxidative marker concentrations. METHODS: Thirty healthy [17 females; 13 males; 7.2 ± 3.1 years old; 27.4 ± 14.0 kg body weight (BW)] privately-owned dogs of various breeds were used. After a 4-week wash-in period consuming sunflower oil (n6:n3 = 1:0) and a commercial kibble, dogs were blocked by age, breed, and size, and randomly assigned to one of three treatment oils: camelina (n6:n3 = 1:1.18), canola (n6:n3 = 1:0.59), flaxseed (n6:n3 = 1:4.19) (inclusion level: 8.2 g oil/100 g of total food intake) in a randomized complete block design. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured using a VapoMeter on the pinna, paw pad, and inner leg. Fasted blood samples were collected to measure serum inflammatory and oxidative marker concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and spectrophotometric assays. A 5-point-Likert scale was used to assess coat characteristics. All data were collected on weeks 0, 2, 4, 10, and 16 and analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. RESULTS: No significant changes occurred in TEWL, or inflammatory and oxidative marker concentrations among treatments, across weeks, or for treatment by week interactions. Softness, shine, softness uniformity, color intensity, and follicle density of the coat increased from baseline in all treatment groups (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Outcomes did not differ (P > 0.05) among treatment groups over 16-weeks, indicating that camelina oil is comparable to existing plant-based canine oil supplements, flaxseed, and canola, at supporting skin and coat health and inflammation in dogs. Future research employing an immune or exercise challenge is warranted, as the dogs in this study were not subjected to either."

      "abstract": "Partial replacement of saturated fatty acids (SFA) with unsaturated fatty acids is recommended to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), including oleic acid, are associated with lower CVD risk. Measurement of flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) is the gold standard for measuring endothelial function and predicts CVD risk. This study examined the effect of partially replacing SFA with MUFA from conventional canola oil and high-oleic acid canola oil on FMD. Participants (n = 31) with an elevated waist circumference plus ≥1 additional metabolic syndrome criterion completed FMD measures as part of the Canola Oil Multi-Centre Intervention Trial 2 (COMIT-2), a multi-center, double-blind, three-period crossover, controlled feeding randomized trial. Diet periods were 6 weeks, separated by ≥4-week washouts. Experimental diets were provided during all feeding periods. Diets only differed by the fatty acid profile of the oils: canola oil (CO; 17.5% energy from MUFA, 9.2% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), 6.6% SFA), high-oleic acid canola oil (HOCO; 19.1% MUFA, 7.0% PUFA, 6.4% SFA), and a control oil blend (CON; 11% MUFA, 10% PUFA, 12% SFA). Multilevel models were used to examine the effect of the diets on FMD. No significant between-diet differences were observed for average brachial artery diameter (CO: 6.70 ± 0.15 mm, HOCO: 6.57 ± 0.15 mm, CON: 6.73 ± 0.14 mm; p = 0.72), peak brachial artery diameter (CO: 7.11 ± 0.15 mm, HOCO: 7.02 ± 0.15 mm, CON: 6.41 ± 0.48 mm; p = 0.80), or FMD (CO: 6.32 ± 0.51%, HOCO: 6.96 ± 0.49%, CON: 6.41 ± 0.48%; p = 0.81). Partial replacement of SFA with MUFA from CO and HOCO had no effect on FMD in participants with or at risk of metabolic syndrome.",

There was little work about the safety of food treated by PEF. The acute, subacute oral, and genetic toxicities were investigated to explore the safety of canola oil extracted by aid of PEF treatment (PTCO). The results showed that no negative consequences were caused by PEF. PTCO was regarded as practically non-toxic with a LD50 higher than 40 g/kg bw. No oil intake-related mortality, clinical, weight gain and organ coefficient abnormalities were observed. The histopathological symptoms indicated a mild load but not obvious toxicities on liver and kidney. The 28-day subacute toxicity test confirmed that less than 10 g/kg·d bw of oil intake did not exhibit any intake-related changes in physical, physiological, biochemical, hematological, and histopathological signs. The less than 4 of atherosclerosis index suggested that no risk of cardiovascular disease caused by PTCO intake.

The objective was to evaluate the effect of n-3 FA, supplemented as a fish oil product (FO) in the milk replacer (MR), in comparison to n-6 and n-9 FA, supplemented as canola oil (CO), on body weight (BW), daily gain, and immunological parameters of preweaning Holstein calves. The study was conducted from September to December 2019. Calves were randomly allocated to a control group (n = 15; BW = 36.2 ± 1.5 kg; mean ± SEM) supplemented daily with 30 mL of CO and to an experimental group (n = 15; BW = 36.3 ± 1.5 kg) supplemented with 60 g of a product containing 30 g of FO. Both treatments were added to the MR during the morning feeding. All calves were fed 4 L of MR at 12.5% solids at 0700 and 1600 h for wk 1, 6 L from wk 2 to 7, and 3 L once daily (0700 h) during wk 8 until weaning (56 d). Blood samples were collected at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 d of age for serum haptoglobin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and protectin. Dry matter intake was recorded in all experimental calves daily. Seroneutralization titers to vaccination against viral diseases (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, parainfluenza 3, bovine viral diarrhea, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus) were determined. Mixed models for repeated measures were developed to analyze variables over time. Seroneutralization titers were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The other variables were compared by a generalized linear model. Serum FA profile at 35 d of age showed that FO supported higher concentrations of n-3 FA than CO. Final BW [65.2 vs. 62.0 kg, standard error of the mean (SEM) = 2.1 kg] and average daily gain (0.52 vs. 0.46 kg/d, SEM = 0.1 kg/d) tended to be higher for the FO than the CO group. An interaction of treatment × day for dry matter intake was observed, especially during weaning (2.17 kg vs. 1.94 kg, SEM = 0.158 kg, for FO and CO group, respectively). Blood lactate (mmol/L) was higher in the CO than in the FO group at d 7. Haptoglobin and IL-1β were higher for the CO group on d 14 than the FO group. The TNF- α concentrations for the FO group were reduced over time, whereas the concentrations in the CO group remained constant. Protectin was higher in the FO group on d 14, but was lower on d 28, 35, and 49. Seroneutralization antibody titers postvaccination for the PI3 virus were higher for the FO than the CO group. In conclusion, calves supplemented with FO had lower concentrations of blood lactate, haptoglobin, IL-1β and TNF-α than calves supplemented with CO during the study period. The FO supplementation had a higher DMI than CO supplementation. Results of this trial should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of a negative control group as well as the lower birth weight and growth rate observed under heat stress conditions.",

Two of the ω3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, ω3, 20:5Δ5,8,11,14,17) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, ω3, 22:6Δ4,7,10,13,16,19) are sourced primarily from fish. Higher consumption, limited fishing quotas and other environmental factors (e.g., heavy metals) have warranted a need for alternative sources. Nuseed offers a genetically engineered canola (Brassica napus) event,1 DHA canola (OECD Unique Identifier NS-B5ØØ27-4), which has been modified to introduce a pathway for production of the ω3 LC-PUFAs DHA and EPA from oleic acid (OA) in the seed oil. To accomplish this, genes were sourced from marine microalgae and common yeast then incorporated into canola to produce DHA canola, one of the first land-based production systems for ω 3 PUFAs. Safety was evaluated in part by conducting a repeated dose 28-day toxicity study and a dietary 13-week toxicity study using CD® IGS [Crl:CD(SD)] rats. In the 28-day study, conventional and DHA canola oil were administered orally (via gavage); no treatment-related adverse effects were observed. The 13-week toxicity study was subsequently conducted where DHA canola oil and meal were administered by dietary admixture. No adverse effects were noted in clinical observations, clinical pathology, or histopathology. These studies support the food and feed safety of DHA canola oil and meal.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canola oil (Can) and several vegetable oils shorten the lifespan of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Although similar lifespan shortening has been reported for partially hydrogenated Can, the efficacy of fully hydrogenated oils on the lifespan remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the lifespan of SHRSP fed diets containing 10 % (w/w) of fully hydrogenated Can (FHCO) or other oils. METHODS: Survival test: Upon weaning, male SHRSP were fed a basal diet for rodents mixed with one of the test oils -i.e., FHCO, Can, lard (Lrd), and palm oil (Plm) throughout the experiment. The animals could freely access the diet and drinking water (water containing 1 % NaCl), and their body weight, food intake, and lifespan were recorded. Biochemical analysis test: Male SHRSP were fed a test diet with either FHCO, Can, or soybean oil (Soy) under the same condition, except to emphasize effects of fat, that no NaCl loading was applied. Soy was used as a fat source in the basal diet and was set the control group. Blood pressures was checked every 2 weeks, and serum fat levels and histological analyses of the brain and kidney were examined after 7 or 12 weeks of feeding. RESULTS: During the survival study period, the food consumption of FHCO-fed rats significantly increased (15-20 % w/w) compared with that of rats fed any other oil. However, the body weight gain in the FHCO group was significantly less (10-12 %) than that in the control group at 9-11 weeks old. The FHCO (> 180 days) intervention had the greatest effect on lifespan, followed by the Lrd (115 ± 6 days), Plm (101 ± 2 days), and Can (94 ± 3 days) diets. FHCO remarkably decreased the serum cholesterol level compared with Can and the systolic blood pressure from 12 to 16 weeks of age. In addition, while some rats in the Can group exhibited brain hemorrhaging and renal dysfunction at 16 weeks old, no symptoms were observed in the FHCO group. CONCLUSION: This current study suggests that complete hydrogenation decreases the toxicity of Can and even prolongs the lifespan in SHRSP.",

METHODS: In this randomized, triple-blind, three-way, cross-over clinical trial, participants replaced their usual oil with the intervention oils for 9 weeks. Serum fasting blood sugar, fasting serum insulin (FSI), insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), beta-cell function (HOMA2-%B), insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), as well as serum liver function enzymes were measured at baseline and end of intervention periods. RESULTS: Ninety-two participants completed all treatment periods. After adjusting for confounders, all treatment oils resulted in significant improvements in FSI and HOMA2-%S (p < 0.05). SO and SCO led to favourable changes in HOMA2-IR and QUICKI (p < 0.05). Following CO and SCO, there was a significant decrease in HOMA2-%B (p < 0.05). The sex-stratified analysis revealed that FSI and HOMA2-IR were decreased after SO compared to CO in males (p = 0.024). Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was significantly lower following SO compared to CO in females (p = 0.02), however, the difference in change values was not significant (p = 0.058). CONCLUSIONS: SO consumption appears to improve glycaemic control markers in males and serum GGT in females compared with CO in patients with type 2 diabetes (registration code: IRCT2016091312571N6).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cold-pressed camelina oil (Camelina sativa) is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and may have a beneficial effect on the reduction of cardiovascular risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the parameters contributing to the development of cardiovascular diseases, such as dietary intake, nutritional status, blood pressure, and lipid profile. Sixty postmenopausal women with dyslipidaemia were randomly assigned to two oil groups: camelina oil and canola oil. The subjects consumed daily 30 g of the test oils for 6 weeks. Before and after dietary intervention, the assessment of nutrition (4-day dietary recall), anthropometric parameters, lipid profile, and blood pressure were evaluated. RESULTS: During the dietary intervention, decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in both groups (15 mg/dl (0.4 mmol/l) reduction in the camelina oil group and 11 mg/dl (0.3 mmol/l) reduction in the canola oil group) was observed. In this study a decrease of waist circumference (approx. 1 cm) in the two groups was observed. In the group of women consuming camelina oil, a significant decrease of waist-to-hip ratio was seen. In the other anthropometric parameters no statistically significant changes were observed (body weight, body fat mass). After the intervention, no significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were noticed. CONCLUSIONS: The camelina and canola oil intake contributed to reduction of the consumption of saturated fatty acids in the diet, had a positive influence on the lipid profile parameters, and decreased the waist circumference, which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."

To increase its bioavailability, researchers supplemented genistein with dietary oils. The present study aims to compare the effectiveness of genistein supplementation with water solution or oils and find the best possible dietary oil for fortification. A total of 135 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to nine groups, including one control group and eight acetic acid-induced colitis groups. The rats in the intervention groups were treated with 5 ml per kg body weight of oral pure and genistein fortified forms of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), canola oil (CaO), and rice bran oil (RBO); the Genistein group (G) received 100 mg per kg body weight of genistein in aqueous solution orally. The colitis and control groups did not receive any treatment. The levels of colonic MDA (malondialdehyde), MPO (myeloperoxidase) activity, and IL-1β (interleukin-1β) were evaluated and a stereological analysis of colonic tissues was performed. All of the dietary oils (EVOO, CaO, and RBO) were effective at ameliorating the rats' oxidative and inflammatory status (p < 0.05); however, EVOO (with or without genistein) prescription resulted in slightly better results, especially with regard to the inflammatory profile. Additionally, delivering genistein via an oil vehicle was more efficient at reducing MDA formation, MPO activity, and IL-1β concentration than genistein in aqueous solution. The quantitative analysis of colonic tissue was consistent with the biochemical analysis. Our findings suggest that the oral administration of EVOO, canola oil, and rice bran oil can attenuate the elevated IL-1β levels and oxidative damage in induced colitis. Moreover, genistein fortified oils, especially EVOO, showed more beneficial effects in decreasing these markers in comparison with the pure oils or genistein (aqueous solution).",

Diet has an important role in the treatment of UC. This study aimed to compare the effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), as a functional food, with canola oil in the treatment of UC. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Forty patients were participating in this crossover clinical trial. Thirty two patients completed two intervention rounds. Blood samples were taken before and after 20 days intervention. Disease activity score and gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the Mayo score and gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) respectively. RESULTS: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.03) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) were decreased significantly after EVOO consumption. Bloating, constipation, fecal urgency, incomplete defecation, and final GSRS were reduced significantly after EVOO consumption (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intake of EVOO decreased the inflammatory markers and improved gastrointestinal symptoms in UC patients. It seems this functional food can be beneficial in the treatment of UC as a complementary medicine.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has compared their effects on cardiovascular risk factors. The present study aimed to assess the effect of canola, sesame, and sesame-canola oils consumption on cardio-metabolic biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This study was a randomized, triple-blind, three-way, crossover clinical trial. The study participants included 102 individuals with T2DM. Their spouses were also included in the study. The participants were entered into a 4-week run-in period. After that, their regular dietary oil was replaced with canola, sesame, or sesame-canola oils (a blend of sesame and canola oils) in three 9-week phases, which were separated by two 4-week washout periods (sunflower oil was consumed during the run-in and the washout periods). Dietary, physical activity, blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements were assessed at the beginning, in the middle (week 4-5), and at the end of each treatment phase. Blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of each phase. Serum, plasma, buffy coat, and whole blood samples were extracted and kept at -80 ºC for further analysis. Serum fasting blood sugar (FBS), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were selected as the primary outcomes. RESULTS: 102 participants with T2DM were randomly assigned to one of the 6 rolling methods. Through them, 93 individuals (91.2%) completely participated in all phases. CONCLUSION: The present study will provide an exceptional opportunity to examine the effect of canola, sesame, and sesame-canola oil on cardio-metabolic markers in adults with and without T2DM. This trial will also provide a good medium for the investigation of gene-dietary oils interaction in the future."

However, hydrogen abstraction-independent pathways are not considered by commonly applied methods despite the known reactivity of epoxides toward biomolecules. Herein, a novel liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry method was developed to detect hydroperoxidized and epoxidized triacylglycerols (TAGs) without derivatization or hydrolyzation of food samples. Epoxidized TAGs could be detected in refined canola oil at concentrations of 96.8 ± 2.08 μM, while only 5.77 ± 0.04 μM hydroperoxidized TAGs could be determined. In contrast to canola oil, margarine was more resistant to lipid oxidation since generation of epoxidized TAGs could only be marginally enhanced from 21.7 ± 0.48 to 28.8 ± 0.64 μM in margarine after treatment at 180 °C for 60 min, as also reflected by a peroxide value of 0.80 ± 0.00 mequiv O2/kg, which remained unchanged. The new method allows the assessment of food safety by the simultaneous measurement of hydroperoxidized and epoxidized TAGs without hydrolysis and laborious sample preparation.",

      "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of oxidized canola oil and tannic acid (TA) supplementation on nutrient digestibility and microbial metabolites in finishing pigs. Four experimental diets were formulated to include 5% of either fresh canola oil (0 mEq/kg of peroxide value) or oxidized canola oil (180 mEq/kg of peroxide value). An equal portion of each diet was supplemented with 0.1% TA. Eight pigs (initial body weight of 82.89 ± 2.26 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum. At the beginning of the experiments, all pigs were fed a nitrogen-free diet for 7 d. Then, they were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to an incomplete replicated 4 × 3 Latin square design with 3 periods to give 6 replicates per treatment. Each experimental period lasted for 9 d, starting with a 5-d adaptation period followed by 2 consecutive 2-d periods for fecal (day 6 and day 7) and ileal digesta (day 8 and day 9) collection. The inclusion of oxidized oil reduced (P < 0.05) the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Pro and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of NDF. Also, pigs fed the oxidized oil tended to have lower (P ≤ 0.10) lactate and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in the ileum and lower (P ≤ 0.10) acetate and propionate concentrations in the feces than those fed the fresh oil. The supplementation of 0.1% TA reduced (P < 0.05) the AID of NDF and the ATTD of gross energy, crude protein, and NDF. Additionally, the TA-supplemented diet tended to have a lower (P ≤ 0.10) digestible energy content than the nonsupplemented diet. Pigs fed the TA-supplemented diet showed reduced (P < 0.05) AID and SID of His, Cys, and Pro compared with those fed the nonsupplemented diet. There were interactive effects (P < 0.05) of oxidized oil and TA supplementation on acetate, isovalerate, total short chain fatty acids, and pH level in the ileum. In conclusion, the results indicated that the effects of oxidized oil are greater on microbial activities rather than nutrient digestibility. Although negative effects of dietary TA supplementation were observed in relation to nutrient digestibility, TA supplementation was found to ameliorate these negative effects of oxidized oil on microbial metabolites. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the interaction between dietary oxidized oil and TA in relation with the gut microbiota in pigs.",

However, thermo-sensitivity, lipophilicity and formulation-dependent efficacy bring challenges in the development of functional foods, enriched with phytosterols and tocopherols. To address this, we developed liposomes containing brassicasterol, campesterol and β-sitosterol obtained from canola oil deodorizer distillate, along with alpha, gamma and delta tocopherol. Three approaches; thin film hydration-homogenization, thin film hydration-ultrasonication and Mozafari method were used for formulation. Validated liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was utilized to determine the entrapment efficiency of bioactives. Stability studies of liposomal formulations were conducted before and after pasteurization using high temperature short time (HTST) technique for a month. Vesicle size after homogenization and ultrasonication (<200 nm) was significantly lower than by Mozafari method (>200 nm). However, zeta potential (-9 to -14 mV) was comparable which was adequate for colloidal stability. Entrapment efficiencies were greater than 89% for all the phytosterols and tocopherols formulated by all three methods. Liposomes with optimum particle size and zeta potential were incorporated in model orange juice, showing adequate stability after pasteurization (72 °C for 15 s) for a month. Liposomes containing phytosterols obtained from canola waste along with tocopherols were developed and successfully applied as a food additive using model orange juice."

The effect of applied current density and operation time in the removal of organic pollutants were investigated and discussed. Total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total suspended solids (TSS) were measured. Using only EC process was found to be significantly successful in removing suspended and colloidal pollutants and could remove more than 90% TCOD and 80% of TOC at current densities between 0.91 and 13.66 mA cm-2. From the statistical model, the optimized conditions for TCOD at a current density of 7.61 mA cm-2 and TOC at 7.99 mA cm-2 under 40 min operation, validated to remove 93.45% and 94.5% respectively. However, the maximum removal of dissolved organic pollutants was relatively low in EC process and reported to be 75% for sCOD and 74% for DOC. Therefore, EC + EO process were run to increase the removal of sCOD and DOC to 99 and 95%, respectively. On the other hand, treatment using ECP process achieved a removal of sCOD and DOC between 77 and 86%. TSS were removed completely in both EC + EO and ECP processes. A statistical model was applied to compare the performance of two methods and found that the combined EC + EO process provided lightly better treatment compared to ECP method.",

      "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia is a well- known risk factor of cardiovascular disease. A healthy diet containing vegetable oils such as canola oil (CO) may help to reduce serum lipids. This study aimed to quantify the effects of CO on lipid parameters using a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and Embase were systematically searched until December 2017, with no time and design restrictions. Also, a manual search was performed to find extra relevant articles. Lipid parameters including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) were entered the meta-analysis. Weighed mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were stated as the effect size. Sensitivity analyses and prespecified subgroup were conducted to evaluate potential heterogeneity. Twenty-seven trials, comprising 1359 participants, met the eligibility criteria. Results of this study showed that CO consumption significantly reduced TC (-7.24 mg/dl, 95% CI, -12.1 to -2.7), and LDL (-6.4 mg/dl, 95% CI, -10.8 to -2), although it had no effects on HDL, TG, Apo B, and Apo A1. Effects of CO on TC and LDL significantly decreased after CO consumption in subgroups of >50 years of age participants and >30 intervention duration subgroup. Moreover, CO decreased LDL and TC compared to sunflower oil and saturated fat. This meta-analysis suggested that CO consumption improves serum TC and LDL, which could postpone heart disease progression. Key Teaching Points CO consumption could decrease serum TC and LDL, although it had no effects on other blood lipids. There was an overall significant effect of canola oil on TC and LDL compared to sunflower oil and saturated fats. CO could have beneficial effects on serum TC and LDL just when consumed longer than 30 days. CO consumption improved lipid profiles in participants older than 50 years.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cholesterol efflux plays an important role in preventing atherosclerosis progression. Vegetable oils with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles favorably affect multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors; however, their effects on cholesterol efflux remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of diets low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles on serum-mediated cholesterol efflux and its association with the plasma lipophilic index and central obesity. METHODS: The present study is a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Participants [men: n = 50; women: n = 51; mean ± SE age: 49.5 ± 1.2 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 29.4 ± 0.4] at risk for or with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were randomly assigned to 5 isocaloric diets containing the treatment oils: canola oil, high oleic acid-canola oil, DHA-enriched high oleic acid-canola oil, corn oil and safflower oil blend, and flax oil and safflower oil blend. These treatment oils were incorporated into smoothies that participants consumed 2 times/d. For a 3000-kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil was required to provide 18% of total energy per day. Each diet period was 4 wk followed by a 2- to 4-wk washout period. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity with a validated ex vivo high-throughput cholesterol efflux assay. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the SAS mixed-model procedure. RESULTS: The 5 diets increased serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 macrophages similarly by 39%, 34%, 55%, 49% and 51%, respectively, compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Waist circumference and abdominal adiposity were negatively correlated with serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (r = -0.25, P = 0.01, r = -0.33, P = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: Diets low in SFAs with different monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles improved serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity in individuals with or at risk for MetS. This mechanism may account, in part, for the cardiovascular disease benefits of diets low in SFAs and high in unsaturated fatty acids. Importantly, central obesity is inversely associated with cholesterol efflux capacity. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01351012.",

Physical characterization was done and oxidative stability of the oleogels were evaluated. As the proportion of wax increased from 5 to 15%, the enthalpy of crystallization and melting increased in both oleogels. The carnauba wax-based oleogel (CWO) required greater enthalpy than the beeswax-based oleogel (BWO). Differences in L*, a*, and b* values between control oils and the oleogels significantly decreased as the concentration of wax increased in the oleogels (5-15%; p<0.05). Oil-binding capacity of the BWO was higher than that of the CWO. Solid-fat content of the CWO did not change significantly from 10 to 60oC, whereas that of the BWO decreased. In general, oxidative stability of the CWO was better at 60 and 180oC heat treatment in comparison with control oils (p<0.05). However, the BWO did not provide high oxidative stability than the control oils."

The objective of this sub-study of a double-blinded randomized crossover clinical study, the canola oil multi-center intervention trial, was to investigate effects of five different novel oil blends fed for 30 days each on the intestinal microbiota in 25 volunteers with risk of metabolic syndrome. The 60 g treatments included three MUFA-rich diets: (1) conventional canola oil (Canola); (2) DHA-enriched high oleic canola oil (CanolaDHA); (3) high oleic canola oil (CanolaOleic); and two PUFA-rich diets: (4) a blend of corn/saﬄower oil (25:75) (CornSaff); and (5) a blend of flax/saﬄower oil (60:40) (FlaxSaff). Stool samples were collected at the end of each period. DNA was extracted and amplified for 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. A total of 17 phyla and 187 genera were identified. While five novel oil treatments failed to alter bacterial phyla composition, obese participants resulted in a higher proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes than overweight or normal weight groups (P = 0.01). Similarly at the genus level, overall bacterial distribution was highly associated with subjects' body mass index (BMI). Treatment effects were observed between MUFA- and PUFA-rich diets, with the three MUFA diets elevating Parabacteroides, Prevotella, Turicibacter, and Enterobacteriaceae's populations, while the two PUFA-rich diets favored the higher abundance of Isobaculum. High MUFA content feedings also resulted in an increase of Parabacteroides and a decrease of Isobaculum in obese, but not overweight subjects. Data suggest that BMI is a predominant factor in characterization of human gut microbiota profile, and that MUFA-rich and PUFA-rich diets impact the composition of gut microbiota at lower taxonomical levels mainly in obese subjects."

However, an undesirable odor and an unpalatable taste unique to soybean oil were two major disadvantages of the method. This study was carried out to find an alternative vegetable oil that is cost effective, labor effective, and efficient without leaving an undesirable taste and smell. METHODS: We employed six vegetable oils that were available at a grocery store. A 1-mL sample of the corresponding oil containing a total of 32 pesticides, representing four categories, was mixed with 10% aqueous ginseng extract (20 mL) and equivalent vegetable oil (7 mL) in Falcon tubes. The final concentration of the pesticides in the mixture (28 mL) was adjusted to approximately 2 ppm. In addition, pesticides for spiking were clustered depending on the analytical equipment (GC/HPLC), detection mode (electron capture detector/nitrogen-phosphorus detector), or retention time used. Samples were harvested and subjected to quantitative analysis of the pesticides. RESULTS: Soybean oil demonstrated the highest efficiency in partitioning pesticide residues in the ginseng extract to the oil phase. However, canola oil gave the best result in an organoleptic test due to the lack of undesirable odor and unpalatable taste. Furthermore, the qualitative and quantitative changes of ginsenosides evaluated by TLC and HPLC, respectively, revealed no notable change before or after canola oil treatment. CONCLUSION: We suggest that canola oil is an excellent vehicle with respect to its organoleptic property, cost-effectiveness and efficiency of eliminating pesticide residues in ginseng extract."

However, the action of dietary fat composition on PCSK9 levels remains to be fully elucidated. The objective was to investigate the action of different dietary oils on circulating PCSK9 levels in the Canola Oil Multicenter Intervention Trial (COMIT). COMIT employed a double-blinded crossover randomized control design, consisting of five 30-d treatment periods. Diets were provided based on a 3000Kcal/d intake, including a 60g/d treatment of conventional canola oil (Canola), a high oleic canola/DHA oil blend (CanolaDHA), a corn/safflower oil blend (CornSaff), a flax/safflower oil blend (FlaxSaff) or a high oleic canola oil (CanolaOleic). Plasma PCSK9 levels were assessed using ELISA at the end of each phase. Lipid profiles (n=84) showed that CanolaDHA feeding resulted in the highest (P<0.05) serum total cholesterol (TC, 5.06±0.09mmol/L) and LDL-cholesterol levels (3.15±0.08mmol/L) across all five treatments. CanolaDHA feeding also produced the lowest (P<0.05) plasma PCSK9 concentrations (216.42±8.77ng/mL) compared to other dietary oil treatments. Plasma PCSK9 levels positively correlated (P<0.05) with serum TC, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A, and apolipoprotein B levels but did not correlate to HDL-cholesterol levels. Results indicate that post-treatment response in PCSK9 may be altered with the CanolaDHA diet. In conclusion, the elevated LDL-C levels from a DHA oil treatment may not be relevant for the observed decline in PCSK9 levels.",

We aimed to compare the effects of CO and RBO consumption on blood lipids in women with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Seventy-five postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes participated in this single-center, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial in Shiraz, Iran. Participants were randomly allocated to three groups including a control group (balance diet + 30 g/d sunflower oil) and two intervention groups (balance diet + 30 g/day CO or RBO). At baseline and after 8 weeks, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured. RESULTS: At 8 weeks, mean of serum levels of TG (mg/dL), TC (mg/dL), and LDL-C (mg/dL) significantly decreased in the CO group (-23.66, P < .001; -11.92, P < .001; and -6.33, P = .013, respectively) and RBO group (-38.62, P < .001; -17.25, P < .001; and -8.90, P = .002, respectively) compared with the controls (7.01, 4.06, and 2.90, respectively). Also, in comparison with CO group, the changes of TG, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C levels were significantly more in the RBO group (P = .007, P = .012, and P = .011, respectively). Levels of serum HDL-C remained unchanged in all groups at the end of study. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of RBO or CO for sunflower oil could attenuate lipid disorders in type 2 diabetes women. Moreover, RBO could improve lipid profile more efficiently than CO.",

Eighteen Holstein cows with an average daily milk yield of 22 (± 4) kg/d in the middle stage of lactation were used. The cows were distributed in 6 contemporary 3x3 Latin squares consisting of 3 periods and 3 treatments: control diet (without oil), 3% inclusion of canola oil in the diet and 6% inclusion of canola oil in the diet (dry matter basis). The inclusion of 6% canola oil in the diet of lactating cows linearly reduced the milk yield by 2.51 kg/d, short-chain fatty acids (FA) by 41.42%, medium chain FA by 27.32%, saturated FA by 20.24%, saturated/unsaturated FA ratio by 39.20%, omega-6/omega-3 ratio by 39.45%, and atherogenicity index by 48.36% compared with the control treatment. Moreover, with the 6% inclusion of canola oil in the diet of cows, there was an increase in the concentration of long chain FA by 45.91%, unsaturated FA by 34.08%, monounsaturated FA by 40.37%, polyunsaturated FA by 17.88%, milk concentration of omega-3 by 115%, rumenic acid (CLA) by 16.50%, oleic acid by 44.87% and h/H milk index by 94.44% compared with the control treatment.

The study aimed to investigate whether tocotrienols improves glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and oxidative stress in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. A total of 50 patients, aged 35-60 years, with T2DM treated by noninsulin hypoglycemic drugs were randomly assigned to receive either 15 mL/day tocotrienols (200 mg) enriched canola oil (n = 25) or pure canola oil (n = 25) for 8 weeks. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined before and after the intervention. The data were compared between and within groups, before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of participants including age, sex, physical activity, disease duration, and type of drug consumption were not significantly different between the two groups. In tocotrienol enriched canola oil, FBS (mean percent change: -15.4% vs. 3.9%; P = 0.006) and MDA (median percent change: -35.6% vs. 16.3%; P = 0.003) were significantly reduced while TAC was significantly increased (median percent change: 21.4% vs. 2.3%; P = 0.001) compared to pure canola oil. At the end of the study, patients who treated with tocotrienols had lower FBS (P = 0.023) and MDA (P = 0.044) compared to the pure canola oil group. However, tocotrienols had no effect on insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR. CONCLUSION: Tocotrienols can improve FBS concentrations and modifies redox balance in T2DM patients with poor glycemic control and can be considered in combination with hypoglycemic drugs to better control of T2DM."

Foods with a combination of HOCO-DHA and barley β-glucan have never been tested for their effects on CVD risk. The objective is to determine the effects of consuming novel foods HOCO-DHA, and barley β-glucan on managing CVD risk factors in people with MetS. METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a randomized, single-blind crossover trial with four treatment phases of 28 days each separated by a 4-week washout interval. Participants (n=35) will be provided with weight-maintaining, healthy balanced diet recommendations according to their energy requirements during the intervention periods. Participants will receive muffins and cookies as treatment foods in a random order and will consume at least one meal per day at the research center under supervision. The four treatments include muffins and cookies consisting of (1) all-purpose flour and HOCO-DHA (50 g/day); (2) barley flour (4.36 g/day of β-glucan) and a blend of sunflower oil, safflower oil, and butter as control oil (50 g/day); (3) barley flour (4.36 g/day of β-glucan) and HOCO-DHA (50 g/day; dosage of DHA would be 3 g/day); and (4) all-purpose flour and control oil (50 g/day). At the beginning and end of each phase, we will evaluate anthropometrics; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; blood lipid profile; low-density lipoprotein subfractions and particle size; 10-year Framingham CVD risk score; inflammatory status; and plasma and red blood cell fatty acid profiles, fecal microbiome, and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. CONCLUSION: Cholesterol synthesis will also be studied, using a stable isotope approach. The proposed study will lead to innovation of novel food products, which may result in improvement in the overall cardiovascular health of humans.

The total phenolic and tocopherol content and antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined and compared with TBHQ by DPPH assay and β-carotene bleaching method. The results show that the extract from ethanol: water (50:50) ultrasonic treatment with high amount of phenols (919.66 mg gallic acid/g extract, tocopherols (438.4 μg α-tocopherol/ mL extract) indicated the highest antioxidant activity (80.36 % radical scavenging and 62.69 % β-carotene-linoleic bleaching) and thermal stability (4.95 h) at 120 °C in canola oil. Being high in antioxidant and antiradical potential and high content of phenolic and tocopherol compounds of ethanol: water (50:50) ultrasonic extract caused to evaluate its thermal stability at 180 °C in canola oil during frying process. So, different concentrations of Tarom Mahali rice bran extract (100, 800, and 1200 ppm) were added to canola oil. TBHQ at 100 ppm served as standard besides the control. Free fatty acids (FFAs), Peroxide value (PV), carbonyl value (CV), total polar compounds (TPC) and oxidative stability index (OSI) were taken as parameters for evaluation of effectiveness of Tarom Mahali rice bran extract in stabilization of canola oil. Results from different parameters were in agreement with each other, suggesting that 800 ppm of the extract could act better than 100 ppm TBHQ in inhibition of lipid oxidation in canola oil during frying process and can be used as predominant alternative of synthetic antioxidants."

      "abstract": "Oleic acid consumption is considered cardio-protective according to studies conducted examining effects of the Mediterranean diet. However, animal models have shown that oleic acid consumption increases LDL particle cholesteryl oleate content which is associated with increased LDL-proteoglycan binding and atherosclerosis. The objective was to examine effects of varying oleic, linoleic and docosahexaenoic acid consumption on human LDL-proteoglycan binding in a non-random subset of the Canola Oil Multi-center Intervention Trial (COMIT) participants. COMIT employed a randomized, double-blind, five-period, cross-over trial design. Three of the treatment oil diets: 1) a blend of corn/safflower oil (25:75); 2) high oleic canola oil; and 3) DHA-enriched high oleic canola oil were selected for analysis of LDL-proteoglycan binding in 50 participants exhibiting good compliance. LDL particles were isolated from frozen plasma by gel filtration chromatography and LDL cholesteryl esters quantified by mass-spectrometry. LDL-proteoglycan binding was assessed using surface plasmon resonance. LDL particle cholesterol ester fatty acid composition was sensitive to the treatment fatty acid compositions, with the main fatty acids in the treatments increasing in the LDL cholesterol esters. The corn/safflower oil and high-oleic canola oil diets lowered LDL-proteoglycan binding relative to their baseline values (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0012, respectively). At endpoint, high-oleic canola oil feeding resulted in lower LDL-proteoglycan binding than corn/safflower oil (p = 0.0243) and DHA-enriched high oleic canola oil (p = 0.0249), although high-oleic canola oil had the lowest binding at baseline (p = 0.0344). Our findings suggest that high-oleic canola oil consumption in humans increases cholesteryl oleate percentage in LDL, but in a manner not associated with a rise in LDL-proteoglycan binding.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The supplementation of fat to lactating dairy cows has long been used as a management tool to increase dietary energy density for improving cow production, reproduction and to alleviate negative energy balance. Attempts have been made to investigate the effect of canola meal on plasma metabolites in lactating cows, but the results have been diverse and inconsistent. To our current knowledge, there is a dearth of published information on the utilization of Crude Degummed Canola Oil (CDCO) in pasture-based dairy systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the changes in plasma metabolite profiles of pasture-based, primiparous, Holstein-Friesian cows supplemented with varying dietary levels of CDCO for eight weeks. The study tested the hypothesis that feeding grazing primiparous Holstein-Friesian cows for eight weeks with incremental levels of CDCO supplement will decrease plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), but increase plasma cholesterol and glucose metabolites. RESULTS: Twenty lactating primiparous Holstein-Friesian cows 40 days in milk were randomly allotted into four treatment groups that consisted of a wheat-based, pelleted basal diet with no supplemental CDCO (control), basal diet with CDCO added at 25 ml/kgDM (DM; dry matter) (low), 35 ml/kgDM (medium) and 50 ml/kgDM (high) in an eight-week feeding trial, after two weeks of adjustment. Treatment influenced BHBA but had no effect on plasma NEFA, cholesterol and glucose metabolite profiles (P > 0.05). However, week of supplementation had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on BHBA, NEFA and glucose concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that with the exception of BHBA, CDCO at current levels of supplementation does not alter the plasma metabolite profiles of grazing primiparous cows. The lack of significant differences across treatments seems to indicate that higher levels of CDCO than the current levels used in this study, are probably needed. Furthermore, the duration of supplementation with CDCO had a greater impact on plasma metabolites than the levels of supplementation. Our findings also suggest that primiparous cows grazing high quality pastures during spring have sufficient energy intakes to prevent negative energy balance at 40 days in milk without the need for added fat supplements.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little is known about the effect of various dietary fatty acids on pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. We investigated the effect of 5 oils containing various amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on plasma inflammatory biomarkers and expression levels of key inflammatory genes and transcription factors in whole blood cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized, crossover controlled nutrition intervention, 114 adult men and women with abdominal obesity and at least one other criterion for the metabolic syndrome consumed 5 experimental isoenergetic diets for 4 weeks each, separated by 4-week washout periods. Each diet provided 60 g/3000 kcal of different oils: 1) control corn/safflower oil blend (CornSaff; LA-rich), 2) flax/safflower oil blend (FlaxSaff; ALA-rich), 3) conventional canola oil (Canola; OA-rich), 4) high oleic canola oil (CanolaOleic; highest OA content), 5) DHA-enriched high oleic canola oil (CanolaDHA; OA- and DHA-rich). Gene expression in whole blood cells was assessed in a subset of 62 subjects. CanolaDHA increased plasma adiponectin concentrations compared with the control CornSaff oil treatment (+4.5%, P = 0.04) and FlaxSaff (+6.9%, P = 0.0008). CanolaDHA also reduced relative expression levels of interleukin (IL)1B compared with CornSaff and Canola (-11% and -13%, respectively, both P = 0.03). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations were lower after Canola than after FlaxSaff (-17.8%, P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: DHA-enriched canola oil exerts anti-inflammatory effects compared with polyunsaturated fatty acids from plant sources.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the daily intake of 200 mg T3 added in canola oil over 8 weeks on microalbuminuria, inflammation, and nitrosative stress in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: This study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. A total of 50 patients with T2DM and FBS >126 mg/dl treated by non-insulin hypoglycemic drugs were randomly assigned to receive either 15 ml T3-enriched canola oil (200 mg/day T3) or pure canola oil for 8 weeks. Urine microalbumin, volume and creatinine levels, serum hs-CRP, and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured before and after intervention. RESULTS: From 50 patients participated in this study, 44 completed the study. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, dietary intake, and physical activity between groups. Urine microalbumin and serum hs-CRP were declined significantly in T3-treated group. At the end of the study, patients who treated with T3 had lower urine microalbumin (11 (9, 25) vs. 22 (15, 39.75) nmol/dl, P = 0.003) and hs-CRP changes (-10.91 ± 15.5 vs. -9.88 ± 27.5 Pg/ml, P = 0.048) than control group. A non-significant decrease was also observed in serum NO level in T3-treated group with no changes in urine volume and creatinine levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that T3 leads to ameliorate proteinuria and can protect the kidney against inflammation (hs-CRP) and nitrosative stress (NO)."

We therefore determined the combined effect of ALA, MUFA, and low GL on glycemic control and CVD risk factors in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a parallel design, randomized trial wherein each 3-month treatment was conducted in a Canadian academic center between March 2011 and September 2012 and involved 141 participants with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6.5%-8.5% [48-69 mmol/mol]) treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents. Participants were provided with dietary advice on either a low-GL diet with ALA and MUFA given as a canola oil-enriched bread supplement (31 g canola oil per 2,000 kcal) (test) or a whole-grain diet with a whole-wheat bread supplement (control). The primary outcome was HbA1c change. Secondary outcomes included calculated Framingham CVD risk score and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) ratio. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the test group and 90% of the control group completed the trial. The test diet reduction in HbA1c units of -0.47% (-5.15 mmol/mol) (95% CI -0.54% to -0.40% [-5.92 to -4.38 mmol/mol]) was greater than that for the control diet (-0.31% [-3.44 mmol/mol] [95% CI -0.38% to -0.25% (-4.17 to -2.71 mmol/mol)], P = 0.002), with the greatest benefit observed in those with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP). Greater reductions were seen in CVD risk score for the test diet, whereas the RHI ratio increased for the control diet. CONCLUSIONS: A canola oil-enriched low-GL diet improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, particularly in participants with raised SBP, whereas whole grains improved vascular reactivity.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effects of varying n-9, n-6, and longer-chain n-3 fatty acid composition on markers of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, 5-period, crossover design was used. Each 4-wk treatment period was separated by 4-wk washout intervals. Volunteers with abdominal obesity consumed each of 5 identical weight-maintaining, fixed-composition diets with one of the following treatment oils (60 g/3000 kcal) in beverages: 1) conventional canola oil (Canola; n-9 rich), 2) high-oleic acid canola oil with docosahexaenoic acid (CanolaDHA; n-9 and n-3 rich), 3) a blend of corn and safflower oil (25:75) (CornSaff; n-6 rich), 4) a blend of flax and safflower oils (60:40) (FlaxSaff; n-6 and short-chain n-3 rich), or 5) high-oleic acid canola oil (CanolaOleic; highest in n-9). RESULTS: One hundred thirty individuals completed the trial. At endpoint, total cholesterol (TC) was lowest after the FlaxSaff phase (P < 0.05 compared with Canola and CanolaDHA) and highest after the CanolaDHA phase (P < 0.05 compared with CornSaff, FlaxSaff, and CanolaOleic). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were highest, and triglycerides were lowest, after CanolaDHA (P < 0.05 compared with the other diets). All diets decreased TC and LDL cholesterol from baseline to treatment endpoint (P < 0.05). CanolaDHA was the only diet that increased HDL cholesterol from baseline (3.5 ± 1.8%; P < 0.05) and produced the greatest reduction in triglycerides (-20.7 ± 3.8%; P < 0.001) and in systolic blood pressure (-3.3 ± 0.8%; P < 0.001) compared with the other diets (P < 0.05). Percentage reductions in Framingham 10-y CHD risk scores (FRS) from baseline were greatest after CanolaDHA (-19.0 ± 3.1%; P < 0.001) than after other treatments (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Consumption of CanolaDHA, a novel DHA-rich canola oil, improves HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure, thereby reducing FRS compared with other oils varying in unsaturated fatty acid composition.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Canola Oil Multicenter Intervention Trial (COMIT) was a randomized controlled crossover study designed to evaluate the effects of five diets that provided different oils and/or oil blends on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in individuals with abdominal obesity. The present objective is to report preliminary findings on plasma fatty acid profiles in volunteers with abdominal obesity, following the consumption of diets enriched with n-3, n-6 and n-9 fatty acids. METHODS: COMIT was conducted at three clinical sites, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Québec City, Québec, Canada and University Park, Pennsylvania, United States. Inclusion criteria were at least one of the followings: waist circumference (≥90 cm for males and ≥84 cm for females), and at least one other criterion: triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/L, high density lipoprotein cholesterol <1 mmol/L (males) or <1.3 mmol/L (females), blood pressure ≥130 mmHg (systolic) and/or ≥85 mmHg (diastolic), and glucose ≥5.5 mmol/L. Weight-maintaining diets that included shakes with one of the dietary oil blends were provided during each of the five 30-day dietary phases. Dietary phases were separated by four-week washout periods. Treatment oils were canola oil, high oleic canola oil, high oleic canola oil enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), flax oil and safflower oil blend, and corn oil and safflower oil blend. A per protocol approach with a mixed model analysis was decided to be appropriate for data analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy volunteers were randomized and 130 completed the study with a dropout rate of 23.5%. The mean plasma total DHA concentrations, which were analyzed among all participants as a measure of adherence, increased by more than 100% in the DHA-enriched phase, compared to other phases, demonstrating excellent dietary adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention strategies were effective in achieving a sufficient number of participants who completed the study protocol to enable sufficient statistical power to resolve small differences in outcome measures. It is expected that the study will generate important data thereby enhancing our understanding of the effects of n-3, n-6, and n-9 fatty acid-containing oils on CVD risks.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microwave heating is one of the most attractive cooking methods for food preparation, commonly employed in households and especially in restaurants for its high speed and convenience. The chemical constituents of oils that degrade during microwave heating do so at rates that vary with heating temperature and time in a similar manner to other type of processing methods. The rate of quality characteristics of the oil depends on the fatty acid composition and the minor components during heating. Addition of oxidative-stable palm olein (PO) to heat sensitive canola oil (CO), may affect the quality characteristics of CO during microwave heating. The aim of this study was to evaluate how heat treatments by microwave oven affect the quality of CO in presence of PO. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The blend was prepared in the volume ratio of 40:60 (PO:CO, PC). Microwave heating test was performed for different periods (2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 min) at medium power setting for the samples of CO and PC. The changes in quality characteristics of the samples during heating were determined by analytical and instrumental methods. RESULTS: In this study, refractive index, free fatty acid content, peroxide value, p-anisidine value, TOTOX value, specific extinction, viscosity, polymer content, polar compounds and food oil sensor value of the oils all increased, whereas iodine value and C₁₈.₂ /C₁₆:₀ ratio decreased as microwave heating progressed. Based on the most oxidative stability criteria, PO addition led to a slower deterioration of CO at heating temperatures. The effect of microwave heating on the fatty acid composition of the samples was not remarkable. PO addition decelerated the formation of primary and secondary oxidation products in CO. However, effect of adding PO to CO on the formation of free fatty acids and polymers during microwave treatment was not significant (P < 0.05). No significant difference in food oil sensor value was detected between CO and PC throughout the heating periods. CONCLUSION: Microwave heating caused formation of comparatively lower amounts of some degradative products in PC compared to CO indicating a lower extent of oxidative degradation of PC.",

Here, we investigated the effect of maternal (pregnancy plus lactation) dietary canola oil on the susceptibility of female Sprague-Dawley rat offspring to mammary carcinogenesis. Although the control diet had 10% soybean oil, the treatment diet was formulated to contain 10% canola oil as a fat source. N-nitroso-N-methylurea was injected to induce mammary cancer in offspring. The offspring of canola-fed dams showed significantly decreased tumor multiplicity (1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 1.9 ± 0.3, respectively; P = 0.04) and tumor volume (1232.5 ± 771.0 mm(3) vs. 6,302.5 ± 1,747.4 mm(3), respectively; P = 0.01), along with increased survival rate (87% vs. 47%, respectively; P = 0.01). In addition, the mRNA expression of development-related gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 was significantly higher in the lactating mammary tissues of the canola group dams and mammary tumor tissues of the offspring [2.5 ± 0.6 vs. 0.5 ± 0.2, respectively (P = 0.01) and 0.98 ± 0.03 vs. 0.56 ± 0.15, respectively (P = 0.05)]. These results suggest a potential anticancer effect of maternal dietary canola oil and may be useful in devising prenatal nutritional strategies to reduce breast cancer risk in humans.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine if 25 days of canola oil intake in the absence of excess dietary salt or together with salt loading affects antioxidant and oxidative stress markers in the circulation. A further aim was to determine the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms in the aorta of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats. METHODS: Male SHRSP rats, were fed a defatted control diet containing 10% wt/wt soybean oil or a defatted treatment diet containing 10% wt/wt canola oil, and given tap water or water containing 1% NaCl. Blood was collected at the end of study for analysis of red blood cell (RBC) antioxidant enzymes, RBC and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), plasma 8-isoprostane and plasma lipids. The aorta was removed and the mRNA expression of NOX2, p22phox, CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD and EC-SOD were determined. RESULTS: In the absence of salt, canola oil reduced RBC SOD and glutathione peroxidase, and increased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared with soybean oil. RBC glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in both the salt loaded groups compared to the soybean oil only group. In addition, RBC MDA and plasma HDL cholesterol were significantly higher in both the salt loaded groups compared to the no salt groups. Plasma MDA concentration was higher and LDL cholesterol concentration lower in the canola oil group loaded with salt compared to the canola oil group without salt. The mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and SOD isoforms were significantly reduced in the canola oil group with salt compared to canola oil group without salt. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these results indicate that canola oil reduces antioxidant status and increases plasma lipids, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, canola oil in combination with salt intake increased MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation and decreased NAPDH oxidase subunits and aortic SOD gene expression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Canola oil is a variety of rapeseed oil low in erucic acid (<2%). For many years, canola oil has been widely used as an ingredient in infant formula in Europe, but not in North America due to safety concerns. A number of studies have used variable canola content of infant formulas to investigate the effects of linoleic acid: α-linolenic acid ratio on visual function of infants. However, little published data is available to compare the safety of canola versus non-canola containing infant formula. The aim of this study is to investigate whether infant formulas containing canola oil support normal growth in infants as assessed by weight and length gain. METHODS: Re-analyses of data on infant weight and length gain from a prospective randomized double-blind trial in full-term infants in the German Infant Nutritional Intervention study (GINI). This analysis compared growth in infants receiving infant formulas with or without canola oil from week 4 to month 7. Absolute weight and length, weight and length gain in gram or cm per day and standardized weight and length measurements were analyzed by analyses of variance and a longitudinal random effects model. Standardization was conducted according to the new WHO 2006 age- and sex-specific child growth standards. RESULTS: Absolute and standardized weight and length measures did not differ between the formula groups with or without canola oil. This was true for both, analyses within each of the three anthropometric measurement periods (4-6 weeks, 3-4 months, 6-7 months) and for the longitudinal analyses over the whole period from 4 weeks to 7 months of life. Power analyses confirmed that sample size was sufficient to detect a difference of 3 g per day between 14 and 120 days between the two formula groups. CONCLUSIONS: Infant formula containing canola oil supports normal infant growth as assessed by weight and length gain.",

      "abstract": "Phytosterols (PSs) have been recently added to various mediums. Nevertheless, matrices with functional properties, such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), should be precisely examined for supplementary advantages. The objective of this study was to identify the existence of combined biological actions of a functional oil enriched in PSs within MCTs and high-oleic canola (HOC), relative to a control (olive oil), in overweight, hyperlipidemic men using a rigorously controlled dietary intervention. Twenty-three overweight, hyperlipidemic men consumed both types of oil in a randomized, crossover trial for 6 weeks each. Fasted plasma samples were collected on the first and last 2 days of each study period. Body weight decreased -1.22 +/- 0.35 kg (P = .0019) and -1.68 +/- 0.47 kg (P = .0016) after the 6-week study period in the olive oil and functional oil groups, respectively. The end points for total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the functional oil group (P = .0006) were lower than in the olive oil group (P = .0002). Total cholesterol values decreased from comparable baseline to end point of 4.71 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (P < .0001) in the functional oil phase and 5.14 +/- 0.19 mmol/L (P = .0001) in the olive oil phase (P = .0592). In addition, LDL-C demonstrated a similar drop, to an end point of 3.12 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (P < .0001) and 3.54 +/- 0.18 mmol/L (P = .0002), for the functional oil and olive oil groups, respectively, with significant changes (P = .0221). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not change in either treatment. Triacylglycerol end points decreased in functional oil and olive oil groups (P = .0195 and .0105, respectively) to the same extent from baseline. Results indicate that PSs mixed within an MCT- and HOC-rich matrix lower plasma LDL-C, without significantly changing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, in hyperlipidemic, overweight men, and may therefore decrease the risk of cardiovascular events.",

Five ruminally and duodenally cannulated Holstein cows in late lactation were used in a 3 x 5 incomplete Latin square design. Treatments were 1) CONTROL: basal diet (CON), 2) CONTROL+supplementation of canola oil at 1 kg/d in the feed (FED), and 3) CONTROL+abomasal infusion of canola oil at 1 kg/d (INF). Compared with CON, feed intake, ruminal fermentation characteristics, ruminal and total tract digestibilities of nutrients were not significantly affected by FED treatment but duodenal flows and milk concentrations of fatty acids (FA) such as trans-11 18:1 and cis-9 trans-11 18:2 (conjugated linoleic acid, CLA) were increased. In contrast to the effects of FED, INF reduced feed intake, total VFA production, intestinal flows of nutrients, FA digestibility and yields of milk and milk fat. Both FED and INF significantly reduced the proportions of saturated and medium-chain FA, and increased cis 18:1 in milk. Concentrations of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 in milk were increased nearly 2-fold with INF relative to CON. Dietary or postruminal supplementation of canola oil to late-lactation cows reduced saturated FA and increased unsaturated C18 in milk but nutrient digestion was adversely affected with abomasal infusion of canola oil.",

Medium chain triglycerides are easily hydrolyzed in the intestines and the fatty acids are transported directly to the liver via the portal venous system, in contrast to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), which are incorporated into chylomicrons for transport through the lymphatic system or peripheral circulation. Medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) do not require carnitine to cross the double mitochondrial membrane of the hepatocyte, thus they quickly enter the mitochondria and undergo rapid beta-oxidation, whereas most LCFAs are packaged into triglycerides in the hepatocyte. In this single-blind, randomized, cross-over study, 20 healthy men ingested a single dose of either 71 g of MCT oil or canola oil. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at hours one through five post-ingestion to compare the effect of a single oral dosing of MCT oil versus canola oil on post-ingestion plasma triglyceride levels. Mean triglyceride values after canola oil increased 47 percent above baseline (p <0.001), while mean triglyceride values after MCT oil decreased 15 percent from baseline (p <0.001), which is consistent with several other studies involving short- and longer-term feeding with MCT oil. The effect of long-term usage of MCT oil on triglycerides is yet to be established.",

      "abstract": "High fat diets increase body fat stores. The following experiment was undertaken to determine whether the type of dietary fat could influence fat storage and whether voluntary exercise could prevent diet-induced obesity in mice fed high fat diets. Sixty-nine 6-wk-old female mice were fed one of three diets: low fat (11.5% of energy from fat), beef fat (40.8% of energy from fat) or canola oil (40.8% of energy from fat). In each diet group, 13 mice had free access to activity wheels in their cages (exercising), and the remaining 10 mice were housed in standard mouse cages (nonexercising). Body weight and body composition were measured before and after 8 wk of treatment. The nonexercising mice fed beef fat weighed more and had significantly more body fat (23.2 +/- 2.5 g/100 g body wt) than mice fed the low fat or canola oil diet (13.9 +/- 1.7 and 16.8 +/- 1.9 g/100 g body wt, respectively). Voluntary exercise did not affect lean body mass but did result in significantly lower body fat in all diet groups (beef, 12.6 +/- 0.9; low fat, 7.4 +/- 0.6; canola oil, 9.6 +/- 1.4 g/100 g body wt). The amount of body fat of mice fed the monounsaturated canola oil was significantly less than that of mice fed the beef fat diet, suggesting that the type of fat as well as the amount of fat influences body fat stores. Furthermore, voluntary exercise decreased body fat in all mice and prevented diet-induced obesity in mice fed diets high in fat.",

      "abstract": "A crossover trial was conducted to evaluate the acute human health effects of a dust control technology in a swine confinement facility. Twenty lifetime nonsmoking male subjects, with no evidence of allergy or asthma and no previous swine barn exposure, participated in the study, which included a laboratory session (baseline), 5-h exposure in a swine room sprinkled with canola oil (treatment) and 5-h exposure in a traditional swine room (control). Mean values of inhalable dust concentrations and endotoxin levels in the control room were significantly greater than those observed in the treatment room. Mean shift changes in FEV1 from preexposure to end of exposure were 1.1% (standard error, 0.63%) on baseline day, -1.9% (0.63%) on treatment day, and -9.9% (1.12%) on control day; the differences in the shift changes were statistically significant. Mean value of methacholine concentration that reduced the FEV1 by 20% (PC20) in bronchoprovocation tests on baseline day was significantly different from that on treatment day (p = 0.04) and that on control day (p < 0.001). Significant increases were also observed in white blood cell counts and nasal lavage cell counts on the control day in comparison with the other two days. Blood neutrophil counts after control room exposure were twice those observed on baseline and after exposure to the treatment room. Significant differences were also observed in IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 nasal lavage cytokines and in IL-6 serum cytokine. These results suggest that the canola oil dust control method is effective in improving indoor air quality in swine barns and reducing acute health effects in naive healthy subjects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the metabolic effects of a lipid-lowering diet containing either low erucic rapeseed (canola) oil or olive oil. METHODS: Twenty-two hyperlipidemic patients participated in a cross-over study comprising two consecutive 3.5-week treatment periods. The participants were free-living throughout the study period, visiting the metabolic clinic initially and at the end of each treatment period for weighing and blood sampling. All food was prepared daily and weighed out for each individual appropriate to his/her energy requirement. RESULTS: Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and the ratio between low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased to the same extent on the two diets tested, as did the apolipoproteins B, A-I and Lp(a). After adjustment for body weight changes, most of the reported effects remained virtually unaltered. However, there was a slightly greater decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with the diet containing rapeseed oil (-17%, p < 0.001) than with the olive oil diet (-13%, p < 0.01) with p < 0.04 for the difference between diets. Also, the intravenous glucose tolerance improved to a similar extent on both diets. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that lipid-lowering diets containing either rapeseed oil or olive oil have similar effects on serum lipoprotein concentration and glucose tolerance in hyperlipidemic subjects.",

      "abstract": "Four barrows, average initial weight 35 kg, were fitted with permanent pancreatic re-entrant cannulas and used to determine the effect of level and quality of dietary fat on exocrine pancreatic secretions. The pigs were fed four corn starch-based diets that contained 15% crude protein from isolated soy protein. Diet 1 contained no canola oil (C-0); diet 2, 15% canola oil (C-15); diet 3, 15% canola oil that was heated under vacuum at 180 degrees C for 12 h (C-15/12); diet 4, 15% canola oil that was heated under vacuum at 180 degrees C for 24 h (C-15/24). Heat treatment resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase in the content of malonaldehyde which is derived from the oxidation of fatty acids and which is closely related to odour and rancidity in lipids. The experiment was carried out according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The pigs were fed twice daily, at 08:00 and 20:00 h, 900 g each meal. Following an adaptation period of 7 d, pancreatic juice was collected continuously for 24 h at 2-h intervals from 08:00 on d 8 until 08:00 on d 9 and from 08:00 on d 10 until 08:00 on d 11 during each experimental period. The volume of secretion of pancreatic juice peaked 6-10 h postprandially and was similar (P > .05) during day (08:00-20:00 h) and night (20:00-08:00 h). Replacement of 15% starch by 15% canola oil resulted in a decrease (P < .05) in the secretion of alpha-amylase and an increase (P < .05) in the secretion of lipase. The inclusion of oxidized fat caused a further increase (P < .05) in total lipase activities. It can be concluded that the exocrine pancreas is able to adapt to variations in the level and quality of dietary lipids.",

Compared with baseline a 35% decrease (P less than 0.05) in arachidonic acid was observed in platelet phospholipids of the canola-oil diet group while long chain n-3 fatty acids rose 7-26% (P greater than 0.05). Compared with baseline both unsaturated-fatty-acid diets reduced platelet aggregation at 3 wk of oil-based diet feeding (P less than 0.01) whereas only canola oil influenced platelet function (lowered ATP secretion) at 8 wk (P less than 0.01). No significant difference was observed in thromboxane B2 concentrations between oil-treatment groups at 8 wk. Both oil-based diets had short-term beneficial effects on platelet function but the effect of canola oil persisted longer.",

Four different muscles were excised from each carcass at 24 h post-mortem for analyses. Inclusion of 10% and 20% CO in the animal diet increased (P < 0·05) the relative amount (weight per cent) of unsaturated fatty acids in the total lipids (lipids extracted by 2:1 chloroform-methanol) by 6·7 and 15·8 percentage points, respectively, from 57·8% for the control and also increased (P < 0·05) that of polyunsaturated fatty acids by 5·5 and 9·7 percentage points, respectively, from 19·4% for the control. The 20% CO treatment increased (P < 0·05) the relative amount of monounsaturated fatty acids (primarily C18:1) by 6·1 percentage points from 38·4% for the control, while the 10% CO treatment had no significant effect. The 10% or 20% CO treatment had no significant effect on microsomal enzymic lipid peroxidation activity, heme pigment content, nonheme iron content and total lipid concentration. Overall lipid oxidation in ground muscle samples stored at 4°C tended to be higher for the 10% and 20% CO treatment groups than for the control. The tendency of increased lipid oxidation by the CO treatments apparently resulted from the increased percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids, rather than from changes in catalytic constituents."
