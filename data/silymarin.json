      "abstract": "Given its impact on glucose metabolism, the insulin receptor (IR) is considered one of the key focus areas for medical intervention in people suffering from diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. Silymarin, a natural flavonoid complex obtained from Silybum marianum (milk thistle), has been used and is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms; however, the possible effects of these compounds on the insulin receptor are yet to be fully explored. In this study, molecular docking was carried out to ascertain the binding and interaction of the active components of silymarin, such as silybin, silychristin, and silydianin, with the insulin receptor. The results from the docking simulations showed that silybin, the most important silymarin's active component, possessed relatively higher binding energies and interacted with the important key residues in the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor, suggesting possible effects on receptor activation and downstream signalling pathways that are involved in insulin's action. Moreover, the active sites on the insulin molecule possess equivalent potentials to those of silymarin, suggesting their capacity to attach to the insulin receptor. This molecular basis has led to clinical studies looking for a mechanism for which silymarin functions to alter insulin signaling, which can be targeted for the treatment of patients battling insulin resistance and diabetes. Such interactions and the possible use of such compounds in therapies can be further proved by cytometric and molecular studies depicting the usage of molecular dynamics simulations.",

      "abstract": "It is widely believed that Silybum marianum (Silymarin) alleviates liver injury arising from various etiologies with different degrees of damage through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. This meta-analysis investigated the effects of silymarin administration on serum levels of liver enzymes including AST, ALT and ALP. From inception to November, 2023, a comprehensive literature search was conducted. Inclusion criteria for this study were randomized trials that provided sufficient data for each group at the beginning and end of the follow-up period. Ultimately, 55 studies with a total of 3545 patients were included. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) V4 software was used for meta-analysis. Begg's funnel plot symmetry status, Begg's rank correlation, and Egger's weighted regression tests were used to examine potential publication bias. According to the findings of this meta-analysis silymarin administration showed a significant reduction in AST (SMD [95% CI]: - 0.670 [- 0.931, - 0.408], p-value = 0.000), and ALT (SMD [95% CI]: - 0.912 [- 1.177, - 0.646], p-value = 0.000) levels. While it had no statistically significant effect on ALP level (SMD [95% CI]: - 0.236 [- 1.929, 1.458], p-value = 0.159). Meta-regression analysis showed that there is no significant association between dose, age, BMI, treatment duration and hepatoprotective effects of silymarin. In subgroup analysis, a greater reduction in liver enzymes levels was observed in patients under 50 years old. The subgroup analysis was also showed significant decrease in AST and ALT levels for patients with BMI less than 30, while silymarin treatment had no significant effects on AST and ALT levels in patients with BMI ≥ 30. Silymarin at a dose of less than 400 mg and treatment duration ≤ 2 months showed greater decreasing effects on AST and ALT levels compared to its high doses and longer treatment duration. AST and ALT levels significantly decreased in patients with NAFLD and viral hepatitis, while it had no significant hepatoprotective effects in patients with drugs induced liver injury and alcohol-related liver disease. Modifying the dose and treatment duration with silymarin is recommended in patients with various causes of liver damage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The flavonoid silymarin (SMN) has shown promise due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. SMN has been widely used in preclinical and clinical studies to treat various types of cancer, alone and with chemotherapy agents. Recent research suggests that SMN may increase conventional chemotherapy efficacy and reduce adverse effects. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of SMN and its combination with capecitabine (CAP) and irinotecan (IRI) in a mouse model of colon cancer. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Following 1,2 dimethylhydrazine-induced colon cancer, a modified diet supplemented with SMN (2500 ppm) and mono- and combined therapy of CAP and IRI was used. Serum samples were analyzed for lipid profile, liver function, and inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and inflammation markers, including malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured in colonic, hepatic, and circulatory samples. Colonic BAX and Bcl-2 levels were examined via western blotting and histopathological analysis of colon sections was conducted. FINDINGS/RESULTS: SMN alone and combined with chemotherapeutic agents significantly mitigated the elevated inflammatory cytokines liver function enzyme levels, and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, SMN supplementation with chemotherapy agents enhanced antioxidant activity and reduced lipid peroxidation and inflammatory markers. Significant upregulation of BAX and downregulation of Bcl-2 were observed. In addition, treatment regimens ameliorated carcinogen-induced polyp multiplicity, adenoma formation, dysplastic changes, and lymphocytic aggregation. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results demonstrated that the potential anticancer properties of SMN could enhance chemotherapy efficacy and reduce carcinogen- and chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silymarin is a natural flavonoid component isolated from the Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) plant with multiple pharmacological activities. We investigated its anti-fibrotic effect on the liver and demonstrated its role in activating hepatic progenitor stem cells during liver regeneration. METHODS: Hybrid polymeric protein nanoparticles were prepared by loading silymarin with an albumin-hyaluronic acid complex to achieve stem cell targeting and increase silymarin's bioavailability. RESULTS: TEM, Zeta potential, DLS, UV-visible spectrophotometer, Fluorescence analysis, and FTIR verified the successful formation of nanoparticles and efficient encapsulation. In the present study, The liver fibrotic model was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride, followed by the injection of silymarin NPs into mice twice a week for 4 weeks. We evaluated the expression of hepatic fibrosis markers such as (Collagen I, TGF-β1, SMAD3, and MMP-3) and hepatic progenitor stem cell activation markers such as (HNF1β, FOXl1, CD90, Vimentin, and CD105). The results showed that the targeted silymarin NPs caused significant suppression and downregulation of Collagen I, TGF-β, SMAD-3, and MMP-3 and upregulation of the hepatic progenitor stem cells markers HNF1β, FOXl1, CD90, Vimentin, and CD105. They also didn't induce expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, proving that they cause no signs of inflammation. CONCLUSION: The novel point is that these results demonstrated that the targeted Silymarin NPs not only could efficiently alleviate CCl4-induced liver fibrosis more than using only free silymarin; by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad-3 signaling pathway, but also could activate hepatic progenitor stem cells causing liver regeneration."

      "abstract": "Silymarin, a herbal compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has shown potential in inhibiting colon cancer cell growth. However, its clinical application is hindered by poor bioavailability. This study introduces a novel metal-organic framework, Sul-IRMOF, modified with 6-aminocaproic acid (ACA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) to create Sul-IRMOF-ACA-HA, which enables targeted drug delivery via HA receptors. Histological staining, biochemical analyses, and flow cytometry revealed that Sul-IRMOF-ACA-HA@Sily significantly enhances cytotoxicity against CT-26 cells compared to pure silymarin. According to oxidative stress markers, Sul-IRMOF-ACA-HA@Sily significantly reduced total thiol and glutathione (GSH) content compared to the control (p < 0.001) and silymarin (p < 0.001). Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were significantly reduced in all treatment groups (p < 0.001), with Sul-IRMOF-ACA-HA@Sily showing the most pronounced effects (p < 0.001 vs. silymarin). Additionally, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were significantly elevated in the silymarin and Sul-IRMOF-ACA-HA@Sily groups compared to the control (p < 0.001), with Sul-IRMOF-ACA-HA@Sily further increasing both markers compared to silymarin (p < 0.001). The synergistic design of ACA, HA, and Sul-IRMOF offers a promising strategy to overcome silymarin's bioavailability limitations, positioning Sul-IRMOF-ACA-HA@Sily as a novel therapeutic candidate for colorectal cancer."

      "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic chemical used in producing polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins and is commonly found in everyday items like water bottles and food containers. Although its usefulness cannot be overemphasized, the major challenge is its toxicity, including renal toxicity. BPA has been reported to induce ferroptosis and amyloidosis via the modulation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. On the other hand, silymarin activates the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, thus providing cellular defense. However, the effect of silymarin on BPA-induced renal toxicity is yet to be reported. This study investigated the potential impact of silymarin on renal structure and function following post-weaning BPA exposure. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four equal groups. The control was vehicle-treated, while the silymarin-treated received 100 mg/kg/day of silymarin and BPA-treated rats received 50 mg/kg/day of BPA. The BPA + silymarin-treated rats received treatments as BPA-treated and silymarin-treated. Silymarin diminished BPA-induced rise in serum urea, creatinine, BUN, and plasma kim-1 levels. Also, silymarin improved BPA-induced dyslipidemia. More so, silymarin abrogated toxic amyloid formation and improved renal histoarchitecture in BPA-exposed rats. These events were associated with the suppression of BPA-induced rise in renal iron, MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β, and cytochrome c levels, and myeloperoxidase and caspase 3 activities by silymarin therapy. Furthermore, silymarin attenuated BPA-induced downregulation of Nrf2 and GSH levels, and HO-1, GPX4, SOD, catalase, GST, and GR activities. In conclusion, silymarin mitigated post-weaning BPA-induced renal toxicity by suppressing ferroptosis and amyloidosis through Kim-1/Nrf2/HO-1 modulation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and oxaliplatin and capecitabine (XELOX) are the most widely used chemotherapy regimens for treating metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC). These regimens are associated with various adverse reactions, including neuropathy and hand-foot syndrome (HFS). Silymarin, a flavonoid derived from Silybum marianum, has a wide range of biological activities. It has been used to counteract chemotherapy side effects due to its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the preventive effect of nano-silymarin on neuropathy and HFS induced by the FOLFOX6 and XELOX regimens. METHODS: A randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients who were randomly assigned to receive 70 mg capsules containing 15% silymarin nano micelles twice a day after meals, starting from the first day of the first chemotherapy course and continuing for six courses of the XELOX or m-FOLFOX6 regimen. The severity of adverse effects was assessed after the third and sixth courses based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5. RESULTS: The median CTCAE scores for HFS and neuropathy were significantly lower in the nano-silymarin group at the end of the third course (P < 0.001). However, the difference remained significant only for HFS at the end of the sixth course (P = 0.022). Additionally, the scores increased significantly in both the placebo and nano-silymarin groups during the therapy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nano-silymarin may be considered an adjuvant medication for the prevention of certain chemotherapy-induced adverse reactions. Further research with larger sample sizes and various doses of nano-silymarin is recommended for a more comprehensive evaluation."

In order to control this cancer, new therapeutic strategies are therefore required. Here, we evaluated the effects of doxorubicin and the milk thistle plant phytochemical Silymarin on liver cancer through apoptosis, autophagy, and Wnt signaling. METHODS: Silymarin both alone and together with doxorubicin was administered to induce cytotoxicity in the H22 cell line. qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, the genes related to autophagy, Wnt signals, and cell death were examined. RESULTS: Doxorubicin and Silymarin both individually and combined dramatically slowed down H22 cells growth. Additionally, there was a significant drop in the Bcl-2 protein and a considerable rise in the caspase 8 and Bax proteins. LC3-I, LC3-II, and Beclin 1 have been all shown to be significantly elevated. Moreover, there was a substantial decrease in the expression of genes involved in the Wnt pathway, including cyclin D1, β-catenin, ZEB1, and Twist. The levels of AMPK were decreased in Silymarin with Doxorubicin alone and in combination, whereas VASP, VEGF, and HIF-1a were lowest.

METHODS: 40 rats were used to evaluate the beneficial effect of silymarin and camel milk against aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) toxicity in rats. The classified treatments were the control negative (no treatment) and the control positive (supplied with 1.4 mg aflatoxin/kg diet) for 28 days. Camel milk group (supplied with 1.4 mg aflatoxin/kg diet) for 28 days and camel milk (1 milliliter of camel milk per kilogram of body weight) orally, from day 29 to day 43). Silymarin (supplied with 1.4 mg aflatoxin/kg diet) for 28 days and silymarin (20 mg silymarin/kg b.wt), orally, from day 29 to day 43). The evaluation was done through measuring leukocyte count, liver function tests, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), ferritin, and testosterone. Moreover, the histopathology of the liver and testes was done along with expression levels of specific genes in the liver and testes. RESULTS: The outcomes showed that the post-treatment with silymarin and camel milk improved biochemical markers in serum and ability to reproduce. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, post-treatment with camel milk and silymarin could mitigate the negative effect of AFB1 on rats."

Silymarin, a polyphenolic flavonoid, has been proven to have anti-parasitic activities and various medical uses. The current study aimed to evaluate silymarin efficacy against intestinal and muscular phases of murine trichinellosis compared to the standard drug; albendazole. Forty-eight mice were divided into four discrete groups: healthy model; diseased model; silymarin treatment; and albendazole treatment. The assessment of therapy efficacy was conducted parasitologically through counting the adult worms and muscle larvae, histopathologically through examination of the intestinal and muscular tissues, and, immunohistochemically through muscular expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor. Both silymarin and albendazole-treated groups demonstrated a statistically significant decrease (P < 0.001) in the mean count of adult Trichinella and the encysted larvae when compared to the diseased model, with an improvement of intestinal and muscular inflammation, and degeneration of the encysted larvae in muscles. Also, vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in both silymarin, and albendazole-treated groups compared to the diseased model. Silymarin recorded antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenic effects on experimental trichinellosis."

      "abstract": "Medicinal plants and their phytochemicals have been extensively employed worldwide for centuries to address a diverse range of ailments, boasting a history that spans several decades. These plants are considered the source of numerous medicinal compounds. For instance, silymarin is a polyphenolic flavonoid extract obtained from the milk thistle plant or Silybum marianum which has been shown to have significant neuroprotective effects and great therapeutic benefits. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a class of neurological diseases that have become more prevalent in recent years, and although treatment is available, there is no complete cure developed yet. Silymarin utilizes a range of molecular mechanisms, including modulation of MAPK, AMPK, NF-κB, mTOR, and PI3K/Akt pathways, along with various receptors, enzymes, and growth factors. These mechanisms collectively contribute to its protective effects against NDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Despite its safety and efficacy, silymarin faces challenges related to bioavailability and aqueous solubility, hindering its development as a clinical drug. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying silymarin's neuroprotective effects, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for NDs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to ionizing radiation is inevitable due to its extensive use in industrial and medical applications. The search for effective and safe natural therapeutic agents as alternatives to chemical drugs is crucial to mitigate their side effects. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of citicoline as a standalone treatment or in combination with the anti-hepatotoxic drug silymarin in protecting against liver injury caused by γ-radiation in rats. METHODS AND RESULTS: The rats were exposed to γ-radiation (7 Gy) and treated with citicoline (300 mg/kg/day) and/or silymarin (50 mg/kg/day). The results showed that citicoline alleviated liver damage in irradiated rats by reducing hepatic malondialdehyde levels, serum aspartate aminotransferase activity, and inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). It also increased acetylcholine (ACh) levels and the gene expression of the anti-inflammatory protein α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR). Additionally, citicoline improved serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels, thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRβ) gene expression, and iodothyronine deiodinase type 1 activity in hepatic tissues of irradiated rats. Furthermore, citicoline enhanced the effects of silymarin on thyroxine (T4), TRβ, ACh, and α7nAChR when co-administered in irradiated rats. Histopathological analysis confirmed these findings, demonstrating improved liver tissue structure. CONCLUSIONS: Citicoline mitigates γ-radiation-induced liver damage by reducing oxidative stress, activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, and modulating thyroid hormone metabolism. These findings support the use of citicoline as a safe standalone treatment or as an adjuvant with silymarin for managing liver damage and thyroid hormone disturbances caused by γ-irradiation.",

Fenofibrate is an effective hypolipidemic drug, but its benefits for ameliorating disorders associated with hypertriglyceridemia failed to be proven in clinical trials. Methods: To search for possible causes of this situation and possibilities of their favorable influence, we tested the effect of FF monotherapy and the combination of fenofibrate with silymarin on metabolic disorders in a unique model of hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats (HHTg). Results: Fenofibrate treatment (100 mg/kg BW/day for four weeks) significantly decreased serum levels of triglyceride, (-77%) and free fatty acids (-29%), the hepatic accumulation of triglycerides, and the expression of genes encoding transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism (Srebf2, Nr1h4. Rxrα, and Slco1a1). In contrast, the hypertriglyceridemia-induced ectopic storage of lipids in muscles, the heart, and kidneys reduced glucose utilization in muscles and was not affected. In addition, fenofibrate reduced the activity of the antioxidant system, including Nrf2 expression (-35%) and increased lipoperoxidation in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys and heart. Adding silymarin (micronized form, 600 mg/kg BW/day) to fenofibrate therapy increased the synthesis of glycogen in muscles, (+36%) and reduced hyperinsulinemia (-34%). In the liver, it increased the activity of the antioxidant system, including PON-1 activity and Nrf2 expression, and reduced the formation of lipoperoxides. The beneficial effect of combination therapy on the parameters of oxidative stress and lipoperoxidation was also observed, to a lesser extent, in the heart and kidneys. Conclusions: Our results suggest the potential beneficial use of the combination of FF with SLM in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia-induced metabolic disorders."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effect of silymarin on insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to September 2024 for relevant RCTs. The intervention required silymarin supplementation for at least 4 weeks. Primary outcomes were homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fasting insulin (FI), while secondary outcomes included quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Bias risk was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2. Subgroup analyses were based on disease type, duration, and dosage. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were conducted using Egger's and Begg's tests. Statistical analysis and meta-analysis were performed using Stata 15.1. RESULTS: Six studies with 673 participants from Iran, Egypt, and Italy were included. All studies had low risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that Silybum marianum significantly improved HOMA-IR (WMD = -2.29, 95 % CI: -4.55 to -0.03, p = 0.047) but had no effect on FI (WMD = -2.56, 95 % CI: -7.60 to 2.48, p = 0.862). Subgroup analyses revealed improvements in HOMA-IR for T2DM and diabetics with alcoholic cirrhosis, but no effect in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. QUICKI did not show significant changes in any group. Only one study reported changes in QUICKI. The results indicated that, compared to the placebo, silymarin improved insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of silymarin in improving HOMA-IR and FI levels in metabolic diseases, and it generally does not appear to significantly improve these parameters. Future studies should aim to increase the number of high-quality RCTs to further validate the efficacy and safety of silymarin, as well as to explore its underlying mechanisms.",

Silymarin, a flavonoid complex derived from milk thistle, has shown promise in liver disease treatment due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. This study aims to explore the therapeutic potential of silymarin in HCC through a comprehensive in silico approach. METHODS: This study employed a network pharmacology approach to identify key molecular targets of silymarin in HCC. The Genecards and Metascape databases were used for target identification and functional annotation. Molecular docking analysis was conducted on the primary silymarin components against VEGFA and SRC proteins, which are critical in HCC progression. MD simulations followed to assess the stability and interactions of the docked complexes. RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis identified several key molecular targets and pathways implicated in HCC. The molecular docking results revealed strong binding affinities of silymarin components to VEGFA and SRC, with Silybin A and Isosilybin B showing the highest affinities. MD simulations confirmed the stability of these interactions, indicating potential inhibitory effects on HCC progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive in silico evaluation of silymarin's therapeutic potential in HCC. The findings suggest that silymarin, particularly its components Silybin A and Isosilybin B, may effectively target VEGFA and SRC proteins, offering a promising avenue for HCC treatment. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm these findings and facilitate the development of silymarin-based therapeutics for HCC."

      "abstract": "AIM AND BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of silymarin in improving liver function and reducing liver stiffness in chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. Silymarin, a hepatoprotective agent, has shown potential benefits in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis, but evidence in CLD with varied etiologies remains limited. This study addresses the gap by assessing its impact across diverse etiological subgroups. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A non-randomized clinical trial was conducted at Lahore General Hospital, Lahore, over 18 months. Out of 148 enrolled chronic liver disease (CLD) patients, 141 completed the 12-week follow-up. Patients were stratified into two groups: silymarin (200 mg twice daily) plus standard care and standard care alone. Baseline and follow-up data, including clinical, biochemical, and FibroScan (EchoSens, Ivry-sur-Seine, France) was collected and stratified analysis based on etiology was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). RESULTS: This study evaluated 141 chronic liver disease (CLD) patients who completed the three-month follow-up, 68 in the standard treatment group and 73 in the silymarin group. Baseline characteristics were comparable except for age and body mass index (BMI). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels significantly reduced in the silymarin group (63.04 ± 22.38 U/L) compared to the standard group (78.49 ± 22.93 U/L, p=0.000), with higher ALT normalization in the silymarin group (35.6% vs. 22.1%, p=0.076). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were also significantly lower in the silymarin group (57.08 ± 20.94 U/L vs. 65.90 ± 24.18 U/L, p=0.022). Improvements in hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class were similar across groups (p > 0.05). The stratified analysis highlighted greater ALT and AST reductions for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the silymarin group. FibroScan (EchoSens, France) scores, bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), and prothrombin time (PT) showed no significant differences between groups. These findings suggest silymarin's potential in improving liver enzymes, particularly in metabolic etiologies. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that silymarin effectively reduces ALT and AST levels and achieves higher ALT normalization compared to standard treatment in CLD patients. While improvements in hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and CTP class were comparable between groups, silymarin showed greater efficacy in metabolic conditions like NAFLD."

This study examined whether combining Silymarin (SIL) with Vitamin C (Vit C) enhances protection against lithium-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, comparing their individual antioxidant effects as well. Rats subjected to Li exposure were provided with a standard commercial diet supplemented with 80 mmol LiCl per kilogram for 28 days. Concurrently, SIL and Vit C were administered orally at dosages of 200 and 100 mg/kg body weight, respectively, throughout the 28 days. The study assessed levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), to evaluate the protective effects of SIL and Vit C against oxidative stress. Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) levels in kidney tissues were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Serum and urine parameters (sodium, potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and urea) and serum lithium levels were also measured. Lithium-induced nephrotoxicity showed increased renal toxicity markers and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity. SIL administration significantly reduced markers of kidney tissue toxicity, increased antioxidant enzyme activities, regulated the aforementioned physiological parameters in blood and urine, and downregulated AQP2 expression in the kidney. However, Vit C administration did not demonstrate a significant protective effect against lithium-induced renal toxicity. These findings indicate that SIL effectively protects against lithium-induced nephrotoxicity, whereas Vitamin C does not exhibit this protective effect."

Silymarin, as a flavonoid complex derived from the milk thistle plant, has recently shown potential health benefits, particularly concerning reproductive health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of GO and silymarin supplementation, both individually and in combination, on the characteristics of frozen-thawed ram sperm. Semen samples were collected using standard artificial insemination (AI) techniques with an artificial vagina. The collected semen was evaluated and cryopreserved in a tris-based extender containing varying concentrations of silymarin and GO (0, 10, or 20 μg/mL) or their combination. Post-thaw assessments evaluated sperm motility, viability, morphological abnormalities, DNA integrity, membrane integrity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Our findings revealed that the combination of 20 μg/mL silymarin and 20 μg/mL GO significantly enhanced total motility, viability, membrane integrity, and DNA integrity of sperm. Additionally, this treatment effectively reduced morphological abnormalities and MDA levels post-thawing. Notably, SOD and TAC activities were improved following the freeze-thaw compared to other treatment groups. In conclusion, the combination of silymarin and GO significantly improves the quality of frozen-thawed ram sperm by enhancing sperm parameters while reducing oxidative stress markers. The results suggest their potential as effective additives in cryopreservation protocols, providing a promising avenue for improving reproductive outcomes in rams and potentially other livestock species.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy is a highly recommended treatment for different types of solid tumors. However, this treatment can have severe side effects on the heart and lungs. In this study, we compared the protective effects of citral, silymarin, thymoquinone, and curcumin against 5-fluorouracil-induced toxicity in the heart and lungs of rats. METHODS: 56 healthy adult male rats were randomly assigned to seven experimental groups (n = 8), including healthy and carrier (dimethylsulfoxide) groups, 5-fluorouracil, citral group, silymarin group, thymoquinone group, and curcumin group. Blood samples and representative tissue specimens of the heart and lungs were immediately collected at the end of the experiment to measure the biochemical parameters, conduct histopathological studies, and analyze antioxidant activity, respectively. RESULTS: The intraperitoneal administration of 5-fluorouracil caused cardiotoxicity, as evidenced by elevated serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, creatine kinase-MB (p < 0.05), and lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.05). Besides, 5-fluorouracil increased malondealdehyde levels, indicating a lipid peroxidation index and a decrease in the total antioxidant capacity index in the cardiac and pulmonary tissues (p < 0.05) of the animals. The preventive and therapeutic use of all the above compounds, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, led to a decrease in the mentioned cardiac serum biomarkers and malondealdehyde in the animals (p < 0.05). In addition, all the therapeutic compounds increased total antioxidant capacity in the heart and lungs (p < 0.05), indicating a high antioxidant capacity of these biological substances in ameliorating the resultant oxidative and histologic damages. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that the natural compounds citral, silymarin, thymoquinone, and curcumin, when combined with 5-fluorouracil, could minimize the histopathological and biochemical changes caused by 5-fluorouracil treatment in the heart and pulmonary tissues likely via antioxidant mechanisms. These products can be useful and effective in chemotherapy patients by reducing the potential adverse effects of 5-fluorouracil administration."

      "abstract": "Male fertility is adversely influenced by diabetes. The beneficial effects of antioxidant bioflavonoids in improving fertility have been reported. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of silymarin on diabetes mellitus-induced male reproductive impairment in rats by investigating its role in Hsp70 and Hsp90 expression. To conduct this study, 18 mature male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (Con), experimental diabetes type 1 (T1D-sole)-induced, and silymarin (SMN, 120 mg/kg, orally)-treated T1D-induced groups. The testicular total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were evaluated. Tubular differentiation index (TDI), repopulation index (RI), spermiogenesis index (SPI), and the Johnson score were also investigated. The DNA Ladder test was used to evaluate testicular DNA fragmentation, and RNA damage was assessed through fluorescent staining. Immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses were performed for Hsp70 and Hsp90. Oral administration of SMN significantly (p<0.05) increased the TAC ratio and decreased the MDA content in testicles compared to the T1D-sole group. The results showed that T1D increased the percentage of seminiferous tubules with negative TDI, RI, and SPI and reduced the Johnson score compared to the Con group (p<0.05). However, treatment with SMN ameliorated the T1D-induced damages to TDI, RI, SPI, and the Johnson score (p<0.05) compared to the T1D group (p<0.05). The staining intensities and the number of Hsp70+ and Hsp90+ cells were significantly higher in the Con group compared to the T1D-sole animals (p<0.05). However, rats treated with SMN showed an increased number of Hsp70+ and Hsp90+ cells per mm² of tissue compared to the T1D-sole group (p<0.05). Diabetes caused DNA fragmentation and RNA damage, but silymarin reduced its negative effects. In conclusion, SMN ameliorates T1D-suppressed spermatogenesis by upregulating testicular antioxidant status and Hsp70 and Hsp90 expression in testicular tissue. Consequently, it can be considered a potential complementary medication for male patients with T1D.",

Primary outcomes included improvement in hepatic steatosis and ALT activity, while secondary outcomes included changes in AST activity, blood lipids, glucose, BMI, blood pressure, and TNF-α. Twenty-seven studies involving 1691 participants were included. Curcumin significantly improved hepatic steatosis compared to placebo (OR: 4.39, 95% CI: 1.45 to 13.27, p = 0.009), followed by resveratrol (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.20 to 8.42, p = 0.02). Silymarin exhibited the strongest effect in reducing ALT levels (MD: -6.44 U/L, 95% CI: -10.03 to -2.85, p = 0.0004), with curcumin (MD: -5.88 U/L, 95% CI: -9.05 to -2.72, p = 0.0003) also showing significant reductions. A marked reduction in AST was observed with silymarin (MD: -6.99 U/L, 95% CI: -8.56 to -5.42, p < 0.00001), followed by curcumin (MD: -3.36 U/L, 95% CI: -5.35 to -1.36, p = 0.001). Furthermore, curcumin intake significantly improved metabolic indicators (TG, FBG, HOMA-IR, and BMI). Resveratrol reduced FBG and DBP. Curcumin had the strongest effect on hepatic steatosis and improved both transaminase levels and metabolic markers. Silymarin demonstrated the greatest reduction in transaminase levels, while resveratrol showed modest benefits in steatosis and metabolic improvements. The three polyphenols appear as promising therapeutics for the treatment of MASLD."

      "abstract": "Most cancer patients suffer cognitive impairment following chemotherapy, recognized as \"chemobrain\". Principally, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are frequently utilized conjointly for the treatment of several kinds of tumors. Silymarin was reported to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective impacts. The recent study shed light on the neuroprotective attributes of silymarin against cognitive dysfunction instigated in rats with doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide combination. Unfortunately, silymarin suffers reduced absorption following oral administration. Silymarin was formulated as a nanoemulsion to be administered intranasally. Male rats were allocated into six groups: control, doxorubicin (2 mg/kg, ip) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg, ip), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide + silymarin (200 mg/kg, oral), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide + silymarin nanoemulsion (1 mg/kg, intranasal), silymarin (200 mg/kg, oral), and silymarin nanoemulsion (1 mg/kg, intranasal) groups, and treated for 21 days. The amount of silymarin reaching the brain was found to be enhanced following formulated nanoemulsion administration. Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide caused behavioral, as well as memory deficits indicated by locomotor activity, y maze, and passive avoidance tests. Also, they induced histological alteration in hippocampi and the prefrontal cortices of rats. Besides, chemotherapy caused cognitive impairment assessed by acetylcholinesterase activity elevation. Additionally, caspase-3 augmentation and of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway disturbance were found following chemotherapy treatment. Silymarin treatment opposed such effects via enhancing memory function, preserving brain architecture, and reducing acetylcholinesterase activity and caspase-3 level. Moreover, silymarin treatment improved mitochondrial biogenesis through activation Nrf-2/HO-1 axis. Collectively, silymarin nanoemulsion, at a 200-fold lower dose, can offer an innovative solution for cancer patients globally.",

Inflammation/apoptosis/ROS pathways appear to be activated in the liver and kidney toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. This study was conducted to investigate the potential effects of silymarin (SLY) use against docetaxel (DTX)-induced liver and kidney damage in rats. For this purpose, 30 mg/kg DTX was administered intraperitoneally to Sprague Dawley rats on the first day of the study, followed by SLY (25 or 50 mg/kg/day) orally for 7 days. Then, various analyses were performed on liver and kidney tissues using biochemical, molecular and histological methods. The data obtained showed that DTX administration suppressed antioxidant markers and increased lipid peroxidation in liver and kidney tissues. It was also determined that DTX administration triggered markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy. On the other hand, SLY treatment increased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels and decreased malondialdehyde levels. Additionally, SLY alleviated DTX-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy in liver and kidney tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that DTX increased the density of 8-OHdG positive cells in liver and kidney tissues, while oxidative DNA damage decreased after SLY administration. ALT, AST, ALP, Urea and Creatinine levels increased in the DTX group and decreased in the SLY treatment groups. In conclusion, DTX administration caused toxicity in liver and kidney tissues and damaged tissue integrity, while SLY treatment alleviated DTX-induced toxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with a systemic inflammatory state that contributes to neuroinflammation and increases the risk of stroke at an early age. Stroke is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of permanent disability. This work aimed to assess whether obesity-induced neuroinflammation can be a prognostic stroke factor that can be improved with oral administration of silymarin, an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective drug. METHODS: Male C57/Bl6 mice were used to establish an obesity model through a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Cerebral ischemia was performed with photothrombosis in the left motor cortex at the end of the diet. Following the induction of ischemia, silymarin (100 mg/kg) was administered orally for 14 days. Levels of pro-inflammatory (IL1β, TNFα, and MCP1) and anti-inflammatory markers (IL4, IL10), neurotrophic factors (IGF1, BDNF), and CX3CL1 were assessed in the cortex and striatum using ELISA. RESULTS: Mice on the HFD gained significantly more weight than control subjects and exhibited altered glucose metabolism, which was improved after silymarin treatment. The survival rate was significantly lower in HFD mice (52.2%) compared to control mice (86%). Silymarin treatment improved survival in both ischemic groups (non-diet control: 95.7%, HFD: 78.3%). Silymarin raised cortical TNFα, IL4, IL10, IGF1, BDNF, and CX3CL1 levels in the HFD group with stroke, while the striatum did not present relevant differences. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that silymarin improves glucose metabolism, possibly impacting post-stroke survival in obese mice. The increased levels of neurotrophic factors BDNF and IGF1, along with microglial regulatory factor CX3CL1, may contribute to the improved survival observed. These results indicate that silymarin could be a potential therapeutic option for managing neuroinflammation and enhancing post-stroke outcomes in obese individuals."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the past two decades, the global incidence of gout has markedly increased, affecting people worldwide. Considering the side effects of xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor drugs (e.g. allopurinol and febuxostat) used in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout, the potential application of phytochemicals has been widely studied. In addition, XO also takes part in the elimination of certain drugs, including 6-mercaptopurine. In the current explorative study, we aimed to examine the potential effects of tea catechins, resveratrol, silymarin flavonolignans and some of their conjugated metabolites on XO-catalyzed xanthine and 6-mercaptopurine oxidation, applying in vitro assays and modeling studies. RESULTS: Catechins, resveratrol and resveratrol conjugates exerted no or only weak inhibitory effects on XO. Silybin A, silybin B and isosilybin A were weak, silychristin was a moderate, while 2,3-dehydrosilychristin was a potent inhibitor of the enzyme. Sulfate metabolites of silybin A, silybin B and isosilybin A were considerably stronger inhibitors compared to the parent flavonolignans, and the sulfation of 2,3-dehydrosilychristin slightly increased its inhibitory potency. Silychristin was the sole flavonolignan tested, where sulfate conjugation decreased its inhibitory effect. CONCLUSION: 2,3-Dehydrosilychristin seems to be a promising candidate for examining its in vivo antihyperuricemic effects, because both the parent compound and its sulfate conjugate are highly potent inhibitors of XO. © 2024 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our aim is to explore silymarin's protective effects against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) modulation and elucidate potential enriched pathways through in silico analysis of silymarin-associated PERK protein interactors in cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 rats were categorized into three groups: sham, IR and IR + silymarin groups. Cerebral IR damage was not induced. Only the MCA was identified and clamped without further intervention. Sham group received only physiological serum intravenously. IR group, rats were exposed to 2 hours ischaemia and following 3 hours reperfusion. In IR + silymarin group received 1 μg/kg silymarin intravenously (i.v.) before inducing cerebral IR. Cerebral tissues were processed for histological tissue preparation. Hematoxylin-Eosin and PERK immunostaining was applied. In Cytoscape software, we imported and integrated the silymarin and PERK protein-protein interaction networks generated from the STITCH and STRING databases, respectively. Subsequently, Reactome pathway annotation was performed for this intersected network. RESULTS: In the sham group, neurons were large and round with oval nuclei, and no histopathological changes were observed. In the IR group, neurons and neuroglial cells showed degeneration with pyknotic nuclei, apoptotic bodies, dilated and congested cerebral capillaries, and numerous vacuoles. After silymarin treatment, the IR + silymarin group showed a restoration of normal histology, with more regular neural and neuroglial cells and decreased vessel dilation and congestion. PERK immunoexpression was mainly negative in the sham group, increased in the IR group, and decreased again in the IR + silymarin group. Upon intersecting the interactors of silymarin and PERK, 17 common proteins were identified. Reactome pathway analysis revealed potential impacts of these proteins on key pathways including immune and cytokine signaling, apoptosis, estrogen signaling, and extracellular matrix degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Silymarin's targeting of PERK offers a promising approach to alleviate ER stress and potentially modulate multiple critical pathways in cerebral ischaemia reperfusion, serving as a comprehensive therapeutic strategy for managing cerebral IR injury."

We compared the effect of silymarin and thymoquinone in an I/R rat model. Wistar rats were divided into five groups: SHAM, REP (I/R), SIR (200 mg/kg silymarin+I/R), TIR (3 mg/kg thymoquinone+I/R), and STIR (200 mg/kg silymarin+3-mg thymoquinone+I/R). The rats underwent bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 30 min and neurological assessments 24 h thereafter. Apoptosis was evaluated using anti-caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Astrocyte activation was determined using an anti-GFAP antibody. Total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels were measured. SHAM and REP rats had the lowest and highest neurological scores, respectively (p = 0.001). REP rats showed greater deterioration than SIR, TIR, and STIR rats. SIR, TIR, and STIR rats had fewer TUNEL and caspase-3-positive cells than REP rats (p<0.05). GFAP expression was higher in REP rats (p<0.05) than in SIR, TIR, and STIR rats (p<0.05). SIR and TIR rats showed higher TAS than REP rats (p<0.05). SIR, TIR, and STIR rats had lower TMAO values than REP and SHAM rats (p<0.05). Silymarin/thymoquinone reduces impairment, apoptosis, and astrocyte activation. Combination therapy reduces TMAO levels.",

This research investigates the potential of silymarin-supplemented cookies in managing NAFLD by evaluating their impact on liver enzyme activity, inflammatory markers, and lipid profiles. A clinical trial in Lahore, Pakistan, involved 64 NAFLD patients. Participants were divided into placebo and three treatment groups, with the latter receiving silymarin-supplemented cookies for 3 months. The study assessed liver enzyme levels and inflammatory markers, at baseline and after the intervention, utilizing statistical analyses to evaluate differences. The lipid profile and renal function test (RFT) were also measured at baseline and after 3 months in each group for safety assessment. After 3 months, the treatment groups indicated more significant decreases in liver enzymes compared to the placebo group (p ≤ .05). Treatment 3 showed significant reductions in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (64.39-49.38 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (61.53-45.38 U/L). Treatment 3 also showed improvements in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and the AST/ALT ratio. Additionally, the treatment group demonstrated a significant reduction in inflammatory markers. Treatment 3 showed a significant decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) (6.32-3.39 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (38.72-23.86 mm/h), indicating that individuals with NAFLD may benefit from the intervention's potential benefits in lowering inflammation. The study revealed that an intervention significantly improved the inflammatory markers, liver enzymes, and lipid profiles of NAFLD participants, suggesting potential benefits for liver health."

The following is the random grouping of sixty male rats into six groups of ten animals each: the control (negative control), TA-intoxicated group (positive control; 300 mg/kg body weight (BW)), Sl + TA group (100 mg Sl/kg BW + TA), St + TA group (400 mg St/kg BW + TA), Cg + TA (400 mg Cg/kg BW + TA), and St + Cg + TA group (400 St + 400 Cg mg/kg BW + TA) were all administered for 30 days. At the start of the study, groups 2 through 6 were administered TA intraperitoneally at a dosage of 300 mg/kg BW for two consecutive days, with a 24 h gap between each dose, to induce cardiac damage. Blood samples were obtained to measure hematological parameters and perform biochemical assays, including lipid profiles and cardiac enzymes. For histopathology and immunohistochemistry determination, tissue samples were acquired. The current findings showed that TA injection caused hematological alterations and cardiac injury, as evidenced by greater serum levels of troponin I, creatine kinase-MB, and total creatine kinase (p < 0.05), as well as significantly elevated serum malondialdehyde and decreased serum total antioxidant capacity (p < 0.05) concentrations. Moreover, an increase in blood low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol concentration (p < 0.05) was recorded in the TA group. There were alterations in the heart tissue's histological structure of the TA group compared to the control ones. These alterations were characterized by vacuolar degeneration of myocytes, loss of cross striation, coagulative necrosis, and fibrosis of interstitial tissue, which was ameliorated by the supplementation of SI, St, and Cg. The TA-intoxicated group showed weak expression of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (p < 0.05) and strong immunoreactivity of tumor necrosis factor-α and B-cell lymphoma protein 2-associated X (p < 0.05). However, the groups receiving Sl, St, and Cg experienced the opposite. The administration of Sl, St, Cg, and St + Cg along with TA significantly improved and restored (p < 0.05) erythrogram indices, including RBCs, hemoglobin, total leukocytic count, lymphocytes, and monocyte, to the normal control values. The administration of Sl, St, and Cg alleviated the cardiotoxicity caused by TA via reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and apoptosis in heart tissue. In summary, the current findings suggest that the treatment with Sl, St, and Cg was beneficial in ameliorating and reducing the cardiotoxicity induced by TA in rats."

      "abstract": "Aluminum (Al) is abundant in the environment, and its toxicity is attributed to free radical formation and subsequent oxidative stress. While silymarin is a well-known antioxidant, its low water solubility and bioavailability limit its therapeutic effects. This study was designated to formulate silymarin chitosan nanoparticles (SM-CS-NPs) and evaluate its ameliorative effect against hepatotoxicity induced by aluminum chloride (AlCl3). SM-CS-NPs were prepared by ionotropic gelation method and characterized using different techniques. Rats were distributed into six groups (n=7/group), control, silymarin (SM; 15 mg/kg B.W), silymarin-chitosan nanoparticles (SM-CS-NPs; 15 mg/kg), aluminum chloride (AlCl3, 34 mg/kg), SM or SM-CS-NPs administrated orally one hour before the treatment with AlCl3 for 30 days, respectively. Results showed that supplementation of SM-CS-NPs or SM solo improved the antioxidant state and reduced oxidative stress. On the other hand, the pretreatment with SM-CS-NPs or SM followed by AlCl3 significantly restored liver functions (AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, total protein, albumin, globulin, and bilirubin) and modulated oxidative stress biomarkers (TBARS and H2O2), with improved cellular antioxidant defense (SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, GST, and GSH) and maintained normal liver histological structure compared to rats treated with AlCl3 alone. Furthermore, they alleviated the inflammation and apoptosis by downregulating the expression level of COX-2, caspase-3, and TNFα. This ameliorative effect was stronger with silymarin nanoform than in bulk-state silymarin. According to the findings, silymarin preparation in nanoform boosts its ameliorative and protective effects against AlCl3 hepatotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer metastasis remains a significant challenge in cancer therapy, necessitating the exploration of novel treatment modalities. Silymarin, a natural compound derived from milk thistle, has demonstrated promising anticancer properties. This work explored the inhibitory effects of silymarin on lung cancer metastasis and revealed the underlying processes, focusing on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP-9 activities. Using a combination of in vitro and molecular docking analyses, we found that silymarin effectively reducing the lung cancer cells' motility and invasion by modulation of expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Furthermore, MTT assays revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation upon silymarin treatment and found the IC50 value at 58 μM. We observe that apoptotic morphology characteristic in silymarin treated groups. Cell cycle analysis exhibit the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, 25.8 % increased apoptosis in silymarin treated groups, as evidenced by Annexin V staining. Moreover, silymarin treatment shows the lipid peroxidation in elevated level and reduced in enzymatic antioxidant level, indicating its potential role in mitigating oxidative stress induce cell death. Gelatin zymography assay indicates the silymarin has ability to inhibit the MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in lung cancer. Additionally, cell migration assays and colony formation assays demonstrated impaired migratory and colony-forming abilities of lung cancer cells when treated with silymarin. Molecular docking studies further supported the binding affinity of silymarin with MMP-2 and MMP-9, demonstrate the -10.26 and -6.69 kcal/mol of binding energy. Collectively, our findings highlight the multifaceted anticancer properties of silymarin against lung cancer metastasis, providing insights into its therapeutic potential as an adjuvant treatment strategy."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX), an immunosuppressant and anti-cancer medication, can harm the heart. The goal of the current investigation was to assess the cardiotoxicity caused by MTX and the potential cardioprotective properties of silymarin, citral, and thymoquinone as antioxidants. METHODS: Forty-eight rats were divided into six groups, which included control, MTX, cosolvent, citral, thymoquinone, and silymarin groups. At the end of the study, the rats were anesthetized (ketamine and xylazine) and killed using CO2. Their blood samples were collected to measure the enzymatic activities of creatine kinase-myoglobin binding (CK-MB), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Also, the heart tissue was sampled to determine the antioxidant capacity and examine the histopathology. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the activity of CPK, CK-MB, and LDH enzymes significantly reduced in the thymoquinone treatment group compared to the MTX group (p < 0.05). On the other hand, total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased in the thymoquinone group compared to the MTX group (p < 0.05). The pathological modifications (i.e. severe congestion, edema fluid, the presence of inflammatory cells around the blood vessels, mild to moderate hemorrhaging between cardiac muscle fibers) were seen in the MTX group. The treatment groups, particularly thymoquinone, did not experience any appreciable pathological changes. CONCLUSION: The thymoquinone was found to have the strongest protective effect against the heart damage caused by MTX."

      "abstract": "Silymarin, an antioxidant, is locally used for kidney and heart ailments. However, its limited water solubility and less oral bioavailability limit its therapeutic efficiency. The present study investigated the enhancement of solubility and bioavailability of silymarin by loading it in Cordia myxa plant extract-coated zeolitic imidazole framework (CME@ZIF-8) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced nephrotoxicity and cardiac toxicity in albino rats. The synthesized PEG-coated silymarin drug-loaded CME@ZIF-8 MOFs (PEG-Sily@CME@ZIF-8) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and zeta potential. The average crystal size of CME@ZIF-8 and PEG-Sily@CME@ZIF-8 was 12.69 and 16.81 nm, respectively. The silymarin drug loading percentage in PEG-Sily@CME@ZIF-8 was 33.05% (w/w). In the animal model with CCl4 treatment, different parameters like serum profile, enzymatic level, genotoxicity, and histopathology were assessed. Treatment with PEG-Sily@CME@ZIF-8 with different doses of 500, 1000, and 1500 μg/kg body weight efficiently ameliorated the alterations in the antioxidant defenses, biochemical parameters, and histopathological alterations and DNA damage in comparison to silymarin drug in a CCl4-induced toxicity rat model via alleviating the cellular abnormalities and attenuation of normal antioxidant enzymes levels. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of drug-silymarin interaction with the target protein was investigated. It involves the binding pockets of silymarin molecules with VEGFR, TNF-α, NLRP3, AT1R, NOX1, RIPK1, Caspase-3, CHOP, and MMP-9 proteins, elucidating the silymarin-protein interactions by the formation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. This study suggests that the nanodrug PEG-Sily@CME@ZIF-8 MOFs protect the kidneys and heart possibly by mitigating oxidative stress more efficiently than the conventional drug silymarin.",

While current polyphenols for treating IBD can be expensive and cause unwanted side effects, there is an opportunity regarding a new drug/polymer formulation using silymarin and an electrospray procedure. Silymarin is a naturally occurring polyphenolic flavonoid antioxidant that has shown promising results as a pharmacological agent due to its antioxidant and hepatoprotective characteristics. This study aims to produce a drug-polymer complex named the SILS100-Electrofiber complex, using an electrospray system. The vertical set-up of the electrospray system was optimized at a 1:10 of silymarin and Eudragit® S100 polymer to enhance surface area and microfiber encapsulation. The SILS100-Electrofiber complex was evaluated using drug release kinetics via UV Spectrophotometry, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Drug loading, apparent solubility, and antioxidant activity were also evaluated. The study was successful in creating fiber-like encapsulation of the silymarin drug with strand diameters ranging from 5-7 μm, with results showing greater silymarin release in Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF) compared to Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF). Moving forward, this study aims to provide future insight into the formulation of drug-polymer complexes for IBD treatment and targeted drug release using electrospray and microencapsulation."

METHODS: The experiment was conducted using 70 Lohmann LSL-Lite hens at 80 weeks of age with 7 treatments each with 10 replicates. Treatments included: (1) control diet without silymarin, (2) daily intake of 100 mg silymarin powder/kg body weight (BW) (PSM100), (3) daily intake of 200 mg silymarin powder/kg BW (PSM200), (4) daily intake of 100 mg nano-silymarin/kg BW (NSM100), (5) daily intake of 200 mg nano-silymarin/kg BW (NSM200), (6) daily intake of 100 mg lecithinized silymarin/kg BW (LSM100) and (7) daily intake of 200 mg lecithinized silymarin/kg BW (LSM200). The birds were housed individually, and diets were fed for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy showed that NSM was produced with the average particle size of 20.30 nm. Silymarin treatment improved serum antioxidant enzyme activity. All groups receiving silymarin showed a decrease in liver malondialdehyde content, expression of fatty acid synthase, tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6) genes in the liver, and hepatic steatosis than the control, except those fed the PSM100 diet. There were decreases in liver dry matter and fat contents, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocyte ballooning, and an increase in glutathione peroxidase gene expression and a decrease in iNOS gene expression in birds fed the NSM100, NSM200, LSM100 and LSM200 diets compared to the control group. Moreover, all groups receiving silymarin showed a significant decrease in liver weight compare to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the effects of silymarin when converted to NSM or LSM and offered at the level of 200 mg/kg BW were more pronounced on the hepatic variables and may be useful in the prevention of the liver disease in older laying hens.",

Silymarin has potential to be a renoprotective agent for nephrotoxic drugs due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. The aim of this clinical study is evaluating the potential effects of silymarin on preventing vancomycin nephrotoxicity. A multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was conducted on patients with the indication of systemic vancomycin for at least 7 days. Patients were screened daily and those who met the inclusion criteria were selected and randomly assigned into either silymarin or placebo groups. Accordingly, 140 mg silymarin tablet (Livergol®) or placebo was given orally three times daily. Silymarin or placebo were provided in conjunction with vancomycin for at least 7 days. If vancomycin therapy was extended beyond 7 days, the administration of silymarin or placebo was continued until the end of vancomycin treatment. Malondialdehyde, glutathione, and total antioxidant capacity were measured in the serum on days 0 and 7. A trough level of vancomycin was assessed 30 min before the fifth dose of vancomycin. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was monitored in each patient daily during the course of vancomycin treatment. The causality assessment of all identified cases of vancomycin associated AKI was performed by the Naranjo scale. The primary endpoint was vancomycin nephrotoxicity. It was defined based on the KDIGO 2012 criteria for AKI as either an increase of 0.3 units or more in serum creatinine level during 48 h or 50% (1.5-fold) or more during 7 days compared to baseline values. During the study period, 34 patients in the silymarin group and 32 patients in the placebo group completed the clinical trial. Demographic, baseline clinical, and laboratory characteristics were comparable between placebo and silymarin groups. The number of patients with AKI on days 5, 6, 7, 11,12, 13, and 14 in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the silymarin group (p-value < 0.05). The incidence of acute tubular injury on the day  5 and 7 of vancomycin treatment was significantly lower in the silymarin group (p-value = 0.005 and p-value = 0.032, respectively). Antioxidant indexes including serum total antioxidant capacity and glutathione significantly increased in the silymarin group (p-value < 0.001 for both indexes). In contrast, serum malondialdehyde as an end product of lipid peroxidation pathway significantly decreased in the silymarin group during 7 days (p-value < 0.001). The results of the present pilot, clinical trial suggested that silymarin co-administration may prevent vancomycin nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurochemical dysregulations resulting from N-methyl-D-aspartate hypofunction (NMDA), are exacerbated by neuroimmune and oxidative stress and are known risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia-like diseases. Here, we investigate the protective and curative effects, and mechanisms of silymarin, a polyphenolic flavonoid with neuroprotective functions in preventive-reversal model of ketamine, an NMDA antagonist in mice. METHODS: Mice were grouped into 6 cohorts (n = 9). In the pre-treatment, groups 1 and 2 received saline (10 mL/kg/p.o.), groups 3 and 4 (silymarin, 50 and 100 mg/kg/p.o.), and group 5 (risperidone, 0.5 mg/kg/p.o.) consecutively for 14 days, then combined with ketamine (20 mg/kg/i.p.) injection in groups 2-5 from days 8-14. However, mice in reversal study received intraperitoneal injection of ketamine for 14 days before silymarin (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o) and risperidone (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment between days 8-14. The consequences on schizophrenia-like behavior, neurochemistry, inflammation, and oxidative/nitrergic stress markers were evaluated in critical brain regions of the disease. RESULTS: Silymarin prevented and reversed ketamine-induced increase in dopamine, 5-hydroxyltryptamine, acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde and nitrite levels in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampus. These were accompanied by improvement in hyperlocomotion, stereotypy, memory, and social impairments, notably devoid of cataleptogenic potential. Complementarily, silymarin reduced myeloperoxidase, tumor-necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 concentrations relative to the ketamine group. Moreover, ketamine-induced decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glutathione, catalase, superoxide-dismutase levels were normalized by silymarin in the brain regions relative to ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings suggest that silymarin's antipsychotic effect might be primarily associated, among other mechanisms, with the normalization of neurochemical and neurotrophic changes in the mice brains.",

This study was conducted to determine the effect of silymarin on the prevention and treatment of calcium chloride-induced arrhythmia. In total, 48 male rats were randomly divided into six groups: the first control group for acute administration received intravenous injection of 0.2 mL of dimethylsulfoxide, a cosolvent, immediately after induction of arrhythmia; the second control group for chronic administration, daily gavage of dimethylsulfoxide for 2 weeks before induction of arrhythmia; acute silymarin group, 100 mg/kg intravenous, immediately after the occurrence of arrhythmia; chronic silymarin group, daily gavage of 50 mg/kg for 2 weeks before induction of arrhythmia; amiodarone standard treatment, 5 mg/kg intravenous, immediately after induction of arrhythmia; and quinidine standard treatment, 10 mg/kg intravenous, immediately after induction of arrhythmia. Calcium chloride (140 mg/kg, i.v.) was used to induce arrhythmia. Electrocardiogram was recorded and monitored by PowerLab™ system. The incidence rates of premature ventricular beat (PVB), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF) were calculated. The antiarrhythmic effect of silymarin was observed with a significant decrease in the incidence of premature ventricular beat (22.56 ± 1.04%, P < 0.001), ventricular tachycardia (34.150 ± 1.59%, P < 0.001), and ventricular fibrillation (24.31 ± 1.02%, P < 0.001) compared with the control group (100%). These effects were comparable to antiarrhythmic drugs such as quinidine (29.23% ± 1.24%, 52.23% ± 1.13%, 66.31% ± 1.81%) and amiodarone (22.91% ± .72%, 41.09% ± 1.66%, 61.59% ± 1.11%).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases globally that may have side effects on liver and renal function. Pharmacological treatments to reduce adverse liver and renal effects are still limited. It has been proposed that silymarin may possess hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. The present trial aims to assess the hepatorenal protective efficacy of silymarin supplementation in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. METHOD: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that recruited female breast cancer patients. Participants were randomly assigned to one placebo group and two intervention groups. The control group received 140 mg of placebo daily, while the two intervention groups received 140 mg silymarin daily. Follow-up assessments were conducted at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. At the beginning of the study, the patients were subjected to a computed tomography (CT) scan, and the liver and renal parameters such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine (Cr) were examined through laboratory tests. RESULTS: Despite two deaths and three dropouts, 100 patients completed the study. Silymarin showed significant effects on liver enzymes in the levels of ALP and bilirubin (P < 0.05), with no significant impact on renal function in the levels of Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine (Cr) (P > 0.05). The medication was well-tolerated, with minimal reported side effects (P > 0.05). DISCUSSION: The study suggests that silymarin may have hepato-renal protective potential in breast cancer patients and improve patient tolerance to chemotherapy. The data presented on the efficacy and safety of silymarin may provide stronger foundation for further trials and for a possible use in clinical practice.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) mainly leads to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men. The present study investigates the role of cholecalciferol, Silymarin, and their combined administration in patients with BPH suffering from LUTS. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, controlled trial enrolled 80 participants (50-80 years) diagnosed with BPH, from March 2019 to March 2020. Based on serum 25-(OH) vitamin D levels we formed subgroups, each receiving specific interventions. Measurements of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Maximal Urinary Flow Rate (Q-max), Prostate Volume (PV), Post-Void Residual (PVR), and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) were recorded at baseline and following 3 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Participants with serum concentration of 25-(OH) vitamin D below 20 ng/ml simultaneously received cholecalciferol and Silymarin that significantly improved IPSS, irritation, obstruction, PV, and PVR. In those with concentrations ⩾20 ng/ml, a single use of Silymarin significantly reduced IPSS, irritation, obstruction, and PVR. Adjustment of confounding variables revealed independent and significant effects of both cholecalciferol and Silymarin on PVR, IPSS, and obstruction. Cholecalciferol also improved irritation, while Silymarin reduced prostate volume. These findings highlight potential therapeutic benefits for BPH-associated LUTS, encouraging further exploration and clinical consideration. CONCLUSIONS: In this investigation, combination therapy with cholecalciferol at 50,000 IU/w for 8 weeks and Silymarin at a dosage of 480 mg for 3 months resulted in a notable improvement in the IPSS score, PV, and PVR, as well as both irritative and obstructive symptoms. However, the total PSA and free PSA amounts did not reach a significant difference.",

This study evaluated the effect of silymarin, a potent antioxidant, on the quality of sperm and testicular tissue in mice treated with cyclophosphamide. NMRI adult male mice were divided into four groups: control; cyclophosphamide (intraperitoneal injection, 100 mg/kg, once a week); cyclophosphamide + silymarin; and silymarin (intraperitoneal injection, 200 mg/kg, every other day). After a 35-day treatment period, the caudal region of the epididymis was examined for sperm parameters, the right testis was used for stereological studies, and the left testis was used to assess biochemical factors. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS software, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. In the cyclophosphamide group, there was a significant reduction in the mean total volume of testicular tissue, the average volume of seminiferous tubules and their components, and the average volume of interstitial tissue. Additionally, there was a notable decrease (p < 0.001) in the average number of Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and sperm parameters. The mean concentration of testosterone hormone (p < 0.05) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) level (p < 0.01) also significantly decreased, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) level increased significantly (p < 0.05). However, these adverse changes were mitigated in the cyclophosphamide + silymarin group compared to the cyclophosphamide group. Our results showed that silymarin as an antioxidant can mitigate the adverse effects of cyclophosphamide on testicular tissue and sperm parameters.",

In the present study, we fabricated a natural alginate-chitosan hydrogel comprising silymarin and green-synthesized zinc ‎oxide ‎nanoparticles (ZnO NPs). Then, the physicochemical attributes of ZnO NPs and loaded hydrogels were analyzed. Afterward, wound healing efficacy was evaluated in a rat model of full-thickness dermal burn wounds. The findings indicated that ZnO NPs were synthesized via reduction with phytochemicals from Elettaria cardamomum seeds extract. The microscopic images exhibited fairly spherical ZnO NPs (35-45 nm), and elemental analysis verified the relevant composition. The hydrogel, containing silymarin and biosynthesized ZnO NPs, displayed a uniform appearance, smooth surfaces, and a porous structure. Moreover, infrared spectroscopy ‎identified functional groups, confirming the successful loading without adverse interactions. The obtained hydrogel exhibited great water absorption, high porosity, sustainable degradation for several days, and enhanced antioxidant capability of the combined loaded component. In vivo studies revealed faster and superior wound healing, achieving nearly complete closure by day 21. Histopathology confirmed improved cell growth, tissue regeneration, collagen deposition, and neovascularization. It is believed that this multifunctional hydrogel-based wound dressing can be applied for effective burn wound treatment.",

      "abstract": "AIM: There is a need for effective treatments for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that are economically inexpensive, and have few side effects. The present study aimed to investigate exercise training and silymarin on hepatocyte death factors in rats with liver damage. METHODS: Forty-nine male Wistar rats were assigned to seven groups: sedentary control, fatty liver control (DEX), fatty liver + high-intensity interval training (HIIT), fatty liver + HIIT + silymarin (HIIT + SILY), fatty liver + continuous training (CT), fatty liver + CT + silymarin (CT + SILY), and fatty liver + silymarin (SILY). A subcutaneous injection of dexamethasone for 7 days was used to induce fatty liver in rats. Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin staining were done to evaluate hepatic injury. The hepatocyte apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay. Real-Time PCR was conducted to evaluate the gene expressions of caspase-9, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKα1), mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), and damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM). Liver tissue changes and serum levels of liver enzymes were also evaluated. RESULTS: Liver apoptosis was decreased in the CT, HIIT, HIIT + SILY and CT + SILY groups compared to the DEX group. Both continuous and high-intensity training models produced beneficial alterations in liver morphology and hepatic injuries that were significant in exercise training + silymarin group. This impact was accompanied by increased AMPKα1 and DRAM gene expression and decreased caspase-9 and Mfn2 gene expression. Liver enzyme levels were high in the DEX group and treatment with silymarin significantly reduced it. CONCLUSION: Silymarin supplementation combined with interval or continuous training substantially improves DEX-induced hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte injury mostly through suppressing liver apoptosis and upregulating autophagy, which may provide a novel perspective for NAFLD treatment.",

The study aims to develop, optimize, and evaluate a novel stable SLM NLC gel to improve anti-psoriatic activity by enhancing its permeability and retention into the dermal layer. SLM NLC formulation was prepared and optimized using 32 full factorial designs. The formulation was evaluated for the particle size, PDI, zeta potential, and % entrapment efficiency, evaluated by Transmission electron microscopy and thermal analysis. The freeze dried and prepared NLC-loaded gel was evaluated for physicochemical parameters, ex-vivo, and in-vivo studies. SLM-loaded NLC shows 624 nm particle size, 0.41 PDI, 92.95% entrapment efficiency, and -31.6 mV zeta potential. The sphere form of NLCs was confirmed using TEM. Controlled drug release was observed in ex vivo studies, low PASI score compared to disease control. Further, the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB were also reduced. The results are supported by histopathology showing minimal parakeratosis indicated in the SLM NLC-treated group. Prepared NLC-based shows enhance topical penetration and decrease the thickness of psoriatic plaques in the in vivo study.",

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the efficacy of oral silymarin combined with hair follicle transplantation compared to follicle transplantation alone in the treatment of refractory vitiligo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty refractory vitiligo patients were enrolled in this randomized controlled clinical trial, following up for 3 months. One group underwent hair transplantation plus oral silymarin, while the other group underwent follicle transplantation alone. We assessed the progress with Vitiligo Extent Tensity Index (VETI) in both groups and the peri-follicular pigmentation diameter was estimated monthly. The Friedman test for comparing two groups at the end and the Mann-Whitney test for comparing two groups during each month was used. RESULTS: The mean age was 30.22 (18-59) years, with the male to female ratio of 1:1. The decrease in the VETI and increase in the perifollicular pigmentation was statistically significant between silymarin and another group in monthly follow-up (p-value: 0.019, 0.019, and 0.035, respectively). Finally, the re-pigmentation was notable in silymarin group (p-value <0.001 vs. 0.029, respectively). In addition, both genders had a significant increase in peri-follicular re-pigmentation in the last follow-up (p-value: 0.012 and 0.044, respectively); although the improvement was not statistically significant between genders in each month. CONCLUSION: According to our study, silymarin in combination with hair transplantation could be a potential medical treatment for vitiligo; however, further trials are needed to establish the efficacy of combination therapies.",

      "abstract": "Silymarin, a bioflavonoid derived from the Silybum marianum plant, was discovered in 1960. It contains C25 and has been extensively used as a therapeutic agent against liver-related diseases caused by alcohol addiction, acute viral hepatitis, and toxins-inducing liver failure. Its efficacy stems from its role as a potent anti-oxidant and scavenger of free radicals, employed through various mechanisms. Additionally, silymarin or silybin possesses immunomodulatory characteristics, impacting immune-enhancing and immune-suppressive functions. Recently, silymarin has been recognized as a potential neuroprotective therapy for various neurological conditions, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, along with conditions related to cerebral ischemia. Its hepatoprotective qualities, primarily due to its anti-oxidant and tissue-regenerating properties, are well-established. Silymarin also enhances health by modifying processes such as inflammation, β-amyloid accumulation, cellular estrogenic receptor mediation, and apoptotic machinery. While believed to reduce oxidative stress and support neuroprotective mechanisms, these effects represent just one aspect of the compound's multifaceted protective action. This review article further delves into the possibilities of potential therapeutic advancement of silymarin and silibinin for the management of neurodegenerative disorders via mechanics modules.",

In this study, the effect of silymarin and rosuvastatin on serum markers and clinical outcomes in dyslipidemic AD patients was investigated. METHODS: Participants (n=36) were randomized to silymarin (140 mg), placebo, and rosuvastatin 10 mg orally three times a day for 6 months. Serum collection and clinical outcome tests were performed at baseline and after completion of treatment. Lipid profile markers, oxidative stress markers, Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, and Soluble Low-density lipoprotein receptor-Related Protein-1 (sLRP1)/Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE) ratio were measured. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in Δ-high density lipoprotein (ΔHDL) between silymarin and placebo (P<0.000) and also between rosuvastatin and placebo (p=0.044). The level of Δ-triglycerides (ΔTG) in the silymarin group has a significant decrease compared to both the placebo and the rosuvastatin group (p<0.000 and p=0.036, respectively). The Δ-superoxide dismutase (ΔSOD) level in the silymarin group compared to placebo and rosuvastatin had a significant increase (p<0.000 and p=0.008, respectively). The ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 in the silymarin group compared to both the placebo and rosuvastatin groups had a significant increase (p<0.05). There was an inverse relationship between ΔTG and ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 (p=-0.493 and p=0.004). ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 has a direct statistical relationship with ΔSOD marker (p=0.388 and p=0.031). Also, there was a direct correlation between the level of ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and ΔsLRP1/sRAGE (p=0.491 and p=0.005). CONCLUSION: Our study showed the relationship between plasma lipids, especially ΔTG and ΔHDL, with ΔAβ1-42/Aβ1-40 in dyslipidemic AD patients, and modulation of these lipid factors can be used to monitor the response to treatments."

      "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a scarce neurodegenerative disorder defined by chorea (unusual involuntary movements), behavioral presentations, psychiatric features, and cognitive deterioration. Although the precise pathogenic mechanism behind HD has not yet been identified, the most widely acknowledged pathways include excitotoxicity, mitochondrial malfunction, neuroinflammation, neurochemical imbalance, oxidative stress, and apoptosis HD has no efficient therapy. Current medications have drawbacks. Silymarin, a compound made up of standardized extracts obtained from the seeds of the Silybum marianum and polyphenolic flavonolignan, is utilized in therapeutic settings to treat a variety of experimental disorders in animals. Silymarin's key pharmacological activities include anti-cancer, hepatoprotection, antioxidant, cardioprotection, and anti-inflammatory. It also has no adverse side effects on people or animals. The current study aims to provide Silymarin's neuro-pharmacological activities or therapeutic qualities in HD. In this study, Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g, 8 weeks) at the initial of the study were used. Silymarin solution (100 mg/Kg) was administered by oral gavage for 21 days to ameliorate neural damage in rats injected with 3-nitropropionicacid (3-NP) in a preliminary rat model of HD. The results showed that administration of silymarin to HD rats reduced gliosis, improved motor coordination and muscle activity, and increased striatal volume and the number of neurons and glial cells. Our results suggest that silymarin provides a protective environment for nerve cells and can have beneficial effects against the harmful effects of HD.",

The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of micelle silymarin on the performance, egg quality, blood profile, and absorption rate of silymarin in laying hens. In experiment 1: 288 Hy-Line brown laying hens, 28 wk old, were utilized for this experiment. The hens were randomly allocated into 3 dietary treatment groups, with each group comprising eight replicates of 12 hens, each housed in individual pens with access to feed and water. Over a 12-wk feeding trial, the hens were provided with a basal diet supplemented with different levels of MS: 0, 0.03, and 0.06%. In experiment 2: For this experiment, 192 Hy-Line Brown laying hens were divided into 2 dietary treatment groups, with each group comprising eight replications of 12 hens. The dietary treatments were: TRT1, basal diet + powder silymarin 4%; TRT2, basal diet + MS 4%. From the first experiment, the findings revealed that incorporating micelle silymarin (MS) into the hens' diet significantly increased egg weight at wk 6 (P < 0.05). Similarly, at wk 12 and throughout the entire experiment, significant effects were observed on downgraded egg count, egg production, egg weight, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P < 0.05). Moreover, Haugh Units (HU) and albumen height showed a linear improvement (P < 0.05) at wk 4 with MS supplementation. Furthermore, there was a linear increase in egg yolk color, albumen height, and eggshell thickness at wk 8 with MS supplementation (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a layers-fed diet supplemented with MS showed a linear increase (P < 0.05) in HU, egg weight, yolk color, albumen height, eggshell strength, and eggshell thickness in wk 12. Regarding blood profile parameters, the study revealed linear reductions for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P < 0.05), whereas there was a tendency for albumin, triglyceride, and cholesterol (P < 0.10). In the second experiment, it was observed that the blood absorption rate of silymarin was higher in TRT2 compared to TRT1 at 2- and 4-h intervals following administration. In summary, increasing MS supplementation in the diet of laying hens enhanced egg production, egg quality, and blood profile. Additionally, silymarin absorption was higher in its micelle form than in its powder form.",

Thirty female Wistar rats were randomly allocated into five different groups. All the experimental animals except the normal control (Group I) were administered CCl4. Additionally, Groups II, III, IV, and V were treated with gum acacia, silymarin, dapagliflozin, and a combination of dapagliflozin and silymarin, respectively, for 14 days. Dapagliflozin, silymarin alone, and in combination, significantly reduced (p < 0.05) serum levels of ALT, AST, AST:ALT ratio, and total bilirubin compared to CCl4-intoxicated control rats. There was a notable reduction (p < 0.05) observed in the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, nitrites, and 4-hydroxynonenal, accompanied by an elevation in catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in liver homogenates of the groups treated with dapagliflozin, silymarin alone, and in combination, as compared to the CCl4-intoxicated control group. Dapagliflozin in combination with silymarin showed a synergistic hepatoprotective effect. Our study reveals the profound hepatoprotective potential of dapagliflozin alone and in combination with silymarin in CCl4-intoxicated Wistar rats by modulating the Nrf2 and HO-1 signaling pathways."

In this study, the effects of Silymarin on proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells and its impact on immune response against cancer cells were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The effect of Silymarin on CT-26 and Caco-2 cells proliferation and apoptosis were demonstrated by MTT assay and PI staining. A subcutaneous tumor of colorectal cancer was developed. Silymarin and Doxorubicin were administrated by intravenous injection. qRT-PCR analyses was performed on blood samples and tumor tissues. Spleen tissue was used to evaluate CD8+ T cell immune responses. Histological study was carried out on tumor tissues. RESULTS: Silymarin showed anti-proliferative effects on CT-26 and Caco-2 cells. The markers of immunogenic cell death (Calreticulin exposure, ATP secretion, and HMGB1 secretion) significantly increased in both cell lines in the presence of silymarin. The expression of genes related to cell proliferation particularly β-Catenin and Cycline D1, and also anti-apoptotic ones such as Bcl-2 significantly reduced in mice treated with Silymarin while the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax increased. The RNA level of PD-L1 decreased in tumor tissues exposed by Silymarin. Moreover, the number of CTLs increased in the spleen of mice treated with Silymarin in comparison with untreated mice. Decreased tumor size and also survival of colorectal cancer cells in Silymarin-treated mice were observed in histological analysis. CONCLUSION: Silymarin treatment showed a suppressive role on colorectal cancer cells almost as much as Doxorubicin. Our study indicated that having a low toxicity profile, cost-effectiveness, and availability of raw materials, plant-derived Silymarin can be a good candidate for further investigation to treat CRC.",

Prebiotics and probiotics have shown promise in NAFLD management. This study evaluated a silymarin-based herbal remedy with piperine and fulvic acid, alongside a probiotic blend of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Using a NAFLD mouse model induced by a high-fat and high-fructose diet, we assessed biochemical parameters, liver function, glucose levels, and conducted histological analysis. Stool samples underwent 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis to explore changes in microbiota composition. Mice on the high-fat diet exhibited elevated lipids, liver enzymes, and glucose, with reduced high-density lipoprotein levels (with p value < 0.001). Treatment, particularly with F3 (silymarin-piperine-fulvic acid herbal remedy and probiotic blend), significantly reduced hepatic fat accumulation and improved gut microbiota composition. This study highlights the potential of silymarin-based therapy combined with probiotics in attenuating NAFLD progression."

DNA was extracted and investigated for the existence of possible new mutations in the gene encoding CTRP3 using the PCR technique; the desired fragments were then amplified and sequenced. Another blood sample was collected from the case group after taking livergol for three months (3 doses of 140 mg/day) and the tests were repeated. Anti-CCP Abs levels in the postintervention responding group decreased compared to preintervention (p<0.001) while in the non-responding group, the levels increased after the intervention compared to the levels before the intervention (p=0.019). Additionally, CTRP3 levels in the responding group increased postintervention (p=0.003), however, in the non-responding group the levels decreased postintervention when compared to preintervention (p=0.02). The responding group had significantly lower levels of hs-CRP when compared to that of preintervention (p=0.005) whereas the non-responding group had significantly higher levels of postintervention (p<0.001). Moreover, the results of sequencings of exon 6 on CTRP3 gene showed the presence of mutations in exon 6 (position 215:C>T, 338:G>A, 359:A>C, and 153:T>C).

However, its role in the prevention and treatment of chicken coccidiosis remains unclear. This study investigated the efficacy of various doses of silymarin in preventing and treating Eimeria tenella infection in chicks. A total of 180 one-day-old specific pathogen-free chicks were randomized into six groups of 30 chicks each, no treatment (NC group); E. tenella infection (CC group); diclazuril medication during d 14 to 21 and E. tenella infection (DC group); and three groups infected with E. tenella and administered low, medium, or high doses of silymarin during d 12 to 21. All groups except NC were infected with E. tenella on d 14, with indicators observed on d 21. The growth performance was higher in the silymarin treated groups than that in the CC group, and the oocyst count per gram of manure, blood stool, and cecal lesion scores decreased. The medium-dose silymarin group exhibited the best treatment effect. Additionally, the silymarin groups displayed improved histological, morphology, and intestinal barrier integrity. The amounts of proinflammatory factors and harmful bacteria in the cecum were also reduced. Additionally, the activity of serum and cecal antioxidant enzymes, as well as the abundance of beneficial gut microbiota, increased in the cecum. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that silymarin can prevent and treat E. tenella infections. These data provide a scientific and conceptual basis for the development of a botanical dietary supplement from silymarin for the treatment and control of coccidiosis in chicks.",

Oxidative stress, a disruption in the balance between antioxidants and oxidants, is a crucial factor in its pathogenesis. Silymarin, a flavonoid extracted from milk thistle, has shown therapeutic potential in inhibiting cancer cell growth, promoting apoptosis, and reducing inflammation. It also regulates oxidative stress. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effects of silymarin on oxidative stress parameters, especially the transcription factor Nrf2 and its related enzymes in GBM cancer cells, to develop a new anti-cancer compound with low toxicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: First, the cytotoxicity of silymarin on U-87 MG cells was investigated by MTT and the results showed an IC50 of 264.6 μM. Then, some parameters of the redox system were measured with commercial kits, and the obtained results showed that silymarin increased the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes, as well as the total antioxidant capacity levels; while the malondialdehyde level that is an indicator of lipid peroxidation was decreased by this compound. The expression level of Nrf2 and HO-1 and glutaredoxin and thioredoxin enzymes were checked by real-time PCR method, and the expression level increased significantly after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that silymarin may exert its cytotoxic and anticancer effects by enhancing the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway through antioxidant mechanisms in U-87 MG cells.",

Hence, developing advanced strategies for effective and targeted delivery of antileishmanial agents is crucial. Several drug delivery carriers have been developed till current date for dermal/transdermal delivery, especially those which are fabricated using eco-friendly synthesis approaches, since they protect the environment from the harmful effects of chemical waste disposal. This work describes the preparation of selenium nanoparticles loaded with silymarin via one-pot green reduction technique, for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The selected silymarin loaded selenium nanoparticles (SSNs4-0.1) displayed good loading efficiency of 58.22 ± 0.56 %, zeta potential of -30.63 ± 0.40 mV, hydrodynamic diameter of 245.77 ± 11.12 nm, and polydispersity index of 0.19 ± 0.01. It exhibited good physical stability, as well as high ex vivo deposition % in the epidermis (46.98 ± 1.51 %) and dermis (35.23 ± 1.72 %), which was further proven using confocal laser microscopy. It also exhibited significant cytocompatibility and noticeable cellular internalization of 90.02 ± 3.81 % in human fibroblasts, as well as high trypanothione reductase inhibitory effect (97.10 ± 0.30 %). Results of this study confirmed the successful green synthesis of silymarin-loaded selenium nanoparticles; delineating them as one of the promising antileishmanial topical delivery systems.",

The rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections at a dose of 2 mg per kilogram of body weight of PAX for 5 successive days, followed by oral gavage with 200 mg/kg body mass of SIL for 10 uninterrupted days. We examined the effect of SIL on specific serum biochemical parameters using an autoanalyzer and rat-specific kits. The spectrophotometric methods was used to investigate oxidative stress indicators in kidney and liver tissues. Aquaporin-2 (AQP-2), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), cysteine aspartate-specific protease-3 (caspase-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and streptavidin-biotin staining were used to assess immunoreactivity in PAX-induced liver and kidney injury models. RESULTS: SIL treatment significantly reduced serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, urea, and C-reactive protein, indicating its effectiveness in treating PAX-induced liver and kidney injury. SIL treatment significantly reduced oxidative stress by increasing essential antioxidant parameters, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione. It also reduced malondialdehyde levels in liver and kidney tissues of SIL-PAX groups (p < 0.05). SIL administration reduced NF-κB, caspase-3, and IL-6 expression while increasing Bcl-2 and AQP2 levels in liver and kidney tissues of rats treated with SIL and PAX (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the potential of SIL to alleviate PAX-induced liver and kidney damage in rats by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptotic processes.",

The primary goal of this research was to investigate how MS impacts the performance, egg quality, water loss and blood profile of laying hens. 288 Hy-Line brown laying hens, 28 weeks in age, were utilized for this experiment. The hens were randomly allocated into three dietary treatment groups, with each group comprising eight replicates of 12 hens, each housed in individual pens with access to feed and water. Over a 12-week feeding trial, the hens were provided with a basal diet supplemented with different levels of MS: 0%, 0.03% and 0.06%. The results indicated that the inclusion of MS in the hens' diet did not have a significant impact on their performance (p > 0.05). However, Haugh units, egg weight and eggshell strength showed a linear improvement (p < 0.05) throughout the entire trial period with MS supplementation. Furthermore, there was a linear decrease in egg yolk colour and eggshell thickness showed linear improvements (p < 0.05), particularly during Week 8, with MS supplementation. Moreover, layers fed diet supplemented with MS showed a linear increased (p < 0.05) in albumen height and eggshell thickness in Week 12. In addition, egg water loss during Week 12, the third day of incubation, linearly decreased as an effect of the increasing level of the MS in the laying hen's diet (p < 0.05). Regarding blood profile parameters, the study revealed a tendency for alkaline phosphatase to decrease, whereas aspartate aminotransferase and cholesterol levels were linearly decreased (p < 0.05). In summary, increasing the level of MS supplementation in the diet of laying hens appeared to be beneficial in improving egg quality, slight improvement for egg water loss and certain aspects of blood profile parameters, without adversely affecting the hens' growth performance.",

      "abstract": "Silymarin, derived from Silybum marianum, has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments. In this study, the cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects of silymarin against paracetamol-induced oxidative stress were examined in 28 male Swiss Webster mice, divided into four groups and treated for 7 days (via the oral route) with (a) saline 1 mL/kg (control group), (b) saline 1 mL/kg + single dose of paracetamol 110 mg/kg on the 7th day; (c) silymarin 50 mg/kg; and (d) silymarin 50 mg/kg + single dose of paracetamol 110 mg/kg on the 7th day. In vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity together with liver enzyme activity were evaluated. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assessment was performed. Silymarin mitigated paracetamol-induced liver injury by reducing oxidative stress markers such as lipid peroxidation and restoring antioxidant enzyme activity. Silymarin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in liver enzyme levels. Reduced necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate in liver tissues of silymarin-treated groups were detected as well. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated reduced expression of inflammatory markers (COX2, iNOS) and oxidative stress marker (SOD2) in the liver tissues of the silymarin-treated groups. Similar trends were observed in cardiac tissue. These results suggest that silymarin exerts potent hepatoprotective and cardioprotective effects against paracetamol-induced oxidative stress, making it a promising therapeutic agent for liver and heart diseases associated with oxidative damage."

      "abstract": "Silymarin, salvianolic acids B, and puerarin were considered healthy food agents with tremendous potential to ameliorate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the mechanisms by which they interact with gut microbiota to exert benefits are largely unknown. After 8 weeks of NAFLD modeling, C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into five groups and fed a normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD supplemented with a medium or high dose of Silybum marianum extract contained silymarin or polyherbal extract contained silymarin, salvianolic acids B, and puerarin for 16 weeks, respectively. The untargeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing were used for molecular mechanisms exploration. The intervention of silymarin and polyherbal extract significantly improved liver steatosis and recovered liver function in the mice, accompanied by an increase in probiotics like Akkermansia and Blautia, and suppressed Clostridium, which related to changes in the bile acids profile in feces and serum. Fecal microbiome transplantation confirmed that this alteration of microbiota and its metabolites were responsible for the improvement in NAFLD. The present study substantiated that alterations of the gut microbiota upon silymarin and polyherbal extract intervention have beneficial effects on HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and suggested the pivotal role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in the amelioration of NAFLD.",

This response develops away from the primary infection site and results in end-organ damage. The present study aimed to investigate the protective and therapeutic effects on lung and kidney tissue of silymarin (S) and dexmedetomidine (DEX) applied 1 h before and after sepsis induced by the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method in rats. A total of 62 rats was randomly divided into eight groups: i) Control (n=6); ii) cecal perforation (CLP; n=8); iii) S + CLP (n=8; S + CLP; S administered 1 h before CPL); iv) CLP + S (n=8; S administered 1 h after CLP); v) DEX + CLP (n=8; D + CLP; DEX administered 1 h before CLP); vi) CLP + D (n=8; DEX administered 1 h after CLP); vii) SD + CLP (n=8; S and DEX administered 1 h before CLP) and viii) CLP + SD (n=8; S and DEX administered 1 h after CLP). After the cecum filled with stool, it was tied with 3/0 silk under the ileocecal valve and the anterior surface of the cecum was punctured twice with an 18-gauge needle. A total of 100 mg/kg silymarin and 100 µg/kg DEX were administered intraperitoneally to the treatment groups. Lung and kidney tissue samples were collected to evaluate biochemical and histopathological parameters. In the histopathological examination, all parameters indicating kidney injury; interstitial edema, peritubular capillary dilatation, vacuolization, ablation of tubular epithelium from the basement membrane, loss of brush border in the proximal tubule epithelium, cell swelling and nuclear defragmentation; were increased in the CLP compared with the control group. Silymarin administration increased kidney damage, including ablation of tubular epithelium from the basement membrane, compared with that in the CLP group. DEX significantly reduced kidney damage compared with the CLP and silymarin groups. The co-administration of DEX + silymarin decreased kidney damage, although it was not as effective as DEX-alone. To conclude, intraperitoneal DEX ameliorated injury in CLP rats. DEX + silymarin partially ameliorated injury but silymarin administration increased damage. As a result, silymarin has a negative effects with this dosage and DEX has a protective effect. In the present study, it was determined that using the two drugs together had a greater therapeutic effect than silymarin and no differences in the effects were not observed any when the application times of the agents were changed."

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the kidney protective potentials of silymarin (SM) and exosomes of mesenchymal stem cells against the nephrotoxin thioacetamide (TAA) in rats. METHODS: 32 female rats were randomly assigned into four groups: the control group, the TAA group, the TAA + SM group, and the TAA + Exosomes group. The kidney homogenates from all groups were examined for expression levels of TGF-β receptors I and II using real-time PCR, expression levels of collagen type I and CTGF proteins using ELISA, and the expression levels of nuclear SMAD2/3/4, cytoplasmic SMAD2/3, and cytoplasmic SMAD4 proteins using the western blot technique. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the injection of TAA resulted in a significant increase in serum levels of urea and creatinine, gene expression levels of TβRI and TβRII, protein expression levels of both collagen I and CTGF proteins, cytoplasmic SMAD2/3 complex, and nuclear SMAD2/3/4 (p-value < 0.0001), with significantly decreased levels of the co-SMAD partner, SMAD4 (p-value < 0.0001). Those effects were reversed considerably in both treatment groups, with the superiority of the exosomal treatment regarding the SMAD proteins and the expression levels of the TβRI gene, collagen I, and CTGF proteins returning to near-control values (p-value > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Using in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches, the research discovered a reno-protective role of silymarin and exosomes of BM-MSCs after thioacetamide-induced renal fibrosis in rats, with the advantage of exosomes.",

The results demonstrate significant novelty and promising outcomes in terms of morphology, size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release behavior, free energy profiles of Syl across the niosome bilayer, hydrogen bonding interactions, antimicrobial properties, cytotoxicity, and in vivo evaluations. The physical appearance, size, and morphology assessment of free niosomes and Syl-loaded niosomes indicated stable and well-formed vesicular structures suitable for drug delivery. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed spherical shapes with distinct sizes for each formulation, confirming uniform distribution. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis confirmed the size distribution results with higher polydispersity index for Syl-loaded niosomes. The encapsulation efficiency of Syl in the niosomes was remarkable at approximately 91%, ensuring protection and controlled release of the drug. In vitro release studies showed a sustained release profile for Syl-loaded niosomes, enhancing therapeutic efficacy over time. Free energy profiles analysis identified energy barriers hindering Syl permeation through the niosome bilayer, emphasizing challenges in drug delivery system design. Hydrogen bonding interactions between Syl and niosome components contributed to energy barriers, impacting drug permeability. Antimicrobial assessments revealed significant differences in inhibitory effects against S. aureus and E. coli. Cytotoxicity evaluations demonstrated the superior tumor-killing potential of Syl-loaded niosomes compared to free Syl. In vivo studies indicated niosome formulations' safety profiles in terms of liver and kidney parameters compared to bulk Syl, showcasing potential for clinical applications. Overall, this research highlights the promising potential of Syl-loaded niosomes as effective drug delivery systems with enhanced stability, controlled release, and improved therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease with a high prevalence worldwide and poses serious harm to human health. There is growing evidence suggesting that the administration of specific supplements or nutrients may slow NAFLD progression. Silymarin is a hepatoprotective extract of milk thistle, but its efficacy in NAFLD remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinicaltrails.gov, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure and were screened according to the eligibility criteria. Data were analyzed using Revman 5.3. Continuous values and dichotomous values were pooled using the standard mean difference (SMD) and odds ratio (OR). Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran's Q test (I2 statistic). A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 26 randomized controlled trials involving 2,375 patients were included in this study. Administration of silymarin significantly reduced the levels of TC (SMD[95%CI]=-0.85[-1.23, -0.47]), TG (SMD[95%CI]=-0.62[-1.14, -0.10]), LDL-C (SMD[95%CI]=-0.81[-1.31, -0.31]), FI (SMD[95%CI]=-0.59[-0.91, -0.28]) and HOMA-IR (SMD[95%CI]=-0.37[-0.77, 0.04]), and increased the level of HDL-C (SMD[95%CI]=0.46[0.03, 0.89]). In addition, silymarin attenuated liver injury as indicated by the decreased levels of ALT (SMD[95%CI]=-12.39[-19.69, -5.08]) and AST (SMD[95% CI]=-10.97[-15.51, -6.43]). The levels of fatty liver index (SMD[95%CI]=-6.64[-10.59, -2.69]) and fatty liver score (SMD[95%CI]=-0.51[-0.69, -0.33]) were also decreased. Liver histology of the intervention group revealed significantly improved hepatic steatosis (OR[95%CI]=3.25[1.80, 5.87]). CONCLUSIONS: Silymarin can regulate energy metabolism, attenuate liver damage, and improve liver histology in NAFLD patients. However, the effects of silymarin will need to be confirmed by further research.",

AIMS: The objective of these studies was to evaluate a silymarin antioxidant serum alone and in combination with a prescription acne treatment regimen in improving facial appearance in blemish-prone skin.&nbsp; Methods: Two international studies were conducted. A 12-week study in Brazil enrolled 56 subjects to examine the effect of silymarin antioxidant serum on facial acne. Clinical grading on acne lesions, skin tone, clarity, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) were conducted. In addition, consumer self-assessment, analysis for markers of lipid peroxidation, and sebumeter analysis were completed. Another Unites States (US)/German study enrolled 40 subjects who were on topical prescription acne medications to which silymarin antioxidant serum was added. Acne lesion counts, tolerability, and facial appearance assessments were conducted in this study. RESULTS: The Brazilian study demonstrated a 45% reduction in inflammatory lesions and a 43% reduction in noninflammatory lesions after 12 weeks of silymarin antioxidant serum use. In addition, sebumeter testing showed a 16% reduction in oiliness at week 1. The US/German study showed the benefits of the serum in persons already on prescription acne therapy by reducing facial erythema by 60%, dryness by 49%, and scaling by 67%. CONCLUSION: Silymarin is shown in clinical testing to have significant benefits in reducing lipid peroxidation, oiliness, and PIH, and in improving key markers of skin aging. Additionally, the serum can be used alone or as an adjunctive treatment in acne therapy to further benefit aging, acne-prone skin.

      "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) presents a substantial mortality and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. While antiviral therapy (AVT) is the standard, complete HBV clearance remains elusive and may not reduce the risk of death in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Silymarin, a centuries-old herbal remedy, has shown promise against HBV infection and as an antifibrosis therapy. This study explores the potential of silymarin combined with AVT to reduce mortality and HCC incidence in patients with HBV-LC. This research, spanning from 2001 to 2019, entailed a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study which included 8447 HBV-LC patients all undergoing AVT. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study comprised two cohorts: a case cohort receiving silymarin alongside AVT for at least 30 days, and a control cohort on AVT alone. Propensity score matching, based on baseline parameters including HBV-DNA levels, comorbidity, and an important LC medication, namely, non-selective β-blockers, was employed to ensure balanced groups, resulting in 319 patients in each cohort for subsequent analyses. Overall mortality was the primary outcome, with HCC occurrence as a secondary outcome. Among 319 patients in both cohorts, the case cohort exhibited significant improvements in the international normalized ratio (INR), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) one year after the index date. A competing risk survival analysis demonstrated superior one-year and two-year mortality outcomes in the case cohort. However, no significant impact on one-year and two-year HCC occurrence was observed in either cohort. The combination of silymarin and AVT in HBV-LC patients demonstrated a synergistic effect, leading to decreased overall mortality and an improved comorbidity index. While the incidence of HCC remained unchanged, our results suggested promising potential for further clinical trials investigating the synergistic role of silymarin in the treatment of HBV-LC.",

      "abstract": "Three-dimensional liver bioprinting is an emerging technology in the field of regenerative medicine that aids in the creation of functional tissue constructs that can be used as transplantable organ substitutes. During transplantation, the bioprinted donor liver must be protected from the oxidative stress environment created by various factors during the transplantation procedure, as well as from drug-induced damage from medications taken as part of the post-surgery medication regimen following the procedure. In this study, Silymarin, a flavonoid with the hepatoprotective properties were introduced into the GelMA bioink formulation to protect the bioprinted liver against hepatotoxicity. The concentration of silymarin to be added in GelMA was optimised, bioink properties were evaluated, and HepG2 cells were used to bioprint liver tissue. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was used to induce hepatotoxicity in bioprinted liver, and the effect of this chemical on the metabolic activities of HepG2 cells was studied. The results showed that Silymarin helps with albumin synthesis and shields liver tissue from the damaging effects of CCl4. According to gene expression analysis, CCl4 treatment increased TNF-α and the antioxidant enzyme SOD expression in HepG2 cells while the presence of silymarin protected the bioprinted construct from CCl4-induced damage. Thus, the outcomes demonstrate that the addition of silymarin in GelMA formulation protects liver function in toxic environments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatty liver disease comprises a wide range of related liver disorders affecting mainly people who drink no or minimal amounts of alcohol. Silymarin is a member of the Carduus marianum family that has been used for centuries to treat different diseases. There is little evidence supporting its efficacy in humans. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of Silymarin in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). METHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for relevant clinical trials assessing the use of silymarin in patients with NAFLD. A risk of bias assessment was performed using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. We included the following outcomes: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (mg/dL), degree of fibrosis resolution, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and HOMA-IR. We analyzed continuous data using mean difference (MD) and relative 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We included nine clinical trials. We found that silymarin significantly reduced the levels of ALT (MD= -17.12 [-28.81, -4.43]), (P < 0.004), AST (MD= -12.56 [-19.02, -6.10]), (P < 0.0001) and TG (MD = -22.60 [-23.83, -21.38]) (p < 0.00001). It also improved HDL (MD= 2.13 [1.60, 2.66]), (P < 0.01)). There was no significant difference regarding GGT (P=o.07), TC (P= 0.52), LDL (P= 0.06), HOMA-IR (P= 0.06) and BMI (p=0.1).One study reported significant improvement in the degree of fibrosis (P = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Silymarin treatment significantly reduces biochemical and transaminase levels in patients with MASLD."

Meanwhile, Aflatoxins are mycotoxins with extraordinary potency that pose major health risks to several animal species. Additionally, it has been documented that aflatoxins harm the reproductive systems of a variety of domestic animals. The present design aimed to investigate the impact of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) on rat body weight and reproductive organs and the ameliorative effects of camel milk and silymarin through measured serum testosterone, testes pathology, and gene expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in the testes. A total of sixty mature male Wister white rats, each weighing an average of 83.67 ± 0.21 g, were used. There were six groups created from the rats. Each division had ten rats. The groups were the control (without any treatment), CM (1 ml of camel milk/kg body weight orally), S (20 mg silymarin/kg b. wt. suspension, orally), A (1.4 mg aflatoxin/kg diet), ACM (aflatoxin plus camel milk), and AS (aflatoxin plus silymarin). RESULTS: The results indicated the positive effects of camel milk and silymarin on growth, reproductive organs, and gene expression of TNF-α, LHR, and StAR with normal testicular architecture. Also, the negative effect of AFB1 on the rat's body weight and reproductive organs, as indicated by low body weight and testosterone concentration, was confirmed by the results of histopathology and gene expression. However, these negative effects were ameliorated by the ingestion of camel milk and silymarin. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, camel milk and silymarin could mitigate the negative effect of AFB1 on rat body weight and reproductive organs.",

A total of 384 (Hy-Line brown, 28-week-old) laying hens were randomly distributed into one of four dietary treatment groups (eight replication per treatment; 12 hens per replicate) for a 12-week long feeding trial. Hens were fed a basal diet with the addition of 0%, 0.02%, 0.04%, and 0.06% of MS respectively. The results expressed that egg production percentage and egg weight were linearly (p < 0.05) enhanced at Weeks 0-6, 7-12, and 0-12, when 0%, 0.02%, 0.04%, and 0.06% of MS were added to laying hen diets. The feed conversion ratio and feed intake improved (p < 0.05) linearly at Weeks 0-6, 7-12, and 0-12 with increasing levels of MS supplementation in laying hens. The eggshell thickness and eggshell strength were linearly (p < 0.05) improved at weeks 4, 8, and 12 with an MS-supplemented diet. Additionally, eggshell colour, Haugh unit, and albumin height had no significant (p > 0.05) difference throughout the experimental period with different levels of MS-supplemented diet. The yolk colour of eggs showed significant (p < 0.05) differences at weeks 8 and 12 with levels of the MS-supplemented diet. However, at the end of the trial, the blood profile indicated that cholesterol levels decreased (p < 0.05) linearly, and triglyceride levels showed a tendency to decrease (p < 0.10) with MS supplementation. In conclusion, increasing the level of MS addition in the laying hen diet improved the egg production percentage and egg quality, reducing cholesterol levels in Hy-Line brown hens. However, this study indicates that MS can be added to the diet of laying hens up to 0.06% for improved egg production and egg quality.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Data on the pharmacological treatment of gambling disorder are limited. Silymarin (derived from milk thistle) has antioxidant properties. The goal of the current study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of silymarin in adults with gambling disorder. METHODS: Forty-three individuals (18 [41.9%] women; mean age=49.61 [±13.1] years) with gambling disorder entered an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Dosing of silymarin ranged from 150 to 300 mg twice a day. The primary outcome measure was the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling (PG-YBOCS). Secondary outcome measures comprised the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale and measures of depression and anxiety. Outcomes were examined using mixed-effect models. RESULTS: Silymarin did not statistically differentiate from the placebo on any of the outcome measures of interest, in terms of treatment group×time interactions. There was a robust response in the placebo group (57% reduction on the PG-YBOCS), and on average there was a 56% reduction in YBOCS score for the milk thistle. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study do not support the use of silymarin/milk thistle in the treatment of gambling disorder but highlight the large placebo response seen in gambling disorder. Treatment interventions for gambling disorder need to better understand and address the placebo response. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02337634.",

      "abstract": "Atrazine is a widely applied herbicide to improve crop yield and maintain general health. It has been reported to impair thyroid function and architecture in experimental animals. Alterations in thyroid hormones disrupt normal body function and metabolism. Silymarin, a hepatoprotective flavonolignan, was found to improve thyroid function and body metabolism. Additionally, garlic displays several protective effects on body organs. Therefore, this study explored the prophylactic impact of natural compounds comprising silymarin and garlic extract on disrupted thyroid function, hepatic iodothyronine deiodinase type 1, and metabolic parameters in atrazine-intoxicated male rats. We found that daily pre- and co-treatment of atrazine-intoxicated male rats with silymarin (100 mg/kg, p.o) and/or garlic extract (10 mg/kg, p.o) significantly improved thyroid activation and hepatic functionality as evidenced by the re-establishment of T3, T3/T4, and TSH values as well as ALT and AST activities. Interestingly, individual or concurrent supplementation of the atrazine group with silymarin and garlic extract prevented the down-regulation in hepatic iodothyronine deiodinase type 1. These effects were coupled with the repletion of serum and hepatic antioxidants and the amelioration of lipid peroxidation. In addition, current natural products markedly alleviated weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Notably, a cocktail of silymarin and garlic extract exerted superior protection against atrazine-triggered deterioration of thyroid, hepatic, and metabolic functioning to individual treatments. Present findings pinpoint the prophylactic and synergistic influence of silymarin and garlic extract combinatorial regimen on thyroid activation and body metabolism via enhancing antioxidant potential, maintaining hepatic function, and iodothyronine deiodinase type 1.",

      "abstract": "Improving productive performance is a daily challenge in the poultry industry. Developing cost-effective additives and strategies that improve performance in antibiotic-free poultry production is critical to maintaining productivity and efficiency. This study evaluates the influence of a commercially available phytogenic feed additive (CA-PFA, that comprises silymarin, betaine and curcumin extracts as main ingredients) and silymarin on commercial broilers' productive performance and liver function with and without carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, with six treatments, eight replicates, and eight birds per replicate in 18 one-day-old male broilers (Cobb Vantress 500) each; under a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement (3 diets x 2 levels of CCl4, 0 and 1 mL/kg body weight orally). The experimental treatments included 3 diets, commercially recommended doses of CA-PFA (500 mg/kg of feed; this dose provides 70 mg/kg of silymarin, besides the other active ingredients included in the formulation), silymarin (250 mg/kg of feed, containing 28% of active ingredient; this dose provides 70 mg/kg of silymarin as active ingredient) and an additive-free basal diet as a control. A standard commercial silymarin was used as a reference due to its well-known and extensively studied hepatoprotective properties that can mitigate the negative effects of CCl4 in the liver. The data were analyzed as a 2-way ANOVA, and the means showing significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences were then compared using the Post-Hoc Tukey HSD test. No interaction was detected between factors. Exposure to CCl4 had a noticeable detrimental effect on alertness, productive performance, and liver function of broilers without a significant increase in mortality. Including CA-PFA in the diet improved productive performance compared to the basal diet from day 21 to the end of the trial, on day 42. While no influence in feed intake was detected for any treatment, CA-PFA improved body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) significantly (P < 0.05) from day 21 to the end of the trial in healthy and CCl4-exposed birds. The results show that CA-PFA supplementation improves performance parameters in broilers with and without CCl4-induced liver damage, when compared to a basal diet and the addition of a standard commercial silymarin product.",

Obesity and IR are the main risk factors for developing T2DM and other metabolic disorders. Today, there is a need for new strategies to target IR in patients with these metabolic diseases. In the present longitudinal study, a group of non-diabetic insulin-resistant women with type 1 and type 2 obesity were given silymarin for 12 weeks, with no change in habitual diet and physical activity. We used the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR) to determine IR at baseline and after silymarin treatment (t = 12 weeks). We obtained five timepoint oral glucose tolerance tests, and other biochemical and clinical parameters were analyzed before and after treatment. Treatment with silymarin alone significantly reduced mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HOMA-IR levels at 12 weeks compared to baseline values (p < 0.05). Mean fasting plasma insulin (FPI), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (Tg), indirect bilirubin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased compared to baseline values, although changes were non-significant. The overall results suggest that silymarin may offer a therapeutic alternative to improve IR in non-diabetic individuals with obesity. Further clinical trials are needed in this type of patient to strengthen the results of this study.",

Burn injuries are recognized as challenging, critical wounds. Especially in third-degree burns, treatment is demanding due to extended wounds, irregular shapes, significant exudation, and intense pain during dressing changes. In this work, hydrogels made of zwitterionic chitosan and dialdehyde starch (ZCS and ZDAS) were created to deliver silymarine (SM) and levofloxacin (LEV). The hydrogels were effortlessly produced using dynamic Schiff base linkages and ionic interactions between ZCS and ZDAS at appropriate times. The pore uniformity, gel fraction, and commendable swelling properties can imply a suitable degree of Schiff base cross-link. The hydrogel demonstrated outstanding shape retention, and significant self-healing and flexibility abilities, enabling it to uphold its form even during bodily movements. After injecting biocompatible hydrogel on the wound, a notable acceleration in wound closure was observed on day 21 (98.1 ± 1.10 %) compared to the control group (75.1 ± 6.13 %), and histopathological analysis revealed a reduction of inflammation that can be linked to remarkable antioxidant and antibiotic properties. The results demonstrate the hydrogel's efficacy in promoting burn wound healing, making it a promising candidate for medical applications.",

We, therefore, aimed to examine the existing evidence on the effect of Silymarin consumption on inflammation and oxidative stress factors by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: A systematic literature search up to September 2023 was completed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify eligible RCTs. Heterogeneity tests of the selected trials were performed using the I2 statistic. Random effects models were assessed based on the heterogeneity tests, and pooled data were determined as weighted mean differences with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Our findings showed that Silymarin consumption significantly decreased CRP (WMD, - 0.50 mg/L; 95% CI, (- 0.95 to - 0.04); p = 0.03), MDA (WMD, - 1.19 nmol/mL; 95% CI, (- 1.99 to - 0.38); p = 0.004), and IL-6 (WMD, - 0.44 pg/ml; 95% CI, (- 0.75 to - 0.12); p = 0.006). Silymarin consumption had no significant effects on IL-10, TAC, and GSH. A significant non-linear relationship was observed between the duration of the intervention and MDA changes. CONCLUSIONS: Silymarin can help reduce inflammation in patients with diabetes and thalassemia by reducing MDA as an oxidative stress marker and CRP and IL-6 as inflammatory markers.",

Non-small cell lung cancer cells were cultured and divided into groups and treated with drugs, and A blank control group was set up. The concentration of silymarin in the experimental group was 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 40 mg/L, respectively, which were recorded as groups A, B and C, and three repeated experiments were performed in each group. Absorbance (A value), survival rate and number of invasions were measured at 490 nm 24 h and 48 h after treatment, and the protein expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, p-p38, p-JNK and p-ERK 1/2 of cells in each group were detected. There were differences in the A value (control group > Group A > Group B > Group C), cell survival rate (control group < group A < group B < group C) and the number of cell invasions (control group > Group A > Group B > group C) at 24h and 48h among all groups (P<0.05). After 24h of administration, the mRNA expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, P-P38 and P-JNK protein expression were significantly different among groups, and the control group was > group A > Group B > group C (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in protein expression levels of p38, JNK, ERK 1/2 and P-ERK 1/2 among all groups (P>0.05). Silymarin may inhibit the proliferation and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer cells by inhibiting the activity of MAPK pathway, and the higher the concentration, the more obvious the inhibition effect, which provides a basis for further research and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of silymarin on biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and disease severity in Alzheimer's patients. METHODS: This randomized, single-blind clinical trial study was performed on 33 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) whose disease was confirmed by DSM-5 criteria and by brain imaging. Patients in the case group received three 250 mg silymarin capsules daily (each containing 150 mg silymarin), as an adjunctive medication in addition to the routine medication regimen. In the placebo group (control), patients received the same amount of placebo. All patients underwent Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and a panel of blood tests including malondialdehyde, neopterin, catalase, paraoxonase-1, total oxidative status, and total antioxidant capacity to reevaluate the changes pre/postintervention at the end of the trimester. RESULTS: The catalase and MDA serum levels after the adjunctive silymarin treatment decreased significantly (Catalasebefore silymarin = 9.29 ± 7.02 vs Catalaseafter silymarin = 5.32 ± 2.97, p = 0.007 and MDAbefore silymarin = 4.29 ± 1.90 vs MDAafter silymarin = 1.66 ± 0.84, p < 0.001) while MMSE increased notably (MMSEbefore silymarin = 10.39 ± 6.42 vs MMSEafter silymarin = 13.37 ± 6.81, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Silymarin can be effective as an adjunct drug and a powerful antioxidant in reducing oxidative stress and improving the course of AD.",

      "abstract": "Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a significant global health concern and generally leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Various factors, such as metabolic abnormalities, viral infections, alcoholism, genetics and autoimmune responses, contribute to liver damage. CLD is characterized by different phenotypes, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, drug-induced liver injury and alcoholic liver disease. These conditions have seen an increase in comorbidities and hospitalizations over the past decade, imposing a substantial burden on patients and healthcare systems. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of liver injury is crucial for effective management and reducing the clinical and economic burden of CLD. Although several attempts have been evaluated to find a drug therapy option for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, there is no effective drug approved to date. However, different studies have demonstrated that silymarin, the milk thistle extract, could exert hepatoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties and should therefore be considered an efficacious, tolerable and promising herbal product for the management of liver activity in CLDs. This review discusses the clinical features, diagnosis and available treatments for major liver diseases, acting as an introduction to a clinical case collection based on the management and treatment of major liver diseases with silymarin. This article is part of the Current clinical use of silymarin in the treatment of toxic liver diseases: a case series Special Issue: https://www.drugsincontext.com/special_issues/current-clinical-use-of-silymarin-in-the-treatment-of-toxic-liver-diseases-a-case-series."

LRP1 is involved in both central clearance of Aβ from the CNS and transport of Aβ toward peripheral organs. In this study, the effect of silymarin combination compared to rosuvastatin and placebo on neuro-metabolites and serum levels of LRP1 and Aβ1-42 proteins and oxidative stress enzymes and lipid and cognitive tests of Iranian AD patients. METHODS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled study, thirty-six mild AD patients were divided into groups (n=12) of silymarin 140mg, placebo, and rosuvastatin 10mg. Medications were administered 3 times a day for 6 months. Clinical tests, lipid profile (TG, HDL, TC, and LDL), Aβ1-42, and LRP1 markers were measured at the beginning and end of the intervention. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure metabolites. Using SPSS software a one-way ANOVA test was used to compare the means of the quantitative variables and Pearson and Spearman's correlations to measure the correlation. GraphPad Prism software was used for drawing graphs. P < 0.05 was considered a significant. RESULTS: The levels of LRP1 and Aβ1-42 in the silymarin group were significantly increased compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). NAA/mI in the silymarin group had a significant increase compared to both placebo and rosuvastatin groups (P < 0.05). Right and left hippocampal mI/Cr directly correlated with TG (r = 0.603, P = 0.003 and r = 0.595, P = 0.004, respectively). NAA/Cr of the right and left hippocampus was inversely related to TG (r = -0.511, P = 0.0033, and r = -0.532, P = 0.0021, respectively). NAA/Cr and NAA/mI of bilateral hippocampi directly correlated with HDL (P < 0.05). An inverse correlation was observed between the Aβ1-42 and mI/Cr of the right and left hippocampus (r = -0.661, P = 0.000 and r = -0.638, P = 0.000, respectively). CONCLUSION: Donepezil and silymarin improved lipid profile associated with increased NAA/Cr, and decreased mI/Cr, in AD patients. Biomarker NAA/mI can be clinically significant in examining AD pathology. Measurement of the lipid factors and neurometabolites can be a suitable method for monitoring this disease."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Liver dysfunction is one of the most common disorders in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In recent studies, silymarin has been observed to have hepatic protective effects. Therefore, in this study, the effect of oral silymarin on the hepatic functions of patients with ALL was investigated. Methods: In the present double-blind clinical trial study, 121 patients with ALL over 5 years of age were divided into two groups after obtaining informed consent. The subjects were randomly divided into a silymarin-treatment group and a placebo group. In the silymarin-treatment group, patients received 70 mg oral capsules of silymarin twice daily or syrup of silymarin three times a day (each 5 ml of syrup contains 50 mg of silymarin). Patients were examined once a month for 9 months to receive capsules and measure the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, albumin, and cholesterol. Results: Comparison of changes before and after treatment in the two groups showed that receiving oral silymarin resulted in a slight significant decrease in the levels of ALT, AST, GGT, and bilirubin (p < 0.05), but had no effect on ALP, albumin, and cholesterol (p > 0.05). Discussion: The results of the present study showed that in pediatric patients with ALL, silymarin intake improves liver function. The very strong antioxidant effect of silymarin may explain its protective effect on the liver. Clinical Trial Registration: IRCT20150119020715N10."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a particularly dangerous and severe kind of liver cancer. Many anticancer drugs fail to complete the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma without any side effects. There should be appropriate and without side effective treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to evaluate how quercetin and silymarin in a niosomal formulation affected hepatocyte carcinoma caused by diethylnitrosamine. METHODS: Five groups were created from the thirty male rats. Normal control (untreated group), tumor group (administered dimethylnitrosoamine 200 mg/kg), treatment group I (administered 50 mg/kg of niosomal encapsulated quercetin), treatment group II (administered 50 mg/kg of niosomal encapsulated silymarin), and treatment group III (administered 50 mg/kg of niosomal encapsulated quercetin + silymarin). Then, biochemical estimation, serum analysis, and histopathological examination were carried out. RESULTS: Treatment group III, treated with niosomal encapsulation of a combination of quercetin + silymarin 50 mg/kg, demonstrated the significant restoration of alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen and also antioxidants like superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide. The histopathological examination showed improved liver architecture in this group compared to other treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that a potent anticancer effect was observed in treatment group III as niosomal formulation increased the bioavailability of the drug within the body. In order to completely understand the underlying processes and evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of these chemicals in the therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma, further investigation and clinical trials are required.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological cancers among women worldwide. Cisplatin (Cis) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent used to treat several types of cancer. Silymarin (SLM) is an extract of medicinal plant Silybum marianum (milk thistle) with anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenesis, antioxidant, and anticancer properties used alone or in combination with other drugs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of co-treatment with SLM and Cis on A2780 human ovarian cancer cell lines. METHODS: In this study, A2780 cells were treated with various concentrations of SLM and Cis, separately and in combination. Cell cytotoxicity, scratch, clonogenic, and flow-cytometry assays were accomplished to estimate cell viability, migration, colony formation, and apoptosis, respectively. Real-time PCR was utilized to determine the expression levels of miR-155 and miR-27a. RESULTS: SLM significantly reduced the proliferation of A2780 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Combination treatment with SLM and Cis was more potent than either single treatment in reducing viability, suppressing migration, inhibiting colony formation, and promoting the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, gene expression analysis revealed a significant decline in the expression levels of miR-155 and miR-27a in response to all separate and combined treatments, and co-treatment was more effective than individual treatments in altering miRNAs expression. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, SLM boosts the anticancer activity of Cis and mitigates its side effects. Thus, the co-treatment of SLM and Cis can be proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Silymarin, a widely-used hepatoprotective agent, has shown antitumor properties in both in vitro and animal studies. Currently, there is limited knowledge regarding silymarin's antitelomerase effects on human colorectal cancer and hepatocyte carcinoma cells. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative and antitelomerase effects of silymarin on four human colorectal cancer and HepG2 hepatocyte carcinoma cell lines. The cell viability and telomerase activity were assessed using MTT and the telomerase repeat amplification protocol assay, respectively. We also investigated the effects of silymarin on the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase and its promoter methylation in HepG2 cells by real-time RT-PCR and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. Silymarin treatment inhibited cell proliferation and telomerase activity in all cancer cells. After 24 h of treatment, silymarin exhibited IC50 values ranging from 19 - 56.3 µg/mL against these cancer cells. A 30-min treatment with silymarin at the IC50 concentration effectively inhibited telomerase activity in cell-free extracts of both colorectal cancer and hepatocyte carcinoma cells. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 10 and 30 µg/mL of silymarin for 48 h resulted in a decrease in human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression to 75 and 35% of the level observed in the untreated control (p < 0.01), respectively. Treatment with silymarin (10, 30, and 60 µg/mL) for 48 h did not affect human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter methylation in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that silymarin inhibits cancer cell growth by directly inhibiting telomerase activity and downregulating its human telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit. However, silymarin did not affect human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter methylation at the concentrations of 10 - 60 µg/mL used in this study.",

So, in the present study, SL solid dispersions (SDs) were developed using different carriers like Kollidone VA64 (KL), Soluplus (SP), and Poloxamer 188 (PL) by solvent evaporation (SE), microwave irradiation (MI), and freeze-drying (FD) methods. The phase solubility and saturation solubility studies were assessed to estimate the stability constant as well as the carrier effect. The dissolution studies were performed for prepared SL-SDs (binary and ternary) to select the optimum SL-SDs. The selected SL-SDs (F5, F9) were further characterized for infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Finally, the comparative cell viability assay (lung cancer cell line) was performed to evaluate the change in activity after the formulation of SDs. The phase solubility and solubility study results displayed marked enhancements in solubility. The dissolution study findings showed significant enhancement in drug release from ternary solid dispersions (F7-F9) > ternary physical mixture (PM3) > binary solid dispersions (F1-F6) > binary physical mixture (PM1, PM2) in comparison to free SL. A greater release was observed from ternary SDs due to the addition of PL in the formulation, which had a synergistic effect on increasing the solubility. IR and NMR spectra revealed no chemical interaction between SL, KL, and PL. DSC, XRD, and SEM all confirmed the transformation of crystalline SL into amorphous SL. The cell viability assay demonstrated significantly enhanced results from ternary solid dispersion (F9) compared to free SL. Based on the study results, it can be said that SL-SDs are an alternative way to deliver drugs orally that can improve solubility and have anti-cancer activity."

      "abstract": "Combination therapy represents a promising strategy in cancer management by reducing chemotherapy resistance and associated side effects. Silymarin (SLM) has been extensively investigated due to its potent antioxidant properties and demonstrated efficacy against cancer cells. Under certain conditions however, polyphenolic compounds may also exhibit prooxidant activity by elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can harm the target cells. In this study, we hypothesized that the simultaneous administration of iron (Fe) could alter the antioxidant characteristic of SLM nanoliposomes (SLM Lip) to a prooxidant state. Hence, we first developed a SLM Lip preparation using lipid film method, and then investigated the anti-oxidant properties as well as the cytotoxicity of the liposomal preparation. We also explored the efficacy of concomitant administration of iron sucrose and SML Lip on the tumor growth and survival of mice bearing tumors. We observed that exposing cells to iron, and consecutive treatment with SLM Lip (Fe + SLM Lip) could induce greater toxicity to 4 T1 breast cancer cells compared to SLM Lip. Further, Fe + SLM Lip combination demonstrated a time-dependent effect on reducing the catalase activity compared to SLM Lip, while iron treatment did not alter cell toxicity and catalase activity. In a mouse breast cancer model, the therapeutic efficacy of Fe + SLM Lip was superior compared to SLM Lip, and the treated animals survived longer. The histopathological findings did not reveal a significant damage to the major organs, whereas the most significant tumor necrosis was evident with Fe + SLM Lip treatment. The outcomes of the present investigation unequivocally underscored the prospective use of Fe + SLM combination in the context of cancer therapy, which warrants further scrutiny."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present research aimed to study the possible protective effects of Silymarin on testicular I/R injury in a rat model evaluated through histopathology and biochemical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research investigated the impact of Silymarin on IR damage in male Wistar albino rats. Animals were divided into three groups: group 1 (sham), group 2 (IR), and group 3 (IR+Silymarin). RESULTS: There were no notable differences in the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and glutathione (GSH) across the three groups (p=0.260, p=0.486 and p=0.803, respectively). Contrarily, the total antioxidant status (TAS) levels exhibited significant variations between groups (p=0.001). The total oxidant status (TOS) levels also differed significantly between groups (p=0.004). The tissue evaluations uncovered substantial differences in the Johnson score, which is used to gauge testicular damage. A distinct contrast was seen between Group 1 and Group 2, and also between Group 2 and Group 3, with an all-encompassing p-value lower than 0.01. The same significant disparities were found for the percentages of Bax and Annexin V immunostaining (p<0.01 for each), reflecting the inflammation and apoptosis brought about by ischemia-reperfusion and the protective effects of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of the current investigation showed that Silymarin could be a valuable agent for reducing testicular tissue damage following I/R injury.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The co-morbidity of DMOB has become increasingly problematic among the world's population because of a high-calorie diet and sedentary lifestyle. DMOB is associated with lower testosterone (TN) levels, the male sex hormone. The phytochemical compound silymarin (SN) exerts antidiabetic activity by modifying β-cells and anti-obesity activity by inhibiting adipogenesis by methylxanthine. AIM: The goal of this study was to find out how well testosterone (TN) with silymarin (SN) protects against oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver of the experimental rats with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (DMOB). OBJECTIVES: The present study evaluates the efficacy of TN and SN combination (TNSN) on the levels of the potential parameters, such as body mass, serum marker enzymes, fasting glucose levels, HbA1c levels, lipid profile, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, proinflammatory cytokines, gene expression pathways, and histopathology in a DMOB comorbidity rat model. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks with an administration of a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) i.p. injection (30 mg/kg) on the 9th week of the study. The procedure was to develop the DMOB co-morbidity model in the experimental animals. Co-treatment of TN and SN administration were followed throughout the experiment. Rats were sacrificed after overnight fasting to collect serum and liver tissue samples. Samples were analyzed using a clinical chemistry automated analyzer, spectrophotometry, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods and protocols. RESULTS: Analyses of body mass changes, serum marker enzymes, fasting glucose levels, HbA1c levels, lipid profiles, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, TNF-α, IL-6, adiponectin, CYP7A1, ACC expression pathways, and histopathology showed significant abnormal levels (P ≤ 0.05) in the pathological group. These were efficiently treated to normal by the administration of TNSN. CONCLUSION: These results concluded that TNSN exerted protective efficacy against the liver abnormalities in the co-morbidity of the DMOB rat model.",

Silymarin owns special characteristics that qualify it as a possible treatment for acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of silymarin cream as a new therapeutic option against salicylic acid peels in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. METHODS: A split-face, comparative, Quasi-experimental clinical trial included 30 patients with acne vulgaris. Salicylic acid 30% peels were applied as an office procedure to one half of the face every 2 weeks for 3 months. Topical silymarin 1.4% cream was prescribed as a home treatment, twice daily, to the other half of the face for 3 months. The results were evaluated using the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS), photographic evaluation, and patient self-assessment scale. The adverse effects during treatment were recorded. The sample size was calculated by Stata/IC 16.1. RESULTS: After treatment, a significant reduction of GAGS was noted on both sides of the face, with an insignificant difference between both treatments. The comparative photographic evaluation and patient self-assessment scale were also insignificant. Hyperpigmentation was recorded in 2 cases on the salicylic acid-treated side. No side effects for silymarin cream were observed. CONCLUSION: Topical silymarin cream 1.4% showed comparable results to Salicylic acid 30% peels. It can be considered a promising safe treatment modality for mild to moderate acne vulgaris.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although radiotherapy is one of the main cancer treatment modalities, exposing healthy organs/tissues to ionizing radiation during treatment and tumor resistance to ionizing radiation are the chief challenges of radiotherapy that can lead to different adverse effects. It was shown that the combined treatment of radiotherapy and natural bioactive compounds (such as silymarin/silibinin) can alleviate the ionizing radiation-induced adverse side effects and induce synergies between these therapeutic modalities. In the present review, the potential radiosensitization effects of silymarin/silibinin during cancer radiation exposure/radiotherapy were studied. METHODS: According to the PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was performed for the identification of relevant studies in different electronic databases of Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to October 2022. We screened 843 articles in accordance with a predefined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven studies were finally included in this systematic review. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the cell survival/proliferation of cancer cells treated with ionizing radiation was considerably less, and silymarin/silibinin administration synergistically increased ionizing radiation-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the tumor volume, weight, and growth of ionizing radiation-treated mice as compared to the untreated groups, and these diminutions were predominant in those treated with radiotherapy plus silymarin/ silibinin. Furthermore, the irradiation led to a set of biochemical and histopathological changes in tumoral cells/tissues, and the ionizing radiation-induced alterations were synergized following silymarin/silibinin administration (in most cases). CONCLUSION: In most cases, silymarin/silibinin administration could sensitize the cancer cells to ionizing radiation through an increase of free radical formation, induction of DNA damage, increase of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis, etc. However, suggesting the use of silymarin/silibinin during radiotherapeutic treatment of cancer patients requires further clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and silymarin (SIL) in the liver of mice exposed to ethanol and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Mice were divided into four groups (n = 6): naive, vehicle, NAC (200 mg/kg), and SIL (200 mg/kg). Treatments were given orally (po) once daily for 10 days. Liver injury was induced by administration of ethanol (30%, po) for 10 days, once daily, followed by a single administration of LPS (2 mg/kg, ip) 24 h before euthanasia. After the treatment period, animals were euthanized, and liver and blood samples were collected. NAC, but not SIL, prevented the increase in oxalacetic glutamic transaminase (OGT) and pyruvic glutamic transaminase (PGT) serum levels. NAC and SIL did not restore levels of reduced glutathione or hepatic malonaldehyde. The treatments with NAC or SIL showed no difference in the activity of glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase compared to vehicle group. Myeloperoxidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities are increased, as well as the IL-6 and IL-10 levels in the liver. The treatment with NAC, but not SIL, reduced the N-acetylglucosamines activity and the IL-6 and IL-10 amount in the liver. Histological findings revealed microsteatosis in the vehicle group, which was not prevented by SIL but was partially reduced in animals receiving NAC. Unlike other liver injury models, NAC (200 mg/kg) or SIL (200 mg/kg) did not positively affect antioxidant patterns in liver tissue of animals exposed to ethanol plus LPS, but NAC treatment displays anti-inflammatory properties in this model.",

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of silymarin against 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity in male mice. Six-week-old mice received subacute doses of 3-NP intraperitoneally for 17 days. Mice were given silymarin (70 mg/kg/day, P.O.) for 2 weeks before 3-NP administration or for 4 weeks after 3-NP administration. At the end of the treatment schedule, animals were evaluated for behavioral alterations. Subsequently, neuronal damage in the hippocampus region of the brain tissues, oxidative stress-related parameters (lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and total antioxidant capacity), and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-1β) levels were evaluated. Our results indicated that 3-NP treatment significantly (p < 0.05) tended to reduce motor coordination, memory, and neuronal antioxidant status while increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. However, silymarin in both treatment and pretreatment protocols markedly (p < 0.05) attenuated the behavioral deficits, oxidative stress status, and neuroinflammation. The results of the current study suggest that the neuroprotective effect of silymarin against 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity might be due to the mitigation of oxidative stress status and provide insight into the therapeutic potential of silymarin.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to cadmium has been related to liver and kidney diseases such as polycystic and nephrotic syndrome. It is still unclear how cadmium contributes to these diseases. It is believed that the induction of oxidative stress resulting from the inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities and changes in drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver could explain the role of cadmium in the development of different diseases in the kidney and probably other organs. Changes in oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes, and drug-metabolizing enzyme activities were assessed in the liver of male rats exposed to cadmium chloride. Additionally, the protective effects of silymarin and garlic extract against cadmium toxicosis were evaluated. Rats were randomly divided into eight groups as follows, groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, received orally saline, CdCl2 (1 mg/kg), garlic extract [800 mg/kg], silymarin (25 mg/kg) and silymarin plus garlic extract respectively for 28 consecutive days. Rats in groups 6, 7, and 8 were pretreated with the same doses of garlic, silymarin, and garlic plus silymarin, respectively for two hours before cadmium administration. The Western immunoblotting technique was used to investigate the protein expression of cytochrome P450 isozymes. Spectrophotometric methods were used to assess the activity of both antioxidant- and drug-metabolizing enzymes. Free radical levels [measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)], catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities increased whereas the levels of glutathione and the activities of glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and glutamyl transferase, cytochrome P450, aryl hydrocarbon dehydrogenase (AHH), dimethylnitrosamine-N-demethylase I (DMN-dI), 7-ethoxycoumarine-O-deethylase (ECOD), cytochrome b5 and NADPH-Cytochrome-c-reductase enzyme activities decreased after cadmium treatment. Furthermore, Western immunoblotting data revealed that glutathione peroxidase protein expression increased following cadmium exposure, but cytochrome P450 2E1 and 3A4 expressions were downregulated. However, pretreatment of rats with silymarin or garlic extract or both before cadmium administration was found to restore the protein expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 and 3A4, the level of free radicals, antioxidant enzymes, drug-metabolizing enzyme activities to their normal levels. Similarly, histological studies revealed that silymarin and/or garlic extract reduced the liver damage caused by cadmium. Silymarin and/or garlic extract reduced the adverse effects of cadmium on the activity of both drug-metabolizing and antioxidant enzymes activity. These antioxidants could be provided to those who work in cadmium-based sectors to help them cope with the adverse effects of cadmium on their kidneys. In addition, Inhibiting drug-metabolizing enzyme activity should be considered when administering therapeutic medications to persons exposed to cadmium because most therapeutic drugs and many endogenous substances are largely metabolized by these enzymes.",

However, oxytetracycline is known to have immunosuppression impacts. We, therefore, evaluated the immunological, antioxidative, and histopathological status of Nile tilapia fed a diet containing silymarin (100 mg/kg fish feed) for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. The protective effects of silymarin against Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) infection and oxytetracycline treatment were evaluated. Blood parameters (erythrocyte count, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and packed cell volume) improved over time in fish fed on dietary silymarin. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were lower in fish fed on dietary silymarin, whereas serum levels of aspartate transferase (AST)and alkaline phosphatase (ALK) were unchanged. Dietary silymarin affected serum lipid profiles as decreases in serum triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a trend toward lower cholesterol levels, whereas serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased compared to fish fed on the control diet. Dietary silymarin resulted in an increase of serum total protein levels and globulin fractions. Significant and progressive increases in catalase and glutathione peroxidase levels were observed after six weeks of feeding on a dietary silymarin before decreasing to control levels at the end of the experimental period. Fish fed on dietary silymarin, interleukin-1 and fish tumor necrosis factor-alpha were upregulated in hepatic tissues; however, interleukin-10 levels decreased to comparable levels to controls after eight weeks. Fish infected with A. hydrophila displayed septicemia (opaque eye, hemorrhagic ulcers, dentated fins, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly). Reduced mortality was observed in Nile tilapia infected with A. hydrophila and fed a diet containing silymarin, indicating that silymarin improves fish responses to oxytetracycline with a 37% reduction in mortality.",

One hundred eighty rainbow trout were randomly assigned to four groups: control, diazinon exposed (0.1 mg L-1), silymarin supplemented (400 mg kg-1), and diazinon + silymarin. Blood samples and liver tissue were collected after 7, 14, and 21 days of exposure to analyze biochemical parameters and oxidative biomarkers. Diazinon exposure in fish resulted in liver damage, as indicated by increased antioxidant enzyme activities in the hepatocytes. Silymarin showed the potential to mitigate this damage by reducing oxidative stress and restoring enzyme activities. Nevertheless, diazinon increased creatine phosphokinase activity, which may not be normalized by silymarin. Exposure to diazinon increased glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, whereas total protein, albumin, and globulin levels were significantly decreased in fish. However, silymarin controlled and maintained these levels within the normal range. Diazinon increased creatinine, urea, uric acid, and ammonia contents. Silymarin could regulate creatinine, urea, and uric acid levels while having limited effectiveness on ammonia excretion. Furthermore, diazinon increased malondialdehyde in hepatocytes, whereas administration of silymarin could restore normal malondialdehyde levels. Overall, silymarin showed potential as a therapeutic treatment for mitigating oxidative damage induced by diazinon in fish, but its effectiveness on creatine phosphokinase, glutathione reductase, and ammonia may be limited."

Forty-eight Wister male rats (weight: 130 ± 10) were housed for 14 days and then divided randomly into six groups: control, SLY: rats received only silymarin orally for 12 weeks (daily), CO: rats were injected with corn oil for 8 weeks (3 times weekly), CCl4: rats were injected with CCl4 solubilized in corn oil for 8 weeks (day by day), Treated: rats received silymarin for 4 weeks after CCl4 injection, Protected: rats received silymarin for 4 weeks before and 8 weeks during CCl4 injection. When the treatment period for the rats was over, they underwent scarification after anesthesia. Then, the sera were extracted from the collected blood for the determination of irisin levels, liver functions, and lipid profiles. Liver tissues were separated for the histopathological examinations, the determination of oxidative stress (OS) parameters content, and the relative gene expression of inflammatory cytokines; nuclear factor kappa (NF)-κB, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). The findings showed that silymarin reduced liver inflammation by overcoming the OS process and inflammatory cytokines production which was stimulated by CCl4. These results were confirmed by histopathology of liver tissues.",
