      "abstract": "Aquafaba is the liquid that remains from the cooking of beans in the canning industry, generally discarded as wastewater. This research aimed to optimize ultrasound pretreatment to enhance this by-product and introduce it as a high-added value product (known as liquid gold) in the food industry. The results showed that with the increase in the sonication time and amplitude, the extraction efficiency, soluble protein content, the density, and dry matter content of black chickpeas aquafaba increased significantly (p < 0.05). The results also demonstrated that foaming ability (in short ultrasonication times) and foam stability significantly increased with higher amplitude. The results of numerical optimization showed that ultrasound pre-treatment for 30 min with an amplitude of 72 % on black chickpeas before the cooking process created the best conditions for aquafaba extraction. Under these optimized conditions, the results yielded the highest values so that extraction efficiency, protein content, density, dry matter, foaming ability, and foam stability were 212.07 %, 3546.7 mg/kg, 1.038 g/mL, 4.76 %, 243.57 %, and 44.50 % respectively. Thermogravimetric and FT-IR analysis showed that the pre-sonication process not only makes aquafaba thermally stable, but also does not cause any structural changes in its chemical components. According to the favorable physicochemical characteristics of aquafaba, this product can benefit the food industry. It can be a material with high added value, profitable for the canning industry."

      "abstract": "Chickpeas are more sustainable than other food systems and have high a nutritional value, especially regarding their vitamin composition. One of the main vitamins in chickpeas is vitamin B6, which is very important for several human metabolic functions. Since chickpeas are consumed after cooking, our goal was to better understand the role of leaching (diffusion) and thermal degradation of vitamin B6 in chickpeas during hydrothermal processing. Kinetics were conducted at four temperatures, ranging from 25 to 85 °C, carried out for 4 h in an excess of water for the diffusion kinetics, or in hermetic bags for the thermal degradation kinetics. Thermal degradation was modeled according to a first-order reaction, and diffusion was modeled according to a modified version of Fick's second law. Diffusivity constants varied from 4.76 × 10-14 m2/s at 25 °C to 2.07 × 10-10 m2/s at 85 °C; the temperature had an impact on both the diffusivity constant and the residual vitamin B6. The kinetic constant ranged from 9.35 × 10-6 at 25 °C to 54.9 × 10-6 s-1 at 85 °C, with a lower impact of the temperature. In conclusion, vitamin B6 is relatively stable to heat degradation; loss is mainly due to diffusion, especially during shorter treatment times."

      "abstract": "Chickpea is an economically and nutritionally important grain legume globally, however, cold stress has adverse effects on its growth. In cold countries, like Canada where the growing season is short, having cold stress-tolerant varieties is crucial. Crop wild relatives of chickpea, especially Cicer reticulatum, can survive in suboptimal environments and are an important resource for crop improvement. In this study, we explored the performance of eleven C. reticulatum wild accessions and two chickpea cultivars, CDC Leader and CDC Consul, together with a cold sensitive check ILC533 under freezing stress. Freezing tolerance was scored based on a 1-9 scale. The wild relatives, particularly Kesen_075 and CudiA_152, had higher frost tolerance compared to the cultivars, which all died after frost treatment. We completed transcriptome analysis via mRNA sequencing to assess changes in gene expression in response to freezing stress and identified 6,184 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CDC Consul, and 7,842 DEGs in Kesen_075. GO (gene ontology) analysis of the DEGs revealed that those related to stress responses, endogenous and external stimuli responses, secondary metabolite processes, and photosynthesis were significantly over-represented in CDC Consul, while genes related to endogenous stimulus responses and photosynthesis were significantly over-represented in Kesen_075. These results are consistent with Kesen_075 being more tolerant to freezing stress than CDC Consul. Moreover, our data revealed that the expression of CBF pathway-related genes was impacted during freezing conditions in Kesen_075, and expression of these genes is believed to alleviate the damage caused by freezing stress. We identified genomic regions associated with tolerance to freezing stress in an F2 population derived from a cross between CDC Consul and Kesen_075 using QTL-seq analysis. Eight QTLs (P<0.05) on chromosomes Ca3, Ca4, Ca6, Ca7, Ca8, and two QTLs (P<0.01) on chromosomes Ca4 and Ca8, were associated with tolerance to freezing stress. Interestingly, 58 DEGs co-located within these QTLs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the transcriptome and QTLs associated with freezing tolerance in wild relatives of chickpea under controlled conditions. Altogether, these findings provide comprehensive information that aids in understanding the molecular mechanism of chickpea adaptation to freezing stress and further provides functional candidate genes that can assist in breeding of freezing-stress tolerant varieties."

      "abstract": "Cicer arietinum or chickpea is an important and highly nutritious pulse, a source of complex carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, considered non-allergenic, and non-GMO crop. Processing technologies play an important role in modifying some chickpea properties and thus increasing its nutritional and health benefits. Herein is summarized and compared the available data on nutritional and functional aspects caused by thermal, nonthermal, and combinations of treatments for chickpea processing. The study focuses on describing the processing conditions necessary to change chickpea matrices aiming to enhance compound bioavailability, reduce anti-nutritional factors and modify functional characteristics for industrial application in product development. Thermal and nonthermal treatments can modify nutrient composition and bioavailability in chickpea matrices. Thermal treatments, moist or dry, prevent microbial spoilage, increase product palatability and increase protein quality. Nonthermal treatments aim to shorten the processing time and use less energy and water sources. Compared to thermal treatments, they usually preserve organoleptic attributes and bioactive compounds in chickpea matrices. Some treatment combinations can increase the efficacy of single treatments. Combined treatments increase antioxidant concentration, protein digestibility and available starch contents. Finally, despite differences among their effects, single and combined treatments can improve the nutritional and physicochemical properties of chickpea matrices.",

      "abstract": "To our knowledge, there is no study on the relationship between molecular spectral features and nutrient availability in chickpeas. The purpose of this study was to reveal molecular structure spectral profiles among cool-season adapted CDC chickpea varieties and detect the molecular structure changes induced by thermal processing methods using vibrational Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Three varieties of chickpea samples (CDC Alma, Cory, Frontier) were finely ground using a 0.12 mm screen. Spectral analyses were conducted using a JASCO FTIR-4200 spectroscope with Spectra Manager II software in the mid-infrared region from ca. 4000−800 cm−1 with a 4 cm−1 resolution. Data were analyzed using the “Mixed” procedure of SAS 9.4. Multiple regression was performed with PROC REG analysis for variable selection. Results showed that amide I area was higher (p = 0.038) in CDC Frontier than CDC Cory (30.85 vs. 24.64 AU). Amide I peak height (p = 0.028) was also higher in CDC Frontier and CDC Alma (0.45 AU in both) than CDC Cory (0.36 AU). Cellulosic compound (CEC) to total CHO (TCHO) area ratio was higher in CDC Frontier (0.05 AU) than the other two varieties (0.14 AU in both). As to thermal treatment impact, the results showed that total amide area was higher (p = 0.013) with autoclave and microwave heating (47.38 and 45.19 AU, respectively) than dry heating (33.06 AU). The CEC area was also higher (p < 0.001) for autoclave and microwave heating (3.74 and 3.61 AU, respectively) than dry heating (2.20 AU). Moreover, the ratio of amide I to II height was higher (p = 0.022) with microwave heating than dry heating (1.44 vs. 1.16 AU, respectively). Relationship analysis showed that the effective degraded crude protein (EDCP) and bypass dry matter (% BDM) were associated with STCHO peaks and CEC height (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.68). Also, feed milk value (FMVDVE) was associated with STC1, STC_A, and CEC_A (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.85). In conclusion, vibrational molecular spectroscopy mid-infrared FTIR was able to reveal different molecular spectral characteristics among the cool-season adapted CDC chickpea varieties and detect molecular structure changes induced by thermal processing (dry heating, autoclaving, and microwave heating)."

      "abstract": "Thermal treatment applied during the cooking of pulses leads to denaturation and even aggregation of the proteins, which may impact protein digestibility. Thermal transitions of lentil, chickpea, and bean proteins were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Protein-enriched samples were obtained by dry air classification of dehulled seeds and were heated to 160 °C, with water contents ranging from 0.2 to 4 kg/kg on a dry basis. The DSC peaks of the resulting endotherms were successfully modeled as overlapping Gaussian functions. The denaturation temperatures were modeled as a function of the temperature according to the Flory-Huggins theory. The modeling allows for the calculation of the degree of protein transition for any temperature and moisture condition. The denaturation diagrams reflect the different protein compositions of lentil, chickpea, and bean (particularly the 11S/7S globulin ratio). Chickpea proteins were more thermally stable than those from lentil and bean. Proteins underwent an irreversible transition, suggesting that unfolding and aggregation were coupled.",

      "abstract": "High pressure processing is a non-thermal method for preservation of various foods while retaining nutritional value and can be utilized for the development of ready-to-eat products. This original research investigated the effects of high pressure processing for development of a ready-to eat chickpea product using Australian kabuli chickpeas. Three pressure levels (200, 400, and 600 MPA) and two treatment times (1 and 5 min) were selected to provide six distinct samples. When compared to the conventionally cooked chickpeas, high pressure processed chickpeas had a more desirable texture due to decrease in firmness, chewiness, and gumminess. The general nutrient composition and individual mineral content were not affected by high pressure processing, however, a significant increase in the slowly digestible starch from 50.53 to 60.92 g/100 g starch and a concomitant decrease in rapidly digestible starch (11.10-8.73 g/100 g starch) as well as resistant starch (50.53-30.35 g/100 g starch) content was observed. Increased starch digestibility due to high pressure processing was recorded, whereas in vitro protein digestibility was unaffected. Significant effects of high pressure processing on the polyphenol content and antioxidant activities (DPPH, ABTS and ORAC) were observed, with the sample treated at the highest pressure for the longest duration (600 MPa, 5 min) showing the lowest values. These findings suggest that high pressure processing could be utilized to produce a functional, ready to eat kabuli chickpea product with increased levels of beneficial slowly digestible starch."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of pulsed electric fields (PEF) pretreatment on rehydration kinetics, firmness, and release of intracellular components of dried chickpeas during rehydration at 35 to 65°C. After soaking preconditioning, chickpeas were subjected to PEF treatments (2.5 and 3.3 kV/cm, 0.2 to 12.0 kJ/kg, 15 µs pulse width, 20 Hz frequency). PEF treated and untreated chickpeas were dried in crossflow air dryer and their rehydration at constant seed/water ratio of 1:5 was studied for 24 hr. During rehydration, moisture, firmness, and concentration of released proteins, carbohydrates and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO) were determined and described using appropriate mathematical models. PEF treatment led to up to 70% higher rehydration rates of dried chickpeas. This increase corresponds to rehydration time of approximately 1.5 hr, as opposed to 5 hr for untreated samples. Firmness of PEF treated chickpeas (for energy inputs higher than 3 kJ/kg) during rehydration decreased up to 30% compared to untreated samples. The firmness of untreated samples after 300 min of rehydration was achieved at much shorter times (up to 30 min) for PEF treated samples. At the end of 300 min of rehydration, more than 47.7%, 76.1%, and 86.6% of total raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose, respectively has been extracted, but only 0.03% of nutritionally valuable proteins from PEF treated chickpeas. Consequently, this study demonstrates that PEF processing could be implemented in dried chickpeas processing as pretreatment, for the reduction of rehydration time prior to cooking and of intestinal discomfort caused by RFO.",

HP treatment alone resulted in 89.1% hydration while a combination of pre-soaking followed by HP treatment resulted 93.8% hydration; however overnight soaking (12 h) of chickpeas at room temperature resulted only in 42.5% hydration. Texture softness and color brightness were enhanced by HP treatment with or without pre-soaking (2 h at 40 °C) as compared to overnight soaked chickpeas. HP treatment reduced tannin to 25 mg CE/100 g and phytic acid to 0.2% levels which were about one fifth of their content in raw chickpeas and significantly lower than in overnight soaked product. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that 600 MPa HP treated samples showed larger pore sizes and bigger starch granules corresponding with the higher hydration rates. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy results also showed a difference between raw and HP treated chickpeas. Overall, HP treatment was effective in reducing the anti-nutritional factors and soaking times and enhanced quality factors."

METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized crossover postprandial intervention study is conducted on 11 volunteers who consumed lentils, chickpeas, and white beans. Urine and serum samples are collected at distinct postprandial time points up to 48 h, and analyzed by LC-HR-MS untargeted metabolomics. Hypaphorine, trigonelline, several small peptides, and polyphenol-derived metabolites prove to be the most discriminating urinary metabolites. Two arginine-related compounds, dopamine sulfate and epicatechin metabolites, with their microbial derivatives, are identified only after intake of lentils, whereas protocatechuic acid is identified only after consumption of chickpeas. Urinary hydroxyjasmonic and hydroxydihydrojasmonic acids, as well as serum pipecolic acid and methylcysteine, are found after white bean consumption. Most of the metabolites identified in the postprandial study are replicated as discriminants in 24 h urine samples, demonstrating that in this case the use of a single, noninvasive sample is suitable for revealing the consumption of pulses. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present untargeted metabolomics work reveals a broad list of metabolites that are candidates for use as biomarkers of pulse intake. Further studies are needed to validate these BFIs and to find the best combinations of them to boost their specificity.",

This randomized cross-over study examined the glycemic and insulinemic impact of 50 grams of available carbohydrate from three test meals: plain white rice (control), black beans with rice, and chickpeas with rice among healthy adult women (n = 12, 18-65 years). Treatments were consumed on different mornings, a minimum of 7 days apart. Blood samples were collected at time 0 (fasting), and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min postprandial, and were subsequently analyzed for glucose and insulin concentrations. Glucose response based on the incremental area under the curve showed a significant difference by treatment (p = 0.027). Changes in blood glucose concentrations were significantly different for the black bean meal and the chickpea meal in comparison to rice alone at 60 min (p = 0.026 and p = 0.024), 90 min (p = 0.001 and p = 0.012) and 120 min post prandial (p = 0.024; black bean meal). Findings indicate that combinations of black beans and chickpeas with white rice improve glycemic response, providing evidence that has promising implications for dietary guidance to reduce postprandial glucose and related health risks through traditional food patterns.",

Functional oligosaccharide may positively regulate the intestinal microbiota. Therefore, effects of α-galactooligosaccharides (α-GOS) from chickpea on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome and gut bacterial dysbiosis were investigated. After 6 weeks of intervention, HFD led to significant increases in levels of blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, glycated serum protein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of mice compared to normal-chow-fed mice. Meanwhile, all of the α-GOS-treated groups significantly decreased above parameters compared to the HFD group. HFD could significantly decrease the content of all bacteria, especially Bacteroides (9.82 ± 0.09 versus 10.3 ± 0.10; p < 0.05) and Lactobacillus (6.67 ± 0.18 versus 7.30 ± 0.24; p < 0.05), and a decrease in the production of short-chain fatty acids was also observed. Treatment with α-GOS significantly increased the number of Bifidobacterium (6.07 ± 0.23 of the low-dose treatment versus 5.65 ± 0.20 of the HFD group) and Lactobacillus (7.22 ± 0.16 of the low-dose treatment). It also significantly promoted the secretion of propionic and butyric acids. These results indicate that α-GOS from chickpeas may affect the metabolic disorders and gut bacterial ecosystem in a positive way.",

      "abstract": "Desi-type chickpeas, which have long been used as a natural treatment for diabetes, have been reported to lower visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance induced by a chronic high-fat diet in rats. In this study, in order to examine the effects of chickpeas of this type in an in vitro system, we used the 3T3-L1 mouse cell line, a subclone of Swiss 3T3 cells, which can differentiate into cells with an adipocyte-like phenotype, and we used ethanol extracts of chickpeas (ECP) instead of chickpeas. Treatment of the 3T3-L1 cells with ECP led to a decrease in the lipid content in the cells. The desaturation index, defined as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)/saturated fatty acids (SFAs), was also decreased by ECP due to an increase in the cellular content of SFAs and a decrease in the content of MUFAs. The decrease in this index may reflect a decreased reaction from SFA to MUFA, which is essential for fat storage. To confirm this hypothesis, we conducted a western blot analysis, which revealed a reduction in the amount of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), a key enzyme catalyzing the reaction from SFA to MUFA. We observed simultaneous inactivations of enzymes participating in lipogenesis, i.e., liver kinase B1 (LKB1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and AMPK, by phosphorylation, which may lead to the suppression of reactions from acetyl-CoA to SFA via malonyl-CoA in lipogenesis. We also investigated whether lipolysis is affected by ECP. The amount of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), an enzyme important for the oxidation of fatty acids, was increased by ECP treatment. ECP also led to an increase in uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), reported as a key protein for the oxidation of fatty acids. All of these results obtained regarding lipogenesis and fatty acid metabolism in our in vitro system are consistent with the results previously shown in rats. We also examined the effects on SCD1 and lipid contents of ethanol extracts of Kabuli-type chickpeas, which are used worldwide. The effects were similar, but of much lesser magnitude compared to those of ECP described above. Thus, Desi-type chickpeas may prove to be effective for the treatment of diabetes, as they can alter the lipid content, thus reducing fat storage.",

This study investigated the effects of isoflavones in chickpea sprouts germinated in light (IGL) and isoflavones in chickpea seeds (ICS) on insulin resistance through their role in suppression of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Results showed that IGL and ICS inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes induced by differentiation medium in a dose-dependent manner, and the suppressive effect of IGL was stronger (p < 0.05) than that of ICS, evidenced by a decrease of Oil Red O staining and intracellular triacylglycerol content in the mature adipocytes. IGL and ICS also stimulated glucose uptake significantly (p < 0.05). Besides, IGL and ICS treatment caused a significant decrease in mRNA and protein expression levels of adipogenesis-related transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (ap2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), and glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) in 3T3-L1 cells were also markedly down-regulated (p < 0.05).",

Such properties can be influenced by the thermal treatment used to cook this legume and produce a snack named leblebi. From the consumers' point of view, it is desirable to improve texture and palatability of the chickpea by the processing steps used to make leblebi. However, consumers are increasingly concerned with the nutritional value of snack foods. RESULTS: Nutritional components and digestibility properties of single and double heat-treated chickpea, single and double roasted leblebi and white leblebi were studied. High sodium, starch damage and soluble dietary fiber content were observed in white leblebi; while the other samples showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher insoluble dietary fiber content. Heat treatment and processing significantly (P < 0.05) altered the viscosity and starch properties of the samples. High resistant starch content (28.28% to 30.20%) and low estimated glycemic index (38.67 to 41.28) in heat-treated chickpeas and roasted leblebi were observed. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that heat-treated chickpea and roasted leblebi have good nutritional quality and low glycemic response. White leblebi had relatively high sodium content and glycemic response. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.",

It is characterized by a high content of protein, fat, vitamins, fiber, and a lower content of carbohydrates than flour of wheat. Chickpeas may contain antinutritional compounds that can impair utilization of the nutrients by people. Heat treatment is an effective method to increase the amount of protein available for intestinal digestibility. Adding chickpeas to a foodstuff can increase their nutritional value and reduce the acrylamide content. Acrylamide is an antinutritional substance present in foods, such as bread, snacks, and chips. Chickpea flour and protein may be new way to a reduce the content of acrylamide in products of this type. The addition of chickpea flour affects the sensory and textural properties.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Undernutrition during childhood is a common disorder in the developing countries, however most research has focussed much on its treatment rather than its prevention. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the potential of using chickpeas in infant follow-on formula production against the requirements of WHO/FAO on complementary foods and EU regulations on follow-on formula. METHODS: Chickpeas were germinated for 72 hours followed by boiling, drying and dehulling in order to minimise associated anti-nutrition factors. Saccharifying enzymes were used to hydrolyse starch to maltose and the resulting flours were analysed for their protein content and amino acid profile. RESULTS: The protein content (percentage) increased from 16.66 ± 0.35 and 20.24 ± 0.50 to 20.00 ± 0.15 and 21.98 ± 0.80 for the processed desi and kabuli cultivar compared to raw chickpeas, respectively (P < 0.05). There was insignificant change (P = 0.05) in amino acid profile following processing and the resulting flour was found to meet the amino acid requirements of WHO/FAO protein reference for 0-24 month's children. CONCLUSION: The designed chickpea based infant follow-on formula meets the WHO/FAO requirements on complementary foods and also the EU regulations on follow-on formula with minimal addition of oils, minerals and vitamins. It uses chickpea as a common source of carbohydrate and protein hence making it more economical and affordable for the developing countries without compromising the nutrition quality.",

A third, lower-fibre wheat diet provided further information on dietary fibre quantity and bowel function and satiety. METHOD: Twenty-seven free-living adults followed two randomized, crossover dietary interventions each of five weeks duration. The chickpea diet included canned drained chickpeas, bread and shortbread biscuits containing 30% chickpea flour. The wheat diet included high-fibre wheat breakfast cereals and wholemeal bread. The diets were isoenergetic to the participants' usual diet, matched for macronutrient content and controlled for dietary fibre. Following on from the second randomised intervention, a sub-group of 18 participants underwent a third, isoenergetic lower-fibre wheat diet that included low-fibre breakfast cereals and bread. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed reductions in serum TC of 0.25 mmol/L (p < 0.01) and LDL-C of 0.20 mmol/L (p = 0.02) following the chickpea diet compared to the wheat. An unintended significant increase in PUFA and corresponding decrease in MUFA consumption occurred during the chickpea diet and statistical adjustment for this reduced but did not eliminate the effect on serum lipids. There was no significant difference in glucose tolerance. Perceived general bowel health improved significantly during the chickpea diet although there was considerable individual variation. Some participants reported greater satiety during the chickpea diet. CONCLUSIONS: The small but significant decrease in serum TC and LDL-C during the chickpea diet compared to the equivalent fibre wheat diet was partly due to unintentional changes in macronutrient intake occurring because of chickpea ingestion. If dietary energy and macronutrients were not controlled, chickpea consumption might result in greater benefits via influence on these factors.",

Rats were fed a normal-fat diet (NFD), a high-fat diet (HFD) or a high-fat plus chickpea diet (HFD+CP) for 8 months. The epididymal fat pad weight v. total body weight of rats was higher in the HFD group (0.032 (sd 0.0042) g/g) than in the NFD group (0.015 (sd 0.0064) g/g) and smaller in the HFD+CP group (0.023 (sd 0.0072) g/g) compared with the HFD group (P < 0.05). Chickpea treatment also induced a favourable plasma lipid profile reflecting decreased TAG, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and LDL-C:HDL-cholesterol levels (P < 0.05). HFD-fed rats had higher TAG concentration in muscle and liver, whereas the addition of chickpeas to the HFD drastically lowered TAG concentration (muscle, 39 %; liver, 23 %). The activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in epididymal adipose tissue and hepatic TAG lipase in liver recorded a 40 and 23 % increase respectively in HFD rats compared with those in NFD rats; dietary chickpeas completely normalised the levels. Furthermore, chickpea-treated obese rats also showed a markedly lower leptin and LPL mRNA content in epididymal adipose tissue. An insulin tolerance test, oral glucose tolerance test and insulin-releasing test showed that chickpeas significantly improved insulin resistance, and prevented postprandial hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia induced by the chronic HFD. The present findings provide a rational basis for the consumption of chickpeas as a functional food ingredient, which may be beneficial for correcting dyslipidaemia and preventing diabetes.",

In Exp. 1, 8 Holstein (615 +/- 97 kg of initial BW) and 8 Angus-crossbred steers (403 +/- 73 kg of initial BW) fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulas were blocked by breed and used in a randomized complete block design to assess the effects of pulse grain inclusion in receiving diets on intake, ruminal fermentation, and site of digestion. Experiment 2 was a 39-d feedlot receiving trial in which 176 mixed-breed steers (254 +/- 19 kg of initial BW) were used in a randomized complete block design to determine the effects of pulse grains on DMI, ADG, and G:F in newly received feedlot cattle. In both studies, pulse grains (field peas, lentils, or chickpea) replaced corn and canola meal as the grain component in diets fed as a total mixed ration. Treatments included 1) corn and canola meal (control); 2) field pea; 3) lentil; and 4) chickpea. Preplanned orthogonal contrasts were conducted between control vs. chickpea, control vs. field pea, and control vs. lentil. In Exp. 1, there were no differences among treatments for DMI (11.63 kg/d, 2.32% of BW daily, P = 0.63) or OM intake (P = 0.63). No treatment effects for apparent ruminal (P = 0.10) and total tract OM digestibilities (P = 0.40) were detected when pulse grains replaced corn and canola meal. Crude protein intake (P = 0.78), microbial CP flow (P = 0.46), total tract CP digestibility (P = 0.45), and microbial efficiency (P = 0.18) were also not influenced by treatment. Total-tract ADF (P = 0.004) and NDF (P = 0.04) digestibilities were greater with field pea vs. control. Total VFA concentrations were lower for field pea (P = 0.009) and lentil (P < 0.001) compared with control. Chickpea, field pea, and lentil had lower (P < or = 0.03) acetate molar proportion than control. Ruminal pH (P = 0.18) and NH3 (P = 0.14) were not different among treatments. In Exp. 2, calves fed chickpea, field pea, and lentil had greater overall DMI (7.59 vs. 6.98 kg/d; P < or = 0.07) and final BW (332 vs. 323 kg; P < or = 0.04), whereas chickpea and lentil had greater ADG (1.90 vs. 1.71 kg/d; P < or = 0.04) than control. Gain efficiency (P = 0.18) did not differ among treatments. Steers fed pulse grains had similar CP and OM digestibilities compared with a combination of corn and canola meal in receiving diets. Pulse grains are a viable alternative for replacement of protein supplements in receiving diets for beef cattle.",

Protein (0.9% of energy, p = 0.01) and monounsaturated fat (3.3% of total fat, p < 0.001) intakes were slightly but significantly lower and the carbohydrate intake significantly higher (1.7% of energy, p < 0.001) on the chickpea-supplemented diet as compared with the wheat-supplemented diet. Multivariate analyses suggested that the differences in serum lipids were mainly due to small differences in polyunsaturated fatty acid and dietary fibre contents between the two intervention diets. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of chickpeas in an intervention diet results in lower serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as compared with a wheat-supplemented diet.",

      "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the replacement of soybean meal by extruded chickpeas in diets of growing-finishing pigs on meat quality. In a 17wk study 48 growing-finishing crossbred pigs were fed ad libitum. The experimental design included four treatments, each one of 12 pigs; the ECKP0 treatment was fed with diet containing soybean meal and no chickpeas (control), while treatments ECKP100, ECKP200 and ECKP300 were fed with diets containing 100, 200 and 300kg/t of extruded chickpeas, respectively. The lean meat quality of the longissimus lumborum et thoracis muscle was evaluated by chemical analysis (moisture, protein, fat and ash), fatty acid profile, pH measurement, cooking loss, color evaluation, and sensory evaluation. Odor and taste, tenderness, juiciness, and overall acceptability were scored on 1-10 scales by a group of 10 experienced assessors after a standard cooking regime. Small differences were observed between control and experimental groups in chemical composition (P>0.05). Fatty acid profiles, pH measurements and color evaluation did not differ among treatments (P>0.05), while cooking loss was significantly lower in the control group (P<0.05). The taste panel gave slightly higher scores for the tenderness and juiciness for the control group compared with the chickpea treatments (P<0.05). No differences were observed between control and experimental groups in taste scores (P>0.05). It is concluded that the replacement of soybean meal by extruded chickpeas, when substituted isonitrogenously and isoenergetically at inclusion levels up to 300kg/t of pig, does not influence significantly meat quality."

      "abstract": "The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and restaurants.",

      "abstract": "1. Two experiments were carried out to determine the effect of inclusion of raw (kabuli and desi) and autoclaved (desi) chickpea seeds in wheat-based starter diets in chickens grown to 28 d of age on the performance, digestive organ sizes, nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy (AMEn), ileal apparent protein and starch digestibilities (APD and ASD) and intestinal alpha-amylase and trypsin activities. 2. In the first experiment, diets were formulated to contain 0, 150, 300 and 450 g/kg of raw kabuli chickpea seeds. Increasing the proportion of seed in the diet negatively influenced body weight gain, food intake and food efficiency. The relative weights of the pancreas, liver and gizzard and the relative lengths of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and caeca were increased significantly when the chickpea seeds were included in the diets. Correspondingly, APD, ASD, alpha-amylase and trypsin activities and AMEn were reduced significantly when the chickpea seed was incorporated in the diets. 3. In the 2nd experiment, diets were formulated to contain 75 and 150 g/kg of raw and autoclaved desi chickpea seeds. Weight gain and food intake of the chicks given desi chickpea diets were significantly reduced compared with those fed on the control diet. Increasing the proportion of seed in the diet negatively influenced body weight gain, food intake and food efficiency. Moreover, a significant increment in the relative weights of liver and pancreas, and in the relative lengths of duodenum, ileum and caeca was observed when the concentration of chickpea seeds in the diets was increased. Feeding autoclaved seeds significantly increased the weight gains and the food intakes. However, food efficiency was not modified by the autoclaving. Relative weights of gizzard and liver and relative lengths of ileum were decreased significantly by the inclusion of autoclaved desi chickpea in the diet. 4. We concluded that the inclusion of kabuli (up to 450 g/kg) and desi (up to 150 g/kg) chickpea seeds produced a negative effect on the performance of the birds, and an increment in the relative weights and lengths of the digestive organs. In addition, the incorporation of kabuli chickpea produced a reduction of protein and starch digestibilities, alpha-amylase and trypsin activities, and AMEn of food compared with the birds given the control diet. Autoclaved treatment of desi chickpea improved the performance of the birds.",

      "abstract": "The most successful induction of tetraploidy was obtained with 2 hour treatment by 0.25% aqueous colchicine solution of 18-hour watersoaked desi chickpeas material. However, kabuli types needed only 1 hour treatment under similar conditions. Gigantism accompanied induction of polyploidy in desi as well as kabuli types but yield and fertility were greatly reduced. The meiotic abnormalities accompanying polyploidy were multivalent association of chromosomes followed by unequal disjunction, chromosome bridges, laggards etc. The percentage of stainable pollen, however, was at par between diploids and tetraploids. Gene control of percentage seed setting was observed in both levels of ploidy. A striking feature of the studies was the high seed setting percentage in 4n F 1 material resulting from diverse crosses, viz., desi×kabuli. A probable reduction in multivalent association coupled with yield increases in segregants from the later generation of tetraploids indicates the possibility of selection for higher yield and fertility from polyploids, particularly from some hybrid material."
