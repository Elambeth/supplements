      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of whey obtained by either enzyme (sweet) or acid treatment on wound healing remains unclear. This study investigated the effectiveness of camel and bovine whey prepared enzymatically (CSW and BSW) or by pH reduction (CAW and BAW). After removing the cream from milk, HCl or rennet was used to remove casein, resulting in acid or sweet whey, respectively, followed by lactose removal using dialysis. Casein removal was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Wound-healing activity was measured in vitro on HT-29 cells by scratch assay. All four whey samples (0-1000 mg L-1) were applied on the cells, and the closure of the cell-free scratched areas was monitored for 48 h. RESULTS: All whey samples increased the cell migration significantly (P < 0.05) to help close the cell-free areas as an indication of wound healing compared to the negative control. However, the closure amounts between the highest dose (1000 mg L-1) and the control were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Acid whey samples significantly (P < 0.05) elevated the closure speed compared to the sweet whey samples. The highest closure percentage (64.69%) was achieved after treatment with 10 mg L-1 CAW for 48 h. Between the sweet whey samples, BSW was significantly (P < 0.05) more effective in closing the cell-free zone compared to CSW. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the wound-healing potential of camel and bovine whey in vitro by comparing their effects on HT-29 cell migration. CAW showed the greatest activity and may find uses as a treatment agent in wound healing. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Camel's milk is an important part of staple diet in several parts of the world, particularly in the arid and semi-arid zones. Camel's milk is rich in health-beneficial substances, such as bioactive peptides, lactoferrin, zinc, and mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids. These substances could help in the treatment of some important human diseases like tuberculosis, asthma, gastrointestinal diseases, and jaundice. Camel's milk composition is more variable compared to cow's milk. The effects of feed, breed, age, and lactation stage on milk composition are more significant in camel. Region and season significantly change the ratio of compounds in camel's milk. Camel's whey protein is not only composed of numerous soluble proteins, but also has indigenous proteases such as chymotrypsin A and cathepsin D. In addition to their high nutritional value, these whey proteins have unique characteristics, including physical, chemical, physiological, functional, and technological features that are useful in the food application. The hydrolysis of camel's milk proteins leads to the formation of bioactive peptides, which affect major organ systems of the body and impart physiological functions to these systems. The camel's milk has antioxidant, antimicrobial, angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides, antidiabetic as well as anticholesterol activities."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Camel milk (CM) and Nigella sativa (NS) have been traditionally claimed to cure wide range of diseases and used as medicine in different part of world, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Several research studies have been published that proved beneficial effects of CM and NS. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to investigate the antihepatotxic potential of CM and NS oil (NSO) against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepato and nephrotoxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty female Albino Wistar rats were randomly divided in to six groups having five rats in each group. A single subcutaneous injection of TAA (100 mg/kg b. w.) was administered to all the rats in Group-II to VI on 1st day to induce hepatorenal damage. Group I served as a normal control while Group II served as toxic control for comparison purpose. Experimental animals in Group III, IV, and V were supplemented with fresh CM, (250 mL/24 h/cage), NSO (2 mL/kg/day p. o.), and NSO + fresh CM, respectively. Group VI was treated with a polyherbal hepatoprotective Unani medicine Jigreen (2 mL/kg/day p. o.) for 21 days. TAA-induced hepatorenal damage and protective effects of CM and NSO were assessed by analyzing liver and kidney function tests in the serum. Histopathology of liver and kidney tissues was also carried out to corroborate the findings of biochemical investigation. RESULTS: The results indicated that the TAA intoxicated rats showed significant increase in the alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, lipid profile, urea, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, and potassium levels in serum. Treatment of rats with CM, NSO, and CM plus NSO combination and Jigreen significantly reversed the damage and brought down the serum biochemical parameters and lipid profile toward the normal levels. The histopathological studies also support the hepato and nephroprotective effects of CM and NSO. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the ameliorative effects of CM, NSO, and CM plus NSO combination against TAA-induced hepatorenal toxicity in rats. SUMMARY: The antihepatotxic potential of Camel's Milk (CM) and Nigella sativa oil (NSO) against thioacetamide (TAA) induced hepatorenal toxicity was evaluated in ratsThe oral administration of fresh CM (250 mL/24h/cage), NSO (2 mL/kg/day) and NSO+fresh CM and Jigreen (2 mL/kg/day) for 21 days significantly decreased the hepatorenal toxicity as evidenced from analyzed biochemical parameters in serum and histopathological studies of liver and kidney tissuesThis study demonstrated the ameliorative effects of CM and NSO against TAA induced hepatorenal toxicity.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) affects between 0.6 and 0.9% of the general population, and its treatment implies the total elimination of the intake of this protein. Camel's milk has been suggested as an alternative for patients over one year of age who suffer from CMPA due to the difference in the amino acid sequence from that of cow's milk. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of camel's milk in children with CMPA. METHODS: Crossed clinical trial for the use of camel's milk vs. amino acid formula, carried out at the Dr. Federico Gómez Children's Hospital of Mexico (HIMFG) on patients between one and 18 years of age with diagnosed CMPA confirmed through double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs). Only those whose allergies were confirmed were randomly placed into two groups: those to be administered camel's milk and those to be administered the amino-acid formula for two weeks, followed by a six-week wash-out period, and then a group crossing for a further two weeks. RESULTS: 49 patients with suspected CMPA were included in the study; the diagnosis was confirmed through DBPCFCs in 15 patients, who were those who participated in the study. After having been administered camel's milk, none of the patients presented adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Camel's milk is safe and tolerable in patients above one year of age with CMPA and can be considered as a good alternative given the benefit of its taste compared to other formulas.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Camel milk (CM) is recommended for liver disease patients in Egypt for a strong belief that it has a curative effect. OBJECTIVE: The effect of consumption of CM with or without chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin was evaluated on induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar male rats (56) were divided into eight groups (7 rats each). Group I was control. Hepatocarcinogenesis was initiated by a single dose of intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) (200 mg/kg BW) and promoted by phenobarbitone (500 ppm) in drinking water in groups V, VI, VII and VIII. Treatment started from 28th till 38th week using CM (5 mL/day) and/or cisplatin (5 mg/kg/3 weeks) in groups II, III IV, VI, VII and VIII. Biochemical analysis, lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in liver tissue were performed. Histopathology of liver and kidney and immunohistochemistry of placental glutathione-S-transferase (P-GST) in liver were performed and analyzed using image analysis. RESULTS: Albumin concentration and SOD activity were 3.13 ± 0.23 and 311.45 ± 41.71 in group VII (DENA & cisplatin), whereas they were 4.3 ± 0.15 and 540.5 ± 29.94 in group VII (DENA, CM and cisplatin). The mean area of altered hepatocellular foci and P-GST altered foci decreased in group VI (DENA and CM) (1049.6 ± 174.78 and 829.1 ± 261) and group VIII (cisplatin and CM) (1615.12 ± 436 and 543.9 ± 127) compared to group V (DENA only) (4173.74 ± 510.7 and 3169.49 ± 538.61). Cisplatin caused chronic interstitial nephritis, which was slightly alleviated in group VIII (CM and cisplatin). CONCLUSIONS: CM had an antioxidant effect and together with cisplatin managed to decrease hepatocarcinogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is a global health concern and is a major cause of death among women. In Oman, it is the most common cancer in women, with an incidence rate of 15.6 per 100,000 Omani females. Various anticancer remedies have been discovered from natural products in the past and the search is continuing for additional examples. Cytotoxic natural compounds may have a major role in cancer therapy either in potentiating the effect of chemotherapy or reducing its harmful effects. Recently, a few studies have reported advantages of using crude camel milk in treating some forms of cancer. However, no adequate data are available on the lyophilised camel's milk responsibility for triggering apoptosis and oxidative stress associated with human breast cancer. The present study aimed to address the role of the lyophilised camel's milk in inducing proliferation repression of BT-474 and HEp-2 cells compared with the non-cancer HCC1937 BL cell line. Lyophilized camel's milk fundamentally repressed BT-474 cells growth and proliferation through the initiation of either the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways as indicated by both caspase-3 mRNA and its action level, and induction of death receptors in BT-474 but not the HEp-2 cell line. In addition, lyophilised camel's milk enhanced the expression of oxidative stress markers, heme-oxygenase-1 and reactive oxygen species production in BT-474 cells. Increase in caspase-3 mRNA levels by the lyophilised camel's milk was completely prevented by the actinomycin D, a transcriptional inhibitor. This suggests that lyophilized camel's milk increased newly synthesized RNA. Interestingly,it significantly (p<0.003) repressed the growth of HEp-2 cells and BT-474 cells after treatment for 72 hours while 24 hours treatment repressed BT-474 cells alone. This finding suggests that the lyophilised camel's milk might instigate apoptosis through initiation of an alternative apoptotic pathway.",

      "abstract": "Current treatment strategies for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with several adverse effects, and thus, the search for effective agents with minimal side effects merits attention. Camel's milk (CM) is endowed with antioxidant/anti-inflammatory features and has been reported to protect against diabetes and hepatic injury, however, its effects on IBD have not been previously explored. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the potential alleviating effects of CM against TNBS-induced colitis in rats. CM (10 ml/kg b.i.d. by oral gavage) effectively suppressed the severity of colon injury as evidenced by amelioration of macroscopic damage, colon weight/length ratio, histopathological alterations, leukocyte influx and myeloperoxidase activity. Administration of CM mitigated the colonic levels of TNF-α and IL-10 cytokines. The attenuation of CM to colon injury was also associated with suppression of oxidative stress via reduction of lipid peroxides and nitric oxide along with boosting the antioxidant defenses through restoration of colon glutathione and total anti-oxidant capacity. In addition, caspases-3 activity, an apoptotic marker, was inhibited. Together, our study highlights evidences for the promising alleviating effects of CM in colitis. Thus, CM may be an interesting complementary approach for the management of IBD.",
