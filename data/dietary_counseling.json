      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Pediatric patients with non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergies (non-IgE-GIFAs) may experience alterations of nutritional status. This non-randomized, prospective intervention study investigated the impact of dietary counseling on nutritional status in pediatric patients with non-IgE-GIFAs. Methods: Patients of both sexes aged 0-14 years newly diagnosed with non-IgE-GIFAs received dietary counseling provided by certified pediatric dietitians immediately after diagnosis. Nutritional status parameters were assessed to identify nutritional status alterations at baseline and after 12 months of intervention (T12). Results: The study included 100 patients (58% male, mean age 8.5 ± 8.8 months). Non-IgE-GIFAs phenotypes included food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE, 44%), food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES, 11%), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP, 17%), and food protein-induced motility disorders (FPIMD, 28%). At diagnosis, 1% was affected by obesity (1 FPIAP), 5% were affected by overweight (2 FPE, 1 FPIAP, and 2 FPIMD), 7% were moderately underweight (5 FPE and 2 FPIMD), 1% was severely underweight (1 FPE), 7% were moderately stunted (4 FPE, 1 FPIAP, and 2 FPIMD), 16% were moderately wasted (11 FPE, 1 FPIES, 1 FPIAP, and 3 FPIMD), and 4% were severely wasted (2 FPE and 2 FPIMD). At T12, improvements in anthropometric parameters were observed, along with a reduction in the prevalence of malnutrition by excess (6% at diagnosis vs. 2% at T12) and a reduction in the undernutrition subtypes rate, including underweight, stunting, and wasting (26% at diagnosis vs. 3% at T12, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Non-IgE-GIFAs can negatively impact the nutritional status of pediatric patients. Thus, dietary counseling could be an effective strategy for preventing and managing nutritional alterations in these patients.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Given the rising global population of older adults and their association with edentulism and the use of complete removable prostheses [CRP], it is imperative to pursue solutions for issues such as the relationship between poor diets and masticatory deficiency. OBJECTIVE: To examine the research on the efficacy of dietary counseling in enhancing mastication and nutrition in older adults with CRP. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed in the PubMed, Trip, and Web of Science databases. RESULTS: 812 results were retrieved from the databases, from which 6 clinical studies that fulfilled the qualifying criteria were selected. The selected studies reported reduced nutrition in patients with CRP due to impaired masticatory function. Research suggests that employing basic dietary guidelines or simplified nutritional recommendations enhances the masticatory function of patients with CRP, thereby ensuring sufficient nutritional intake. CONCLUSION: Dietary counseling improves nutritional intake and masticatory function in patients with CRP. This would allow simple dietary advice to be given to patients with total prostheses in clinical practice. Further randomized clinical trials are recommended to increase the available evidence.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acne is significantly influenced by glycemic load (GL), which is the result of the quantity of carbohydrates consumed and how quickly they are metabolized. There is an association between high-GL foods and severe acne. Such diets increase insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, which then stimulate sebum production and androgen hormone release, which ultimately results in the development of acne. Previous studies have shown a high prevalence of acne in South Asia, but there is a lack of study on acne and its determinants among females in Pakistan. AIM: This study aims to assess the effect of low-glycemic index foods and dietary counseling in potentially improving the quality of life of female acne patients and reducing post-acne lesions and the severity of the disease. METHODS: The sample size consisted of 50 females aged 15-35 years. The study aimed to see how a low-GL diet could affect the severity of acne. The trial included 50 participants, split into two groups: 25 in the control group and 25 in the treatment group. The trial went on for 12 weeks and used a food questionnaire to gather data each month. Participants were given scores based on how much high-GL food they ate. The score range between 0 and 35 showed a low intake of high-GL foods, and a score range between 35 and 55 was considered to be the average intake of high-GL foods. A score range between 55 and 75 showed a very high intake of high-GL foods. Higher scores indicated higher GL food consumption. RESULTS: In the control group, after one month, 18 participants (70%) had GL scores above 55, which correlated with higher acne severity. In contrast, only three participants (12%) had low-GL scores (0-35). The treatment group showed significant improvement; initially, 15 participants (60%) had high-GL scores, but this number decreased to nine participants (40%) by the end of the study. After three months, 10 participants (45%) in the treatment group achieved low-GL scores (0-35), compared to only two participants (10%) in the control group. This improvement was accompanied by a decrease in average acne severity from 2.68 to 1.56 and an increase in water intake and promoted better skin health among females. CONCLUSION: Dietary counseling along with low-GL foods can improve acne severity and lesions in adult females. This treatment also enhanced self-confidence and social acceptance."

      "abstract": "Radiotherapy is a common cancer treatment, and concurrent nutritional interventions can maintain nutritional status and improve clinical and supportive care outcomes. However, optimal nutritional interventions during radiotherapy are not firmly established. Herein, we assessed the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of dietary counseling interventions without oral nutrition supplements on health outcomes in adults receiving radiotherapy for cancer in a systematic review. Prospective clinical trials that implemented nutritional counseling interventions during radiotherapy were identified from four databases from inception through December 2023. Feasibility, safety, and efficacy were extracted from 32 articles that described 23 randomized and 4 non-randomized clinical trials. The interventions included individualized nutritional counseling (n = 14 articles), nutritional counseling plus exercise (n = 4), and nutritional counseling focused on increasing or reducing intake of specific nutrients (n = 9). Trials targeted head and neck (n = 12), pelvic cancers (n = 14), and/or breast (n = 5) cancers. Control groups had variable designs and included general nutrition education and intervention as needed. Studies recruited 120 ± 104 participants (range 26-468). Interventions tended to be feasible regarding retention and attendance at sessions, though feasibility metrics varied among different interventions. Most interventions were safe with no studies reporting adverse events attributable to dietary intervention. Individualized dietary counseling interventions tended to lead to between-group differences favoring the intervention group in regard to improved nutritional status, maintenance or attenuation of loss of body mass, improved quality of life, and reduced radiation-induced toxicities. Diets that encouraged/discouraged specific nutrients tended to recruit patients receiving radiation to the pelvic area and resulted in positive or neutral effects on gastrointestinal symptoms. In conclusion, nutritional interventions appear to be feasible, safe, and effective during radiotherapy for various symptom outcomes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Clinical evidence suggests that nutrition interventions can significantly improve symptoms of major depressive disorder; however, the effect on clinical anxiety symptoms in individuals with anxiety disorders has not been studied. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a nutrition intervention. The secondary objectives included assessing changes in anxiety symptom severity, diet quality, self-efficacy, mindful eating, quality of life, and biomarkers. METHODS: This study was a randomized, wait-list controlled pilot trial delivering a 12-week, biweekly dietary counseling intervention and omega-3 supplementation to 50 adult women with generalized anxiety disorder. Questionnaires and blood work were completed at baseline, after the waiting period, and after the intervention. RESULTS: 443 individuals expressed interest within eight months; 50 met the criteria for enrollment. The mean number of sessions attended was 6.4. Final questionnaires were completed by 46 participants. Eighty-four percent of participants strongly agreed with the statement 'My experience during this study was positive'. The mean anxiety symptom severity score in the intervention group was 26.2 (95% CI 22.94-29.48) at baseline and 11.0 (95% CI 8.05-13.87) at week 12. The mean diet quality score was 7.2 (95% CI 6.32-8.10) and 10.5 (95% CI 9.55-11.49) at baseline and week 12, respectively. Among the waitlist participants, the mean baseline anxiety score was 29.3 (95% CI 24.73-33.91) and 26.8 (95% CI 22.09-31.56) at week 12. DISCUSSION: This study was feasible and acceptable. Participation in the intervention was associated with a decrease in anxiety symptoms. These findings lay the foundation for large-scale studies. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05573672."

      "abstract": "Background: Malnutrition harms treatment outcomes, QoL, and survival in lung cancer patients. Effective dietary counseling can improve nutrition, but few randomized controlled trials have focused on lung cancer patients. The objective of this study was to determine if dietary counseling improves nutritional and treatment outcomes when compared to routine care. Methods: This open-label parallel RCT was conducted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital in Thailand. The investigators used computer-generated blocked randomization to assign patients to dietary counseling by a nutritionist or routine care. The nutritionist sessions occurred before treatment, with follow-ups at 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the mean percentage change in the body weight of patients at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in the BMI, nutrition score, QoL, serum albumin level, lymphocyte count, energy and protein intake, treatment response, PFS, and OS. Results: Between April 2020 and May 2022, after completing recruitment, 80 lung cancer patients were randomized: 43 to dietary counseling and 37 to routine care. The dietary counseling group showed significant benefits, with smaller decreases in body weight at 3-4 weeks (-0.8% vs. -2.6%, p = 0.05) and 12 weeks (-1.1% vs. -4.3%, p = 0.05). They also had higher energy and protein intake levels and better treatment response rates. The secondary outcomes and significant adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions: Dietary counseling helps to maintain body weight, maintain dietary intake, and enhance treatment responses in lung cancer patients. Although not all nutritional markers or survival outcomes were affected, these findings highlight the importance of early nutritional interventions."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The impact of dietary counseling on body composition in early breast cancer patients (EBC) treated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a diet counseling program on weight, BMI, total and regional body composition in patients treated with AIs. METHODS: This observational study involved 194 EBC patients, of which 97 attended a 6-month personalized counseling program, based on Mediterranean diet principles (cohort A) and 97 did not (cohort B). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was used to measure the total and regional fat and lean body mass, before (baseline) and after at least 18 months of AI-therapy. RESULTS: Weight and BMI increased significantly, on the average, in cohort B, but not in cohort A. In the cohorts A and B, fat mass increased by 10 % and 7.7 % respectively, while lean mass decreased by 3.3 % and 2.6 % from before to after AI therapy, without statistically significant differences between them using the Mann-Whitney test. The changes in body composition were greater in premenopausal than in postmenopausal women at cancer diagnosis. The proportion of patients with sarcopenia, obesity and sarcopenic obesity increased from before to after AI therapy, similarly in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with AIs reported an increase in fat mass and a decrease in lean mass, and consequently an increase in sarcopenia and obesity, regardless of the participation in a dietary counseling program. A combined dietary counseling and physical exercise program may be necessary for preventing these unfavourable changes in these patients.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to measure the frequency of dietary counseling documentation for patients recently hospitalized with CVD. DESIGN: This was an observational study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Patients were included from the Michigan Value Collaborative Multipayer Claims Registry from October 2015 to February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The study measured the frequency of medical claims that document dietary counseling ≤90 days after hospitalization (ie, an episode of care) for CVD events (coronary artery bypass grafting, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and percutaneous coronary intervention). Dietary counseling documentation was defined as having an encounter-level International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision code for dietary counseling or current procedural terminology code for medical nutrition therapy or cardiac rehabilitation. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure variation in documentation across gender, age, comorbidities, hospital geography, CVD event, and insurer. RESULTS: There were 175,631 episodes of care (congesitve heart failure 47.1%, acute myocardial infarction 28.7%, percutaneous coronary intervention 17.0%, and coronary artery bypass grafting 7.3%) among 146,185 individuals. Most episodes occurred among men (55.8%) and those older than age 65 years (71.9%). Dietary counseling was documented for 22.8% of episodes and was more common as cardiac rehabilitation (18.6%) than other encounter types (5.1%). In multivariable analysis, there was lower odds for dietary counseling documentation among those older than age 65 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.77; P < .001), women (OR 0.83; P < .001), with chronic kidney disease (OR 0.74; P < .001), or diabetes (OR 0.95; P < .001), but greater odds for those with obesity (OR 1.28; P < .001) and nonmetropolitan hospitals (OR 1.31; P < .001). Compared with coronary artery bypass grafting, acute myocardial infarction (OR 0.29; P < .001), confestive heart failure (OR 0.12; P < .001), and percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 0.36; P < .001) episodes had lower odds to have dietary counseling coded. Compared with Traditional Medicare, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization plans had lower odds, whereas Commercial or Medicare Advantage preferred provider organization and Commercial health maintenance organization plans had higher odds to have dietary counseling documented. Results were mostly similar when evaluated by race. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary counseling was infrequently documented after hospitalization for CVD episodes in medical claims in a Michigan-based multipayer claims database with large variation by reason for hospitalization and patient factors.",

The general information, physical activity (PA) status, biochemical findings, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) of the voluntary participants were evaluated. Taking into consideration the participants' dietary habits and health status, an appropriate dietary plan (55-60% carbohydrates, 15-20 protein%, 25-30% fat) was prepared. RESULTS: The anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and biochemical parameters of overweight and obese individuals who received dietary counseling and home-delivered diet services were evaluated before and after the diet. In both groups, cardiometabolic risk factors were found to decrease. It was determined that those who received the home-delivered diet service had a greater reduction in body weight, Body Mass Index values, body fat percentages, and waist circumferences compared to those who received dietary counseling (P < 0.001). Similarly, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, and blood pressure values were found to decrease more significantly in individuals receiving the home-delivered diet service (P < 0.001). Additionally, both groups showed an increase in High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, with a greater increase observed in those receiving the home-delivered diet service (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this study, participants who received the home-delivered diet service, which is particularly beneficial for individuals who struggle with healthy meal preparation and portion control, exhibited better adherence to medical nutrition therapy and experienced a greater reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors compared to those who received dietary counseling."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although combining a low-protein diet (LPD) with oral nutritional supplements increases treatment adherence and nutritional status in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the effect of this combination approach in older adults remains unclear. This study examined the impact of a 6% low-protein formula (6% LPF) with diet counseling in older adults with stage 3-5 CKD. METHODS: In this three-month randomized controlled study, 66 patients (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, non-dialysis, over 65 years of age) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (LPD plus a 6% LPF) or control group (LPD alone). The 6% LPF comprised 400 kcal, 6 g of protein, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and various micronutrients. All data were collected at baseline and after three months, including physical performance based on hand grip strength (HGS) and gait speed, nutritional status using Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) scores, body composition through bioelectrical impedance analysis, and dietary intake from 24-h dietary records. RESULTS: This study incorporated 47 participants (median age, 73; median eGFR, 36 ml/min/1.73 m2; intervention group: 24; control group: 23). The intervention group exhibited significant differences in HGS and gait speed, and micronutrient analysis revealed significantly higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), EPA, DHA, calcium, iron, zinc, copper, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, B6, B12, and folic acid intake than the control group. MNA-SF scores, macronutrient intake, and body composition did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to LPD counseling alone, an LPD prescription with 6% LPF in older adults with CKD stages 3-5 helped relieve physical deterioration and increased micronutrient intake after three months.

Obese subjects were counseled on adequate energy intake. Blood sampling, anthropometric measurements, dietary surveys, and 24-h urine collection were performed at baseline and at 6 months. Serum uric acid (S-UA) levels were significantly lower at 6 months compared to baseline. Water intake and urine volume were considerably higher at 6 months than at baseline. When compared to baseline, urine UA (U-UA) levels were significantly lower, and renal fractional excretion of UA (FEUA) was significantly higher at 6 months. Changes in renal function (serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and FEUA) were significantly associated with ?S-UA level. In this study, S-UA level was significantly decreased by dietary counseling in line with the guideline. This study illustrates the effectiveness of dietary counseling for asymptomatic hyperuricemia.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, the supporting evidence for dietary counseling is insufficient. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of individualized dietary counseling on nutritional outcomes and quality of life (QOL) in patients undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. METHODS: This study was a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial. The patients after surgery for gastric cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention group and the control group. In the intervention group, patients receive individualized dietary counseling based on individual calorie needs and symptom assessment at 24 h before discharge, 14, 21, 30, and 60 days postoperatively. Patients in the control group received routine dietary counseling. The primary endpoint was body mass index (BMI) loss at 30, 60, and 90 days after surgery; the secondary endpoints were calorie and protein intake at 30 and 60 days after surgery, blood parameters, the 90-day readmission rate, and QOL at 90 days after surgery. RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were enrolled; 67 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 63 patients to the control group. Compared with the control group, patients in the intervention group were significantly less BMI loss at 30 days (-0.84 ± 0.65 vs. -1.29 ± 0.83), 60 days (-1.29 ± 0.92 vs. -1.77 ± 1.13), and 90 days (-1.37 ± 1.05 vs. -1.92 ± 1.66) after surgery (all P< 0.05). Subgroups analysis by surgery type showed that the intervention could significantly reduce BMI loss in patients undergoing total and proximal gastrectomy at 30 days (-0.75 ± 0.47 vs. -1.55 ± 1.10), 60 days (-1.59 ± 1.02 vs. -2.55 ± 1.16), and 90 days (-1.44 ± 1.19 vs. -3.26 ± 1.46) after surgery (all P< 0.05). At 60 days after surgery, calorie goals were reached in 35 patients (77.8%) in the intervention group and 14 patients (40.0%) in the control group (P = 0.001), and protein goals were reached in 40 patients (88.9%) in the intervention group and 17 patients (48.6%) in the control group (P< 0.001). Regarding the QOL at 90 days after surgery, the patients in the intervention group had a significantly lower level of fatigue, shortness of breath and stomach pain, better physical function, and cognitive function (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Post-discharge individualized dietary counseling is an effective intervention to reduce post-gastrectomy patient weight loss and to elevate calorie intake, protein intake, and QOL."

Additionally, we explored relationships between nutritional status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The dietary intervention aimed to achieve a protein intake of 1.5 g/kg/day and reduce nutrition-impact symptoms. Patients received dietary counseling 4 weeks prior to surgery (prehabilitation group); the rehabilitation group just before surgery. We used 3-day food journals to calculate protein intake and the abridged Patient-generated Subjective Global Assessment questionnaire (aPG-SGA) to determine nutritional status. We utilized the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General questionnaire to measure HRQoL. Sixty-one patients participated in the study (30 = prehabilitation). Dietary counseling achieved a significant increase in preoperative protein intake (+0.3 ± 0.1 g/kg/day, P = 0.007), with no change in the rehabilitation group. Dietary counseling did not mitigate a significant increase in aPG-SGA postoperatively (prehabilitation: +5.8 ± 1.0; rehabilitation: +3.3 ± 1.0; P < 0.05). aPG-SGA was predictive of HRQoL (β = -1.77, P < 0.0001). HRQoL remained unchanged in both groups over the study period. Dietary counseling within a HPB prehabilitation program improves preoperative protein intake, but not aPG-SGA, which is predictive of HRQoL. Future studies should examine whether specialized medical management of nutrition-impact symptoms would improve HRQoL outcomes within a prehabilitation model.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nutrition support is associated with improved survival and nonelective hospital readmission rates among malnourished medical inpatients; however, limited evidence supporting dietary counseling is available. We intend to determine the effect of dietary counseling with or without oral nutrition supplementation (ONS), compared with standard care, on hospitalized adults who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for studies listed from January 1, 2011, to August 31, 2021. Meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs to estimate the effect. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were identified. Compared with standard care, dietary counseling with or without ONS probably does not reduce inpatient rates of 30-day mortality (RR = 1.24; 0.60-2.55; I2  = 45%; P = 0.56; moderate certainty), slightly reduces 6-month mortality (RR = 0.83; 0.69-1.00; I2  = 16%; P = 0.06; high certainty), reduces complications (RR = 0.85; 0.73-0.98; I2  = 0%; P = 0.03; high certainty), and may slightly reduce readmission (RR = 0.83; 0.66-1.03; I2  = 55%; P = 0.10; low certainty) but may not reduce length of stay (mean difference: -0.75 days; -1.66-0.17; I2  = 70%; P = 0.11; low certainty). Intervention may result in slight improvements in nutrition status/intake and weight/body mass index (low certainty). CONCLUSIONS: There is an increase in the certainty of evidence regarding the positive impact of dietary counseling on outcomes. Future studies should standardize and provide details/frequencies of counseling methods and ONS adherence to determine dietary counseling effectiveness.",

The effect of a dietary intervention in the first year of life on global methylation levels in leukocyte samples from a cohort of children born between 2001 and 2002 in southern Brazil was examined. Overall methylation measurements were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on DNA samples from 237 children at 4 years old. Mean methylation values were higher in the intervention group (mean: 2.20 ± 1.31%) than in the control group (mean: 1.65 ± 1.11%; P = 0.001). It was observed that nutritional counseling in the first year increased breastfeeding duration and stimulated the development of healthier eating habits. Therefore, these factors might have contributed to increase global DNA methylation. The findings of the present study reinforce the notion that performing nutritional interventions in the early stages of life is important and provide further evidence of the interaction between the environment and epigenetic traits."

Patients with GDM should receive dietary counseling regarding diet and exercise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study patients' perception level of diet and their level of understanding after dietary counseling, we analyzed 225 reports of dietary counseling of patients with GDM prepared by dieticians. We also assessed the patients' level of understanding after dietary counseling by asking questions regarding the counseling content. The answers to the questions were aggregated, and substantially similar answers were grouped and categorized. RESULTS: The dieticians' suggestions were well understood by the patients. Moreover, the patients also identified their previous incorrect eating habits, such as excessive carbohydrate restriction or inappropriate fruit intake. Although distributed frequent meals were recommended by the dieticians, few patients actually practiced this for various reasons. Some patients were apparently influenced by dietary information from the mass media. CONCLUSION: Dietary counseling was regarded as helpful and acceptable to most patients with GDM in our hospital, and many suggestions were recognized as informative for modification of previous dietary habits. By providing the results of the questionnaire survey to the dieticians, they can improve the quality of their counseling, which is expected to result in better individual care of the patients."

The combination of lifestyle interventions with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation could have a synergetic effect on maternal and offspring outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of docosahexaenoic acid supplementation among obese and overweight pregnant women (independently or combined with a dietary counseling intervention) on metabolic control in mothers and their offspring. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a randomized controlled trial with a 2×2 factorial design. The following inclusion criteria were used: <15 weeks of gestation; body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 at the first prenatal visit; singleton pregnancy; and 18 years of age or older. The recruited women (n=1002) were randomly allocated to 1 of the 4 parallel groups: Group 1: dietary counseling plus 800 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid (n=250); Group 2: routine counseling plus 800 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid (n=252); Group 3: dietary counseling plus 200 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid (n=249); and Group 4: routine counseling plus 200 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid (n=251), considered as the reference group. The dietary intervention comprised 3 sessions, and it was focused on reducing the consumption of foods that most contributed to daily sugar intake. Primary outcomes were gestational diabetes mellitus defined according to the national guidelines; macrosomia (birthweight >4000 g); and neonatal insulin resistance (cord blood Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance ≥2.60), which was assessed in a subsample of 226 newborns. The analysis was by intention to treat and by efficacy. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02574767). RESULTS: The overall incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus was 20.2% (Group 1, 21.0%; Group 2, 20.1%; Group 3, 18.9%; and Group 4, 20.9%). Mean birthweight was 3403.0 g (standard deviation, 575.3), and the incidence of macrosomia was 11.9% (Group 1, 13.2%; Group 2, 10.8%; Group 3, 11.5%; and Group 4, 12.1%). Median cord blood Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance was 0.9 (interquartile range, 0.6-1.7), and 10.2% showed cord blood insulin resistance (Group 1, 12.0%; Group 2, 12.0%; Group 3, 9.7%; and Group 4, 5.1%). No significant differences were found among groups regarding primary outcomes (P<.05). Glucose concentrations in the cord blood samples were lower in those adherents to the docosahexaenoic acid supplementation (P<.05). CONCLUSION: For women who were overweight or obese at the beginning of pregnancy, this combined intervention did not reduce the risk of gestational diabetes in mothers or macrosomia and insulin resistance in neonates.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Excessive intake of sodium is a dietary risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Currently, intake of sodium is much higher than the recommended level in most western countries, and effective strategies to reduce population sodium intake are lacking. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of two different sodium reduction strategies on the intake of sodium, potassium, and the sodium to potassium ratio among Danish families SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study was a 4-month, single-blinded, cluster randomized controlled trial with a parallel design. Eighty-nine healthy Danish families, with a minimum of one child and one parent (n = 309), were randomly assigned to receive sodium-reduced bread (Intervention A), sodium-reduced bread and dietary counseling (Intervention B) or regular sodium bread (Control). The primary outcome was change in daily sodium intake, measured by 24-h urinary sodium excretion. Secondary outcomes included changes in dietary potassium and the sodium to potassium ratio. RESULTS: No significant differences in daily sodium intake were observed in the two intervention groups compared with the control. When analyzing the results separately for children and adults, a reduction in dietary sodium of 0.6 g/day (-1.0, -0.2), p = 0.005 occurred among adults in intervention B compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that providing sodium-reduced bread in combination with dietary counseling is an effective strategy to reduce dietary sodium among adults, but the effect is lacking in children. The study was not able to show significant effects when providing sodium-reduced bread alone in neither adults nor children.",

The assessments were conducted at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after intervention. RESULTS: Mean age and body mass index (BMI) Z-score were 14.5 ± 1.2 and 2.42 ± 0.62, respectively. Considering time trend analysis, the two groups achieved significant improvements in BMI Z-score, wrist and waist circumferences, body composition indices, and HRQoL total scores after a one-year follow-up. Wrist circumference and the HRQoL reported by parents revealed significant differences between the study groups in favor of the motivation-based program. CONCLUSIONS: Although both programs could improve anthropometric indices and HRQoL over time, the motivation-based program was more effective in reducing adolescents' wrist circumference and improving HRQoL, as the parents reported."

      "abstract": "The current state of knowledge related to diet in Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is far from satisfactory, as many HT subjects experience several disorders and report reduced quality of life. There are three aims of the study: (1) to develop a qualitative dietary protocol (QDP; 'Diet4Hashi') as a simple, graphic-text tool dedicated to TH subjects, (2) to evaluate the use of the QDP in dietetic counseling compared to conventional dietetic counseling (CDC) in HT women, and (3) to assess the impact of both the QDP and the CDC on the diet quality, quality of life, adiposity, and metabolic parameters of HT women. The QDP is based on subject self-monitoring supported with a graphic-text tool to help them in food selection and adequate food frequency consumption, while the CDC on oral explanation and printed sample menus were provided by a dietician. The QDP contains two lists: (A) foods recommended for consumption and (B) foods with limited consumption, along with indicated consumption frequency per day/week/month. Both approaches include the same dietary recommendations for HT extracted from the literature but differ in subject-dietician cooperation. To summarize the evidence regarding dietary recommendations in HT, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases (to March 2019) and the bibliographies of key articles were searched. The study is designed as a dietary intervention lasting six months in two parallel groups: experimental and control. In the experimental group, the QDP will be applied, while in the control group, the CDC will be applied. In total, the study will include a baseline of 100 women with diagnosed HT. The subjects will be randomly allocated into the experimental/control groups (50/50). Data related to diet quality and other lifestyle factors, nutrition knowledge, quality of life, thyroid function, body composition, blood pressure, serum fasting glucose, and lipid profile at baseline and after a six-month follow-up will be collected. This study was conducted to develop a dietary protocol (Diet4Hashi) that is easy to follow for HT subjects, and it will contribute to providing valuable data that are useful to dieticians and physicians. It is anticipated that this graphic-text qualitative dietary protocol, by improving food selection and diet quality, may reduce adiposity and improve metabolic parameters and the quality of life of HT women.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is common and associated with poor prognosis. Nutrition interventions are necessary, but there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of tailored nutrition advice. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether tailored nutrition counseling could improve dietary intake, nutritional status, functional outcomes, and health-related quality of life (QoL) of malnourished outpatients with COPD. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: One hundred and twenty malnourished outpatients with COPD participated in the study between May and November 2017 at the National Lung Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. INTERVENTION: The IG received tailored nutrition counseling once per month for 3 months based on a specifically developed written nutrition resource for COPD. The CG received the same educational resource at baseline without any discussion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were energy and protein intakes, body weight change, nutritional status (Subjective Global Assessment score), muscle strength, and QoL. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Differences between groups before and after the intervention were assessed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Generalized estimating equation modeling was used to investigate the differences between groups over time. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences in outcomes of interest between the two groups. After 3 months of intervention, time-intervention interactions for energy intake, protein intake, and body weight change were significant (945 kcal/day, 95% CI 792 to 1,099 kcal/day, P<0.001; 50.0 g protein/day, 95% CI 43.9 to 56.1 g protein/day, P<0.001; and 1.0 kg, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.5 kg, P<0.001, respectively). Subjective Global Assessment scores improved in the IG and worsened in the CG. Significant improvements were found in inspiratory muscle strength in the IG (5.4 cmH2O, 95% CI 2.3 to 8.6 cmH2O, P=0.001) and significant decreases in handgrip strength were found in the CG after 3 months of the intervention (1.4 kg, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.4 kg, P=0.007). There was a significant interaction effect for all QoL scores (analysis of variance two-way repeated, P≤0.003). The IG also significantly improved all QoL scores from baseline to 3 months (P<0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Tailored nutritional counseling has the potential to improve dietary intakes, nutritional status, functional outcomes, and QoL in malnourished outpatients with COPD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE(S): Although healthy dietary patterns are associated with decreased mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), few patients receive dietitian counseling due to concerns such as dietitian availability, travel distance, and cost. Our objective was to determine the feasibility of dietary smartphone application-supported telecounseling to reduce sodium intake and improve dietary quality in patients with early CKD. METHODS: This was a pre-post, mixed methods feasibility study of 16 patients with Stage 1-3a CKD in central/northeast Pennsylvania. Patients recorded and shared dietary data via smartphone applications with registered dietitians, who used motivational interviewing to provide telephone counseling weekly for 8 weeks. Seven patients were assigned to a customized study-specific application and nine patients to a commercially available, free application (MyFitnessPal). Participant satisfaction was assessed via survey, and participants were invited to complete a semistructured interview. Outcomes assessed included sodium intake, Healthy Eating Index 2015 score, weight, and 24-hour blood pressure (BP). RESULTS: Mean age was 64.7 years, 31% were female, 100% were white, 13% had income <$25,000. Adherence was excellent with 14 (88%) entering dietary data at least 75% of total days. Patients reported high satisfaction with the intervention and dietitian telecounseling. Use of dietary apps was viewed positively for allowing tracking of sodium and energy intake although some participants experienced functionality issues with the customized application that were not generally experienced by those using the commercially available free application. Sodium intake (-604 mg/day, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1,104 to -104), Healthy Eating Index 2015 score (3.97, 95% CI: 0.03-7.91), weight (-3.4, 95% CI: -6.6 to -0.1), daytime systolic BP (-5.8, 95% CI: -12.1 to 0.6), and daytime diastolic BP (-4.1, 95% CI: -7.9 to -0.2) improved after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: An application-supported telecounseling program with a registered dietitian appears to be a feasible and well-accepted strategy to improve dietary quality and improve cardiovascular risk factors in patients with early kidney disease.",

METHODS: Randomized study of two groups: dietary counseling (Intervention Group: IG) and routine counseling (Control Group: CG). The intervention consisted of three educational sessions focused on decreasing intake of foods that most contribute to sugars consumption. Changes in sugars and energy consumption were evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire before and after the intervention. RESULTS: We evaluated 433 pregnant women, 272 in IG and 161 in CG, who before intervention had a mean consumption of 140 g total sugars and 2134 kcal energy per day. At the end of the intervention, the IG showed 15 g/day lower consumption of total sugars (95% CI: -25 and -5 g/day), 2% less total energy from sugars (95% CI: -3% and -1% g/day), and 125 kcal/day less energy than the CG (95% CI: -239 and -10 kcal/day). Table sugar, sweets, and soft drinks had the greatest reduction in consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention focused on counseling on the decrease in consumption of the foods that most contribute to sugars consumption in overweight and obese pregnant women was effective in decreasing total sugars and energy consumption, mainly in the food groups high in sugars.

Recent developments in antiemetic drugs have substantially improved CINV, but nutritional intervention did not improve body weight. This study aimed to investigate the effects of nutrition intervention with appropriate antiemetic treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer during chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients received individualized nutrition counseling by a registered dietitian and were provided with oral supplements for 90 days. Body weight and other parameters were measured at baseline and after 90-day intervention. To evaluate this nutrition intervention, patients were also retrospectively set as control, and then body weight change was compared with inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) analysis. RESULTS: Ten patients received individualized nutrition counseling and were provided with oral supplements for 90 days. Of them, 7 patients consumed nutritional supplements, and the mean intake was 130 kcal/day. After 90-day intervention, the patients did not show significant weight and BMI loss during the course of cytotoxic chemotherapy. A total of 38 patients were retrospectively enrolled as controls. The number of the patients who gain the body weight after 90 days in the study cohort was significantly larger than that in the retrospective controls with the IPTW analysis (Odds Ratio (OR) = 8.4; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.6-42; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Early intensive nutrition intervention with appropriate antiemetic treatment prevents weight loss. Nutrition interventions might be also beneficial for quality of life, treatment response and survival."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer, in particular breast cancer, is one of the leading causes of death among women. Good nutritional status contributes to the efficacy of treatment and recovery, and nutritional interventions can minimize the adverse effects of cancer therapy. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the potential role of dietary counseling in breast cancer patients. The impact of nutritional advice on the nutritional status of patients, the use of dietary supplements, and the knowledge of phytoestrogens were assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted between April and July 2016 in the Lublin Oncology Center on a group of 173 female patients undergoing breast cancer treatment. The patients filled out a questionnaire containing 34 open-ended and closed-ended questions. The collected data were processed in Excel and Statistica 5.0 programs, and the results were regarded as significant at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the evaluated patients was 66.8 ± 11.3 years. The duration of disease was significantly correlated with the patients' nutritional status expressed by the body mass index (P = 0.0368). The main sources of knowledge about nutrition in cancer care were nurses (29.71%), physicians (12.31%), and nutritionists (13.78%). Patients who received nutritional advice had significantly greater knowledge about phytoestrogens (P = 0.0001), and they were of the opinion that a diet rich in phytoestrogens was safe (P = 0.001). More than 85% of the polled subjects used dietary supplements during treatment, and 2/3 of them did so without professional advice. In this study, 73.07% of the respondents regularly monitored their body weight. Patients who did not receive dietary advice less frequently informed their physician about weight changes. CONCLUSIONS: The nutritional status of patients was correlated with access to nutrition and dietary advice during illness. The risk of malnutrition was minimized when patients received and understood educational materials. The patients who did not receive dietary advice more frequently overdosed on dietary supplements. Phytoestrogens were more widely used by patients who regularly attended a dietitian.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lifestyle interventions are the primary prevention strategy for gestational diabetes (GDM) in obese/overweight women; however, these interventions have shown limited effectiveness. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) intake has shown beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, lipid fractions and inflammatory factors in women who already have GDM. Combining PUFAs supplementation with a lifestyle intervention could achieve lower increase of glucose levels by improving insulin sensitivity. Our aim is to assess two prenatal nutritional interventions (home-based dietary counseling and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation) delivered to obese/overweight women during pregnancy for them and their offspring to achieve better metabolic control. METHODS/DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, 2 × 2 factorial design. Eligible pregnant women will be randomly allocated to one of the four parallel arms: 1) Home-based dietary counseling +800 mg/day DHA supplementation (n = 250); 2) 800 mg/day DHA (n = 250); 3) Home-based dietary counseling +200 mg/day DHA (n = 250); 4) 200 mg/day DHA (n = 250). Primary outcomes are: GDM; macrosomia; and neonatal insulin resistance. Data analyses will be done on an intention-to-treat basis. DISCUSSION: We expect the present study to contribute to the understanding of the potential effectiveness of an omega-3 supplementation on the risk of developing GDM in overweight/obese pregnant women. We will also test if the combination of having better dietary habits alongside with omega 3 supplementation will improve insulin sensitivity and as consequence, a lower elevation of glucose levels could be achieved.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the effects of repeated, infancy-onset dietary counseling on a detailed metabolic profile. Effects of dietary saturated fat replacement on circulating concentrations of metabolic biomarkers still remain unknown. STUDY DESIGN: The Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project (STRIP) study is a longitudinal, randomized atherosclerosis prevention trial in which repeated dietary counseling aimed at reducing the proportion of saturated fat intake. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics quantified circulating metabolites from serum samples assessed at age 9 (n = 554), 11 (n = 553), 13 (n = 508), 15 (n = 517), 17 (n = 457), and 19 (n = 417) years. RESULTS: The intervention reduced dietary intake of saturated fat (mean difference in daily percentage of total energy intake: -2.1 [95% CI -1.9 to -2.3]) and increased intake of polyunsaturated fat (0.6 [0.5-0.7]). The dietary counseling intervention led to greater serum proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids (P < .001), with greater proportions of both circulating omega-3 (P = .02) and omega-6 (P < .001) fatty acids. The proportion of saturated fatty acids in serum was lower for both boys and girls in the intervention group (P < .001), whereas the serum proportion of monounsaturated fat was lower for boys in the intervention group only (P < .001). The intervention also reduced circulating intermediate-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein lipid concentrations (P < .01). Dietary intervention effects on nonlipid biomarkers were minor except from greater concentrations of glutamine in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated dietary counseling from infancy to early adulthood yielded favorable effects on multiple circulating fatty acids and lipoprotein subclass lipids, particularly in boys. These molecular effects substantiate the beneficial role of saturated fat replacement on the metabolic risk profile. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00223600.",

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of dietary counseling on EGWG. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled intervention trial. METHODS: The study was conducted at the antenatal care (ANC) clinic, Center for Social and Preventive Medicine, Pediatrics Hospital, Cairo University, during the period from July 2015 to April 2016. A total of 200 primigravidae aged between 20 and 30 years were included and randomized into intervention and control groups. Based on data analysis from phase 1, nutritional practices of the studied participants were identified and tailored nutrition counseling sessions designed. Follow-up of the studied participants throughout ANC visits was done to enforce the healthy dietary intake and encourage weight gain according to the recommendations to avoid EGWG. RESULTS: The intervention resulted in a significantly higher proportion of women in the intervention group who gained gestational weight within the Institute of Medicine recommendations compared to women in the control group (42.7% vs 13.9%, respectively) (P-value <0.001); this was detected between the 25th and 35th weeks of gestation. Dietary counseling had significantly improved the frequency of consumption of different food items and knowledge, attitude, and practice mean scores of the intervention group in comparison with the control group (P-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrated that dietary counseling given to pregnant women reduced the proportion of EGWG and improved dietary practices. There is a strong need for effective intervention strategies targeting EGWG to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of obesity surgery on serum and adipose tissue fatty acid (FA) profile and FA metabolism may modify the risk of obesity-related diseases. METHODS: We measured serum (n=122) and adipose tissue (n=24) FA composition and adipose tissue mRNA expression of genes regulating FA metabolism (n=100) in participants of the Kuopio Obesity Surgery Study (KOBS, age 47.2±8.7 years, BMI 44.6±6.0, 40 men, 82 women) before and one year after obesity surgery. As part of the surgery protocol, all the subjects were instructed to add sources of unsaturated fatty acids, such as rapeseed oil and fatty fish, into their diet. The results were compared with changes in serum FA composition in 122 subjects from the Finnish Diabetes Prevention study (DPS) (age 54.3±7.1 years, BMI 32.2±4.6, 28 men, 94 women). RESULTS: The proportion of saturated FAs decreased and the proportion of n-3 and n-6 FAs increased in serum triglycerides after obesity surgery (all P<0.002). Weight loss predicted changes in quantitative amounts of saturated FAs, monounsaturated FAs, n-3 and n-6 FAs in triglycerides (P<0.002 for all). Moreover, the changes in adipose tissue FAs reflected the changes in serum FAs, and some of the changes were associated with mRNA expression of elongases and desaturases in adipose tissue (all P<0.05). In line with this the estimated activity of elongase (18:1 n-7/16:1 n-7) increased significantly after obesity surgery in all lipid fractions (all P<4 × 10-7) and the increase in the estimated activity of D5D in triglycerides was associated with higher weight loss (r=0.415, P<2 × 10-6). Changes in serum FA profile were similar after obesity surgery and lifestyle intervention, except for the change in the absolute amounts of n-3 FAs between the two studies (P=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Beneficial changes in serum and adipose tissue FAs after obesity surgery could be associated with changes in endogenous metabolism and diet.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the combined effect of complete denture renewal and simple dietary advice. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed with edentulous patients who required new complete dentures. All participants received complete denture treatment. In addition, the intervention group received dietary advice in a pamphlet form, while the control group received advice pertaining to the care and maintenance of the dentures. The advice was given by dentists for each group. The participants' food intake was assessed at baseline and 3 months after intervention using a diet history questionnaire and an oral health related quality of life assessment measured using the Japanese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous people (OHIP-EDENT-J). RESULTS: Among 70 participants who were randomized, 62 participants finished all parts of this trial. At baseline, there was no significant difference in the food intake between the two groups. At the 3-month assessment, the intervention group showed significantly greater intake of chicken (P=0.013), fish with bones (P=0.012), and carrots and pumpkins (P=0.025) compared to the control group. However, at baseline and at the 3-month assessment, there was no significant difference in the OHIP-EDENT-J scores between the groups, but the OHIP-EDENT-J scores significantly improved for both groups at the 3-month assessment. There were more significant improved dimensions of OHIP-EDENT-J in the intervention group than in the control group at the 3-month assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Simple dietary advice combined with complete denture treatment could improve food intake of edentulous patients. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present study suggests that brief dietary advice provided by dentists can improve food intake of edentulous elderly. This simply diet advice is much easier compared to customized forms, might enable normal dentists provide patients it. The result of this study broadens possibility of nutritional counseling in daily clinical practice.",

DESIGN: Non-randomised controlled study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 224 home care clients (≥ 75 years) (intervention group, n = 127; control group, n = 100) who were at protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) or risk of PEM (MNA score <24 and plasma albumin <35 g/L). INTERVENTION: Individually tailored dietary counseling; the persons were instructed to increase their food intake with energy-dense food items, the number of meals they ate and their consumption of energy-, protein- and nutrient-rich snacks for six months. MEASUREMENTS: The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Body Mass Index (BMI) and plasma albumin were used to determine nutritional status at the baseline and after the six-month intervention. RESULTS: The mean age of the home care clients was 84.3 (SD 5.5) in the intervention group and 84.4 (SD 5.3) in the control group, and 70 percent were women in both groups. After the six-month nutritional intervention, the MNA score increased 2.3 points and plasma albumin 1.6 g/L in the intervention group, against MNA score decreased -0.2 points and plasma albumin -0.1 g/L in the control group.

OBJECTIVE: Identify the degree of adherence to dietary counseling and predictors of adherence among patients undergoing tuberculosis treatment. DESIGN: Observational prospective follow-up study conducted in adults treating for tuberculosis with or without HIV. Self-reported adherence and 24-h diet recall were checked. Diet counseling according to WHO strategy was offered at each visit for all patients. The endpoint was the adherence to the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and total calories consumed during tuberculosis treatment. Data were mainly analyzed with marginal models to estimate adjusted trajectories. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included in the study. The maximum probability of total calories consumption of at least one RDA was 80%. The adherence to dietary counseling was low regardless of HIV infection. The negative determinants of adherence were the presence of loss of appetite and nausea/vomiting. For patients with loss of appetite and nausea/vomiting, the probability of total calories consumption of at least one RDA is less than 20% at any time. CONCLUSION: The loss of appetite and nausea/vomiting are highly prevalents and were the main causes of non-adherence to dietary counseling.",

We investigated changes in metabolic syndrome (MetS) components and homeostasis assessment model insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in smokers given dietary counseling during their quit attempt. METHODS AND RESULTS: Smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day) with BMI 25-40 kg/m2 were randomized to a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet and treated with a standard course of varenicline for 12 weeks. Quitters were assessed according to the Russell standard (≤5 cigarettes after the quit date) validated with expired breath carbon monoxide (CO) < 10 ppm. Of 122 randomized participants, 108 (89%) completed clinical and laboratory assessments at 12 weeks. As changes in metabolic risk factors did not differ between dietary groups, we combined the groups to compare quitters to continuing smokers. We found similar weight change among 78 validated quitters as 30 continuing smokers (-0.1 ± 3.0 kg vs 0.3 ± 3.1 kg; p = 0.7) and change in waist circumference (-2.0 ± 3.8 cm vs -0.9 ± 3.9 cm; p = 0.2). Changes in triglyceride concentrations (-0.16 ± 0.52 mmol/l vs 0.21 ± 0.95 mmol/l; p = 0.015) and diastolic blood pressure (-0.9 ± 6 mmHg vs 1.9 ± 8 mmHg; p = 0.039) were more favorable in quitters. Changes in other cardiometabolic risks and HOMA-IR did not differ between quitters and continuous smokers, nor did energy intake or resting metabolic rate. CONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia and blood pressure improved and no early weight gain was seen in quitters, suggesting that dietary intervention can mitigate some of the effects of stopping smoking on cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese smokers.

RESULTS: In the intervention group (IG), 92% vs 76% in the HIG reached >75% of energy requirements ( P = .04); 90% in the IG vs 66% in the HIG reached >75% of protein requirements ( p = <0.01). The IG had a significantly higher mean intake of energy and protein compared with the HIG: ABW, 31 kcal kg-1 vs 25 kcal kg-1 ( P < .01) and 1.2 g protein kg-1 vs 0.9 g protein kg-1 ( P < .001). More than 85% of the patients with a baseline <50% of the EP requirement achieved ≥75% of the energy and protein requirement. No difference between readmission rates was found. CONCLUSION: Providing a protein-enriched menu in conjunction with individualized dietary counseling significantly increased protein and energy intake in hospitalized patients at nutrition risk.",

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of dietary counseling for regular foods consumption on nutritional outcomes in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective randomized study was performed on locally advanced unresectable or metastatic cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at Department of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, between December 2013 and July 2014. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to dietary counseling group and routine care group. The dietary counseling was performed by a dietitian before starting chemotherapy. Outcomes were evaluated at the end of three to four cycles and six to eight cycles of chemotherapy or after two months if the chemotherapy was stopped earlier. RESULTS: The dietary counseling group significantly increased percent change of body weight 2.29 (±6.20) vs. -1.70 (±6.23) percent in the routine care group, p = 0.03 and increased BMI 2.27 (±6.09) vs. -1.53 (±5.92) percent, p = 0.03 at the end of three to four cycles of chemotherapy, but there was no significant change at the next two months. Furthermore, PG-SGA score was lower in the dietary counseling group (6.67 (±1.99) vs. 10.04 (±3.73), p<0.001, and quality of life was significant increased in dietary counseling group at the end of three to four cycles of chemotherapy and at the next two months (score 39.40 (±10.61) vs 46.16 (±7.55), p = 0.01). Absolute lymphocyte count, serum albumin, energy intake, number of patients who delayed chemotherapy, cause of delay chemotherapy, and number of total cycles did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: Dietary counseling have significantly improved body weight, BMI, PG-SGA scores, and quality of life scores in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy compared with routine care. We should be concerned about screening for malnutrition in all cancer patients and we should provide nutritional counseling.",

METHODS: Thirty-five obese adults (26 women; age: 39.2 ± 13.4 years, body mass, BM: 104.1 ± 18.7 kg and body mass index, BMI: 38.3 ± 6.6 kg m-2) followed a walking program (instructions were provided so that the participants increase their walking distance by 1000 steps each week, until to perform at least 10,000 steps per day) and received qualitative dietary advice (cookbook presenting numerous recipes with low calories and dietary advices was provided) for 6 months. Before and after the intervention, anthropometric (BM, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, fat mass: FM and lean body mass: LBM) and biological data (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride and glucose concentrations), REE and HRQoL (including eight dimensions and two summaries) were assessed. RESULTS: After the intervention, BM (difference: 3.8 kg or 3.7 %), BMI (difference: 1.4 kg m-2 or 3.7 %), hip circumference (difference: 4.6 cm or 4.3 %), FM in kg (difference: 4.0 kg or 8.9 %) and FM in percentage of BM (difference: 1.6 kg or 6.1 %) were significantly decreased, whereas number of steps (difference: 7579 steps or 135 %), LBM in percentage of BM (difference: 2.6 kg or 4.5 %) and REE (difference: 78 kcal d-1 or 4.8 %) were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Moreover, two HRQoL subdimension scores (physical functioning and physical component summary; increase by 15.3 and 4.6, respectively, p < 0.05) and anxiety (reduction by 1.2, p < 0.05) were also significantly improved. Conversely, the biological data showed no significant change (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Walking 10,000 steps per day in association with dietary counseling improved anthropometric data, REE, the physical domains of HRQoL and anxiety in obese adults.",

This pilot study tested the feasibility and acceptability of delivering an intensive nutrition intervention for lung cancer patients receiving RT. Twenty-four patients with lung cancer were randomized to receive the intervention which employed a care pathway to guide intensive dietary counseling from pretreatment until 6-wk posttreatment or usual care. Nutritional, fatigue, and functional outcomes were assessed using valid and reliable questionnaires before randomization, at the start and end of RT and 1- and 3-mo post-RT. Consent rate was 57% with an overall attrition of 37%. Subject compliance with the completion of study questionnaires was 100%. A clinically important mean difference indicated greater overall satisfaction with nutritional care in the intervention group (5.00, interquartile range [IQR] 4.50-5.00; 4.00, IQR 4.00-4.00). Clinically important differences favoring the intervention were observed for weight (3.0 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8, 6.8), fat-free mass (0.6 kg; 95% CI -2.1, 3.3), physical well-being (2.1; 95% CI -2.3, 6.5), and functional well-being (5.1; 95% CI 1.6, 8.6), but all 95% CIs were wide and most included zero. Recruitment feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were demonstrated, which suggest larger trials using an intensive nutrition intervention would be achievable.",

At the Odette Cancer Centre, there is currently no protocol or guideline for radiation therapists (RTs) to refer patients to registered dietitians before or during treatment. The aim of our study was to determine if RTs across Canada were able to identify and/or recognize nutrition-related side effects in patients during their course of radiation treatment who would require/benefit from a referral to a registered dietitian for additional support. An e-mail invitation with a link to an electronic questionnaire was distributed to RTs across Canada. Overall, 137 RTs responded (11% response rate) from across the country. Most respondents practice as treatment delivery therapists (75%). Seventy-five percent indicated that they were asked for advice on nutrition-related issues by patients. Self-assessment revealed RTs are more knowledgeable than confident in both recognizing patients requiring nutrition intervention and providing proper care. Analysis of open-ended questions indicates that RTs are knowledgeable in recognizing and providing appropriate interventions to patients. As RTs are positioned to be the first line to screen patients, they can provide quick and easy access to information and interventions in addition to making patient referrals to dietitians for additional support. To improve their confidence, educational sessions can be held with proper referral algorithms made available to RTs. This will provide better quality of care and improve the continuity of care, leading to improved patient care with better patient outcomes."

Dietary counseling during treatment has positive effects on nutritional status and quality of life, however, the effects of dietary counseling started before initiation of treatment are currently unknown. Therefore we assessed the effect of early individualized dietary counseling (DC) on weight loss, major complications, and length of hospital stay (LOS) in patients with HNC. Ninety-five newly diagnosed HNC patients with (risk of) undernutrition receiving DC were compared to 95 matched HNC patients receiving usual nutritional care (UC). Difference in weight change over time was analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE). Differences in complications and LOS were studied by Pearson chi-squared and student's t-tests. Weight change between diagnosis and end of treatment was -6.0 ± 6.9% (DC) and -5.4 ± 5.7% (UC; GEE: -0.4kg, 95% confidence interval: -1.2 to 0.5; P = 0.44). Less DC patients experienced overall postoperative complications (44%/70%, P = 0.04). No effect on major postoperative or (chemo)radiotherapy complications or LOS was found. This study showed a lower prevalence of overall postoperative complications in HNC patients receiving DC but could not demonstrate an effect on weight loss, other complications, and LOS.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The Brazilian Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend dietary counseling for patients with malnutrition during tuberculosis treatment. Patients under tuberculosis therapy (infected and not infected with HIV) were followed-up to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary counseling. OBJECTIVE: describe the nutritional status of patients with tuberculosis. METHODS: an observational follow-up study over a 180-day period of tuberculosis therapy in adults was conducted. Subjects were assessed for body composition (using BMI, TSF and MUAC parameters), serum biomarkers and offered dietary counseling. The data obtained at each visit (D15, D30, D60, D90, D120, D150, and D180) were analyzed, showing trajectories over time and central tendencies each time. RESULTS: at baseline, the mean age was 41.1 (± 13.4) years; they were predominantly male, with income lower than a local minimum wage and at least six years of schooling. Patients showed predominantly pulmonary tuberculosis. At baseline, all patients suffered from malnutrition. The overall energy malnutrition prevalence was of 70.6%. Anemia at baseline was observed in both groups (63.2%), however, it was significantly more pronounced in the HIV+. At the end, energy malnutrition was reduced to 57.1% (42.9% of HIV- and 71.4% of the HIV+). Micronutrients malnutrition was evident in 71.4% of the HIV- patients and 85.7% of HIV+ patients at the end of tuberculosis therapy. Using BMI (≤ 18.5 kg/m2cutoff) as an index of malnutrition, it was detected in 23.9% of the HIV- and 27.3% of the HIV+ patients at baseline, with no evident improvement over time; using TSF (≤ 11.4mm as cutoff) or MUAC (≤ 28.5cm as cutoff), malnutrition was detected in 70.1% and 85.3% of all patients, respectively. Nevertheless, combining all biomarkers, at the end of follow-up, all patients suffered from malnutrition. CONCLUSION: Although with a limited number of patients, the evidence does not support that dietary counseling is effective to recover from malnutrition in our population.",

This study tested the efficacy of MI delivered by providers and registered dietitians (RDs) to parents of overweight children aged 2 through 8. METHODS: Forty-two practices from the Pediatric Research in Office Settings Network of the American Academy of Pediatrics were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 (usual care) measured BMI percentile at baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-up. Group 2 (provider only) delivered 4 MI counseling sessions to parents of the index child over 2 years. Group 3 (provider + RD) delivered 4 provider MI sessions plus 6 MI sessions from a RD. The primary outcome was child BMI percentile at 2-year follow up. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, the adjusted BMI percentile was 90.3, 88.1, and 87.1 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The group 3 mean was significantly (P = .02) lower than group 1. Mean changes from baseline in BMI percentile were 1.8, 3.8, and 4.9 across groups 1, 2, and 3. CONCLUSIONS: MI delivered by providers and RDs (group 3) resulted in statistically significant reductions in BMI percentile. Research is needed to determine the clinical significance and persistence of the BMI effects observed. How the intervention can be brought to scale (in particular, how to train physicians to use MI effectively and how best to train RDs and integrate them into primary care settings) also merits future research.",

Modified International Diabetes Foundation criteria with 80th/20th percentile cutoff points for the components were primarily applied in statistical analyses, and the results were replicated with the use of other pediatric MetS definitions. Between the ages of 15 and 20 years, the prevalence of MetS varied between 6.0% and 7.5% in participants in the intervention group and between 10% and 14% in the control group. The long-term relative risk of MetS was significantly lower in the intervention group (relative risk, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.88; P=0.009). Of the individual MetS components, the intervention decreased risk of high blood pressure in both sexes (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.99) and high triglycerides in male subjects (relative risk, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.98). A statistically nonsignificant reduction was seen in the risk of high waist circumference in the intervention individuals (relative risk, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.03). CONCLUSION: Repeated infancy-onset dietary intervention is effective in the prevention of MetS in adolescence. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

This randomized trial investigated the effect of combined individual dietary counseling with individualized swallowing therapy (intervention) compared to individual dietary counseling (control) on normalcy of food intake (NFI). METHODS: Patients with stage II to IV head and neck cancer treated with postoperative (chemo)radiation were randomly assigned to this study. NFI, dysphagia severity, social eating, and nutritional status were measured at the start of treatment and in weeks 6, 10, 18, and 30. RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients, 60 in each group, were recruited. No overall estimated difference was detected for NFI, dysphagia severity, social eating, or nutritional status. At week 10, the intervention group slightly improved dysphagia recovery 0.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-1.1). This difference diminished by week 30. CONCLUSION: Adding individualized swallowing therapy to individual dietary counseling did not improve NFI but slightly accelerate swallowing recovery. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

One-hundred subjects out of four-hundred patients met the inclusion criteria. Individually, 45-minute educational program with motivation counseling was performed in 0, 6 and 12 weeks of the study. Patients were advised to follow individually well-balanced diet for 12 weeks. The individuals were asked about the changes in their dietary habits (Food Frequency Questionnaire). The mean percentage of body weight changes from the baseline were as follows: in 6th week- 5.9%, in 12th week - 10.9% and in 52th week - 9.7% (P < 0.0001), however there were no statistically significant changes while comparing body weight in 12th and 52th week. The maintenance of body weight reduction was connected with the dietary habits changes, mainly the type of cooking and increased consumption of vegetable oils. In conclusion, individualized dietary counseling, based on narrative interview technique is an effective intervention for obesity treatment that may help maintain body weight reduction and adapt the pro-healthy changes in type of cooking and sources of dietary fat.",

Our nonrandomized multicenter prospective intervention study was undertaken to investigate the effects of dietary counseling on children with FA. Anthropometric data, dietary intakes, and laboratory biomarkers of nutritional status were evaluated in children with FA (aged 6 to 36 months) before and after dietary counseling, by multidisciplinary teams composed of pediatricians, dietitians, and nurses. Ninety-one children with FA (49 boys and 42 girls; mean age 18.9 months, 95% CI 16.5 to 21.3) were evaluated; 66 children without FA (41 boys and 25 girls; mean age 20.3 months, 95% CI 17.7 to 22.8) served as controls providing baseline values only. At enrollment, energy and protein intakes were lower in children with FA (91 kcal/kg/day, interquartile range [IQR]=15.1, minimum=55.2, maximum=130.6; and 2.2 g/kg/day, IQR=0.5, minimum=1.5, maximum=2.7, respectively) than in children without FA (96 kcal/kg/day, IQR=6.1, minimum=83.6, maximum=118.0; and 4.6 g/kg/day, IQR=1.2, minimum=2.0, maximum=6.1, respectively; P<0.001). A weight to length ratio <2 standard deviations was more frequent in children with FA than in children without FA (21% vs 3%; P<0.001). At 6 months following dietary counseling, the total energy intake of children with FA was similar to the baseline values of control children. Dietary counseling also resulted in a significant improvement of their anthropometric and laboratory biomarkers of nutritional status. The results of our study support the crucial role of dietary counseling in the clinical management of children with FA.",

OBJECTIVE: To objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of individual dietary counseling as part of a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment on nutritional status among community-dwelling people aged 75 years or older. METHODS: Data were obtained from a subpopulation of participants in the population-based Geriatric Multidisciplinary Strategy for the Good Care of the Elderly (GeMS) intervention study in 2004 to 2007. In the present study, the population consist 173 persons at risk of malnutrition in the year 2005 in an intervention (n=84) and control group (n=89). Nutritional status, body weight, body mass index, serum albumin were performed at the beginning of the study and at a two-year follow-up. The nutritional screening was performed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) test. RESULTS: A increase in MNA scores (1.8 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7 to 2.0) and in serum albumin (0.8 g/L, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.9 g/L) were a significant difference between the groups.

Counseling resulted in a higher intake of polyunsaturated FA and a lower intake of saturated FA. The dietary intake was reflected in cord blood TAGs: the n-6 to n-3 FA ratio was lower [mean difference -0.50 (95%CI -0.95 to -0.06)] and the sum of n-3 FA was higher in the intervention than in the control group [1.46 (0.44 to 2.48)% of total FA]. Reasons for the lack of changes in the cord blood CE fraction and FA fractions at 1-month remain unclear, but may indicate that the changes achieved in the maternal diet through counseling were too modest.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that bariatric surgery patients who undergo the purely restrictive procedures, such as the gastric banding (GB) or the vertical banded gastroplasty surgery, do not meet the dietary reference intakes for several nutrients. Whether dietary counseling improves micronutrient and macronutrient intakes was examined in GB surgery patients. METHODS: Twenty-three GB surgery patients received dietary and behavioral counseling for 12 weeks to limit energy intake and improve nutrient intakes. Food intake was assessed by 3-day food record at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks. Postintervention data were available in 21 patients. RESULTS: At baseline, more than 50% of the subjects reported inadequate dietary intakes of 13 nutrients but overconsumption of sodium and percent energy from saturated and trans-fatty acids. Mixed-effects model for repeated measures revealed a significant reduction in energy (P = 0.0007), absolute protein (P = 0.04), cholesterol (P = 0.045), and potassium (P = 0.01) intake and an increase in vitamin K (P = 0.03) intake and percent energy from protein (P = 0.005) during the 12 weeks. The McNemar test showed a reduction in the proportion of the subjects with an inadequate intake of vitamin K (P = 0.008) but an increase in the proportion of the subjects with an inadequate intake of thiamin (P = 0.03) at 12 weeks. The proportion of the subjects who did not meet the nutrient requirements for the remaining 27 nutrients was generally high and remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intervention improved the intake of some nutrients in the GB surgery patients. However, most nutrient intake requirements remained unmet by many subjects. These results indicate that nutritional counseling beyond 12 weeks is warranted in GB surgery patients to improve their dietary nutrient intakes.",

METHODS: Utilizing an observational study design, 189 obese adult patients with BED were treated by manualized therapy protocols. An independent assessment of health-related quality of life (Obesity-Related Well-Being questionnaire - ORWELL-97), attitudes toward eating (Eating Inventory - EI), binge eating (Binge Eating Scale - BES) and body uneasiness (Body Uneasiness Test - BUT) was performed at baseline, end-of-treatment, and six-month follow-up. These data are the secondary outcomes of a previously published treatment study. RESULTS: A higher dropout rate was observed in the DC compared to the EFT and CT groups, while body weight decreased significantly in all three groups. Pre-post scores on the BES, BUT Global Severity Index, and EI Hunger subscale significantly decreased in the CT and EFT groups (but not the DC group). At six-month follow-up, 71% of participants in CT and 46% of participants in EFT had a BES score below the threshold of attention for BED (≤16), whereas no participants in the DC group reached this target. Finally the ORWELL-97 score decreased significantly in all groups, but significantly more so in the CT and EFT groups. CONCLUSION: Results support the utility of combining EFT and DC in the treatment of patients with BED and obesity, emphasizing the usefulness of techniques focused on cognitive emotional processing for changing eating disorder psychopathology and quality of life.",

We here aimed in a prospective study initiated in early pregnancy to establish whether serum fatty acid (FA) compositions and concentrations in the mother can be modified by dietary means emphasizing counseling on a recommended diet. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Ninety women in the first trimester of pregnancy were randomized into intervention (n=45) or control (n=45) groups. The intervention comprised individual dietary counseling advocating choice of foods that will increase the intake of unsaturated and reduce that of saturated FA. To support this, appropriate products, including spreads, were provided for consumption at home. Dietary intakes were measured from food records and serum phospholipids, cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols FA were analyzed by gas chromatography. RESULTS: Dietary counseling resulted in lower intake of saturated and higher intake of unsaturated FA compared with the controls. These changes were reflected in higher proportions of serum phospholipid PUFA (mean difference between groups 0.61% (95% confidence interval, CI 0.05-1.17), P=0.03), docosahexaenoic acid (0.5% (0.15-0.85), P=0.01), sum of n-3 FA (0.61% (0.07-1.15), P=0.03) and lower ratio of n-6/n-3 FA (-0.42% (-0.81-0.03), P=0.03) in the intervention group at the third trimester of pregnancy but not at 1 month postpartum. Similar changes were seen in the FA of cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols. CONCLUSION: Maternal serum n-3 FA status during pregnancy can be improved by dietary means emphasizing the importance of dietary advice.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We reported previously that low-saturated-fat dietary counseling started in infancy improves insulin sensitivity in healthy children 9 years of age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lifelong dietary counseling on insulin sensitivity in healthy adolescents between 15 and 20 years of age. In addition, we examined dietary fiber intake and the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)+monounsaturated (MUFA)-to-saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio in the intervention and control adolescents and the association of these dietary factors with homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study comprised adolescents participating in the randomized, controlled Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project (STRIP) study, which aims to guide the study participants toward a diet beneficial for cardiovascular health. HOMA-IR was assessed annually between 15 and 20 years of age (n=518; intervention, n=245; control, n=273), along with diet, BMI, pubertal status, serum cotinine concentrations, and physical activity. Dietary counseling was given biannually during the follow-up. RESULTS: HOMA-IR was lower (7.5% on average) in the intervention group than in the control group between 15 and 20 years of age (P=0.0051). The intervention effect was similar in girls and boys. The PUFA+MUFA-to-SFA ratio was higher (P<0.0001) and the dietary fiber (g/MJ) intake was higher (P=0.0058) in the intervention group compared with the control group. There was no association between the PUFA+MUFA-to-/SFA ratio and HOMA-IR, whereas dietary fiber intake (g/MJ) was associated with HOMA-IR in girls (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary counseling initiated in infancy and maintained until 20 years of age was associated with improved insulin sensitivity in adolescents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diet is the first line of treatment for elevated cholesterol. High-intensity dietary counseling (≥360 minutes/year of contact with providers) improves blood lipids, but is expensive and unsustainable in the current healthcare settings. Low-intensity counseling trials (≤30 minutes/year) have demonstrated modest diet changes, but no improvement in lipids. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and the effects on lipids and diet of a low-intensity dietary counseling intervention provided by the primary care physician (PCP), in patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Six month study with a three month randomized-controlled phase (group A received the intervention, group B served as controls) followed by three months of intervention in both groups.Sixty-one adults age 21 to 75 years, with LDL-cholesterol≥3.37 mmol/L, possessing Internet access and active email accounts were enrolled. Diet was evaluated using the Rate-Your-Plate questionnaire. Dietary counseling was provided by the PCP during routine office visits, three months apart, using printed educational materials and a minimally interactive counseling website. Weekly emails were sent reminding participants to use the dietary counseling resources. The outcomes were changes in LDL-cholesterol, other lipid subclasses, and diet quality. RESULTS: At month 3, group A (counseling started at month 1) decreased their LDL-cholesterol by -0.23 mmol/L, (-0.04 to -0.42 mmol/L, P=0.007) and total cholesterol by -0.26 mmol/L, (-0.05 to -0.47 mmol/L, P=0.001). At month 6, total and LDL-cholesterol in group A remained better than in group B (counseling started at month 3). Diet score in group A improved by 50.3 points (38.4 to 62.2, P<0.001) at month 3; and increased further by 11.8 (3.5 to 20.0, P=0.007) at month 6. Group B made the largest improvement in diet at month 6, 55 points (40.0 to 70.1, P<0.001), after having a small but significant improvement at month 3, 22.3 points (12.9 to 31.7, P<0.001). No significant changes occurred in HDL-cholesterol in either group. CONCLUSIONS: A low-intensity dietary counseling provided by the PCP in patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases produced clinically meaningful improvements in both diet and lipids of magnitude similar to changes reported with high intensity interventions.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Western societies, cardiovascular (CV) disease is the primary cause of mortality, and high blood pressure (BP) is the main reversible factor leading to CV disease. Dietary habits and psychosocial stress contribute to the establishment of hypertension, while its role in the control of high BP is currently examined. In this study, we examined the effect and feasibility of a combined intervention of dietary education and stress management on the control of hypertension. METHODOLOGY: A randomized, controlled pilot study was designed to evaluate the effect of combined education on stress management techniques and dietary habits (Mediterranean diet principle) on office BP after eight weeks. RESULTS: Of the 45 randomized subjects, 36 were included in the final analysis (control group = 20 (age: 67 ± 12 years, 31.8%, males) and intervention group = 16 (age: 62 ± 12 years, 47%, males)). CV disease risk factors (except smoking), BP, dietary habits, perceived stress and physical activity (all assessed with validated questionnaires) were similar between the two groups at baseline. After eight weeks, office BP (systolic and diastolic) and perceived stress were significantly reduced, whereas the adherence in Mediterranean diet principle was significantly increased, but only in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: A combined intervention of stress management techniques and Mediterranean diet education seems to be beneficial for BP reduction. Such interventions could possibly serve as a complementary treatment along with drug therapy or in the early treatment of high normal BP. A call to action for designing epidemiological studies and evaluating the efficacy of such non-pharmacological treatment strategies is therefore warranted.",

This often leads to confusion rather than to real changes in eating behavior. The principle of a long-term weight reduction is based on the idea of achieving negative energy balance with a healthy, balanced and slightly hypocaloric diet. The regimen is neither supposed to be rigid nor should it ban any food products or food products. Changes in eating patterns come about step by step and the counseling approach should be based on the patient's habits and capabilities. The basic requirement to successfully treat obese patients is their own motivation Therefore, the timing of launching the therapy needs to be well chosen. Apart from goals directly concerning weight loss, goals related to well-being, general health and exercise should be set and pursued. However, the main focus should be on changes of dietary behavior. Dietary counseling is preferably embedded in a multidisciplinary treatment concept.",

Inadequate nutritional status is associated with poor prognosis. Dietary counseling and nutrition support can positively impact prognosis; however, the evidence is sparse and of poor quality. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence concerning the role of dietary counseling and nutrition support in head and neck cancer patients undergoing curative treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: There remains a lack of evidence both in quantity and quality. Current findings support a role for dietary counseling and nutrition support from diagnosis through rehabilitation. Prognostic indicators for nutrition support include tumor location, tumor stage, and multimodal treatment. Results of an innovative nutrition-based care delivery model were positive. SUMMARY: Dietary counseling is appropriate for all head and neck cancer patients to enable adequate oral intake from diagnosis through rehabilitation; however, some patients require nutrition support. Prognostic indicators and predictive models have been developed to identify patients who require early nutrition support. Next steps include development of evidence-based nutrition care paths that are tested at multiple sites using well designed longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials.",

METHODS: The randomized trial was conducted with 500 mothers who gave birth to full-term infants with birth weight ≥ 2500 g between October 2001 and June 2002 in São Leopoldo, Brazil. Mothers were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 200) and control groups (n = 300) and those in the intervention group received counseling on breastfeeding and complementary feeding by 12 fieldworkers on 10 home visits during the first year of children's lives. Blinded fieldworkers assessed dietary and anthropometric data at 12 to 16 months, 3 to 4 years, and 7 to 8 years and lipid profiles at 3 to 4 years and 7 to 8 years old. The lipid profile was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Of the 500 recruited children, 397 underwent the 12- to 16-month, 354 the 3- to 4-year, and 315 the 7- to 8-year assessment. The energy-dense foods intake was significantly lower in the intervention group at 12 to 16 months and 3 to 4 years old. At 3 to 4 years, serum lipid levels did not differ between groups. At 7 to 8 years, high-density lipoprotein levels were 0.11 mmol/L higher (0.00 to 0.20), and triglycerides concentration was 0.13 mmol/L lower (-0.25 to -0.01) in intervention children but only among the girls. Overweight/obesity rates did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary counseling for mothers during infancy decreased the energy-dense foods consumption and improved lipid profile.",

During the past several years, a greater appreciation for the need for multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes has developed, and a number of studies have been started to examine the role of postoperative interventions used in combination with surgery. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that the provision of postoperative dietary counseling, delivered by a registered dietitian, would lead to greater weight loss and more positive improvements in dietary intake and eating behavior compared with standard postoperative care. The study was performed at an academic medical center. METHODS: Eighty-four individuals who underwent bariatric surgery were randomly assigned to receive either dietary counseling or standard postoperative care for the first 4 months after surgery. The participants completed measures of macronutrient intake and eating behavior at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. RESULTS: The patients who received dietary counseling achieved greater weight loss than those who received standard postoperative care that did not involve this counseling, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Patients in the dietary counseling arm did report significant changes in several eating behaviors believed to be important to successful long-term weight maintenance. CONCLUSION: The results of our pilot study provide some support for the efficacy of early postoperative dietary counseling to improve outcomes after bariatric surgery.",

Our aim was to study the influences of repeated low saturated fat dietary counseling on dietary intakes and lipoprotein measures from infancy to adulthood. METHODS: Dietary intakes (food records) and serum lipid profile were studied annually from 7 months to 19 years of age in an atherosclerosis prevention study (Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project), comprising 540 children in the intervention group and 522 children in the control group. Serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) were measured and used to estimate very low-density lipoprotein-TG, intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HDL(2)-C, as well as apolipoproteins A-1 and B. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the intervention children had a lower saturated fat intake (mean daily difference [95% confidence interval] between groups: -2.1 [-2.3, -1.9] percentage of total energy intake in boys; -1.9 [-2.1, -1.7] percentage of total energy intake in girls, both P < .001) and LDL-C concentration (difference [95% confidence interval] between groups: -0.18 [-0.26, -0.10] mmol/L, P < .001 in boys; -0.10 [-0.19, -0.01] mmol/L, P = .037 in girls), whereas HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 did not differ between the study groups. In boys, total cholesterol and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein-TG, apolipoprotein B, and TG concentrations were also lower in the intervention than in the control group, whereas no differences were found in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated dietary counseling is effective in decreasing saturated fat intake and serum LDL-C values from infancy until 19 years of age in both genders. In boys, significant intervention effects are evident in various lipoprotein measures, indicating a more favorable lipid profile in the counseling group.",

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: São Leopoldo, Brazil. Mothers and infants of a low-income-group population were randomized into intervention (n = 163) and received dietary counseling during 10 home visits, or control (n = 234) groups. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Child consumption of sugar-dense (SD) and lipid-dense (LD) foods at 12 to 16 months. ANALYSIS: The effect of the intervention was expressed by relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the association between exclusive breastfeeding and the energy-dense foods intake. RESULTS: A smaller proportion of infants from the intervention group consumed candy, soft drinks, honey, cookies, chocolate, and salty snacks. In the intervention group, there was a reduction of 40% and 50% in the proportion of infants who consumed LD and SD foods, respectively. Being breastfed up to 6 months reduced the risk for consumption of LD and SD foods by 58% and 67%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Dietary counseling to mothers may be effective in reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods among infants, and it is helpful in improving early dietary habits.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact that a program based on maternal dietary counseling covering breastfeeding and healthy complementary feeding had on the prevalence of iron deficiency, anemia and iron deficiency anemia in children aged 12 to 16 months. METHODS: Newborn infants were randomized at birth to an intervention or a control group. Mothers in the intervention group received home visits during the children's first year of life on a monthly basis up to 6 months, and at 8, 10 and 12 months. The mothers in the control group received visits for data collection when children reached 6 and 12 months. All children were visited at ages between 12 and 16 months and 24-hour dietary recalls and hemoglobin and ferritin tests were conducted. RESULTS: There was no evidence that the intervention had an effect on anemia incidence, which was 66.5% in the intervention group and 61.8% in the control group. There was also no evidence of any difference between the groups in the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia or of iron deficiency. However, a higher percentage of children in the intervention group were exclusively breastfed at 4 and 6 months, and breastfed at 6 and 12 months. Intervention group children also consumed more meat and were fed diets with better iron bioavailability and consumed less cow's milk and calcium than children from the control group. CONCLUSION: This intervention had no effect on the prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Clinical trial registry identification number: NCT00629629.",

Fifty consecutive participants were randomly assigned to either a six-month individual treatment of CBT plus a low-energy-density diet (CBT+ED) or CBT plus General Nutrition counseling not related to weight loss (CBT+GN). Assessments occurred at six- and twelve-months. Eighty-six percent of participants completed treatment, and of these, 30% achieved at least a 5% weight loss with rates of binge remission ranging from 55% to 75%. The two treatments did not differ significantly in weight loss or binge remission outcomes. Significant improvements were found for key dietary and metabolic outcomes, with CBT+ED producing significantly better dietary outcomes on energy density, and fruit and vegetable consumption, than CBT+GN. Reductions in energy density and weight loss were significantly associated providing evidence for the specificity of the treatment effect. These favorable outcomes, and that CBT+ED was significantly better at reducing energy density and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption compared to CBT+GN, suggest that low-energy-density dietary counseling has promise as an effective method for enhancing CBT for obese individuals with BED.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The breast milk bioactive substances such as adiponectin, have a presumably long-term impact upon the health and well-being of a child. AIM: To determine the impact of probiotic-supplemented dietary counseling during pregnancy on colostrum adiponectin concentration. STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Altogether 256 pregnant women were randomized into three study groups: dietary intervention with probiotics (diet/probiotics) or with placebo (diet/placebo) and a control group (control/placebo). The intervention group received dietary counseling provided by a nutritionist, the main focus being the amount and the type of dietary fat. The probiotics used were Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis in combination. Dietary intake was evaluated by food records at every trimester of pregnancy. Breast milk samples were collected after birth (colostrum) for adiponectin concentration analysis (n=181). RESULTS: The dietary intervention increased the colostrum adiponectin concentration (ng/mL, geometric mean [95% CI]), the difference being significant when comparing to the control group; 12.7 [10.6-29.7] vs. 10.2 [9.9-13.2], P=0.024. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy (kg) correlated inversely with colostrum adiponectin concentration; β (SE)=-1.7 (0.1), P=0.020, and gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with the likelihood of adiponectin concentration falling into the lowest quartile; OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.1-3.2, P=0.028. CONCLUSIONS: In showing that the colostrum adiponectin concentration is markedly dependent on maternal diet and nutritional status during pregnancy, and considering that colostrum adiponectin has potential effects on metabolism, nutrition, and immune function in the neonates, the results of this study underscore the importance of the metabolic homeostasis of the mother for the child's initial nutritional environment.",

METHODS: the study was conducted at a known health unit located in the metropolitan region of the city of Porto Alegre, in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Three hundred and fifteen pregnant women between the 10th and 29th week of gestation were randomized to Control and Intervention Groups. The Intervention Group received dietary counseling according to nutritional status, and pregnant women in the Control Group were instructed to follow the routine of the health service facility. Weight and height were measured, and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The pre-gestational nutritional status was determined according to the following BMI criteria: low weight (<18.5 kg/m²), eutrophy (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m²), overweight (25.0 to 29.9 kg/m²), and obesity (>30 kg/m²). The nutritional status during pregnancy was determined according to the BMI curve for gestational age adopted by the Health Ministry of Brazil. Data were analyzed by the relative risk and respective 95% confidence interval, and by the Student's t-test and χ2 test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: the assessment of nutritional status before pregnancy showed that 28.0% of the women were overweight and 4.1% were underweight. In the first and last interview during pregnancy, the rates of prevalence of excessive weight were 36.2 and 46.0%, respectively. The intervention proved to be effective in reducing the rate of weekly weight gain of pregnant women with excess weight (342.2 versus 420.2; p=0.015) and the prevalence of clinical complications (9.2 versus 24.85; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: dietary counseling was effective in decreasing the weight gain of pregnant women who were overweight and reducing clinical complications, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, infant low weight, and prematurity in the Intervention Group.",

      "abstract": "To explore the effect of maternal dietary intervention on infant essential fatty acid (FA) status, we conducted a prospective, single-blind, randomized nutrition intervention study. At the first trimester of pregnancy, 90 women from families with a history of allergy were randomized either to receive intensive dietary counseling to modify dietary intake according to current recommendations or as controls. Infants' cord and 1-mo isolated serum phospholipid FA were identified and quantified by GC. Detectable levels of eicosatrienoic acid [ETA, 20:3(n-9)] were taken as a biochemical marker for essential FA deficiency, and the DHA sufficiency index [22:6(n-3):22:5(n-6)] and the DHA deficiency index [22:5(n-6):22:4(n-6)] were taken as markers for DHA [22:6(n-3)] status. The concentration of ETA was lower in cord blood in the intervention (I) group [median 0.64 (IQR 0.40-0.78) mg/L; 2.09 (1.31-2.54) μmol/L] than in the control (C) group [0.92 (0.54-1.20) mg/L; 3.00 (1.76-3.92) μmol/L] (P = 0.048). The proportion of ETA in total FA in the I group [0.73% (0.48-0.85%)] was lower than in the C group [0.93% (0.78-1.22%)] (P = 0.003). A higher DHA sufficiency index and lower DHA deficiency index were detected in cord blood in the I group than in the C group, although the groups did not differ in the DHA concentration or proportion of the total FA. There were no differences among groups at 1 mo for any of the variables measured. Our findings suggest a better supply of essential FA, particularly important during the period of rapid development, in infants whose mothers received dietary counseling. The results thus highlight the importance of maternal diet for child health, calling for dietary counseling for pregnant women in primary health care.",

METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study of the patients treated in our stone clinics from July 2007 to February 2009 was performed. All patients were evaluated with pre- and postintervention 24-hour urine collection and met a registered dietician. Recommendations to keep urine volume above 2 L per day, sodium restriction, protein moderation, increased calcium intake with meals and low oxalate diet combined with oral pyridoxine were given. Initial dosage ranged from 50 to 100 mg per day depending on the baseline oxalate level, and was titrated to a maximum of 200 mg daily. Subjects with at least two 24-hour urine collections were included in the study. RESULTS: Of 314 patients with complete metabolic and urinary profile evaluation, 95 subjects were identified with idiopathic hyperoxaluria. Mean follow-up was 18.4 ± 14.8 months and mean age was 50.3 ± 12.8 years. In patients treated with the combination of dietary counseling and pyridoxine, there was a significant change in urinary parameters in 75% of patients with a significant decrease in urinary oxalate excretion (58.26 ± 27.05 to 40.61 ± 15.04, P < .0001). In all, 39% of the patients had a decrease from a high urine oxalate levels (>40 mg/d) to a normal range urine oxalate (55.30 ± 22.04 to 33.45 ± 3.93, P = .0004). No peripheral neuropathy was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary management and medical treatment using pyridoxine may be an effective first-line therapy to decrease hyperoxaluria in patients who form stones.",

This study reports training, adoption, and implementation of an intervention to promote physical activity (PA) and dietary counseling in community health centers. METHODS: Providers (n = 30) and nurses (n = 28) from 9 clinics were invited to participate. Adopters completed CD-ROM training in stage-matched, patient-centered counseling and goal setting. Encounters were audio recorded. A subsample was coded for fidelity. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of providers and nurses adopted the program. Provider counseling was seen in 66% and nurse goal setting in 58% of participant (N = 266) encounters, although audio recordings were lower. Duration of provider counseling and nurse goal setting was 4.9 ± 4.5 and 7.3 ± 3.8 minutes, respectively. Most PA (80%) and diet (94%) goals were stage-appropriate. Although most providers discussed at least 1 behavioral topic, some topics (eg, self-efficacy, social support) were rarely covered. CONCLUSIONS: A sizeable percentage of providers and nurses completed training, rated it favorably, and delivered lifestyle counseling, although with variable fidelity.

A randomized field trial was conducted with 500 mother-child pairs from a low-income area of São Leopoldo, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to evaluate the impact of a nutritional intervention in the first year of life on the dietary quality of 3- to 4-y-old children. Mother-child pairs were randomized either to intervention and control groups and dietary counseling was provided for mothers in the intervention group during 10 home visits in the course of the first year of life. These visits were carried out by fieldworkers who counseled the mothers about the Ten Steps for Healthy Feeding from Birth to Two Years of Age, based on the WHO guidelines. Dietary intake was assessed at 3-4 y of age for 345 children using two 24-h food recalls. Overall diet quality was determined by the Healthy Eating Index. The prevalence of poor diet in the intervention group was lower compared with the control group [relative risk (RR) = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.13-0.71). The number of children who achieved the 75th percentile for the vegetable and fruit component score was higher in the intervention than in control group (RR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.31-2.89 and RR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.07-2.07, respectively).

METHODS: High-risk subjects (n=563) with hyperlipidemia from the Oslo Diet and Antismoking Study (1972-1977) were reexamined after 25 years and randomly assigned to a new 3-year prospective 2x2 factorial placebo-controlled study in 1997 of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and/or dietary counseling. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Life Satisfaction Index (LSI), and a new questionnaire on health concerns and behavior in response to risk information were collected at the 25-year follow-up. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and LSI were evaluated at the end of the 3-year Diet and Omega-3 Intervention Trial on atherosclerosis (DOIT) in 505 subjects. RESULTS: Twenty-five years after the screening program, HADS-anxiety was similar to the Norwegian norms (3.3 vs. 3.5), while HADS-depression was significantly lower (3.6 vs. 4.1, P<.01). Patients reported that 25 years of awareness of hyperlipidemia had influenced health concerns through a moderate change in diet habits, some restriction in life conduct, but an improvement of the total life situation. After a novel 3-year intervention in DOIT, there was no difference between the dietary counseling and control group with regard to anxiety, depression, or life satisfaction, but HADS-anxiety increased significantly (4.0 vs. 3.3, P<.001) in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared to the general population, screening-positive subjects did not have increased mental distress 25 years after screening, and beneficial health behavior persisted. Dietary counseling did not affect psychosocial outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary counseling is an integral part of treating malnutrition. A first step toward improving the management of moderate malnutrition is to evaluate dietary messages in current programs and assess their adequacy and effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain current recommendations regarding family foods for the treatment of moderate malnutrition and assess whether these are likely to meet nutritional requirements for rehabilitation; to review the effectiveness of dietary counseling in the management of moderate malnutrition. METHODS: Information was requested from 10 United Nations agencies or donors, 20 international nongovernmental organizations, 3 pediatric associations, and 6 national programs about the dietary advice they give to caregivers of moderately malnourished children. Adequacy was assessed by comparing dietary recommendations with nutritional requirements. Linear programming was used to identify problem nutrients. A literature search was conducted of studies using family foods for rehabilitating malnourished children. RESULTS: There was a greater emphasis on providing food supplements for rehabilitation than on utilizing family foods. Dietary recommendations were mostly vague and unlikely to be effective. Those developed by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization for well-nourished children may meet nutritional requirements in moderate malnutrition if the recommendations are made more prescriptive. Zinc and vitamin E emerged as possible problem nutrients. Intervention studies in wasted children suggest that counseling caregivers about family foods can achieve good rates of weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary counseling can be effective in managing malnutrition, but it is often weak or absent and should be strengthened. More attention will need to be given to formulating the messages and improving counseling skills.",

      "abstract": "Obese people may succeed in reducing their weight temporarily, but most of them regain the lost weight within a few years. We, therefore, recommend moderate long-term changes in habit rather than a strict temporary program. The purpose of this study was to examine whether physical activity of 40 minutes, mainly walking, was effective in improving or preventing metabolic syndrome when combined with dieting. Participants, all of whom had a waist circumference >or= 85 cm (men) or >or= 90 cm (women), were assigned into one of two groups: the control group (10 men and 11 women, age: 64.2 +/- 3.4 [SD] years) and the intervention group (10 men and 12 women, age: 62.4 +/- 4.2 years). Participants (n = 22) enrolled in a 52-week program; their diets were assessed using a 3-day dietary record and daily steps were measured with a pedometer. No significant change was seen in their dietary records, but the mean number of daily steps increased from 5,806 to 8,000-9,000. In the intervention group, BMI, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly by week 12 (all p < 0.001) and remained low until week 52. In fact, no significant change was seen between weeks 12 and 52. The control group showed no significant changes in all variables. These results indicate that gentle exercise of about 40 minutes in combination with dieting is effective in preventing metabolic syndrome among a sedentary population, although its effect may be limited.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Up to 50% of patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) are malnourished. There are limited data on the role of dietary intervention in improving the nutritional status of such patients. The aim was to compare the efficacy of medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-enriched commercial dietary supplements with dietary counseling for homemade food in the management of malnutrition in patients with CP. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive undernourished patients with CP (body mass index [BMI] <18.5 kg/m(2)) at a tertiary care hospital were randomized to receive either dietary counseling for regular homemade food or commercial MCT-enriched dietary supplements for a period of 3 months to compensate for the dietary calorie deficit. All patients received standard management for CP including pancreatic enzyme supplements. Primary outcome measure was improvement in BMI. RESULTS: Sixty malnourished patients with CP were randomized to counseling group (n = 29; mean age, 32 +/- 10 years; male, 83%) and supplementation group (n = 31; mean age, 28 +/- 10 years; male, 84%). BMI increased in both the counseling group and supplementation group (17.2 +/- 1.7 vs 18.1 +/- 1.8 kg/m(2), P = .001; 16.7 +/- 1.6 vs 18.2 +/- 1.6 kg/m(2), P = .001). There were similar improvements in triceps skinfold thickness, dietary intake, fecal fat, and pain score during a period of 3 months in both groups. There was, however, no significant difference between the counseling and supplementation groups with regard to any of the outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary counseling for a balanced homemade diet is as good as commercial food supplements in improving malnutrition in patients with CP.",

DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial with or without restriction of gestational weight gain to 6-7 kg by ten 1-h dietary consultations. SUBJECTS: Fifty nondiabetic nonsmoking Caucasian obese pregnant women were randomized into intervention group (n=23, 28+/-4 years, prepregnant body mass index (BMI) 35+/-4 kg m(-2)) or control group (n=27, 30+/-5 years, prepregnant BMI 35+/-3 kg m(-2)). MEASUREMENTS: The weight development was measured at inclusion (15 weeks), at 27 weeks, and 36 weeks of gestation. The dietary intakes were reported in the respective weeks by three 7-day weighed food records and blood samples for analyses of fasting s-insulin, s-leptin, b-glucose, and 2-h b-glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test were collected. RESULTS: The women in the intervention group successfully limited their energy intake, and restricted the gestational weight gain to 6.6 kg vs a gain of 13.3 kg in the control group (P=0.002, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-10.8 kg). Both s-insulin and s-leptin were reduced by 20% in the intervention group compared to the control group at week 27, mean difference: -16 pmol l(-1) (P=0.04, 95% CI: -32 to -1) for insulin and -23 ng ml(-1) (P=0.004, 95% CI: -39 to -8) for leptin. At 36 weeks of gestation, the s-insulin was further reduced by 23%, -25 pmol l(-1) (-47 to -4, P=0.022) and the fasting b-glucose were reduced by 8% compared with the control group (-0.3 mmol l(-1), -0.6 to -0.0, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Restriction of gestational weight gain in obese women is achievable and reduces the deterioration in the glucose metabolism.",

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effect of low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol dietary counseling on fat intakes, growth, serum cholesterol values, and pubertal development in children and adolescents. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the randomized prospective Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project (STRIP), a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet was introduced to intervention infants (n=540) at 7 months of age, and control children (n=522) received an unrestricted diet. Dietary intakes, serum cholesterol values, somatic growth, and development were followed up throughout childhood and adolescence. Saturated fat intakes, serum total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values were lower (P<0.001) in the intervention than in control children during the 14 years, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values in the 2 study groups showed no difference. Boys had lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations than girls throughout childhood (P<0.001), and the intervention effect on serum cholesterol concentration was larger in boys than girls. The 2 study groups showed no difference in growth, body mass index, pubertal development, or age at menarche (median, 13.0 and 12.8 years in the intervention and control girls, respectively; P=0.52). The cholesterol values decreased as puberty progressed. Mean concentrations of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased from approximately 4.5 and approximately 1.4 mmol/L, respectively, in Tanner stage 1 (prepubertal) boys to approximately 3.9 and approximately 1.1 mmol/L in Tanner stage 4 (late pubertal) boys. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated dietary counseling remains effective in decreasing saturated fat and cholesterol intake and serum cholesterol values at least until 14 years of age. Puberty markedly influences serum cholesterol concentrations.",

The effect of dietary counseling on long-term weight change is unclear. PURPOSE: To perform a meta-analysis of the effect of dietary counseling compared with usual care on body mass index (BMI) over time in adults. DATA SOURCES: Early studies (1980 through 1997) from a previously published systematic review; MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1997 through July 2006. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized, controlled trials (> or =16 weeks in duration) in overweight adults that reported the effect of dietary counseling on weight. The authors included only weight loss studies with a dietary component. DATA EXTRACTION: Single reviewers performed full data extraction; at least 1 additional reviewer reviewed the data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random-effects model meta-analyses of 46 trials of dietary counseling revealed a maximum net treatment effect of -1.9 (95% CI, -2.3 to -1.5) BMI units (approximately -6%) at 12 months. Meta-analysis of changes in weight over time (slopes) and meta-regression suggest a change of approximately -0.1 BMI unit per month from 3 to 12 months of active programs and a regain of approximately 0.02 to 0.03 BMI unit per month during subsequent maintenance phases. Different analyses suggested that calorie recommendations, frequency of support meetings, inclusion of exercise, and diabetes may be independent predictors of weight change. LIMITATIONS: The interventions, study samples, and weight changes were heterogeneous. Studies were generally of moderate to poor methodological quality. They had high rates of missing data and failed to explain these losses. The meta-analytic techniques could not fully account for these limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, dietary counseling interventions produce modest weight losses that diminish over time. In future studies, minimizing loss to follow-up and determining which factors result in more effective weight loss should be emphasized.",

Their claim is that PDC improves outcomes and postoperative compliance. We compared outcomes of GBP patients undergoing a mandatory 13 weeks of PDC (n = 72) to a contemporaneous group of patients with no such requirement (no-PDC; n = 252) who underwent operation between January 2000 and December 2002. METHODS: The PDC and no-PDC groups were characterized by similar male:female ratios (1:4 vs 1:4.6), mean age (42 years), mean body weight (324 lb vs 309 lb), and mean body mass index (BMI) (52 kg/m2 vs 50 kg/m2). The PDC group had a higher incidence of obstructive sleep apnea compared with the no-PDC group (41% vs 28%; P < .04) but otherwise the two groups had similar incidences of obesity-related comorbidities. The presurgery dropout rate was 50% higher in the PDC group than in the no-PDC group (28% vs 19%; P < .05). RESULTS: At 1 year follow-up, the no-PDC patients had a statistically greater percentage excess weight loss (67% vs 60%; P < .0001), lower BMI (32 vs 35; P < .015), and lower body weight (197 vs 218; P < .01). Resolution of major comorbidities, complication rates, 30-day postoperative mortality, and postoperative compliance with follow-up were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that insurance-mandated PDC is an obstacle to patient access for surgical treatment of severe obesity and has no impact on weight loss outcome or postsurgical compliance. PDC should be abandoned by the insurance industry.",

Testing included assessment of exercise capacity (VO(2peak)), quadricep muscle strength, body composition (DXA), nutritional intake (Block 95) and health-related quality of life (SF-36). The intervention consisted of individualized counseling and follow-up to home-based exercise and dietary modification. Repeated measure ANOVA was performed to determine differences over time between ExD and UC with a secondary analysis to determine differences over time between adherers (Adh), nonadherers (Nadh) to the intervention and UC. The ExD group showed greater increases in VO(2peak) (p = 0.036), and self-reported general health (p = 0.038) compared to UC. Both groups demonstrated increases in muscle strength, body weight, body fat and other SF-36 scale scores. Adherence to the intervention was 37% with positive trends in VO(2peak) and body composition observed in Adh compared to Nadh and UC. These data suggest improvements in exercise capacity and body composition are achieved with nutrition and exercise behavior modifications initiated early after OLT and with regular follow-up.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance is promoted already in childhood by obesity and possibly by high-saturated fat intake. We examined the effect of infancy onset biannually given dietary counseling on markers of insulin resistance in healthy 9-year-old children. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Healthy 7-month-old infants (n = 1,062) were randomized to the intervention (n = 540) and control (n = 522) groups. Each year, two individualized counseling sessions were organized to each intervention family. The purpose of counseling was to minimize children's exposure to known environmental atherosclerosis risk factors. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, serum lipids, blood pressure, and weight for height were determined in a random subgroup of 78 intervention children and 89 control children at the age of 9 years. RESULTS: Intervention children consumed less total and saturated fat than the control children (P = 0.002 and < 0.0001, respectively). The HOMA-IR index was lower in intervention children than in control children (P = 0.020). There was a significant association between saturated fat intake and HOMA-IR. In multivariate analyses including saturated fat intake, study group, and other determinants of HOMA-IR (serum triglyceride concentration, weight for height, and systolic blood pressure), study group was, whereas saturated fat intake was not, significantly associated with HOMA-IR. This suggests that the beneficial effect of intervention on insulin sensitivity was largely, but not fully, explained by the decrease in saturated fat intake. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term biannual dietary intervention decreases the intake of total and saturated fat and has a positive effect on insulin resistance index in 9-year-old children.",

Elevated concentrations of circulating cell adhesion molecules, thrombomodulin (TM), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen (tPAag) are related to atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: The randomized Diet and Omega-3 Intervention Trial (DOIT) targeted a comparison of the effect of 3-y dietary counseling, n-3 PUFA supplementation (2.4 g/d), or both on circulating markers of endothelial activation. DESIGN: The study included 563 elderly men with long-standing hyperlipidemia. The men were randomly assigned by factorial design into 4 groups: control (no dietary counseling and placebo capsules), dietary counseling (and placebo capsules), n-3 PUFA supplementation (no dietary counseling), and dietary counseling and n-3 PUFA supplementation. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of fatty acids reflected good compliance. Dietary counseling was followed by significantly reduced concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1; P < 0.001), sTM (P = 0.004), and tPAag (P < 0.001) than in subjects without dietary counseling. After n-3 PUFA supplementation, significantly reduced concentrations of sICAM-1 (P < 0.001) and sTM (P = 0.006) were observed when compared with subjects receiving placebo capsules. An increase in tPAag was not significantly different from that observed in subjects receiving placebo capsules. For sICAM-1, a significant effect was observed for both interventions combined. CONCLUSIONS: Each intervention (dietary counseling or n-3 PUFA supplements) reduced sTM and sICAM-1 concentrations, indicating decreased endothelial activation. The tPAag increase in the groups not receiving dietary counseling (pooled), which indicates progression of atherosclerosis, was significantly counteracted by dietary counseling.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of dietary counseling or nutritional supplements on outcomes in cancer patients: nutritional, morbidity, and quality of life (QoL) during and 3 months after radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 111 colorectal cancer outpatients referred for radiotherapy, stratified by staging, were randomly assigned: group 1 (G1; n = 37), dietary counseling (regular foods); group 2 (G2; n = 37), protein supplements; and group 3 (G3; n = 37), ad libitum intake. Nutritional intake (diet history), status (Ottery's Subjective Global Assessment), and QoL (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0) were evaluated at baseline, at the end, and 3 months after radiotherapy. RESULTS: At radiotherapy completion, energy intake increased in G1/G2 (P < or = .04), G1 more than G2 (P = .001), and decreased in G3 (P < .01). Protein intake increased in G1/G2 (P < or = .007), G1 less than G2 (not significant), and decreased in G3 (P < .01). At 3 months, G1 maintained nutritional intake and G2/G3 returned to baseline. After radiotherapy and at 3 months, rates of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were higher in G3 (P < .05). At radiotherapy completion, in G1 all QoL function scores improved proportionally to adequate intake or nutritional status (P < .05); whereas in G2 only three of six function scores improved proportionally to protein intake (P = .04), and in G3 all scores worsened (P < .05). At 3 months, G1 patients maintained/improved function, symptoms, and single-item scores (P < .02); in G2, only few function and symptom scales improved (P < .05); in G3, QoL remained as poor as after radiotherapy. In G1/G2, respectively, improvement/deterioration of QoL correlated with better or poorer intake or nutritional status (P < .003). CONCLUSION: During radiotherapy, both interventions positively influenced outcomes; dietary counseling was of similar or higher benefit, whereas even 3 months after RT, it was the only method to sustain a significant impact on patient outcomes.",

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: At the age of 7 months, 1062 infants were randomized to an intervention group (n = 540) or a control group (n = 522). At the age of 8 years, body satisfaction of 217 children in the intervention group and 218 in the control group was evaluated.Intervention Since the children were 8 months old, families in the intervention group had regularly received individualized health education and dietary advice aimed at decreasing the children's intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A pictorial instrument was used in measuring estimated current and desired body sizes; a difference between the 2 indicated body dissatisfaction. Weight and height were measured. RESULTS: When adjusted for relative weight, there were no differences in the mean values of estimated current size, desired size, or body dissatisfaction between the girls in the intervention and control groups (P =.62, P =.72, and P =.39, respectively), or between the boys in the intervention and control groups (P =.21, P =.64, and P =.53, respectively). The proportions of children who were satisfied with their size, who wished to be thinner, or who wished to look heavier did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either girls (P =.65) or boys (P =.85). CONCLUSION: Long-term, individualized dietary counseling since infancy with the focus on dietary fat did not enhance body dissatisfaction or desire to be thinner in 8-year-old children.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association between vascular disease and elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations is caused, in part, by inadequate intakes of dietary folate. Increasing folate intake either through supplements or foods naturally rich in folates has been shown to decrease tHcy concentrations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether a similar reduction in tHcy was possible in free-living persons receiving dietary counseling. DESIGN: The study included a 4-wk placebo-controlled dietary intervention trial in which participants consumed either unfortified breakfast cereal (control group) or an extra 350 micro g folate derived from food/d (dietary group). Serum folate and tHcy concentrations in both groups were measured before and after the intervention period, and the concentrations in the dietary group were also measured 17 wk after the intervention period. RESULTS: During the 4-wk intervention, mean dietary folate intake in the dietary group increased from 263 (95% CI: 225, 307) to 618 micro g/d (535, 714), resulting in a mean increase in serum folate of 37% (15%, 63%) and a decrease in tHcy from 12.0 (10.9, 13.3) to 11.3 micro mol/L (10.2, 12.5). A further decrease in tHcy occurred in the dietary group during follow-up, with a final tHcy concentration of 9.7 micro mol/L (8.8, 10.8). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing natural folate intake improved folate status and decreased tHcy concentrations to an extent that may significantly reduce the risk of vascular disease. Dietary modification may have advantages over folic acid fortification because the altered food-consumption patterns lead to increased intakes of several vitamins and minerals and decreased intakes of saturated fatty acids.",

To determine whether nurse counseling can provide additional benefits over usual physician efforts to lower dietary fat in high-risk persons, 117 apparently healthy adult siblings of persons with premature coronary heart disease were counseled by a registered nurse using adapted national guidelines. Reductions in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol were significantly greater in the nurse group compared to those in the usual care group. Total fat intake decreased by 14 g in the nurse group, compared with an increase of 5 g in the usual care group (p=0.0001). Assignment to the nurse group was also a significant predictor of a greater reduction in the percentage of total fat calories (p=0.008). The authors conclude that a registered nurse may serve as a complement to usual care in efforts to lower dietary fat and cholesterol in high-risk families. (c)2001 CHF, Inc."

Changes resulting from dietary effect alone versus diet and drug effect have not yet been fully established. Seventy subjects were enrolled into four treatment groups to determine the impact of diet and drug effect upon TC and TG. Group 1 (n = 28) served as the control group and received no dietary counseling or drug therapy. Group 2 (n = 22) received dietary counseling. Group 3 (n = 7) underwent dietary counseling for six months and drug therapy for eighteen months. Subjects in groups 1-3 were monitored for eighteen months. Patients in group 4 (n = 13) were followed up for thirty-six months. No intervention occurred during the first eighteen months, and hypolipidemic medications were used during the second eighteen-month period. Subjects in groups 1 and 4 received no specific dietary counseling and demonstrated no significant improvement over the course of the study. Patients in groups 2 and 3 showed significant reductions in both TC and TG. The improvement in TC seen for patients in group 3 was reduced after dietary counseling ceased. Dietary intervention is necessary if patients are to statistically significantly reduce TC and TG levels. Drug therapy demonstrated the expected reductions in both TC and TG but did not statistically significantly lower lipid levels without concomitant dietary counseling. When dietary counseling and hypolipidemic medications are used together, reductions in TC and TG values are even greater than those seen with dietary effect alone. Diet control alone appears to significantly reduce TC and TG levels, resulting in reduced need for antianginal medications.",

We instituted a factorial design, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test two interventions. We tested the trial at continuity care clinics of internal medicine residents at seven community and university medical centers in the northern and eastern United States. Our participants were 130 internal medicine residents and 254 adult outpatients with blood cholesterol levels of 240-300 mg/dL. Interventions included an educational program for resident physicians designed to improve their skills and confidence in dietary counseling (two one-hour sessions with specially prepared printed materials for use in counseling) and a prompting intervention, which was a fingerstick blood cholesterol determination prior to the patient's clinic visit. Resident physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors were assessed prior to the intervention and 10 months later using chart audits and questionnaires. Residents' behaviors were also assessed by exit interviews with patients. Patients' knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and fingerstick blood cholesterol levels were measured at baseline and 10 months later. The educational program increased the percentage of physicians who were confident in providing effective dietary counseling (baseline of 26% to 67%-78%; P < .01). The prompting intervention approximately doubled the frequency of physician counseling (P = .0005) and increased the likelihood that patients would try to change their diets. When both interventions were combined, most outcomes were better, although not statistically significant. Cholesterol levels, however, decreased only marginally and were no different among groups at 10-month follow-up. Despite success in changing physicians' attitudes and behaviors and increasing patients' willingness to change their diets, there was no significant change in patients' cholesterol levels.

DESIGN: A 2-month, nonrandomized comparative study of dietary counseling efficacy in subjects with hyperlipidemia. Dietary instruction was conducted in a lipid clinic by dietitians. Subjects were instructed to follow a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol (National Education Cholesterol Program step 1 or 2 diets) for 2 months with concomitant energy restriction for weight reduction when necessary. Another group of patients who did not receive dietary counseling during the same period served as a control. SUBJECTS: Ambulatory patients were recruited from the Lipid Clinic of the Montreal Clinical Research Institute. INTERVENTION: Dietary counseling was provided to 104 subjects with hypercholesterolemia and 113 subjects with hypertriglyceridemia. They were compared with 72 subjects with hypercholesterolemia and 80 subjects with hypertriglyceridemia who did not receive dietary counseling. RESULTS: In the hypercholesterolemic group, significant reductions in plasma cholesterol (mean +/- standard deviation = -5.7 +/- 11.7%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-7.3 +/- 14.2%) and no changes in plasma very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were observed after dietary counseling. The LDL-C response to diet was normally distributed, and 20% of the individuals with hypercholesterolemia reached LDL-C levels below 4.1 mmol/L. In patients with hypercholesterolemia and no clinical evidence of familial hypercholesterolemia, (n = 76) the reductions in plasma cholesterol (-6.6 +/- 10.8%) and LDL-C (-8.2 +/- 14%) were more pronounced. Among the latter patients, 27.6% reached LDL-C levels below 4.1 mmol/L. In subjects with hypertriglyceridemia, the reductions in plasma cholesterol (-4.8 +/- 12.8%), triglycerides (-20.7 +/- 33%), and VLDL-C (-19.5 +/- 29%) were associated with an increase in LDL-C (+8.5 +/- 25.7%) and HDL-C (+5.5 +/- 18%). Of the subjects with hypertriglyceridemia, 20% had triglyceride levels below 2.3 mmol/L after treatment. No significant changes were observed in the control groups during the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary counseling of subjects with hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia was associated with beneficial changes in plasma lipid levels after 2 months of dietary intervention. However, longer and more controlled dietary interventions are necessary for most patients to achieve lipid goals.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study examined the effect of frequent nutritional counseling on oral intake, body weight, response rate, survival, and quality of life in patients with cancer of the lung (small-cell), ovary, or breast undergoing cyclic chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 105 assessable patients, 57 were randomized to receive nutritional counseling, and 48 to receive no nutritional counseling and consumption of an ad lib oral intake. The intervention group was counseled to achieve a daily energy and protein intake according to recommended dietary allowances. Counseling was standardized and performed by a trained dietitian, and took place twice monthly during a 5-month period from start of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Dietary counseling increased daily energy intake by approximately 1 MJ and protein intake by 10 g over the entire study period. There was no change in the control group. Counseling led to an insignificant increase in body weight, but triceps skinfold measurement increased significantly after 5 months. Response rate and overall survival did not differ between the groups. Quality of life measured by the Quality-of-Life index (QL-index) increased significantly in both groups, but did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: No clinical benefit could be demonstrated despite long-term and continuous improved food intake in cancer patients with solid tumors undergoing aggressive chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "After obesity surgery, the primary measurement of success is the amount of weight lost. There has, however, been little assessment of how patients cope with the dietary constraints imposed by gastroplasty. Similarly, dietary patterns adopted to cope with these constraints have not been studied fully. These factors are of great importance in terms of nutritional adequacy, patient acceptability and long-term success. A study involving 32 patients was conducted to ascertain whether practical nutritional intervention and extensive follow-up would improve the overall outcome of the gastroplasty operation with respect to the type of foods tolerated and the incidence of regurgitation or vomiting experienced. To quantify success in terms of frequency of regurgitation and variety of food intake a vomiting/eating (V/E) score was devised. The results showed that the group of patients with more intensive practical education and counseling had a more varied intake of food and coped better with a wider variety of solid foods in the long term. Despite a more solid diet they did not regurgitate food as frequently as patients with less education, and over half the study group of patients reported no regurgitation at all. From this study, it is proposed that patients can be assessed and categorized postoperatively using a V/E scale. This scale numerically scores success with diet after gastroplasty, which, when recorded in conjunction with subsequent weight loss, can give a better quantification of success after obesity surgery."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of internal medicine residents concerning dietary counseling for hypercholesterolemic patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey. SETTING: Survey conducted August 1989 in seven internal medicine residency programs in four southeastern and middle Atlantic states. PARTICIPANTS: All 130 internal medicine residents who were actively participating in outpatient continuity clinic. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only 32% of the residents felt prepared to provide effective dietary counseling, and only 25% felt successful in helping patients change their diets. Residents had good scientific knowledge, but the degree of practical knowledge about dietary facts varied. Residents reported giving dietary counseling to 58% of their hypercholesterolemic patients and educational materials to only 35%. Residents who felt more self-confident and prepared to counsel reported more frequent use of effective behavior modification techniques in counseling. Forty-three percent of residents had received no training in dietary counseling skills during medical school or residency. CONCLUSION: Internal medicine residents know much more about the rationale for treatment for hypercholesterolemia than about the practical aspects of dietary therapy, and they feel ineffective and ill-prepared to provide dietary counseling to patients.",

Subjects received medication (naltrexone, 300 mg/day or placebo) for 8 weeks following an initial 2-week single-blind placebo phase. The results failed to demonstrate an advantage for the active drug. However, the naltrexone was associated with hepatotoxicity when used at this dosage in this population.",

An experimental process applying the principles of diet therapy and counseling in a situation involving volunteer clients was initiated, and the effects were measured. A pretest-post-test design was used for this investigation. Two psychometric instruments, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the Affective Sensitivity Scale, were used to measure changes in attitudes, values, and aptitude. The curriculum of the treatment group (19 juniors in the CUP) was reorganized so that diet therapy and dietary counseling would be taught during the same semester. The laboratory sessions were combined the last 6 weeks of the semester to provide an opportunity for students to counsel clients recruited from the university campus. The comparison group (11 seniors in the CUP) had enrolled in diet therapy the first semester of the junior year and dietetic counseling the second semester; those students were tested during their senior year. The research indicated that the students in the treatment group learned effectively. They significantly increased their awareness, listening, and understanding during the treatment period. The post-test of the treatment group indicated that they had increased perception and more acute affective sensitivity in comparison with the control group.",
