      "abstract": "Rheumatic diseases (RDs) present a major global health challenge, particularly in aging populations, due to chronic inflammation, progressive joint damage, and impaired mobility. While pharmacologic interventions, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), remain central to RDs management, concerns regarding their side effects and incomplete symptom relief have increased interest in complementary therapies. Sauna therapy, particularly its Finnish and infrared modalities, has emerged as a promising non-pharmacologic intervention with potential anti-inflammatory, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular benefits. Heat exposure modulates inflammatory pathways by reducing pro-inflammatory agents (TNF-α, CRP, PGE2, LTB4) while promoting IL-10-mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, sauna therapy mitigates oxidative stress and enhances neuroendocrine regulation, contributing to systemic health benefits. Clinical evidence points to benefits of sauna therapy related to alleviating pain, reducing stiffness, and improving mobility in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and osteoarthritis (OA). Some studies have demonstrated reductions in pain scores and inflammatory markers, improved physical function, and disease stability following infrared sauna exposure. Moreover, cardiovascular advantages of regular sauna use are particularly relevant for RD patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. Given the growing body of evidence supporting its therapeutic potential, sauna therapy represents a viable adjunctive strategy for RD management. Further research is warranted to optimize treatment protocols, assess long-term safety, and delineate patient-specific benefits. Integrating sauna therapy into comprehensive RD care may enhance symptom control, improve quality of life, and reduce reliance on pharmacologic interventions.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Heat therapy (HT), particularly in the form of whole-body sauna bathing, has emerged as a promising intervention for the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Passive HT can induce both local and systemic physiological responses, primarily through repeated thermal stress consisting of short-term passive exposure to high temperatures. Such responses closely parallel the physiological adaptations observed during aerobic exercise. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) poses significant health challenges, impacting millions of individuals worldwide. Supervised exercise is considered a cornerstone therapy for PAD, yet many patients face significant health-related barriers that complicate its broad implementation. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature to explore the therapeutic implications of various HT practices beyond sauna. The review aimed to evaluate the potential use of these practices as adjunctive management strategies for cardiovascular diseases, particularly in patients with PAD. RESULTS: Recent studies have demonstrated the potential role of HT in alleviating PAD symptoms, improving functional capacity, and reducing cardiovascular and limb events. HT practices might be beneficial as adjunctive management strategies, in addition to or as alternatives to exercise, for management of cardiovascular diseases. DISCUSSION: This review highlights the potential benefits, underlying mechanisms of action, challenges, and safety considerations associated with HT. We emphasize the importance of exploring HT as a viable option for patients with cardiovascular conditions, particularly those with PAD, who face barriers to traditional exercise regimens."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether regular use of infrared sauna (IRS) after training can promote neuromuscular performance and positive changes in body composition during a 6-week training period. METHODS: Forty female team sport athletes were pair-matched into two groups: IRS (n = 20) and control (CON; n = 20). Physical performance tests, body composition and hypertrophy measurements (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and ultrasound of m. vastus lateralis) were performed PRE and POST a 6-week strength and power training period, involving 2-3 sessions per week. Performance tests included a 20 m sprint, squat jump (SJ), countermovement jumps with body weight (CMJ) as well as with 15, 25, and 50% additional load (CMJ15%, CMJ25%, and CMJ50%), and a maximal isometric leg press (MVC). Participants in the IRS-group used IRS (10 min, 50℃) after training three times per week. RESULTS: Training improved neuromuscular performance and muscle hypertrophy in both groups (p < 0.05). Following the discovery of an interaction effect for CMJ15% height (p = 0.002) and peak power (p = 0.010), post hoc tests revealed higher jump height POST-IRS (p = 0.006) and PRE-CON (p = 0.023) compared to PRE-IRS, and higher peak power POST-IRS (p = 0.002) compared to PRE-IRS. Furthermore, an interaction effect was observed for 5 m split time of the 20 m sprint (p = 0.020), but no differences were found between groups and timepoints. There were no interactions for the hypertrophy measures. CONCLUSION: Incorporating post-exercise IRS bathing does not significantly impact hypertrophy gains, but might boost long-term power production capabilities."

      "abstract": "A man in his mid-70s passed out in a public 90-degree sauna and remained unconscious for at least half an hour. He suffered third-degree burns to approximately 50% of his body surface area. Despite immediate transport to a burn center and intensive care therapy, he did not regain consciousness and died eleven days later.When the body was opened, the lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen showed changes consistent with the burns, intensive care therapy, and clinically suspected septic shock. The stomach contained approximately 200 ml of thickened chyme with coarse vegetable components. Such food components were not seen in the duodenum or in the following intestinal segments.Considering the overall circumstances, the stomach contents must have been the last meal the man had eaten before the sauna session. The problem of reduced gastrointestinal motility in burn patients is clinically recognized. Nevertheless, a complete failure of gastric emptying for eleven days after intensive care therapy has not been described before and shows that the use of gastric contents in forensic practice is inappropriate for drawing conclusions about the time interval between last food intake and death and thus for estimating the time of death."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Passive heat treatment has been suggested to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Previous studies have focused predominantly on hot water immersion and traditional sauna bathing, as opposed to the more novel method of infrared-based sauna bathing. Here, the impact of a single infrared sauna session on post-prandial glycemic control was assessed in older individuals with T2DM. METHODS: In this randomized controlled crossover trial, 12 participants with T2DM (male/female: 10/2, age: 69±7 y, BMI: 27.5±2.9 kg/m2) rested in an infrared sauna twice: once in a heated (60°C) and once in a thermoneutral (21°C) condition for 40 min, immediately followed by a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Venous blood samples were obtained to assess plasma glucose and insulin concentrations and to determine the whole-body composite insulin sensitivity index. RESULTS: Body core and leg skin temperature were higher following the heated condition compared to the thermoneutral condition (38.0±0.3 vs. 36.6±0.2°C and 39.4±0.8 vs. 31.3±0.8°C, respectively; P<0.001 for both). The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of plasma glucose concentrations during the OGTT was higher after the heated condition compared to the thermoneutral condition (17.7±3.1 vs. 14.8±2.8 mmol/L/120 min; P<0.001). No differences were observed in plasma insulin concentrations (heated: 380±194 vs. thermoneutral: 376±210 pmol/L/120 min; P=0.93) or whole-body composite insulin sensitivity indexes (4.5±2.8 vs. 4.5±2.1; P=0.67). CONCLUSIONS: A single infrared sauna session does not improve postprandial blood glucose handling in individuals with T2DM. Future studies should assess the effect of more prolonged application of infrared sauna bathing on daily glycemic control.",

      "abstract": "Passive heat therapy is characterized by exposure to a high environmental temperature for a brief period. There are several types of passive heat therapy which include hot tubs, Waon therapy, hydrotherapy, sanarium, steam baths, infrared saunas and Finnish saunas. The most commonly used and widely studied till date are the Finnish saunas, which are characterized by high temperatures (ranging from 80-100°C) and dry air with relative humidity varying from 10-20%. The goal of this review is to provide a summary of the current evidence on the impact of passive heat therapies particularly Finnish saunas on various health outcomes, while acknowledging the potential of these therapies to contribute to the extension of healthspan, based on their demonstrated health benefits and disease prevention capabilities. The Finnish saunas have the most consistent and robust evidence regarding health benefits and they have been shown to decrease the risk of health outcomes such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, dementia, and respiratory conditions; may improve the severity of musculoskeletal disorders, COVID-19, headache and flu, while also improving mental well-being, sleep, and longevity. Finnish saunas may also augment the beneficial effects of other protective lifestyle factors such as physical activity. The beneficial effects of passive heat therapies may be linked to their anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective and anti-oxidant properties and synergistic effects on neuroendocrine, circulatory, cardiovascular and immune function. Passive heat therapies, notably Finnish saunas, are emerging as potentially powerful and holistic strategies to promoting health and extending the healthspan in all populations."

      "abstract": "Sauna has been linked to a reduction of cardiovascular disease risk and is a promising nonpharmacological treatment for populations at risk of cardiovascular disease. This study examined the vascular response to an acute bout of sauna heating in young and middle-aged individuals. Ten young (25 ± 4 yr, 6 males and 4 females) and eight middle-aged adults (56 ± 4 yr, 4 males and 4 females) underwent 40 min of sauna exposure at 80°C. Esophageal and intramuscular temperatures, brachial and superficial femoral artery blood flow, artery diameter, and shear rates were recorded at baseline and following heat exposure. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured at baseline and following 90 min of recovery. Esophageal and muscle temperatures increased similarly in the young and middle-aged adults by 1.5 ± 0.53 and 1.95 ± 0.70°C, respectively (P < 0.05). The shear rate increased by 170-200% (P < 0.001), while blood flow increased by 180-390% (P < 0.001) in the superficial femoral and brachial arteries, respectively, and did not differ between age groups (P = 0.190-0.899). Systolic blood pressure was reduced from 135 ± 17 to 122 ± 20 mmHg (P = 0.017) in middle-aged participants. These data indicate that young and middle-aged adults have similar vascular responses to acute sauna heating.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sauna therapy has been shown to improve cardiovascular health and function in older adults and individuals with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

A low-cost, portable steam sauna pod may offer an additional tool for those seeking to manipulate physiological (cardiovascular, thermoregulatory and sudomotor) and perceptual responses for improving sporting or health profiles. This study aimed to 1) report the different levels of heat stress and determine the pods' inter-unit reliability, and 2) quantify the reliability of physiological and perceptual responses to passive heating. METHOD: In part 1, five pods were assessed for temperature and relative humidity (RH) every 5 min across 70 min of heating for each of the 9 settings. In part 2, twelve males (age: 24 ± 4 years) completed two 60 min trials of passive heating (3 × 20 min at 44 °C/99% RH, separated by 1 week). Heart rate (HR), rectal (Trectal) and tympanic temperature (Ttympanic) were recorded every 5 min, thermal comfort (Tcomfort) and sensation (Tsensation) every 10 min, mean arterial pressure (MAP) at each break period and sweat rate (SR) after exiting the pod. RESULTS: In part 1, setting 9 provided the highest temperature (44.3 ± 0.2 °C) and longest time RH remained stable at 99% (51±7 min). Inter-unit reliability data demonstrated agreement between pods for settings 5-9 (intra-class correlation [ICC] >0.9), but not for settings 1-4 (ICC <0.9). In part 2, between-visits, high correlations, and low typical error of measurement (TEM) and coefficient of variation (CV) were found for Trectal, HR, MAP, SR, and Tcomfort, but not for Ttympanic or Tsensation. A peak Trectal of 38.09 ± 0.30 °C, HR of 124 ± 15 b min-1 and a sweat loss of 0.73 ± 0.33 L were reported. No between-visit differences (p > 0.05) were observed for Trectal, Ttympanic, Tsensation or Tcomfort, however HR (+3 b.min-1) and MAP (+4 mmHg) were greater in visit 1 vs. 2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Portable steam sauna pods generate reliable heat stress between-units. The highest setting (44 °C/99% RH) also provides reliable but modest adjustments in physiological and perceptual responses.",

This study determined if an 8-wk Finnish sauna intervention improves peripheral endothelial function, microvascular function, central arterial stiffness, and blood pressure in adults with coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-one adults (62 ± 6 yr, 33 men/8 women) with stable CAD were randomized to 8 wk of Finnish sauna use (n = 21, 4 sessions/wk, 20-30 min/session, 79°C, 13% relative humidity) or a control intervention (n = 20, lifestyle maintenance). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), total (area under the curve) and peak postocclusion forearm reactive hyperemia, and blood pressure (automated auscultation) were measured before and after the intervention. After the sauna intervention, resting core temperature was lower (-0.27°C [-0.54, -0.01], P = 0.046) and sweat rate during sauna exposure was greater (0.3 L/h [0.1, 0.5], P = 0.003).

The change in total (P = 0.031) and peak (P = 0.024) reactive hyperemia differed between interventions due to a nonsignificant decrease in response to the sauna intervention and an increase in response to control. The change in cf-PWV (P = 0.816), systolic (P = 0.951), and diastolic (P = 0.292) blood pressure did not differ between interventions.

The aim of this study was to identify the causes for injuries, the affected body regions and to define recommendations for prevention. METHODS: A retrospective chart data analysis was conducted among patients treated for an injury related to sauna bathing at the local trauma centre of the Medical University of Innsbruck between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2021. Patients' demographics, the cause for the injury, the diagnosis, the body region of the trauma and the treatment methods were collected. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine patients with injuries related to sauna bathing (83 female [39.7%] and 126 male [60.3%]) were identified. Fifty-one patients showed more than one injuries leading to a total of 274 diagnosis: contusions/distorsions (113; 41.2%), wounds (79; 28.8%), fractures (42; 15.3%), ligament injuries (17; 6.2%), concussions (15; 5.5%), burns (4; 1.5%) and brain bleeding (3; 1.1%). The most common cause for an injury was a slip/fall (157; 57.5%) followed by dizziness/syncope (82; 30.0%). Interestingly, head and face injuries were mostly caused by dizziness/syncope, whereas slip/fall was the leading cause for injuries of foot, hand, forearm and wrist. Nine patients(4.3%) needed surgical treatment mainly due to fractures. Eight patients got injured by wood splinters. One patient sustained grade IIB-III burns lying unconscious with an alcohol intoxication of 3.6‰ in the sauna. CONCLUSION: The main causes for injuries during sauna bathing were slip/falls and dizziness/syncopes. The latter one might be prevented by improved of the personal behaviour (e.g. drink enough water before and after each sauna bathing), whereas slip/falls might be prevented by the revision of safety regulations, particularly the obligation to wear slip resistant slippers. Thus, everyone himself as well as the operators can contribute to reduce injuries related sauna bathing.",

      "abstract": "There are limited treatment options for women with severely diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) who experience repeatedly failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles and with persistently thin endometrial lining thickness (EMT) during frozen embryo transfer cycles. Therefore, a large majority of patients resort to using donor oocytes and gestational carriers. Data from existing animal and human studies suggest that ozone sauna therapy (OST) and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF) are emerging as potential therapeutic adjuncts for female reproduction. This study was conducted to assess the fertility outcome of OST + PEMF in vivo in patients undergoing IVF/frozen embryo transfe and the effects of OST in vitro on human granulosa cell (GC) function. Forty-four women with DOR underwent their 1st IVF cycle (Cycle 1), and then were administered transdermal and intravaginal OST + PEMF, twice a week for 3 weeks, followed by a 2nd IVF cycle (Cycle 2) using the same protocol as in Cycle 1. GCs collected from another six women who underwent egg retrieval were equally split and cultured with OST (test) or placed in room temperature (control) outside the OST chamber in the same room. The results demonstrated that Cycles 1 and 2 had no significant difference in the number of days of stimulation, baseline hormones measured, number of oocytes retrieved or peak estradiol levels. However, the number of embryos formed after OST + PEMF in Cycle 2 was significantly higher than the Cycle 1. Furthermore, EMT measured in Cycle 2 demonstrated a significant increase compared to Cycle 1 and all patients reached a satisfactory EMT of approximately 7 mm. In vitro studies demonstrated that OST led to a 5-fold significant increase in the aromatase enzyme while a significant 50% reduction was noted in the side-chain cleavage enzyme in GCs. Both OST + PEMF are known for their vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant actions, which could enhance endometrial receptivity and increase the number of formed embryos without increasing the number of oocytes retrieved, suggesting an improvement in oocyte quality. Finally, ozone can alter genes involved in steroidogenesis suggesting that it could improve ovarian function.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Within Finish culture is a strong tradition of sauna bathing. This special environment predisposes the persons refreshing in the sauna to different kind of burns with varying etiologies. Despite the high prevalence of sauna related burns in Finland, there is paucity on the sauna related burns literature. METHODS: In this 13-year retrospective study, all sauna-related contact burns in the adult population treated at the Helsinki Burn Centre were analyzed. Altogether 216 patients were included in this study. RESULTS: The incidence of sauna-related contact burns was significantly higher in males; they accounted for 71.8% of patients. In addition to male gender, another risk factor was high age, with the elderly also being more prone to have a longer length of stay in hospital and more often receiving operative treatment. Despite most burns being relatively small, they were deep and more than one-third (36.6%) of patients underwent surgery. A strong seasonal variation in the injuries was recorded; over 40% of the burns took place during the summer months. CONCLUSION: Sauna contact burns are common, and despite their small size, they frequently cause deep injuries indicating operative treatment. There is a clear male predominance in the patient population. Most probably the cultural aspects of sauna bathing at summer cottages explain the strong seasonal variation in the incidence of these burns. The long latency between initial injury and presentation at the Helsinki Burn Centre should be highlighted to health care centres and central hospitals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of a Finnish sauna on the immune status parameters. The hypothesis was that hyperthermia would improve immune system's functioning by changing the proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations and would activate heat shock proteins. We assumed that the responses of trained and untrained subjects would be different. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Healthy men (20-25 years old) were divided into groups: the trained (T; n = 10), and the untrained group (U; n = 10). All participants were subjected to 10 baths (each one consisted of: 3 × 15-minute exposure with cooled down for 2 min. Body composition, anthropometric measurements, VO2 peak were measured before 1st sauna bath. Blood was collected before the 1st and 10th sauna bath, and 10 min after their completion to asses an acute and a chronic effect. Body mass, rectal temperature and heart rate (HR) were assessed in the same time points. The serum levels of cortisol, Il-6, HSP70 were measured with use of ELISA method, IgA, IgG and IgM by turbidimetry. White blood cells (WBC), leukocyte populations counts: neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils were determined with use of flow cytometry as well as T-cell subpopulations. RESULTS: No differences were found in the increase in rectal temperature, cortisol and immunoglobulins between groups. In response to the 1st sauna bath, a greater increase in HR was observed in the U group. After the last one, the HR value was lower in the T group. The impact of sauna baths on WBC, CD56+, CD3+, CD8+, IgA, IgG and IgM was different in trained and untrained subjects' responses. A positive correlation between the increase in cortisol concentrations and increase in internal temperatures after the 1st sauna was found in the T (r = 0.72) and U group (r = 0.77), between the increase in IL-6 and cortisol concentrations in the T group after the 1st treatment (r = 0.64), between the increase in IL-10 concentration and internal temperature (r = 0.75) and between the increase in IL-6 and IL-10 (r = 0.69) concentrations, also. CONCLUSIONS: Sauna bathing can be a way to improve the immune response, but only when it is undertaken as a series of treatments.",

      "abstract": "PROBLEM: Endometriosis, a common and challenging condition, is a pelvic inflammatory condition that causes chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and infertility. Even though standard medical therapies and surgeries can help CPP, a large percentage of women remain symptomatic following the conventional treatments. Thus, there is a need to study new non-traditional therapeutic adjuncts in this patient population to improve their quality of life. One non-traditional therapeutic agent is Ozone Sauna Therapy (OST) which has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory action, but no studies have been performed to assess the efficacy of OST in women with endometriosis suffering with CPP. Another non-traditional therapeutic agent is Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (PEMF) where one small pilot study has shown that PEMF exposure to women with endometriosis and pelvic pain showed dramatic relief in symptoms. METHOD OF STUDY: The HOCATT machine, by delivering a combination of both OST and PEMF in one machine, has been shown to improve fertility treatment outcome via in vitro fertilization (IVF) in older women by potentially improving oocyte quality. This study was conducted to assess the effect of the HOCATT machine use on the pain scale in patients struggling with CPP due to endometriosis. In the first study, eight women with endometriosis were administered transdermal and intravaginal OST + PEMF, twice a week for 3 weeks (total of 6 sessions). Once a week, the participants were asked to fill a pain scale. In the second study, 10 women were recruited in order to evaluate the changes in serum inflammatory markers following OST + PEMF exposure after 3-week period using the HOCATT machine twice a week (total of 6 sessions). RESULTS: The participants had a mean age of 39.7 ± 1.1 years. The results showed a significant improvement in pain scale following the fourth session (p < .05) and a significant drop in serum levels of the inflammatory markers CRP (p = .0438) and IL-1β (p = .0031) and a significant increase in serum levels of IL-8 (p = .033). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that a combination of OST and PEMF using the HOCATT machine could potentially represent potential therapeutic adjuncts for women with inflammatory disorders such as endometriosis. There is a definite need for larger cohort studies and even randomized trials in order to better assess the efficacy of OST and PEMF in women with other inflammatory disorders.",

      "abstract": "Synthetic pesticides such as organophosphates and pyrethroids are commonly used worldwide yet the metabolic and long-term human health effects of these environmental exposures are unclear. Urinary detections of metabolites involving both classes of insecticides have been documented in various global populations. However, reports documenting similar detections in human sweat are sparse. In this study, the concentrations of four insecticide metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in repeated sweat and urine collections (n = 85) from 10 women undergoing three interventions (control, infrared sauna and indoor bicycling) within a single-blinded randomised crossover trial. The Friedman test with post-hoc two-way analysis of variance, the related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Spearman's rank-order correlation test were used to analyse the results. Organophosphate metabolites were detected in 84.6% (22/26) and pyrethroids in 26.9% (7/26) of the collected sweat samples (pooled per individual, per intervention). Urinary concentrations of three of the four metabolites marginally increased after infrared sauna bathing: 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (z = 2.395, p = 0.017); 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (z = 2.599, p = 0.009); and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (z = 2.090, p = 0.037). Urinary 3-phenoxybenzoic acid also increased after exercise (z = 2.073, p = 0.038) and demonstrated the most temporal variability (days to weeks) of any of the urinary metabolites. Definitive sweat/urine correlations were not demonstrated. These results indicate metabolites from organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides can be detected in human sweat and this raises intriguing questions about perspiration and its role in the metabolism and excretion of synthetic pesticides.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of stimulated diaphoresis to reduce FO with the use of a portable sauna bath. METHODS: Open-label pilot study in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and FO. The primary outcome was the treatment-related adverse events; secondary outcomes were changes in over-hydration (OH), body weight and blood pressure, FO symptoms, and sleep quality. Dialysis prescription and daily data were recorded. The intervention period consisted in a 30-min, 45°C sauna bath, daily for 10 days, using a portable sauna bath. RESULTS: Fifty-one out of 54 total sauna bath sessions were well tolerated. In three (5.5%) sessions adverse effects were reported: transient dizziness in two cases, and a second-degree skin burn in a patient with advanced diabetic neuropathy. OH (6.3 ± 1.2 L vs. 5.5 ± 1.3 L, p = 0.05), body weight (67.7 ± 11.4 vs. 66.8 ± 3.8 kg, p = 0.003), diastolic blood pressure (92 ± 13.5 vs. 83 ± 13.3 mmHg, P = 0.003) and PSQI score (7.3 ± 3.7 vs. 5.1 ± 3.2, p = 0.02) improved significantly between the control and intervention period, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulated diaphoresis with a portable sauna bath could be a novel, safe, and effective alternative way to reduce FO in CAPD patients. Larger studies are needed to confirm our results.

      "abstract": "Regular exercise and sauna bathing have each been shown to improve cardiovascular function in clinical populations. However, experimental data on the cardiovascular adaptations to regular exercise in conjunction with sauna bathing in the general population are lacking. Therefore, we compared the effects of exercise and sauna bathing to regular exercise using a multi-arm randomized controlled trial. Participants (n = 47) aged 49 ± 9 with low physical activity levels and at least one traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to guideline-based regular exercise and 15-min postexercise sauna (EXS), guideline-based regular exercise (EXE), or control (CON) for 8 wk. The primary outcomes were blood pressure (BP) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Secondary outcomes included fat mass, total cholesterol levels, and arterial stiffness. EXE had a greater change in CRF (+6.2 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, +4.2 to +8.3 mL/kg/min) and fat mass but no differences in BP when compared with CON. EXS displayed greater change in CRF (+2.7 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, +0.2 to +5.3 mL/kg/min), lower systolic BP (-8.0 mmHg; 95% CI, -14.6 to -1.4 mmHg), and lower total cholesterol levels compared with EXE. Regular exercise improved CRF and body composition in sedentary adults with CVD risk factors. However, when combined with exercise, sauna bathing demonstrated a substantially supplementary effect on CRF, systolic BP, and total cholesterol levels. Sauna bathing is a valuable lifestyle tool that complements exercise for improving CRF and decreasing systolic BP. Future research should focus on the duration and frequency of exposure to ascertain the dose-response relationship.",

This study evaluated the effects of post-exercise sauna bathing in young men undergoing endurance training on gut bacteria inflammation and intestinal barrier function. METHODS: Fifteen (15) untrained males aged 22 ± 1.5 years were randomly assigned to exercise training (ET) with or without post-exercise sauna treatments (S). Participants in the group ET + S (n = 8) exercised 60 min, 3 times per week, on a bicycle ergometer followed by a 30-min dry Finish sauna treatment. The control group (ET, n = 7) engaged in the same exercise training program without the sauna treatments. Blood and stool samples were collected before and after the 4-week training program. Blood samples were analysed for the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and complete blood counts. Stool samples were analysed for pH, quantitative and qualitative measures of targeted bacteria, zonulin, and secretory immunoglobulin A. RESULTS: Interaction effects revealed no differences in the pattern of change over time between groups for the abundance of selected gut microbiome bacteria and stool pH, zonulin, sIgA, and hsCRP. Pre- and post-study fecal concentrations of Bifidobacterium spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Akkermansia muciniphila were below reference values for these bacteria in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 4-weeks exercise followed by passive heat exposure did not have a measurable influence on targeted gut microbiota, intestinal barrier function, and hsCRP levels in young males.

We evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of SINA 1.2 therapy protocol derived from Persian medicine in an asthmatic mice model. Forty-two male BALB/c mice divided into six groups: one control (sham) and five sensitized groups (by parenteral injection of 20 μg ovalbumin in 100 μL normal saline plus 50 μL alum on days 1 and 14). Sensitized groups were as: untreated, budesonide (1 mg nebulized budesonide: 200 μg/puff every 5 min for 25 min), dry sauna (30 min, 37°C), oral oxymel (gavaged: 0.2 mL of the syrup plus 0.8 mL of water), and SINA protocol No.1.2 (oxymel followed by sauna) groups. Treatments were given for 10 days from day 23 to 33 then sacrificed. Significant gene expression reduction of interleukin(IL)-4, IL-5, and MUC5AC and increase of interferon(IFN)-γ and IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio and decreased perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and subsequent mucus hypersecretion in SINA group were seen compared to untreated group. SINA lowered IL-5 and MUC5AC gene expression levels similar to the budesonide and acted better than budesonide in increasing IFN-γ gene expression up to normal level. Compared with the asthma group, sauna alone only affected MUC5AC and IFN-γ gene expressions and oxymel alone, only reduced IL-4 gene expression, perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, and mucus hypersecretion. It seems that SINA therapy alleviates asthma via immune modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improvement of pathological changes in ovalbumin-induced asthma in mice, supporting the notion of innate healing power mentioned in Persian medicine literature.",

A recent 20-year prospective study revealed an association between moderate to high frequency of Finnish sauna bathing and a lower incidence of dementia and AD, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these benefits remain uncertain. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sauna-like conditions could lower tau phosphorylation by increasing body temperature. We observed a decrease in tau phosphorylation in wild-type and hTau mice as well as in neuron-like cells when exposed to higher temperatures. These effects were correlated with specific changes in phosphatase and kinase activities, but not with inflammatory or heat shock responses. We also used a drug strategy to promote thermogenesis: topical application of menthol, which led to a sustained increase in body temperature in hTau mice, concomitant with a significant decrease in tau phosphorylation. Our results suggest that sauna-like conditions or menthol treatment could lower tau pathology through mild hyperthermia, and may provide promising therapeutic strategies for AD and other tauopathies.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of sauna bathing on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in a Finnish population-based cohort. METHODS: A mail survey was sent to a population-based cohort of 50-, 60-, and 70-year-old men in 1994 followed by repeat questionnaires in 1999 and 2004. The evaluation of ten different types of LUTS was based on Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS-1). The weekly frequency of sauna bathing was assessed in the first questionnaire and divided into three subgroups (0-1, 2, and ≥3). The prevalence, incidence, and remission rate of each LUTS was assessed based on the initial and follow-up assessments. In addition, the mean DAN-PSS-1 symptoms score, medication for LUTS, and operative treatment were determined at each time-point. Chi-square test, a linear-by-linear test, and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: The population-based cohort included initially 3,163, men of whom 1,306 (41.3%) responded to all three questionnaire rounds and were included in the analysis. There was no clear association between sauna bathing frequency and prevalence of the nine LUTS, nor with incidence and remission rates. The only exception was feelings of incomplete emptying, with lower prevalence associated with frequent sauna bathing. There were no clear differences in the medications or operations for LUTS by sauna bathing habits. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, sauna bathing does not affect LUTS development or natural history in the long-term.",

We examined the effects of post-exercise sauna bathing on hematological adaptations and exercise capacity in healthy men. Methods: Thirteen physical education students participated in randomized cross-over study: two, 4-week interventions, with 10-week washout. The interventions involved 3 times per week 60-min stationary cycling either with 30-min of post-exercise sauna bathing (89 ± 3°C, 10 ± 2% RH) or without; no fluid was ingested during both exercise and sauna sessions. Before and after both interventions, participants were tested for total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass), intravascular volumes, erythropoietin, ferritin, red blood cell parameters with reticulocyte fractions, along with maximal/peak and submaximal variables in a graded exercise test (GXT). Results: Regardless of intervention type, tHb-mass increased (p = .014) whereas ferritin concentration decreased (p = .027); however, changes in tHb-mass were within the range of typical error (<1.8%). Absolute and relative values of maximal power and power at gas exchange threshold, as well as peak oxygen uptake (all p < .010), also increased irrespective of intervention type. Conclusions: The use of post-exercise sauna bathing with fluid intake restrictions does not provide any additional benefits in tested variables over endurance training alone. Thus, further evidence is required before recommendations to utilize this post-exercise conditioning strategy are deemed valid.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sauna bathing and aerobic exercise have each been shown to affect cardiovascular function. However, direct comparisons between standalone sauna bathing and a combination of exercise and sauna on vascular indices remain limited. Therefore, we conducted a cross-over study using matched durations to explore the hemodynamic changes of sauna exposure when compared to a combination of aerobic exercise and sauna exposure. METHODS: Participants (N = 72) with at least one cardiovascular risk factor underwent, on two separate occasions: (a) a 30-minute sauna at 75°C (SAUNA) and (b) the combination of a 15-minute cycling exercise at 75% maximum heart rate followed by 15-minute sauna exposure (EX+SAUNA). Relative changes to arterial stiffness (PWV), augmentation index (Alx), brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), central SBP (cSBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were compared PRE-POST and pre- to 30-minutes post-intervention (PRE-POST30). RESULTS: Baseline SBP and DBP were 143 (SD 18) mmHg and 86 (SD 10) mmHg, respectively. From PRE-POST, SAUNA had lower DBP (mean difference [95% CI] 2.5 [1.0, 4.1], P = .002) and MAP (2.5 [0.6, 4.3], P = .01). However, EX+SAUNA had lower SBP (-2.7 [-4.8, -0.5], P = .02), DBP (-1.8 [-3.3, -0.4], P = .01), and MAP (-2.0 [-3.5, -0.5], P = .009) PRE-POST30. There were no statistically significant differences between SAUNA and EX+SAUNA for other measured parameters. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that when matched for duration, EX+SAUNA and SAUNA elicit comparable acute hemodynamic alterations in middle-aged participants with cardiovascular risk factors. The sauna is a suitable option for acute blood pressure reductions in those who are unable to perform aerobic exercise, and may be a viable lifestyle treatment option to improve blood pressure control."

      "abstract": "This manuscript aims to evaluate the influence of a novel passive heat acclimation program among human participants in the physical performance, as well as in several physiological parameters. 36 male football players were acclimated using a dry sauna bath to extreme hot (100 ± 3 °C), performing a total of nine sauna sessions with a weekly frequency of three sessions. The players were randomly into the sauna group (SG; n = 18; age: 20.69 ± 2.09 years) and the control group (CG; n = 18; age: 20.23 ± 1.98 years). All participants performed maximal effort test until exhaustion as well as hamstring flexibility test before and after the acclimation program. Anthropometric, respiratory, circulatory, hematological and physiological variables were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the survey. Statistical analysis consisted of a Mann-Whitney U test to determine differences between groups at the beginning and at the end of the survey and a Wilcoxon test for paired samples to compare the differences for each group separately. Additionally, size effects of the pre-post acclimation changes were calculated. After the acclimation program SG participants experienced a diminution in body weight (p < 0.01), body mass index (p < 0.01), body fat (p < 0.05) and fat percentage (p < 0.05) decreased. Hamstring flexibility (p < 0.05) and work capacity (p < 0.05) increased. External basal temperature decreased (p < 0.05) as well as post-exercise systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p < 0.05). Finally, maximal oxygen uptake (ml Kg-1 min-1) (p < 0.05), maximal minute ventilation (p < 0.05) and maximal breath frequency (p < 0.05) increased at the end of the intervention. There were no significant changes in the CG in any variable. Favorable adaptations have been observed in this survey, suggesting a beneficial effect of extreme heat acclimation on physical performance. Several of the observed responses seem interesting for sport performance and health promotion as well. However, this is a novel, extreme protocol which requires further research.",

METHODS: Twenty-six trained runners (16 female; mean ± SD, age 19 ± 1 years, V̇O2max F: 52.6 ± 6.9 mL⋅kg-1⋅min-1, M: 64.6 ± 2.4 mL⋅kg-1⋅min-1) performed a running heat tolerance test (30 min, 9 km⋅h-1/2% gradient, 40 °C/40%RH; HTT) and temperate (18 °C) exercise tests (maximal aerobic capacity [V̇O2max] and lactate profile) pre and post 3 weeks of normal exercise training plus 29 ± 1 min post-exercise sauna bathing (101-108 °C) 3 ± 1 times per week. RESULTS: Females and males exhibited similar reductions (interactions p > 0.05) in peak rectal temperature (- 0.3 °C; p < 0.001), skin temperature (- 0.9 °C; p < 0.001) and heart rate (- 9 beats·min-1; p = 0.001) during the HTT at post- vs pre-intervention. Only females exhibited an increase in active sweat glands on the forearm (measured via modified iodine technique; F: + 57%, p < 0.001; M: + 1%, p = 0.47). Conversely, only males increased forearm blood flow (measured via venous occlusion plethysmography; F: + 31%, p = 0.61; M: + 123%; p < 0.001). Females and males showed similar (interactions p > 0.05) improvements in V̇O2max (+ 5%; p = 0.02) and running speed at 4 mmol·L-1 blood lactate concentration (+ 0.4 km·h-1; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks of post-exercise sauna bathing effectively induces heat acclimation in females and males, though possibly amid different thermoeffector adaptations. Post-exercise sauna bathing is also an effective ergogenic aid for both sexes."

High-stress occupations (HSO: firefighters, police, military personnel, first responders, etc.) increase the risk of developing CMD because they expose individuals to chronic and multiple stressors (i.e., sleep deprivation, poor nutrition habits, lack of physical activity, psychological stress). Interestingly, heat exposure and, more specifically, sauna bathing have been shown to improve multiple markers of CMD, potentially acting as hormetic stressors, at the cellular level and in the whole organism. Therefore, sauna bathing might be a practical and alternative intervention for disease prevention for individuals with HSO. The purpose of this review is to detail the mechanisms and pathways involved in the response to both acute and chronic sauna bathing and collectively present sauna bathing as a potential treatment, in addition to current standard of care, for mitigating CMD to both clinicians and individuals serving in HSO.",

To explore these putative roles, we evaluated the independent and joint associations of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and frequency of sauna bathing (FSB) with pneumonia risk in a prospective cohort study of 2275 men aged 42-61 years at recruitment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Objectively measured CRF and self-reported sauna bathing habits were assessed at baseline. CRF was categorized as low and high (median cut-offs) and FSB as low and high (defined as ≤1 and 2-7 sessions/wk, respectively). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for incident pneumonia. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 26.6 years, 529 cases of pneumonia occurred. Comparing high vs low CRF, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CIs) for pneumonia was 0.75 (0.61-0.91). Comparing high vs low FSB, the corresponding HR was 0.81 (0.68-0.97). Compared to men with low CRF & low FSB, the multivariable-adjusted HRs of pneumonia for the following groups: high CRF & low FSB; low CRF & high FSB; and high CRF & high FSB were 0.88 (0.65-1.20), 0.89 (0.71-1.13), and 0.62 (0.48-0.80) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a general male Caucasian population, a combination of high fitness levels and frequent sauna baths is associated with a substantially lowered future pneumonia risk compared with each modality alone. The implications of these findings in altering COVID-19 disease or its severity deserve study.",

METHODS: Twenty middle-distance runners (13 female; mean ± SD, age 20 ± 2 years, [Formula: see text]O2max 56.1 ± 8.7 ml kg-1 min-1) performed a running heat tolerance test (30-min, 9 km h-1/2% gradient, 40 °C/40%RH; HTT) and temperate (18 °C) exercise tests (maximal aerobic capacity [[Formula: see text]O2max], speed at 4 mmol L-1 blood lactate concentration ([La-]) before (Pre) and following three-weeks (3-Weeks) normal training (CON; n = 8) or normal training with 28 ± 2 min post-exercise sauna bathing (101-108 °C, 5-10%RH) 3 ± 1 times per week (SAUNA; n = 12). Changes from Pre to 3-Weeks were compared between-groups using an analysis of co-variance. Six SAUNA participants continued the intervention for 7 weeks, completing an additional HTT (7-Weeks; data compared using a one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance). RESULTS: During the HTT, SAUNA reduced peak rectal temperature (Trec; - 0.2 °C), skin temperature (- 0.8 °C), and heart rate (- 11 beats min-1) more than CON at 3-Weeks compared to Pre (all p < 0.05). SAUNA also improved [Formula: see text]O2max (+ 0.27 L-1 min-1; p = 0.02) and speed at 4 mmol L-1 [La-] (+ 0.6 km h-1; p = 0.01) more than CON at 3-Weeks compared to Pre. Only peak Trec (- 0.1 °C; p = 0.03 decreased further from 3-Weeks to 7-Weeks in SAUNA (other physiological variables p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Three-weeks post-exercise sauna bathing is an effective and pragmatic method of heat acclimation, and an effective ergogenic aid. Extending the intervention to seven weeks only marginally improved Trec.",

The acute physiological responses elicited by Finnish sauna bathing that could explain this association remain understudied. This study characterized the acute effect of Finnish sauna bathing on circulating markers of inflammation in healthy middle-aged and older adults. DESIGN: With the use of a crossover study design, 20 healthy middle-aged and older adults (9 men/11 women, 66 ± 6 years old) performed 3 interventions in random order: 1) 1 x 10 min of Finnish sauna bathing (80 °C, 20 % humidity); 2) 2 x 10 min of Finnish sauna bathing; 3) a time-control period during which participants sat outside of the sauna for 10 min. MAIN OUTCOMES: Venous blood samples were obtained before (≤15 min) and after (∼65 min) each intervention to determine circulating concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: IL-6 increased in response to 2 x 10 min of sauna bathing (+0.92 pg/mL [+0.16, +1.68], P = 0.02), but not following the 1 x 10 min session (+0.17 pg/mL [-0.13, +0.47], P = 0.26). IL1-RA increased during the 1 x 10 min (+51.27 pg/mL [+20.89, +81.65], P < 0.01) and 2 x 10 min (+30.78 pg/mL [+3.44, +58.12], P = 0.03) sessions. CRP did not change in response to either sauna session (P = 0.34). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that typical Finnish sauna bathing sessions acutely increase IL-6 and IL1-RA in healthy middle-aged and older adults.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The role of sauna bathing in cardiovascular function treatment has been increasingly explored, but insufficient attention has been paid to its efficacy. We performed a meta-analysis to provide more evidence for the efficacy of sauna treatment in cardiovascular nursing. METHODS: Sixteen peer-reviewed journal articles were screened to summarize the efficacy of the sauna on cardiovascular function. Both acute (0-30 min after the sauna) and short-term (2-4 weeks following the sauna treatment) efficacies were investigated. RESULTS: For pooled acute efficacy, body temperature and heart rate significantly (p<0.001) grew by 0.94℃ and 17.86 beats/min, respectively; reductions of 5.55 mmHg (p<0.001) and 6.50 mmHg (p<0.001) were also observed in systolic blood pressure and diastole blood pressure, respectively. For combined short-term efficacy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 6-min walk distance, and flow-mediated dilation (p<0.001) increased by 3.27%, 48.11 m, and 1.71%, respectively; greater amelioration in LVEF was observed in participants with lower LVEF. The proportion of patients with New York Heart Association class III and IV decreased by 10.9% and 12.2%, respectively. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, brain natriuretic peptide concentration, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, cardiothoracic ratio, and left atrial dimension reduced by 5.26 mmHg (p<0.001), 4.14 mmHg (p<0.001), 116.66 pg/mL (p<0.001), 2.79 mm (p<0.001), 2.628% (p<0.05), and 1.88 mm (p<0.05), respectively, while the concentration of norepinephrine in the plasma remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Sauna treatment was found to play a positive role in improving cardiovascular function and physical activity levels, especially in patients with low cardiovascular function. These findings reveal that thermal intervention may be a promising means for cardiovascular nursing.",

This study aimed to determine whether dry sauna therapy improved the quality of life of obese people. METHODS: A total of 38 consecutive participants aged over 20 years with a body mass index of ≥25 kg/m2 were recruited for the study. The participants were treated with a 90°C dry sauna for 15 minutes, twice daily for 4 consecutive days. To assess the quality of life, all participants completed the 5 level EQ-5D questionnaires and the EQ-Visual Analog Scale. Study parameters were measured on the same day prior to commencing the sauna sessions in a fasted state and 2 days after the last sauna session. RESULTS: The average age was 62.3±9.5 years; 84.2% of the participants were female. The mean body mass index was 28.5±2.4 kg/m2. Dry sauna significantly improved the mean 5 level EQ-5D index scores from 0.83±0.12 to 0.89±0.11 and increased the mean EQ-Visual Analog Scale from 79.0±15.2 to 91.1±9.7. However, there were no significant changes in body mass index, blood pressure, heart rate, or body composition before and after the 8-session sauna therapy. CONCLUSION: Dry sauna improved the health-related quality of life of obese patients without adverse events. Further clinical studies in larger study populations are needed to verify these findings and provide concrete evidence for obesity treatment."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on healthy males (aged 20-25 years), representing the training (T, N = 10) and non-training groups (NT, N = 10). The protocol included a series of 10 sauna baths during 3 weeks. One bath consisted of three 15-min sessions, with 2 min recovery. Before the first and the 10th treatment, measurements of body composition, blood pressure, rectal temperature, and plasma concentrations of the total pro-oxidative and antioxidative status, 3-nitrotyrosine and NOx were performed. RESULTS: A significant increase in physiological parameters during sauna treatments, as well as a significant decrease in the total antioxidative status before the 10th bath, were observed in both groups. The series of sauna baths caused a significant increase in the total antioxidative status in the T group, and a decrease in the total oxidative status in the NT group. A significant decrease in 3-nitrotyrosine in both groups before the last treatment, and also in the T group after the last treatment, was noted. In both groups, a significant increase in NOx concentrations was observed after the first bath. CONCLUSIONS: A series of sauna baths contributes to the improvement in the prooxidative/ antioxidative balance. The increased production of nitric oxide may lead to a better vascular relaxation and blood flow. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2020;33(2):173-85.",

The aim of the current study was to investigate acute effects of SAU bathing after an intensive training session on recovery of swim performance. METHODS: In total, 20 competitive swimmers and triathletes (3 female and 17 male) with a minimum of 2 y of competition experience (national level or higher) participated in the study. Athletes completed an intensive training session followed by either a SAU bathing intervention or a placebo (PLAC) condition in a randomized order. SAU consisted of 3 × 8 min of SAU bathing at 80-85°C, whereas during PLAC, athletes applied a deidentified, pH-balanced massage oil while passively resting in a seated position. Prior to training, swimmers conducted a 4 × 50-m all-out swim test that was repeated on the following morning. Furthermore, subjective ratings of fatigue and recovery were measured. RESULTS: Swimmers performed significantly worse after SAU (4 × 50-m pre-post difference: +1.69 s) than after PLAC (-0.66 s; P = .02), with the most pronounced decrease in the first 50 m (P = .04; +2.7%). Overall performance of 15 athletes deteriorated (+2.6 s). The subjective feeling of stress was significantly higher after SAU than after PLAC (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Based on published findings, the smallest substantial change in swimming performance is an increase in time of more than 1.2 s; thus, the observed reductions appear relevant for competitive swimmers. According to the current results, coaches and athletes should be careful with postexercise SAU if high-intensity training and/or competitions are scheduled on the following day."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether dry sauna therapy improved quality of life and reduced pain in participants with low back pain. METHODS: Study participants comprised a total of 37 consecutive patients who were over 20 years of age with low back pain. Dry sauna therapy was performed twice per day for 5 consecutive days over the course of 1 week, thus comprising a total of 10 sessions each of 15 min of exposure to a 90°C dry sauna. RESULTS: The verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores were significantly reduced after dry sauna therapy (P < 0.001 for both). VNRS pain scores had a median (range) of 5 (2-8) before dry sauna therapy and 3 (0-8) after dry sauna therapy. ODI scores had a median (range) of 12 (2-24) before dry sauna therapy and 8 (1-17) after dry sauna therapy. The proportion of participants who reported successful treatment (excellent + good) was 70%. No adverse effects were observed related to dry sauna therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that dry sauna therapy may be useful to improve quality of life and reduce pain in patients with low back pain. Therefore, pain physicians can recommend dry sauna therapy as an alternative and complimentary therapy for patients with low back pain."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are differences between dry and wet sauna baths because of the heat load and human body's reactions. High humidity in a wet sauna makes evaporation of sweat from the skin surface more difficult. In addition, the dynamics of sweating is different in men and women. The aim of the study was to assess changes in physiological indicators and to compare the impact of dry and wet saunas on the thermal comfort feeling, which was assessed using the Bedford thermal scale, and the physiological strain index (PSI) and the cumulative heat stress index (CHSI) in young healthy women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten women aged 22-24 years took part in the study. A session in each sauna lasted 60 min and consisted of 3 thermal 15-min exposures, in 5-min intervals for rest and cooling with water. The temperature in the dry sauna was 91±1.2°C and in the wet sauna 59±1.3°C, while the humidity was 18±0.7% and 60.5±0.8%, respectively. Body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (Tre) and the thermal sensation (Bedford scale) were also measured. The PSI and CHSI values were both calculated. RESULTS: The average weight loss after a dry sauna bath was significantly higher than after a wet sauna bath. Significantly higher increases in Tre, as well as in HR were observed after treatment in the wet sauna, compared to the dry sauna. Both treatments resulted in an increase in SBP and a decrease in DBP. The arduousness of thermal discomfort and the levels of PSI and CHSI were skurgreater in the wet sauna bathing than in the dry sauna. CONCLUSIONS: Heat exposure in the wet sauna creates a greater burden for young women's bodies than the same dry sauna treatment, and the changes observed in the examined traits were higher than in men subjected to similar thermal loads.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests that heat therapy can be used to prevent and treat cancer; anecdotal reports suggest passive heat therapies may increase cancer risk. Finnish sauna bathing has been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, but its association with cancer risk is unknown. We aimed to assess the prospective association between frequency of sauna bathing and the risk of all-cause and site-specific cancers using the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease prospective cohort. METHODS: Baseline sauna bathing habits were assessed in 2173 men aged 42-61 years with no history of cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. We corrected for within-person variability in sauna bathing habits using data from repeat assessments taken 11 years apart. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 24.3 years, 588 (27.1%) all-cause cancer cases were recorded. The age-adjusted regression dilution ratio of sauna bathing frequency was 0.69 (0.62-0.76). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, the HRs (95% CIs) of all-cause cancer were 0.92 (0.76-1.11) and 0.92 (0.66-1.27) for men who had 2-3 and ≥4 sauna sessions per week, respectively, compared with men who had ≤1 sauna session per week. The non-significant findings were consistent for prostate, gastrointestinal and lung cancers on multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSION: Frequent Finnish sauna bathing is not associated with the risk of cancer in a middle-aged male Caucasian population. Further studies are required to confirm or refute these findings, particularly in women and other age groups.",

Thus, the aim of this two-armed randomized controlled pilot trial was to investigate whether sauna yoga at a moderate temperature (50 °C) beneficially affects flexibility, strength, balance, and quality of life (QOL) in healthy elderly community dwellers. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (INT, n = 11, age: 68.7 ± 5.9) or control group (CON, n = 12, age: 69.3 ± 4.9), using the minimization method. Age, physical activity, gender, and the primary outcome flexibility were used as strata for group allocation. Both groups completed similar exercises in the sauna over eight weeks. Only the INT group was exposed to moderate temperatures of 50 °C. Large and statistically significant improvement in favor of the sauna group (INT) was observed for the chair sit-and-reach test (INT: +83%, CON +3%, p = 0.028, nр² = 0.24). The shoulder and lateral spine flexibility were not relevantly affected. Strength in the lower extremities merely showed a tendency to significant changes (INT: 16%, CON: 3%, p = 0.061, nр² = 0.181). Additionally, balance abilities, with eyes closed, improved (INT: 187%, CON +58%, p = 0.056, nр² = 0.189) in favor of the INT group. QOL only improved in favor of the INT for environmental dimension (INT: +7%, CON: 0%, p = 0.034, nр² = 0.227). These first but preliminary findings indicate that sauna yoga may serve as a promising and feasible means to improve flexibility in elderly people. Strength and balance do not meaningfully benefit from a sauna environment, although strength improved to a slightly higher extent in the sauna group. Future large-scale research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms and corroborate these findings.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sauna bathing is becoming a common activity in many countries and it has been linked to favorable health outcomes. However, there is limited data on the heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) responses to an acute sauna exposure. DESIGN: We conducted a single-group, longitudinal study utilizing a pre-post design to examine acute effects of sauna bathing on the autonomic nervous system as reflected by HRV. A total of 93 participants (mean [SD] age: 52.0 [8.8] years, 53.8% males) with cardiovascular risk factors were exposed to a single sauna session (duration: 30 min; temperature: 73 °C; humidity: 10-20%) and data on HRV variables were collected before, during and after sauna. RESULTS: Time and frequency-domain HRV variables were significantly modified (p < 0.001) by the single sauna session, with most of HRV variables tending to return near to baseline values after 30 min recovery. Resting HR was lower at the end of recovery (68/min) compared to pre-sauna (77/min). A sauna session transiently diminished the vagal component, whereas the cooling down period after sauna decreased low frequency power (p < 0.001) and increased high frequency power in HRV (p < 0.001), favorably modulating the autonomic nervous system balance. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a session of sauna bathing induces an increase in HR. During the cooling down period from sauna bathing, HRV increased which indicates the dominant role of parasympathetic activity and decreased sympathetic activity of cardiac autonomic nervous system. Future randomized controlled studies are needed to show if HR and HRV changes underpins the long-term cardiovascular effects induced by regular sauna bathing.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sauna-bathing is an ancient tradition that is gaining popularity across the world as a wellness tool. There is a growing body of medical evidence supporting the role of saunas, or whole-body thermotherapy, as a form of treatment for a range of health issues. However, the demographics, motivations and experiences of current sauna bathers have not yet been explored on a global scale. This study is designed to explore these themes. DESIGN: An online 71-item questionnaire compiling information on the individual characteristics, sauna-related habits and perceived health and wellness experiences of regular sauna bathers was conducted from October 2016 to October 2017. The validated 'SF-12' quality of life scoring tool was incorporated into the questionnaire to measure physical and mental indicators of well-being. RESULTS: Of 572 logins recorded, 482 valid responses were generated. Both men (51.3%) and women (48.7%) were represented, and respondents were predominantly well-educated (81.8%), non-smoking (90.6%), regularly-exercising (78.8%) individuals of normal-to-overweight status (87.1%) who sauna-bathed approximately 1-2 times per week. The key reasons indicated by respondents for sauna-bathing included relaxation/stress reduction, pain relief and socializing. Nearly a third of respondents reported medical conditions and of this subset, those with back/musculoskeletal pain and mental issues cited the greatest improvements in their conditions with sauna-bathing. Of all respondents, 83.5% reported sleep benefits after sauna use. Analysis of well-being scores after stratifying respondents into three groups by sauna-bathing frequency (group I: <5 times per month; group II: 5-15 times per month; group III: >15 times per month) revealed group II respondents had slightly higher mental well-being scores (Kruskal-Wallis testing: H = 6.603 > ꭔ2 of 5.991, p = 0.0368, df = 2 with post hoc analysis using Mann-Whitney U test: p = 0.016) as compared to respondents who were sauna-bathing less frequently (group I). No respective differences were detected between the physical well-being scores of any of the three groups. Adverse reactions to sauna-bathing were recorded as mostly minor (93.1%), including primarily symptoms of dizziness, dehydration and headache. However, there were two reports (0.3%) of chest pain and eye irritation requiring hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study documents that sauna-bathing participants, particularly those from Finland, Australia and the United States, are motivated to use saunas predominantly for relaxation, reporting health benefits especially around mental well-being and sleep, with relatively few adverse effects. While these results reinforce some of the known health benefits of sauna bathing, they indicate that further research and better dissemination of existing evidence is needed to fully develop the sauna's potential as a therapeutic intervention.",

AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of sauna bathing on the physiological parameters of young overweight, physically inactive men and to test the correlations between physiological parameters versus anthropometric features and body composition parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five overweight and sedentary men aged 20.76±2.4 y were exposed to four sauna sessions of 10 minutes each (temperature: 90-91°C; relative humidity: 14-16 %) with four 5-minute cool-down breaks. Body composition was determined before sauna, and body mass and blood pressure were measured before and after sauna. Physiological parameters were monitored during four 10-minute sauna sessions. RESULTS: A significant (p<0.0001) increase in all analyzed physiological parameters was observed during four successive 10-minute sauna sessions. Heart rate, energy expenditure, blood pressure, and body mass loss were most strongly correlated with anthropometric parameters (body mass, body mass index, and body surface area) and body composition parameters (percent body fat, body fat mass, and visceral fat level). The 60-minute treatment resulted in a significant reduction in body mass (0.65 kg). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated use of Finnish sauna induces significant changes in the physiological parameters of young sedentary overweight men, and these changes are intensified during successive treatments. Deleterious cardiovascular adaptations were most prevalent in men characterized by the highest degree of obesity and the largest body size.",

It is important to analyze the current evidence to help suggest paths of future study and potential for clinical application. HYPOTHESIS: Sauna bath has a positive effect on HF patients. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases were searched to identify randomized and nonrandomized controlled studies to compare effects of sauna bath with no sauna bath. Studies were searched for both infrared sauna bath and Finnish sauna bath. The strength of evidence was rated using a modified GRADE approach. Out of 1444 studies, nine met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Seven of these nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Only studies with infrared sauna bath met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: In the meta-analysis, exposure to an infrared sauna bath in 60°C for 15 minutes, followed by a 30-minute rest in warm environment, five times a week for 2 to 4 weeks, was associated with a significant reduction in B-type natriuretic peptide, cardiothoracic ratio, and an improvement in left-ventricular ejection fraction. There was no significant effect on left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left atrial diameter, systolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure. The strength of evidence varied from moderate to insufficient. CONCLUSION: Infrared sauna bath was associated with short-term improvement in cardiac function. More evidence is needed about long-term effects of sauna bath and the effects of a Finnish sauna on cardiovascular health among patients with HF or other cardiovascular diseases.",

We evaluated the safety and preliminary health benefits of a unique chemical exposure regimen based on exercise, sauna and therapeutic nutrients. METHODS: This was a prospective evaluation of 109 individuals sequentially enrolled into a sauna detoxification component of a multi-modal, long-term residential substance abuse treatment centre. RESULTS: Data from medical charts, client self-reports and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) responses indicated that the Hubbard sauna detoxification method was well tolerated, with a 99% completion rate, including one human immunodeficiency virus and nine hepatitis C positive clients. There were no cases of dehydration, overhydration or heat illness. Statistically significant improvements were seen in both mental and physical SF-36 scores at regimen completion, as well as in Addiction Severity Index and Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Short Screener change scores at rehabilitation program discharge, compared with enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: The regimen lacked serious adverse events, had a very low discontinuation rate and high client-reported satisfaction. The SF-36 data indicated improved physical and emotional symptoms. Therefore, broader investigation of this sauna-based treatment regimen is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Sauna-type bathing has increased worldwide, and it has been related to both harmful and beneficial effects. There are few studies of bathing in sauna in very old age. METHODS: The series consists of 524 mostly home-living survivors of the Helsinki Businessmen Study (HBS, mean age 86 years, range 80-95), who in 2015 responded to a questionnaire survey about lifestyle (including sauna bathing), prevalent diseases, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL, RAND-36). RESULTS: Of the men 57.6% (n = 302) reported all-year round and 17.6% (n = 92) part-year sauna bathing. Sauna was currently used mostly once a week, but 10% bathed more than twice a week. Median time in the hot room was 15 min at 80 °C. Among 45.7% of the men, the habit had decreased with ageing, and 130 (24.8%) did not attend sauna. However, 92.2% of the latter had discontinued an earlier habit, respective proportions 20.7% and 75.0% among all-year and part-year users. Overall, reasons for decreased sauna bathing were nonspecific or related to mobility problems or diverse health reasons (n = 63). The most frequent motivations for sauna were relaxation and hygienic reasons. Of the RAND-36 domains physical function, vitality, social functioning, and general health were significantly better among sauna users than non-users. These differences partly remained after adjusting for prevalent diseases and mobility-disability. CONCLUSIONS: Regular sauna bathing was common among octogenarian men and was associated with better HRQoL. However, reverse causality must be taken into account in this cross-sectional study. The bathing habit seemed to be prudent and had decreased in almost half of the cohort.",

      "abstract": "Background Heat therapy has been suggested to improve cardiovascular function. However, the effects of hot sauna exposure on arterial compliance and the dynamics of blood flow and pressure have not been well documented. Thus, we investigated the short-term effects of sauna bathing on arterial stiffness and haemodynamics. Design The design was an experimental non-randomised study. Methods There were 102 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 51.9 years) who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Participants were exposed to a single sauna session (duration: 30 min; temperature: 73℃; humidity: 10-20%). Pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, heart rate, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, augmented pressure and left ventricular ejection time were assessed before, immediately after, and 30 min after a single sauna session. Results Sauna bathing led to reductions in pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and left ventricular ejection time. Mean pulse wave velocity value before sauna was 9.8 m/s and decreased to 8.6 m/s immediately after sauna bathing ( p < 0.001 for difference), and was 9.0 m/s after the 30-minute recovery period ( p < 0.001 for analysis of variance). Systolic blood pressure was 137 mm Hg before sauna bathing, decreasing to 130 mm Hg after sauna ( p < 0.001), which remained sustained during the 30-minute recovery phase ( p < 0.001 for analysis of variance). After a single sauna session, diastolic blood pressure decreased from 82 to 75 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure from 99.4 to 93.6 mm Hg and left ventricular ejection time from 307 to 278 m/s ( p < 0.001 for all differences). Pulse pressure was 42.7 mm Hg before the sauna, 44.9 mm Hg immediately after the sauna, and reduced to 39.3 mm Hg after 30-minutes recovery ( p < 0.001 for analysis of variance). Heart rate increased from 65 to 81 beats/min post-sauna ( p < 0.001); there were no significant changes for augmented pressure and pulse pressure amplification. Conclusion This study shows that pulse wave velocity, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular ejection time and diastolic time decreased immediately after a 30-minute sauna session. Decreases in systolic blood pressure and left ventricular ejection time were sustained during the 30-minute recovery phase.",

HIV risks and risk perception were evaluated through an anonymous survey. HIV testing with result notification and care appointment arrangement were provided on-site. Of the 358 participants; median age was 30 years; 206/358(58%) were at high risk for HIV acquisition; 148/358(41%) accepted HTC, all of whom either had prior negative HIV tests [98/148 (66%)] or had not known their HIV status [50/148 (34%)]. The three most common reasons for declining HTC were prior HIV testing within 6 months (48%), not ready (19%) and perceiving self as no risk (11%). Of the 262 moderate- and high-risk participants, 172 (66%) had false perception of low HIV risk which was significantly associated with declining HTC. Among the 148 participants undergoing HTC, 25 (17%) were HIV-infected. Having false perception of low risk (P = 0.004) and age <30 years (P = 0.02) were independently associated with HIV positivity. Only 14 of the 25 HIV-infected participants (56%) could be contacted after the result notification, of whom 12 (86%) had established HIV care and received immediate antiretroviral therapy. The active targeted HTC and facilitating care establishment was feasible among MSM attending the gay sauna but required strategies to improve accuracy of HIV-risk perception and linkage to care.",

This result suggest that, the EMMS therapy might be considered as an effective treatments in reducing pain, depression, anxiety, and stress with improvement in physical functions, quality of sleep and QOL in patient with RA. EMMS therapies were tolerated and no side effects were reported by the patient. Though the results are encouraging, further studies are required with larger sample size and advanced inflammatory markers."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We investigated the combined effects of repeated sauna therapy and exercise training on subjective symptoms, cardiac function, daily activities and ambulation capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. METHODS: Fifty four patients including 26 patients with repeated sauna therapy and exercise training (combined therapy group) and 28 patients with repeated sauna therapy (monotherapy group) participated in the study. Repeated sauna therapy and exercise training were performed once a day, 5 days a week. Clinical symptoms, brain natriuretic peptide concentration, cardiac functions evaluated by echocardiography, cardiac size on chest radiography, Barthel Index (BI) and ambulation capacity were examined and compared between the time of hospital admission and the time of discharge. RESULTS: Both the groups showed significantly improved New York Heart Association functional class, cardiothoracic ratio, brain natriuretic peptide concentration, left ventricular ejection fraction, BI score and ambulation capacity grade. The changes of New York Heart Association functional class, BI score and ambulation capacity in the combined therapy group were a higher level of statistical significance than those in monotherapy group. Notably, significant between group difference was observed in the changes of BI score. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of exercise training programs to repeated sauna therapy may be efficient and effective for improvement of cardiac function and daily activities for patients with chronic heart failure. IMPLICATIONS OF REHABILITATION: Repeated sauna therapy is an effective means of improving cardiac, vascular function and mental health in CHF patients. Exercise training is an effective means of improving exercise capacity, thus improving ADL. Combination of repeated sauna therapy and exercise training may be recommended as a comprehensive treatment to improve cardiac function, ambulation capacity, and ADL in CHF patients.",

The intensity and duration of headache pain can be very distressing and disabling on an individuals' well-being. The purpose of this study was to examine the applicability of sauna bathing as a new method of treatment for reducing pain in patients with CTTH. METHODS: Thirty-seven people who fulfilled the International Headache Society criteria for CTTH were randomly assigned into two groups. The control group (n=20) received advice and education while the intervention group (n=17) received the same advice and attended a sauna regularly for 8 weeks. Reductions in subjective pain were determined using the numerical pain rating scale (NPRS). Disturbance in sleep, depression as assessed by Beckman Disability Index (BDI), and Headache Disability Index (HDI) were measured. RESULTS: Mean change in headache intensity significantly differed between the sauna and control group by 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-2.07; F=10.17; df=1, 117; p=0.002). There was no statistically significant change in duration of headache or improvement in sleep, depression, or HDI between the sauna and control groups. CONCLUSION: Regular sauna bathing is a simple, self-directed treatment that is effective for reducing headache pain intensity in CTTH.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate effects of Finnish sauna bathing on lipid profile in healthy, young men. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen male subjects (20-23 years) were subjected to 10 sauna bathing sessions in a Finnish sauna every 1 or 2 days. The mean sauna temperature was 90±2°C, while humidity was 5-16%. Each session consisted of three 15-minute parts and a 2-minute cool-down between them. The following measurements were taken before and after the sauna sessions: body mass, heart rate, body skinfold thickness. The percentage fat content and then, the lean body mass were calculated. Total cholesterol, triacylglycerols, lipoprotein cholesterol LDL and HDL were measured in blood samples. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol was observed during 3 weeks of sauna treatment and in the week afterwards. A significant decline in triacylglycerols was found directly after the 1st and 24 h directly after the 10th sauna session. After the 10th sauna session the level of HDL cholesterol remained slightly increased, but this change was not statistically significant. A decrease in blood plasma volume was found directly after the 1st and the last sauna bathing session due to perspiration. An adaptive increase in blood plasma volume was also found after the series of 10 sauna sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Ten complete sauna bathing sessions in a Finnish sauna caused a reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol fraction levels during the sessions and a gradual return of these levels to the initial level during the 1st and the 2nd week after the experiment. A small, statistically insignificant increase in HDL-C level and a transient decline in triacylglycerols were observed after those sauna sessions. The positive effect of sauna on lipid profile is similar to the effect that can be obtained through a moderate-intensity physical exercise.",

Heat stroke may be due to either strenuous exercise or non-exercise-induced exposure to a high environmental temperature. Current management of heat stroke is mostly supportive, with an emphasis on cooling the core body temperature and preventing the development of multiple organ dysfunction. Prognosis of heat stroke depends on the severity of organ involvement. Here, we report a rare case of non-exercise-induced heat stroke in a 73-year-old male patient who was suffering from acute liver failure after prolonged exposure in a hot sauna room.

It was shown that the effect of high temperatures promotes the development of oxidative stress that is followed by the formation of adaptive reactions in the form of activation of antioxidant protection, enhancement of non-specific responses of the cells, increase of stability and restoration of structural homeostasis of erythrocyte membranes. The molecular mechanism of endothelium-independent vasodilation develops by the end of the treatment period; it may serve as the compensatory-adaptive reaction needed to maintain the adequate tone of the vascular wall and thereby to support the functioning of mechanisms supporting physical thermoregulation. The results of the study give evidence of the stimulatory influence of the described method on the adaptive and protective potential of the organism. It is concluded that the proposed scheme of physiotherapeutic treatment may be used for prophylactic purposes.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of six weeks of repeated sauna treatment on the autonomic nervous system, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and lung functions in Thai patients with allergic rhinitis. METHODS: Subjects were diagnosed with allergic rhinitis clinically by an attending physician based on history, physical examination and positive reactions to a skin prick test. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. Controlsubjects received education and maintained a normal life. The sauna group received sauna treatment over a six-week period, 3 days per week, with 6 sets of 5 minutes per set per day, totaling 30 minutes. Each 5 minute set alternated with a 5 minute period of rest. Heart rate variability (HRV), peak nasal inspiratory flow and lung function were measured at the beginning and after three and six weeks of sauna treatment. The HRV measurement is composed of three components, including low frequency (indicating sympathetic function in normal units or n.u.), high frequency (indicated parasympathetic function in n.u.), and the ratio of LF/HF (indicating the balance of the autonomic system). RESULTS: Twenty-six allergic rhinitis patients, 12 males and 14 females participated in this study, 13 in the control group and 13 in the sauna treatment group; there were 6 males in each group. Baseline characteristics for the control and sauna treatment groups were comparable. There were significant changes in the HRV after six weeks of sauna treatment. The high frequency component was significantly lower in sauna treatment group (51.8 vs 35.4), while the low frequency component and LF/HF ratio were significantly higher in sauna treatment group than in the control group (48.1 vs 64.5 and 0.9 vs 2.5, respectively). The PNIF and the forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1, were also significantly higher in sauna treatment group (103.0 vs 161.9 and 80.1 vs 95.6, respectively). CONCLUSION: The six weeks of repeated sauna treatment can increase sympathetic activity, PNIF, and FEV1 in Thai patients with allergic rhinitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Repeated low-temperature sauna (Waon) therapy relieves ischemic symptoms in patients with peripheral arterial disease. We investigated whether Waon therapy could improve myocardial perfusion in patients with ischemia related to chronic total occlusion (CTO) of coronary arteries. METHODS: Twenty-four patients who had ischemia in the CTO-related area were examined. The severity of ischemia was quantified by thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with adenosine. The Waon group (n=16) was treated daily for three weeks with a 60 °C far infrared-ray dry sauna bath for 15 min and then kept in a bed covered with blankets for 30 min. The control group (n=8) underwent myocardial perfusion scintigraphy twice with a three-week interval. RESULTS: In the control group, neither summed stress score (SSS) nor summed difference score (SDS) of myocardial scintigraphy changed. However, Waon therapy improved both SSS (16 ± 7 to 9 ± 6, p<0.01) and SDS (7 ± 4 to 3 ± 2, p<0.01), and the improvement was greater in patients with higher SSS and SDS scores at the baseline. Waon therapy extended treadmill exercise time (430 ± 185 to 511 ± 192s, p<0.01) and improved flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery (4.1 ± 1.3 to 5.9 ± 1.8%, p<0.05), but tended to decrease the number of circulating CD34-positive bone marrow-derived cells. CONCLUSIONS: Waon therapy improves CTO-related myocardial ischemia in association with improvement of vascular endothelial function. This therapy could be a complementary and alternative tool in patients with severe coronary lesions not suitable for coronary intervention.",

Most effects appear transitory, but some Utah police officers with employment-related methamphetamine exposures developed chronic symptoms, some leading to disability. This report is of an uncontrolled retrospective medical chart evaluation of symptomatic officers treated with a sauna detoxification protocol designed to reduce the chronic symptoms and improve the quality of life. METHODS: Sixty-nine officers consecutively entering the Utah Meth Cops Project were assessed before and after a treatment program involving gradual exercise, comprehensive nutritional support and physical sauna therapy. Evaluations included pre- and post-treatment scores of the Research and Development Corporation (RAND) 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) in comparison with RAND population norms, pre- and post-treatment symptom score intensities, neurotoxicity scores, Mini-Mental Status Examination, presenting symptom frequencies and a structured evaluation of treatment program safety. RESULTS: Statistically significant health improvements were seen in the SF-36 evaluations, symptom scores and neurotoxicity scores. The detoxification protocol was well tolerated, with a 92.8% completion rate. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation strongly suggests that utilizing sauna and nutritional therapy may alleviate chronic symptoms appearing after chemical exposures associated with methamphetamine-related law enforcement activities. This report also has relevance to addressing the apparent ill effects of other complex chemical exposures. In view of the positive clinical outcomes in this group, broader investigation of this sauna-based treatment regimen appears warranted.",

Studies document the effectiveness of sauna therapy for persons with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and for post-myocardial infarction care. Some individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic fatigue, chronic pain, or addictions also find benefit. Existing evidence supports the use of saunas as a component of depuration (purification or cleansing) protocols for environmentally-induced illness. While far-infrared saunas have been used in many cardiovascular studies, all studies applying sauna for depuration have utilized saunas with radiant heating units. Overall, regular sauna therapy (either radiant heat or far-infrared units) appears to be safe and offers multiple health benefits to regular users. One potential area of concern is sauna use in early pregnancy because of evidence suggesting that hyperthermia might be teratogenic.",

      "abstract": "Repeated sauna treatment, known as Waon therapy, has been shown to improve cardiac function as well as exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of this therapy regarding these improvements remain to be elucidated. Forty-one patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 68.3 ± 13.5 years old) underwent Waon therapy 5 times a week for 3 weeks. Before and after treatment, a number of assessments were performed in all subjects: 6-minute walk test, echocardiography, determination of neurohumoral factors and number of circulating CD34(+) cells, and a flow-mediated dilation (FMD) test of endothelial function. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was also performed in 20 patients. Waon therapy increased the left ventricular ejection fraction (from 30.4 ± 12.6% to 32.5% ± 12.8%, p = 0.023) and reduced plasma levels of norepinephrine (from 400 ± 258 to 300 ± 187 pg/ml, p = 0.015) and brain natriuretic peptide (from 550 ± 510 to 416 ± 431 pg/ml, p = 0.035). Waon therapy increased the 6-minute walk distance (from 337 ± 120 to 379 ± 126 m, p <0.001) in association with an improvement in FMD (from 3.5 ± 2.3% to 5.5% ± 2.7%, p <0.001) and an increase in the number of circulating CD34(+) cells (p = 0.025). Changes in 6-minute walk distance were correlated positively with those in the left ventricular ejection fraction and FMD and negatively with those in plasma levels of norepinephrine and brain natriuretic peptide levels. A multivariate analysis revealed that an increase in FMD was the only independent determinant of 6-minute walk distance improvement. Finally, Waon therapy significantly increased peak Vo(2), and this increase was also correlated with changes in FMD. In conclusion, repeated sauna therapy in patients with chronic heart failure improves exercise tolerance in association with improvement in endothelial function.",

We aimed to investigate whether thermal therapy combining sauna therapy and underwater exercise improved pain, symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in FMS patients. Forty-four female FMS patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria received 12-week thermal therapy program comprising sauna therapy once daily for 3 days/week and underwater exercise once daily for 2 days/week. Pain, symptoms, and QOL were assessed using a pain visual analog scale (VAS), a fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ), and a short form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36), respectively. All of the patients reported significant reductions in pain and symptoms of 31-77% after the 12-week thermal therapy program, which remained relatively stable (28-68%) during the 6-month follow-up period (that is, the thermal therapy program improved both the short-term and the long-term VAS and FIQ scores). Improvements were also observed in the SF-36 score. Thermal therapy combining sauna therapy and underwater exercise improved the QOL as well as the pain and symptoms of FMS patients.",

The present study investigates whether ST can increase coronary vascularity and thus attenuate cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). We induced MI by ligating the left coronary artery of Wistar rats. The rats were placed in a far-infrared dry sauna at 41°C for 15 min and then at 34°C for 20 min once daily for 4 wk. Cardiac hemodynamic, histopathological, and gene analyses were performed. Despite the similar sizes of MI between the ST and non-ST groups (51.4 ± 0.3 vs. 51.1 ± 0.2%), ST reduced left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic (9.7 ± 0.4 vs. 10.7 ± 0.5 mm, P < 0.01) and end-systolic (8.6 ± 0.5 vs. 9.6 ± 0.6 mm, P < 0.01) dimensions and attenuated MI-induced increases in LV end-diastolic pressure. Cross-sectional areas of cardiomyocytes were smaller in ST rats and associated with a significant reduction in myocardial atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels. Vascular density was reduced in the noninfarcted myocardium of non-ST rats, and the density of cells positive for CD31 and for α-smooth muscle actin was decreased. These decreases were attenuated in ST rats compared with non-ST rats and associated with increases in myocardial eNOS and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA levels. In conclusion, ST attenuates cardiac remodeling after MI, at least in part, through improving coronary vascularity in the noninfarcted myocardium. Repeated ST might serve as a novel noninvasive therapy for patients with MI.",

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomised single-blind controlled trial with a treatment duration of 3 days and a follow-up period of 4 days was conducted at a sauna in Berlin, Germany. Between November 2007 and March 2008 and between September 2008 and April 2009, 157 patients with symptoms of the common cold were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=80) and a control group (n=77). INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the intervention group inhaled hot dry air within a hot sauna, dressed in a winter coat, whereas participants in the control group inhaled dry air at room temperature within a hot sauna, also dressed in a winter coat. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the curve (AUC) summarising symptom severity over time (Days 2, 3, 5 and 7), symptom severity scores for individual days, intake of medication for the common cold and general ill feeling. RESULTS: No significant difference between groups was observed for AUC representing symptom severity over time (intervention group mean, 31.2 [SEM, 1.8]; control group mean, 35.1 [SEM, 2.3]; group difference, -3.9 [95% CI, -9.7 to 1.9]; P=0.19). However, significant differences between groups were found for medication use on Day 1 (P=0.01), symptom severity score on Day 2 (P=0.04), and participants' ratings of the effectiveness of the therapy on Day 7 (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Inhaling hot air while in a sauna has no significant impact on overall symptom severity of the common cold. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00552981.",

The present research is aimed to determine the influence of sauna baths on fat metabolism in young women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy, eumenhorreic, female volunteers (19-21 yr old) were exposed to Finnish sauna bath seven times every second day. In group I (n = 10) each time the sauna treatment lasted 30 min, whereas in group II (n = 10) 40 min with 5-minute break to cool down. Body mass, heart rate and blood pressure were measured before and after sauna bath. Rectal temperature was monitored during stay in sauna room. Prior to the sauna bath and during its last two minutes the minute oxygen uptake and the level of CO2 exhalation were analyzed in the exhaled air, and the respiratory quotient RQ was calculated. In the blood samples collected before the sauna bath and immediately afterwards hematocrit, hemoglobin, and lipid profile--total lipids, free fatty acids, total free fatty acids, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol (TC), high density lipids (HDL), low density lipids (LDL) were analyzed. RESULTS: Rectal temperature was lower in the last sauna bath than in the first one. Losses of plasma were greater during the seventh bath than during the first one. Acceleration of the metabolism of lipids occurs after every sauna bath. A reduced level of TC and LDLC and a raised level of HDL was observed after repeated sauna baths. CONCLUSION: After 2 weeks of repeated sauna session some changes in total cholesterol and concentration of LDLC were observed, while concentration of HDLC increased after 7th sauna bath in group I. Those kinds of changes may be good prognoses of ischemic heart disease prevention, but further research on the influence of sauna on fat metabolism is needed.",

      "abstract": "Sauna therapy has been used to treat a number of different diseases known or thought to have a tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. It has been interpreted to act in multiple chemical sensitivity by increasing chemical detoxification and excretion but there is no evidence that this is its main mode of action. Sauna therapy may act to increase BH4 availability via two distinct pathways. Increased blood flow in heated surface tissues leads to increased vascular shear stress, inducing increased activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH-I) in those vascular tissues which will lead to increasing BH4 synthesis. A second mechanism involves the heat shock protein Hsp90, which is induced by even modest heating of mammalian tissues. Sauna heating of these surface tissues may act via Hsp90, which interacts with the GTPCH-I complex and is reported to produce increased GTPCH-I activity by lowering its degradation. The increased consequent availability of BH4 may lead to lowered nitric oxide synthase uncoupling, such as has been reported for the eNOS enzyme. Increased BH4 synthesis in surface tissues of the body will produce increased circulating BH4 which will feed BH4 to other body tissues that may have been BH4 deficient. Similar mechanisms may act in vigorous exercise due to the increased blood shear stresses and possibly also heating of the exercising tissues and heart. There is a large and rapidly increasing number of diseases that are associated with BH4 depletion and these may be candidates for sauna therapy. Such diseases as hypertension, vascular endothelial dysfunction, multiple chemical sensitivity and heart failure are thought to be helped by sauna therapy and chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may also be helped and there are others that may be good candidates for sauna therapy.",

      "abstract": "Hot air sauna burns (HASBs) are rare but potentially fatal injuries with simultaneous rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism of HASBs involves prolonged exposure to hot air because of immobility. The burned areas are on the parts of the body that are directly exposed to hot air. This type of heat exposure results in a complex injury, in which full-thickness skin damage occurs concurrently with deeper tissue destruction. Sauna bathing is becoming more and more a popular recreational activity around the world. The objective of this review article is to familiarize burn care specialists on this unique and clinically challenging type of burn injury and to illustrate our department's long experience in treating patients with HASBs. A thorough review of the current literature with PubMed interface using the key word \"hot air sauna burn\" was performed. Six articles were found under this topic, with 42 patients being recorded. Therapy for rhabdomyolysis and aggressive early operative treatment are the cornerstones of hot air sauna burn treatment and lifesaving actions. Treatment of HASBs differs from the more common flame and scald burns. Hot air sauna burn patients require early and aggressive surgical intervention to treat the rhabdomyolysis. Amputations and excision of the affected muscles are common. Contrary to other types of burn injuries, these patients need flap coverage during the acute surgery phase. Microvascular free flaps usually perish because of damage of vascular structures deeper to the visible burned cutaneous areas. Pedicled flaps are the treatment of choice.",

Secondary measures included its impact on exercise tolerance and neuroendocrine concentrations. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, cross-over trial. SETTING: Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Six men and 3 women (age, 62-87y) with New York Heart Association Class III and IV CHF. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized into 2 groups and told to maintain their normal medication and activity regimens. One group then began a 3-times-a-week, 4-week sauna bathing program at 60+/-1 degrees C while the other continued with their usual activities and medications. Assignments were then reversed. Sessions were 15 minutes in length but were prolonged an additional 5 minutes for oral temperature increases less than 1.0 degrees C. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient acceptance, Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) scores; treadmill exercise duration and plasma adrenaline, noradrenalin, aldosterone, atrial naturectic factor, adrenomedulin, and endothelin. RESULTS: Sauna bathing was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. Improvements in MLWHFQ scores and treadmill endurance did not achieve statistical significance on a between-group basis but were more marked after the sauna than during the control phase. Neuroendocrine concentrations showed no clear effect of sauna treatment with a between-group statistically significant difference (P=.049) found only in the case of noradrenalin's 24% decrease. CONCLUSIONS: Sauna bathing under the moderate and supervised conditions of this study appears to be well tolerated and may be safe for people with CHF. More research is needed to further evaluate the safety and potential benefits of this approach.",

Seventeen RA patients and 17 AS patients were studied. IR was well tolerated, and no adverse effects were reported, no exacerbation of disease. Pain and stiffness decreased clinically, and improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 in RA and AS patients, respectively) during an IR session. Fatigue also decreased. Both RA and AS patients felt comfortable on average during and especially after treatment. In the RA and AS patients, pain, stiffness, and fatigue also showed clinical improvements during the 4-week treatment period, but these did not reach statistical significance. No relevant changes in disease activity scores were found, indicating no exacerbation of disease activity. In conclusion, infrared treatment has statistically significant short-term beneficial effects and clinically relevant period effects during treatment in RA and AS patients without enhancing disease activity. IR has good tolerability and no adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "For decades, scientists have investigated the environmental and human health effects of synthetic chemicals. A growing body of research has illuminated the spectrum of consequences deriving from our reliance these substances and their proliferation in air, water, soil and the food chain. Of particular concern is the fact that residues of many man-made chemicals are now detectible in virtually every person. A key to a chemical's tendency to persist in tissues once it has entered the body is its lipophilicity. Substances that are poorly soluble in water and quite soluble in fat have relatively free access, via lipid-rich cellular membranes, to the cells of all organs including the ability to cross the blood-brain and placental barriers. Substantial data exist demonstrating that in addition to pollutants, drugs and their metabolites dispose to tissues high in fat content, including brain and adipose. While their characteristic lipophilicity permits drugs and medications to reach target tissues, thereby producing therapeutic effects in the present, current perceptions of risk may be ignoring the possibility that adipose accumulations of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals may lead to future patterns of ill health similar to those associated with exposure to other categories of xenobiotic chemicals. Empirical data are beginning to characterize the myriad regulatory functions of adipose hormones, including roles in cravings, cognitive function, energy level, and inflammation as well as changes in adipose hormone levels associated with drug use. Included in this data are the observation that a rehabilitative treatment intervention introduced by L. Ron Hubbard in 1978 to aid in the broad elimination of chemicals from body stores improves symptoms common to both chemical exposure and drug addiction. The regimen, which includes exercise, sauna bathing, and vitamin and mineral supplementation, is utilized by nearly 70 drug rehabilitation and medical practices in over 20 countries. At present, much more is unknown than is known regarding long-term drug retention and effects. This subject deserves careful evaluation given its potential implications for health and chronic illnesses of poorly defined etiology (such as chronic fatigue syndrome), as well as drug abuse prevention, drug rehabilitation, forensic and legal areas.",

STUDY DESIGN: A literature review. METHODS: Experiments of sauna bathing were accepted if they were conducted in a heated room with sufficient heat (80 to 90 degrees C), comfortable air humidity and adequate ventilation. The sauna exposure for five to 20 minutes was usually repeated one to three times. The experiments were either acute (one day), or conducted over a longer period (several months). RESULTS: The research data retrieved were most often based on uncontrolled research designs with subjects accustomed to bathing since childhood. Sauna was well tolerated and posed no health risks to healthy people from childhood to old age. Baths did not appear to be particularly risky to patients with hypertension, coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure, when they were medicated and in a stable condition. Excepting toxemia cases, no adverse effects of bathing during pregnancy were found, and baths were not teratogenic. In musculoskeletal disorders, baths may relieve pain. Medication in general was of no concern during a bath, apart from antihypertensive medication, which may predispose to orthostatic hypotension after bathing. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed with sound experimental design, and with subjects not accustomed to sauna, before sauna bathing can routinely be used as a non-pharmacological treatment regimen in certain medical disorders to relieve symptoms and improve wellness.",

      "abstract": "In three male patients with lower respiratory disease, aged 51, 32 and 63 years, Legionnaires' disease was diagnosed by urinary antigen test and culture of the respiratory-tract fluid. In the second patient, the bronchoalveolar fluid also contained Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All three patients recovered after treatment with azithromycin in the first, cefotaxime, vancomycin and levofloxacin in the second, and erythromycin and ciprofloxacin in the third, respectively. Legionella pneumophila pneumonia is clinically not clearly distinct from other pneumonias and has a high mortality rate when not treated with the proper antibiotics. For that reason, adequate and swift diagnosis is of great importance. The urinary antigen test meets both of these criteria. Still, it is advisable to use culture and serology as well if Legionnaires' disease is suspected in a patient, since the urinary antigen test has limitations. In addition, patient isolates are ofepidemiological importance for public health. By comparing available patient isolates with Legionella strains from water sources, it is possible to identify sources of infection. In 2002, based on this principle, a project was started in The Netherlands aimed at identifying sources of infection, thereby preventing outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease by swift elimination of the source. Since the start of the project, 29 sources have been identified. In the cases described above these were a sauna, a cooling tower and a caravan, respectively. In suspected cases, respiratory-tract fluid must be collected to make possible such a source investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of repeated 60 degrees C sauna bathing in patients with chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 15 hospitalized CHF patients (New York Heart Association class = 2.8 +/- 0.4) in stable clinical condition on conventional treatments. Sauna bathing was performed once per day for 4 weeks. Repeated sauna bathing was safely completed without any adverse effects in all patients. Symptoms improved in 13 of 15 patients after 4 weeks. Sauna bathing decreased systolic blood pressure without affecting heart rate, resulting in significant decrease in the rate-pressure product (6811 +/- 1323 to 6292 +/- 1093). Echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly increased from 30 +/- 11 to 34 +/- 11%. Sauna bathing significantly improved exercise tolerance manifested by prolonged 6-minute walking distance (388 +/- 110 to 448 +/- 118 m), increased peak respiratory oxygen uptake (13.3 +/- 1.8 to 16.3 +/- 2.1 mL/kg/min), and enhanced anaerobic threshold (9.4 +/- 1.2 to 11.5 +/- 1.9 mL/kg/min). Four-week bathing significantly reduced plasma epinephrine (40 +/- 42 to 21 +/- 23 pg/mL) and norepinephrine (633 +/- 285 to 443 +/- 292 pg/mL). Sauna bathing reduced the number of hospital admission for CHF (2.5 +/- 1.3 to 0.6 +/- 0.8 per year). CONCLUSION: Repeated 60 degrees C sauna bathing was safe and improved symptoms and exercise tolerance in chronic CHF patients. Sauna bathing may be an effective adjunctive therapy for chronic systolic CHF.",

It has been reported that sauna therapy, which allows thermal vasodilation, improves vascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with CHF. The present study investigates the mechanisms through which sauna therapy improves endothelial dysfunction induced by CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Normal control and male TO-2 cardiomyopathic hamsters were used. Thirty-week-old TO-2 hamsters were treated daily with an experimental far infrared-ray dry sauna system for 15 min at 39 degrees C followed by 20 min at 30 degrees C. This procedure raised the rectal temperatures by about 1 degrees C. Arterial endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) mRNA and protein expressions were examined, and serum concentrations of nitrate were measured. The expression of eNOS mRNA in the aortas of normal controls did not change, whereas those of the TO-2 hamsters decreased with age. Four weeks of sauna therapy significantly increased eNOS mRNA expression in the aortas of TO-2 hamsters compared with those that did not undergo sauna therapy. Sauna therapy also upregulated aortic eNOS protein expression. Serum nitrate concentrations of the TO-2 hamsters were increased by 4 weeks of sauna therapy compared with those that did not undergo sauna. CONCLUSION: Repeated sauna therapy increases eNOS expression and NO production in cardiomyopathic hamsters with heart failure.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty patients (59+/-3 years) with New York Heart Association functional class II or III CHF and at least 200 premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)/24 h assessed by 24-h Holter recordings were studied. They were randomized into sauna-treated (n=20) or non-treated (n=10) groups. The sauna-treated group underwent a 2-week program of a daily 60 degrees C far infrared-ray dry sauna for 15 min, followed by 30 min bed rest with blankets, for 5 days per week. Patients in the non-treated group had bed rest in a temperature-controlled room (24 degrees C) for 45 min. The total numbers of PVCs/24 h in the sauna-treated group decreased compared with the non-treated group [848+/-415 vs 3,097+/-1,033/24 h, p<0.01]. Heart rate variability (SDNN, standard deviation of normal-to-normal beat interval) increased [142+/-10 (n=16) vs 112+/-11 ms (n=8), p<0.05] and plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentrations decreased [229+/-54 vs 419+/-110 pg/ml, p<0.05] in the sauna-treated group compared with the non-treated group.

Because AN entails a relentless pursuit of thinness, it might be expected that these patients would frequently resort to saunas. The paper sustains that the absence of reports should not be taken to mean that sauna use is irrelevant to AN. Support for this possibility is founded in the apparent progress shown by AN patients whose treatment consisted of different strategies of heat supply, which included a protocol of sauna sessions. First recommended by W. Gull, heat-treatment may be relevant to hyperactivity, a significant clinical characteristic in AN. This treatment was developed as an extrapolation from animal research model, where a simple manipulation of ambient temperature (AT) was found to impede and reverse excessive running in food-restricted rats. Sauna use may have been unreported either because it impedes the development of the syndrome, or its benefits have been attributed to conventional treatments. The elucidation of sauna experience among AN patients may have potential implications for the role of heat in the treatment of AN."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism by which 60 degrees C sauna treatment improves cardiac function in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that repeated 60 degrees C sauna treatment improves hemodynamic data and clinical symptoms in patients with CHF. We hypothesized that the sauna restores endothelial function and then improves cardiac function. METHODS: Twenty patients (62 plus minus 15 years) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III CHF were treated in a dry sauna at 60 degrees C for 15 min and then kept on bed rest with a blanket for 30 min, daily for two weeks. Ten patients with CHF, matched for age, gender and NYHA functional class, were placed on a bed in a temperature-controlled (24 degrees C) room for 45 min as the nontreated group. Using high-resolution ultrasound, we measured the diameter of the brachial artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia (percent flow-mediated dilation, %FMD: endothelium-dependent dilation), as well as after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (%NTG: endothelium-independent dilation). Cardiac function was evaluated by measuring the concentrations of plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). RESULTS: Clinical symptoms were improved in 17 of 20 patients after two weeks of sauna therapy. The %FMD after two-week sauna treatment significantly increased from the baseline value, whereas the %NTG-induced dilation did not. Concentrations of BNP after the two-week sauna treatment decreased significantly. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the change in %FMD and the percent improvement in BNP concentrations in the sauna-treated group. In contrast, none of the variables changed at the two-week interval in the nontreated group. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated sauna treatment improves vascular endothelial function, resulting in an improvement in cardiac function and clinical symptoms.",

This 7-year retrospective analyses of 598 burn patients treated in Kuopio University Hospital Burn Unit revealed that every fourth burn in our unit was sauna-related, giving a total of 154 cases. Most of these burns were minor but 54% required operative treatment. A total of 71% of patients were male and 40% of all patients were under the influence of alcohol. The incidence of sauna-related burns in Finland according to our material is 7/100,000, giving a total of 357 patients annually. Hence, there is one sauna-related burn per day requiring hospitalization in Finland.",

The results were interpreted in conjunction with clinical and epidemiologic data. The DNA prove was derived from the insertion sequence IS 6110. A 63-year-old man who stayed at a day-laborers' facility for eight months was found to have advanced cavitary lung disease with sputum smears strongly positive for acid-fast bacilli. One year later a 46-year-old man staying at the same facility for 24 months was also found to have sputum-positive tuberculosis. The 46-year-old man had undergone treatment for tuberculosis 16 years previously and showed radiographic evidence of previous lung damage from tuberculosis. The second man had no tubercule bacilli in sputum when the 63-year-old man was found to have sputum-positive tuberculosis. The organisms isolated from these two men were both drug sensitive and had a similar RFLP pattern which suggests that 63-year-old man was the source of this outbreak and that pulmonary tuberculosis in the 46-year-old man was caused by exogenous reinfection. We conclude that exogenous reinfection may have been one pattern of tuberculosis transmission in this high-risk environment.",

Second, to raise awareness in the practice of medicine of the importance of taking an environmentally oriented history. SUBJECT: A patient with a chronic, debilitating multisystem disorder of 20-years' duration related to a chemical sensitivity resulting from low-level exposure to toxic chemicals (solvents) at work. INTERVENTIONS: Detoxification treatment consisted of heat chamber depuration (sauna) together with a specific protocol of oral and intravenous therapy. Appropriate advice was offered related to choosing a safe and suitable workplace. OUTCOME MEASURES: Observation of the dynamic interaction and elimination of chlorinated and aromatic hydrocarbons (solvents) from the patient's bloodstream and related clinical improvement during the course of treatment. RESULTS: The patient was able to discontinue, without ill effect, all medications previously prescribed to treat her symptoms. Heat chamber depuration (sauna) detoxification treatment brought substantial release of symptoms and returned the individual to gainful employment. CONCLUSION: The connection between symptoms of chronic degenerative diseases and environmental and/or nutritional factors is missed in many cases due to lack of obtaining an environmentally oriented medical history. Taking such a history and dealing with the cause of illness using avoidance and/or appropriate therapy is preventive and cost-effective for both the patient and society.",

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and during dynamic exercise were decreased significantly (p < or = 0.01) by sauna therapy. Change of blood pressure at isometric exercise was not significant (from 157.5 +/- 16.5 mmHg to 155.0 +/- 15.4 mmHg). The changes of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were also not significant. Half-time of muscle clearance decreased significantly (from 4.4 +/- 1.9 min to 3.2 +/- 1.2 min, p < or = 0.01) and functional cross-section A increased significantly (from 3.8 +/- 0.9 mm2.c to 4.4 +/- 0.9 mm2.c, p < or = 0.01) after the sauna therapy at dynamic exercise, but not at isometric exercise. These results show the changes between isometric and dynamic exercise, which can only be explained well by a study of peripheral hemodynamic.

Regular visits to a sauna may promote three adaptive effects: a simulation of the training generally associated with sports activities, the building up of resistance to the effects of extreme exposures, and the regulation of autonomic functions. However, the effect that the sauna has on the physiological mechanisms of humans--particularly, the effect of contrast-cooling following thermal exposure--is still obscure. An example of contrast-cooling following thermal exposure is that caused by swimming after using a sauna; such contrast-cooling may be a risk factor for people with unstable blood pressure, and gradual cooling-off after using a sauna may be preferable. In this series, various autonomic functions under different heating and cooling treatment in a sauna were studied. The authors have concluded that the mode of exposures to heating and cooling under control of Heart Rate (HR) changes has, to a certain extent, a relaxing effect, and thus can be recommended for alleviating psycho-emotional stress.",

      "abstract": "Rehabilitation results are reported concerning the behavior of blood pressure and heart rate, peripheral and central hemodynamics, after resting and during exercise and physical conditioning by running as training and sauna, respectively, in hypertensive patients with IHD after aortocoronary venous bypass (ACVB) surgery. Bicycle ergometric examinations an xenon wash-out (for the determination of the mean functional vessel cross section A) were performed in 43 male untrained patients before and after physical therapy. The left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) at rest was also determined in these patients. Significant increases in the ejection fraction at rest (on average by 7-8%) could be demonstrated in both therapy groups. The group average value for peripheral microcirculation improved only in the sauna group. Blood pressure after resting and on exercise was not influenced. Results are discussed on the basis of the literature and practical conclusions drawn.",
