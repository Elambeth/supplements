      "abstract": "Overactivation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) pathway leads to vasoconstriction and elevated blood pressure. Persicaria minor (Huds.) Opiz is an herbal plant known for its antioxidant, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-atherosclerotic properties, with bioactive compounds that exhibit antihypertensive effects. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the antihypertensive effects of the standardized aqueous extract of P. minor leaf (AEPM) through the ACE/AT1R pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). HUVECs were stimulated with PMA to induce ACE, with or without AEPM or captopril treatment, for 24 h. Subsequently, ACE mRNA expression, ACE protein levels, ACE activity, angiotensin II levels, and AT1R expression were measured. The results demonstrated that AEPM treatment significantly reduced ACE mRNA expression, ACE protein levels, ACE activity, angiotensin II levels, and AT1R expression in PMA-induced HUVECs. The modulatory effects of AEPM on the ACE/AT1R pathway were comparable to those of captopril. Ex vivo experiments further confirmed that AEPM reduced the contraction responses of rat aortic rings to PMA. In conclusion, P. minor effectively inhibits the ACE/AT1R pathway in PMA-induced HUVECs, suggesting its potential as a natural antihypertensive agent."

      "abstract": "Persicaria minor (P. minor) is a herbal plant with many uses in food, perfume, and the medical industry. P. minor extract contains flavonoids with antioxidant and anticholinesterase capacity, which could enhance cognitive functions. P. minor extract has been proven to enhance memory. However, its role in an animal model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), which resembles human vascular dementia, has yet to be explored. Therefore, the present study investigates the effects of chronic (14 days) administration of aqueous P. minor extract on different stages of learning and memory processes and the metabolic pathways involved in the chronic cerebral hypoperfused rats induced by the permanent bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries (PBOCCA) surgery. Chronic treatment of P. minor extract at doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg, enhanced recognition memory of the PBOCCA rats. P. minor extract (200 mg/kg) was also found to restore the spatial memory impairment induced by CCH. A high dose (300 mg/kg) of the P. minor extract significantly increased the expression of both ACh and GABA neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. Further, distinctive metabolite profiles were observed in rats with different treatments. Three major pathways involved in the cognitive enhancement mechanism of P. minor were identified. The present findings demonstrated an improving effect of P. minor extract on memory in the CCH rat model, suggesting that P. minor extract could be a potential treatment for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's patients. P. minor is believed to improve cognitive deficits by regulating pathways involved in retinol, histidine, pentose, glucuronate, and CoA metabolism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persicaria minor extract exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and has potential effects on cognitive function and mood. However, the effects of P.minor on brain activation and biomarkers have not been studied among older adults. This multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study aimed to investigate the effect of 6 months P.minor extract supplement (Biokesum®) on cognition, mood, biomarkers, and brain activation among older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). METHOD: A total of 36 Malaysian community-dwelling older adults with MCI (60-75-year-old) were randomized into Biokesum® (n = 18) and placebo group (n = 18). Each subject consumed one capsule of Biokesum® (250 mg/capsule) or placebo (maltodextrin, 280 mg/capsule) twice daily for 6 months. Cognitive function and mood were assessed at baseline, 3rd, and 6th-month using neuropsychological tests (MMSE, Digit Span, RAVLT, Digit Symbol, and Visual Reproduction) and Profile of Mood State (POMS) questionnaire. Blood lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and biomarkers (MDA, LPO, COX-2, iNOS, and BDNF) were measured at baseline and 6th month. By the end of the intervention, there were 30 compliers (Biokesum®: N = 15; Placebo: N = 15) and 6 dropouts. For brain activation assessment, 15 subsamples (Biokesum®: N = 8; Placebo: N = 7) completed N-back and Stroop tasks during fMRI scanning at baseline and 6th month. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9 and 46) was identified as a region of interest (ROI) for brain activation analysis using SPM software. RESULTS: Two-way mixed ANOVA analysis showed significant improvements in Visual Reproduction II (p = 0.012, partial η2 = 0.470), tension (p = 0.042, partial η2 = 0.147), anger (p = 0.010, partial η2 = 0.207), confusion (p = 0.041, partial η2 = 0.148), total negative subscales (p = 0.043, partial η2 = 0.145), BDNF (p = 0.020, partial η2 = 0.179) and triglyceride (p = 0.029, partial η2 = 0.237) following 6 months of Biokesum® supplementation. Preliminary finding also demonstrated significant improvement at 0-back task-induced right DLPFC activation (p = 0.028, partial η2 = 0.652) among subsamples in Biokesum® group. No adverse events were reported at the end of the study. CONCLUSION: Six months Biokesum® supplementation potentially improved visual memory, negative mood, BDNF, and triglyceride levels among older adults with MCI. Significant findings on brain activation at the right DPLFC must be considered as preliminary. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered on 30th August 2019 [ ISRC TN12417552 ].",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persicaria minor (kesum) is an herbaceous plant with a high level of secondary metabolite compounds, particularly terpenoids. These terpenoid compounds have well-established roles in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Although the terpenoids of P. minor have been studied thoroughly, the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in terpenoid regulation remains poorly understood and needs to be explored. In this study, P. minor plants were inoculated with the pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum for terpenoid induction. RESULT: SPME GC-MS analysis showed the highest terpenoid accumulation on the 6th day post-inoculation (dpi) compared to the other treatment time points (0 dpi, 3 dpi, and 9 dpi). Among the increased terpenoid compounds, α-cedrene, valencene and β-bisabolene were prominent. P. minor inoculated for 6 days was selected for miRNA library construction using next generation sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis showed that 58 miRNAs belonging to 30 families had significantly altered regulation. Among these 58 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 27 [corrected] miRNAs were upregulated, whereas 31 [corrected] miRNAs were downregulated. Two putative novel pre-miRNAs were identified and validated through reverse transcriptase PCR. Prediction of target transcripts potentially involved in the mevalonate pathway (MVA) was carried out by psRobot software, resulting in four miRNAs: pmi-miR530, pmi-miR6173, pmi-miR6300 and a novel miRNA, pmi-Nov_13. In addition, two miRNAs, miR396a and miR398f/g, were predicted to have their target transcripts in the non-mevalonate pathway (MEP). In addition, a novel miRNA, pmi-Nov_12, was identified to have a target gene involved in green leaf volatile (GLV) biosynthesis. RT-qPCR analysis showed that pmi-miR6173, pmi-miR6300 and pmi-nov_13 were downregulated, while miR396a and miR398f/g were upregulated. Pmi-miR530 showed upregulation at 9 dpi, and dynamic expression was observed for pmi-nov_12. Pmi-6300 and pmi-miR396a cleavage sites were detected through degradome sequence analysis. Furthermore, the relationship between miRNA metabolites and mRNA metabolites was validated using correlation analysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that six studied miRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate terpenoid biosynthesis in P. minor. This regulatory behaviour of miRNAs has potential as a genetic tool to regulate terpenoid biosynthesis in P. minor.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Jasmonic acid (JA) and its derivative, methyl JA (MeJA) are hormonal cues released by plants that signal defense response to curb damages from biotic and abiotic stresses. To study such response, a tropical herbal plant, Persicaria minor, which possesses pungent smell and various bioactivities including antimicrobial and anticancer, was treated with MeJA. Such elicitation has been performed in hairy root cultures and plants such as Arabidopsis and rice, yet how MeJA influenced the proteome of an herbal species like P. minor is unknown. METHOD: In this study, P. minor plants were exogenously elicited with MeJA and leaf samples were subjected to SWATH-MS proteomics analysis. A previously published translated transcriptome database was used as a reference proteome database for a comprehensive protein sequence catalogue and to compare their differential expression. RESULTS: From this proteomics informed by transcriptomics approach, we have successfully profiled 751 proteins of which 40 proteins were significantly different between control and MeJA-treated samples. Furthermore, a correlation analysis between both proteome and the transcriptome data sets suggests that significantly upregulated proteins were positively correlated with their cognate transcripts (Pearson's r = 0.677) while a weak correlation was observed for downregulated proteins (r = 0.147). DISCUSSION: MeJA treatment induced the upregulation of proteins involved in various biochemical pathways including stress response mechanism, lipid metabolism, secondary metabolite production, DNA degradation and cell wall degradation. Conversely, proteins involved in energy expensive reactions such as photosynthesis, protein synthesis and structure were significantly downregulated upon MeJA elicitation. Overall protein-transcript correlation was also weak (r = 0.341) suggesting the existence of post-transcriptional regulation during such stress. In conclusion, proteomics analysis using SWATH-MS analysis supplemented by the transcriptome database allows comprehensive protein profiling of this non-model herbal species upon MeJA treatment."
