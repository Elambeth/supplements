      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Garcinia cambogia (hydroxy citric acid) alone or in combination with Silodosin on the clinical outcomes of lower urinary tract symptoms/Benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study conducted on patients with LUTS/BPH. Eligible patients were assigned randomly to one of three groups. Group A (33 patients) received Silodosin, 8 mg, once daily. Group B (35 patients) received Garcinia extract 500 mg TID. Group C (36 patients) received the combination of Silodosin, plus Garcinia extract. All participants were assessed for the changes in; the maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Post-Void Residual (PVR), prostate volume (PV), and serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, at the baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The baseline data regarding Qmax, IPSS, PVR, PV, and PSA showed non-significant differences between the three groups. After 12 weeks of treatment, all groups showed a significant improvement in both Qmax and IPSS (P >.001) and group C showed the best improvement. The PVR was significantly reduced in all groups (P >.001). The PV was significantly increased in group A (P = .006), whereas it was significantly reduced in groups B and C (P >.001). The PSA showed a non-significant increase in group A (P = .625), while it was significantly decreased in groups B and C (P >.001). CONCLUSION: Treatment with Garcinia extract, especially in combination with Silodosin, may improve the Qmax, IPSS, PVR, PV, and PSA in patients with LUTS/BPH without any clinical significant adverse effects."

This study evaluates the antibacterial efficacy of green-synthesized zinc oxide NPs (ZnO-NPs) derived from Garcinia mangostana leaf extract against both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria relevant to poultry health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a completely randomized design, six treatment groups were tested: Positive control (PC) (tetracycline, 2.5 mg/mL), negative control (NC) (HCl 0.1 N + distilled water), and ZnO-NPs at concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/mL. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using the agar well diffusion method, measuring inhibition zones against Escherichia coli, S. Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus plantarum. RESULTS: The positive control demonstrated the most significant inhibition zones across all bacterial strains. ZnO-NPs exhibited dose-dependent antibacterial activity, with maximum inhibition zones recorded as 18.58 mm for E. coli, 17.09 mm for S. Typhimurium, and 17.41 mm for S. aureus at the highest concentration (10 mg/mL). However, the antibacterial activity against L. plantarum was less pronounced, with a maximum inhibition zone of 9.93 mm. These findings indicate selective toxicity of ZnO-NPs, favoring pathogenic over non-pathogenic strains. CONCLUSION: Green-synthesized ZnO-NPs using G. mangostana leaf extract demonstrate promising antibacterial properties against poultry pathogens. Their selective action highlights potential applications as eco-friendly feed additives to improve poultry health and mitigate pathogenic risks."

      "abstract": "Previous studies have assessed how supplementing with Garcinia cambogia affects glycaemic control and liver enzyme levels; nevertheless, the results were not consistent. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of Garcinia cambogia on glycaemic control and liver enzymes through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Searches were conducted from the beginning through February 2023, using online databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library). Trials examining the impact of Garcinia cambogia on serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), serum level of insulin, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) in adults were included. The overall estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. This meta-analysis includes nine publications with 444 participants. The results showed that Garcinia cambogia has no significant effect on FBS (weighted mean difference (WMD): 1.02 mg/dl, 95% CI: -1.29, 3.33), insulin (WMD: -0.12 mU/L, 95% CI: -1.50, 1.25), AST (Hedges' g: -0.08, 95% CI: -0.43, 0.26), and ALT (Hedges' g: 0.27, 95% CI: -0.20, 0.73). Subgroup analysis showed that Garcinia cambogia significantly increased insulin levels in females and also increased insulin and FBS levels in those with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Nevertheless, the administration of Garcinia cambogia for more than 8 weeks significantly decreased insulin levels. This meta-analysis showed that supplementation with Garcinia cambogia has no significant effect on FBS, insulin, ALT, or AST levels compared with control groups; however, it seems that increasing the duration of the intervention may have a decreasing effect on insulin levels.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a fast-emerging global burden, is an umbrella term for several liver manifestations that result in excessive accumulation of fat in the liver. NAFLD leads to gut microbiome dysbiosis, loss in gut epithelia, increased gut permeability, etc. The limited availability of registered drugs for NAFLD highlights the urgent need to focus on understanding its pathogenesis and discovering new treatments, including the potential exploration of herbal therapies for managing the condition. In this study, we evaluated the bioactive potential of garcinol enriched fraction from Garcinia morella fruit rind in preventing NAFLD-associated increased gut permeability. Administration of garcinol-enriched fraction (GEF) significantly reduced body weight, serum lipids (triglyceride and total cholesterol) levels, and enzymes (alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase) responsible for liver dysfunction in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice. GEF treatment also regulated the alteration in signaling pathways of lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice by inhibiting the overexpression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. Mice treated with GEF had increased gut microbial diversity, reduced pathogenic bacteria, and increased Lactococcus and Streptococcaceae genera. Additionally, GEF treatment could increase the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins, which were otherwise decreased in HFD-fed mice, stipulating its protective effect in maintaining gut barrier integrity. Our study demonstrated that GEF treatment reduces obesity in mice and improves gut health by keeping junctions tight and maintaining a healthy gut microbiome.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Estrogen hormone dependence accounts for a major cause in the incidence of women breast cancer. ER-α is the major ER subtype in the mammary epithelium and plays a critical role in breast cancer progression. Tamoxifen (1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)-phenyl]-1,2- diphenylbut-1(Z)-ene) is a nonsteroidal antiestrogen prodrug which formed pharmacologically active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, largely used for endocrine therapy in pre and postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. However, long term treatment with tamoxifen results in acquires resistance and high probability of disease recurring, hence the need for an alternative breast cancer drug. In silico approach was used to investigate the inhibitory activities of a novel dimeric flavanonol OC251FR2 (3,3'-oxybis(5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one)-3,3'-oxybis(5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one) isolated from the chloroform fraction of Garcinia kola, against alpha Estrogen receptor (ER-α); a major contributor to the growth of breast cancer. The docking was conducted using Maestro module 13.5 to obtained the ER-α PDB (5W9C) from NCBI. The OC251FR2 was docked using ligprep module with 4-hydroxytamoxifen being the reference drug. The qikpro was used to investigate the drug-likeliness while ligand docking and induced fit docking were used to investigate the interaction and binding affinity of the ligands with the active sites of the PDB. The result shows that the isolated OC251FR2 with docking score value of -6.214 interact more with amino acids in the active sites via H-bond, pi-pi interaction than the reference drug 4-Hydroxytamoxifen with a docking score value of -5.289. The drug-likeliness determined by qikpro shows that OC251FR2 violated three of the Lipinski rules of 5, and also have percent oral absorption. The quantum mechanics values show that OC251FR2 have similar properties comparable to the reference drug 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Hence, can serve as potential lead against alpha Estrogen receptor (ER-α).

      "abstract": "Herbal medicine could be an option for atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment for those suffering from global public health. HMB is a new combination of three herb extracts, consisting of the Ha-Rak (HR) remedy extract, Piper betle (PB) extract, and Garcinia mangostana (GM) extract in equal proportions, using Thai traditional medicine theory, that uses a combination of medications that can improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects and toxicity. HMB extract has anti-inflammatory and antiallergic properties, is a component for AD treatment, and tends to develop topical products. Drug registration requires stability data. Results from drug stability testing affect not only the efficacy of the drug but also its safety. The aim of this study was to investigate stability through forced degradation and an accelerated study of extracts. Chemical content analysis and in vitro biological activities such as anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activities determined the effects of all examined samples. Anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects were assessed by inhibiting nitric oxide synthesis in RAW 264.7 cells and β-hexosaminidase release in RBL-2H3 cells, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assessed content indicators. Moisture and temperature hydrolysis had no significant differences in the chemical or biological properties of the HMB. However, the HMB demonstrated sensitivity to alkaline hydrolysis, showed low anti-inflammatory activity, and decreased hydroxychavicol, eugenol, and α-mangostin contents. The contents of the three compounds also decrease with acid hydrolysis. For the accelerated study, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects and hydroxychavicol amount were not significantly different after 180 days at 40°C and 75% RH. Therefore, the contents of eugenol and α-mangostin were changed. Eugenol in HMB decreased significantly from the 15th day until the 180th day of storage. In addition, α-mangostin amounts in HMB decreased slightly on 180th day. Fortunately, reducing the two chemicals did not affect anti-inflammatory or antiallergic effects. For stability, combination extract should be stored in a closed container in the refrigerator at a low temperature and protected from light, high temperature, oxygen, and pH. Further HMB development should avoid pH or oxidation processes or components."

      "abstract": "Garcinia smeathmannii is a well-known plant for its uses in the effective treatment of intestinal parasites, skin eruptions and skin burns. The dichloromethane-methanol (2:3) crude extract of the leaves of G. smeathmannii led to the isolation and characterization of twenty compounds (1-20) using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. Extracts and compounds were screened in vitro for their anti-inflammatory (ROS), antiglycation and antileishmanial (L. tropica) activities. Compounds were also screened for their in silico anti-inflammatory activities using Maestro 4.2.1 software with the co-crystal complex structures of the ovine oCOX-1: meloxicam (PDB Id: 4O1Z) and murine mCOX-2: meloxicam (PDB Id: 4M11) proteins. An unprecedented flavonol (1) and a flavone dimer (2) together with eighteen known compounds (3-20) were characterized. All the tested samples in vitro revealed no antiglycation and antileishmanial activities. Beside, extracts revealed moderate anti-inflammatory activities (IC50 ranging from 24.1 ± 2.0 to 34.7 ± 0.8 μg/mL). Only compound (13) revealed an anti-inflammatory activity which was 9.33 times more active than the reference (Ibuprofen, IC50 = 11.2 ± 1.9 μg/mL) with IC50 of 1.2 ± 0.0 μg/mL. Compounds (2-9, 11-13 and 19-20) were docked and the docking scores were ranging from -10.178 to -6.119 (kcal/mol) which were in agreement with the experimental anti-inflammatory activity. These results are in agreement with the traditional uses of the leave of G. smeathmannii as cataplasm for skin eruption and as analgesic agent.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a significant global health issue, and alternative treatments from natural products like Garcinia mangostana L. [Clusiaceae] or GM are being explored for their potential benefits. This study focused on evaluating the hypoglycemic effects of GM on diabetic rodent models. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase for studies reporting blood glucose levels within 2 weeks as the primary outcome and changes in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as secondary outcomes. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to determine the pooled effectiveness of each intervention, estimating the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from both direct and indirect evidence. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SURCA) was used to rank the interventions. RESULTS: Ten articles were identified, with nine included for quantitative analysis. All GM extracts showed greater effectiveness than the control in decreasing blood glucose levels within 2 weeks. GM at 200 mg/kg (GM200) was the top-ranked extract for reducing glucose levels beyond 2 weeks and increasing HDL-C levels. The ethanol extract of GM at 200 mg/kg (GME200) was the most effective for blood glucose reduction within 2 weeks and for TC and TG reductions. The methanol extract of GM at 200 mg/kg (GMM200) was the top-ranked extract for LDL-C reductions. CONCLUSION: GM and its extracts demonstrated significant hypoglycemic activity and improvements in lipid profiles in diabetic rodent models, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus. Further research in human trials is warranted to confirm these findings and establish clinical applications.

      "abstract": "Obesity is considered one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The browning process has been recently recognized as a promising anti-obesity therapy. Lycopene (LYC) and Garcinia cambogia fruit extract (GE) might be important resources for anti-obesity drugs; therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-obesity effects of LYC and GE on 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Zucker rats. Mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were differentiated in mature adipocytes and then treated with LYC (0.5 μM), GE (30 mg/mL) or LYC + GE for 24 h. Moreover, male Zucker Crl:ZUC-Leprfa rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups of 10 animals to orally receive Vehicle (Ctrl), Orlistat (20 mg/kg), LYC (5 mg/kg), GE (1000 mg/kg) or LYC + GE for 28 days. LYC, GC extracts and even more LYC + GE stimulated the mRNA and protein expression of thermogenic genes UCP1, CIDEA and DIO2, significantly reduced lipid droplet size and increased lipid droplet number in adipocytes. UCP1 mRNA and protein expression was also increased in the visceral adipose tissue of the rats that received the dietary intake of LYC, GE and even more LYC + GE. Moreover, LYC + GE induced the reorganization of visceral fat depots that showed a great number of small adipocytes and a significant reduction in weight gain and food intake compared to the control group. The obtained results demonstrated that LYC + GE might be used as new approaches for obesity management in order to induce the browning process and achieve a metabolically active tissue instead of a tissue characterized by lipid depot accumulation."

Their structures were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, ECD calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compounds 6-9 possess a rare bicyclo[4.3.1]decane skeleton. Additionally, the anti-tumor activity of the 12 isolates was evaluated. The results indicated that compounds 5, 9, and 12 exhibited significant cytotoxicity in a wide range of cancer cell lines, including the human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, human lung cancer A549 cells, human colon cancer SW480 cells and human ovarian cancer HEY cells. Further studies indicated that compound 5 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, to inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, these findings expand the chemical diversity of PPAPs and further demonstrate the potential of PPAPs as candidates for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pastoralists in Nigeria mix Garcinia kola seed (GK), Khaya senegalensis stem bark (KS), and Vernonia amygdalina leaves (VA) to treat leptospirosis. AIM: To determine the in vitro and in vivo effect on single and combination therapy on Leptospira interrogans-infected mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation of in vitro assay for anti-leptospiral motility of the extracts was carried out in triplicates. For the in vivo assessment, 40 adult male mice inoculated with Leptospira were randomly allocated into 8 groups of 5 mice each. Groups IV-IX were treated with 800 mg/kg b.w. of KS, GK, VA, KS + GK, KS + VA, GK + VA for 5 days. Group I was negative control, II was model control, and III was treated with penicillin (3.7 mg/kg b.w.) intramuscularly. RESULTS: In vitro, at 90 min, all the extracts at 800, 400, and 200 mg/ml showed complete cessation of motility which was significantly (p < 0.05) different when compared to the negative control. A significant (p < 0.05) IC50 of 0.18 mg/ml was recorded with GK when compared to KS (0.40 mg/ml), VA (0.25 mg/ml), and procaine penicillin (0.31 mg/ml). Mean packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in all infected groups and returned to almost pre-infection values. However, significant leucocytosis (p < 0.05) was observed in group II. AST and ALP showed a significant increase (p < 0.001). Histopathological evaluation showed the extracts to prevent the distortion of normal architecture of the selected organs. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant potential of Garcinia kola, Khaya senegalensis, and Vernonia amygdalina extracts singly and in combination to combat leptospirosis.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nowadays people are exposed to radiation due to various reasons, including natural, diagnostic, occupational or accidental exposure. High level of exposure to ionizing radiation can be fatal to human body. Synthetic drugs used to prevent radiation-induced damage are toxic in nature. Recently, Herbal drugs are being screened as an alternative due to their mechanism of action. Garcinia indica (G. indica) is one of the traditional medicinal plant which contains phytochemicals having several medicinal properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, G. indica extract was observed for its modulatory effect against 3 Gray (Gy) gamma radiation-induced damages in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Various concentrations of G. indica extract ranging from 1 to 25 µg/mL was added to the blood post irradiation at 0 hr. Chromosomal aberration (CA) and Cytochalasin B blocked Micronuclei Cytome (CBMN) Assay were performed as per standard procedure. RESULTS: Radiomodulatory effect of Garcinia indica fruit rind extract (GIFRE) on CA and MN formation was observed in this study. Treatment of GIFRE did not affect the mitotic index. Positive inhibition percentages for dicentrics, total chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei were observed except for one instance. CONCLUSION: Owing to the various properties of Garcinia extracts, it makes it a potential candidate to be tested for its radiomodulatory effect. Based on the results observed in this preliminary study, it could act as a radiomodulatory agent. Radiomodulatory effect of GIFRE could possibly serve it as a potential herbal medicinal alternative to current drugs. However, results of this study need to be validated on larger sample size.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumption and abuse of alcohol remains a significant cause of concern worldwide. Furthermore, there is evidence of the association between chronic alcohol use and reduced life expectancy. OBJECTIVES: To study the effects of Garcinia binucao extract (GBE) supplementation on lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster, in the presence or absence of chronic alcohol exposure. METHODS: D. melanogaster was mass cultured and given GBE supplementation in high (1 mg/mL) and low (200 µg/mL) sublethal doses. D. melanogaster flies were divided into groups - with and without chronic alcohol exposure, and their respective lifespans were monitored. RESULTS: In D. melanogaster without alcohol exposure, mean lifespan was highest in the control flies (38.15 days), followed by high-dose GBE (34.42 days), low-dose GBE (33.24 days), and DMSO (22.29 days). In D. melanogaster chronically exposed to alcohol, the longest mean lifespan was observed in flies treated with high-dose GBE (33.80 days), followed by low-dose GBE (33.63 days), the DMSO group (30.30), and the control group (29.65 days), but the differences were not statistically significant. Comparing groups with and without chronic alcohol exposure, the mean lifespan of the control group chronically exposed to alcohol significantly decreased by 9.51 days (p < 0.05). In GBE treatment groups, mean lifespan significantly decreased by 0.82 days in high-dose set-up (p < 0.05), and significantly increased by 0.39 days in the low-dose set-up (p < 0.05) upon chronic alcohol exposure. CONCLUSION: Garcinia binucao extract supplementation ameliorated the observed reduction in lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster chronically exposed to alcohol."

      "abstract": "Owing to the persistent number of parasitic deaths, Visceral leishmaniasis continues to haunt several economically weaker sections of India. The disease causes over 30,000 deaths and threatens millions annually on a global scale. The standard pentavalent antimonials, on the other hand, are associated with health adversities and disease relapse. The current study is focused on the search for the most potential natural bioactive phytocompound from the bark extract of the Northeastern Indian plant, Garcinia cowa, that shows potent anti-leishmanial properties. The High Resonance Liquid Chromatography followed by Mass Spectrometry (HR-LCMS) study followed by an in silico molecular docking using computational tools revealed that α-mangostin might potentially possess antiparasitic activity. To validate the anti-leishmanial efficacy of the compound, a cell viability assay was performed, which demonstrated the parasite-specific inhibitory activity of α-mangostin; with IC50 values ranging from 4.95 - 7.37 µM against the different forms of Leishmania donovani parasite. The flow cytometric analysis of the phytocompound treated parasites indicated an oxidative and nitrosative stress-mediated apoptotic cell death in the parasites, by the suggestive surge in nuclear fragmentation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Simultaneously, a cytokine profiling study suggested approximate two-to-three-fold upregulated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines post-compound treatment, which is predicted to actively contribute to parasite-killing. α-mangostin was also found to reduce the chances of parasite survival by inhibiting arginase enzyme activity, which in favorable conditions facilitates its sustenance. This study thereby substantiates that α-mangostin significantly possesses anti-leishmanial potentiality that can be developed into a cure for this infectious disease.",

Thirty-five adults male Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups: a control group (Cont), a transected group (Sham group), a transected + diabetes mellitus group (DM), a transected + diabetes mellitus + Garcinia kola group (DM + GK), and a transected + DM + curcumin group (DM + Cur), each containing seven animals. The experimental diabetes model was created with the intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of streptozotocin. No procedure was applied to the Cont group, while sciatic nerve transection was performed on the other groups. Garcinia kola was administered to the rats in DM + GK, and curcumin to those in DM + Cur. Cardiac perfusion was performed at the end of the experimental period. Brain tissues were dissected for stereological, histopathological, and immunohistochemical evaluations. The volume ratios of hippocampal layers to the entire hippocampus volume were compared between the groups. Anti-S100, anti-caspase 3, and anti-SOX 2 antibodies were used for immunohistochemical analysis. No statistically significant difference was observed in the volume ratios of the four hippocampal layers. However, the volume ratio of the stratum lucidum was higher in the Sham, DM, and DM + Cur groups compared to the Cont group. While curcumin exhibited a protective effect on hippocampal tissue following diabetes induction, Garcinia kola had only a weak protective effect. Increased cell density and nuclear deterioration due to diabetes and nerve transection can be partially ameliorated by treatment with Garcinia kola and curcumin.",

The fraction with the most potent flavonoid and phenolic content was evaluated for its anti-inflammatory activity using both in vitro and in vivo assays. The chloroform fraction of G. pedunculata fruit extract was found to have a substantial amount of phenols and flavonoids. This fraction inhibited the denaturation of BSA and significantly stabilized human RBC membrane compared to the standard drug Diclofenac sodium. The fraction also significantly reduced the formaldehyde-induced paw edema in mice and normalized the blood parameters.

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the second leading cause of mortality globally. The increased concern for DM is due to the underlying complications accompanying hyperglycaemia, associated with oxidative stress and consequent inflammation. The investigation of safe and effective treatments for DM is necessary. In the present study, the cytotoxicity, phytochemical analysis, antioxidant capacity, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effects in an aqueous extract of Garcinia livingstonei leaves were assessed. All tested extract concentrations showed no toxicity against C3A hepatocytes. Several phenolic compounds were identified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). The total polyphenol content was 100.9741 mg GAE/g, 16.7712 mg CE/g flavanols, and 2.3548 mg QE/g flavonols. The antioxidant capacity values were 253.4268 mg AAE/g, 192.232 mg TE/g, and 167.8724 mg TE/g for ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-pycrylhydrazyl (DPPH), respectively. The plant extract significantly (p < 0.05) demonstrated anti-inflammatory and hypoglycaemic effects in a dose-dependent manner, with the α-glucosidase inhibition of the extract being higher (p < 0.05) than in the standard conventional drug (acarbose). The findings of this study revealed the potential of the constituents of G. livingstonei aqueous leaf extract in DM treatment. Further studies on the preparation and mechanisms of action of the plant in DM treatment are recommended.",

The genus is notable due to its extreme diversity of floral form, common presence in lowland tropical rainforests worldwide, and potential pharmacological value. Across its entire geographic range, Garcinia lacks a recent taxonomic revision, with the last genus-level taxonomic treatment of Garcinia conducted over 40 years ago. In order to provide an evolutionary-based framework for a revised infrageneric classification of the genus and to investigate in more detail the systematics of New Caledonian species, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses using DNA sequence data for the nuclear ITS region on all samples, and for three chloroplast intergenic spacers (psbM-trnD, trnQ-rps16 and rps16-trnK) on a subset of our overall sampling. Our phylogenetic analyses are the most comprehensive to date for the genus, containing 111 biogeographically and morphologically diverse Garcinia species. The analyses support a broad circumscription of Garcinia, including several previously segregated genera (e.g. Allanblackia, Clusianthemum, Ochrocarpos p.p., Pentaphalangium, Rheedia, and Tripetalum). We recovered nine major clades falling within two major lineages, and we delimit 11 sections. We discuss each of the clades, assign them sectional names, discuss their distinguishing morphological features, compare our taxonomic treatment with the most recent sectional treatment, list representative species, note geographic distribution, and highlight some questions that deserve future investigations. We propose nine new nomenclatural combinations, four new names, and three new lectotypes. In New Caledonia (NC), a total of ten, all endemic, species are recognized and were included in our phylogenetic analyses, with several replicates per species (with the exception of G.virgata and G.urceolata, represented by a single accession each). New Caledonian species were retrieved within three separate clades, respectively including 1) G.balansae; 2) G.comptonii, G.neglecta, G.urceolata, G.virgata; and 3) G.amplexicaulis, G.densiflora, G.pedicellata, G.puat, G.vieillardii. Within NC, the phylogenies did not support the distinction between a putative undescribed species and G.balansae. However, it confirmed the distinction between NC species and both G.vitiensis (found in Fiji and Vanuatu) and G.adinantha (found in Fiji), suggesting that all NC species should be considered as endemics."

The chemical compositions and biological activities of fruit, stem bark and root have been widely studied. However, the phytochemical components and the biological activities in Garcinia atroviridis leaves (GAL) are limited. This research aims to study the phytochemical components and the stress resistance effects of GAL in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Methods: To investigate the chemical components and antioxidant activities of GAL extract, the ethanol extract was characterized by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS) analysis and C. elegans was used to evaluate the effects of GAL extracts on longevity and stress resistance. Results and discussion: The results revealed that the ethanol extract of GAL possesses free radical scavenging activities. Furthermore, GAL extract increased the lifespan of C. elegans by 6.02%, 15.26%, and 12.75% at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL, respectively. GAL extract exhibited improved stress resistance under conditions of heat and hydrogen peroxide-induced stress. The survival rates of GAL extract-treated worms were significantly higher than those of untreated worms, and GAL extract reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Additionally, GAL extract treatment upregulated the expression of stress resistance-associated genes, including gst-4, sod-3, skn-1, and hsp16.2. GAL extract supplementation alleviated stress and enhanced longevity by inducing stress-related genes in C. elegans. The observed effects of GAL extracts may be attributed to the stimulation of oxidant enzymes mediated through DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2, as well as the enhancement of thermal defense in C. elegans. Collectively, this study provides the first evidence of the antioxidant activities of GAL and elucidates the underlying mechanisms of stress resistance."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the quality characteristics of pasteurized and thermosonicated bor-thekera (Garcinia pedunculata) juices (TSBTJs) during storage at 4 °C for 30 days. Various parameters, including pH, titratable acidity (TA), total soluble content (TSSs), antioxidant activity (AA), total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), ascorbic acid content (AAC), cloudiness (CI) and browning indexes (BI), and microbial activity, were analyzed at regular intervals and compared with the quality parameters of fresh bor-thekera juice (FBTJ). A multi-layer artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to model and optimize the ultrasound-assisted extraction of bor-thekera juice. The impacts of storage time, treatment time, and treatment temperature on the quality attributes were also explored. The TSBTJ demonstrated the maximum retention of nutritional attributes compared with the pasteurized bor-thekera juice (PBTJ). Additionally, the TSBTJ exhibited satisfactory results for microbiological activity, while the PBTJ showed the highest level of microbial inactivation. The designed ANN exhibited low mean squared error values and high R2 values for the training, testing, validation, and overall datasets, indicating a strong relationship between the actual and predicted results. The optimal extraction parameters generated by the ANN included a treatment time of 30 min, a frequency of 44 kHz, and a temperature of 40 °C. In conclusion, thermosonicated juices, particularly the TSBTJ, demonstrated enhanced nutritional characteristics, positioning them as valuable reservoirs of bioactive components suitable for incorporation in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The study underscores the efficacy of ANN as a predictive tool for assessing bor-thekera juice extraction efficiency. Moreover, the use of thermosonication emerged as a promising alternative to traditional thermal pasteurization methods for bor-thekera juice preservation, mitigating quality deterioration while augmenting the functional attributes of the juice."

      "abstract": "Despite the regulations by The World Health Organization (WHO) on the permissible limit of chromium, many industries still discharge wastewater polluted with chromium into the environment irrationally. This poses a lot of risk to aquatic lives and humans because of its carcinogenic and toxic attributes. Thus, treatment of industrial wastewater polluted with chromium is highly imperative before its disposal. Nonetheless, the hulls generated from Garcinia kola in our various farmlands also causes environmental pollution when dumped unknowingly. In this present study, Garcinia kola hull particles (GK-HP) was hydrolyzed using NaOH and applied as adsorbent for Cr(VI) sequestration. The raw Garcinia kola hull particles (rGK-HP) and modified Garcinia kola hull particles (cMGK-HP) were characterized using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier-Transform-Infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and point of zero charge (pHpzc). The influence of pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, temperature and adsorbate initial concentration on Cr(VI) sequestration were examined. The cMGK-HP was able to remove 96.25% of Cr(VI) from solution and proved to be effective than rGK-HP. The amount of Cr(VI) removed from solution decreased as the pH and adsorbate initial concentration were increased. However, the amount increased as the adsorbent dose, contact time and temperature were increased. Change in morphological structure, textural property, spectral peak, phase composition and adsorbents chemical composition before and after Cr(VI) sequestration from solution were proved by SEM, BET, FTIR, XRD, and EDS analyses respectively. The isotherm and kinetic studies suggest Cr(VI) adsorption on adsorbents' surface to be monolayer in nature and adsorption data to be well-fitted into pseudo second order model respectively. The cMGK-HP possessed excellent reusability attribute and high thermal stability as shown by TGA. In conclusion, cMGK-HP could effectively be used as an adsorbent for Cr(VI) sequestration from solution."

      "abstract": "Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) is one of the smallest free-living bacteria found in nature; it has an extremely small genome and lacks a cell wall. It is the main etiological agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia (EP), a chronic respiratory disease with worldwide distribution that causes significant losses in swine production. Due to the great economic impact caused by EP, new strategies for treating and controlling this agent are researched. The objective of this study was to verify the anti-M. hyopneumoniae activity of compounds derived from Garcinia brasiliensis and the synergism with the main antimicrobials used in the treatment of EP; this is the first study assessing the synergism between bioactive molecules and antimicrobial compounds in vitro against isolates of M. hyopneumoniae. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobials tiamulin, valnemulin, and enrofloxacin, as well as the bioactive compounds guttiferone-A (Gut-A), 7-epiculsone (7-Epic), copper 7-epiculsone (7-Epic-Cu), and benzophenone, were determined. Subsequently, the interactions of antibiotics with the compounds were evaluated using the checkerboard method. Three field M. hyopneumoniae isolates were used, and the J strain was used as a control. The MIC values of the antimicrobials compared to the field isolates were equal to and lower than those of the reference strain J. Among the compounds used, 7-Epic-Cu showed the lowest MIC value. Synergistic association was observed for Gut-A with tiamulin and valnemulin, whereas 7-Epic and 7-Epic-Cu showed synergistic action with enrofloxacin. No synergistic effect was observed for benzophenone. Despite being an initial study, the results suggest that these combinations hold promise for the treatment of infections caused by M. hyopneumoniae.",

We hypothesized that GCE-mediated inhibition of ATP citrate lyase and thereby hepatic TG production could lead to compensatory mechanisms, including increased hepatic TG uptake via lipoprotein receptors. GCE (20 mg/day) administered 40 days orally to female C57BL/6Rj mice on a standard chow diet led to a decrease in both plasma fasting and post-prandial TG-rich lipoprotein levels, but with no significant change in body weight gain. Lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) protein levels, but not those of LDL-receptor, were increased as compared to controls. Mouse Hepa1-6 cells treated with the GCE active ingredient, hydroxycitrate, also led to increased LSR protein levels. Hepatic total cholesterol, TG, and muscle TG contents were higher in GCE-treated animals as compared to controls, whereas adipose TG levels were unchanged. LSR and LDL-receptor protein levels were correlated with liver total cholesterol, but only LDL-receptor was associated with liver TG. These results show that GCE treatment in mice on a standard chow diet led to significantly increased liver and muscle lipids, with no significant change in adipose tissue TG levels, which should be considered in the long-term use of GCE.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Garcinia cowa Roxb. is called asam kandis in West Sumatra. This plant contains several quinone compounds, including tetraprenyltoluquinone (TPTQ). The bioactivity of this compound has been tested as an anticancer agent. However, reports regarding its anti-inflammatory effects are still limited, especially against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study explores the anti-inflammatory effect of TPTQ in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In silico testing used the Gnina application, opened via Google Colab. The TPTQ structure was docked with the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB) protein (PDB: 2RAM). In vitro testing began with testing the cytotoxicity of TPTQ against Raw 264.7 cells, using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. A phagocytic activity test was carried out using the neutral red uptake method, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) secretion tests were carried out using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. In vivo, tests were carried out on mice by determining cluster of differentiation 8+ (CD8+), natural killer cell (NK cell), and IL-6 parameters, using the ELISA method. RESULTS: TPTQ has a lower binding energy than the native ligand and occupies the same active site as the native ligand. TPTQ decreased the phagocytosis index and secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α experimentally in vitro. TPTQ showed significant downregulation of CD8+ and slightly decreased NK cells and IL-6 secretion in vivo. CONCLUSION: The potent inhibitory effect of TPTQ on the immune response suggests that TPTQ can be developed as an anti-inflammatory agent, especially in the treatment of Covid-19.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methods like the bio-synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using plant extracts have become promising due to their eco-friendly approach. The study aimed to examine the utilization of Garcinia gummi-gutta fruit phytochemicals as agents in the biosynthesis of Ag NPs, evaluation of the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-cancerous properties, as well as the photocatalytic ability of bio-synthesized Ag NPs against Crystal Violet (CV), a triphenylmethane dye. METHODS: The characterization of the physical properties of the Ag NPs synthesized via the green route was done using UV-Vis spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometry (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Zeta potential analysis, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The dye degradation efficiency of CV was determined using synthesized Ag NPs under UV light by analyzing the absorption maximum at 579 nm. The antimicrobial efficacy of Ag NPs against E. coli, S. aureus, Candida tropicalis, and Candida albicans was examined using the broth dilution method. The antioxidant and anti-cancer properties of the synthesized Ag NPs were assessed using the DPPH and MTT assays. RESULTS: The UV analysis revealed that the peak of synthesized Ag NPs was 442 nm. Data from FTIR, XRD, Zeta potential, SEM, and TEM analysis confirmed the formation of nanoparticles. The SEM and TEM analysis identified the presence of spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 29.12 nm and 24.18 nm, respectively. Maximum dye degradation efficiency of CV was observed at 90.08% after 320 min without any silver leaching, confirming the photocatalytic activity of Ag NPs. The bio-efficiency of the treatment was assessed using the Allium cepa root growth inhibition test, toxicity analysis on Vigna radiata, and Brine shrimp lethality assay. CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed the environmentally friendly nature of green Ag NPs over physical/chemically synthesized Ag NPs. The synthesized Ag NPs can effectively be used in biomedical and photocatalytic applications.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The polyberry gel was evaluated for various physicochemical parameters, in vitro permeability and stability, and the active phytoconstituents were quantified by High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). Total phenolic content, total antioxidants, and ascorbic acid were estimated in the two extracts by in vitro assays. Patients suffering from chronic periodontitis with probing pocket depth (PPD) up to 5 mm were divided into 3 groups of 21 patients each and treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) or SRP followed by subgingival placement of polyberry gel or tetracycline fibers (standard). Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), PPD, Clinical Attachment Level (CAL), and the salivary aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded at baseline and after 1 month. RESULTS: A significant (P < 0.01) reduction in the periodontic disease parameters was observed in the standard and gel-treated groups between their baseline and 1-month time-interval readings. The polyberry gel treatment significantly (P < 0.05 for AST and P < 0.01 for the rest) attenuated the periodontitis-elevated PI, GI PPD, CAL, AST and CRP levels when compared with SRP at the end of the study and was comparable with tetracycline. CONCLUSION: The amelioration of periodontitis and gingival inflammation may be attributed to the potent antioxidant activity of the polyphenolic phytoconstituents of the gel. The polyberry gel may thus be used as a safe adjunct to SRP/tetracycline in chronic periodontitis."

Of the many potential compounds for ACE2 and Mpro inhibition, α-mangostin is a promising candidate. Unfortunately, the potential of α-mangostin as a secondary metabolite with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is hindered due to its low solubility in water. Other xanthone isolates, which also possess the xanthone core structure like α-mangostin, are predicted to be potential alternatives to α-mangostin in COVID-19 treatment, addressing the low drug-likeness of α-mangostin. This study aims to assess the potential of xanthone derivative compounds in the pericarp of mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) through computational study. The study was conducted through screening activity using molecular docking study, drug-likeness prediction using Lipinski's rule of five filtration, pharmacokinetic and toxicity prediction to evaluate the safety profile, and molecular dynamic study to evaluate the stability of formed interactions. The research results showed that there were 11 compounds with high potential to inhibit ACE2 and 12 compounds to inhibit Mpro. However, only garcinone B, in addition to being indicated as active, also possesses a drug-likeness, pharmacokinetic, and toxicity profile that was suitable. The molecular dynamic study exhibited proper stability interaction between garcinone B with ACE2 and Mpro. Therefore, garcinone B, as a xanthone derivative isolate compound, has promising potential for further study as a COVID-19 treatment as an ACE2 and Mpro inhibitor.",

      "abstract": "Garcinia kola Heckel (Clusiaceae) is a tree indigenous to West and Central Africa. All plant parts, but especially the seeds, are of value in local folklore medicine. Garcinia kola is used in treatment of numerous diseases, including gastric disorders, bronchial diseases, fever, malaria and is used to induce a stimulating and aphrodisiac effect. The plant is now attracting considerable interest as a possible source of pharmaceutically important drugs. Several different classes of compounds such as biflavonoids, benzophenones, benzofurans, benzopyran, vitamin E derivatives, xanthones, and phytosterols, have been isolated from G. kola, of which many appears to be found only in this species, such as garcinianin (found in seeds and roots), kolanone (fruit pulp, seeds, roots), gakolanone (stem bark), garcinoic acid, garcinal (both in seeds), garcifuran A and B, and garcipyran (all in roots). They showed a wide range of pharmacological activities (e.g. analgesic, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective effects), though this has only been confirmed in animal models. Kolaviron is the most studied compound and is perceived by many studies as the active principle of G. kola. However, its research is associated with significant flaws (e.g. too high doses tested, inappropriate positive control). Garcinol has been tested under better conditions and is perhaps showing more promising results and should attract deeper research interest (especially in the area of anticancer, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective activity). Human clinical trials and mechanism-of-action studies must be carried out to verify whether any of the compounds present in G. kola may be used as a lead in the drug development."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We investigate the anticancer activity and human stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation by a new hydrated-prenylated tetraoxygenated xanthone, garcicowanone I (1) and two known xanthones (2 and 3) that were isolated from the root bark of Garcinia cowa Roxb. ex Choisy. METHODS: The anticancer activity of each compound was evaluated by sulforhodamine B assay in immortalized cancer cell lines. Stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation was assessed by western blot analysis using human THP-1-derived macrophages. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from these macrophages was also evaluated via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. KEY FINDINGS: Both compounds 1 and 3 displayed moderate inhibitory effects on the cancer cells, including a cisplatin-resistant cell line, with IC50 values in the range of 10-20 µM. All three xanthones activated the stimulator of interferon genes, as evidenced by phosphorylation of tank-binding kinase 1, the stimulator of interferon genes protein and interferon regulatory factor 3. Furthermore, treatment of these macrophages with compounds 1-3 led to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6, tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the isolated xanthones, including the novel garcicowanone I, displayed promising anticancer and immunomodulatory activity that warrants further research.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Several parts of Garcinia hanburyi are used in traditional medicine for many purposes. In this study, Garcinia hanburyi resin (GHR) was explored for possible anti-proliferative effects and the underlying mechanism on colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. METHODS: Gambogic acid (GA) content in GHR was analyzed by HPLC method. The cytotoxicities of GA and GHR were assessed in human CRC cell lines (SW480 and Caco-2) and normal colon cells (CCD841 CoN) using a trypan blue exclusion assay, MTS assay, and cell morphology analysis. Cell cycle and apoptosis at its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) were analyzed using flow cytometry. And, the levels of intrinsic apoptosis-related proteins were measured by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: GA was the major compound as 71.26% of the GHR. The cell viability of CRC cells was decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner after exposure to GHR. The selectivity index indicated that GHR had a high degree of selectivity against CRC cells. The same result was obtained for GA treatment. In addition, GHR markedly induced typical apoptotic morphology of CRC cells, but had no obvious effect on normal colon cells. GHR induced apoptosis with the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. An increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and a decrease in procaspase-3 proteins indicated that GHR promoted apoptosis by disrupting the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and the subsequent activation of caspase-3. CONCLUSION: GHR, which contained GA as an active compound, significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation via the induction of intrinsic apoptosis, while having low toxicity on normal colon cells. Therefore, GHR could be proposed as a potent candidate for the treatment of CRC."

However, there is no scientific evidence to confirm this therapeutic claim. Here, we investigated the vasorelaxing effect and its underlying mechanisms of an aqueous extract of G. cowa leaves in rat thoracic aortic rings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried leaves of G. cowa were extracted with water, followed by phytochemical analysis. Vascular reactivity experiments were performed in isolated rat thoracic aortic rings using an organ bath system. The results were recorded using the data acquisition system Power Lab. RESULTS: Phytochemical analysis showed that the leaves of G. cowa are rich in polyphenols and flavonoids, especially kaempferol, vitexin, and isovitexin. The G. cowa leaf extract caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of aortic rings. This effect was attenuated by denudation of the endothelium, or by pre-treatment of the aortic rings with l-NAME, ODQ, indomethacin, or glibenclamide, but not with TEA. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that G. cowa leaf extract induces vasorelaxation through both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent manners. Its mechanism of action mainly involves the production of nitric oxide and prostanoids, as well as opening ATP-sensitive K+ channels. The vasorelaxing effect of G. cowa leaf extract is probable promoted by the action of flavonoids."

      "abstract": "Obesity is a major global health problem which is associated with various diseases and psychological conditions. Increasing understanding of the relationship between obesity and gut microbiota has led to a worldwide effort to use microbiota as a treatment for obesity. However, several clinical trials have shown that obesity treatment with single strains of probiotics did not achieve as significant results as in animal studies. To overcome this limitation, we attempted to find a new combination that goes beyond the effects of probiotics alone by combining probiotics and a natural substance that has a stronger anti-obesity effect. In this study, we used a diet-induced obesity mouse (DIO) model to investigate the effects of combining Lactobacillus plantarum HAC03 with Garcinia cambogia extract, as compared to the effects of each substance alone. Combining L. plantarum HAC03 and G. cambogia, treatment showed a more than two-fold reduction in weight gain compared to each substance administered alone. Even though the total amount administered was kept the same as for other single experiments, the combination treatment significantly reduced biochemical markers of obesity and adipocyte size, in comparison to the treatment with either substance alone. The treatment with a combination of two substances also significantly decreased the gene expression of fatty acid synthesis (FAS, ACC, PPARγ and SREBP1c) in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT). Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the fecal microbiota suggested that the combination of L. plantarum HAC03 and G. cambogia extract treatment changed the diversity of gut microbiota and altered specific bacterial taxa at the genus level (the Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group and Lachnospiraceae UCG group) and specific functions (NAD salvage pathway I and starch degradation V). Our results support that the idea that the combination of L. plantarum HAC03 and G. cambogia extract has a synergistic anti-obesity effect by restoring the composition of the gut microbiota. This combination also increases the abundance of bacteria responsible for energy metabolism, as well as the production of SCFAs and BCAAs. Furthermore, no significant adverse effects were observed during the experiment.",

Efforts to find new therapeutic approaches are warranted to improve treatment options. Therefore, the purpose of this communication includes the phytochemical screening of a methanolic extract of Garcinia kola nuts and the in vivo evaluation of its biological activity against rats infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei and treated with 4 different concentrations of the extract (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg). Treatment with suramin served as a positive control, while the negative control received no drug. Since the general toxicity of the extract could be ruled out, efficacy was evaluated based on physiological changes, such as induction of trypanosome parasitemia, influence on body temperature, and body weight. Survival was assessed during this study. Physical parameters, behavioral characteristics, and various hematological indices were also monitored. Based on the (patho)physiological and behavioral parameters (e.g., no parasitemia, no increase in body temperature, an increase in body weight, no loss of condition, no alopecia, and no gangrene), the efficacy of the extract was evident, which was also confirmed by 100% survival, while in the negative control, all rats died during the observation period. Since overall very similar results were obtained as a result of treatment with the established suramin, the in vivo antitrypanosomal activity of a methanolic extract of G. kola nuts on rats can be demonstrated in this communication. This opens the way, for example, for further development of drug formulations based on this methanolic extract."

PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the potential of aqueous extract of Garcinia cambogia Desr. (AEGC) in PCOS. METHODOLOGY: The HPLC was used to determine the phytoconstituents present in Garcinia cambogia. Thirty adult female albino rats were divided into 6 groups: Normal control (NC) disease Control (PCOS; letrozole 1 mg/kg), plant extract (AEGC 100, 300, 500 mg/kg) and standard (metformin; 20 mg/kg). Disease was confirmed by vaginal smear cytology. After 10 weeks, animals were euthanized, ovaries dissected for histopathology, blood collected for hormonal and biochemical analysis. RESULTS: HPLC analysis showed the presence of phenolic contents; chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, coumaric acid while flavonoid contents were quercetin, kaempferol, and rutin. After treatment, there was dose dependent reduction of weight, ovarian cysts, improvement of follicle growth. DPPH radical scavenging percentage was 67.89%. Hormonal analysis showed a significant improvement (P < .05) in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen, and progesterone while a reduction in testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin level. Antioxidant enzymatic markers were significantly (P < .05) increased. Lipid profile and LFTs were also improved. CONCLUSIONS: The study validated the potential of Garcinia cambogia in the management of PCOS."

      "abstract": "Chemical and natural toxic compounds can harm human health through a variety of mechanisms. Nowadays, herbal therapy is widely accepted as a safe method of treating toxicity. Garcinia mangostana (mangosteen) is a tree in the Clusiaceae family, and isoprenylated xanthones, its main constituents, are a class of secondary metabolites having a variety of biological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, antinociceptive, neuroprotective, hypoglycemic, and anti-obesity. In this review, the protective activities of mangosteen and its major components against natural and chemical toxicities in both in vivo and in vitro experiments were evaluated. The protective effects of mangosteen and its components are mediated primarily through oxidative stress inhibition, a decrease in the number of inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, reduction of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin (PG) E2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nuclear factor-ĸB (NF-ĸB), modulation of apoptosis and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, reducing p65 entrance into the nucleus, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), improving histological conditions, and inhibition in acetylcholinesterase activity."

However, there are no studies in the literature that have investigated the effects of Garcinia gardneriana in experimental models of obesity for possible metabolic alterations. Swiss mice receiving a high-fat diet were supplemented with aqueous or ethanolic extract of G. gardneriana at doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. It was found that there was a reduction in food consumption in experimental groups compared with the control groups, and the group supplemented with aqueous extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg/daydisplayed a reduction in weight. The results showed an increase in the values of high density lipoprotein (HDL-c), total cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting blood glucose. G. gardneriana did not protect against insulin resistance, and caused in an increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) concentrations and a reduction in interleukin 10 (IL-10). In addition, hepatic steatosis and microvesicular steatosis were indicated. It was revealed that, under the experimental conditions in the study, G. gardneriana did not prevent weight gain or comorbidities; that is, a different behavior was obtained from that described in the literature with regard to the medicinal potential of the Garcinia species, which is probably related to the phytochemical properties.",

This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of garcinol isolated from Garcinia dulcis fruit in LPS-activated THP-1 and Raw 264.7 macrophages. The results demonstrated that the low concentration of garcinol did not alter cell viability. Furthermore, co-incubation of garcinol with LPS inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, and pro-inflammatory mediators, including iNOS and COX-2 at the mRNA and protein expression levels. Garcinol also decreased the secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, PGE2, and NO. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects involved an alteration in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Downregulation of pIKKα/β, pIκBα, and pNF-κB was observed, hence reducing the translocation of pNF-κB from the cytosol into the nucleus, which subsequently decreased the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. Therefore, garcinol isolated from Garcinia dulcis is a potential candidate as an anti-inflammatory agent for inflammation-related disease treatment.",

Three new biphenyl derivatives (1-3) and one new polycyclic polyprenylated benzophenone (4), together with four known benzophenone analogues (5-8), have been isolated from the CH2Cl2 extract of the twigs and leaves of G. nujiangensis. Their structures were determined by detailed spectroscopic analyses and comparison with structurally related known analogues. Experimental and calculated ECD method was used to determine the absolute configuration of 1 and 4. Moreover, compounds 5-7 were isolated for the first time from this species. The cytotoxicities of the new compounds were evaluated using HL-60, HepG2, and A549 human cancer cell lines. Compound 4 showed more significant antiproliferative effects against HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 11.38 ± 0.79 μM than that of three biphenyl derivatives. The morphological features of apoptosis were evaluated in 4-treated HepG2 cells. Compound 4 effectively prevented the cell cycle progression of HepG2 cells in G2 phase. Additionally, western blot analysis indicated that treatment of 4 on HepG2 cells led to decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-Caspase-3, and increased protein expression of both pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved PARP with reference to β-actin. Overall, our results suggested that the active polycyclic polyprenylated benzophenone derivatives in the twigs and leaves of G. nujiangensis can be used as a valuable source of bioactive compounds for the pharmaceutical industry.",

However, the effects of GD on changes in the gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles of normotensive and hypertensive rats are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles of 2-kidneys-1 clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats after feeding with GD flower extract. Rats were randomly divided into the following 4 groups: sham operation (SO) receiving corn oil (CO) (SO + CO), SO receiving GD (SO + GD), 2K1C receiving corn oil (2K1C + CO) and 2K1C receiving GD (2K1C + GD). Body weight (BW) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured weekly throughout the study. Gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were measured from fresh fecal contents. Alpha diversity results demonstrated a similar microbial richness and diversity between groups. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) suggested that GD treatment affected gut microbial community structure in both hypertensive and normotensive rats. Feeding rats with GD caused metabolic alterations that rendered 2K1C + GD rats similar to SO + CO and SO + GD rats. Findings suggest that the impact of GD on gut microbiota and metabolite profiles may be related to its anti-hypertensive properties.",

      "abstract": "Using extracted plants is an attractive option because they consist of good chemical properties against different types of bacteria, and the idea of a form modification in beads may conveniently apply to the disinfection of wastewater systems. Garcinia cowa and Piper sarmentosum leaves were extracted for the synthesis of bead materials and studied material characterizations. A disc diffusion assay, batch experiments, adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics, and desorption experiments were studied for investigating the bacteria removal efficiencies of materials. G. cowa and P. sarmentosum leaves were prepared in powder (GCP and PSP), ethanol extracted (EGC and EPS), and synthesized bead materials (GCB and PSB). GCB had a higher surface area than PSB whereas the particle size and pore size were smaller than PSB. GCP and PSP had heterogeneous cracking surfaces whereas GCB and PSB had sphere-shaped and rough surfaces. Carbon (C), oxygen (O), calcium (Ca), and functional groups of O-H, C-H, N-H, C-O, and C-Cl were found in GCP, PSP, GCB, and PSB. Both extracted and beaded materials demonstrated high antibacterial activities on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by a disc diffusion assay, and GCB demonstrated high bacteria removals on both bacteria types by almost 100% by batch experiments. Freundlich isotherm and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model are good fit models for explaining the adsorption pattern and mechanism of GCB related to a physiochemical adsorption and chemisorption mechanism. Moreover, GCB could reuse more than 3 cycles, so it is possible to use GCB for disinfection in a wastewater treatment system."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Garcinia mangostana, simply known as mangosteen, has long been used by Thai traditional medicine because of its reported antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities for the treatment of skin infections. In this study, mangosteen pericarps were developed into a hydrogel patch to eradicate acne-inducing bacteria. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: The G. mangostana extract was investigated for bactericidal activity. A hydrogel patch containing the extract was examined for mechanical properties, antibacterial activity, in vitro release, skin permeation, and a phase I clinical study of skin irritation and allergic testing by a closed patch test. FINDING/RESULTS: The G. mangostana hydrogel patch made from carrageenan and locust bean gum powders was yellow in color, smooth, durable, and flexible. This G. mangostana hydrogel patch was effective against Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The active ingredient, α-mangostin, was released and permeated from the G. mangostana hydrogel patch within the first 30 min at 33.16 ± 0.81% and 32.96± 0.97%, respectively. The G. mangostana hydrogel patch showed no irritation in 30 healthy volunteers. However, two volunteers had delayed allergic contact dermatitis to 0.5% (w/w) G. mangostana hydrogel patch. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: This hydrogel patch containing G. mangostana ethanolic extract is not recommended for patients who have any reaction to mangosteen but has utility as an anti-acne facial mask."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pharmacological intervention to induce browning of white adipose tissue provides a promising anti-obesity therapy. The fruits of Garcinia cambogia (Clusiaceae) have been widely applied to manage body weight; however, the chemical principles remain unclear. The current study aims to discover browning inducers from the fruits of G. cambogia and investigate the underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The bioactivity-based molecular networking and Oil Red O staining on 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 adipocytes were applied for guided isolation. High-fat diet-induced obese mice were recruited to evaluate the anti-obesity activity. KEY RESULTS: The bioactivity-based molecular networking-guided isolation yielded several polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols from the fruits of G. cambogia with lipid-lowering effect in adipocytes, including guttiferone J (GOJ), garcinol and 14-deoxygarcinol. As the most potent one, GOJ (10 μM) reduced lipid accumulation by 70% and 76% in 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 adipocytes, respectively. Furthermore, GOJ (2.5-10 μM) increased the expression of the deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and activated it, which, in turn, reduced the acetylation level of PPARγ coactivator-1α to boost mitochondrial biogenesis and promoted uncoupling protein 1 expression to enhance thermogenesis, resulting in browning of adipocytes. In high-fat diet-induced-obese mice, GOJ (10 and 20 mg·kg-1 ·day-1 for 12 weeks) protected against adiposity, hyperlipidaemia, insulin resistance and liver lipotoxicity, through boosting SIRT3-mediated browning of inguinal adipose tissue. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: GOJ represents a new scaffold of thermogenic inducer, which is responsible for the anti-obesity property of G. cambogia and can be further developed as a candidate for treating obesity and its related disorders.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most killing cancers and this has become a global problem. Current treatment and anticancer drugs cannot specifically target the cancerous cells, thus causing toxicity towards surrounding non-cancer cells. Hence, there is an urgent need to discover a more target-specific therapeutic agent to overcome this problem. Core-shell nanoparticles have emerged as good candidate for anticancer treatment. This study aimed to synthesize core-shell nanoparticles via green method which utilised crude peels extract of Garcinia mangostana as reducing and stabilising agents for drug delivery. Gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles (Au-AgNPs) were synthesized through seed germination process in which gold nanoparticles acted as the seed. A complete coating was observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) when the ratio of AuNPs and AgNPs was 1:9. The size of Au-AgNPs was 38.22 ± 8.41 nm and was mostly spherical in shape. Plant-based drug, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was loaded on the Au-AgNPs to investigate their anticancer activity. In HCT116 colon cancer cells, PCA-loaded Au-AgNPs (IC50 = 10.78 μg/ml) showed higher inhibitory action than the free PCA (IC50= 148.09 μg/ml) and Au-AgNPs alone (IC50= 24.36 μg/ml). Up to 80% inhibition of HCT116 cells was observed after the treatment of PCA-loaded Au-AgNPs at 15.63 μg/ml. The PCA-loaded Au-AgNPs also showed a better selectivity towards HCT116 compared to CCD112 colon normal cells when tested at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that Au-AgNPs system can be used as a potent nanocarrier to combat cancerous cells by offering additional anticancer properties to the loaded drug."

In traditional pharmacopoeia, GK seeds are used to strengthen the immune system and as a stimulant and aphrodisiac. AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic free radical scavenging effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of GK seeds (HAEGS) in a dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemic (DexIH) rat model. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was an interventional study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Here using in vivo model, we assessed some pharmacological properties of HAEGS in DexIH rat. Hypoglycemia, antihyperglycemia, spasmolytic and laxative activities were also evaluated in DexIH. In vitro study assessed antiradical activity. The HAEGS was obtained by decoction introducing 250 g with water-ethanol mixture (30:70). The plant extract was administered to the animals at doses of 50 (GK50) and 100 (GK100) mg/kg body weight. All animal experiments were in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines and were performed in accordance with the scientific procedures of UK Animals. Antiradical activity of GK was assessed in vitro by inhibition of the activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.03 software, and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: At doses 50 and 100 mg/kg, GK significantly (P < 0.001) regulated DexIH after two weeks of treatment compared to the normoglycemic control and hyperglycemic rats. The extract at both doses significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited the spasmolytic activity in both normoglycemic and hyperglycemic rats compared to Imodium®. In rats DexIH rats, only dose 100 mg/kg significantly (P < 0.05) increased laxative effects when compared to the negative control. In vitro antiradical activity of GK revealed vitamin C-like antiradical activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study justifies the traditional use of GK seeds as an antidiabetic."

For the analysis of diuretic effect, the female rats received the treatment with MEGHL (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg), DCM (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg), EtA (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 10 mg/kg), or vehicle (VEH) after an overload of saline solution. At the end 8 h of the experiment, the urinary parameters were measured. Additionally, the antiurolithic effect was analyzed, in which sodium oxalate was added in synthetic urine in the presence or absence of MEGHL, DCM, and EtA in different concentrations (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/mL). MEGHL, DCM, and EtA were able to promote 8-h diuresis in rats. MEGHL treatment at dose 30 mg/kg was accompanied by increased urinary Na+ , K+ and Cl- excretion. Moreover, the DCM and EtA fractions treatment increased K+ and Cl- excretion in the urine, although it does not cause any change in Na+ elimination. All the preparations were able to exert an antiurolithic effect in vitro, decreasing the number of calcium oxalate crystals of the monohydrate and dihydrate types. Taking together, the results presented herein showed that the preparations of G. humilis leaves are promising strategies to induce diuresis and antiurolithic effects.",

Compounds 1, 7, 8 and 18 exhibited significant neuroprotective effects on glutamate-mediated hippocampal neuronal HT22 cell death. In particular, compound 1 exhibited the most potent neuroprotective effect with >80 % cell viability in the concentration range of 2.9-115 μM. Further studies on compound 1 showed that it decreased cellular Ca2+ influx and inhibits cellular reactive oxygen species generation in HT22 cells. A Western blot analysis showed that MAPK phosphorylation, Bax, and AIF translocation dramatically increased upon treatment with 5 mM glutamate and decreased upon a co-treatment with compound 1.",

A literature search was performed using PubMed and Science Direct until March 2022. The research question was developed based on a PICO (Population, Intervention, Control and Outcomes) model. In this study, the population of interest was microbes, α-mangostin extracted from Garcinia mangostana was used as exposure while antibiotics were used as control, followed by the outcome which is determined by the antimicrobial activity of α-mangostin against studied microbes. Two reviewers independently performed the comprehensive literature search following the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A methodological quality assessment was carried out using a scoring protocol and the risk of bias in the studies was analyzed. Reward screening was performed among the selected articles to perform a meta-analysis based on the pre-determined criteria. Case groups where α-mangostin extracted from Garcinia mangostana was incorporated were compared to groups using different antibiotics or antiseptic agents (control) to evaluate their effectiveness. A total of 30 studies were included; they were heterogeneous in their study design and the risk of bias was moderate. The results showed a reduction in microbial counts after the incorporation of α-mangostin, which resulted in better disinfection and effectiveness against multiple microbes. Additionally, the meta-analysis result revealed no significant difference (p > 0.05) in their effectiveness when α-mangostin was compared to commercially available antibiotics. α-mangostin worked effectively against the tested microbes and was shown to have inhibitory effects on microbes with antibiotic resistance."

Garcinia mangostana is an interesting species because there have been identified xanthones with the potential to inhibit these enzymes. In this study, the multitarget inhibitory potential of xanthones from G. mangostana against AA, AG and PL was assessed. The methodology included the isolation and identification of bioactive xanthones, the synthesis of some derivatives and a molecular docking study. The chemical study allowed the isolation of five xanthones (1-5). Six derivatives (6-11) were synthesized from the major compound, highlighting the proposal of a new solvent-free methodology with microwave irradiation for obtaining aromatic compounds with tetrahydropyran cycle. Compounds with multitarget activity correspond to 2, 4, 5, 6 and 9, highlighting 6 with IC50 values of 33.3 µM on AA, 69.2 µM on AG and 164.4 µM on PL. Enzymatic kinetics and molecular docking studies showed that the bioactive xanthones are mainly competitive inhibitors on AA, mixed inhibitors on AG and non-competitive inhibitors on PL. The molecular coupling study established that the presence of methoxy, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups are important in the activity and interaction of polyfunctional xanthones, highlighting their importance depending on the mode of inhibition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death (PCD), is reported to play important roles in the treatment of tumors. In our previous studies, we found that neobractatin (NBT), a caged prenylxanthone isolated from edible fruits of Garcinia bracteata C. Y. Wu ex Y. H. Li, showed anticancer effects against different cancer cells. However, the effect of NBT on pyroptosis is not well understood. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate whether and how GSDME-mediated pyroptosis contributes to NBT-induced antitumor effects in esophageal cancer (EC) cells. METHODS: Cell viability assay and colony formation assay were used to determine the anticancer effects of NBT in esophageal cancer cells. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay and microscopy imaging were used to detect the main characteristic of pyroptosis. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and siRNA knockdown were performed to verify the roles of GSDME and caspase-3 in NBT-induced pyroptosis. Flow cytometry was used to measure the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and cell apoptosis. The changes of related protein level were detected by Western blot. Furthermore, animal experiments were used to verify the in vivo effect of NBT. RESULTS: The results showed that NBT reduced the viability of EC cells mainly through GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Morphologically, NBT induced cell swelling and formed large bubbles emerging from plasma membrane in wild type EC cells. Furthermore, NBT induced the cleavage of GSDME by activating caspase-3 in EC cells. On the other hand, caspase-3 activated by NBT also induced apoptosis especially at high dosage. Knocking down GSDME switched NBT-induced cell death from mainly pyroptosis to apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic studies indicated that NBT led to accumulation of ROS, which then regulated the phosphorylation of both JNK and MEK/ERK. In the absence of ROS or caspase-3, NBT-induced pyroptosis and apoptosis were completely reversed. Moreover, NBT showed a significant antitumor effect in both the KYSE150 and GSDME knockout KYSE150-/- xenograft models by inducing pyroptosis and apoptosis, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that natural compound NBT could induce GSDME-mediated pyroptosis and apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells, making it a potential therapeutic drug in clinical treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dopaminergic neuroprotection is the main interest in designing novel therapeutics against Parkinson's disease (PD). In the process of dopaminergic degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunctions and inflammation are significant. While the existing drugs provide symptomatic relief against PD, a therapy conferring total neuroprotection by targeting multiple degenerative pathways is still lacking. Garcinia morella is a common constituent of Ayurvedic medication and has been used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. The present study investigates whether administration of G. morella fruit extract (GME) in MPTP mouse model of PD protects against dopaminergic neurodegeneration, including the underlying pathophysiologies, and reverses the motor behavioural abnormalities. Administration of GME prevented the loss of dopaminergic cell bodies in the substantia nigra and its terminals in the corpus striatum of PD mice. Subsequently, reversal of parkinsonian behavioural abnormalities, viz. akinesia, catalepsy, and rearing, was observed along with the recovery of striatal dopamine and its metabolites in the experimental model. Furthermore, reduced activity of the mitochondrial complex II in the nigrostriatal pathway of brain of the mice was restored after the administration of GME. Also, MPTP-induced enhanced activation of Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the nigrostriatal pathway, which are the markers of inflammatory stress, were found to be ameliorated on GME treatment. Thus, our study presented a novel mode of dopaminergic neuroprotection by G. morella in PD by targeting the mitochondrial dysfunctions and neuroinflammation, which are considered to be intricately associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Dermatitis is a soft-tissue infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The recurrence of inflammatory skin is linked to clinical manifestations. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, which are essential for tissue damage, are released by bacteria through skin tissues. Oxidative stress causes inflammatory cells to necrotize and reduces their antioxidant profile, resulting in toxic damage to surrounding tissues. Although studies on the antibacterial effects of Thunbergia laurifolia Lindl., Curcuma longa L., Garcinia mangostana L., and Andrographis paniculata (Burm.). Bacterial infection of S. aureus have been conducted, most of these studies have been in vitro and were not related to the rabbit model. In addition, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant studies need to be evaluated. Thus, this study aims to compare the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of four local herbs with a standard antibiotic in S. aureus-induced rabbit dermatitis model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The skin of New Zealand white rabbits were artificially wounded using a sterile blade and then infected with S. aureus. The rabbits were divided into seven groups, each with three rabbits (Total 21 rabbits): The first group was the no infection group (no infection and no treatment with scarification), the second group was the no treatment group (S. aureus infection of the wound but no treatment), and the other five treated groups were T. laurifolia, C. longa, G. mangostana, A. paniculata, and bacitracin cream, all of which involved wound infection and treatments. The treatment lasted for 7 days. The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties after treatment were measured. RESULTS: The efficacy of T. laurifolia, C. longa, G. mangostana, and A. paniculata was similar to that of an antioxidant and free radical scavenging property. The bacterial infection process gradually reduced the activities of antioxidant systems (i.e., enzymatic levels and gene expressions) and total glutathione. However, the activities of the antioxidant system were steadily increased when treated with herbal extracts. During bacterial invasion of the skin, the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive molecules, the level of lipid peroxidation, and the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes were increased. All these were decreased when herbal extracts were used to treat the lesion. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that T. laurifolia, C. longa, G. mangostana, and A. paniculate extract have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties and are effective antibacterial agents. G. mangostana is the most effective herbal extract for antidermatitis and has the potential to be used as an alternative topical treatment."

      "abstract": "MATERIALS AND METHODS: G. kola methanolic extract was fractionated using increasingly polar solvents. Fractions were administered to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice until marked motor signs developed in diabetic controls. Fine motor skills indicators were measured in the horizontal grid test (HGT) to confirm the prevention of motor disorders in treated animals. Column chromatography was used to separate the most active fraction, and subfractions were tested in turn in the HGT. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique was used to assess the components of the most active subfraction. RESULTS: Treatment with ethyl acetate fraction and its fifth eluate (F5) preserved fine motor skills and improved the body weight and blood glucose level. At dose 1.71 mg/kg, F5 kept most parameters comparable to the nondiabetic vehicle group values. GC-MS chromatographic analysis of F5 revealed 36 compounds, the most abundantly expressed (41.8%) being the β-lactam molecules N-ethyl-2-carbethoxyazetidine (17.8%), N,N-dimethylethanolamine (15%), and isoniacinamide (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that subfraction F5 of G. kola extract prevented the development of motor signs and improved disease profile in an STZ-induced mouse model of diabetic encephalopathy. Antidiabetic activity of β-lactam molecules accounted at least partly for these effects."

Severely toxic and inefficient modern-day pentavalent antimonials, caters the search for naturally derived drugs, as efficient alternatives for disease treatment. The anti-promastigote activity of ten different plants selected for their ethnomedicinal properties revealed significant leishmanicidal capacity; the most potent being Garcinia cowa methanolic extract with an IC50 value of 21.4 µg/ml. Garcinia cowa, a plant endemic to North-Eastern India that is of the Clusiaceae family, is replete with such medicinal qualities as antimicrobial, antiviral, antiparasitic, and antiproliferative activities. Computational biology with its tools such as molecular docking has opened new horizons aimed at a better understanding of biological systems, complexes, and their interactions, and subsequently drug discovery via in silico techniques. Therefore, an in-silico study was designed to evaluate the binding capability of six phytochemicals- cowanin, cowanol, cowaxanthone, norcowanin, rubraxanthone, and a basic xanthone, found in Garcinia cowa against Pentamidine, a synthetic anti-leishmanial drug. The active sites of three characteristic enzymes belonging to the Leishmania donovani parasite: O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS), Trypanothione reductase (TryR), and N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) were chosen as target proteins. Results revealed lower binding energies and higher affinities, of nearly all the phytochemicals with respect to Pentamidine, indicating their leishmanicidal potential. Norcowanin showed the lowest average binding of - 9.8 kcal/mol against all the three enzymes under study."

The diabetic group was streptozotocin-induced and divided further into three treatment groups: the diabetic control group (KD), the S. duplicatum treatment group (PA), and the combination of S. duplicatum and G. mangostana treatment group (PAM). The dose of treatment was 50 mg/kg of body weight. Each group was divided into three treatment durations, which were 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days. The wound healing process was determined by wound width, the number of neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, and collagen density. Histological observation showed that the topical administration of combination extracts increased the re-epithelialization of the wounded area, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, and collagen synthesis. The topical administration of combination extracts also decreased the number of neutrophils and macrophages. This study concluded that the topical administration of the combination of S. duplicatum and G. mangostana extracts improved the open wound healing process in diabetic mice."

(GA) dried fruits (GAF) are used commercially as seasoning and in beverages. The main objective of this study was to identify a new potential neuraminidase inhibitor from GA. A bioassay-guided fractionation method was applied to obtain the bioactive compounds leading to the identification of garcinia acid and naringenin. In an enzyme inhibition study, garcinia acid demonstrated the highest activity when compared to naringenin. Garcinia acid had the highest activity, with an IC50 of 17.34-17.53 µg/mL or 91.22-92.21 µM against Clostridium perfringens-NA, and 56.71-57.85 µg/mL or 298.32-304.31 µM against H1N1-NA. Based on molecular docking results, garcinia acid interacted with the triad arginine residues (Arg118, Arg292, and Arg371) of the viral neuraminidase, implying that this compound has the potential to act as a NA enzyme inhibitor.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Garcinia mangostana, commonly also called mangosteen, is an evergreen tropical tree, and its pericarps have been used in traditional herbal medicine for different diseases. The anticancer efficacy of the ethanolic extract from the pericarps of Garcinia mangostana was investigated in human prostate cancer cells (PC3), melanoma cells (B16F10), breast cancer cells (MCF7), and glioblastoma (U87) cell lines. METHODS: 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to measure cell viability. Propidium iodide (PI) staining and analysis on a flow cytometer were used to identify apoptosis. Action on cell migration was evaluated by scratch assay and gelatin zymography. Furthermore, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured. Moreover, we investigated the synergistic efficacy with several combinations of Garcinia mangostana extract (GME) with doxorubicin. RESULTS: GME reduced cell viability in malignant cell dose time-dependently. GME-induced sub- G1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells control representing apoptotic cell death is involved in GME toxicity. Furthermore, GME exhibited inhibitory effects on the migration ability of U87 cells, which was accompanied by inhibition in the activity and expression of MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2). Besides, GSH level and SOD activity were significantly reduced while there was an increase in ROS and MDA concentration following 24 hr of GME treatment. Moreover, a combination of GME (1.5-25 μg/mL) with Dox (6 μg/mL) displayed synergistic efficacy and cell growth inhibition. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, GME could cause cell death in PC3, MCF7, U87, and B16F10 cell lines, in which apoptosis plays an imperative role. Plant extract decreased the migration ability of the cells by inhibiting the activity and expression of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). G. mangostana could be a promising therapeutic strategy to treat cancer in the future.",

Ivermectin is a drug of choice for treatment, but it may cause toxicity in dogs carrying multidrug resistance mutation-1 gene mutations. Hence, alternative herbal medicines are used instead of the drug, such as Dipterocarpus alatus oil (YN oil), Rhinacanthus nasutus leaf (WC), and Garcinia mangostana pericarps (MG) extracts. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of D. alatus oil, R. nasutus leaf, and G. mangostana pericarp extracts on canine demodicosis in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five mixed-breed dogs with localized demodicosis were examined. Dogs were diagnosed with demodicosis through deep skin scraping and screened with the inclusion criteria. Five dogs of each group were treated in five treatment groups (ivermectin, YN oil, YN oil+WC, YN oil+MG, and YN oil+WC+MG) for 1 month. The individual dogs were clinically evaluated, and the dermatological lesions were monitored daily for 60 days. RESULTS: Dermatological lesion improvement was predominantly observed in the group of dogs treated with YN oil+WC. This was evidenced by the disappearance of the hyperpigmentation and lichenification on day 28 post-treatment and alopecia on day 56 post-treatment. Moreover, no allergic or clinical signs were observed during treatment. CONCLUSION: YN oil+WC is an alternative herbal medicine that could be used for the treatment of localized canine demodicosis."

It is utilised in ethnomedicine for the treatment of diarrhoea, bronchitis, bacterial infection, cough, hepatitis, gonorrhoea, laryngitis, food poison, liver and gastric diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study reviewed the phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and ethnomedicinal potentials of G. kola. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive review was performed using electronic literature collated from ScienceDirect, Springer, Wiley, and PubMed databases. RESULTS: Phytochemical analysis revealed the isolation of several chemical compounds including 9-octadecenoic acid, linoleic acid, 14-methylpentadecanoic acid, 1-butanol, hexadecanamide, I-4',II-4',I-5,II-5,I-7,II-7-hexahydroxy-I-3,II-8-biflavanone, lanost-7-en-3-one, kolaflavanone (8E)-4-geranyl-3,5-dihydroxybenzophenone, glutinol, Garcinia biflavonoid (GB-2a-II-4'-OMe), 9,19-cyclolanost-24-en-3-ol, 24-methylene, tirucallol, lupeol, β-amyrin, obtusifoliol and Kolaviron. Diverse pharmacological in-vivo and in vitro investigations revealed that G. kola has anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, anti-asthmatic, neuroprotective, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that G. kola has preventive and therapeutic potentials against various diseases in both in vivo and in vitro studies and therefore can be utilised as a raw material in the pharmaceutical industries for the development of therapeutic products. However, there is a need for clinical trial experiments to validate and provide accurate and substantial information on the required safe dosage and efficacy for the treatment of several diseases.",

      "abstract": "Acanthamoeba keratitis infection extends due to the growing number of contact lens users. Indigenous plants including Garcinia mangostana play a vital role in human health and well being. Many species of this plant have been reported with myriads of potent medicinal properties. However, the aims of this study were, for the first time, to isolate compounds from the flower of G. mangostana and to test their anti-Acanthamoeba and anti-adhesion activity against Acanthamoeba triangularis. Powdered flowers of G. mangostana were extracted and chromatographed on a silica gel column. The structures of the compounds were established with the aid of 1H NMR. More so, the anti-Acanthamoeba and anti-adhesion properties were tested on a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate and soft contact lenses. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to determine the features of A. triangularis on contact lenses. Eight pure compounds were obtained, namely 9-hydroxycalabaxanthone, tovophillin A, garcinone E, garcinone B, α-mangostin, gartinin, 8-deoxygartinin and γ-mangostin. The extract and pure compounds exhibited anti-Acanthamoeba activity with MIC values in the range of 0.25-1 mg/mL. In addition, the extract and α-mangostin displayed significant activity against the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites both in polystyrene plate and in contact lenses at 0.5 × MIC (0.25 mg/mL). Furthermore, α-mangostin has the potential to remove A. triangularis adhesion in contact lenses similar to a commercial multipurpose solution (MPS). SEM study confirmed that crude extract and α-mangostin are effective as solutions for contact lenses, which removed A. triangularis trophozoites within 24 h. Alpha-mangostin was non-toxic to Vero cells at a concentration below 39 μM in 24 h. Crude extract of G. mangostana flower and its α-mangostin serve as candidate compounds in the treatment of Acanthamoeba infection or as lens care solution, since they can be used as a source of natural products against Acanthamoeba and virulence factor associated with the adhesion of A. triangularis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in chemotherapies and targeted drugs, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains challenging to treat due to drug resistance. Emerging evidence indicates that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) facilitate the generation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and drug resistance. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK) associated signaling pathways have been implicated in the generation of CSCs and represent a target for therapeutics development. HYPOTHESIS: Gamma-mangostin (gMG) isolated from Garcinia mangostana was evaluated for its ability to downregulate GSK3β-associated signaling in CRC cells and overcome CAF-induced 5-fluorouracil resistance and CSC generation. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis, in silico molecular docking, in vitro assays, including cell viability tests, colony- and tumor sphere-formation assays, transwell migration assays, ELISA, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, miR expression, qPCR, and flow cytometry, as well as in vivo mouse xenograft models were used to evaluate the antitumor effects of gMG. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analyses indicated that GSK3β/CDK6/β-catenin mRNA signature was significantly higher in colon cancer patients. Additional algorithms predicted a higher miR-26b level was associated with significantly higher survival in CRC patients and GSK3β and CDK6 as targets of miR-26b-5p. To validate these findings in vitro, we showed that CAF-cocultured CRC cells expressed an increased expression of GSK3β, β-catenin, CDK6, and NF-κB. Therapeutically, we demonstrated that gMG treatment suppressed GSK3β-associated signaling pathways while concomitantly increased the miR-26b-5p level. Using a xenograft mouse model of CAFs cocultured HCT116 tumorspheres, we showed that gMG treatment reduced tumor growth and overcame CAF-induced 5-fluorouracil resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological intervention with gMG suppressed CRC carcinogenesis and stemness via downregulating GSK3/β-catenin/CDK6 and upregulating the miR-26b-5p tumor suppressor. Thus, gMG represents a potential new CRC therapeutic agent and warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "There is a need to advance commercial poultry production to cater to the essential protein needs of an ever-increasing population, however, the rampant occurrence of coccidiosis infection poses a threat to this achievement. This study evaluated the in vivo anticoccidial activities of the extracts and fractions of Garcinia kola against experimental Eimeria tenella infection using broiler chickens as experimental subjects. A total of 40 broiler chicks were experimentally infected with E. tenella and assigned randomly into five groups consisting of eight chicks each. Three days post experimental infection groups I and II were administered orally with tween 80 (0.8%) and Amprolium (30 mg/kg) and served as untreated and treated control groups, respectively whereas Groups III, IV, and V were administered orally with crude methanol extract (CME) at doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg, respectively, for five consecutive days. Daily weight gains were recorded and faecal oocysts per gram (OPG) counts were made by the McMaster Egg counting technique. Blood samples from each experimental group were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 8 for haematological examination. In the acute toxicity studies, the CME of G. kola did not produce any toxic effect or mortality at doses between 10 and 5000 mg/kg. The CME G. kola was then considered safe and the LD50 was assumed to be > 5000 mg/kg. Graded doses of CME of G. kola considerably (P < 0.05) improved body weight gain and decreased OPG in a dose-depended manner. There was also significant improvement in the Packed Cell Volume (PCV), Red Blood Cell (RBC) and White Blood Cell (WBC) counts upon treatment with the graded doses of CME of G. kola. Besides, G. kola significantly decreased histopathological lesions in the caecum. The results of this study indicates that G. kola may provide beneficial effects against E. tenella-induced coccidiosis in broiler chickens."

In this study, the effects of an extract of Garcinia kola seeds and garcinoic acid were investigated in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1-stimulated human PBMCs. Results of ELISA experiments revealed that Garcinia kola extract (6.25, 12.5, and 25 μg/ml) and garcinoic acid (1.25, 2.5, and 5 μM) significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1-induced secretion of TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 in PBMCs. In-cell western assays showed that pre-treatment with Garcinia kola extract and garcinoic acid reduced expressions of both phospho-p65 and phospho-IκBα proteins, as well as NF-κB DNA binding capacity and NF-κB-driven luciferase expression following stimulation of PBMCs with spike protein S1. Furthermore, pre-treatment of PBMCs with Garcinia kola extract prior to stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 resulted in reduced damage to adjacent A549 lung epithelial cells. These results suggest that the seed of Garcinia kola and garcinoic acid are natural products which may possess pharmacological/therapeutic benefits in reducing cytokine storm in severe SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections.",

The isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activity by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods. The antidiabetic activity was performed against α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzymes. The antiplasmodial activity was evaluated using Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 sensitive to chloroquine. Molecular docking analysis on the human lysosomal acid-alpha-glucosidase enzyme (5NN8) and P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase enzyme (1CET) and prediction of ADMET for the active compound, were also studied. For the first time, lichexanthone (1), subelliptenone H (2), 12b-hydroxy-des-D-garcigerrin A (3), garciniaxanthone B (4) and garcigerin A (5) were isolated from the CH2Cl2 extract of the stem bark of G. forbesii. Four xanthones (Compounds 2-5) showed strong antioxidant activity. In vitro α-glucosidase test showed that Compounds 2 and 5 were more active than the others, while Compound 4 was the strongest against α-amylase enzymes. In vitro antiplasmodial evaluation revealed that Compounds 2 and 3 showed inhibitory activity on P. falciparum. Molecular docking studies confirmed in vitro activity. ADMET predictions suggested that Compounds 1-5 were potential candidates for oral drugs. The isolated 2-5 can be used as promising phytotherapy in antidiabetic and antiplasmodial treatment."

      "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are significant risk factors for chronic heart failure (HF). Since pharmacotherapy agents targeting these processes have not been established, we investigated the effect of alpha-magostin (α-man) on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in vitro. Primary cultured cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were prepared from neonatal rats. After α-man treatment, phenylephrine (PE) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) were added to the cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts to induce hypertrophic and fibrotic responses, respectively. Hypertrophic responses were assessed by measuring the cardiomyocyte surface area and hypertrophic gene expression levels. PE-induced phosphorylation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and p38 was examined by Western blotting. Fibrotic responses were assessed by measuring collagen synthesis, fibrotic gene expression levels, and myofibroblast differentiation. In addition, TGF-β-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was investigated. In cultured cardiomyocytes, α-man significantly suppressed PE-induced increases in the cardiomyocyte surface area, and the mRNA levels (atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)). Treatment with α-man significantly suppressed PE-induced Akt phosphorylation, but not ERK and p38 phosphorylation. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, α-man significantly suppressed TGF-β-induced increases in L-proline incorporation, mRNA levels (POSTN and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)), and myofibroblast differentiation. Additionally, it significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase4 (NOX4) expression and ROS production in cardiac fibroblasts. Treatment with α-man significantly ameliorates hypertrophy by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes and fibrosis by inhibiting NOX4-generating ROS in fibroblasts. These findings suggest that α-man is a possible natural product for the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The fruit of Garcinia is a rich and valuable source of bioactive compounds and is traditionally used for treating wounds and ulcers. The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effect of chromatographically standardized fruit extract of Garcinia cowa (GCE) on ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: The effect of GCE (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) was evaluated by determining various gastric ulcer parameters like gastric wall mucus, non-protein sulfhydryls (NP-SH) content, microvascular permeability, endogenous antioxidant enzyme, and gastric histopathological study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of GCE at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg exhibited significant (p < .01) dose-dependent inhibition of ulcer index by 18.94-44.02%, respectively. Pre-treatment of rats with GCE (400 mg/kg) significantly restored the depleted gastric wall mucus level by 34.09% and NP-SH content by 33.35% induced by ethanol administration. In addition, GCE (400 mg/kg) showed a significant decrease in microvascular permeability of Evans Blue by 47.43%, rationalizing its protective effect. Furthermore, a significant increase in oxidative enzyme levels with reduction in malondialdehyde level and elevation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was observed in the GCE treated group as compared to the ulcer control group. The histopathological assessment also confirmed the protective nature of GCE. HPTLC analysis showed the presence of 0.27%, 0.11% w/w gallic acid, and amentoflavone, respectively in GCE. The content of α-mangostin and xanthochymol in the G. cowa extract sample quantified by HPLC-PDA method was 0.72 and 8.46%, respectively. The results obtained indicate that the protective effect of GCE against gastric ulcers in rats through multiple actions confirmed by the reduction of oxidative stress and restoration of adhered gastric mucus, NP-SH content, and histological architecture.KEY MESSAGESEthanol is the most typical ulcerogenic agent and has been shown to extend the risk of ulcer in humans.Natural products are promising alternative medication for the development of new drugs to regulate gastrointestinal diseases.Garcinia cowa protects the gastric mucosa through multiple actions that include restoration of adhered gastric mucus and inhibition of lipid peroxidation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with breast cancer being the most common invasive cancer type in women. Several therapeutic strategies have been explored to reduce the mortality rates of breast cancer. Chemotherapy is the most commonly used systemic treatment, but associated with numerous side-effects. Development of anticancer agents with high efficacy and minimal negative effects is therefore an important focus of research. Natural materials provide an excellent source of bioactive compounds. For instance, Garcinia porrecta from the Clusiaceae family has multiple pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-HIV, antidepressant, and anticancer properties. PURPOSE: The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential anticancer effects of compounds extracted from the bark of G. porrecta. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our experiments were divided into three steps: (1) chromatographic isolation of compounds using various separation techniques, such as extraction, separation and purification, (2) characterization via infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy, and (3) evaluation of anticancer activity in vitro (MTT assay) and in silico (via analysis of molecular docking against caspase-9, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)). RESULTS: Depsidone (1) and benzophenone (2) from the ethyl acetate extract of bark of G. porrecta were identified as bioactive components. Examination of the activities of these compounds against MCF-7 cells revealed an IC50 value of 119.3 µg/mL for benzophenone, whereas IC50 for depsidone could not be estimated. Benzophenone activity was lower than that of the positive control doxorubicin (6.9 µg/mL). Depsidone showed the highest binding affinity for HER-2 (-9.2 kcal.mol-1) and benzophenone for ER-α (-8.0 kcal.mol-1). CONCLUSION: Benzophenone displays potency as an anticancer agent through blocking ER-α.",

      "abstract": "We reported recently that the elevated plus maze is a good tool for evaluating cognitive and motor functional changes in gamma-irradiated rats as a model for new drug evaluation and monitoring. The capacity of Garcinia kola to mitigate radiation-induced brain injury is currently unknown. We therefore assessed the effects of the neuroprotective medicinal plant Garcinia kola, on the cognitive and motor changes in this murine model of acute radiation syndrome. Wistar rats exposed once to an ionizing dose of Tc99m-generated Gamma radiation were treated with an ethyl acetate fraction of methanolic extract of Garcinia kola seeds (content of 100 mg/kg of extract) for 9 weeks. Cognitive and motor function indicators were assessed in the elevated plus maze in these animals and compared with irradiated control groups (vitamin C- and vehicle-treated groups) and the non-irradiated control rats. The irradiated control group displayed cachexia, shaggy and dirty fur, porphyrin deposits around eyes, decreased exploratory activity, reduced social interactions and a loss of thigmotaxis revealed by a marked decrease in rearing episodes and stretch attend posture episodes close to the walls of elevated plus maze closed arm, an increased central platform time, and decreases in open arm time and entries. This group further displayed a decrease in head dips and grooming episodes. Treatment with Garcinia kola, and in a lesser extent vitamin C, significantly prevented the body weight loss (P < 0.001) and mitigated the development of elevated plus maze signs of cognitive and motor affections observed in the irradiated control group (P < 0.05). Altogether, our data suggest for the first time that Garcinia kola seeds have protective properties against the development of cognitive and motor decline in the acute radiation syndrome-like context. Future studies are warranted to characterize the molecular mechanisms and neuronal networks of this action."

Mangosteen contains various antioxidants may scavenge free radical produced by H2O2. This study examined the effects of mangosteen peel infusion on the liver and kidney of rats after H2O2 induction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six female Wistar rats were divided into six groups: Negative control, positive control (1% H2O2), as well as mangosteen peel infusion groups at a concentration of 0.25; 0.5; 1, and 2%. H2O2 induction was administered orally every day for 2 months followed by mangosteen peel infusion treatment (1 month) after H2O2 induction for 1 month. At the end of the experiment, the rats were sacrificed. The liver and kidney of each rat were collected for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and histopathological examinations. Furthermore, blood was collected for creatinine examination. RESULTS: H2O2 induction caused the highest ROS level elevation in the positive control group which was treated with H2O2 only. Meanwhile, 2% of mangosteen peel infusion returned the ROS levels to normal. It was also observed that mangosteen peel infusion restored creatinine levels to normal. Furthermore, 2% of mangosteen peel infusion improved the histopathological structure of the liver and kidneys after H2O2 induction. CONCLUSION: Mangosteen peel infusion especially at a concentration of 2% has the potential to improve liver and kidney structure and functions after H2O2 induction."

      "abstract": "Mitotic kinesin Eg5 remains a validated target in antimitotic therapy because of its essential role in the formation and maintenance of bipolar mitotic spindles. Although numerous Eg5 inhibitors of synthetic origin are known, only a few inhibitors derived from natural products have been reported. In our study, we focused on identifying novel Eg5 inhibitors from medicinal plants, particularly Garcinia species. Herein, we report the inhibitory effect of kolaflavanone (KLF), a Garcinia biflavonoid, on the ATPase and microtubule-gliding activities of mitotic kinesin Eg5. Additionally, we showed the interaction mechanism between Eg5 and KLF via in vitro and in silico analyses. The results revealed that KLF inhibited both the basal and microtubule-activated ATPase activities of Eg5. The inhibitory mechanism is allosteric, without a direct competition with adenosine-5'-diphosphate for the nucleotide-binding site. KLF also suppressed the microtubule gliding of Eg5 in vitro. The Eg5-KLF model obtained from molecular docking showed that the biflavonoid exists within the α2/α3/L5 (α2: Lys111-Glu116 and Ile135-Asp149, α3: Asn206-Thr226; L5: Gly117-Gly134) pocket, with a binding pose comparable to known Eg5 inhibitors. Overall, our data suggest that KLF is a novel allosteric inhibitor of mitotic kinesin Eg5.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The rapid spread of antimalarial drug resistance is becoming a problem in the treatment of malaria. The fact was indicated the importance of finding new antimalarial drugs. The genus Garcinia is well known to be a rich source of bioactive prenylated xanthones and triterpenes reported for their antimalarial activity. Garcinia parvifolia is one of the Garcinia genera that can be explored for the search of new antimalarial drugs. This study was aimed to determine the antimalarial activities of G. parvifolia extracts and fractions. METHODS: Garcinia parvifolia Miq. stem was collected from Balikpapan Botanical Garden in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, was extracted gradually with n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol by ultrasonic assisted method. The most active extract was further separated using the open column chromatography method. All extracts and fractions were tested against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and followed by IC50 determination. RESULTS: The results showed that all extracts inhibit P. falciparum growth by LDH assay. The highest inhibition was showed by dichloromethane stem extract (BP12-S-D) with the IC50 value of 6.61 ± 0.09 μg/mL. Further fractionation of BP12-S-D has obtained 10 fractions. All of them were identified by TLC, and a brownish-yellow spot (fraction-1) appears after spraying with 10% H2SO4. Fraction-1 (F1) performed the highest parasite growth inhibition with the IC50 value of 6.00 ± 0.03 μg/mL compared with other fractions. This fraction was classified as having a promising activity of antimalarial. The fraction-1 was identified using HPLC, and two major peaks were observed (A and B). The UV-Vis spectra showed the absorption at wavelengths 250 and 278 (A), 243, 281, and 317 nm (B). Based on the profile of TLC, HPLC, and UV-Vis spectra of F1, it was expected that the active compounds are flavonoid (A) and xanthone (B). CONCLUSIONS: The fraction-1 of dichloromethane extract of G. parvifolia Miq. stem has the highest antimalarial activity. It might be a potential candidate for the new antimalarial drug.",

Essential oil is reported to exhibit pharmacological properties, besides its common and well-known function as aromatherapy. Therefore, this study herein aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative effect of essential oil extracted from leaves of Garcinia atroviridis (EO-L) against PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell line. The cell growth inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50) and selective index (SI) values of EO-L analyses were determined as 78 µg/mL and 1.23, respectively. Combination index (CI) analysis revealed moderate synergism (CI values of 0.36 to 0.75) between EO-L and 2 deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) treatments. The treatments of PANC-1 cells with EO-L, 2-DG and EOL+2DG showed evidence of depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell growth arrest and apoptosis. The molecular mechanism causing the anti-proliferative effect between EO-L and 2-DG is potentially through pronounced up-regulation of P53 (4.40-fold), HIF1α (1.92-fold), HK2 (2.88-fold) and down-regulation of CYP3A5 (0.11-fold), as supported by quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Collectively, the current data suggest that the combination of two anti-proliferative agents, EO-L and 2-DG, can potentially be explored as therapeutic treatments and as potentiating agents to conventional therapy against human pancreatic cancer.",

Garcinia mangostana pericarp (GMP) possesses antihyperglycemic, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of GMP extract on cerebral inflammation in Wistar rats with T2DM by examining the expression levels of glial nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). A total of 36 8-10-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups and provided a standard diet (normal control; C1), high-fat diet (HFD) with 200 g/kg GMP extract BW/day (GMP control; C2), HFD with streptozotocin-nicotinamide (diabetic control; C3), and HFD with 100 (M1), 200 (M2) or 400 g/kg body weight (BW)/day (M3) GMP extract for Wistar rats with diabetes. GMP extract was administered for 8 weeks after induction of T2DM was confirmed. Glial NF-κB activity was assessed by immunohistochemical staining, and by measuring IL-6 levels, TNF-α levels and SOD activity in the serum using ELISA. BW significantly increased following HFD treatment. After 7 weeks, the BW remained significantly higher compared with the normal control and GMP extract-treated groups, but decreased continuously in the T2DM groups. Glial NF-κB immunoreaction in the hippocampal region was significantly higher in the diabetic Wistar rats compared with the normal control Wistar rats, and 200 g/kg BW/day GMP significantly reduced its activity. The T2DM Wistar rats showed significantly higher expression levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-α and lower activity of SOD compared with the normal control Wistar rats. Meanwhile, rats in GMP groups M1, M2 and M3 exhibited significant reductions in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α expression, and increases in SOD activity. GMP extract treatment effectively reduced hippocampal NF-κB, IL-6 and TNF-α levels and increased antioxidant SOD activity. These results suggest that GMP extract prevents cerebral inflammation in T2DM Wistar rats."

The aim of this study was to study the involvement of AQPs and explore the anti-inflammatory activity of Garcinia extract in LPS induced acute systemic inflammation in Wistar rats. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 6) were pretreated with Garcinia orally twice for 7 days, followed by a single intraperitoneal dose (5.5 mg/kgbw) of LPS. Serum ALT, AST, ALP, Creatinine, Urea and BUN, nitric oxide, prostaglandin, cytokine and chemokine levels were measured. LC-MS analysis of Garcinia was performed to identify the phytoconstituents present. The iNOS and COX enzyme activity were determined in the target tissues. qPCR analysis of inos, cox-2 and aqps was performed. Relative protein expression of AQPs was studied by Western blot analysis. Molecular docking studies were performed to study the interaction of garcinol and hydroxycitric acid, the two important phytoconstituents of Garcinia with AQP. The qPCR analysis showed tissue-specific up-regulation of aqp1, aqp3, aqp4 and aqp8 in LPS induced rats. Garcinia extract treatment effectively lowered the mRNA expression of these AQPs. Garcinia extract significantly inhibited the LPS-induced NO, prostaglandin, cytokine and chemokine production in serum and also decreased tissue-specific transcript level of inos and cox-2, thus suggesting the anti-inflammatory role of Garcinia. Also, docking studies revealed interactions of garcinol and hydroxycitric acid with AQP1, 3, 4 and 8. Therefore, the present study suggests the possible involvement of AQP1, 3, 4 and 8 in inflammation and the efficacy of Garcinia extract as an anti-inflammatory agent. Therefore, AQPs can act as prognostic markers of inflammation and can be targeted with Garcinia extract.",

      "abstract": "The overexpansion of adipose tissues leads to obesity and eventually results in metabolic disorders. Garcinia cambogia (G. cambogia) has been used as an antiobesity supplement. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of G. cambogia on cellular processes have yet to be fully understood. Here, we discovered that G. cambogia attenuated the expression of CEBPB (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), beta), an important adipogenic factor, suppressing its transcription in differentiated cells. In addition, G. cambogia inhibited macroautophagic/autophagic flux by decreasing autophagy-related gene expression and autophagosome formation. Notably, G. cambogia markedly elevated the expression of KLF3 (Kruppel-like factor 3 (basic)), a negative regulator of adipogenesis, by reducing SQSTM1/p62-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Furthermore, increased KLF3 induced by G. cambogia interacted with CTBP2 (C-terminal binding protein 2) to form a transcriptional repressor complex and inhibited Cebpa and Pparg transcription. Importantly, we found that RPS6KA1 and STAT3 were involved in the G. cambogia-mediated regulation of CEBPB and autophagic flux. In an obese animal model, G. cambogia reduced high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity by suppressing epididymal and inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue mass and adipocyte size, which were attributed to the regulation of targets that had been consistently identified in vitro. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of G. cambogia-mediated regulation of adipogenesis and suggest molecular links to therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; ACTB: actin beta; ATG: autophagy-related; Baf: bafilomycin A1; BECN1: beclin 1; CEBP: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP); CHX: cycloheximide; CREB: cAMP response element binding protein; CTBP: C-terminal binding protein; EGCG: (-)-epigallocatechin gallate; eWAT: epididymal white; G. cambogia: Garcinia cambogia; GFP: green fluorescent protein; H&E: hematoxylin and eosin; HFD: high-fat diet; iWAT: inguinal subcutaneous white; KLF: Kruppel-like factor; LAP: liver-enriched transcriptional activating proteins; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; ND: normal diet; PPARG: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; qPCR: quantitative real-time PCR; RFP: red fluorescent protein; RPS6KA1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1; siRNA: small-interfering RNA; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; TEM: transmission electron microscopy.",

HIV-1-RNase H assay was used to study the RNase H inhibition by garcinol and isogarcinol. Docking of garcinol into the active site of the enzyme was carried out to rationalize the difference in activities between the two compounds. Garcinol showed higher HIV-1-RNase H inhibition than the known inhibitor RDS1759 and retained full potency against the RNase H of a drug-resistant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase form. Isogarcinol was distinctly less active than garcinol, indicating the importance of the enolizable β-diketone moiety of garcinol for anti-RNase H activity. Docking calculations confirmed these findings and suggested this moiety to be involved in the chelation of metal ions of the active site. On the basis of its HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H inhibitory activity, garcinol is worth being further explored concerning its potential as a cost-effective treatment for HIV patients.",

In complementarity, the present study evaluated the prolonged diuretic and renoprotective effects of TDP in both NTR and SHR. The animals received, once a day, oral treatment with TDP (0.1 mg/kg), hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg), or vehicle (VEH; 10 mL/kg). At the end of 7 days, the urine, blood, and kidney samples were collected for biochemical and histological analyzes. The urinary volume of both NTR and SHR after 7 days of treatment with the TDP was significantly increased, associated with augmented urinary electrolyte excretion levels. The treatments did not modify the urinary pH values nor the parameters analyzed in plasma (Na+, K+, Cl-, and Ca2+). Concerning the renal analyzes, when compared with the VEH-treated NTR group, while the activity of the enzymes catalase (CAT) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), as well as nitrite levels, were increased, the generation of lipid hydroperoxides and the activity of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) were unaltered. On the other hand, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in kidney homogenates of the SHR group were decreased. However, TDP augmented the levels of GSH and GST activities and reduced the levels of nitrite and the activities of CAT and MPO, when compared with VEH-treated only SHR. Besides, the treatment with TDP alleviated the morphological changes of the renal corpuscle region of SHR. Together, these results revealed the prolonged diuretic effect of TDP and their renal protective effect by improving the antioxidative capacity."

The hexane-soluble portion of MeOH extracts of G. subelliptica leaves that showed cytotoxic activity was separated to yield seven compounds 1-7. Chemical structure analysis using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry confirmed that compound 1 was canophyllol, and compounds 2-7 were garcinielliptones N, O, J, G, F, and garcinielliptin oxide, respectively. Among them, garcinielliptone G (5) showed growth inhibition by causing apoptosis in THP-1 and Jurkat cells derived from human acute monocytic leukemia and T lymphocyte cells, respectively. Apoptosis induced by garcinielliptone G (5) was demonstrated by the detection of early apoptotic cells with fluorescein-labeled Annexin V and increases in cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP protein levels. However, the addition of caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not affect growth arrest or apoptosis induction. These results suggest that garcinielliptone G (5) can induce both caspase-3 activation and caspase-independent apoptosis. Therefore, garcinielliptone G (5) may be a potential candidate for acute leukemia treatment.",

Chlorhexidine is effective for AK treatment as monotherapy, but with a relative failure on drug bioavailability in the deep corneal stroma. The combination of chlorhexidine and propamidine isethionate is recommended in the current AK treatment. However, the effectiveness of treatment depends on the parasite and virulence strains. This study aims to determine the potential of Garcinia mangostana pericarp extract and α-mangostin against Acanthamoeba triangularis, as well as the combination with chlorhexidine in the treatment of Acanthamoeba infection. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the extract and α-mangostin were assessed in trophozoites with 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL, for cysts with 4 and 1 mg/mL, respectively. The MIC of the extract and α-mangostin inhibited the growth of A. triangularis trophozoites and cysts for up to 72 h. The extract and α-mangostin combined with chlorhexidine demonstrated good synergism, resulting in a reduction of 1/4-1/16 of the MIC. The SEM results showed that Acanthamoeba cells treated with a single drug and its combination caused damage to the cell membrane and irregular cell shapes. A good combination displayed by the extract or α-mangostin and chlorhexidine, described for the first time. Therefore, this approach is promising as an alternative method for the management of Acanthamoeba infection in the future.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) with multiple functionalities are intriguing candidates for various biomedical applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study introduced a simple and green synthesis of Fe3O4 NPs using a low-cost stabilizer of plant waste extract rich in polyphenols content with a well-known antioxidant property as well as anticancer ability to eliminate colon cancer cells. Herein, Fe3O4 NPs were fabricated via a facile co-precipitation method using the crude extract of Garcinia mangostana fruit peel as a green stabilizer at different weight percentages (1, 2, 5, and 10 wt.%). The samples were analyzed for magnetic hyperthermia and then in vitro cytotoxicity assay was performed. RESULTS: The XRD planes of the samples were corresponding to the standard magnetite Fe3O4 with high crystallinity. From TEM analysis, the green synthesized NPs were spherical with an average size of 13.42±1.58 nm and displayed diffraction rings of the Fe3O4 phase, which was in good agreement with the obtained XRD results. FESEM images showed that the extract covered the surface of the Fe3O4 NPs well. The magnetization values for the magnetite samples were ranging from 49.80 emu/g to 69.42 emu/g. FTIR analysis verified the functional groups of the extract compounds and their interactions with the NPs. Based on DLS results, the hydrodynamic sizes of the Fe3O4 nanofluids were below 177 nm. Furthermore, the nanofluids indicated the zeta potential values up to -34.92±1.26 mV and remained stable during four weeks of storage, showing that the extract favorably improved the colloidal stability of the Fe3O4 NPs. In the hyperthermia experiment, the magnetic nanofluids showed the acceptable specific absorption rate (SAR) values and thermosensitive performances under exposure of various alternating magnetic fields. From results of in vitro cytotoxicity assay, the killing effects of the synthesized samples against HCT116 colon cancer cells were mostly higher compared to those against CCD112 colon normal cells. Remarkably, the Fe3O4 NPs containing 10 wt.% of the extract showed a lower IC50 value (99.80 µg/mL) in HCT116 colon cancer cell line than in CCD112 colon normal cell line (140.80 µg/mL). DISCUSSION: This research, therefore, introduced a new stabilizer of Garcinia mangostana fruit peel extract for the biosynthesis of Fe3O4 NPs with desirable physiochemical properties for potential magnetic hyperthermia and colon cancer treatment.",

Approved antiviral therapies or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of CHIKV infections are not available. As diverse natural phenolic compounds have been shown to possess antiviral activities, we explored the antiviral activity of α-Mangostin, a xanthanoid, against CHIKV infection. METHODS: The in vitro prophylactic and therapeutic effects of α-Mangostin on CHIKV replication in Vero E6 cells were investigated by administering it under pre, post and cotreatment conditions. The antiviral activity was determined by foci forming unit assay, quantitative RT-PCR and cell-based immune-fluorescence assay. The molecular mechanism of inhibitory action was further proposed using in silico molecular docking studies. RESULTS: In vitro studies revealed that 8 µM α-Mangostin completely inhibited CHIKV infectivity under the cotreatment condition. CHIKV replication was also inhibited in virus-infected mice. This is the first in vivo study which clearly showed that α-Mangostin is effective in vivo by significantly reducing virus replication in serum and muscles. Molecular docking indicated that α-Mangostin can efficiently interact with the E2-E1 heterodimeric glycoprotein and the ADP-ribose binding cavity of the nsP3 macrodomain. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that α-Mangostin can inhibit CHIKV infection and replication through possible interaction with multiple CHIKV target proteins and might act as a prophylactic/therapeutic agent against CHIKV.",

      "abstract": "Garcinia gardneriana is a medicinal tree species used in Brazil in the treatment of hepatitis and gastritis. This use is attributed to phenolic compounds, mainly 7-epiclusianone, guttiferone-A and fukugetin, which present several proven biological activities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study on the phytotoxic activity of G. gardneriana extracts has been conducted until now. This research proposed to isolate and quantify by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) the major compounds from G. gardneriana seed extracts in ethyl acetate and to evaluate their phytotoxic activities. The natural products 7-epiclusianone, guttiferone-A and fukugetin were quantified at concentrations varying from 0.46 to 1.13 mg mL-1 and were isolated with yields ranging from 7% to 23% (w/w). The phytotoxic assay indicated that the crude extract showed no action on the dry matter of Sorghum bicolor plants, but the isolated compounds fukugetin and 7-epiclusianone had moderate activity. On the other hand, guttiferone-A displayed a greater herbicide activity than glyphosate, a positive control, even in almost three times lower concentrations, causing severe intoxication in the plants. This work is the first report on this activity by the extract of G. gardneriana and its isolated compounds. Besides that, guttiferone-A showed up as a scaffold for the development of new agrochemicals. Complementing these findings, computational studies suggested that this benzophenone can interact effectively with transferase enzymes type, in special caffeic acid O-methyltransferase from S. bicolor (PDB code: 4PGH), indicating a possible mechanism of action in this plant.",

Traditionally, this plant is believed to be of immense medicinal importance and is used for the treatment of various ailments. In Assam, the acidic fruit of GP is effectively used in folklore medicine to treat gastrointestinal disorders and is an integral part of ethnic Assamese cuisine. The ripe fruit, seldom consumed fresh or raw, is cut into thin slices, sun-dried for preservation as it is believed that the medicinal property of the fruit increases as it ages. With much traditional claims and beliefs regarding the medicinal properties of this plant, many therapeutic potentials of GP have been explored through research till now, including its antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anthelmintic, hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and nephroprotective properties. Moreover, the presence of polyphenols, flavonoids along with bioactive components like hydroxycitric acid, garcinol, and cambogin have also been reported from this plant, thereby increasing its research avenues. Even with the available knowledge, there is a huge lacking in the understanding of its underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the therapeutic properties, pharmacological mode of action, and its effect in different pathological conditions, along with detailed information about its chemical composition. This review mainly aims to summarise the potentially beneficial properties of GP that have already been reported, along with identifying the new avenues that still need to be addressed, thereby increasing the future prospect for in-depth research on this plant, along with its distribution and conservation status.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the protective effect of γ-mangostin, a component of the mangosteen shell, against oxidative damage to nerve cells induced by excessive glutamate, a known excitatory neurotransmitter. To investigate the effect of γ-mangostin on apoptosis, 5 mM of glutamate was used to induce apoptotic cell death in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. In this study, γ-mangostin was found to exert a stronger protection than N-acetyl cysteine against glutamate-induced cell damage. γ-Mangostin showed prevented glutamate-induced apoptosis in HT22 cells by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species and stimulating the expression of heme oxygenase-1 protein. In addition, glutamate significantly induced the accumulation of intracellular calcium ions, whereas treatment with γ-mangostin markedly reduced it. Hoechst 33342 staining showed an improvement in glutamate-induced nuclear condensation following γ-mangostin treatment. Furthermore, the number of annexin V-positive cells was significantly reduced following treatment with γ-mangostin. Western blot analysis showed the inhibition of glutamate-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation by γ-mangostin. γ-mangostin also inhibited the regulation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Thus, the results of this study suggest that γ-mangostin is an active ingredient of mangosteen and exerts neuroprotective activities in HT22 cells.",

      "abstract": "Garcinia species are widely used for their slimming effects via increased fat burning and suppression of satiety. However, scientific evidence for the biological effects of Garcinia atroviridis (GA) is lacking. We investigated the phytochemical composition, safety profiles, and antioxidant and antiobesity effects of methanolic extracts of Garcinia atroviridis (MeGa) in obese female rats. Repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted according to the OECD guidelines. Upon sacrifice, haematological, biochemical, lipid profile, and serum-based metabolomics analyses were performed to evaluate metabolic expression changes and their related pathways. MeGa contains several phytochemical groups and GA fruit acids. MeGa was found to be nontoxic in both male and female rats with an oral lethal dose (LD50) of 2000 mg/kg. After 9 weeks of treatment, MeGa-treated obese rats had lower weight gain and better lipid profiles (cholesterol and triglyceride), which correlated with the altered metabolic pathways involved in the metabolism of lipid (glycerophospholipid) and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid. In addition, MeGa caused differential metabolism pathways of arachidonic acid and tryptophan that affect the inflammatory response and suppression of appetite. We concluded that MeGa is safe, and its slimming effects are due to the differential metabolism of lipids."

The data revealed that GlS and GlL contained different levels of flavonoids and total phenol. Furthermore, the results showed the extracts exhibited remarkable antioxidation activities and inhibitory activities of α-amylase and α-glucosidase. In silico docking studies were done using Gold software and the probable molecules retrieved from PubChem were docked with several anti-diabetic relate targets, the results showed several components of G. linii could potentially inhibit diabetic molecules when compared with clinic drugs. The cell glucose uptake data also confirmed that GlL and GlS could retain the active component in the regulation of insulin, AMPK, PPARγ, and DPP4. In vivo, the evidence showed G. linii extracts including syringaldehyde suppressed effect of hyperglycemia on OSTT and OGTT assays. These results suggest that G. linii extract has a potential therapeutic value for the treatment of diabetes in humans.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Garcinia mangostana Linn. (\"mangosteen\") pericarp contains bioactive compounds that may target biological pathways implicated in schizophrenia. We conducted a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive mangosteen pericarp, compared to placebo, in the treatment of schizophrenia. METHODS: People diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), recruited across 2 sites (Brisbane and Victoria, Australia), were randomized to receive 24 weeks of adjunctive mangosteen pericarp (1,000 mg/day) or matched placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale total score. Secondary outcomes included positive and negative symptoms, general psychopathology, clinical global severity and improvement, participant reported overall improvement, depressive symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and safety data at 24 and 28 weeks (4 weeks postdiscontinuation). Data were collected from July 2016 to February 2019. RESULTS: Baseline assessments were conducted on 148 people (mangosteen = 74, placebo = 74); data analyses were conducted on 136 (92%) participants with postbaseline data. The treatment group had significantly higher symptom severity compared to placebo, and both groups significantly improved on all symptom, functioning, and quality of life measures over time. No between-group differences were found for the rate of change between baseline and 24 or 28 weeks. CONCLUSION: Despite promising preclinical and clinical work, our results do not support mangosteen pericarp extract as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in chemotherapy focus on target-specific mechanisms, which occur only in cancer cells and minimize the effects on normal cells. DNA damage and repair pathways are a promising target in the treatment of cancer. In order to identify novel compounds targeting DNA repair pathways, two key proteins, 53BP1 and RAD54L, were tagged with fluorescent proteins as indicators for two major double strand break (DSB) repair pathways: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). The engineered biosensor cells exhibited the same DNA repair properties as the wild type. The biosensor cells were further used to investigate the DNA repair activities of natural biological compounds. An extract from Phyllosticta sp., the endophyte isolated from the medicinal plant Garcinia cowa Roxb. ex Choisy, was tested. The results showed that the crude extract induced DSB, as demonstrated by the increase in the DNA DSB marker γH2AX. The damaged DNA appeared to be repaired through NHEJ, as the 53BP1 focus formation in the treated fraction was higher than in the control group. In conclusion, DNA repair-based biosensors are useful for the preliminary screening of crude extracts and biological compounds for the identification of potential targeted therapeutic drugs.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent, spontaneous, and transient seizures, and affects more than 70 million people worldwide. Although two dozen antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are approved and available in the market, seizures remain poorly controlled in one-third of epileptic patients who are suffering from drug resistance or various adverse effects. Recently, the xanthone skeleton has been regarded as an attractive scaffold for the discovery and development of emerging anticonvulsants. We had isolated several dihydroxanthone derivatives previously, including oliganthin H, oliganthin I, and oliganthin N, whose structures were similar and delicately elucidated by spectrum analysis or X-ray crystallographic data, from extracts of leaves of Garcinia oligantha. These xanthone analogues were evaluated for anticonvulsant activity, and a novel xanthone, oliganthin H, has been identified as a sound and effective natural inhibitor of convulsions in zebrafish in vivo. A preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis on the relationship between structures of the xanthone analogues and their activities was also conducted. Oliganthin H significantly suppressed convulsant behavior and reduced to about 25% and 50% of PTZ-induced activity, in 12.5 and 25 μM treatment groups (P < 0.01 and 0.001), respectively. Meanwhile, it reduced seizure activity, velocity, seizure duration, and number of bursts in zebrafish larvae (P < 0.05). Pretreatment of oliganthin H significantly restored aberrant induction of gene expressions including npas4a, c-fos, pyya, and bdnf, as well as gabra1, gad1, glsa, and glula, upon PTZ treatment. In addition, in silico analysis revealed the stability of the oliganthin H-GABAA receptor complex and their detailed binding pattern. Therefore, direct interactions with the GABAA receptor and involvement of downstream GABA-glutamate pathways were possible mechanisms of the anticonvulsant action of oliganthin H. Our findings present the anticonvulsant activity of oliganthin H, provide a novel scaffold for further modifications, and highlight the xanthone skeleton as an attractive and reliable resource for the development of emerging AEDs.",
