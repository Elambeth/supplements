      "abstract": "We herein present the case of a 73-year-old man with IgM multiple myeloma (IgM-MM) and t(11;14). The tumor cells showed a small lymphoplasmacytic morphology and dim expression of CD38 and CD138. The MYD 88L265P mutation was found to be negative. After plasma exchange, bortezomib and dexamethasone treatments were refractory. Subsequent daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone therapy failed to respond despite the standard therapy for non-IgM MM. Subsequently, pomalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone therapies demonstrated a good response, and a stringent complete response was therefore achieved. This case highlights the need for different treatment strategies for IgM-MM compared with non-IgM-MM because the biological features of IgM-MM and non-IgM-MM are different."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Daily image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) for prostate cancer reduces treatment-related toxicity. However, positional and anatomical variations can result in patient re-setup, increased treatment time, and additional imaging dose. A simple technique of two distinct imaging modalities was investigated: initially, an anteroposterior kilovoltage (AP-kV) planar image was acquired, followed by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). To determine whether this dual imaging modality (DIM) can reduce repeat CBCTs with an AP-kV screening image compared to CBCT alone, i.e. a single imaging modality (SIM). METHODS: Patients were enrolled sequentially before and after the new departmental protocol for IGRT. Initially, all patients had a CBCT prior to treatment (SIM group) as usual. For the DIM group, AP-kV imaging was added to the first three fractions, and subsequent AP-kV imaging (on demand) for patients unable to maintain adequate bladder and bowel compliance. Sixty intact prostate or post-prostatectomy patients were included: 30 before the change in protocol (SIM group) and 30 after (DIM group). Bladder volume, rectal filling, and positioning errors were evaluated. RESULTS: In the SIM group, 30 patients underwent a total of 1116 CBCTs. In the DIM group, 30 patients had 156 AP-kV images and 1077 CBCTs. In the SIM group, 166 were repeat CBCTs with a median of 4 repeat CBCTs per patient. In DIM group, 132 were repeat CBCTs with a median of 3 repeat CBCTs per patient. We found a significant difference in incidence of repeat CBCTs due to suboptimal bladder filling (p = 0.028) and rectal gas (p = 0.045), indicating the number of repeat CBCTs was significantly lower in patients imaged with DIM. CONCLUSION: The DIM technique was found to be superior to the SIM technique, as it allowed the desired bladder volume, rectal condition, and patient positioning to be achieved prior to CBCT, reducing the need for repeat CBCTs."

      "abstract": "The relation between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and circadian rhythm disturbance has been increasingly acknowledged in recent years. While prior clinical studies have utilized patients' self-reported sleep behaviors, there is a need to also explore the measurable, biological aspects of circadian rhythms. The current study has two aims: first, to describe the biological circadian rhythms of individuals with OCD seeking intensive residential treatment, including their relationship with self-reported measures of sleep and OCD symptoms; and second, to examine longitudinal associations between biological circadian rhythms and OCD symptom severity during the course of residential treatment. Adults receiving residential treatment for OCD (n = 23) completed a procedure to measure their dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) at admission, week two, week four, and discharge from treatment along with a battery of self-report assessments of OCD symptom severity and depression severity. Phase angle between DLMO and the midpoint of self-reported sleep was also calculated as a measure of the alignment between behavioral sleep-wake patterns and biological circadian rhythms at each time point. Cross-sectional correlations between these constructs were assessed and then cross-lagged panel models (CLPM) were fit to these data in order to examine the relation between 1) DLMO and OCD symptom severity across treatment and 2) phase angle of DLMO and midpoint of sleep and OCD symptom severity across treatment. Descriptive statistics indicate that sleep duration and timing were shifting closer toward general population averages across this period of treatment, perhaps due to newly supported bed and wake times in the treatment milieu. There were no significant cross-lagged paths between DLMO and OCD symptom severity during the first weeks of residential treatment. There was a significant cross-lagged path between DLMO phase angle from self-reported sleep midpoint and OCD symptom severity during the first weeks of residential treatment. Specifically, relatively shorter phase angle at admission was associated with less severe OCD symptoms at the second week of treatment; and relatively shorter phase angle at the second week of treatment was associated with more severe OCD symptoms at the fourth week of treatment. This study demonstrated the feasibility of measuring biological circadian rhythms in a residential treatment context and provided initial data demonstrating a longitudinal and dynamic relation between sleep, circadian rhythms, and OCD symptoms. Further study with larger samples is warranted. The non-linear pattern of relations across the course of this study also indicate that consideration of treatment processes and other factors not measured herein will strengthen future studies. Follow-up studies with residential treatment settings that continue salivary melatonin collection after treatment ends and patients return to their daily lives are also possible with this self-administered data collection procedure.",

Patients with choroidal nevi are frequently referred to ocular oncology centers to differentiate these from choroidal melanoma and to exclude a malignant transformation which rarely occurs. However, this causes a high workload for referral centers and may delay diagnosis and treatment of patients with potentially severe conditions. To overcome this, the MOLES score was previously developed which may empower non-specialists to differentiate choroidal nevi from melanoma. In this retrospective study, the performance of the MOLES score was assessed in 695 patients with choroidal nevi and 53 with choroidal melanoma. With a specificity of 96% (choroidal nevi) and a sensitivity of 100% (melanoma) the MOLES score was highly successful in differentiating choroidal nevi from melanoma and may offer great potential to optimize monitoring and referral decisions, and for teleophthalmology applications. Furthermore, the TFSOM-DIM score using risk factors for determining tumor progression was applied and showed a good correlation with MOLES. A complementary use of MOLES and TFSOM-DIM may be beneficial for clinical routine: MOLES for screening by non-experts with limited diagnostic tools and TFSOM-DIM in a referral setting to counsel also regarding potential transformation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Light is a key factor in moderating human alertness, both subjective and objective. However, the methodology applies in research on the effects of exposure to light of different wavelengths and intensities on objective and subjective alertness varies greatly and evidence on objective alertness in particular is still inconclusive. Thus, the present, highly standardized within-subject laboratory study on N = 44 healthy males explored how LED light of different intensities (dim vs. bright light) and wavelengths (red vs. blue) affected objective (reaction time/RT) as well as subjective (sleepiness) alertness in the morning after wake-up. METHODS: Participants spent two separate nights in the laboratory and were exposed to either one of the two light intensities or colors for 60 min after wake-up. Additionally, they indicated their sleepiness on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and participated in an auditory RT task before and after light intervention. It was hypothesized that both bright and blue light would lead to greater subjective and objective alertness when compared to dim and red light, respectively. RESULTS: Results indicated that average RTs were longer for participants in the bright light condition (p = 0.004, f2 = 0.07) and that RTs decreased post-light exposure irrespective of light being dim or bright (p = 0.026, f2 = 0.07). However, dim versus bright light and RT did not interact (p = 0.758, f2 = 0.07). Chronotype was a significant covariate in the interaction of dim versus bright light and subjective sleepiness (p = 0.008, f2 = 0.22). There was no difference in RTs when comparing exposure to red or blue light (p = 0.488, f2 = 0.01). Findings on subjective sleepiness and light of different wavelengths revealed that sleepiness was reduced after light exposure (p = 0.007, f2 = 0.06), although the wavelength of light did not appear to play a role in this effect (p = 0.817, f2 = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Hence, neither of the hypotheses could be confirmed. However, they indicated that evening types might benefit from exposure to bright light regarding sleepiness, but not morning types.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Research has provided novel insights into how light stimulates circadian rhythms through specialised retinal ganglion cells to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In addition, there has been a revolution in light-emitting diode (LED) technology, leading to tunable LED light sources and lighting systems, enabling 24-hour dynamic light scenarios with bright blue-enriched short wavelength light during the day and dim evening light, stimulating the circadian system. These dynamic LED lighting systems are now being implemented at hospitals without adequate understanding of how it may affect the health and well-being of patients and staff. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An optimised dynamic LED lighting scenario is investigated at a newly built psychiatric hospital in Copenhagen. In the 12 months baseline period, a standard lighting scenario with dynamic colour temperature and fixed light intensity is investigated. In the following 12-month intervention period, a new DEL scenario is investigated, having dynamic colour temperature as well as dynamic light intensity with a higher daytime and lower evening-time melanopic daylight equivalent illuminance. This setting is furthermore adjusted for geographical orientation to compensate for differences in sunlight access in wintertime. The study uses a quasiexperimental design comparing patients admitted in the two study periods. Prior to each of the study periods, daylight and the contribution from the LED-lighting scenarios was measured. Patient sociodemographic and mental health data will be retrieved retrospectively from electronic medical records and by questionnaires administered in the two periods, evaluating lighting, noise, sleep quality and quality of life. Primary outcome is the proportion of patients receiving pro re nata medications. Secondary outcomes are the length of stay, sleep onset latency, sleep quality and quality of life. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical issues are expected. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed international journal, lectures, posters and interviews.

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive form of primary brain tumor in adults, which unfortunately has an abysmal prognosis and poor survival rates. The reason behind the poor success rate of several FDA-approved drug is mainly attributed to insufficient drug distribution to the tumor site across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induction of resistance. In this study, we have developed a novel nanotherapeutic approach to achieve our goal. PLGA-based nanoencapsulation of both Temozolomide (TMZ) and EGFR inhibitor 3,3'-diindoyl methane (DIM) in a combinatorial approach enhances the delivery of them together. Their synergistic mode of actions, significantly enhances the cytotoxic effect of TMZ in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the dual-loaded nanoformulation works more efficiently on DNA damage and apoptosis, resulting in a several-fold reduction in tumor burden in vivo, systemic drug toxicity, and increased survival. These findings suggest the preclinical potential of this new treatment strategy.",

      "abstract": "Internal circadian phase assessment is increasingly acknowledged as a critical clinical tool for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders and for investigating circadian timing in other medical disorders. The widespread use of in-laboratory circadian phase assessments in routine practice has been limited, most likely because circadian phase assessment is not required by formal diagnostic nosologies, and is not generally covered by insurance. At-home assessment of salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO, a validated circadian phase marker) is an increasingly accepted approach to assess circadian phase. This approach may help meet the increased demand for assessments and has the advantages of lower cost and greater patient convenience. We reviewed the literature describing at-home salivary DLMO assessment methods and identified factors deemed to be important to successful implementation. Here, we provide specific protocol recommendations for conducting at-home salivary DLMO assessments to facilitate a standardized approach for clinical and research purposes. Key factors include control of lighting, sampling rate, and timing, and measures of patient compliance. We include findings from implementation of an optimization algorithm to determine the most efficient number and timing of samples in patients with Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder. We also provide recommendations for assay methods and interpretation. Providing definitive criteria for each factor, along with detailed instructions for protocol implementation, will enable more widespread adoption of at-home circadian phase assessments as a standardized clinical diagnostic, monitoring, and treatment tool.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Dim light at night contributes to neurodegenerative diseases by causing neuroinflammation. In the central nervous system, the activation of microglia is a significant contributor to neuroinflammation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find an intervention to treat the neuroinflammatory response caused by dim light at night. Melatonin is a rhythmic hormone whose synthesis is suppressed during the day. In this study, we attempt to explore whether and how melatonin improves hippocampal neuroinflammation in mice exposed to dim blue light at night. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo, a total of 36 male C57BL6/J mice that exposed to no light at night, dim blue light at night, and dim blue light at night with melatonin treatment. In vitro, the corticosterone-induced BV2 cells with or without melatonin treatment were used. RESULTS: Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed melatonin treatment significantly reduced dim blue light -induced hippocampal microglial activation and the expression of inflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α. This improved effect of melatonin is related to its receptor MT2 rather than MT1. The MT2 blockers significantly increased mRNA levels of M1-type activation marker CD86 and inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in melatonin-treated BV2 cells. Binding of melatonin to its receptor MT2 downregulated the expression of inflammatory proteins P-P65 and NLRP3, consequently inhibited the CD80 expression and M1-type activation in microglia. Furthermore, consistent with the decrease in microglial activation and inflammatory response after melatonin treatment, we also observed a reduction in hippocampal neuron loss and damage to the HT22 cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that melatonin may regulate microglial polarization through MT2/NF-kB-NLRP3 pathway and improves dim blue light -induced hippocampal neuroinflammation in mice."

This study investigated the dynamic changes of natural killer (NK) cells and follicular T helper (Tfh) cells and their associations in relapsing-remitting MS patients. The findings revealed inverse relationships between NK cells and CD4+ T cells or Tfh cells. Specifically, CD56dim NK cells, not CD56bright NK cells, were negatively correlated with CD4+ T cells and Tfh cells. However, no significant correlations were found between NK cells and sNfL levels or EDSS scores. The ratio of CD56dim NK cells to circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells demonstrated superior discriminatory ability in distinguishing relapsing MS patients from healthy controls (HCs) and remitting patients, as determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Following treatment with immunosuppressants or disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), a significant increase in the CD56dim NK/cTfh ratio was observed. These findings suggest that the CD56dim NK/cTfh ratio holds promise as a prognostic indicator for clinical relapse and treatment response in MS."

      "abstract": "Background: Insomnia is increasingly recognized for its marked impact on public health and is often associated with various adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular diseases and mental health disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of pre-sleep dim light therapy (LT) as a non-pharmacological intervention for insomnia in adults, assessing its influence on sleep parameters and circadian rhythms. Methods: A randomized, open-label, two-arm clinical trial was conducted over two weeks with 40 participants aged 20-60 years, all of whom had sleep disorders (CRIS, KCT0008501). They were allocated into control and LT groups. The LT group received exposure to warm-colored light, minimizing the blue spectrum, before bedtime. The study combined subjective evaluation via validated, sleep-related questionnaires, objective sleep assessments via actigraphy, and molecular analyses of circadian clock gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Baseline characteristics between the two groups were compared using an independent t-test for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. Within-group differences were assessed using the paired t-test. Changes between groups were analyzed using linear regression, adjusting for each baseline value and body mass index. The patterns of changes in sleep parameters were calculated using a linear mixed model. Results: The LT group exhibited significant improvements in sleep quality (difference in difference [95% CI]; -2.00 [-3.58, -0.43], and sleep efficiency (LT: 84.98 vs. control: 82.11, p = 0.032), and an advanced Dim Light Melatonin Onset compared to the control group (approximately 30 min). Molecular analysis indicated a significant reduction in CRY1 gene expression after LT, suggesting an influence on circadian signals for sleep regulation. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the efficacy of LT in improving sleep quality and circadian rhythm alignment in adults with insomnia. Despite limitations, such as a small sample size and short study duration, the results underscore the potential of LT as a viable non-pharmacological approach for insomnia. Future research should expand on these results with larger and more diverse cohorts followed over a longer period to validate and further elucidate the value of LT in sleep medicine. Trial registration: The trial was registered with the Clinical Research Information Service (KCT0008501).",

Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, being well known for their high brightness and quantum efficiencies, are the antithesis of PTAs. Nonetheless, a systematic exploration of the photophysics and photothermal characteristics of a series of π-extended BODIPY dyes with high absorptivity in the near-infrared (NIR) region has achieved superior photothermal conversion efficiencies (>90%), in both monomeric state and nanoparticles after encapsulation in a biocompatible polyethyleneglycol 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy-(polyethylene glycol)-2000]. Optimal PTA candidates combine strong NIR absorption provided by extended donor-acceptor conjugation and an optimization of the electronic and steric effects of meso-substituents to maximize photothermal conversion performance. The PTT-optimized meso-CF3-BODIPY, TCF3PEn exhibits exceptional efficacy in inducing cancer cell apoptosis and in vivo tumor ablation using low-power NIR laser irradiation (0.3 W cm-2, 808 nm) as well as excellent biological safety, underscoring its potential for advancing light-induced cancer therapies.",

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to preliminarily evaluate whether knowing the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) time is advantageous when treating delayed sleep-wake phase disorder with low-dose melatonin treatment plus behavioral interventions (ie, evening dim light and time in bed scheduling). METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, 40 adults with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of 0.5 mg timed to be administered either 3 hours before the DLMO (measured DLMO group, n = 20) or 5 hours before sleep-onset time per actigraphy (estimated DLMO group, n = 20), in conjunction with behavioral interventions. The primary outcome was change in the DLMO (measured in-home). Secondary outcomes included sleep parameters per diary and actigraphy (sleep-onset and -offset times and total sleep time), Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, PROMIS-Sleep Disturbance, PROMIS-Sleep Related Impairment, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Mixed-effects models tested for group differences in these outcome. RESULTS: After applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (significant P value set at < .004), there were significant main effects for visit on all outcomes except for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and total sleep time per wrist actigraphy and diary. There were no group-by-visit interactions for any of the outcomes (P > .004). CONCLUSIONS: Scheduled low-dose melatonin plus behavioral interventions may improve many circadian and sleep parameters regardless of whether melatonin administration is scheduled based on estimated or measured DLMO. A larger-scale trial is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.

      "abstract": "The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab reduces disability progression in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. CD20 is a prototypical B-cell marker; however, subpopulations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid also express low levels of CD20 (CD20dim). Therefore, direct targeting and depletion of these CD20dim T-cell subpopulations may contribute to the therapeutic effect of ocrelizumab. The aim of this observational cohort study was to compare CD20+ B-cell and CD20dim T-cell distributions between peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of ocrelizumab-treated or ocrelizumab-untreated people with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab treatment was associated with depletion of circulating B cells and CD20dim CD4+ and CD20dim CD8+ T cells (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0016 and P = 0.0008, respectively) but, in cerebrospinal fluid, only with lower proportions of B cells and CD20dim memory CD4+ T cells (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0043, respectively). The proportional prevalence of cerebrospinal fluid CD20dim memory CD8+ T cells was not significantly reduced (P = 0.1333). Only in cerebrospinal fluid, the proportions of CD20dim cells within CD4+ and not CD8+ T cells positive for CCR5, CCR6 and CXCR3 were reduced in ocrelizumab-treated participants. The proportion of CD20dim CD4+ T cells and abundance of CD4+ relative to CD8+ T cells in cerebrospinal fluid correlated positively with age (R = 0.6799, P = 0.0150) and Age-Related Multiple Sclerosis Severity score (R = 0.8087, P = 0.0014), respectively. We conclude that, in contrast to cerebrospinal fluid CD20dim CD8+ T cells, B cells and CD20dim CD4+ T cells are reduced in cerebrospinal fluid of people with primary progressive multiple sclerosis with an ocrelizumab-associated depletion of circulating B cells and CD20dim T cells. Therefore, these cells are likely to contribute to the therapeutic effects of ocrelizumab in people with primary progressive multiple sclerosis."

METHODS: A total of sixty-four newly treated SLE patients and sixteen healthy controls (HC) enrolled in the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University were selected as the research subjects. And the gene expression levels of molecules related to NK cell-killing function were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. CD56dimCD57+ NK cells were co-cultured with the K562 cells, and the apoptotic K562 cells were labeled with Annexin-Ⅴ and 7-amino-actinomycin D. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with 20, 40, and 80 μmol/L hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and treated without H2O2 as control, the expression level of perforin (PRF) was detected by flow cytometry. The concentration of IFN-α in serum was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of IFN-α receptors (IFNAR) on the surface of CD56dimCD57+ NK cells were detected by flow cytometry, and were represented by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). CD56dimCD57+ NK cells were treated with 1 000 U/mL IFN-α for 24, 48 and 72 h, and no IFN-α treatment was used as the control, the apoptosis and the expression levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) were measured by flow cytometry and represented by MFI. RESULTS: Compared with HC(n=3), the expression levels of PRF1 gene in peripheral blood NK cells of the SLE patients (n=3) were decreased (1.24±0.41 vs. 0.57±0.12, P=0.05). Compared with HC(n=5), the ability of peripheral blood CD56dimCD57+ NK cells in the SLE patients (n=5) to kill K562 cells was significantly decreased (58.61%±10.60% vs. 36.74%±6.27%, P < 0.01). Compared with the control (n=5, 97.51%±1.67%), different concentrations of H2O2 treatment significantly down-regulated the PRF expression levels of CD56dimCD57+ NK cells in a dose-dependent manner, the 20 μmol/L H2O2 PRF was 83.23%±8.48% (n=5, P < 0.05), the 40 μmol/L H2O2 PRF was 79.53%±8.56% (n=5, P < 0.01), the 80 μmol/L H2O2 PRF was 76.67%±7.16% (n=5, P < 0.01). Compared to HC (n=16), the serum IFN-α levels were significantly increased in the SLE patients (n=45) with moderate to high systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI≥10) [(55.07±50.36) ng/L vs. (328.2±276.3) ng/L, P < 0.001]. Meanwhile, compared with HC (n=6), IFNAR1 expression in peripheral blood CD56dimCD57+ NK cells of the SLE patients (n=6) were increased (MFI: 292.7±91.9 vs. 483.2±160.3, P < 0.05), and compared with HC (n=6), IFNAR2 expression in peripheral blood CD56dimCD57+ NK cells of the SLE patients (n=7) were increased (MFI: 643.5±113.7 vs. 919.0±246.9, P < 0.05). Compared with control (n=6), the stimulation of IFN-α (n=6) significantly promoted the apoptosis of CD56dimCD57+ NK cells (20.48%±7.01% vs. 37.82%±5.84%, P < 0.05). In addition, compared with the control (n=4, MFI: 1 049±174.5), stimulation of CD56dimCD57+ NK cells with IFN-α at different times significantly promoted the production of mtROS in a time-dependent manner, 48 h MFI was 3 437±1 472 (n=4, P < 0.05), 72 h MFI was 6 495±1 089 (n=4, P < 0.000 1), but there was no significant difference at 24 h of stimulation. CONCLUSION: High serum IFN-α level in SLE patients may induce apoptosis by promoting mtROS production and inhibit perforin expression, which can down-regulate CD56dimCD57+ NK killing function.",

However, TRPA1's role in the context of innate and adaptive immune responses has not been fully elucidated so far. In this study, we aimed at investigating the expression and function of TRPA1 channels on NK cells. Among NK cells, TRPA1 was highly expressed by the CD56dimCD16+ subpopulation, but not by CD56brightCD16- cells, as detected by FACS. TRPA1 activation with the potent ligand allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induces intracellular calcium flux in CD56dimCD16+ cells, which was prevented by the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031. AITC treatment increased the membrane around NKp44 and strongly decreased CD16 and CD8 expression, while CD158a, CD159a, NKG2d, NKp46 were substantially unaffected. Importantly, AITC increased the granzyme production and CD107 expression and increased NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity towards the K562 cell line and two different melanoma cell lines. In parallel, TRPA1 activation also plays regulatory roles by affecting the survival of NK cells to limit uncontrolled and prolonged NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that the activation of TRPA1 is an important regulatory signal for NK cells, and agonists of TRPA1 could be used to strengthen the tumor response of the immune system.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: HIV-associated neuroinflammation persists in the brain despite suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We evaluated associations between a subset of CD8 + T cells, termed CD4 dim CD8 bright T cells, and soluble markers of immune activation and/or neuroinflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of people with HIV (PWH). DESIGN: Fifteen cART-naive PWH were enrolled and underwent blood draw, lumbar puncture for CSF collection, and neuropsychological tests at week 0 (pre-cART) and 24 weeks after cART initiation. METHODS: CSF and peripheral blood T cells were evaluated with flow cytometry and soluble markers of immune activation were measured by multiplex and singleplex assays. Spearman bootstrap correlation coefficients with 10 000 resamples were computed and reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each marker of interest and T-cell type. RESULTS: The frequency of CSF CD4 dim CD8 bright T cells at week 0 was inversely related with CSF neopterin. In contrast, at week 24, CSF CD4 - CD8 + T cells were positively correlated with CSF s100β, a marker of brain injury. In the blood, at week 0, CD4 dim CD8 bright T cells were inversely correlated with MCP-1, IP-10, IL-8, IL-6, G-CSF, and APRIL and positively correlated with plasma RANTES and MMP1. At week 0, the frequency of blood CD4 - CD8 + were positively correlated with CRP and BAFF. CONCLUSION: CD4 dim CD8 bright T cells are associated with some anti-inflammatory properties, whereas CD4 - CD8 + T cells may contribute to inflammation and injury. Assessing the contrast between these two cell populations in neuroHIV may inform targeted therapeutic intervention to reduce neuroinflammation and associated neurocognitive impairment.",

The oral biofilm is a type of biofilm that has consequences for human health. It is a complex, three-dimensional structure that develops on the surface of teeth via the attachment of primary microbial colonizers. Many oral infections are caused by an imbalance occurring in the microorganisms naturally found in oral biofilms and are considered major public health concerns. In this study, we test the effect of a natural bis-indole, 3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM), in mitigating the pathogenicity of the oral biofilm inhabiting bacterium Streptococcus mutans, a bacterium that is considered to be a principal etiological agent in dental caries. Our study found that DIM was able to attenuate S. mutans biofilm formation by 92%. Additionally, treatment with DIM lowered extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production and decreased its durability significantly under acidic conditions. Therefore, the anti-biofilm and anti-virulence properties of DIM against S. mutans bacteria in an \"oral setting\" provides evidence for its usefulness in reducing biofilm formation and potentially for caries attenuation."

In this context, by considering the well-known involvement of the endocannabinoid system in prostate cancer, we have pharmacologically characterized the properties of DIM on both CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in two human prostate cancer cell lines: PC3 (androgen-independent/androgen receptor negative) and LNCaP (androgen-dependent). In the PC3 cell line, DIM was able to activate CB2 receptors and potentially associated apoptotic pathways. On the other hand, although DIM was also able to activate CB2 receptors in the LNCaP cell line, no apoptotic effects were observed. Our evidence confirms that DIM is a CB2 receptor ligand and, moreover, it has a potential anti-proliferative effect on androgen-independent/androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cells.",

The present study examines the potential for supplementation with Brussels sprouts (BS) or 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) to alter plasma levels of [14C]-BaP and metabolites over a 48-h period following micro-dosing with 50 ng (5.4 nCi) [14C]-BaP. Volunteers were dosed with [14C]-BaP following fourteen days on a cruciferous vegetable restricted diet, or the same diet supplemented for seven days with 50 g of BS or 300 mg of BR-DIM® prior to dosing. BS or DIM reduced total [14C] recovered from plasma by 56-67% relative to non-intervention. Dietary supplementation with DIM markedly increased Tmax and reduced Cmax for [14C]-BaP indicative of slower absorption. Both dietary treatments significantly reduced Cmax values of four downstream BaP metabolites, consistent with delaying BaP absorption. Dietary treatments also appeared to reduce the T1/2 and the plasma AUC(0,∞) for Unknown Metabolite C, indicating some effect in accelerating clearance of this metabolite. Toxicokinetic constants for other metabolites followed the pattern for [14C]-BaP (metabolite profiles remained relatively consistent) and non-compartmental analysis did not indicate other significant alterations. Significant amounts of metabolites in plasma were at the bay region of [14C]-BaP irrespective of treatment. Although the number of subjects and large interindividual variation are limitations of this study, it represents the first human trial showing dietary intervention altering toxicokinetics of a defined dose of a known human carcinogen.",

      "abstract": "HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), which is caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, usually arises in the context of uncontrolled HIV replication and immunosuppression. However, disease occasionally occurs in individuals with durable HIV viral suppression and CD4 T cell recovery under antiretroviral therapy (ART). The underlying mechanisms associated with this phenomenon are unclear. Suppression of viral infections can be mediated by CD8 T cells, which detect infected cells via their T cell receptor and the CD8 coreceptor. However, CD8 T cells exhibit signs of functional exhaustion in untreated HIV infection that may not be fully reversed under ART. To investigate whether KS under ART was associated with phenotypic and functional perturbations of CD8 T cells, we performed a cross-sectional study comparing HIV-infected individuals with persistent KS under effective ART (HIV+ KS+) to HIV-infected individuals receiving effective ART with no documented history of KS (HIV+ KSneg). A subset of T cells with low cell surface expression of CD8 (\"CD8dim T cells\") was expanded in HIV+ KS+ compared with HIV+ KSneg participants. Relative to CD8bright T cells, CD8dim T cells exhibited signs of senescence (CD57) and mitochondrial alterations (PGC-1α, MitoTracker) ex vivo. Mitochondrial activity (MitoTracker) was also reduced in proliferating CD8dim T cells. These findings indicate that an expanded CD8dim T cell population displaying features of senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with KS disease under ART. CD8 coreceptor down-modulation may be symptomatic of ongoing disease."

      "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the control of human viral infections but their activity is significantly impaired in patients infected with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The mechanism that contributes to NK cell dysfunction in CHB needs further elucidation. In this study, we analyzed the expression and function of the novel inhibitory receptor immunoglobulin-like transcript-2 (ILT2) on NK cells from 131 CHB patients and 36 healthy controls. We observed that ILT2 expression on circulating CD56dimCD16+NK cells was increased in immune-tolerant, immune-active and HBeAg-negative hepatitis patients compared with inactive carriers and controls. The frequency of ILT2+CD56dimNK cells was positively correlated with serum viral load in immune-tolerant patients. The percentage of ILT2+CD56dimNK cells decreased along with HBV load in CHB patients who received antiviral therapy. Functional analysis showed that ILT2+CD56dimNK cells in CHB patients had significantly reduced degranulation and IFN-γ production. Upregulation of ILT2 was associated with high levels of apoptosis in CD56dimCD16+NK cells from CHB patients. ILT2 blockade was shown to increase the cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production of CD56dimNK cells in some CHB patients. Finally, ILT2 was found to be moderately upregulated by TGF-β1, which was increased in immune-tolerant, immune-active and HBeAg-negative hepatitis patients. Our results show that chronic HBV infection increases the levels of the inhibitory receptor ILT2 on CD56dimNK cells and inhibits their functions, providing a new mechanism of NK-cell disability in CHB patients.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is among the top global health problems with antibacterial resistance currently representing the major threat both in terms of occurrence and complexity. One reason current treatments of bacterial diseases are ineffective is the occurrence of protective and resistant biofilm structures. Phytochemicals are currently being reviewed for newer anti-virulence agents. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the anti-virulence activity of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), a bioactive cruciferous phytochemical. Using a series of in vitro assays on major Gram-negative pathogens, including transcriptomic analysis, and in vivo porcine wound studies as well as in silico experiments, we show that DIM has anti-biofilm activity. Following DIM treatment, our findings show that biofilm formation of two of the most prioritized bacterial pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited respectively by 65% and 70%. Combining the antibiotic tobramycin with DIM enabled a high inhibition (94%) of P. aeruginosa biofilm. A DIM-based formulation, evaluated for its wound-healing efficacy on P. aeruginosa-infected wounds, showed a reduction in its bacterial bioburden, and wound size. RNA-seq was used to evaluate the molecular mechanism underlying the bacterial response to DIM. The gene expression profile encompassed shifts in virulence and biofilm-associated genes. A network regulation analysis showed the downregulation of 14 virulence-associated super-regulators. Quantitative real-time PCR verified and supported the transcriptomic results. Molecular docking and interaction profiling indicate that DIM can be accommodated in the autoinducer- or DNA-binding pockets of the virulence regulators making multiple non-covalent interactions with the key residues that are involved in ligand binding. DIM treatment prevented biofilm formation and destroyed existing biofilm without affecting microbial death rates. This study provides evidence for bacterial virulence attenuation by DIM."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 HIV-1-positive patients were enrolled. The CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets and CD56dim NK cells were detected by flow cytometry. The concentrations of cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Extraction, amplification, and viral load quantification of specimens were performed using the Roche Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 test. RESULTS: Compared with IR group, the total number of red blood cells (RBCs) and lymphocytes (LCs) in INR group was significantly reduced, and there was a significant positive correlation between the number of RBCs and that of LCs. The overall production rates of T cells-related cytokines were lower in INR group. However, the cell-surface expression of programmed death-1 (PD-1) on CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were markedly elevated in INR group. Moreover, it was found that the proportion and the killing ability of CD56dim NK cells significantly increased in INR patients, and significantly correlated with apoptosis of T lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: A poor immune reconstitution in HIV-positive patients might result from multiple factors, including bone marrow suppression, high PD-1 expression on the surface of CD4+ T cells, and over-activation of T and NK cells. Besides, the activity of NK cells and RBCs count might be important auxiliary indicators for immune reconstitution and provided a reliable guidance for developing strategies to improve immune reconstitution."

Nevertheless, data regarding the role of subpopulations of monocytes in the CLL microenvironment are still limited. For the very first time, this study presents an assessment of monocyte subsets divided according to SLAN and CD16 expression in CLL patients. The study involved 70 freshly diagnosed CLL patients and 35 healthy donors. Using flow cytometry, monocyte subpopulations were assessed among PBMCs. CD14+ monocytes can be divided into: \"classical\" (CD14+CD16-SLAN-), \"intermediate\" (CD14+CD16+SLAN-) and \"non-classical\" (CD14dimCD16+SLAN+). In our study, we noted an increased percentage of non-classical monocytes with intracellular expression of TNF and IL-12. On the other hand, among the intermediate monocytes, a significantly higher percentage of cells synthesizing anti-inflammatory IL-10 was detected. The percentage of CD14dimCD16+SLAN+ monocytes producing TNF and IL-12 decreased with the stage of CLL and inversely correlated with the expression of the prognostic factors ZAP-70 and CD38. Moreover, the percentage of CD14dimCD16+SLAN+ monocytes producing TNF and IL-12 was lower in CLL patients requiring treatment. This may indicate the beneficial effect of non-classical monocytes on the anti-tumor response.",

      "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells protect against intracellular infection and cancer. These properties are exploited in oncolytic virus (OV) therapy, where antiviral responses enhance anti-tumour immunity. We have analysed the mechanism by which reovirus, an oncolytic dsRNA virus, modulates human NK cell activity. Reovirus activates NK cells in a type I interferon (IFN-I) dependent manner, inducing STAT1 and STAT4 signalling in both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cell subsets. Gene expression profiling revealed the dominance of IFN-I responses and identified induction of genes associated with NK cell cytotoxicity and cell cycle progression, with distinct responses in the CD56dim and CD56bright subsets. However, reovirus treatment inhibited IL-15 induced NK cell proliferation in an IFN-I dependent manner and was associated with reduced AKT signalling. In vivo, human CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells responded with similar kinetics to reovirus treatment, but CD56bright NK cells were transiently lost from the peripheral circulation at the peak of the IFN-I response, suggestive of their redistribution to secondary lymphoid tissue. Coupled with the direct, OV-mediated killing of tumour cells, the activation of both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells by antiviral pathways induces a spectrum of activity that includes the NK cell-mediated killing of tumour cells and modulation of adaptive responses via the trafficking of IFN-γ expressing CD56bright NK cells to lymph nodes.",

      "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In our modern society, artificial light is available around the clock and most people expose themselves to electrical light and light-emissive screens during the dark period of the natural light/dark cycle. Such suboptimal lighting conditions have been associated with adverse metabolic effects, and redesigning indoor lighting conditions to mimic the natural light/dark cycle more closely holds promise to improve metabolic health. Our objective was to compare metabolic responses to lighting conditions that resemble the natural light/dark cycle in contrast to suboptimal lighting in individuals at risk of developing metabolic diseases. METHODS: Therefore, we here performed a non-blinded, randomised, controlled, crossover trial in which overweight insulin-resistant volunteers (n = 14) were exposed to two 40 h laboratory sessions with different 24 h lighting protocols while staying in a metabolic chamber under real-life conditions. In the Bright day-Dim evening condition, volunteers were exposed to electric bright light (~1250 lx) during the daytime (08:00-18:00 h) and to dim light (~5 lx) during the evening (18:00-23:00 h). Vice versa, in the Dim day-Bright evening condition, volunteers were exposed to dim light during the daytime and bright light during the evening. Randomisation and allocation to light conditions were carried out by sequential numbering. During both lighting protocols, we performed 24 h indirect calorimetry, and continuous core body and skin temperature measurements, and took frequent blood samples. The primary outcome was plasma glucose focusing on the pre- and postprandial periods of the intervention. RESULTS: Spending the day in bright light resulted in a greater increase in postprandial triacylglycerol levels following breakfast, but lower glucose levels preceding the dinner meal at 18:00 h, compared with dim light (5.0 ± 0.2 vs 5.2 ± 0.2 mmol/l, n = 13, p=0.02). Dim day-Bright evening reduced the increase in postprandial glucose after dinner compared with Bright day-Dim evening (incremental AUC: 307 ± 55 vs 394 ± 66 mmol/l × min, n = 13, p=0.009). After the Bright day-Dim evening condition the sleeping metabolic rate was identical compared with the baseline night, whereas it dropped after Dim day-Bright evening. Melatonin secretion in the evening was strongly suppressed for Dim day-Bright evening but not for Bright day-Dim evening. Distal skin temperature for Bright day-Dim evening was lower at 18:00 h (28.8 ± 0.3°C vs 29.9 ± 0.4°C, n = 13, p=0.039) and higher at 23:00 h compared with Dim day-Bright evening (30.1 ± 0.3°C vs 28.8 ± 0.3°C, n = 13, p=0.006). Fasting and postprandial plasma insulin levels and the respiratory exchange ratio were not different between the two lighting protocols at any time. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Together, these findings suggest that the indoor light environment modulates postprandial substrate handling, energy expenditure and thermoregulation of insulin-resistant volunteers in a time-of-day-dependent manner.

Over 2 decades, several generations of Hsp90 ATP binding inhibitors have entered numerous cancer clinical trials, but few have advanced to FDA approval for treatment of human cancers. Herein, we report that Hsp90 expression varies dramatically, especially among different types of noncancer cells and organs. The highly variable levels of Hsp90, from as low as 1.7% to as high as 9% of their total cellular proteins, were responsible for either an extreme sensitivity or an extreme resistance to a classical Hsp90 ATP-binding inhibitor. Among randomly selected cancer cell lines, the same client proteins for regulation of cell growth exhibited unexpectedly heterogenous reactions in response to an Hsp90 ATP-binding inhibitor, inconsistent with the current understanding. Finally, a minimum amount (<10%) of Hsp90β was still required for client protein stability and cell survival even in the presence of full Hsp90α. These new findings of Hsp90 expression in host and isoform compensation in tumor cells could complicate biomarker selection, toxicity readout, and clinical efficacy of Hsp90-ATP-binding inhibitors in cancer clinical trials.",

Although natural killer (NK) cells exhibit anti-viral and anti-tumoral functions, virtually nothing is known about quantitative and qualitative differences in NK cells in patients with EBV+ cHL vs. EBV- cHL. Here, we prospectively investigated 36 cHL patients without known immune suppression or overt immunodeficiency at diagnosis. All 10 EBV+ cHL patients and 25 out 26 EBV- cHL were seropositive for EBV antibodies, and EBV+ cHL patients presented with higher plasma EBV DNA levels compared to EBV- cHL patients. We show that the CD56dim CD16+ NK cell subset was decreased in frequency in EBV+ cHL patients compared to EBV- cHL patients. This quantitative deficiency translates into an impaired CD56dim NK cell mediated degranulation toward rituximab-coated HLA class 1 negative lymphoblastoid cells in EBV+ compared to EBV- cHL patients. We finally observed a trend to a decrease in the rituximab-associated degranulation and ADCC of in vitro expanded NK cells of EBV+ cHL compared to healthy controls. Our findings may impact on the design of adjunctive treatment targeting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in EBV+ cHL.",

      "abstract": "Insects are behaviorally and physiologically affected by different light conditions, including photoperiod, light intensity, and spectrum. Light at night has important influences on nocturnal insects, including most moth species. Moth copulation and mating usually occur at night. Although a few studies examine changes in insect mating under artificial light at night, detailed influences of light, such as that of monochromatic light, on moth mating remain largely unknown. In this study, on the basis of long-term insects rearing experience, dim red light (spectrum range: 610-710nm, with a peak at 660nm; 2.0 Lux) during scotophase was hypothesized to enhance mating in the yellow peach moth, Conogethes punctiferalis. To test the hypothesis, the mating of moths under dim red, blue, and white lights during scotophase was observed. Under the dim red light, the enhancement of mating in C. punctiferalis was observed. In addition, the electroantennografic response of males against the female sex pheromone increased with red light treatment during scotophase. In an analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the antennae of males under red light and dark conditions, the expression levels of two odorant-binding protein (OBP) genes, CpunOBP2 and CpunPBP5, were up-regulated. Two genes were then expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins showed strong binding to female pheromone components in fluorescence-binding assays. Thus, the results of this study indicated that dim red light at night enhanced the mating of C. punctiferalis. One of the mechanisms for the enhancement was probably an increase in the antennal sensitivity of males to the female sex pheromone under red light that was caused by increases in the expression levels of pheromone-binding protein genes in male antennae."

      "abstract": "Circadian adaptation to night work usually does not occur in naturalistic conditions, largely due to exposure to low levels of light during the night and light in the morning on the way home. This leads to circadian misalignment, which has documented deleterious effects on sleep and functioning during waking hours. Chronic circadian misalignment is also being increasingly associated with long-term health comorbidities. As the circadian system is mostly sensitive to short wavelengths (i.e., blue light) and less sensitive to long wavelengths (i.e., red light), shaping light exposure in a \"wavelength-wise\" manner has been proposed to promote partial adaptation to night shifts, and, therefore, alleviate circadian rhythms disruption. This report presents results from two cross-over designed studies that aimed to investigate the effects of three different light conditions on circadian phase, sleepiness, and alertness of police patrol officers on a rotating shift schedule. The first study took place during summer (n = 15) and the second study (n = 25) during winter/early spring. In both studies, all participants went through three conditions composed of four consecutive night shifts: 1) in-car dim blue light exposure during the night shift and wearing of blue-blocking glasses (BBG) in the morning after 05:00 h; 2) in-car red light exposure during the night shift and wearing of BBG in the morning after 05:00 h; 3) a control condition with no intervention. To assess circadian phase position, salivary melatonin was collected hourly the night before and the night after each condition. Sleep was monitored by wrist actigraphy. Also, a 10-min Psychomotor Vigilance-Task was administered at the beginning and end of each night shift and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale was completed every 2 h during each night shift. In the summer study, no difference was found in alertness and sleepiness between conditions. Participants though exhibited greater (≈3 h) phase delay after four consecutive night shifts in the control condition (in which morning light exposure was expected to prevent phase delay) than after the blue and red conditions (≈2 h) (in which wearing BBG were expected to promote phase delay). In the second study performed during the winter/early spring, a comparable ≈2 h phase delay was found in each of the three conditions, with no difference in alertness and sleepiness between conditions. In conclusion, participants in both studies exhibited modest phase delay across the four night shifts, even during the control conditions. Still, re-entrainment was not fast enough to produce partial circadian adaptation after four night shifts. A greater number of consecutive night shifts may be necessary to produce enough circadian alignment to elicit benefits on sleepiness and alertness in workers driving a motorized vehicle during night shifts. In-car dim blue light exposure combined with the wearing of BBG in the morning did not show the expected benefits on circadian adaptation, sleepiness, and alertness in our studies. Higher levels of light may be warranted when implementing light intervention in a motorized vehicle setting.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, identification of immunosuppressive polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) that were traditionally described as proinflammatory cells emerged in the field of posttraumatic immunity. To understand their local and remote distribution after trauma, PMNL-subsets and the impact of immunomodulatory Club Cell protein (CC)16 that correlates with pulmonary complications were assessed. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice were divided into three groups, receiving isolated blunt chest trauma (TxT), undergoing TxT followed by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP, TxT + CLP) after 24 h, or sham undergoing analgosedation (n = 18/group). Further, each group was subdivided into three groups receiving either no treatment (ctrl) or intratracheal neutralization of CC16 by application of anti-CC16-antibody or application of an unspecific IgG control antibody (n = 6/group). Treatment was set at the time point after TxT. Analyses followed 6 h post-CLP. PMNL were characterized via expression of CD11b, CD16, CD45, CD62L, and Ly6G by flow cytometry in bone marrow (BM), blood, spleen, lung, liver, and bronchoalveolar and peritoneal lavage fluid (BALF and PL). Apoptosis was assessed by activated (cleaved) caspase-3. Results from untreated ctrl and IgG-treated mice were statistically comparable between all corresponding sham, TxT, and TxT + CLP groups. RESULTS: Immature (CD16dimCD62Lbright) PMNL increased significantly in BM, circulation, and spleen after TxT vs. sham and were significantly attenuated in the lungs, BALF, PL, and liver. Classical-shaped (CD16brightCD62Lbright) PMNL increased after TxT vs. sham in peripheral tissue and were significantly attenuated in circulation, proposing a trauma-induced migration of mature or peripheral differentiation of circulating immature PMNL. Immunosuppressive (CD16brightCD62Ldim) PMNL decreased significantly in the lungs and spleen, while they systemically increased after TxT vs. sham. CLP in the TxT + CLP group reduced immunosuppressive PMNL in PL and increased their circulatory rate vs. isolated TxT, showing local reduction in affected tissue and their increase in nonaffected tissue. CC16 neutralization enhanced the fraction of immunosuppressive PMNL following TxT vs. sham and decreased caspase-3 in the lungs post-CLP in the TxT + CLP group, while apoptotic cells in the liver diminished post-TxT. Posttraumatic CC16 neutralization promotes the subset of immunosuppressive PMNL and antagonizes their posttraumatic distribution. CONCLUSION: Since CC16 affects both the distribution of PMNL subsets and apoptosis in tissues after trauma, it may constitute as a novel target to beneficially shape the posttraumatic tissue microenvironment and homeostasis to improving outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Despite technological advances in cancer treatment, the survival rate of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) has not improved significantly. Many studies have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related signals are associated with mitochondrial damage and that these signals determine whether cells maintain homeostasis or activate cell death programs. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is regulated by ER membrane proteins such as double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase R(PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), which directly activate transcription of chaperones or genes that function in redox homeostasis, protein secretion, or cell death programs. In this study, we focused on the role of mitophagy and ER stress-mediated cell death induced by DIM-C-pPhtBu in HNC cancer. We found that DIM-C-pPhtBu, a compound that activates ER stress in many cancers, induced lysosomal dysfunction, excessive mitophagy, and cell death in HNC cells. Moreover, DIM-C-pPhtBu strongly inhibited HNC progression in a xenograft model by altering mitophagy related protein expression. Taken together, the results demonstrate that DIM-C-pPhtBu induces excessive mitophagy and eventually UPR-mediated cell death in HNC cells, suggesting that new anti-cancer drugs could be developed based on the connection between mitophagy and cancer cell death.",

Recently, the formation of a pre-metastatic niche has been considered a key factor contributing to breast cancer metastasis, which might also explain the tendency of organ metastasis. Our study initially re-examined the critical time of the niche formation and simultaneously detected a novel subset of neutrophils, CD62Ldim neutrophils, which had not previously been reported in tumor metastasis; the number of these cells progressively increased during breast cancer progression and was closely related to the formation of the pre-metastatic niche. Furthermore, we explored the mechanism of their aggregation in the pre-metastatic niche in the lung and found that they were specifically chemoattracted by the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling pathway. Compared to the CD62Lhi neutrophils, CD62Ldim neutrophils exhibited stronger adhesion and increased survival. The results provide new insights into the subsequent targeted treatment of breast cancer metastasis."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potency of the indole, 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), on the stability and suppressive function of Tregs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Furthermore, we used the AhR antagonist CH223191 to verify that DIM exerts its effects on Tregs through the activation of AhR. We found that DIM treatment significantly alleviated the severity of EAE by maintaining the stability and suppressive function of Tregs instead of facilitating the differentiation of Tregs. Thus, these DIM-treated Tregs might indirectly inhibit the generation of Th17 cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. And we confirmed the critical role of AhR in the EAE model. Our study further investigated the mechanisms by which dietary indoles promote Treg activity in the EAE model. DIM may act as a novel therapeutic to restrain autoimmune inflammation in multiple sclerosis.",

We observed that High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) was highly expressed in human TNBC and positively correlated with cancer metastasis. The hypoxic tumor environment is known to regulate HMGB1 secretion, but an understanding of the underlying mechanism by which tumor-derived HMGB1 regulates interstitial components and promotes breast cancer lung metastasis has remained elusive. The results of the present study showed that the number of CD62Ldim neutrophils, which have a strong ability to produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), increased significantly in both peripheral blood and lung tissues in a mouse TNBC model and were regulated by tumor-derived HMGB1 through the TLR2 pathway. Furthermore, serum HMGB1 levels were positively correlated with CD62Ldim neutrophils in 86 breast cancer patients. We demonstrated that CD62Ldim neutrophils accelerated lung metastasis and that interventions targeting the \"HMGB1-CD62Ldim neutrophil-NETs\" axis could inhibit lung metastasis. Our results suggest that the combination of HMGB1 and CD62Ldim neutrophils is a potential marker for breast cancer lung metastasis and is novel target for future prevention and therapy."

The bioassay results correlated with the dose-dependent up-regulation of HSP family proteins, pro-apoptotic proteins, ubiquitination protein, and the dose-dependent down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and developmental genes. Unexpectedly, genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and protein synthesis were up-regulated in response to DIM treatment, but, in general, the effects of DIM on B. neritina larvae were comparable to that reported in human cancer cell lines. DIM also induced changes in steroid hormone biosynthesis genes in B. neritina larvae, leading to the concern that DIM might have long-term effects on marine lives. Overall, the present study suggested that application of DIM to the bryozoan larvae would trigger a major transcriptomic response, which might be linked to the observed larval mortality and abnormality. We suggest that application of DIM as an antifouling ingredient should be proceeded with great cautions.",

      "abstract": "Women who carry the BRCA mutation are at high lifetime risk of breast cancer, but there is no consensus regarding an effective and safe chemoprevention strategy. A large body of evidence suggests that 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM), a dimer of indole-3-carbinol found in cruciferous vegetables, can potentially prevent carcinogenesis and tumor development. The primary aim of this prospective single-arm study was to investigate the effect of DIM supplementation on breast density, a recognized predictive factor of breast cancer risk. Participants were 23 healthy female BRCA carriers (median age 47 years; 78% postmenopausal) who were treated with oral DIM 100 mg × 1/day for 1 year. The amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT) and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed before and after the intervention was scored by two independent expert radiologists using the Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System. The results showed a decrease in the average score for FGT amount from 2.8 ± 0.8 at the onset to 2.65 ± 0.84 after 1 year (P = 0.031), with no significant change in BPE (P = 0.429). A group of DIM-untreated age- and menopausal-status-matched women from the BRCA clinic did not show a significant change in FGT amount (P = 0.33) or BPE (P = 0.814) in a parallel year. Mean estradiol level decreased from 159 to 102 pmol/l (P = 0.01), and mean testosterone level decreased from 0.42 to 0.31 pmol/l (P = 0.007). Side effects were grade 1. In conclusion, 1 year's supplementation with DIM 100 mg × 1/day in BRCA carriers was associated with a significant decline in FGT amount on MRI. Larger randomized studies are warranted to corroborate these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Other than the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) value, oncologists have only the clinical characteristics of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) to determine candidates for immunotherapy. A clinical prognostic score composed of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, sex, histologic type, stage, platinum-based first-line therapy, and response to first-line therapy has categorized 3 prognostic groups for patients undergoing second-line chemotherapy. We sought to validate the same score for patients with aNSCLC treated with second- or further-line immunotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data from 2 Italian centers. A score was generated to divide patients into 3 prognostic groups: best, score < 5; intermediate, score 5 to 9; and worst, score > 9. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were the endpoints. RESULTS: A total of 347 patients were included for analysis. Their median age was 66 years (range, 30-88 years), most were aged < 70 years (67.5%), 70.7% were men, 79.5% were smokers, and 74.6% had had adenocarcinoma. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 for 23%, 1 for 54.5%, and 2 for 22.5%. Of the 347 patients, 28% were in the best prognosis, 51% in the intermediate, and 21% in the worst prognosis group, respectively. The median OS was 18.0 months for the best, 8.5 months for the intermediate (hazard ratio [HR] vs. best, 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-2.47; P < .001) and 2.6 months for worst (HR vs. best, 5.77; 95% CI, 3.99-8.33; P < .001) group. The median PFS was 3.4 months for the best, 3.7 months for the intermediate (HR vs. best, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77; P = .032), and 1.9 months for the worst (HR vs. best, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.80-3.50; P < .001) group. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic score was able to predict the outcomes of patients with aNSCLC who had received immunotherapy. The worst category showed a dismal life expectancy and probably would not benefit from active systemic therapy. Thus, for these patients, best supportive care could be the best choice.",

      "abstract": "3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM), a metabolic product of indole-3-carbinol extracted from cruciferous vegetables exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Earlier, the product has been demonstrated to possess anti-fibrotic properties; however, its protective effects on liver injury have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we postulated the effects and molecular mechanisms of action of DIM on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury in mice. Acute liver injury was induced by a single intraperitoneal administration of CCl4 (1 ml/kg) into mice. DIM was injected via subcutaneous route for three days at various doses (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) before CCl4 injection. Mice were sacrificed and serum was collected for quantification of serum transaminases. The liver was collected and weighed. Treatment with DIM significantly reduced serum transaminases levels (AST and ALT), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). CCl4- induced apoptosis was inhibited by DIM treatment by the reduction in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl2 associated X protein (Bax). DIM treated mice significantly restored Cytochrome P450 2E1, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in CCl4 treated mice. In addition, DIM downregulated overexpression of hepatic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inhibited CCl4 mediated apoptosis. Our results suggest that the protective effects of DIM against CCl4- induced liver injury are due to the inhibition of ROS, reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators and apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Despite an elevated recovery need, research indicates that athletes often exhibit relatively poor sleep. Timing and consolidation of sleep is driven by the circadian system, which requires periodic light-dark exposure for stable entrainment to the 24-hour day, but is often disturbed due to underexposure to light in the morning (e.g. low-level indoor lighting) and overexposure to light in the evening (e.g. environmental and screen-light). This study examined whether combining fixed sleep schedules with light regulation leads to more consolidated sleep. Morning light exposure was increased using light-emitting goggles, whereas evening light exposure was reduced using amber-lens glasses. Using a within-subject crossover design, twenty-six athletes (14 female, 12 male) were randomly assigned to start the intervention with the light-regulation-week or the no light-regulation-week. Sleep was monitored by means of sleep diaries and actigraphy. Due to low protocol adherence regarding the fixed sleep-wake schedules, two datasets were constructed; one including athletes who kept a strict sleep-wake schedule (N = 8), and one that also included athletes with a more lenient sleep-wake schedule (N = 25). In case of a lenient sleep-wake schedule, light regulation improved self-reported sleep onset latency (Δ SOL = 8 min). This effect was stronger (Δ SOL = 17 min) and complemented by enhanced subjective sleep quality in case of a strict sleep-wake schedule. None of the actigraphy-based estimates differed significantly between conditions. To conclude, light regulation may be considered a potentially effective strategy to improve subjective sleep, but less obtrusive methods should be explored to increase protocol compliance.",

      "abstract": "Recently, we found that temozolomide (TMZ) can upregulate the expression of the multidrug-resistance protein ABCC3 in NK cells from both glioma-bearing mice and glioblastoma patients treated with dendritic cell immunotherapy combined with TMZ, allowing NK cells to escape apoptosis and favoring their role as antitumor effector cells. Here, we demonstrate that CD56dim NK cells expressing CD16+ are predominant in patients surviving more than 12 months after surgery without disease progression. CD56dim CD16+ NK cells co-expressed high levels of ABCC3 and IFN-. Notably, not only basal but also TMZ-induced ABCC3 expression was related to a strong, long-term NK cell response and a better prognosis of patients. The identification of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs35467079 with the deletion of a cytosine (-897DelC) in the promoter region of the ABCC3 gene resulted associated with a better patient outcome. ABCC3 expression in patients carrying DelC compared to patients with reference haplotype was higher and modulated by TMZ. The transcription factor NRF2, involved in ABCC3 induction, was phosphorylated in CD56dim CD16+ NK cells expressing ABCC3 under TMZ treatment. Thus, ABCC3 protein and the SNP -897DelC can play a predictive role in patients affected by GBM, and possibly other cancers, treated with dendritic cell immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy.",

However, the impact of pretreatment variables, such as CD19 expression level, on leukemic blasts, the presence of CD19- subpopulations, and especially prior CD19-targeted therapy, on the response to CAR T-cell therapy has not been determined. We analyzed 166 patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy at our institution. Eleven patients did not achieve a minimal residual disease (MRD)- deep remission, whereas 67 patients had a recurrence after achieving a MRD- deep remission: 28 patients with CD19+ leukemia and 39 patients with CD19- leukemia. Return of CD19+ leukemia was associated with loss of CAR T-cell function, whereas CD19- leukemia was associated with continued CAR T-cell function. There were no significant differences in efficacy of CAR T cells in CD19-dim B-ALL, compared with CD19-normal or -bright B-ALL. Consistent with this, CAR T cells recognized and lysed cells with very low levels of CD19 expression in vitro. The presence of dim CD19 or rare CD19- events by flow cytometry did not predict nonresponse or recurrence after CAR T-cell therapy. However, prior therapy with the CD19-directed, bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab was associated with a significantly higher rate of failure to achieve MRD- remission or subsequent loss of remission with antigen escape. Finally, immunophenotypic heterogeneity and lineage plasticity were independent of underlying clonotype and cytogenetic abnormalities.",

We studied the functional properties of NK cells (including CD56dim NK and CD56bright NK cells) in patients with HBV-related decompensated liver cirrhosis (HBV-DLC) and analyzed their relationship with decompensation of liver function. Thirty patients with HBV-DLC and 25 patients with HBV-related compensated liver cirrhosis (HBV-CLC) were recruited in this study. Twenty five age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were recruited as healthy controls (HCs). The phenotypical and functional characteristics of NK cell subsets were detected by flow cytometry, and the correlation between NK cells and decompensation of liver function was analyzed. The frequency of circulating CD56bright NK cells was significantly increased while circulating CD56dim NK cells was significantly decreased in HBV-DLC patients as compared with HCs and HBV-CLC patients. Peripheral activated-CD56bright NK cells from HBV-DLC patients might express lower levels of inhibitory receptor CD158b1/2 and higher levels of activating receptor NKG2D and their expression of perforin and granzyme A/B also increased significantly compared with HCs, suggesting a high immune activation status of peripheral CD56bright NK cells in HBV-DLC patients. In HBV-DLC patients, the expression of CD107a and perforin in circulating CD56dim NK cells was positively correlated with cytolytic capacity while CD107a and perforin expression in circulating CD56dim NK cells were significantly decreased, suggesting an impaired cytolytic capacity of circulating CD56dim NK cells. Besides, we found that the perforin expression of circulating CD56dim NK cells correlated negatively with child-pugh classification in HBV-DLC patients. The functional properties of circulating NK cell subsets in HBV-DLC patients have changed significantly, especially of CD56dim NK cells which closely related to decompensation of liver function. These findings may help provide new perspectives and theoretical basis for the treatment of patients with HBV-DLC.",

METHODS: Flow cytometry data were reanalyzed to compare plasma cell percentages between the standard panel and VS38 panel. Natural killer (NK) and plasma cell CD38 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were calculated. RESULTS: Our cohort included 63 specimens from 38 patients. Twenty-six had received daratumumab (monoclonal anti-CD38 therapy) between less than 1 month and 17 months prior. For NK and plasma cells, CD38 MFI values were suppressed for 0 to 4 months and started to increase 4 to 6 months after last exposure. There was no significant difference in clonal plasma cell percentage calculated by the VS38 and standard panels; however, identification and quantification using the VS38 panel were easier. CONCLUSIONS: VS38 is a viable alternative to bright CD38 to identify plasma cells and particularly helpful in myeloma cases with dim CD38 and after daratumumab. Daratumumab interference with CD38 identification persists 4 to 6 months after the last exposure.",

Therefore, it is imperative to search for compounds, which can effectively inhibit the abnormal activation of RA-FLSs, and retard RA progression.3'3-Diindolylmethane (DIM), the major product of the acid-catalyzed oligomerization of indole-3-carbinol from cruciferous vegetables, has been reported to be functionally relevant to inhibition of migration, invasion and carcinogenesis in some solid tumors. In this study, we explored the anti-proliferation, anti-metastasis and anti-inflammation effects of DIM on RA-FLSs as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. To do this, primary RA-FLSs were isolated from RA patients and an animal model. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were measured using CCK-8, scratch, and Transwell assays, respectively. The effects of DIM on Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and some inflammatory factors mRNA and key molecules such as some inflammatory factors and those involved in aberrantly-activated signaling pathway in response to tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α), a typical characteristic mediator in RA-FLS, were quantitatively measured by real-time PCR and western blotting. Moreover, the effect of DIM on adjuvant induced arthritis(AIA) models was evaluated with C57BL/6 mice in vivo. The results showed that DIM inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of RA-FLS in vitro. Meanwhile, DIM dramatically suppressed TNF-α-induced increases in the mRNA levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-9; as well as the proinflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β. Mechanistic studies revealed that DIM is able to suppress phosphorylated activation not only of p38, JNK in MAPK pathway but of AKT, mTOR and downstream molecules in the AKT/mTOR pathway. Moreover, DIM treatment decreased expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and alleviated arthritis severity in the knee joints of AIA mice. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that DIM could inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of RA-FLSs and reduce proinflammatory factors induced by TNF-α in vitro by blocking MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathway and prevent inflammation and knee joint destruction in vivo, which suggests that DIM might have therapeutic potential for RA.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of CD45dimCD117+ phenotype-abnormal cells (hereinafter referred to as \"abnormal cells\") for relapse and prognosis in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) within 2 weeks after the first complete remission (CR1). METHODS: The clinical data of patients with newly diagnosed AML (non-acute promyelocytic leukemia) admitted in our department from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017 were analyzed retrospectively, and the relationship between clinical features at the initial diagnosis and the abnormal phenotype cells of CD45dimCD117+ within 2 weeks after CR1 with the prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients with CD45dimCD117+ abnormal cells were detected. The median age was 51 years old, the median WBC count was 11.60×109/L, and the median ratio of bone marrow blast cells was 0.35 at initial diagnosis. According to the FAB classification, 1 (1.1%), 7 (7.7%), 38 (41.7%), 20 (22.0%), 21 (23.1%) and 4 (4.4%) patients were classifice as M0, M1, M2, M4, M5, and M6, respectively. According to the NCCN risk stratification, 30 (33.0%), 51 (56.0%), and 10 (11.0%) patients were determined as good, moderate, and poor prognosis, respectively. The median ratio of abnormal cells within 2 weeks after CR1 was 1.8500 (0.0236-8.0000)%. The median time from initiation of induction therapy to the acquisition of CR was 46 days, median recurrence-free survival time was 319 days, and median overall survival time was 352 days. A total of 45 patients relapsed, of which 14 died; 46 patients did not relapse, of which 3 died. The cutoff of abnormal cells by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was 2.055% (Se=0.733，Sp=0.761). The abnormal cell ratio was＞2.055% in 44 patients, the median ratio of abnormal cells was 3.075%, among which 33 patients relapsed and 12 patients died; the abnormal cell ratio was ＜2.055% in 47 patients, the median ratio of abnormal cells was 1.150%, 12 patients relapsed and 5 patients died. Regression analysis showed that WBC count＞50×109/L and abnormal cell ratio＞2.055% were independent risk factors for recurrence. The abnormal cell ratio＞2.055% group had a 2-year RFS rate of 54.3% and a 2-year OS rate of 52.8%. The abnormal cell ratio＜2.055% group had a 2-year RFS rate of 86.6% (P=0.018), and a 2-year OS rate of 85.3% (P＜0.05). CONCLUSION: For adult AML patients, CD45dimCD117+ phenotypical abnormal cells ratio＞2.055% within 2 weeks after CR1 is an independent risk factor for recurrence, which also is an dverse factor for RFS and OS.",

Following wounding, mice were maintained in either their previous light conditions or switched to the opposite lighting conditions for 3 weeks. DLAN prior to wounding impaired healing; specifically, mice in DLAN/DLAN had significantly larger wounds on day 8. Additionally, mice in DLAN/LD had significantly larger wounds on days 5, 7, 8, and 9, and increased average time to closure. These data demonstrate a potential harmful effect of DLAN on wound healing that should be considered and may represent a target for therapeutic intervention.",

      "abstract": "Mosquitoes are significant vectors, responsible for transmitting serious infectious diseases, including the recent epidemics of global significance caused by, for example, Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. The chemical insecticides in use for mosquito control are toxic and ineffective due to the development of resistance to them. The new approach to reduce mosquito population by releasing genetically modified males to cause female infertility is still under environmental safety evaluation. Photodynamic insecticides (PDI) have long been known as a safe and effective alternative by using dyes as the photosensitizers (PS) for activation with light to generate insecticidal singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species. This approach warrants re-examination with advances in the chemical synthesis of novel PS, e.g. phthalocyanines (PC). Nine PC were compared with five porphyrin derivatives and two classic PS of halogenated fluoresceins, i.e. cyanosine and rose bengal experimentally for photodynamic treatment (PDT) of the larvae of laboratory-reared Aedes mosquitoes and their cell lines. Groups of 2nd instar larvae were first exposed overnight to graded concentrations of each PS in the dark followed by their exposure to dim light for up to 7 hours. Larvae of both experimental and control groups were examined hourly for viability based on their motility. Monolayers of mosquito cells were similarly PS-sensitized and exposed briefly to light at the PS-specific excitation wavelengths. Cell viability was assessed by MTT reduction assays. Of the 16 PS examined for photodynamic inactivation of the mosquito larvae, effective are three novel PC, i.e. amino-Si-PC1 and -PC2, anilinium Zn-PC3.4, pyridyloxy Si-PC14 and two porphyrin derivatives, i.e. TPPS2 and TMAP. Their EC50 values were determined, all falling in the nanomolar range lower than those of rose bengal and cyanosine. All PS effective in vivo were also found to dose-dependently inactivate mosquito cells photodynamically in vitro, providing cellular basis for their larvicidal activities. The present findings of novel PC with effective photodynamic larvicidal activities provide fresh impetus to the development of PDI with their established advantages in safety and efficacy. Toward that end, the insect cell lines are of value for rapid screening of new PC. The optimal excitability of PC with insect-invisible red light is inferred to have the potential to broaden the range of targetable insect pests.",

With the introduction of under layer treatment and fine-tuning of compositions in cobalt-based electrolyte, the power conversion efficiency of cobalt-based DSCs achieves 16.0% under 200 lux illumination. That outperforms the best device using the conventional iodine-based electrolyte illuminated with the same light intensity. Especially, cobalt-based electrolyte system exhibits a higher open circuit voltage than iodine-based electrolyte counterpart. We also investigate perovskite solar cells under dim-light condition. PSCs show higher open circuit voltage and short circuit current density than DSCs with efficiency up to 23.4%.

Our previous study revealed an immunosuppressive activity of IL-35 in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the role of regulatory function of IL-35 to viral specific Tregs/Th17 cells balance in chronic HBV infection. METHODS: A total of 44 HLA-A2 restricted chronic HBV infected patients, including 21 of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 23 of asymptomatic HBV carriers (ASC) were enrolled. Purified CD4+ T cells or CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- Tregs were stimulated with recombinant IL-35. HBV core antigen specific Tregs and Th17 cells were determined by flow cytometry. FoxP3 and RORγt mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. Cytokines production (IL-10 and IL-17) was investigated by ELISA. RESULTS: Peripheral viral specific Tregs was comparable between CHB and ASC. However, increased percentage of viral specific Th17 cells was found in CHB, leading to the reduction of Tregs/Th17 ratio in CHB patients. IL-35 stimulation elevated viral specific Tregs, but not Th17 cells frequency, in both CHB and ASC, resulting in the elevation of Tregs/Th17 ratio in both groups. This process was accompanied by increased expression of FoxP3 mRNA and IL-10 production, and decreased IL-17 secretion and STAT3 phosphorylation in purified CD4+ T cells. Moreover, IL-35 stimulation inhibited viral specific Th17-like phenotype differentiation from Tregs in CHB patients. Effective anti-HBV therapy did not affect viral specific Tregs/Th17 cells frequency or IL-35 expression in CHB patients, however, reduced responsiveness of CD4+ T cells or Tregs to IL-35 stimulation in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that IL-35 regulation to viral specific Tregs/Th17 balance may contribute to viral persistence in chronic HBV infection.",

Thus, the aim of current study was to assess the role of Notch signaling in modulation Tregs and Th17 cells function in gastric cancer (GC) patients. A total of 51 GC patients and 18 normal controls (NCs) were enrolled. Notch1 and Notch2 mRNA expressions were semiquantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Tregs/Th17 percentages, transcriptional factors, and cytokines production were investigated in response to the stimulation of Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT. Both Notch1 and Notch2 mRNA expressions were elevated in GC tissues and peripheral bloods in GC patients. CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- Tregs and Th17 cells percentage was also elevated in GC patients compared with in NCs. DAPT treatment did not affect frequency of either circulating Tregs or Th17 cells, however, reduced FoxP3/RORγt mRNA expression and interleukin (IL)-35/IL-17 production in purified CD4+ T cells from GC patients. Moreover, blockade of Notch signaling also inhibited the suppressive function of purified CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- Tregs from GC patients, which presented as elevation of cellular proliferation and IL-35 secretion. The current data further provided mechanism underlying Tregs-Th17 balance in GC patients. The link between Notch signaling and Th cells might lead to a new therapeutic target for GC patients.",

This study aimed at understanding mechanisms of IVIG-mediated suppression of effector cell activities of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We were particularly interested in CD56dim NK cells, the main ADCC effector cells in PBMC. Exposure of PBMC to IVIG for at least 48 h induced a caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death of CD56dim NK cells without affecting CD56bright NK cells. Induction of apoptosis in CD56dim NK cells and concomitant suppression of ADCC effector activities of PBMC was associated with the monomer fraction of IVIG. Moreover, it was independent of IgG sialyation, did not depend on engagement of FcγRIII and could not be mimicked by IVIG (Fab')2 or IVIG Fc preparations. The described effect could contribute to the reduction of peripheral NK cells observed during IVIG therapy in patients.",

      "abstract": "Ionizing radiation-induced intestinal injury is a catastrophic disease with limited effective therapies. 3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM), a potent antioxidant agent, has previously been shown to ameliorate hematopoietic injury in a murine model of total body radiation injury, but its effects on ionizing radiation-induced intestinal damage are not clear. Here, we demonstrate that administration of DIM not only protects mice against whole abdominal irradiation (WAI)-induced lethality and weight loss but also ameliorates crypt-villus structural and functional injury of the small intestine. In addition, treatment with DIM significant enhances WAI-induced reductions in Lgr5+ ISCs and their progeny cells, including lysozyme+ Paneth cells, Villin+ enterocytes and Ki67+ instantaneous amplifying cells, thus promoting small intestine repair following WAI exposure. Notably, the expression of Nrf2 increased, while the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of γH2AX decreased in the small intestines of DIM-treated mice compared to mice treated with vehicle following WAI. In vitro, we demonstrated that DIM protected human intestinal epithelial cell-6 (HIEC-6) against ionizing radiation, leading to increased cell vitality. Mechanistically, the radioprotective effect of DIM was likely attributable to its anti-DNA damage effects in irradiated HIEC-6 cells. Moreover, these changes were related to reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymatic in irradiated HIEC-6 cells. Additionally, the DIM radioprotective effects on the intestine resulted in the restoration of the WAI-shifted gut bacteria composition in mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the beneficial properties of DIM mitigate intestinal radiation injury, which provides a novel strategy for improving the therapeutic effects of irradiation-induced intestinal injury.",

However, the regulatory activity of DAAs to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation on CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper (Th) 17 cells was not completely understood. In the present study, a total of 23 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection were enrolled, and blood samples were collected at baseline (treatment naive), end of therapy (EOT), and 12 weeks after EOT (SVR12) with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy. TLR2 expression on Tregs and Th17 cells was measured by flow cytometry. Cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and suppressive activity were also tested in purified CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- Tregs in response to the stimulation of Pam3Csk4, an agonist of TLR2. Inhibition of HCV RNA by daclatasvir and asunaprevir did not affect either percentage of Tregs/Th17 cells or TLR2 expression on Tregs/Th17 cells. Pam3Csk4 stimulation also did not influence either cellular proliferation or Tregs/Th17 proportion at each time point. Stimulation with Pam3Csk4 only enhanced the suppressive function and interleukin (IL)-35 production by Tregs purified from baseline, but not those from EOT or SVR12. Similarly, Pam3Csk4 stimulation only elevated Th17 cell frequency of CD4+ T cells from baseline, but not those from EOT or SVR12. Moreover, daclatasvir and asunaprevir therapy did not promote TLR2-induced shift of Tregs toward Th17-like phenotype and function. These data suggested that daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy resulted in the decreased responsiveness of Tregs/Th17 cells to TLR2 stimulation in chronic hepatitis C patients, which might provide a novel mechanism underlying DAA-induced immunoregulation.",

The aim of this study is to investigate, after treatment with nucleoside (acid) analogs (NAs) and the inhibition of viral replication, whether the immune systems of patients with a peripheral blood HBV-DNA level <1000 IU/mL, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) disappearance, and a decrease in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels could be reconstructed. METHODS: The frequency and phenotype of circulating natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), T-helper (Th) cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and B cells subtypes were tested by flow cytometry in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and healthy controls (HCs). The levels of HBV-related serum HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV-DNA load, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined. RESULTS: Regarding the innate immune system, an increased frequency of CD56dim NK cells was found in the therapeutic response (TR) group compared with that in the immune-active phase (IA) group. Additionally, regarding the adaptive immune system, the Th17/CD4+CD25+CD127dimTreg ratio was reduced in the TR group. Additionally, the frequency of CD40L+CXCR5+CD4+T cells and CD40+CD19+CD27+CD38+B cells was significantly higher than that of HCs, while that of PDL1+CD19+ B cells was lower. Furthermore, the frequencies of CTLA4+CD4+T cells and CTLA4+CD8+T cells in patients with CHB were significantly higher than those in HCs. CONCLUSION: After NA treatment and the inhibition of viral replication, circulating CD56dim NK cells and the balance of Th17/Treg can be recovered. Restoring circulating CD56dim NK cells and the Th17/Treg balance may help reduce HBsAg levels in patients.",

We explored the effects of low intensity ALAN over seven months in eight experimental bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations in large grassland enclosures over winter and early breeding season, using LED garden lamps. Initial populations consisted of eight individuals (32 animals per hectare) in enclosures with or without ALAN. We found that bank voles under ALAN experienced changes in daily activity patterns and space use behavior, measured by automated radiotelemetry. There were no differences in survival and body mass, measured with live trapping, and none in levels of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Voles in the ALAN treatment showed higher activity at night during half moon, and had larger day ranges during new moon. Thus, even low levels of light pollution as experienced in remote areas or by sky glow can lead to changes in animal behavior and could have consequences for species interactions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects up to 400 million people worldwide and accounts for approximately one million deaths per year from liver pathologies. Current treatment regimens are effective in suppressing viremia but usually have to be taken indefinitely, warranting research into new therapeutic approaches. Acute HBV infection in adults almost universally results in resolution of viremia, with the exception of immunocompromised persons, suggesting that the immune response can functionally cure or even eradicate HBV infection. METHODS: Because immunophenotypic and functional studies have implicated a role for Natural Killer (NK) cells in HBV clearance during acute infection, we hypothesized that a distinct NK-cell profile exists in acute HBV infection that could provide information for the mechanism of HBV clearance. Using multivariate flow cytometry, we evaluated the expression of key activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells, and their ability to respond to classic target cell lines. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed selective perturbation of the CD56dim NK-cell subset during acute infection, displaying low levels of NKp46+, NKp30+, CD160+ and CD161+ cells. Intriguingly, the CD56dim NK-cell profile predicted time to HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance from the blood, and distinct NK-cell profiles predicted early (NKp30, CD94, CD161) and late clearance (KIR3DL1, CD158a, perforin, NKp46). Finally, functional analysis demonstrated that early and late clearance tracked with elevated degranulation (CD107a) or IFNγ production, respectively, in response to ADCC-mediated activation. CONCLUSION: The cytolytic CD56dim NK-cell subset is selectively activated in acute HBV infection and displays distinct phenotypic and functional profiles associated with efficient and early control of HBV, implicating antibody-mediated cytolytic NK-cell responses in the early control and functional cure of HBV infection."

In particular, recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have made single molecule tracking a prevalent method for studying biomolecules with a high spatial and temporal precision. Particle tracking algorithms have matured over the past three decades into more easily accessible platforms. However, there is an inherent difficulty in tracing particles that have a low signal-to-noise ratio and/or heterogeneous subpopulations. Here, we present a new MATLAB based tracking program which combines the benefits of manual and automatic tracking methods. The program prompts the user to manually locate a particle when an ambiguous situation occurs during automatic tracking. We demonstrate the utility of this program by tracking the movement of β-actin mRNA in the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons. We show that the diffusion coefficient of β-actin mRNA decreases upon neuronal stimulation by bicuculline treatment. This tracking method enables an efficient dissection of the dynamic regulation of biological molecules in highly complex intracellular environments.",

In this study one further derivative, namely R-DIM-P-LF11-334 is shown to exhibit even increased cancer toxicity in vitro and in vivo while non-neoplastic cells are not harmed. In liposomal model systems composed of phosphatidylserine mimicking cancerous and phosphatidylcholine mimicking non-cancerous membranes the specific interaction with the cancer marker PS was confirmed by specific induction of membrane perturbation and permeabilization in presence of the peptide. In vitro studies with cell lines of human malignant melanoma, such as A375, or primary cells of human melanoma metastases to the brain, as MUG Mel1, and non-neoplastic human dermal fibroblasts NHDF revealed high cytotoxic effect of R-DIM-P-LF11-334 on melanoma cells of A375 and MUG Mel1, whereas only minor effect on the dermal fibroblasts NHDF was observed, yielding an about 20-fold killing-specificity for A375 and MUG-Mel1. The LC50 values for melanoma A375 and MUG Mel1 were about 10 μM. Analysis of secondary structure of the peptide revealed an increase in the proportion of β-sheets exclusively in presence of the cancer mimic. Stability studies further indicated a potential adequate stability in blood or under stringent conditions. Importantly the cytotoxic effect on cancer cells was also proven in vivo in mouse xenografts of human melanoma, where peptide treatment induced strong tumor regression and in average a tumor area reduction of 85% compared to tumors of control mice without peptide treatment."

The clinical use of this broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic agent is restricted due to development of severe form of cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, and genotoxicity which interfere with therapeutic schedule, compromise treatment outcome and may lead to secondary malignancy. 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) is a naturally occurring plant alkaloid formed by the hydrolysis of indolylmethyl glucosinolate (glucobrassicin). Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the protective role of DIM against DOX-induced toxicity in mice. DOX was administered (5 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) and DIM was administered (25 mg/kg b.w., p.o.) in concomitant and 15 days pretreatment schedule. Results showed that DIM significantly attenuated DOX-induced oxidative stress in the cardiac tissues by reducing the levels of free radicals and lipid peroxidation, and by enhancing the level of glutathione (reduced) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The chemoprotective potential of DIM was confirmed by histopathological evaluation of heart and bone marrow niche. Moreover, DIM considerably mitigated DOX-induced clastogenicity, DNA damage, apoptosis, and myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow niche. In addition, oral administration of DIM significantly (p < .05) stimulated the Nrf2-mediated activation of antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway and promoted expression of ARE-driven cytoprotective proteins, HO-1, NQO1, and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). In connection with that, DIM significantly attenuated DOX-induced apoptosis by upregulation of Bcl-2 expression and downregulation of Bax and caspase-3 expression. Thus, this study suggests that DIM has promising chemoprotective efficacy against DOX-induced toxicity and indicates its future use as an adjuvant in chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent in patients with a chronic physical condition, and this comorbidity has a negative influence on quality of life, health care costs, self-care, morbidity, and mortality. Research has shown that collaborative care (CC) may be a cost-effective treatment. However, its cost-effectiveness in this patient group has not yet been established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of CC for the treatment of comorbid MDD in chronically ill patients in the outpatient general hospital setting. The study was conducted from a health care and societal perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 81 patients with moderate-to-severe MDD were included; 42 were randomly assigned to the CC group and 39 to the care as usual (CAU) group. We applied the TiC-P, short-form Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire, and EuroQol EQ-5D 3 level version, measuring the use of health care, informal care, and household work, respectively, at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up. RESULTS: The mean annual direct medical costs in the CC group were €6,718 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3,541 to 10,680) compared to €4,582 (95% CI: 2,782 to 6,740) in the CAU group. The average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were 0.07 higher in the CC group, indicating that CC is more costly but also more effective than CAU. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €24,690/QALY. CONCLUSION: This first cost-utility analysis in chronically ill patients with comorbid MDD shows that CC may be a cost-effective treatment depending on willingness-to-pay levels. Nevertheless, the low utility scores emphasize the need for further research to improve the cost-effectiveness of CC in this highly prevalent and costly group of patients."

Whereas blood CD56brightCD16dim/- NK cells are classically viewed as immature precursors and cytokine producers, the larger CD56dimCD16bright subset is considered as the most cytotoxic one. In peripheral blood of healthy donors, we noticed the existence of a population of CD56dimCD16dim NK cells that was frequently higher in number than the CD56bright subsets and even expanded in occasional control donors but also in transporter associated with antigen processing-deficient patients, two familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type II patients, and several common variable immunodeficiency patients. This population was detected but globally reduced in a longitudinal cohort of 18 HIV-1-infected individuals. Phenotypically, the new subset contained a high percentage of relatively immature cells, as reflected by a significantly stronger representation of NKG2A+ and CD57- cells compared to their CD56dimCD16bright counterparts. The phenotype of the CD56dimCD16dim population was differentially affected by HIV-1 infection as compared to the other NK cell subsets and only partly restored to normal by antiretroviral therapy. From the functional point of view, sorted CD56dimCD16dim cells degranulated more than CD56dimCD16bright cells but less than CD56dimCD16- NK cells. The population was also identified in various organs of immunodeficient mice with a human immune system (\"humanized\" mice) reconstituted from human cord blood stem cells. In conclusion, the CD56dimCD16dim NK cell subpopulation displays distinct phenotypic and functional features. It remains to be clarified if these cells are the immediate precursors of the CD56dimCD16bright subset or placed somewhere else in the NK cell differentiation and maturation pathway."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 118 women with a history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome experiencing fetal loss in spite of low dose aspirin (LDA) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment in the current pregnancy were included in this study. A group of 32 patients undergoing an elective termination of viable pregnancies before 20 weeks were taken as controls. Suction evacuation was performed to collect abortus specimens, and uterine wall curettage was performed to collect decidua specimens, which were then stained using monoclonal antibodies specific to CD56 and CD16. STATISTICS: Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 18 software. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used for making comparison between the groups. RESULTS: Abnormal fetal karyotype was found in nine (9/97) cases of the study group, which means that abnormal karyotype accounts for only 9.3% of the causes of failure of treatment. Abnormal karyotype was found in four cases of the control group. Only cases with normal karyotyping were subjected to decidual uNK cells analysis. We found that CD56dim and CD16+ were found in the decidua of 79 cases (79/97), which means that aberrant natural killer cells expression might account for 81.4% of the cases of refractory antiphospholipid antibody (APA)-mediated recurrent pregnancy loss. CONCLUSION: CD56dim and CD16+ uNK cells might be correlated with refractory APA-mediated recurrent pregnancy loss."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Natural red fluorescence is particularly conspicuous in the eyes of some small, benthic, predatory fishes. Fluorescence also increases in relative efficiency with increasing depth, which has generated speculation about its possible function as a \"light organ\" to detect cryptic organisms under bluish light. Here we investigate whether foraging success is improved under ambient conditions that make red fluorescence stand out more, using the triplefin Tripterygion delaisi as a model system. We repeatedly presented 10 copepods to individual fish (n = 40) kept under a narrow blue-green spectrum and compared their performance with that under a broad spectrum with the same overall brightness. The experiment was repeated for two levels of brightness, a shaded one representing 0.4% of the light present at the surface and a heavily shaded one with about 0.01% of the surface brightness. RESULTS: Fish were 7% more successful at catching copepods under the narrow, fluorescence-friendly spectrum than under the broad spectrum. However, this effect was significant under the heavily shaded light treatment only. CONCLUSIONS: This outcome corroborates previous predictions that fluorescence may be an adaptation to blue-green, heavily shaded environments, which coincides with the opportunistic biology of this species that lives in the transition zone between exposed and heavily shaded microhabitats.",

Whilst many of these phenotypes are 'direct' effects of light on affect, an 'indirect' pathway via altered sleep-wake timing has been suggested. We have previously shown that the Period3 gene, which forms part of the biological clock, is associated with altered sleep-wake patterns in response to light. Here, we show that both wild-type and Per3-/- mice showed elevated levels of circulating corticosterone and increased hippocampal Bdnf expression after 3 weeks of exposure to dim light at night, but only mice deficient for the PERIOD3 protein (Per3-/-) exhibited a transient anhedonia-like phenotype, observed as reduced sucrose preference, in weeks 2-3 of dim light at night, whereas WT mice did not. Per3-/- mice also exhibited a significantly smaller delay in behavioural timing than WT mice during weeks 1, 2 and 4 of dim light at night exposure. When treated with imipramine, neither Per3-/- nor WT mice exhibited an anhedonia-like phenotype, and neither genotypes exhibited a delay in behavioural timing in responses to dLAN. While the association between both Per3-/- phenotypes remains unclear, both are alleviated by imipramine treatment during dim night-time light.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of natural killer (NK) cells in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is poorly understood. We recently reported that peripheral blood NK cell percentages correlate with the suppression of GPA activity (cohort I). The purpose of the current study was to further characterize NK cell subsets, phenotype and function in a second GPA cohort (cohort II). METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were analyzed at a clinical diagnostic laboratory. Clinical data were extracted from medical records and patients were grouped according to their activity state (remission vs. active/non-remission). Separate analysis (cohort II, n = 22) and combined analysis (cohorts I and II, n = 34/57) of NK cell counts/percentages was performed. NK cell subsets and phenotypes were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using (51)Cr-labeled K562 target cells. RESULTS: In cohort II, NK cell counts were lower than the lower limit of normal in active GPA, despite normal percentages due to lymphopenia. NK cell counts, but not other lymphocyte counts, were significantly higher in remission. Combined analysis of cohorts I and II confirmed decreased NK cell counts in active GPA and increased percentages in long-term remission. Follow-up measurements of six patients revealed increasing NK cell percentages during successful induction therapy. Multicolor analysis from cohort II revealed that in active GPA, the CD56(dim) subset was responsible for decreased NK cell counts, expressed more frequently CD69, downregulated the Fc-receptor CD16 and upregulated the adhesion molecule CD54, the chemokine receptor CCR5 and the activating receptor NKG2C. In remission, these markers were unaltered or marginally altered. All other receptors investigated (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, DNAM1, 2B4, CRACC, 41BB) remained unchanged. Natural cytotoxicity was not detectable in most patients with active GPA, but was restored in remission. CONCLUSIONS: NK cell numbers correlate inversely with GPA activity. Reduced CD56(dim) NK cells in active GPA have an activated phenotype, which intriguingly is associated with profound deficiency in cytotoxicity. These data suggest a function for NK cells in the pathogenesis and/or modulation of inflammation in GPA. NK cell numbers, phenotype (CD16, CD69, NKG2C) or overall natural cytotoxicity are promising candidates to serve as clinical biomarkers to determine GPA activity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) often manifest during the adolescent years. Measurement of circadian phase such as the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) improves diagnosis and treatment of these disorders, but financial and time costs limit the use of DLMO phase assessments in clinic. The current analysis aims to inform a cost-effective and efficient protocol to measure the DLMO in older adolescents by reducing the number of samples and total sampling duration. PATIENTS/METHODS: A total of 66 healthy adolescents (26 males) aged 14.8-17.8 years participated in a study; they were required to sleep on a fixed baseline schedule for a week before which they visited the laboratory for saliva collection in dim light (<20 lux). Two partial 6-h salivary melatonin profiles were derived for each participant. Both profiles began 5 h before bedtime and ended 1 h after bedtime, but one profile was derived from samples taken every 30 min (13 samples) and the other from samples taken every 60 min (seven samples). Three standard thresholds (first three melatonin values mean + 2 SDs, 3 pg/mL, and 4 pg/mL) were used to compute the DLMO. An agreement between DLMOs derived from 30-min and 60-min sampling rates was determined using Bland-Altman analysis; agreement between the sampling rate DLMOs was defined as ± 1 h. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Within a 6-h sampling window, 60-min sampling provided DLMO estimates within ± 1 h of DLMO from 30-min sampling, but only when an absolute threshold (3 or 4 pg/mL) was used to compute the DLMO. Future analyses should be extended to include adolescents with CRSWDs.",

An interim study of the efficacy of a new drug Infemin on the basis of diindolylmethane (DIM) with improved bioavalability has been conducted. METHODS: The clinical trial had a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design and was carried out in two parallel groups. The interim analysis of data included 21 patients diagnosed with a high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Group 1 (11 patients) received Infemin in a dose of 900 mg of DIM a day, and group 2 (10 patients) received placebo. To assess the efficacy of therapy, the analysis of morphological index (MI) changes based on the results of histological examinations of prostate biopsy specimens was performed, and a proportion of patients with persistent PIN in 12 months after Infemin initiation was calculated. Researchers also evaluated prostate size, urodynamic parameters (Qmax, Qave, Vres), IPSS, and QoL (quality of life) indices and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the Infemin administration start. RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment in the Infemin group, MI decreased from 0.50 to 0.08, while in the placebo group, it increased from 0.27 to 0.58; the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0003, Mann-Whitney test). In 45.5 % of patients in the Infemin group, a complete regression of PIN was also observed, while in the placebo group, PIN regression was not observed in any patients (p = 0.053, Yates' corrected chi-square). Study results in the Infemin group show improvement of maximal urinary flow rate Qmax (53.3 % increase compared to the initial value); however, the statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.180, Mann-Whitney test) due to the small sample size. Evaluation of other urodynamic parameters, prostate volume, quality of life, symptoms reflecting urination disorder, and erectile dysfunction symptoms did not reveal significant differences between the Infemin and placebo groups either which is probably due to the small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The intermediate results of the 21 patients in this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study show that Infemin may be a promising drug candidate in patients with  high-grade PIN.

Home DLMOs are attractive for cost savings and convenience, but can be confounded by home lighting and sample timing errors. We developed a home saliva collection kit with objective measures of light exposure and sample timing. We report on our first test of the kit in a clinical population. Thirty-two participants with delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD; 17 women, aged 18-52 years) participated in two back-to-back home and laboratory phase assessments. Most participants (66%) received at least one 30-s epoch of light >50 lux during the home phase assessments, but for only 1.5% of the time. Most participants (56%) collected every saliva sample within 5 min of the scheduled time. Eighty-three per cent of home DLMOs were not affected by light or sampling errors. The home DLMOs occurred, on average, 10.2 min before the laboratory DLMOs, and were correlated highly with the laboratory DLMOs (r = 0.93, P < 0.001). These results indicate that home saliva sampling with objective measures of light exposure and sample timing, can assist in identifying accurate home DLMOs.",

In vitro fertilization (IVF) has become a common and accessible treatment for a wide variety of indications that have variable outcomes. Natural killer (NK) cells have been identified as relevant immunological factors involved in reproductive success or failure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the percentage of peripheral blood CD56(+) (CD56(dim) and CD56(bright)) cells and the level of NK cell in patients with IVF failure with those of successful IVF control women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the level of CD56(dim) CD16(+) and CD56(bright) CD16(-) cells in 50 women under IVF treatment and compared between successful IVF and IVF failure with the flowcytometry technique. RESULTS: Of studied women, 68% did not response to IVF therapy and 32% had successful IVF, the level of CD56(dim) CD16(+) cells in women with IVF failure was significantly higher than successful IVF (p<0.0001) but the level of CD56(bright) CD16(-) cells was not significantly different between women with IVF failure and successful IVF (p=0.28). CONCLUSION: The results of present study demonstrated that the level of NK cells as a risk factor is associated with pregnancy loss in women with IVF failure. However, number of sample in this study is low and further studies with more sample size are needed to be done. We suggest considering treatment option for women undergoing repeated IVF failure with increased percentage of CD56(dim) cells and the level of peripheral blood NK cell."

      "abstract": "Management of neuropathic foot ulcers in patients with diabetes (DFUs) has changed little over the past decade, and there is currently no objective method to gauge probability of successful healing. We hypothesized that studies of stem/progenitor cells (SPCs) in the early weeks of standard wound management could predict who will heal within 16 weeks. Blood and debrided wound margins were collected for 8 weeks from 100 patients undergoing weekly evaluations and treatment. SPC number and intracellular content of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) were evaluated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. More SPCs entered the bloodstream in the first 2 weeks of care in patients who healed (n = 37) than in those who did not (n = 63). Logistic regression demonstrated that the number of blood-borne SPCs and the cellular content of HIFs at study entry and the first-week follow-up visit predicted healing. Strong correlations were found among week-to-week assessments of blood-borne SPC HIF factors. We conclude that assays of SPCs during the first weeks of care in patients with DFUs can provide insight into how well wounds will respond and may aid with decisions on the use of adjunctive measures.",

Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is known to restore phenotype and functions of NK cells. However, the effects of ART on NK cell terminal differentiation, activation, and disturbed distribution have not been studied yet longitudinally. Here, we analyzed the effects of ART on these parameters of peripheral blood NK cells in a longitudinal as well as in a cross-sectional study. We observed that expanded CD56(-)CD16(+) NK cell frequency is inversely correlated with the frequency of CD56(dim)CD16(+) NK cells in treatment-naive HIV-1 patients. Loss of CD56(dim)CD16(+) and expansion of CD56(-)CD16(+) NK cells again restore to the levels of healthy controls after ART. Enhanced immune activation of different NK cell subsets is partially restored after ART. Terminal differentiation of CD56(dim)CD16(+) NK cells is enhanced after ART as measured by CD57 expression. Frequencies of CD57(+)CD56(dim)CD16(+) NK cells are directly correlated with the frequencies of total NK cells suggesting that an increase in the frequencies of CD57(+)CD56(dim)CD16(+) NK cells is reflected by increased frequencies of total NK cells after ART. Taken together these data demonstrate that ART has an effect on the immune restoration of NK cells and is enhanced in the terminal differentiation of CD56(dim)CD16(+) NK cells, which is associated with increased frequencies of total NK cells after ART.",

However, it is not always possible to measure the DLMO because sample collection has to occur in the hours before usual sleep onset, it requires staff support and considerable participant effort, and it is relatively expensive. Questionnaires that ask people about the timing of their behavior, such as their sleep, may provide an easier and less expensive estimate of circadian timing. The objective of this analysis was to compare the MEQ score derived from the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and the MSFsc derived from the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) to the DLMO in the largest sample to date (N = 60). Our hypothesis was that MSFsc would correlate more highly with the DLMO than MEQ score. Our sample of 36 healthy controls and 24 patients with delayed sleep phase disorder ranged in age from 18 to 62 years. All participants slept at times of their own choosing for a week before the assessment of their DLMO. The DLMO correlated significantly with both the MEQ score (r = -0.70, p < 0.001) and MSFsc (r = 0.68, p < 0.001). A linear regression using MEQ, MSFsc, and age to predict the DLMO explained 60% of the DLMO variance. The strongest predictor of the DLMO was MSFsc (beta = 0.51, p = 0.001), followed by MEQ (beta = -0.41, p = 0.004), and age (beta = 0.26, p = 0.013). The beta values for MSFsc and MEQ score were not statistically different from each other. Nonetheless, around a 4-h range in the DLMO was observed at a given MEQ score and a given MSFsc, indicating that neither questionnaire should be exclusively used to time light or exogenous melatonin treatment, as this could result in the mistiming of these treatments relative to the DLMO, thereby potentially worsening circadian misalignment.",

Studies have shown that, as regulators of gene expression, microRNAs are widely involved in various human diseases, including hepatitis B virus-related liver diseases. By modulating hepatitis B virus replication, regulating extracellular matrix formation, as well as silencing tumor suppressor genes, these small molecules are implicated in the development of chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma caused by hepatitis B virus infection. In addition, current researches indicated a potential role of microRNA as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. In conclusion, microRNAs are promising tools in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B virus -related liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "CD14dimCD16+ and CD14brightCD16+ cells, which compose a minor population of monocytes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), have been implicated in several inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this phenotype was present as a subset of lung infiltrative alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the granulomatous lung disease, chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The monocytes subsets was determined from PBMC cells and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from CBD, beryllium sensitized Non-smoker (BeS-NS) and healthy subjects (HS) using flow cytometry. The impact of smoking on the AMs cell phenotype was determined by using BAL cells from BeS smokers (BeS-S). In comparison with the other monocyte subpopulations, CD14dimCD16+ cells were at decreased frequency in PBMCs of both BeS-NS and CBD and showed higher HLA-DR expression, compared to HS. The AMs from CBD and BeS-NS demonstrated a CD14dimCD16+phenotype, while CD14brightCD16+ cells were found at increased frequency in AMs of BeS, compared to HS. Fresh AMs from BeS-NS and CBD demonstrated significantly greater CD16, CD40, CD86 and HLA-DR than HS and BeS-S. The expression of CD16 on AMs from both CBD and BeS-NS was downregulated significantly after 10μM BeSO4 stimulation. The phagocytic activity of AMs decreased after 10μM BeSO4 treatment in both BeS-NS and CBD, although was altered or reduced in HS and BeS-S. These results suggest that Be increases the CD14dimCD16+ subsets in the lung of CBD subjects. We speculate that Be-stimulates the compartmentalization of a more mature CD16+ macrophage phenotype and that in turn these macrophages are a source of Th1 cytokines and chemokines that perpetuate the Be immune response in CBD. The protective effect of cigarette smoking in BeS-S may be due to the low expression of co-stimulatory markers on AMs from smokers as well as the decreased phagocytic function.",

Light therapies that specifically target regulation of the circadian system in principle could be used to treat sleep disorders in this population. Current recommendations for light treatment require the patients to sit in front of a bright light box for at least 1 hour daily, perhaps limiting their willingness to comply. Light applied through closed eyelids during sleep might not only be efficacious for changing circadian phase but also lead to better compliance because patients would receive light treatment while sleeping. Reported here are the results of two studies investigating the impact of a train of 480 nm (blue) light pulses presented to the retina through closed eyelids on melatonin suppression (laboratory study) and on delaying circadian phase (field study). Both studies employed a sleep mask that provided narrowband blue light pulses of 2-second duration every 30 seconds from arrays of light-emitting diodes. The results of the laboratory study demonstrated that the blue light pulses significantly suppressed melatonin by an amount similar to that previously shown in the same protocol at half the frequency (ie, one 2-second pulse every minute for 1 hour). The results of the field study demonstrated that blue light pulses given early in the sleep episode significantly delayed circadian phase in older adults; these results are the first to demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of light treatment by a sleep mask aimed at adjusting circadian phase in a home setting."

Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is considered to be promising as a personalized and preventive treatment strategy of prostate cancer (PC). We assessed the safety of Infemin in men with PIN and discussed the interim results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 14 patients with PIN were enrolled. They were randomized to 900 mg DIM or placebo daily for 3 months. Safety was evaluated by adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests and physical examinations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The trial revealed that Infemin treatment is associated with minimal toxicity and no serious adverse events when administered orally for 3 months. We noted three adverse events including nausea and diarrhea in two patients (14%). Combined 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.8%-42.8%. Therapy was continued in all cases of adverse events. Good tolerability of DIM-based formulation allows us to recommend it for further clinical trials among men diagnosed with PIN for its efficacy and long-term safety parameters."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nursing home residents often have a high number of comorbidities resulting in polypharmacy. Inappropriate prescribing is therefore likely to occur, which in turn is expected to worsen cognitive impairment, to increase the fall risk and to decrease residents' quality of life. The objective of the 'Discontinuing Inappropriate Medication in Nursing Home Residents' (DIM-NHR) study is to examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Multidisciplinary Multistep Medication Review (3MR) that is aimed at optimising prescribing and discontinuing inappropriate medication. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Elderly care physicians and their wards (clusters) will be randomised. Data will be collected at baseline and 4 months after the 3MR has taken place. Six hundred nursing home residents will be recruited of whom more than half are expected to suffer from dementia. The 3MR will be based on consensus criteria and the relevant literature and will be performed by the patient's elderly care physician in collaboration with a pharmacist. ANALYSIS: Primary outcomes-the difference in proportion of residents who successfully discontinued inappropriate medication between the intervention and control group at follow-up. Secondary outcomes-undertreatment, exposure to anticholinergic and sedative medicines, neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, falls, hospital admission, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Participant burden will be kept at a minimum. The elderly care physician will remain free to adjust medication when symptoms relapse or adverse events occur, rendering serious adverse events highly unlikely. Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and a 3MR toolkit will be developed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This study has been registered at http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration number: NCT01876095).",

Blood from twenty consecutive patients was obtained before and after the 1st, 10th and 20th treatment at two clinical centers using protocols involving exposures to oxygen at either 2.0 or 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Post-treatment values of CD34+, CD45-dim leukocytes were always 2-fold greater than the pre-treatment values for both protocols. Values for those treated at 2.5 ATA were significantly greater than those treated at 2.0 ATA by factors of 1.9 to 3-fold after the 10th and before and after the 20th treatments. Intracellular content of hypoxia inducible factors -1, -2, and -3, thioredoxin-1 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase assessed in permeabilized CD34+ cells with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were twice as high in all post- versus pre-treatment samples with no significant differences between 2.0 and 2.5 ATA protocols. We conclude that putative progenitor cell mobilization is higher with 2.5 versus 2.0 ATA treatments, and all newly mobilized cells exhibit higher concentrations of an array of regulatory proteins.",

Several studies have addressed how environmental cues, such as light, can reset or synchronize a circadian system. By means of an optimized firefly luciferase reporter gene and a controllable lighting system, we show that Neurospora can display molecular circadian rhythms in dim light when cultures receive bright light prior to entering dim light conditions. We refer to this behavior as the \"bright to dim oscillatory response\" (BDOR). The bright light treatment can be applied up to 76 h prior to dim exposure, and it can be as short as 15 min in duration. We have characterized this response in respect to the duration of the light pulse, the time of the light pulse before dim, the intensity of dim light, and the oscillation dynamics in dim light. Although the molecular mechanism that drives the BDOR remains obscure, these findings suggest that a long-term memory of bright light exists as part of the circadian molecular components. It is important to consider the ecological significance of such dim light responses in respect to how organisms naturally maintain their timing mechanism in moonlight.",

Exogenous melatonin is increasingly being used in patients with insomnia or CRSD. Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1-2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results.",

      "abstract": "Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling is critically important during the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). The AR signaling is also important in the development of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) where AR is functional even after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); however, little is known regarding the transcriptional and functional regulation of AR in PCa. Moreover, treatment options for primary PCa for preventing the occurrence of CRPC is limited; therefore, novel strategy for direct inactivation of AR is urgently needed. In this study, we found loss of miR-34a, which targets AR, in PCa tissue specimens, especially in patients with higher Gleason grade tumors, consistent with increased expression of AR. Forced over-expression of miR-34a in PCa cell lines led to decreased expression of AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA) as well as the expression of Notch-1, another important target of miR-34a. Most importantly, BR-DIM intervention in PCa patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed reexpression of miR-34a, which was consistent with decreased expression of AR, PSA and Notch-1 in PCa tissue specimens. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention led to nuclear exclusion both in PCa cell lines and in tumor tissues. PCa cells treated with BR-DIM and 5-aza-dC resulted in the demethylation of miR-34a promoter concomitant with inhibition of AR and PSA expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells. These results suggest, for the first time, epigenetic silencing of miR-34a in PCa, which could be reversed by BR-DIM treatment and, thus BR-DIM could be useful for the inactivation of AR in the treatment of PCa.[This corrects the article on p. 14 in vol. 4.]."

Here, we characterize the CD14(+) mononuclear cell populations in intestinal mucosa and blood in patients with CD. Among the LP CD14(+) M, we identified three distinct HLA-DR(+)-expressing subsets. Compared with uninflamed, inflamed mucosa contained a marked increase in the proportion of the CD14(hi)HLA-DR(dim) cellular subset. This subset resembled the classical blood monocytes with low CD16, HLA-DR, and CX3CR1 expression. Classical monocytes migrated efficiently toward CCL2 and released the highest levels of MMP-1 and proinflammatory cytokines when stimulated with immune complexes or LPS. Our findings strongly suggest that it is the classical and not the intermediate or nonclassical monocytes that are the precursors to the dominating intestinal CD14(hi)HLA-DR(dim) subset.

      "abstract": "The increased prevalence of circadian disruptions due to abnormal coupling between internal and external time makes the detection of circadian phase in humans by ambulatory recordings a compelling need. Here, we propose an accurate practical procedure to estimate circadian phase with the least possible burden for the subject, that is, without the restraints of a constant routine protocol or laboratory techniques such as melatonin quantification, both of which are standard procedures. In this validation study, subjects (N = 13) wore ambulatory monitoring devices, kept daily sleep diaries and went about their daily routine for 10 days. The devices measured skin temperature at wrist level (WT), motor activity and body position on the arm, and light exposure by means of a sensor placed on the chest. Dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was used to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the ambulatory variables in assessing circadian phase. An evening increase in WT: WTOnset (WTOn) and \"WT increase onset\" (WTiO) was found to anticipate the evening increase in melatonin, while decreases in motor activity (Activity Offset or AcOff), body position (Position Offset (POff)), integrative TAP (a combination of WT, activity and body position) (TAPOffset or TAPOff) and an increase in declared sleep propensity were phase delayed with respect to DLMO. The phase markers obtained from subjective sleep (R = 0.811), WT (R = 0.756) and the composite variable TAP (R = 0.720) were highly and significantly correlated with DLMO. The findings strongly support a new method to calculate circadian phase based on WT (WTiO) that accurately predicts and shows a temporal association with DLMO. WTiO is especially recommended due to its simplicity and applicability to clinical use under conditions where knowing endogenous circadian phase is important, such as in cancer chronotherapy and light therapy.",

Efficacy of the dim nocturnal illumination (0.03 lx) in accelerating the reentrainment following simulated jetlags in Drosophila biarmipes was examined by subjecting the flies to 24 h light-dark cycles in which the 12 h photophase was at 300 lx for all flies but the scotophase was at 0 and 0.03 lx for the control and experimental flies, respectively. Reentrainment was always faster in the experimental flies than the control ones. Moreover, unlike melatonin, the dimly lit nights accelerated the reentrainment following both, the phase advance and delay of the light-dark cycles.

Accumulating evidence suggests that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays an essential role in cellular energy homeostasis and tumor development and that targeting AMPK may be a promising therapeutic option for cancer treatment in the clinic. We previously reported that a formulated DIM (BR-DIM; hereafter referred as B-DIM) with higher bioavailability was able to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth, angiogenesis, and invasion of prostate cancer cells. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) for the anti-cancer effects of B-DIM have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated whether AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular target of B-DIM in human prostate cancer cells. Our results showed, for the first time, that B-DIM could activate the AMPK signaling pathway, associated with suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), down-regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression, and induction of apoptosis in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells. B-DIM also activates AMPK and down-regulates AR in androgen-independent C4-2B prostate tumor xenografts in SCID mice. These results suggest that B-DIM could be used as a potential anti-cancer agent in the clinic for prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer regardless of androgen responsiveness, although functional AR may be required.",

Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is the most common complication of pregnancy. Some couples suffer from infertility of unknown cause. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one of the useful treatment methods used for treatment of this type for infertility with variable outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the percentage of peripheral blood CD56(+) (CD56(dim) and CD56(bright)) cells and the level of NK cell cytotoxicity in patients with RSA and patients with IVF failure with those of healthy multiparous and successful IVF control women. In this case-control study peripheral blood samples from 43 patients, which included 23 women with RSA and 20 with IVF failure, plus 43 healthy control women comprising 36 normal multiparous women and 7 women with successful IVF, were collected. The percentage of peripheral blood NK cells (CD56(+)) was identified by flow cytometry, then peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density centrifugation (Ficol-Hypaque) and incubated with NK-sensitive K562 cells. The NK cell cytotoxicity level was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. The percentage of CD56(dim) cells and the level of peripheral blood NK cell cytotoxicity in RSA patients and women with IVF failure were significantly higher than in both the healthy multiparous and successful IVF control groups (P<0.001). The findings of the present study suggest that increases in the percentage of CD56(dim) cells and NK cytotoxicity in peripheral blood may be important contributing factors for both RSA and IVF failure.",

Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its metabolite diindolylmethane (DIM) were identified in these plants as active ingredients and theirs anti-tumor activities were confirmed in multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments. Here, we demonstrate that DIM is a selective and potent inhibitor of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In several cancer cell lines, DIM inhibited tumor sphere formation at the concentrations 30-300 times lower than concentrations required for growth inhibition of parental cells cultured as adherent culture. We also found that treatment with DIM overcomes chemoresistance of CSCs to cytotoxics, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and SN-38. Pre-treatment of tumor spheres with DIM before implantation to mice significantly retarded the growth of primary tumors compared to tumors formed by untreated tumor spheres. The concentrations of DIM required to suppress CSCs formation are in the close range to those achievable in human plasma after oral dosing of the compound. Therefore, DIM can potentially be used in cancer patients, either alone, or in combinations with existing drugs.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) contributes to the high mortality of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), which in part could be attributed to the existence and the emergence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent studies have shown that deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to the initiation and progression of PCa. Among several known miRNAs, let-7 family appears to play a key role in the recurrence and progression of PCa by regulating CSCs; however, the mechanism by which let-7 family contributes to PCa aggressiveness is unclear. Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a putative target of let-7 family, was demonstrated to control stem cell function. In this study, we found loss of let-7 family with corresponding over-expression of EZH2 in human PCa tissue specimens, especially in higher Gleason grade tumors. Overexpression of let-7 by transfection of let-7 precursors decreased EZH2 expression and repressed clonogenic ability and sphere-forming capacity of PCa cells, which was consistent with inhibition of EZH2 3'UTR luciferase activity. We also found that the treatment of PCa cells with BR-DIM (formulated DIM: 3,3'-diindolylmethane by Bio Response, Boulder, CO, abbreviated as BR-DIM) up-regulated let-7 and down-regulated EZH2 expression, consistent with inhibition of self-renewal and clonogenic capacity. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention in our on-going phase II clinical trial in patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed upregulation of let-7 consistent with down-regulation of EZH2 expression in PCa tissue specimens after BR-DIM intervention. These results suggest that the loss of let-7 mediated increased expression of EZH2 contributes to PCa aggressiveness, which could be attenuated by BR-DIM treatment, and thus BR-DIM is likely to have clinical impact.",

The AR signaling is also important in the development of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) where AR is functional even after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); however, little is known regarding the transcriptional and functional regulation of AR in PCa. Moreover, treatment options for primary PCa for preventing the occurrence of CRPC is limited; therefore, novel strategy for direct inactivation of AR is urgently needed. In this study, we found loss of miR-34a, which targets AR, in PCa tissue specimens, especially in patients with higher Gleason grade tumors, consistent with increased expression of AR. Forced overexpression of miR-34a in PCa cell lines led to decreased expression of AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA) as well as the expression of Notch-1, another important target of miR-34a. Most importantly, BR-DIM intervention in PCa patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed re-expression of miR-34a, which was consistent with decreased expression of AR, PSA and Notch-1 in PCa tissue specimens. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention led to nuclear exclusion both in PCa cell lines and in tumor tissues. PCa cells treated with BR-DIM and 5-aza-dC resulted in the demethylation of miR-34a promoter concomitant with inhibition of AR and PSA expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells. These results suggest, for the first time, epigenetic silencing of miR -34a in PCa, which could be reversed by BR-DIM treatment and, thus BR-DIM could be useful for the inactivation of AR in the treatment of PCa."

Interestingly, thymocytes isolated from the GR(dim) mice were reported to be resistant to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. To further evaluate the dim mutations in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, we stably expressed either the hGR(dim) (A458T) or the hGR(dim4) (A458T, R460D, D462C, and N454D) mutant receptors in human osteosarcoma (U-2 OS) cells that are devoid of hGR and unresponsive to glucocorticoids. We analyzed these cell lines by comparison with a stable expression hGRα U-2 OS cell line, which undergoes apoptosis after glucocorticoid treatment. Transient reporter gene assays with glucocorticoid response element-driven vectors revealed that the hGR(dim) mutation had diminished steroid responsiveness and cells carrying the hGR(dim4) mutation were unresponsive to steroid, whereas glucocorticoid-induced nuclear factor κB repression was unaffected by either mutation. Interestingly, both the hGR(dim) and hGR(dim4) receptors readily formed dimers as measured by immunoprecipitation. Examination of GR-mediated apoptosis showed that hGR(dim) cells were only partially resistant to apoptosis, whereas hGR(dim4) cells were completely resistant to glucocorticoid-induced cell death despite remaining sensitive to other apoptotic stimuli. Global gene expression analysis revealed that hGR(dim4) cells widely regulated gene expression but differentially regulated apoptotic mRNA when compared with cells expressing wild-type hGRα. These studies challenge conclusions drawn from previous studies of GR dim mutants.",

The active compound in cruciferous vegetables appears to be the self dimerized product [3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM)] of indole-3-carbinol (I3C). Nutritional grade B-DIM (absorption-enhanced) has proven safe in a Phase I trial in PCa. We investigated the anti-cancer activity of B-DIM as a new biological approach to improve the effects of radiotherapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer cells, which were either positive or negative for androgen receptor (AR) expression. B-DIM inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner in both PC-3 (AR-) and C4-2B (AR+) cell lines. B-DIM was effective at increasing radiation-induced cell killing in both cell lines, independently of AR expression. B-DIM inhibited NF-κB and HIF-1α DNA activities and blocked radiation-induced activation of these transcription factors in both PC-3 and C4-2B cells. In C4-2B (AR+) cells, AR expression and nuclear localization were significantly increased by radiation. However, B-DIM abrogated the radiation-induced AR increased expression and trafficking to the nucleus, which was consistent with decreased PSA secretion. In vivo, treatment of PC-3 prostate tumors in nude mice with B-DIM and radiation resulted in significant primary tumor growth inhibition and control of metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes. These studies demonstrate that B-DIM augments radiation-induced cell killing and tumor growth inhibition. B-DIM impairs critical survival signaling pathways activated by radiation, leading to enhanced cell killing. These novel observations suggest that B-DIM could be used as a safe compound to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy for castrate-resistant PCa.",

Sleep start was later and actual sleep time was shorter during the half dose and stop weeks compared to the treatment weeks. Sleep efficiency deteriorated in the stop week. Dim Light Melatonin Onset was earlier after treatment, but this effect disappeared after the stop week. In addition to the effects on sleep, results from questionnaires completed by parents showed that melatonin treatment also had positive effects on children's health and behavior problems and parenting stress. While health deteriorated after treatment discontinuation, the effects on behavior problems and parenting stress remained. Behavior problems at baseline did not influence the effect of melatonin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that complete termination of treatment after 4 weeks of melatonin use was too early. However, clinicians may advise a lower dose after a successful treatment trial of several weeks.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence provide credible support in favor of the potential role of bioactive products derived from ingesting cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussel sprouts, cauliflower and cabbage. Among many compounds, 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) is generated in the acidic environment of the stomach following dimerization of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) monomers present in these classes of vegetables. Both I3C and DIM have been investigated for their use in preventing, inhibiting, and reversing the progression of cancer - as a chemopreventive agent. In this review, we summarize an updated, wide-ranging pleiotropic anti-tumor and biological effects elicited by DIM against tumor cells. It is unfeasible to point one single target as basis of cellular target of action of DIM. We emphasize key cellular and molecular events that are effectively modulated in the direction of inducing apoptosis and suppressing cell proliferation. Collectively, DIM orchestrates signaling through Ah receptor, NF-κB/Wnt/Akt/mTOR pathways impinging on cell cycle arrest, modulation of key cytochrome P450 enzymes, altering angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and epigenetic behavior of cancer cells. The ability of DIM to selectively induce tumor cells to undergo apoptosis has been observed in preclinical models, and thus it has been speculated in improving the therapeutic efficacy of other anticancer agents that have diverse molecular targets. Consequently, DIM has moved through preclinical development into Phase I clinical trials, thereby suggesting that DIM could be a promising and novel agent either alone or as an adjunct to conventional therapeutics such as chemo-radio and targeted therapies. An important development has been the availability of DIM formulation with superior bioavailability for humans. Therefore, DIM appears to be a promising chemopreventive agent or chemo-radio-sensitizer for the prevention of tumor recurrence and/or for the treatment of human malignancies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Predicting the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy would be of clinical value in patients (pts) with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). We tested the hypothesis that circulating endothelial cell (CEC), bone marrow-derived CD45(dim)CD34(+)VEGFR2(+) progenitor cell or plasma angiogenic factor levels are associated with clinical outcome in mRCC pts undergoing treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). METHODS: Fifty-five mRCC pts were prospectively monitored at baseline (day 1) and day 14 during treatment (46 pts received sunitinib and 9 pts received sorafenib). Circulating endothelial cells (CD45(-)CD31(+)CD146(+)7-amino-actinomycin (7AAD)(-) cells) were measured in 1 ml whole blood using four-color flow cytometry (FCM). Circulating CD45(dim)CD34(+)VEGFR2(+)7AAD(-) progenitor cells were measured in progenitor-enriched fractions by four-color FCM. Plasma VEGF, sVEGFR2, SDF-1α and sVCAM-1 levels were determined by ELISA. Correlations between baseline CEC, CD45(dim)CD34(+)VEGFR2(+)7AAD(-) progenitor cells, plasma factors, as well as day 1-day 14 changes in CEC, CD45(dim)CD34(+)VEGFR2(+)7AAD(-) progenitor, plasma factor levels, and response to TKI, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined. RESULTS: No significant correlation between markers and response to TKI was observed. No association between baseline CEC, plasma VEGF, sVEGFR-2, SDF-1α, sVCAM-1 levels with PFS and OS was observed. However, baseline CD45(dim)CD34(+)VEGFR2(+)7AAD(-) progenitor cell levels were associated with PFS (P=0.01) and OS (P=0.006). Changes in this population and in SDF-1α levels between day 1 and day 14 were associated with PFS (P=0.03, P=0.002). Changes in VEGF and SDF-1α levels were associated with OS (P=0.02, P=0.007). CONCLUSION: Monitoring CD45(dim)CD34(+)VEGFR2(+) progenitor cells, plasma VEGF and SDF-1α levels could be of clinical interest in TKI-treated mRCC pts to predict outcome.",
