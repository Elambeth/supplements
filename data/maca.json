      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Compare the remineralization efficiency of Ginger, Ashwaghanda and Maca dentifrices versus commercially fluoride containing dentifrice. METHODS: Ginger, Ashwaghanda and Maca extracts were prepared by solvent extraction methodology and were characterized using transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. The pH of the dentifrices was evaluated by pH meter. Eighty teeth were collected and divided into five groups according to the treatment protocol. Enamel morphology was carried out by scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy for the analysis of calcium, phosphorus, Ca/P ratio and carbon. Surface microhardness was evaluated by Vickers micro-hardness tester. Data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Characterization results showed the highest calcium, phosphorus and fluoride ion release were associated to Maca, Ashwaganda and Ginger respectively. The pH results revealed that Ginger dentifrice exhibited the most alkaline pH, whereas Ashwaganda dentifrice exhibited the most acidic pH. Morphological analysis revealed that Ashwaganda showed lower remineralization ability compared to the other treated groups. Maca showed significant higher Ca/P ratio compared to other groups (p < 0.001) and Ginger showed significant higher surface microhardness recovery compared to Ashwaganda (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Ginger and Maca are promising remineralizing agents."

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and treatment-resistant forms of brain cancer. Current therapeutic strategies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, often fail due to the tumor's ability to develop resistance. The proteins YAP-1 (Yes-associated protein 1) and PARP-1 (Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1) have been implicated in this resistance, playing crucial roles in cell proliferation and DNA repair mechanisms, respectively. This study explored the inhibitory potential of natural compounds from Lepidium meyenii (Peruvian Maca) on the YAP-1 and PARP-1 protein systems to develop novel therapeutic strategies for GBM. By molecular dynamics simulations, we identified N-(3-Methoxybenzyl)-(9Z,12Z,15Z)- octadecatrienamide (DK5) as the most promising natural inhibitor for PARP-1 and stearic acid (GK4) for YAP-1. Although synthetic inhibitors, such as Olaparib (ODK) for PARP-1 and Verteporfin (VER) for YAP-1, only VER was superior to the naturally occurring molecule and proved a promising alternative. In conclusion, natural compounds from Lepidium meyenii (Peruvian Maca) offer a potentially innovative approach to improve GBM treatment, complementing existing therapies with their inhibitory action on PARP-1 and YAP-1."

Fingerprinting by HPLC-MS and PCA analysis showed compositional differences in glucosinolates, amides, macamides, and other alkaloids, which varied based on the color and the size of hypocotyls. These phytochemical differences translated into a higher antioxidant potential of red maca than black maca samples. The greatest COX-2 inhibition was demonstrated with a combination of red maca: saw palmetto (67%:33%) and red maca: saw palmetto: black maca (25%:50%:25%). The LNCaP androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line was the most sensitive to the three-component mixture of black, red maca, and saw palmetto treatment. This combination provided the most abundant set of high-activity metabolites, and is worthy of consideration in further clinical applications and future in-depth study.",

      "abstract": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) can induce serious liver toxicity in human. While completely avoiding AFB1 exposure is difficult, dietary intake of natural products may be leveraged to mitigate its adverse health effects. The roots of Lepidium meyenii (Maca) is rich in beneficial polysaccharides. Here we first evaluated dietary safety of MPs and then investigated MPs mitigating effects on the liver toxicity of AFB1. A 28-day sub-acute administration of Maca polysaccharides (MPs) demonstrated to be safe in mice at dose 0.2-1.2 g/kg.bw/day that significantly elevated mice stamina. Also, no toxicity was observed in human PC12 cells treated with MPs 25-100 μg/mL which successfully alleviated cobalt-caused cell apoptosis by ∼20%. In terms of anti-AFB1 hepatoxicity function, MPs 0.4-1.6 g/kg.bw/day significantly alleviated liver tissue damage, lipid accumulation, ROS damage, NF-κB p65, secretion of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in AFB1-treated mice. Flow cytometry found that MPs treatment recovered the elevation of F4/80 in the primary macrophages of AFB1-treated mice. At molecular level, MPs treatment activated liver NRF-2/GPX/SOD anti-oxidant system. In human macrophage model, MPs restored the inflammatory AhR/STAT3 pathway and mRNA expressions of Tnf-a, Inos, Arg-1 disrupted by AFB1. Our findings not only add to the current understanding on the toxicity mechanism of AFB1, but also provide references to the development of dietary intervention strategy using MPs.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common and debilitating condition for which effective treatments are needed. Lepidium meyenii Walp (Maca) is a plant with potential medicinal effects in treating depression. Recently, there has been growing interest in plant-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) due to their low toxicity and ability to transport to human cells. Targeting the gut-brain axis, a novel strategy for depression management, may be achieved through the use of Maca-derived EVs (Maca-EVs). In this study, we successfully isolated Maca-EVs using gradient ultracentrifugation and characterized their shape, size, and markers (CD63 and TSG101). The in vivo imaging showed that the Dil-labeled Maca-EVs crossed the brain-blood barrier and accumulated in the brain. The behavioral tests revealed that Maca-EVs dramatically recovered the depression-like behaviors of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) mice. UCMS mice fecal were characterized by an elevated abundance of g_Enterococcus, g_Lactobacillus, and g_Escherichia_Shigella, which were significantly restored by administration of Maca-EVs. The effects of Maca-EVs on the altered microbial and fecal metabolites in UCMS mice were mapped to biotin, pyrimidine, and amino acid (tyrosine, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate) metabolisms, which were closely associated with the serotonin (5-HT) production. Maca-EVs were able to increase serum monoamine neurotransmitter levels in UCMS mice, with 5-HT showing the most significant changes. We further demonstrated that 5-HT improved the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a key regulator of neuronal plasticity, and its subsequent activation of TrkB/p-AKT signaling by regulating the GTP-Cdc42/ERK pathway. These findings suggest that Maca-EVs enhance 5-HT release, possibly by modulating the gut-brain axis, to improve depression behavior. Our study sheds light on a novel approach to depression treatment using plant-derived EVs."

Due to the high radio-sensitivity of testicular tissues, radiation therapy may affect spermatogenesis, which may result in infertility. Hence, in this study testicular damage model is constructed to investigate the mitigation effect of Maca root powder and its potential radioprotective activity through both oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses, besides the apoptotic pathway. METHODS: Male albino rats were exposed to 6Gy of whole-body gamma radiation single dose. Maca root powder (1 g/kg b.wt./day, by oral gavage) was administered for a week before irradiation, then d-galactose (300 mg/kg, by oral gavage) and Maca daily for another week. RESULTS: Gamma radiation and d-galactose revealed a significant decrease in serum testosterone, sperm count, and motility and higher percentage of the sperm head abnormality, while Maca root treatment maintained all sperm morphology parameters. Maca root treatment demonstrated a notable defense against radiation-induced oxidative stress and ameliorated malonaldehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) levels, reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the ratio of GSH/GSSG in testis tissues. Exposure to gamma rays and d-galactose displayed a significant elevation in GRP78, CHOP, total caspase-3 as well as active (cleaved) caspase-3 levels, whereas treatment with Maca significantly reduced the ER and apoptotic markers levels. Also, Maca improved the histological changes of the disorganized seminiferous tubules induced by irradiation. CONCLUSION: Our findings show for the first time that Maca has a protective effect on male reproductive damage induced by radiotherapy. Maca root reveals anti-apoptotic effect and protection against testicular damage via GRP78/CHOP/caspase-3 pathway."

The aim of this study was to evaluate, for the first time, the potential beneficial effects of oral Maca (Lepidium meyenii or Lepidium peruvianum) supplementation in improving reproductive performance in male dogs. Forty-eight male dogs of different breeds were enrolled in the study, fed the same maintenance diet, and exposed to the same environmental conditions. The subjects were divided into four groups of 12 dogs each: Subfertile treatment group, Subfertile control group, Normofertile treatment group, and Normofertile control group. The dogs in the treatment groups received Lepidium meyenii in their diet in a capsule formulation [75 mg/kg Maca extract 10:1, thickening agent (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), ground rice], while the control groups received placebo capsule (starch). For each subject included in the study, the spermiogram was analyzed at three time points of the sperm cycle: at day 0 (T0), day 31 (T31), and day 62 (T62). Dietary supplementation with Maca in subfertile subjects resulted in a significant increase in ejaculate volume and total sperm count compared to the control group. This increase was also observed in normofertile subjects in the treatment group. In addition, total and progressive motility as well as sperm morphology were significantly improved in the groups treated with Maca compared to the control groups. The results thus highlight, for the first time, the potential efficacy of supplementation with 75 mg/kg of Maca extract daily in improving semen quality in dogs."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Maca root (Lepidium meyenii Walp.) is a Peruvian plant of the Brassicaceae family. Maca roots are popular food supplements used to treat a variety of ailments described traditionally as enhancing metabolic and health conditions. AIM OF THE STUDY: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been the real scourge globally, affecting more than one-fourth of the global population. MetS causes the development of multi-organ illnesses, including altered blood cholesterol and sugar levels, oxidative stress, and hypertension. This study evaluated maca root total methanolic extract (MTE) as a potential nutraceutical to manage the complications of MetS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the first 4 weeks of a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet (HFCD), streptozotocin (STZ) was injected in Wistar rats to induce the MetS model. Animals were treated orally with MTE at 100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg for 4 weeks compared to metformin at 200 mg/kg after confirmation of diabetes. RESULTS: One month of MTE supplementation in HFCD-fed rats remarkably decreased the elevation of blood glucose and lipids, improved liver function and insulin resistance, additionally it successfully restored the state of inflammatory and oxidative stress. The extract was standardized to contain total phenolics equal to 24.45 ± 0.96 μg Gallic acid/mg extract. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MTE improves MetS by reducing hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress. While also improving beta cell secretory functions, implying that MTE could be used as a balancing drug in the prevention and treatment of metabolic abnormalities linked to type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Maca is a functional food with anti-inflammatory activity, and it is rich in protein. Currently, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common gastrointestinal disease. However, there is little research focusing on the effect of maca protein (MCP) on IBD. In this study, we extracted MCP from maca root and explored its effect and mechanism on improving dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced IBD in mice. The results indicated that MCP intervention alleviated the clinical symptoms and colon tissue damage of mice with DSS-induced colitis and inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors. Moreover, it can modulate the gut microbiota composition in mice with DSS-induced colitis. The regulation is achieved by reducing the relative abundance of the IBD-exacerbating key bacterial genera: Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio, Prevotella, Helicobacter and Sutterella, while increasing the relative abundance of the IBD-alleviating key bacterial genera: norank_f_Muribaculaceae, Lactobacillus, Oscillospira, Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium. MCP can also promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The further western blotting results indicated that MCP can regulate the Treg/Th17 immune balance in mice with colitis via the SCFAs-GPR41/43/HDAC1 signaling pathway. Overall, MCP can alleviate colitis by comprehensively regulating the gut microbiota and inflammatory response. It may be a promising functional component that reduces the risk of colitis by maintaining intestinal health.",

      "abstract": "In our previous studies, we used a graded alcohol precipitation method to extract four maca polysaccharide components (MCP1, MCP2, MCP3, and MCP4) from maca with various molecular weights. Compared to other three components, MCP2 had stronger immunoregulatory abilities on CD4+T cells. To avoid the immunosuppressive effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), maca polysaccharides in combination with 5-FU treatment were investigated in this study. The results show that 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg MCP2 could significantly delay the growth of tumor and enhance the anti-tumor effect of 5-FU in vivo. Furthermore, MCP2 can partly recover the proliferation of CD4+T cells after being suppressed by 5-FU in vitro. Additionally, in order to explore the mechanism in which MCP2 acts on CD4+T cells, the MCP2 is marked with FITC fluorescence and synthesis MCP2-Tyr-FITC for the first time. Confocal microscope results show that MCP2-Tyr-FITC can directly bind to the surface of CD4+T cells. Together, our work demonstrates that maca polysaccharides could enhance the anti-tumor effect when combined with 5-FU by regulating CD4+T cells, suggesting a novel potential immunomodulator in tumor therapy."

      "abstract": "Testicular dysfunction (TDF) is characterized by testosterone deficiency and is caused by oxidative stress injury in Leydig cells. A natural fatty amide named N-benzylhexadecanamide (NBH), derived from cruciferous maca, has been shown to promote testosterone production. Our study aims to reveal the anti-TDF effect of NBH and explore its potential mechanism in vitro. This study examined the effects of H2O2 on cell viability and testosterone levels in mouse Leydig cells (TM3) under oxidative stress. In addition, cell metabolomics analysis based on UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS/MS showed that NBH was mainly involved in arginine biosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, the TCA cycle and other metabolic pathways by affecting 23 differential metabolites, including arginine and phenylalanine. Furthermore, we also performed network pharmacological analysis to observe the key protein targets in NBH treatment. The results showed that its role was to up-regulate ALOX5, down-regulate CYP1A2, and play a role in promoting testicular activity by participating in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway. In summary, our study not only provides new insights into the biochemical mechanisms of natural compounds in the treatment of TDF, but also provides a research strategy that integrates cell metabolomics and network pharmacology in order to promote the screening of new drugs for the treatment of TDF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In medicinal plants, selection, reproduction and preservation of important genotypes are very necessary. Nowadays, using tissue culture and regeneration techniques of medicinal plants under in vitro conditions has been able to proliferate medicinal plants widely, which is much higher than traditional methods of vegetative propagation. Maca (Lepidium meyenii), is an industrial plant whose root is the usable part. Maca has valuable medicinal effects such as sexual enhancement and reproductive power, infertility treatment, improved sperm count and quality, anti-stress, osteoporosis prevention and more. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was conducted to induce callus and regeneration of Maca. First, MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of Kinetin, Naphthaleneacetic acid and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [0.5, 1 and 2 µM respectively] and control were compared for callus induction from root and leaves. After 38 days of incubation, the first callus appeared, after 50 days of callus induction and after 79 days regeneration occurred. The callus induction experiment was performed for the study of the effect of three explants (leaf, stem and root) and seven hormone levels. The regeneration experiment was carried out by studying the effect of three explants (leaf, stem and root) on eight levels of the hormone. The results of data analysis on callus induction showed that the effects of explants, hormones and their interactions on callus induction percentage were highly significant but not significant on callus growth rate. The results of regression analysis showed that explants, hormones and their interactions had no significant effect on regeneration percentage. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, the best medium for inducing callus was Hormone 2,4-D [2 µM] and Kinetin [0.5 µM], in which the highest percentage of callus induction was in leaf explants (62%). And the lowest were in stem (30%) and root (27%) explants. According to the comparison of the mean, the best environment for regeneration of the environment was 4 µM 6-Benzylaminopurine 2.5 + Thidiazuron, in which the highest percentage of regeneration was in leaf explant (87%) and stem (69%) and the lowest in root explant (12). %).",

      "abstract": "A growing number of nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals have been utilized for millennia as anti-fatigue supplements in folk medicine. However, the anti-fatigue mechanism underlying is still far from being clearly explained. The aim of the study is to explore the underlying mechanism of the Maca compound preparation (MCP), a prescription for management of exercise-induced fatigue. In this study, mice weight-loaded swimming test was used to evaluate the anti-fatigue effect of MCP. MCP significantly improved the forelimb grip strength and Rota-rod test in behavioral tests via regulating energy metabolism. 16S rDNA sequencing results showed MCP can regulate the intestinal flora at the genus level by increasing several beneficial bacteria (i.e., Lactobacillus, Akkermansia and etc.), and decreasing the harmful bacteria (i.e., Candidatus_Planktophila and Candidatus_Arthromitus), where notable high relevance was observed between the fatigue-related biomarkers and fecal microbiota. The results of microbial function analysis suggested that MCP might improve exercise-induced fatigue by enhancing energy metabolism, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides and breakdown of amino acid metabolism. In addition, and H2O2-induced oxidative stress model on C2C12 cells was employed to further validate the regulation of MCP on energy metabolisms. MCP pre-treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS accumulation, and increased glycogen content, ATP generation capacity and mitochondrial membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells, as well as conferred anti-cell necrosis ability. In conclusion, MCP plays a key role in regulating fatigue occurrence in exercising and gut microbiota balance, which may be of particular importance in the case of manual workers or sub-healthy populations."

Maca is a common medicinal plant with important biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fatigue, and neuroprotective effects. The present research explored the alleged protective role of Maca extract in alleviating the adverse impact of HS on rabbits. Growing V-line 6-week-old buck rabbits (N = 48) were orally administered Maca extract at levels of 0 (MAC0), 200 (MAC2), 400 (MAC4), or 600 (MAC6) mg/head twice per week. Compared to the control groups, rabbits provided Maca had better growth performance, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. Liver and tests weights were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in Maca treated groups compared to the control. hemoglobin, white blood cell, red blood corpuscles, platelet count, hematocrit, and lymphocytes were significantly increased in the MAC4 group compared with the control group. MAC4 treatment significantly reduced aspartate aminotransferase and malondialdehyde levels compared with other groups. Moreover, the concentrations of total bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were lower (p < 0.05) in the MAC4 group than in the controls. Oral administration of Maca improved cortisol and testosterone values, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide dismutase. The MAC4 group exhibited significant improvement (p < 0.05) in sperm motility, survival, membrane functionality, concentration, and libido, with a significant decrease in abnormal sperm compared with the control group. Also, aforementioned group showed sperm cells with a normal structure and intact plasma membranes, acrosomes, and well-organised axonemal components. Histopathological screening of liver sections showed moderate to severe degenerative and necrotic changes in rabbits exposed to HS, which were alleviated with Maca oral administration. In conclusion, oral administration of Maca extract at 400 or 600 mg/head-weekly enhanced growth performance, hemato-biochemical attributes, antioxidant status, and semen quality in rabbits during the hot season.",

The most notable feature of Maca is its potent antioxidant capacity, which helps in the scavenging of free radicals and protection of cells from oxidative stress. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effect of Maca extract on thawed sperm cells from bulls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three dilutions of 1, 10, and 100 mg/mL of Maca extract were incubated with frozen-thawed bovine semen and analyzed at 1, 3, and 24 h of exposure time, evaluating the activity of the extract on the DNA, motility, morphology, viability, integrity of the membrane and acrosome of spermatozoa. RESULTS: The Maca extract improved the studied sperm parameters of motility, acrosome integrity, vitality, and DNA integrity of sperm cells at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, and at 1 mg/mL, an improvement was observed in the morphology and integrity of the membrane. However, the best activity of the Maca extract was observed on the DNA integrity of the sperm, which was effective at the three concentrations evaluated after 24 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that L. meyenii can help in maintaining spermatozoa cellular integrity after the frozen-thaw process, especially in the protection against DNA fragmentation. Therefore, Maca would be a feasible supplementation to protect sperm to maintain their fertile ability after thawing."

The study aims to identify its phytochemical composition using UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS, and evaluate its effects on acrylamide-induced oxidative stress. The lyophilized aqueous extract of red maca (LAqE-RM) was orally administered in doses of 1 and 2 g/kg body weight for 4 weeks. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in erythrocytes, brain, and liver, as well as hepatic levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined. Administration of acrylamide for 2 and 4 weeks significantly increased (p < 0.001) MDA levels in erythrocytes, brain, and liver. However, LAqE-RM prevented (p < 0.001) an increase in MDA levels in all tissues studied. Likewise, the groups treated with LAqE-RM presented significantly (p < 0.001) lower levels of ALT and AST compared to the control. Treatment with LAqE-RM ameliorated the acrylamide-induced oxidative stress by reducing MDA levels in erythrocytes, brain, and liver and by lowering liver levels of ALT and AST in a dose-dependent manner. Twenty-five secondary metabolites were identified and characterized from LAqE-RM based on UHPLC mass spectrophotometry. These include carbolines, alkamides, fatty acids, and macamides, which are probably involved in their antioxidant protective role.",

      "abstract": "Antioxidant supplementation has been proposed as a new strategy to improve the long-term preservation of semen. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Maca supplementation of semen extender on quality-related canine semen parameters during cooling. Ejaculates from nine dogs were cooled for 7 days in the absence (control group) or in the presence of 10, 20 and 50 μL/mL of an aqueous extract of Maca. Sperm were evaluated for sperm viability, motility, DNA fragmentation and lipid peroxidation after 3 h, 24 h, 4 days and 7 days of storage. The addition of 10 μL/mL of Maca preserved sperm DNA and plasma membrane integrity at 3 h and increased sperm curvilinear velocity after 24 h. Treatment with 20 and 50 μL/mL of Maca increased the percentage of hyperactivated sperm after 3 h. Moreover, semen treated with 20 μL/mL of Maca decreased lipid peroxidation at 24 h. A significant reduction of sperm DNA and plasma membrane integrity as well as of kinetics parameters between 3 and 24 h of refrigerated storage with the higher concentration tested was observed. Although Maca was not able to protect canine semen with extended refrigeration storage time, it increased hyperactivation and preserved DNA integrity in short-term storage."

      "abstract": "Long-term body fatigue poses a threat to human health. To explore novel sources of antifatigue medicine and food, we developed a novel formula composed of wolfberry, figs, white lentils, raspberries, and maca (WFWRM) according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we explored whether the administration of the WFWRM relieves fatigue. Thirty male Kunming mice were divided into three groups, which received either intragastric administration of saline, vitamin C (100 mg/kg), or WFWRM (1.00 g/kg) every day. After 30 days of treatment, all mice exhaustively performed weight-bearing swimming. Another ten mice that did not perform swimming were treated with saline for 30 days and used as sedentary control. The antifatigue effect and biochemical oxidation phenomena were assessed in the exercise-exhausted model and sedentary controls. The histopathological changes in the liver and kidney tissues of mice were observed by performing hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. After 30 days of oral administration, the liver and kidney tissues of mice were healthy and show no pathological changes. Compared to the fatigue model group, WFWRM significantly increased the rota-rod time of the mice. Also, the concentrations of lactic acid (LA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the WFWRM group significantly reduced. On the contrary, the levels of hepatic glycogen (LG), muscle glycogen (MG), and serum glucose (GLU) increased in the WFWRM group. Besides, WFWRM markedly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) but increased the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the concentrations of the sources of energy (LG, MG, and GLU) significantly correlated with those of metabolites (BLA, BUN, CK, and LDH) and antioxidant levels (SOD, GSH-PX, and MDA). Overall, our results suggested that the supplementation of WFWRM could improve exercise capacity and relieve fatigue probably by normalizing energy metabolism and attenuating oxidation."

METHODS: A mouse aging model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (D-gal), and pathological changes in the hippocampal ultrastructure were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain tissues were evaluated with GSH-Px and MDA assay kits. An MTT assay was used to detect the viability of the model SH-SY5Y cells with H2O2-induced damage, and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) kit was used to evaluate LDH leakage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cell cycle arrest were analyzed by flow cytometry, and cleaved caspase 3 and P53 protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Demonstrated that MP increased GSH-Px activity, reduced MDA levels, and attenuated the cell damage induced by H2O2. Furthermore, MP protected neuronal cells from oxidative stress through a mechanism including a decrease in LDH leakage and reversal of H2O2-induced cell morphological damage. MP treatment alleviated the H2O2-induced increases in ROS levels, inhibited apoptosis, relieved cell cycle arrest, and downregulated cleaved caspase 3 and P53 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: MP is a novel antioxidant with neuroprotective effects.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experimental study was carried out on 35 BALB/c mice. Treatment was applied topically on the dorsum of the animals, which were subsequently irradiated with ultraviolet B rays, and then we measured the thickness in microns (μm) of histological samples of the skin of the mice. Seven groups were assigned, divided into non-irradiated: Blank (G1) and irradiated with UV light: no treatment (G2); with commercial sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 30 (G3); cream (placebo) (G4); LEM at 15% in water (G5); LEM cream at 5% (G6); and LEM cream at 15% (G7). In vitro SPF was determined using the Mansur method. Absorbance readings were taken in an ultraviolet- visible spectrophotometer (UV-VIS) and SPFs were determined for the following formulations: LEM cream at 5%, benzophenone-4 (BZF-4) and commercial sunscreen SPF 30. RESULTS: Mouse skin thickness in microns (μm) was 27.28 in G2; 18.31 in G3; 27.33 in G4; 19.51 in G5 and 18.04 in G6. There was no significant difference between the group not exposed to radiation (G1) and the 15% LEM cream group (G7), both had the lowest thicknesses (12.76 and 14.20 μm, respectively). The SPF of LEM cream at 15% was 5.480 ± 0.020. CONCLUSIONS: The formulation with LEM cream showed photoprotective activity against UV irradiation, alkaloids were the phytochemical components mostly found and the formulation was compatible with the active principle (LEM).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Phytoestrogens are traditionally used for cardiovascular risks but direct effects on the ischemic heart remain unclear. Plants with phytoestrogens are used for reducing menopausic symptoms and they could also be cardioprotectives. Here we investigated whether maca (Lepidium meyenii) contains isoflavones and prevents cardiac stunning, in comparison to soy isoflavones. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Both products were orally and daily administered to rats during 1 week before exposing isolated hearts to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Young male (YM), female (YF) and aged female (AgF) rats treated with maca (MACA, 1 g/kg/day) or soy isoflavones (ISOF, 100 mg/kg/day) were compared to acute daidzein (DAZ, 5 mg/kg i.p.) and non-treated rat groups. Isolated ventricles were perfused inside a calorimeter to simultaneously measure contractile and calorimetrical signals before and during I/R. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Maca has genistein and daidzein. MACA and ISOF improved the post-ischemic contractile recovery (PICR) and muscle economy (P/Ht) in YM and YF hearts, but not in AgF hearts. DAZ improved PICR and P/Ht more in YM than in YF. The mKATP channels blockade reduced both PICR and P/Ht in DAZ-treated YM hearts, without affecting them in ISOF or MACA-treated YM hearts. In MACA treated YF hearts, the simultaneous blockade of NOS and mKATP channels, or the mNCX blockade reduced cardioprotection. Results show that subacute oral treatment with maca or with soy isoflavones was strongly preventive of cardiac ischemic dysfunction, more than the acute administration of a pure isoflavone (daidzein, genistein). Maca induced synergistic and complex mechanisms which prevented mitochondrial calcium overload."

      "abstract": "Drug-based treatment of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) with benzimidazoles is in most cases non-curative, thus has to be taken lifelong. Here, we report on a 56-year-old male AE patient who received standard benzimidazole treatment and biliary plastic stents, and additionally self-medicated himself with the Peruvian plant extract Maca (Lepidium meyenii). After 42 months, viable parasite tissue had disappeared. Based on this striking observation, the anti-echinococcal activity of Maca was investigated in vitro and in mice experimentally infected with Echinococcus multilocularis metacestodes. Albendazole (ABZ)-treated mice and mice treated with an ABZ+Maca combination exhibited a significantly reduced parasite burden compared to untreated or Maca-treated mice. As shown by a newly established UHPLC-MS/MS-based measurement of ABZ-metabolites, the presence of Maca during the treatment did not alter ABZ plasma levels. In vitro assays corroborated these findings, as exposure to Maca had no notable effect on E. multilocularis metacestodes, and in cultures of germinal layer cells, possibly unspecific, cytotoxic effects of Maca were observed. However, in the combined treatments, Maca inhibited the activity of ABZ in vitro. While Maca had no direct anti-parasitic activity, it induced in vitro proliferation of murine spleen cells, suggesting that immunomodulatory properties could have contributed to the curative effect seen in the patient."

      "abstract": "Maca (Lepidium meyenii Walp.) has emerged as a popular functional plant food due to its various pharmacological properties, including anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and anti-fatigue activity. In this study, we investigated the role of Maca aqueous extract (ME) on muscle during exercise-induced fatigue both in vivo and in vitro. As a result, ME significantly enhanced mouse leg grip-strength and increased exercise endurance in the rota-rod test. ME could clear the accumulation of metabolites - blood lactic acid (BLA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels after weight-loaded forced swimming. Focusing on muscle, we found that the administration of ME strengthened mouse muscle structures so that exercise-induced metabolic stress was alleviated by upregulating NAD+/NADH. Furthermore, ME inhibited the reduction of the viability and accumulation of ROS by treatment with H2O2 in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. ME-induced activation of energy metabolism in skeletal muscle might up-regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function, thereby protecting against oxidative stress-induced damage. We concluded that the effects of Maca played a crucial role in the regulation of exercise-induced fatigue in mouse muscle, which could be expected to serve as a functional food supplement for improving exercise performance and alleviating physical fatigue.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether pre-treatment with maca (Lepidium meyenii Walp) improved the tolerance to high altitude on an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model at sea level. METHOD: The animals were treated with 17β-estradiol (200 µg/kg; E2), red and black maca (1.5 g/kg) for 28 days and exposed at high altitude or sea level. RESULT: Our findings showed that red and black maca extracts significantly (P < .001) reduced the MDA level in OVX rat serum under hypoxia in a similar way to E2. Red and black maca extracts had similar effects with E2, by significantly (P < .001) reversing and increasing the ovariectomized induced decrease in cornified endometrial cell number. Under hypoxic conditions, the black maca (P < .05) and E2 (P < .01) increased the uterine weight in OVX rats. Finally, E2 alone significantly recovered the frequency of the uterine contractile response. CONCLUSION: Aqueous extract of L. meyenii partially protects the reproductive function in hypobaric hypoxic environment, through the recovery of the cornified endometrial cells and uterine weight in a menopausal model of OVX rats."

The antioxidant activity of Maca crude extract (MCE), total macamides (TMM) and total macaenes (TME) was evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging, ABTS radical scavenging and reducing power. The ability of MCE, TMM and TME against multiple cancer cell lines (leukemia HL-60, lung cancer A549, liver cancer SMMC-7721, breast cancer MCF-7, and colon cancer SW480) was used to evaluate their anticancer activity. The results demonstrate that TMM has the best free radical scavenging ability and reducing power compared to MCE, TME, and TMM, TME has the weakest antioxidant capacity compared to them. The difference in antioxidant properties between TMM and TME may be caused by benzylated alkamide in the chemical structure. TMM also has a good inhibitory effect on the five cancer cells. N-benzyl-(9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-octadecatrienamide (NBot) is the most cytotoxicity inhibitory of the macamides tested. The inhibitory effect of N-benzyl-9Z, 12Z-octadecadienamide (NBod) on colon cancer SW480 is near that of control group, while the inhibitory rates of NBot on leukemia HL-60, lung cancer A549, liver cancer SMMC-7721, and breast cancer MCF-7 are near those of the control group. Hence, NBot can be considered to have great potential as a natural drug with high efficiency and low side effects for cancer therapy.",

Finasteride (F), a 5a-reductase inhibitor, is the standard treatment for BPH reducing prostate weight but also sexual desire. The Peruvian plant known as Red Maca (RM) (Lepidium meyenii) inhibits BPH in rats and mice. The aim of the study was to assess the inflammatory effect of RM and finasteride in rats with testosterone enanthate (TE)-induced BPH. Thirty rats were divided into 5 groups: Control, TE (50 mg/rat), TE + F (0.6 mg/kg), and two groups of TE + RM 40/80 (40 or 80 mg). After treatments, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), interleukin 4 (IL4) and interferon gamma (INFg) as well as testosterone and oestradiol were evaluated and inflammatory cells (neutrophils, mast cells and lymphocytes) in prostate were quantified. Red Maca and finasteride treatments decreased inflammatory cells counts in prostate, inhibiting TNFa by different pathways. Finasteride increased IL4 whereas Red Maca increased INFg. In conclusion, data suggest that finasteride acts on Th2 response by increasing IL4 in prostate, while Red Maca acts on Th1 response mediated by INFg.",

For fertile couples, the chance of getting pregnant is 57% in three months of attempts, 75% in six months, 90% in one year, and 95% in two years. One-third of infertile couples have more than one cause involved in their inability to conceive. In 10-20% of cases, the reason for infertility cannot be determined. Approximately 25% of infertile women have ovulatory dysfunction. Objectives:This research investigates improvements on the fertility of couples following treatment with a daily tablet of the patented blend consisting in a combination of Vitex agnus-castus (Vitex) extract, Lepidium meyenii (Maca) extract and active folate alone or with a gel capsule of vitamin, minerals, oligo-elements plus DHA and EPA Omega 3 fatty acids. Materials and methods:Multicenter prospective interventional study with a duration of 18 months, conducted between June 2016 and December 2017. A total of 189 women were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to two treatment groups: group A, consisting of 103 patients who received a daily tablet of the patented blend consisting in a combination of Vitex extract, Maca extract and active folate, and group B, consisting of 86 patients who were given a daily tablet of the patented blend also administered to Group A and a gel capsule of vitamins, minerals, oligo-elements plus DHA and EPA omega 3 fatty acids. Paraclinical tests were conducted upon inclusion in the study and six months after treatment initiation in case of non-pregnancy. Every patient received ovulation kits and ovulation tests were performed on day 14 of the menstrual cycle. Outcomes:Average age of the women was 31.18 years (SD 5.18 years). There was a successful pregnancy rate of 37%, with no difference between the two arms of the study. The number of new pregnancies was relatively constant through the study duration. The number of women with ovulation increased from 10% to 42.9% by the end of the study. During the six-month-period of the study, there were no side effects reported between patients of the two groups. Conclusions:The supplement may be used by women trying to conceive. The patented blend consisting of a combination of Vitex, Maca and active folate regulates the menstrual cycle, stimulates ovulation and increases the likelihood of getting pregnant."

METHODS: The Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, including the control group (no swimming), the swimming group (free swimming), and 3 treatment groups treated with the maca extract at the doses of 4.0, 5.3 and 8.0 g/kg body weight. The animals in swimming and treatment groups were then for free swimming in the circulating water flow daily for 15 days. On the 16th day after swimming endurance, the spinal and muscular tissues were collected from all groups. The mitochondrial ultrastructures of the neurons of the spinal cells were observed with the projection electron microscope, and the levels of the glycogen, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and Ca2+ in muscle tissues were determined by the RIA method. RESULTS: When rats were treated with maca extract (at 4.0, 5.3, 8.0 g/kg body weight), the total swimming time and the swimming duration before sinking were increased by 19.83%, 60.28%, 77.55%, and 55.34%, 73.91%, 94.47%, respectively, compared with the simple swimming group(P<0.01), while the sinking times were decreased by 34.35%, 51.18% and 57.96%, compared with those of the swimming group. Also, the levels of SOD, GSH-Px, and muscle glycogen in three treatment groups were enhanced by 5.12%, 22.74%, 52.53%, 44.22%, 77.79%, 98.45%(P<0.01), and 35.08%, 47.83%,81.88% (P<0.01)respectively over the swimming rats without treatment, but the MDA content and the Ca2+ levels were reduced by 20.10%, 31.49% 38.72%, and 6.42%, 17.58%, 26.35%,compared with the simple swimming group(P<0.01). In addition, compared to the swimming group, the mitochondrial densities of volume (VD), surface (SD) and numbers (ND) of spinal nerve cells in rats treated with maca extract (4.0, 5.3, 8.0 g/kg body weight) were reduced by 7.79%, 18.18%, 31.17%, 16.95%, 27.34%, 43.31% and 13.51%, 23.19%, 43.15%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated the protective effects of maca extract on the mitochondria of spinal cell and suggested that maca extract could improve the muscle antioxidant activity by increasing the levels of SOD, GSH-Px, and muscle glycogen.",

      "abstract": "Maca (Lepidium meyenii Walpers) has been used as a dietary supplement and ethnomedicine for centuries. Recently, maca has become a high profile functional food worldwide because of its multiple biological activities. This study is the first explorative research to investigate the prevention and amelioration capacity of the aqueous extract of black maca (AEM) on high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFD)-induced metabolism disorder in golden hamsters and to identify the potential mechanisms involved in these effects. For 20 weeks, 6-week-old male golden hamsters were fed the following respective diets: (1) a standard diet, (2) HFD, (3) HFD supplemented with metformin, or (4) HFD supplemented with three doses of AEM (300, 600, or 1,200 mg/kg). After 20 weeks, the golden hamsters that received daily AEM supplementation presented with the beneficial effects of improved hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis in vivo. Based on the hepatic metabolomic analysis results, alterations in metabolites associated with pathological changes were examined. A total of 194 identified metabolites were mapped to 46 relative metabolic pathways, including those of energy metabolism. In addition, via in silico profiling for secondary maca metabolites by a joint pharmacophore- and structure-based approach, a compound-target-disease network was established. The results revealed that 32 bioactive compounds in maca targeted 16 proteins involved in metabolism disorder. Considering the combined metabolomics and virtual screening results, we employed quantitative real-time PCR assays to verify the gene expression of key enzymes in the relevant pathways. AEM promoted glycolysis and inhibited gluconeogenesis via regulating the expression of key genes such as Gck and Pfkm. Moreover, AEM upregulated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux by changing the concentrations of intermediates and increasing the mRNA levels of Aco2, Fh, and Mdh2. In addition, the lipid-lowering effects of AEM in boththe serum and liver may be partly related to PPARα signaling activation, including enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation and lipogenesis pathway inhibition. Together, our data demonstrated that AEM intervention significantly improved lipid and glucose metabolism disorder by regulating the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis-TCA cycle and by modulating gene expression levels involved in the PPARα signaling pathway."

Semen processing and extenders have been tested to improve the fertilizing capacity of semen and to preserve semen during transport. Dietary supplementation with natural antioxidants has been proposed to prevent oxidative damages. In this study, for the first time, the effect of dietary supplementation with Lepidium meyenii (Maca) on the characteristics of fresh and chilled stallion semen was evaluated. Maca is a traditional Andean crop used as a nutraceutical for the fertility-enhancing properties that are linked with antioxidant activity. The diet of five stallions was supplemented with 20 g of Maca powder daily for a total of 60 days. A control group of five stallions received the same diet without Maca. Semen was collected once before the administration of Maca (D0), twice during the administration at 30 and 60 days (D30 and D60), and finally twice at 30 and 60 days after the end of the administration (D90 and D120). Ejaculates were processed for cooled shipping at 5 °C and evaluated in the laboratory for total and progressive motility, acrosome integrity, and lipid peroxidation after collection and after 24, 48, and 72 h of storage. Dietary supplementation with Maca improved sperm concentration (from 213 ± 80.4 to 447 ± 73.1 × 106 spz/mL) and total sperm count (from 10,880 ± 4377 to 24,783 ± 4419 × 106 spz). The beneficial effects of Maca supplementation on motility and acrosome integrity in the raw semen were detected from the end of treatment with Maca (D60) until the end of the study (D120). Furthermore, during cooling storage, total motility, progressive motility, and acrosome integrity declined more slowly in the Maca-treated group than in the control group. Lipid peroxidation did not change during cooling storage in either group and did not show a significant difference between the two groups. In this study, the dietary supplementation with Maca increased sperm production and stabilized semen quality during chilled storage.",

Mice were assigned to six treatment groups: Vehicle control, CYP control, CYP plus oral Maca (500 or 1,000 mg/kg), and oral Maca (500 or 1,000 mg/kg). CYP was administered via the intraperitoneal route (days 1-2), while vehicle or Maca were administered daily for 28 days. On day 28, half of the animals in each group were either sacrificed or paired with age-matched females for fertility assessment. Plasma testosterone assay, sperm analysis and assessment of tissue antioxidant/morphological status were also carried out. CYP administration was associated with oxidative stress, subfertility and morphometric/morphological indices of gonadal injury, while administration of Maca mitigated CYP-induced gonadal toxicity and subfertility. This study shows that Maca is beneficial in the mitigation of CYP-induced male gonadal insufficiency and/or testicular morphological changes; however, further studies will be needed to ascertain its usability for this purpose in humans.",

Red maca (Lepidium meyenii), a plant from the Peruvian highlands, promotes skin wound healing at sea level and at high altitude in adult male mice. High Alt Med Biol 18:373-383, 2017.-Wound healing consists of three simultaneous phases: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Previous studies suggest that there is a delay in the healing process in high altitude, mainly due to alterations in the inflammatory phase. Maca (Lepidium meyenii) is a Peruvian plant with diverse biological properties, such as the ability to protect the skin from inflammatory lesions caused by ultraviolet radiation, as well as its antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of high altitude on tissue repair and the effect of the topical administration of the spray-dried extract of red maca (RM) in tissue repair. Studies were conducted in male Balb/c mice at sea level and high altitude. Lesions were inflicted through a 10 mm-diameter excisional wound in the skin dorsal surface. Treatments consisted of either (1) spray-dried RM extract or (2) vehicle (VH). Animals wounded at high altitude had a delayed healing rate and an increased wound width compared with those at sea level. Moreover, wounding at high altitude was associated with an increase in inflammatory cells. Treatment with RM accelerated wound closure, decreased the level of epidermal hyperplasia, and decreased the number of inflammatory cells at the wound site. In conclusion, RM at high altitude generate a positive effect on wound healing, decreasing the number of neutrophils and increasing the number of macrophages in the wound healing at day 7 postwounding. This phenomenon is not observed at sea level.",

The results revealed that the crude extract of Lipidium meyenii caused a significant decrease in the no. of writhes at 300 and 500mg/kg (p<0.05) as compare to control, Epimidium sagittatum and standard drug. The gross behavioral, open field, exploratory behaviour, forced swimming test for stress, diuretic activity, chronic toxicity with the effect on reproduction of both male and female and change in body weight were also studied. The phytochemical study showed the presence of tannin, alkaloid, carbohydrate, rich protein and absence of sterol in LM, whereas ES shows presence of sterol and less protein. LS improve in muscle activity and exploratory behaviours without any toxic effects on mice and their pups. It does not have diuretic effect for first two hour but act normally after initial phase of drug therapy. Epimidium sagittatum has dual action that is at low dose it has slight stimulation action and at high dose little depressive effect. ES also has some diuretic effect. Overall these results suggest that LM is highly effective remedy for treatment of impotency and reduces stress and depression, because of dual effect ES not only suggested as an anxiolytic medicine but also effective in female hormonal disorder.",

The physicochemical properties of MP were analyzed through high-performance gel filtration chromatography, IR, monosaccharide composition, methylation, GC-MS, and NMR analyses. The antifatigue effect of MP was evaluated by using a mouse weight-loaded swimming model. MP is an acidic heteropolysaccharide with an average molecular weight (Mw ) of 793.5 kDa. It is composed of D-GalA: D-Glc: L-Ara: D-Man: D-Gal: L-Rha = 35.07:29.98:16.98:13.01:4.21:0.75 (mol, %). The findings revealed that MP contained β-1,3-Galp(A), β-1,3-Glcp, and α-1, 3-Manp linked alternatingly to form a backbone (5:4:1). MP (above mid-dosage 50 mg/kg bw/d) could effectively elongate swimming durations and accelerate average swimming speeds (within the 1st 5 min) of mice (P < 0.05) and improve the serous biochemical parameters of mice. Compared with the control model, high-dosage (100 mg/kg bw/d) MP treatment could significantly enhance glutathione peroxidase and creatine kinase activities (P < 0.05) and decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity (P < 0.01). High-dosage MP could significantly reduce the levels of blood urea nitrogen, lactic acid, and malondialdehyde (P < 0.05).

The secondary metabolites of maca, namely, maca alkaloids, macaenes, and macamides, are bioactive compounds, but their targets are undefined. METHODS: The pharmacophore-based PharmaDB targets database screening joint the ligand shape similarity-based WEGA validation approach is proposed to predict the targets of these unique constituents and was performed using Discovery Studio 4.5 and PharmaDB. A compounds-targets-diseases network was established using Cytoscape 3.2. These suitable targets and their genes were calculated and analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis and GeneMANIA. RESULTS: Certain targets were identified in osteoporosis (8 targets), prostate cancer (9 targets), and kidney diseases (11 targets). This was the first study to identify the targets of these bioactive compounds in maca for cardiovascular diseases (29 targets). The compound with the most targets (46) was an amide alkaloid (MA-24). CONCLUSION: In silico target fishing identified maca's traditional effects on treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, prostate cancer, and kidney diseases, and its potential function of treating cardiovascular diseases, as the most important of this herb's possible activities."

      "abstract": "Although Lepidium meyenii (maca), a plant growing in Peru's central Andes, has been traditionally used for enhancing fertility and reproductive performance in domestic animals and human beings, effects of maca on reproductive organs are still unclear. This study examined whether feeding the hydroalcoholic extract powder of maca for 6 weeks affects weight of the reproductive organs, serum concentrations of testosterone and luteinising hormone (LH), number and cytoplasmic area of immunohistochemically stained Leydig cells, and steroidogenesis of cultured Leydig cells in 8-week-old male rats. Feeding the extract powder increased weight of seminal vesicles, serum testosterone level and cytoplasmic area of Leydig cells when compared with controls. Weight of prostate gland, serum LH concentration and number of Leydig cells were not affected by the maca treatment. The testosterone production by Leydig cells significantly increased when cultured with 22R-hydroxycholesterol or pregnenolone and tended to increase when cultured with hCG by feeding the extract powder. The results show that feeding the hydroalcoholic extract powder of maca for 6 weeks increases serum testosterone concentration associated with seminal vesicle stimulation in male rats, and this increase in testosterone level may be related to the enhanced ability of testosterone production by Leydig cells especially in the metabolic process following cholesterol.",

We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of maca root (3.0 g/day) in 45 female outpatients (mean age of 41.5 ± 12.5 years) with SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction whose depression remitted. Endpoints were improvement in sexual functioning as per the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) and the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Function Questionnaire (MGH-SFQ). Results. 45 of 57 consented females were randomized, and 42 (30 premenopausal and 12 postmenopausal women) were eligible for a modified intent-to-treat analysis based on having had at least one postmedication visit. Remission rates by the end of treatment were higher for the maca than the placebo group, based on attainment of an ASEX total score ≤ 10 (9.5% for maca versus 4.8% for placebo), attaining an MGH-SFQ score ≤ 12 (30.0% for maca versus 20.0% for placebo) and reaching an MGH-SFQ score ≤ 8 (9.5% for maca versus 5.0% for placebo). Higher remission rates for the maca versus placebo group were associated with postmenopausal status. Maca was well tolerated. Conclusion. Maca root may alleviate SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. This trial is registered with NCT00568126."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lepidium meyenii (Maca) has been used for centuries for its fertility-enhancing and aphrodisiac properties. In an Australian study, Maca improved anxiety and depressive scores. The effects of Maca on hormones, lipids, glucose, serum cytokines, blood pressure, menopausal symptoms and general well-being in Chinese postmenopausal women were evaluated. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was conducted in 29 postmenopausal Hong Kong Chinese women. They received 3.3 g/day of Maca or placebo for 6 weeks each, in either order, over 12 weeks. At baseline, week 6 and week 12, estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), full lipid profiles, glucose and serum cytokines were measured. The Greene Climacteric, SF-36 Version 2, Women's Health Questionnaire and Utian Quality of Life Scales were used to assess the severity of menopausal symptoms and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: There were no differences in estradiol, FSH, TSH, SHBG, glucose, lipid profiles and serum cytokines amongst those who received Maca as compared to the placebo group; however, significant decreases in diastolic blood pressure and depression were apparent after Maca treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Maca did not exert hormonal or immune biological action in the small cohort of patients studied; however, it appeared to reduce symptoms of depression and improve diastolic blood pressure in Chinese postmenopausal women. Although results are comparable to previous similar published studies in postmenopausal women, there might be a cultural difference among the Chinese postmenopausal women in terms of symptom reporting.",

Our present study aimed to evaluate the behavior and anatomical and biochemical effects of petroleum ether extract from maca (ME) in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in mice. Three different doses of maca extract (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg) were orally administrated in the six-week CUMS procedure. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was used as a positive control drug. Maca extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) significantly decreased the duration of immobility time in the tail suspension test. After treatment with maca extract (250 and 500 mg/kg), the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus appeared thicker. Maca extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) also induced a significant reduction in corticosterone levels in mouse serum. In mouse brain tissue, after six weeks of treatment, noradrenaline and dopamine levels were increased by maca extract, and the activity of reactive oxygen species was significantly inhibited. Serotonin levels were not significantly altered. These results demonstrated that maca extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) showed antidepressant-like effects and was related to the activation of both noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems, as well as attenuation of oxidative stress in mouse brain.",

The presence of H. pylori, as well as the degree and depth of the gastric mucosa inflammation was evaluated from biopsies obtained before and after the treatment based solely of Maca 3 grams per day for four weeks. RESULTS: Average values of the degree and depth of mucosal inflammation before and after the treatment were compared showing no statistical difference among the samples. Sixteen patients were infected with H. pylori, and they remained infected after the treatment with Maca. CONCLUSIONS: A four week long treatment with Maca does not produce significant changes on gastric mucosa of patients with functional dyspepsia, neither on H. pylori eradication.",

We searched 17 databases from their inception up to June 2011 and included all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared any type of maca-based intervention to a placebo for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. All studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane 'risk of bias' assessment tool. Four RCTs met all inclusion criteria. These RCTs tested the effects of maca on menopausal symptoms in healthy perimenopausal, early postmenopausal, and late postmenopausal women. Using the Kupperman Menopausal Index and the Greene Climacteric Score, all RCTs demonstrated favorable effects of maca. There have been very few rigorous trials of maca for menopausal symptoms. The results of our systematic review provide limited evidence for the effectiveness of maca as a treatment for menopausal symptoms. However, the total number of trials, the total sample size, and the average methodological quality of the primary studies, were too limited to draw firm conclusions.

The aim of this review was to assess the clinical evidence for or against the effectiveness of the maca plant as a treatment for sexual dysfunction. METHODS: We searched 17 databases from their inception to April 2010 and included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of any type of maca compared to a placebo for the treatment of healthy people or human patients with sexual dysfunction. The risk of bias for each study was assessed using Cochrane criteria, and statistical pooling of data was performed where possible. The selection of studies, data extraction, and validations were performed independently by two authors. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion by the two authors. RESULTS: Four RCTs met all the inclusion criteria. Two RCTs suggested a significant positive effect of maca on sexual dysfunction or sexual desire in healthy menopausal women or healthy adult men, respectively, while the other RCT failed to show any effects in healthy cyclists. The further RCT assessed the effects of maca in patients with erectile dysfunction using the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction-5 and showed significant effects. CONCLUSION: The results of our systematic review provide limited evidence for the effectiveness of maca in improving sexual function. However, the total number of trials, the total sample size, and the average methodological quality of the primary studies were too limited to draw firm conclusions.

At the end of the treatment, uterine weight, femoral bone and lumbar vertebra histomorphology were assessed. RESULTS: Ovariectomy reduced weight, diameter and width of the femoral bone. Estradiol, black and red maca treatment reduced the effect of ovariectomy on these variables. Histological analyses revealed that estradiol, black and red maca treatments reversed the effect of ovariectomy by increasing the trabecular bone area in the second lumbar vertebra. Uterine weight was reduced in OVX rats, and estradiol but neither black nor red maca increased uterine weight.

      "abstract": "Maca (Lepidium meyenii Walpers), is an Andean crop that grows between 3,800 and 4,500 m a.s.l. The persistent interest in this plant is based on its assumed effects on fertility of male mammals due to the prevalence of certain, partially specific, secondary compounds. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of maca supplementation on quality and quantity of semen, mating behavior, and clinical status of peripubertal breeding bulls. The experiment followed a cross-over design lasting for 23 wk with 3 wk of adaptation and baseline measurements, and 2 x 10 wk of treatment feeding thus covering two times the complete 8-wk spermatogenic cycle. Seventy-eight 55 wk to 84 wk old breeding bulls received either no maca (control) or maca (233 mg dried hypocotyls/kg body weight/day) for 10 wk followed by 10 wk without maca (maca early) or maca only in the last 10 wk (maca late). Measurements were always made in the last 2 wk of each period. Apart from standard analyses, ejaculates were analyzed by flow cytometry. Data was evaluated by analysis of variance considering the repeated measurement structure of the data. Significant treatment by measurement period indicated direct or carry-over effects of maca. Maca supplementation had no direct effect on body weight, testes circumference, rectal temperature, mating behavior, and ejaculate volume. However, supplementing maca in the first 10 wk period increased the number of sperms in the second 10 wk period, i.e., when the animals no longer received maca. The DNA fragmentation index and the visually assessed motility of the sperms of bulls, that initially showed a borderline sperm quality, were significantly improved with early maca supplementation, while no such effect was observed in the two other groups. No effects occurred in the proportion of intact sperm plasma membranes or acrosomes or both. In conclusion, maca supplementation seems to improve sperm quantity and quality of bulls to a certain degree, while mating behavior appears unaffected.",

Female mice were divided into five groups: (i) naive (control), (ii) sham, (iii) OVX mice and OVX mice treated with (iv) 0.50 g kg(-1) and (v) 2.00 g kg(-1) black maca. Mice were orally treated with distilled water or black maca during 35 days starting 7 days after surgery. Memory and learning were assessed using the water Morris maze (from day 23-27) and the step-down avoidance test (days 34 and 35). At the end of each treatment, mice were sacrificed by decapitation and brains were dissected out for MDA, Ache and MAO determinations. Black maca (0.5 and 2.0 g/kg) increased step-down latency when compared to OVX control mice. Black maca decreased MDA and Ache levels in OVX mice; whereas, no differences were observed in MAO levels. Finally, black maca improved experimental memory impairment induced by ovariectomy, due in part, by its antioxidant and Ache inhibitory activities."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the estrogenic and androgenic activity of Lepidium meyenii (Maca) and its effect on the hormonal profile and symptoms in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Fourteen postmenopausal women completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. They received 3.5 g/day of powered Maca for 6 weeks and matching placebo for 6 weeks, in either order, over a total of 12 weeks. At baseline and weeks 6 and 12 blood samples were collected for the measurement of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone-binding globulin, and the women completed the Greene Climacteric Scale to assess the severity of menopausal symptoms. In addition, aqueous and methanolic Maca extracts were tested for androgenic and estrogenic activity using a yeast-based hormone-dependent reporter assay. RESULTS: No differences were seen in serum concentrations of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone-binding globulin between baseline, Maca treatment, and placebo (P > 0.05). The Greene Climacteric Scale revealed a significant reduction in scores in the areas of psychological symptoms, including the subscales for anxiety and depression and sexual dysfunction after Maca consumption compared with both baseline and placebo (P < 0.05). These findings did not correlate with androgenic or alpha-estrogenic activity present in the Maca as no physiologically significant activity was observed in yeast-based assays employing up to 4 mg/mL Maca extract (equivalent to 200 mg/mL Maca). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings show that Lepidium meyenii (Maca) (3.5 g/d) reduces psychological symptoms, including anxiety and depression, and lowers measures of sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women independent of estrogenic and androgenic activity.",

Lepidium meyenii (Maca) is a Peruvian plant that grows exclusively over 4000 m above sea level. The present study was designed to determine the effect of red maca (RM) in the prostate hyperplasia induced with testosterone enanthate (TE) in adult mice. Prostate hyperplasia was induced by administering TE, and then these animals (n = 6, each group) were treated with RM or Finasteride (positive control) for 21 days. There was an additional group without prostate hyperplasia (vehicle). Mice were killed on days 7, 14 and 21 after treatment with RM. Testosterone and oestradiol levels were measured on the last day of treatment. Prostatic stroma, epithelium and acini were measured histologically. RM reduced prostate weight at 21 days of treatment. Weights of seminal vesicles, testis and epididymis were not affected by RM treatment. The reduction in prostate size by RM was 1.59 times. Histological analysis showed that TE increased 2-fold the acinar area, effect prevented in the groups receiving TE + RM for 14 (P < 0.05) and 21 (P < 0.05) days and the group receiving TE + Finasteride for 21 days (P < 0.05). TE increased prostatic stroma area and this effect was prevented by treatment with RM since 7 days of treatment or Finasteride. The reduction in prostatic stroma area by RM was 1.42 times. RM has an anti-hyperplastic effect on the prostate of adult mice when hyperplasia was induced with TE acting first at prostatic stromal level.",

In addition, testis DNA quantification was also determined. Any toxic effect was assessed in liver and spleen by histological studies. The results indicate that Yellow Maca and Black Maca improved ESC and that three varieties of maca increased the SCVD without affecting DSP. Moreover, testis DNA levels were not affected by treatment with any of the three varieties of maca. Histological picture of the liver in animals treated with the three varieties of maca was similar to that observed in controls. In conclusion, Yellow and Black Maca increased epididymal sperm count after 84 days of treatment without affecting DSP.

SETTING: Animal and laboratory facilities at a university. ANIMAL(S): Forty two adult male rats from the Holtzman strain (3 months old). INTERVENTION(S): Hydroalcoholic extract of Black Maca was partitioned with the following solvents: petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water to obtain each fraction. Forty-two rats were divided in different groups according the fraction administered and vehicle. The hydroalcoholic extract of Black Maca and its fractions and vehicle were given orally by gavage for 7 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Daily sperm production, epididymal sperm count, and sperm count in the vas deferens. RESULT(S): Daily sperm production was higher in the ethyl acetate group compared with all other groups. The epididymal sperm count was higher in rats treated with ethyl acetate fraction compared with rats treated with vehicle (control), petroleum ether, n-butanol, or water fractions. The sperm count in vas deferens was lower in rats treated with ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, or water fractions compared with the control group; thus, the sperm count in vas deferens in rats treated with chloroform and n-butanol fractions was higher than in the petroleum ether group. CONCLUSION(S): The greatest effect on spermatogenesis was observed in the ethyl acetate fraction from the hydroalcoholic extract of Black Maca, suggesting that the compounds related to the beneficial effect on sperm production of Black Maca are presented in this fraction. Antioxidant components could play a role in the effect of increased epididymal sperm concentration observed in the model.",

For generations people of the rural community in Peru have used Lepidium meyenii Walpers (Maca), because of their belief that it improves fertility and sexual desire. AIM: To determine the acute and chronic effects of Maca on male sexual behavior and to examine chronic administration of Maca on anxiety. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ejaculatory and mounting behavior and postejaculatory interval. Anxiety tests using an elevated plus maze, locomotion, and social interaction with another male. METHODS: Maca (25 and 100 mg/kg) was orally administered to male rats for 30 days. Male sexual behavior was monitored after acute, 7 and 21 days of treatment. Anxiety behavior and locomotion were measured at 28-29 days using the elevated plus maze and social interaction tests. RESULTS: Maca treatment did not produce large changes in male sexual behavior. However, an increase in ejaculation latency and postejaculatory interval was observed after both acute and 7 days of treatment. After 21 days of treatment Maca had no effect on sexual behavior. Chronic administration of Maca did not increase locomotion or anxiety. CONCLUSION: Acute and short-term administration of Maca produced a small effect of rat male sexual behavior and long-term administration did not increase anxiety.",

Rats were treated with freeze-dried aqueous extract of Red Maca at doses of 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 g/kg body wt. A positive control group received Finasteride (0.6 mg/kg body wt.). After treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the ventral prostate was extracted, and weighed. HPLC was used to determine the presence of glucosinolates in Red Maca. The prostate weight diminished in a dose-dependent fashion in rats treated with Red Maca. The effect of Red Maca was better than that observed with Finasteride. Finasteride, but not Red Maca, reduced seminal vesicles weight. Analysis of the HPLC indicated the presence of benzyl glucosinolate (Glucotropaeolin) with a content of 0.639%. Serum testosterone levels were not affected by Red Maca. Moreover, serum testosterone levels were not related to prostate or seminal vesicles weight in rats treated with vehicle and Red Maca. In conclusion, Red Maca administered orally in rats seems to exert an inhibitory effect at a level post DHT conversion, on the BPH-induced experimentally, although a direct measure of reductase action would still be required.",

Total of 34 Caucasian women volunteers participated in a double-blind, randomized, four months outpatient crossover configuration Trial. After fulfilling the criteria of being early-postmenopausal: blood Estrogen (E2<40 pg/ml) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH>30 IU/ml) at admission, they were randomly allocated to Placebo (P) and Maca-GO (M) treatments (2 groups of 11 participants each). Two 500 mg vegetable hard gel capsules with Maca-GO or Placebo powder were self-administered twice daily with meals (total 2 g/day). At admission and follow-up monthly intervals, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, levels of gonadal, pituitary, thyroid and adrenal hormones, lipids and key minerals were measured. Bone markers were determined after four months M and P use in 12 participants. Menopausal symptoms were assessed according to Greene's Score (GMS) and Kupperman's Index (KMI). Data were analyzed using multivariate technique on blocs of monthly. Results and canonical variate technique was applied to GMS and KMI matrices. Two months application of Maca-GO stimulated (P<0.05) production of E2, suppressed (P<0.05) blood FSH, Thyroid (T3) and Adrenocorticotropic hormones, Cortisol, and BMI, increased (P<0.05) low density lipoproteins, blood Iron and alleviated (P<0.001) menopausal symptoms. Maca-GO noticeably increased bone density markers. In conclusion, Maca-GO applied to early-postmenopausal women (i) acted as a toner of hormonal processes along the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Ovarian axis, (ii) balanced hormone levels and (iii) relieved symptoms of menopausal discomfort, (hot flushes and night sweating in particular), thus, (iv) exhibited a distinctive function peculiar to adaptogens, providing an alternative non-hormonal plant option to reduce dependence on hormone therapy programs (HRT)."

At the baseline and follow- up monthly intervals, blood levels of FSH, E2, progesterone (PRG) and lutinizing hormone (LH), as well as serum cholesterol (CHOL), triglycerides (TRG), high- and low density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL) were measured. Menopausal symptoms were assessed according to Greene's Score (GMS) and Kupperman's Index (KMI).

Maca-GO significantly stimulated production of E2 (P<0.001) with a simultaneous suppression (P<0.05) of blood FSH, increase (P<0.05) in HDL. Maca-GO significantly reduced both frequency and severity of individual menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweating in particular) resulting in significant (P<0.001) alleviation of KMI (from 22 to 10), thus, offering an attractive non-hormonal addition to the choices available to early-postmenopausal women in the form of a natural plant alternative to Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) - hence, reducing dependence on hormone therapy programs."

The hypocotyls of this plant are traditionally used in the Andean region for their supposed fertility-enhancing properties. The hypocotyls have different colours. Of these, Black maca has better effects on spermatogenesis. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that Black maca has early effects during a spermatogenic cycle (12 days) of male rats. For this, testicular spermatid, epididymal sperm and vas deferens sperm counts were measured after 1, 3, 5, 7 and 12 days of treatment with Black maca. Aqueous extract of Black maca was given orally by daily gavage at a dose of 2 g kg(-1). In a spermatogenic cycle, compared with day 1, daily sperm production (DSP) was lower at day 7 (control), whereas with Black maca, the difference was observed at day 12. Epididymal sperm count was higher in rats treated with Black maca at days 1, 3 and 7, but similar to controls at days 5 and 12; similarly sperm counts in vas deferens was higher in rats treated with Black maca in days 3, 5 and 7, but similar to controls at days 1 and 12. From this, it is suggested that first action of Black maca was at epididymal level increasing sperm count after 1 day of treatment, whereas an increase in sperm count was observed in vas deferens at day 3 of treatment. Finally, an increase in DSP was observed after 7 days of treatment with Black maca. Testicular testosterone was not affected after 7 days treatment with Black maca. In conclusion, Black maca affects sperm count as early as 1 day after beginning of treatment.",

(Brassicaceae), known as Maca, is a Peruvian hypocotyl growing exclusively between 4000 and 4500 m altitude in the central Peruvian Andes, particularly in Junin plateau and is used traditionally to enhance fertility. Maca is a cultivated plant and different cultivars are described according to the color of the hypocotyls. METHODS: The study aimed to elucidate the effect of Yellow, Red and Black Maca on cognitive function and depression in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In all experiments OVX mice were treated during 21 days and divided in four groups: control group, Yellow Maca, Red Maca and Black Maca. Latent learning was assessed using the water finding task and the antidepressant activity of the three varieties of Maca was evaluated using the forced swimming test. Animals were sacrificed at the end of each treatment and the uterus were excised and weighed. RESULTS: Black Maca was the variety that showed the best response in the water finding task, particularly in the trained mice. The three varieties were effective to reduce finding latency in non trained and trained mice (P < 0.05). In the force swimming test, all varieties assessed reduced the time of immobility and increased uterine weight in OVX mice. CONCLUSION: Black Maca appeared to have more beneficial effects on latent learning in OVX mice; meanwhile, all varieties of Maca showed antidepressant activity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Roots of cruciferous plant Lepidium peruvianum Chacon cultivated in high plateaus of Andes and known under its common name Maca, have been traditionally-used as an energizing vegetable with therapeutic properties for both men and women. Maca has been recognized by natives of Peru as herbal remedy helping to treat conditions affecting menopausal women. OBJECTIVE: The effects of Pre-Gelatinized Organic Maca (Maca-GO) on quantitative physiological responses and alleviation of symptoms contributing to menopausal discomfort in perimenopausal women was examined. METHODS: IN THIS, FOUR MONTHS, DOUBLE BLIND, CROSSOVER, RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL, MONTHLY MEASUREMENTS OF THE FOLLOWING BLOOD SERUM CONSTITUENTS WERE TAKEN: Estrogen (E2), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Progesterone (PGS), Cortisol (CT), Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), Thyroid Hormones (TSH, T3, T4), minerals (Ca, K, Fe) and lipid profile (Triglicerides, Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL). In monthly interviews conducted by gynecologist, body weight and blood pressure were registered and Menopausal Index according to Kupperman's was determined. Toxicity of Maca -GO determined on rats showed its safe use at the level of 7.5mg/kg body weight. A group of 20 women (aged 41-50 years), who fulfilled criteria of being in perimenopausal stage (E2 above 40pg/ml and FSH below 30IU/ml), were randomly allocated to two even groups, one receiving for two months Maca-GO and the other Placebo capsules followed by a crossover with treatment change for another two months period. All participants signed informed consent to participate. Two 500mg hard capsules with Maca-GO or Placebo were self-administered by participants twice daily with meals (total 2g/day). RESULTS: Two months administration of Maca-GO significantly alleviated symptoms of discomfort observed in majority of women involved in the study (74%-87%) as assessed by Kupperman's Menopausal index. This was associated with significant increase in E2 and FSH, Progesterone and ACTH levels, and reduction in blood pressure, body weight, Triglycerides and Cholesterol levels. There was a distinctive placebo effect observed at the beginning of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that in addition to reduction in body weight, blood pressure and increasing serum HDL and Iron, pre-gelatinized Maca-GO may be a valuable non-hormonal plant preparation for balancing levels of hormones (FSH, E2, PG and ACTH) and alleviating negative physiological and psychological symptoms (frequency of hot flushes, incidence in night sweating, interrupted sleep pattern, nervousness, depression and heart palpitations) experienced by women in perimenopausal stage. It appears that Maca-GO may act as a toner of hormonal processes, leading to alleviation of discomfort felt by perimenopausal women, hence, its potential use as non-hormonal alternative to HRT program."

The lengths of stages of the seminiferous epithelium were assessed by transillumination. Also, sex organ weights, testicular and epididymal sperm count, sperm motility, daily sperm production, sperm transit rate and serum testosterone levels were measured. Lead acetate treatment resulted in a dose-response reduction of lengths of stages VIII and IX-XI, and serum testosterone levels. However, rats treated with 8 and 16 mg/kg but not 24 mg/kg of lead acetate showed a low number of testicular spermatids, low daily sperm production (DSP) and low epididymal sperm count. Administration of Maca to rats treated with lead acetate resulted in higher lengths of stages VIII and IX-XI with respect to lead acetate-treated rats. Moreover, treatment with Maca to lead acetate-treated rats resulted in lengths of stages VIII and IX-XI similar to the control group. Maca administration also reduced the deleterious effect on DSP caused by lead acetate treatment. Maca prevented LA-induced spermatogenic disruption in rats and it may become in a potential treatment of male infertility associated with lead exposure.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-corrected clinical pilot study was aimed at assessing the use of hypocotyls of cruciferous Andean plant Maca (Lepidium peruvianum Chacon), in alleviating symptoms of menopausal discomfort experienced by women in early post menopause as measured by profiles of serum hormones: Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH), Estrogen (E2) and Progesterone (PG) and as assessed by Greene's Menopausal Index. DESIGN: Study was conducted on 20 Caucasian healthy early-postmenopausal women volunteers during the three months period (Trial I) and on eight women during nine months period (Trial II). Hormone levels were determined in blood with a simultaneous assessment of menopausal index at the start of study, after one month use of placebo, and after two and eight months administration of 2g gelatinized Maca root powder (Maca-GO) in the form of two 500mg hard gel capsules, twice daily. RESULTS: In comparison to placebo, after both, two and eight months administration of Maca-GO capsules to EPMW, level of FSH significantly (P<0.05) decreased with a simultaneous significant (P<0.05) increase in the LH level, resulting in significant (P<0.05) increase in both E2 and PG, after eight months of Maca-GO treatment only. There was a significant (P<0.05) placebo effect resulting in an elevated PG level after one month administration of placebo capsules. Changes in hormone levels was accompanied by substantially-reduced feeling of discomfort associated with menopause, although, there was a distinctive, positive placebo effect as judged by responses to Greene's questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: It is reasonable to suggest that Maca-GO when used in EPMW, depending on the length of use, was acting as a toner of hormonal processes as reflected by decrease in FSH and increased LH secretion, which stimulated production of both ovarian hormones, E2 and PG and resulted in a substantial reduction of menopausal discomfort felt by women participating in the study, with a distinctive placebo effect, thus, fully justifying further, more complex study on effectiveness of Maca-GO as a reliable alternative to HRT program."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lepidium meyenii, known as Maca, grows exclusively in the Peruvian Andes over 4000 m altitude. It has been used traditionally to increase fertility. Previous scientific studies have demonstrated that Maca increases spermatogenesis and epididymal sperm count. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of Maca on several fertility parameters of female mice at reproductive age. METHODS: Adult female Balb/C mice were divided at random into three main groups: i) Reproductive indexes group, ii) Implantation sites group and iii) Assessment of uterine weight in ovariectomized mice. Animals received an aqueous extract of lyophilized Yellow Maca (1 g/Kg BW) or vehicle orally as treatment. In the fertility indexes study, animals received the treatment before, during and after gestation. The fertility index, gestation index, post-natal viability index, weaning viability index and sex ratio were calculated. Sexual maturation was evaluated in the female pups by the vaginal opening (VO) day. In the implantation study, females were checked for implantation sites at gestation day 7 and the embryos were counted. In ovariectomized mice, the uterine weight was recorded at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Implantation sites were similar in mice treated with Maca and in controls. All reproductive indexes were similar in both groups of treatment. The number of pups per dam at birth and at postnatal day 4 was significantly higher in the group treated with Maca. VO day occurred earlier as litter size was smaller. Maca did not affect VO day. In ovariectomized mice, the treatment with Maca increased significantly the uterine weights in comparison to their respective control group. CONCLUSION: Administration of aqueous extract of Yellow Maca to adult female mice increases the litter size. Moreover, this treatment increases the uterine weight in ovariectomized animals. Our study confirms for the first time some of the traditional uses of Maca to enhance female fertility.",

METHODS: Mice were treated with 80 mg/kg of malathion in the presence or absence of an aqueous extract of Maca, which was orally administered 7, 14 or 21 days after injection of the malathion. Stages of the seminiferous epithelium were assessed by transillumination on days 0, 7, 14 and 21. RESULTS: The administration of Maca increased significantly the length of stage VIII on days 7, 14 and 21 of treatment compared with the controls. An increase in the length of stage IX occurred on day 14 of treatment. Malathion affected spermatogenesis by reducing the lengths of stage IX on day 7, stages VII and IX-XI on day 14 and a recovery of stages IX-XII on day 21. The magnitude of alteration in the length of stage IX produced by malathion was significantly reduced by Maca on days 7 and 14. The length of stage VIII was increased when Maca was administered to mice treated with malathion. Assessment of the relative length of stages of the seminiferous epithelium showed that Maca treatment resulted in rapid recovery of the effect of malathion.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have found that consumption of cruciferous vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. This effect seems to be due to aromatic glucosinolate content. Glucosinolates are known for have both antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions. Maca is a cruciferous cultivated in the highlands of Peru. The absolute content of glucosinolates in Maca hypocotyls is relatively higher than that reported in other cruciferous crops. Therefore, Maca may have proapoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in the prostate. METHODS: Male rats treated with or without aqueous extracts of three ecotypes of Maca (Yellow, Black and Red) were analyzed to determine the effect on ventral prostate weight, epithelial height and duct luminal area. Effects on serum testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) levels were also assessed. Besides, the effect of Red Maca on prostate was analyzed in rats treated with testosterone enanthate (TE). RESULTS: Red Maca but neither Yellow nor Black Maca reduced significantly ventral prostate size in rats. Serum T or E2 levels were not affected by any of the ecotypes of Maca assessed. Red Maca also prevented the prostate weight increase induced by TE treatment. Red Maca administered for 42 days reduced ventral prostatic epithelial height. TE increased ventral prostatic epithelial height and duct luminal area. These increases by TE were reduced after treatment with Red Maca for 42 days. Histology pictures in rats treated with Red Maca plus TE were similar to controls. Phytochemical screening showed that aqueous extract of Red Maca has alkaloids, steroids, tannins, saponins, and cardiotonic glycosides. The IR spectra of the three ecotypes of Maca in 3800-650 cm (-1) region had 7 peaks representing 7 functional chemical groups. Highest peak values were observed for Red Maca, intermediate values for Yellow Maca and low values for Black Maca. These functional groups correspond among others to benzyl glucosinolate. CONCLUSIONS: Red Maca, a cruciferous plant from the highland of Peru, reduced ventral prostate size in normal and TE treated rats.",

      "abstract": "The reasons why human mammary tumors become resistant to tamoxifen therapy are mainly unknown. Changes in gene expression may occur as cells acquire resistance to antiestrogens. We therefore undertook a comparative gene expression analysis of tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant human breast cancer in vivo models using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays to analyze differential gene expression. Total RNAs from the tamoxifen-sensitive patient-derived mammary carcinoma xenograft MaCa 3366 and the tamoxifen-resistant model MaCa 3366/TAM were hybridized to Affymetrix HuGeneFL and to Hu95Av2 arrays. Pairwise comparisons and clustering algorithms were applied to identify differentially expressed genes and patterns of gene expression. As revealed by cluster analysis, the tamoxifen-sensitive and the tamoxifen-resistant breast carcinomas differed regarding their gene expression pattern. More than 100 transcripts are changed in abundance in MaCa 3366/TAM as compared with MaCa 3366. Among the genes that are differentially expressed in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors, there are several IFN-inducible and estrogen-responsive genes, and genes known to be involved in breast carcinogenesis. The genes neuronatin (NNAT) and bone marrow stem cell antigen 2 (BST2) were sharply up-regulated in MaCa 3366/TAM. The differential expression of four genes (NNAT, BST2, IGFBP5, and BCAS1) was confirmed by Taqman PCR. Our results provide the starting point for deriving markers for tamoxifen resistance by differential gene expression profiling in a human breast cancer model of acquired tamoxifen resistance. Finally, genes whose expression profiles are distinctly changed between the two xenograft lines will be further evaluated as potential targets for diagnostic or therapeutic approaches of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.",

Maca is traditionally employed in the Andean region for its supposed fertility-enhancing properties. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Maca can prevent high altitude-induced testicular disturbances. Adult male rats were exposed for 21 days to an altitude of 4340 m and treated with vehicle or aqueous extract of Maca (666.6 mg/day). The lengths of the stages of the seminiferous epithelium and epididymal sperm counts were obtained at 0, 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure. The stages of the seminiferous tubules were assessed by transillumination. A dose-response study was also performed at sea level to determine the effect of Maca given to male rats at doses of 0, 6.6, 66.6 and 666.6 mg/day for 7 days on body weight, seminiferous tubule stages and epididymal sperm count. The length of stage VIII and the epididymal sperm count were increased in a dose-dependent manner in Maca-treated rats but treatment reduced the length of stage I. At the highest dose, sperm count increased 1.58 times, the length of stage VIII increased 2.4 times and the length of stage I was reduced 0.48 times compared with the value at dose 0. Exposure to high altitude resulted in a reduction in epididymal sperm count after 7 days and lower values were maintained up to 21 days. Altitude reduced spermiation (stage VIII) to half and the onset of spermatogenesis (stages IX-XI) to a quarter on days 7 and 14 but treatment with Maca (666.6 mg/day) prevented these changes. Data on transillumination and epididymal sperm count in the Maca-treated group exposed to high altitude were similar to those obtained at sea level. Maca increased the sperm count on day 21 of exposure to high altitude to values similar (1095.25 +/- 20.41x10(6) sperm, means +/- S.E.M.) to those obtained in the Maca-treated group at sea level (1132.30 +/- 172.95x10(6) sperm). Furthermore, in the Maca-treated group exposed for 21 days to high altitude, epididymal sperm count was higher than in the non-treated group at sea level (690.49 +/- 43.67x10(6) sperm). In conclusion, treatment of rats with Maca at high altitude prevented high altitude-induced spermatogenic disruption.",

METHODS: In Holtzman rats, Maca alcoholic extract (5 %) was given by oral route at doses of 48 mg/day or 96 mg/day for 7 days, 14 days and 21 days. Testicular function was assessed by measurements of lengths of different stages of seminiferous epithelia and by epididymal sperm count. RESULTS: Ethanolic extract of Maca increased the length of stages IX-XI of seminiferous epithelium at treatment day 7, day 14 and day 21. Progression of spermatogenesis was evident only after day 21 when lengths of stages XII-XIV of seminiferous epithelium were increased; at day 7 and day 14, no important change in spermatogenesis was observed. Epididymal sperm count was increased with 48 mg/day at all times. With 96 mg/day an increase in sperm count was observed at day 7, but it was reduced at day 14 and day 21 of treatment. Serum testosterone levels were not affected. CONCLUSION: The alcoholic extract of Maca activates onset ant progression of spermatogenesis at 48 mg/day or 96 mg/day in rats.",

      "abstract": "Lepidium meyenii (Maca) is a Peruvian hypocotyl that grows exclusively between 4000 and 4500 m in the central Andes. Maca is traditionally employed in the Andean region for its supposed aphrodisiac and/or fertility-enhancing properties. This study was a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel trial in which active treatment with different doses of Maca Gelatinizada was compared with a placebo. The study aimed to test the hypothesis that Maca has no effect on serum reproductive hormone levels in apparently healthy men when administered in doses used for aphrodisiac and/or fertility-enhancing properties. Men aged between 21 and 56 Years received 1500 mg or 3000 mg Maca. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone and 17-beta estradiol were measured before and at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment with placebo or Maca (1.5 g or 3.0 g per day). Data showed that compared with placebo Maca had no effect on any of the hormones studied nor did the hormones show any changes over time. Multiple regression analysis showed that serum testosterone levels were not affected by treatment with Maca at any of the times studied (P, not significant). In conclusion, treatment with Maca does not affect serum reproductive hormone levels.",

Men aged 21-56 years received Maca in one of two doses: 1,500 mg or 3,000 mg or placebo. Self-perception on sexual desire, score for Hamilton test for depression, and Hamilton test for anxiety were measured at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. An improvement in sexual desire was observed with Maca since 8 weeks of treatment. Serum testosterone and oestradiol levels were not different in men treated with Maca and in those treated with placebo (P:NS). Logistic regression analysis showed that Maca has an independent effect on sexual desire at 8 and 12 weeks of treatment, and this effect is not because of changes in either Hamilton scores for depression or anxiety or serum testosterone and oestradiol levels. In conclusion, treatment with Maca improved sexual desire.",

METHODS: Nine men received tablets of Maca (1500 or 3000 mg/day) for 4 months. Seminal analysis was performed according to guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). Serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin (PRL), testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: Treatment with Maca resulted in increased seminal volume, sperm count per ejaculum, motile sperm count, and sperm motility. Serum hormone levels were not modified with Maca treatment. Increase of sperm count was not related to dose of Maca. CONCLUSION: Maca improved sperm production and sperm motility by mechanisms not related to LH, FSH, PRL, T and E2.",

METHODS: Male rats received an aqueous extract of the root (66.7 mg in one mL) twice a day for 14 consecutive days. RESULTS: Treatment with Lepidium meyenii resulted in an increase in the weights of testis and epididymis but not the seminal vesicle weight. The length and frequency of stages IX-XIV seminiferous tubules, where mitosis occurred, were increased and stages I-VI were reduced in rats treated with Lepidium meyenii. CONCLUSION: The Lepidium meyenii root invigorates spermatogenesis in male rats by acting on its initial stages (IX-XIV).",
