      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of irrigation water sources on the quality of olive oil from the Chemlal olive variety in the Hadjadj region, northeast of Mostaganem, Algeria, a coastal area known for its semi-arid climate and intensive olive cultivation. Olive trees (n = 50 per irrigation group) were irrigated with treated wastewater, spring water, and normal water, and the resulting oils were assessed for physicochemical properties, fatty acid composition, and bioactive compound profiles. Treated wastewater demonstrated distinct water quality characteristics, including elevated temperature (15.00 °C), chemical oxygen demand (COD: 58.38 mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5: 29.00 mg/L), ammonium (15.60 mg/L), nitrite (2.55 mg/L), suspended solids (14.00 mg/L), pH (7.40), and conductivity (2.80 µS/cm), reflecting residual organic material and ionic content post-treatment. Heavy metal concentrations in all water sources were within permissible limits for irrigation and drinking purposes, affirming their safety for agricultural use. Olive oil from treated wastewater-irrigated trees exhibited superior quality parameters, including low acidity (1.99%), low peroxide value (6.8 meq O2/kg), enhanced oxidative stability, higher fat content (96.5%), and favorable saponification values. Fatty acid analysis revealed a higher oleic acid content (62.6 mg/kg), known for cardiovascular health benefits. Bioactive compound analysis indicated significantly elevated levels of α-tocopherol (180.25 mg/kg), squalene (7500.8 mg/kg), carotenoids (25.1 mg/kg), and polyphenols (604.76 mg GAE/kg), contributing to increased antioxidant capacity (63.50% DPPH inhibition, a measure of free radical scavenging) and lower lipid peroxidation (0.25 TBARS, an index of oxidative degradation), indicative of superior oxidative stability. Spring water-irrigated oils showed higher acidity, peroxide values, and linoleic acid concentrations, alongside notable antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia. coli, Pseudomonas. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus. aureus. Oils from normal water irrigation were characterized by higher linolenic acid levels, providing a more balanced fatty acid profile. These findings underscore treated wastewater's potential to enhance olive oil's nutritional and functional qualities, particularly its antioxidant activity and stability, while highlighting the role of spring water in enhancing antibacterial properties despite slightly reduced antioxidant stability. These findings are relevant to water-scarce Mediterranean and arid regions, informing sustainable irrigation strategies in line with global climate-resilient agriculture policies.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effects of the combination of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) supplementation and a health-related lifestyle intervention on disease activity and cardiovascular disease risk factors in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A total of 38 women with SLE were randomly assigned to EVOO (n = 9) and EVOO combined with multicomponent health promotion and physical exercise program (EVOO + HRLI) (n = 15) or control (CG) (n = 14) groups for 24 weeks. Baseline and post-intervention assessments were performed, collecting data on disease activity, accrual damage, blood biochemical parameters, arterial stiffness parameters, Framingham risk score, anthropometric and body composition measurements, and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: No changes in disease activity were observed in any group after the intervention. For cardiovascular risk, significant differences were observed in the intervention groups for systolic and mean blood pressure, with greater reductions in the EVOO + HRLI (p = 0.036 vs. p < 0.001; p = 0.017 vs. p < 0.001, respectively). The EVOO group showed significant reductions in BFM and BFP (p = 0.042, p = 0.022, respectively). The EVOO+ HRLI group also showed significant reductions in triglycerides (p < 0.001), Aix brachial (p = 0.037), central systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), central pulse pressure (p = 0.05), body mass index (p = 0.006), body fat mass and skeletal muscle mass (p = 0.039) after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a multidisciplinary program integrating nutritional interventions, health education, and the promotion of regular physical activity in SLE patients has the potential to significantly improve cardiovascular risk factors and body composition parameters. Thus, integrating this approach into clinical practice alongside usual pharmacological treatments would be beneficial for SLE patients. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05261529.",

      "abstract": "Background: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss in clumps about the size and shape of a quarter. The estimated prevalence of the disorder is approximately 1 in 1000 people, with a lifetime risk of approximately 2 percent. One of the systemic therapies for alopecia areata consists of the use of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants. Methods: Baricitinib (BCT) is a Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2 selective inhibitor used as an immunosuppressant drug. In this study, three olive oil BCT formulations (Oil A, Oil B, and Oil C, which differ in their content in squalene, tocopherol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosol) have been developed for topical delivery. The formulations were physicochemically characterized and the in vitro drug release and ex vivo permeation through human skin tissues were assessed. Results: The results showed nearly identical viscosity across all three formulations, exhibiting Newtonian behavior. The mathematical modeling used to describe the drug release profiles was the one-site binding hyperbola for all formulations. Oil-based formulations showed a slow BCT penetration into human skin. Skin integrity remained intact during the experiments, with no signs of irritation or alterations observed. In addition, all the formulations proved their efficacy in vivo. Conclusions: Among the formulations, Oil A demonstrated the highest ability retention capacity (Qr = 1875 ± 124.32 ng/cm2) in the skin, making it an excellent candidate for further investigation in the treatment of alopecia areata."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of acidification on olive paste to enhance the extraction of olive oil enriched in bioactive phenolic compounds, aiming to develop a novel functional food. Recognizing that acidic pH promotes the activity of β-glucosidase responsible for oleuropein and ligstroside hydrolysis, food-grade organic acids-citric, ascorbic, and acetic acid-were added prior to malaxation to improve the bioactive compound content in the resulting oils. A randomized experimental design was employed, using three different doses of each acid (1, 2, and 4%) with three replicates per dose, alongside control trials without acid addition. Acidification did not affect olive oil extraction efficiency or alter quality parameters for extra virgin olive oils. Treatment with 1% ascorbic acid significantly increased phenolic compound content by 37% compared to controls. Secoiridoids comprised 79.4% of the total phenolic content, with oleacein as the predominant compound (237.58 ± 9.18 mg/kg), representing over 50% of the total. This increased oleacein concentration led to up to a 67% enhancement in antioxidant capacity (428.63 ± 31.57 mg Trolox/kg) compared to controls. The antioxidant capacities of 3,4-DHPEA, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, and 3,4-DHPEA-EA were determined to be 12.05, 5.80, and 4.91 µmol TE/mg, respectively. Furthermore, the 1% ascorbic acid treatment enhanced volatile compounds associated with the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway while reducing ethanol levels."

      "abstract": "The human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) is a high-risk human papillomavirus strain commonly associated with oropharyngeal cancers, including lymph node involvement. The treatment for HPV 16-related tonsil cancer, commonly involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, presents significant challenges. Complications such as oral mucositis, xerostomia, dysphagia, dysgeusia, hypogeusia, impaired gustatory function, and significant weight loss frequently arise, leading to reduced nutritional intake, impaired healing, and recovery progression. These challenges underscore the need for supportive interventions to enhance rehabilitation and the post-recovery period, improve treatment tolerance, and maintain quality of life. Objective: This single-subject study examines a 67-year-old male patient diagnosed with a T1N3b (small primary tumor with advanced lump node involvement) associated with HPV 16 positivity, indicating a virus-associated oncogenesis. Methods: The patient underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy, leading to treatment-associated side effects. After having dietary drinks for daily nourishment, the patient routinely incorporated oral bio extra virgin olive oil (BEVOO) to cope with indicated challenges. Results: Body composition and metabolic parameters showed treatment-induced declines, followed by substantial but not complete recovery during follow-up examination. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores reflected gradual improvements in dysphagia, xerostomia, mucositis, and subtle but ongoing enhancement of the dysgeusia, gustatory perception, and oral palatability. The BEVOO supplementation and mindfulness were associated with positive recovery trends. Additional variables could have impacted the outcomes, preceding and throughout treatment, including the patient's cognitive and somatic health, environmental conditions, dietary habits, individual attitudes toward recovery, physical activity, and patient way of life. Conclusions: These results emphasize the need for additional research employing a comprehensive, multi-factorial framework that accounts for the complex interplay of physiological, psycho-social, and environmental contributors. More extensive, more diverse studies are essential to confirm these observations and substantiate the role of BEVOO as a supportive intervention in cancer recovery."

      "abstract": "This study evaluated a potassium carbonate-olive oil solution's efficacy in removing a wax from gelatin films (model surfaces). The solution (pH 12.15-12.40) was most effective with 1 % olive oil. Dipping treatment increased wax-free film thickness by 89 % and wax-containing films by 36 %, while reducing density by 50 % and 21 %, respectively. Optical analysis confirmed wax removal, showing a 20 % drop in whiteness and 144 % higher opacity in wax-containing films. Thermal analysis revealed a 35 % lower wax melting enthalpy and 28 % less mass loss in treated films. FTIR spectra showed reduced ester CO peak intensity (1735 cm-1), confirming hydrolysis. Post-treatment, the solution's particle size grew to 2138 nm, zeta potential fell to 20.4 mV, and surface tension dropped to 40.94 mN/m. Microscopy revealed increased particle aggregation with wax-containing films. These results demonstrate the potassium carbonate-olive oil solution's effectiveness in wax removal from gelatin film surfaces through hydrolysis, emulsification, and solubilization mechanisms."

Our aim is to explore the effect of enterally administered extra virgin olive oil (EO) with rich polyphenol content on clinical parameters, histopathological score, Transforming growt factor beta-1 (TGFβ1), Caspase 3 and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in NE-related lung injury of neonatal rats. METHODS: Three groups (control, NE, NE+EO) were created, with 8 neonatal rats in each group. NE was induced by hypoxia-hyperoxia-hypothermia and formula feeding. EO was given to the treatment group by orogastric probe for 3 days. Intestinal and lung tissue were excised for analysis. RESULTS: TGFβ1 expression levels, TGFβ1 and MDA concentration levels were higher in the NE compared to NE +  EO and control groups (p < 0.001), and their levels decreased after EO treatment compared to the NE group (p < 0.001). It was determined that EO treatment significantly reduced the histopathological damage and the caspase-3 (CASP3) expression level in the lung (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize that TGFß1 has an crucial function in NE-related lung injury and that EO has therapeutic potential in NE-related lung injury.",

      "abstract": "The current research aims to monitor the physicochemical changes in various varieties of extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) supplemented with exogenous polyphenolic extract from olive fruit, enriched with hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) and its derivatives, compared to numerous refined olive oils, sunflower oil, and high oleic sunflower oil under different deep-frying conditions (170-210 °C for 3 to 6 h, with/without added HTyr. Acidity, K232, K270, ∆K, peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AnV), TOTOX, refractive index (RI), carotenoids, chlorophyll, and antioxidant capacity using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) approach were evaluated. The results show that EVOO varieties generally exhibit lower acidity and thermal degradation compared to refined olive oils, particularly when deep-fried at 170 °C for 3 h with exogenous HTyr (the best treatment). Royuela, Koroneiki, Empeltre, Manzanilla, and Arbosana EVOO varieties demonstrated lower K232 values (1.36, 1.67, 1.79, 1.82, and 1.81, respectively). Under optimal deep-frying conditions, all EVOO varieties fell within the standard K232 limit for EVOO (≤2.5), except for Cornicabra. Regarding K270, only Royuela (0.11) and Manzanilla (0.22) were below the standard limit of ≤0.22. These two varieties also exhibited the lowest ΔK values (0.00). The findings further revealed that Royuela, Koroneiki, and Manzanilla had the lowest TOTOX values, with 20.76, 23.38, and 23.85, respectively. Moreover, Koroneiki and Arbosana had the highest carotenoid ratios, with values of 17.5 mg/kg and 13.7 mg/kg, respectively. Koroneiki, Arbosana, and olive oil 1° also displayed the highest chlorophyll concentrations, with values of 50.2, 53.7, and 47.5 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the findings from the best deep-frying treatment indicated that all olive oil categories exhibited high scavenging radical activity toward DPPH, even in refined olive oil categories and low-quality original olive oil due to the addition of HTyr. In conclusion, deep-fried EVOOs enriched with HTyr at 170 °C/3 h are thermally stable, exhibiting low hydrolysis, low oxidation, higher antioxidant potential, and stable chlorophyll and carotenoid levels. The addition of HTyr to deep-frying oils not only enhances the health benefits of EVOO, supporting EFSA health claims but also acts as a promising stabilizer for the olive oil industry, particularly under high-temperature processing conditions over prolonged periods. This highlights its potential for industrial use as a natural alternative to synthetic antioxidants, not only for olive oil but also for other edible oils, with practical applications in the food industry to improve the quality and stability of frying oils."

These reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed during long-term storage in olive oil (OO), the structural properties of which extend the ROS lifespan more effectively than those of other vegetable oils. In wound treatment, superoxide anions serve as precursors for hydrogen peroxide and play a crucial role in cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. These anions were encapsulated within the OO medium for crystallization. Piezoelectric actuators were employed to distribute the trapped bubbles evenly throughout the crystallized OO. The ROS-filled OO microcapsules eliminated volatile organic compounds and particulate matter (from the air). Samples stored in crystallized OO were utilized to investigate the antibacterial effects. Both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were implicated in skin infections (with S. aureus as the primary pathogen and E. coli as the secondary pathogen) and were selected for antibacterial testing. Microcapsules applied to cultured E. coli and S. aureus resulted in different inhibition zones. Two groups [control (C-) and treatment (T-)] of second-degree burn wounds were created on the dorsal area of 15 Wistar rats. Over a period of 2 weeks, statistical analysis using a t-test demonstrated a significant reduction in the wound size in the T-zones. Histological examination with hematoxylin, eosin, and trichrome staining of tissue samples from the wound areas revealed a notable reduction in inflammation, enhanced epidermal cell proliferation, improved activity in producing hair follicles, and increased collagen deposition in the treated regions on different days of observation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis, particularly postmenopausal osteoporosis, is a significant global health challenge with limited treatment options due to severe side effects associated with the long-term use of conventional therapies. Therefore, this study aims to provide a potentially novel therapeutic approach by examining olive oil's effects on bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical markers, biomechanical properties, and histopathological changes in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. METHODS: In this study, Twenty-four 6-month-old female Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four equal groups (n = 6 rats, for each group): control group, rats given 1mL/100g olive oil, ovariectomized rats (OVX-group), and OVX rats treated with olive oil. The femoral bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical parameters, biomechanical properties, and histopathological features were studied. RESULTS: After 3 months of extra virgin olive oil treatment, there were significant improvements in the different estimated parameters. This was demonstrated by preventing the changes in bone remodeling and BMD, improving the hormonal changes, oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, and abnormal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with OVX-induced osteoporosis. In addition, there was a marked improvement in the histological architecture of the cancellous and cortical bone appearance. CONCLUSION: Olive oil dietary intake effectively reduces the impact of osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy in rats, suggesting a potentially feasible treatment option for postmenopausal osteoporosis that benefits bone architecture without any detrimental side effects on women's health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: The global shift toward sustainable and organic alternatives in cosmetics and personal care has created a demand for innovative and environmentally conscious formulations. This study aimed to develop novel natural ointments using beeswax and grape seed (GS) and pomegranate peel (PP) extracts infused in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and determine the physicochemical characteristics, microbiological properties, and antioxidant activity as a way to valorize organic waste toward its application in the cosmetic industry. The research aimed to promote sustainability and effectiveness in the cosmetic industry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microbial analysis was performed on the oils and ointments, followed by the extraction of active compounds using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The chemical profiles of the extracts were analyzed through thin-layer chromatography, while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed for compound identification and quantification. In vitro assays were conducted to assess the antioxidant activity of the extracts. The physical properties of the formulated ointments (organoleptic properties, homogeneity, pH, water resistance, skin absorption, topical sensitivity, and stability) were evaluated for potential topical applications. RESULTS: The DMSO extracts from the GSs and PP-infused EVOO exhibited significant antioxidant activity. The GC-MS analysis revealed an increase in oleic acid content, ranging from 61.46% in pure EVOO to 72.49% in the infused samples, enhancing their suitability for skin health. The ointments demonstrated favorable physical properties. Microbial analysis confirmed no detectable contamination, ensuring the safety of the formulations for topical use. CONCLUSION: The EVOO-based ointments enriched with GS and PP extracts exhibited strong antioxidant activity, stability, water resistance, and moisturizing properties. The use of phenolic compounds and natural ingredients like beeswax and olive oil underscores the potential of agricultural byproducts in creating sustainable, ecofriendly cosmetics, with promising applications in skincare and therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Compounds originating from plants, especially citrus fruits and olive oil, have anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and antioxidant characteristics. Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline antineoplastic, induces cardiotoxicity by generating free radicals. This study aimed to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of orange (OP) and lemon (LP) peels and olive oil (OO) against DOX-induced myocardial damage in rats. METHODS: Thirty adult male albino rats were randomly assigned to five groups, with six rats in each group. The control group was labeled Group I (Cnt), while Group II (DOX) got DOX intraperitoneally. Groups III, IV, and V were given a combination of DOX with OP, LP, or OO, respectively. After 28 days, cardiac biomarkers (AST, LDH, CK, cTnT), oxidative stress markers (NO, MDA), antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx), apoptotic genes (Bax, caspase 3, Bcl2), NFκB and inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL1β) were assessed. Histopathological analysis of the heart was also conducted. RESULTS: DOX-treated rats showed significant functional and structural cardiac damage, characterized by elevated AST, LDH, CK, cTnT, NO, MDA, Bax, caspase 3, NFκB, TNFα, IL1β and reduced SOD, CAT, GPx, and Bcl2 levels. These rats exhibited myocardial necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, mitochondrial damage, and myofibril atrophy. Treatment with OP, LP, or OO mitigated these effects, with OO providing the most substantial protection. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that OP, LP, or OO can reduce DOX-induced cardiac toxicity by decreasing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation."

      "abstract": "Cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction is an important feature of aged heart. However, there is still no potent agent to ameliorate cardiac function abnormalities in aged hosts. Olive oil (OLO), containing monounsaturated fatty acids, has diverse protective effects on the cardiovascular system, including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypertensive effects. We evaluated the beneficial impacts of OLO against aging-related cardiac dysfunction. Wistar rats were randomly allotted into three groups with eight rats, including control, aged rats receiving D-galactose (D-GAL), and aged rats administrated with D-galactose plus OLO (D-GAL + OLO). Aged animals were received D-GAL at a dose of 150.00 mg kg-1 daily through intra-peritoneal injection for aging induction. The animals in D-GAL + OLO group were co-administrated with oral OLO at a dose of 1.00 mL kg-1 by gavage feeding daily. The administration term was eight weeks. A histological examination of heart tissue was performed. The heart tissues were also harvested to assay the oxidative stress and molecular parameters. The aged animals showed cardiac hypertrophy, increased malondialdehyde level and Bax expression, and reduced mitofusin 2, phosphatase and tensin homologue-induced putative kinase 1, dynamin-related protein 1, and Bcl2 expressions in comparison with the control animals. The OLO treatment ameliorated all these parameters. Overall, OLO could improve cardiac aging through reducing oxidative stress, enhancing genes mediated mitophagy, and improving genes mediated apoptosis in the heart."

Strong experimental data also link paternal preconception nutrition with pathophysiology in the offspring, but the mechanism(s) routing effects of paternal exposures remain elusive. Animal experimental models have highlighted small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as potential regulators of paternal effects. Here, we characterised the baseline sncRNA landscape of human sperm and the effect of a 6-week dietary intervention on their expression profile. This study involves sncRNAseq profiling, that was performed on a subset (n = 17) of the participants enrolled in the PREPARE trial: 9 from the control group and 8 from the intervention group. 5'tRFs, miRNAs and piRNAs were the most abundant sncRNA subtypes identified; their expression was associated with age, BMI, and sperm quality. Nutritional intervention with olive oil, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids altered expression of 3 tRFs, 15 miRNAs and 112 piRNAs, targeting genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and transposable elements in the sperm genome.

      "abstract": "Olive mill wastewater (OMWW), a by-product of olive oil production, poses severe environmental challenges due to its toxicity, primarily caused by its high organic load and phenolic compounds, along with organic acids, lipids, and heavy metals. These components contribute to its elevated chemical and biological oxygen demand, making OMWW a persistent pollutant that necessitates urgent and effective treatment strategies. The ecological risks, including water contamination, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss, underscore the need for sustainable management approaches. This review explores the composition and toxicity of OMWW, examining advanced treatment technologies, e.g., bioremediation, membrane filtration, advanced oxidation processes, and integrated systems that enhance efficiency while minimizing environmental impact. In addition, this study investigates the potential for OMWW valorization as a rich source of polyphenols with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. These bioactive compounds have significant economic value in industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and functional foods. By evaluating sustainable extraction techniques and integrating advanced treatments with economic valorization, OMWW can be transformed from an environmental pollutant into a valuable resource. Such integrated approaches support a circular economy within the olive oil industry, reducing its ecological footprint and fostering sustainable development.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia is a pathological condition characterized by complete blood and oxygen supply deprivation to neuronal tissue. The ischemic brain compensates for the rapid decline in ATP levels by increasing the anaerobic glycolysis rate, which leads to lactate accumulation and subsequent acidosis. Astrocytes play a critical role in regulating cerebral energy metabolism. Mitochondria are significant targets in hypoxia-ischemia injury, and disruptions in mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular energetics worsen outcomes, especially in the elderly. Elevated levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protect the adult and neonatal brain from ischemic damage by suppressing inflammation, countering oxidative stress, supporting neurovascular unit reconstruction, and promoting oligodendrogenesis. This study examines extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) treatment on TNC WT and TNC M23 cells, focusing on oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This study investigates the effects of different durations of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and EVOO administration on cerebral infarct volume, neurological scores, mitochondrial function, and cell viability. Cerebral infarct volume increased with longer ischemia times, while EVOO treatment (0.5 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced infarction across all MCAo durations. The oxygen consumption assays demonstrate EVOO's dose-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial respiration in astrocytes, particularly at lower concentrations. Furthermore, EVOO-treated cells reduce ROS production during hypoxia, improve cell viability under ischemic stress, and enhance ATP production in ischemic conditions, underscoring EVOO's neuroprotective potential.",

Recent findings emphasize the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of bioactive natural compounds, such as polyphenols extracted from plants and fruits, and their possible synergistic effect when used in combination with current therapies to improve the prognosis and symptoms of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Here, we report that Sicilian extra virgin olive oil polyphenol-enriched extracts (PE-EVOOs) reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from both RA patients and healthy subjects (HSs) treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as a control. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis highlighted that PE-EVOOs are rich in different polyphenolic compounds responsible for many of the observed biological effects. At molecular levels, Western blotting analyses revealed that PE-EVOO treatment is associated with the downregulation of the phosphorylated and active form of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and the pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). In addition, PE-EVOOs upregulated the transcription factor Nrf2 and its target antioxidant enzyme catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Collectively, these results suggest a possible use of PE-EVOOs as potential adjuvants for the treatment of RA."

The study involved treatment of seventy adult male rats followed by examination of their testis. The rats were divided into four groups (I-V), each contained 20 rats except group II which contained 10 rats. Each of groups (I, III, IV) was subdivided equally into two subgroups (A and B). Rats in group I did not receive any treatment (IA) or injected intraperitoneal (IP) with 0.5 ml of distilled water daily for two weeks (IB). Rats in group II were gavaged 0.4 ml EVOO daily for 2 weeks. Rats in group III injected IP daily for 2 weeks with 0.5 ml distilled water containing 1 mg CuO NPs (subgroup IIIA) and 4 mg CuO NPs (IIIB). Rats in group IV were gavaged 0.4 ml EVOO before IP injected daily for 2 weeks with 0.5 ml distilled water containing either 1 mg CuO NPs (subgroup IVA) or 4 mg CuO NPs (IVB). After treatment, morphological, histological and biochemical studies on the testes were conducted. Examination of CuO NPs treated groups revealed dose dependant increase in pathological changes. These changes were reduced body weight, distorted basement membranes of seminiferous tubules and degeneration of seminiferous cells. Co-administration of EVOO ameliorated most pathological changes. We concluded that CuO NPs induced deteriorating changes in rats' testes which were improved after co-administration of EVOO.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction, resulting in hyperglycemia. Olive oil, a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet, has attracted considerable attention due to its potential health benefits, including reducing the risk of developing T2DM. This literature review aims to critically examine and synthesize existing research regarding the impact of olive oil on the expression of genes relevant to T2DM. This paper also seeks to provide an immunological and genetic perspective on the signaling pathways of the main components of extra virgin olive oil. Key bioactive components of olive oil, such as oleic acid and phenolic compounds, were identified as modulators of insulin signaling. These compounds enhanced the insulin signaling pathway, improved lipid metabolism, and reduced oxidative stress by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Additionally, they were shown to alleviate inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. Furthermore, these bioactive compounds were observed to mitigate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by downregulating stress markers, thereby protecting beta cells from apoptosis and preserving their function. In summary, olive oil, particularly its bioactive constituents, has been demonstrated to enhance insulin sensitivity, protect beta cell function, and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress by modulating key genes involved in these processes. These findings underscore olive oil's therapeutic potential in managing T2DM. However, further research, including well-designed human clinical trials, is required to fully elucidate the role of olive oil in personalized nutrition strategies for the prevention and treatment of T2DM.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were included in this study and assigned into three groups. In Group I, Group II, and Group III, SRP was done followed by subgingival application of ozonated olive oil, plain olive oil, and chlorhexidine gel in Group I, II, and III, respectively, at baseline 7, 14, and 21 days. Recordings of clinical parameters (gingival index [GI], probing pocket depth [PPD], clinical attachment level [CAL]) were done at baseline and one month. RESULTS: The mean GI, PPD, and CAL scores at baseline for Group I was 2.78 ± 0.42, 2.78 ± 0.42, and 2.66 ± 0.38; for Group II was 2.64 ± 0.39, 6.40 ± 0.50, and 6.40 ± 0.50; and for Group III was 6.00 ± 0.00, 6.40 ± 0.50, and 6.40 ± 0.50, and the scores after one month for Group I was 1.10 ± 0.38, 0.21 ± 0.07, and 0.07 ± 0.05; for Group II was 0.05 ± 0.05, 5.40 ± 0.50, and 5.75 ± 0.44; and for Group III was 5.00 ± 0.00, 5.75 ± 0.44, and 5.28 ± 0.45, with the level of significance being (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ozonated olive oil and chlorhexidine gel have shown significant improvement in periodontal health compared to plain olive oil. Ozonated olive oil can be used as local drug delivery (LDD), an adjunct to SRP in chronic periodontitis which is safe and well accepted by patients without any noticeable side effects."

      "abstract": "The effects of ozonation on the Total Polyphenol Content (TPC) of olive oils remain largely unexplored, despite the significant role that polyphenols play in enhancing the health benefits and quality of these oils. Understanding how ozone treatment impacts phenolic compounds is vital, especially considering the documented negative effects of thermal and photochemical oxidation on TPC. The aim of this study was to explore the use of fluorescence spectroscopy combined with chemometrics to develop multivariate models for monitoring the effects of ozonation on TPC and key physicochemical parameters such as the peroxide index (PI), acidity index (AI), iodine value (IV) and viscosity (V) in both, virgin and pomace olive oils. Parallel factor analysis and principal component analysis of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) of ozonated olive oils revealed that as the ozonation process progressed, TPC and fluorescence emission decreased. And, at the same time, ozonation increased the values of oxidation indicators such as PI, AI, viscosity and intensity of the Rayleigh scattering signal. PLS models based on analysis of unfolded EEMs exhibited good predictive performance for PI (R2 = 0.822; RPD > 2.5), and moderate for TPC and V (R2 = 0.792 and 0.753; RPD > 2). In summary, we demonstrated the feasibility of EEM spectroscopy for monitoring the ozonation process. The use of this method can ease the characterization of ozonated olive oils and, additionally, make the analysis more sustainable.",

      "abstract": "Background: This study evaluates the effects of hydroxytyrosol (HT), a component of olive oil, on mammographic breast density reduction. We explored effects of HT on Wnt β-catenin and other pathways involved in cancer stem cell renewal, DNA repair, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Methods: Twenty-five milligrams per day oral dose of HT was given for 12 months in pre- and postmenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer. Out of 51 patients enrolled, 41 completed the study. The annualized percent decrease in maximum mammographic volumetric breast density (max VBD%) between baseline (BL) and end of treatment (EOT) was analyzed. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and multiplex analysis was performed on the breast biopsies to compare the BL with EOT samples. Results: Max VBD% showed a nonsignificant change; however, in women 60 years or older, the max VBD% decrease was significant (3.7%, p = 0.0391), especially in those with high BL mammographic density. Using RNA-Seq, 3330 unique transcripts were identified (p < 0.05). Mitotic telophase/cytokinesis and DNA damage were upregulated, whereas Wnt, Notch, and oxidative stress-induced senescence pathways were downregulated (p < 0.05). These pathways were confirmed by NanoString nCounter where significant decrease in proliferative genes (RELA and CDK4) and Wnt pathway (R-HSA-195721 and R-HAS-201681) was observed (p < 0.05). Conclusions: HT reduced breast density only in women over 60 years, especially in those with high BL breast density. HT also reduced proliferation and affected the Wnt signaling pathway. This study lays the foundation for future larger studies in exploring a natural compound with well tolerability and overall nontoxic profile for chemoprevention of breast cancer.

      "abstract": "This study characterized a novel bacterial lipase with high biotechnological potential, focusing on industrial and environmental applications. Bacterial isolates were screened using olive oil as a substrate, and the strain with the highest hydrolytic halo was identified as Burkholderia sp. via 16S rRNA analysis. The secreted lipase was purified and exhibited high hydrolytic activity, specifically targeting long-chain fatty acids. Gas chromatography analyses confirmed its ability to hydrolyze fatty acids present in olive oil, while kinetic parameters and substrate preferences were assessed using synthetic substrates. Optimal activity was observed at pH 4.5 and temperatures between 40 and 60 °C. The enzyme demonstrated remarkable thermal stability, retaining over 78 % residual activity after 24 h at 30, 40, 60, and even 70 °C. It also displayed broad pH stability, with increased relative activity at pH 6.5 over time. LipBK showed resilience in the presence of metallic ions, salts, EDTA, and non-ionic detergents, with enhanced activity in the presence of additives like KCl, CaCl₂, and Triton X-100. These properties highlight its robustness and suitability for applications in acidic and thermally variable environments, such as biodiesel production, waste treatment, and sustainable industrial processes, contributing to global sustainability goals.",

Hormone replacement therapy is recommended to manage climacteric complications, but it has serious adverse effects. This study, therefore, investigated the potential of supplementing some minerals, vitamins, and natural products like boric acid, magnesium, vitamin D3, and extra virgin olive oil on metabolic status of menopausal ovariectomized rats. Fourty-two female adult rats were randomly assigned to seven groups: a) Sham Control, b) Ovariectomized Control, c) Ovariectomized + Boric acid, d) Ovariectomized + Magnesium, e) Ovariectomized + Vitamin D3, f) Ovariectomized + Extra virgin olive oil, and g) Ovariectomized + Combined treatment groups. Serum inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, serum lipogram pattern, hepatic triglycerides, body weight, fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, leptin, and adiponectin, as well as hepatic insulin signaling cascade, IRS1/pAKT/GLUT4 were measured in each group to assess metabolic function. Results revealed a significant improvement in inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic parameters by individual and concomitant treating ovariectomized rats with boric acid, magnesium, vitamin D3, and extra virgin olive oil. Interestingly, the concurrent use of these supplements displayed a better impact than individual use, suggesting their valuable therapeutic potential for managing metabolic syndrome in menopausal women. However, the necessity of all four supplements for optimal therapeutic effects remains unsubstantiated."

This scoping review sought to systematically search for and synthesise the research on olive oil and its constituents and their impact on mental health, including the presence or absence of a mental illness or the severity or progression of symptoms. PubMed and OVID MEDLINE databases were searched. The following article types were eligible for inclusion: human experimental and observational studies, animal and preclinical studies. Abstracts were screened in duplicate, and data were extracted using a piloted template. Data were analysed qualitatively to assess trends and gaps for further study. The PubMed and OVID MEDLINE search yielded 544 and 152 results, respectively. After full-text screening, forty-nine studies were eligible for inclusion, including seventeen human experimental, eighteen observational and fourteen animal studies. Of these, thirteen human and four animal studies used olive oil as a comparator. Observational studies reported inconsistent results, specifically five reporting higher rates of mental illness, eight reporting lower and five reporting no association with higher olive oil intake. All human experimental studies and nine of ten animal studies that assess olive oil as an intervention reported an improvement of anxiety or depression symptoms. Olive oil may benefit mental health outcomes. However, more experimental research is needed."

      "abstract": "In several physiopathological processes, phosphatidylserine (PS), normally sequestered to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, becomes exposed to the cell surface. In erythrocytes (RBC), PS externalization is a crucial event for the removal of aged/damaged cells but can also be associated with increased prothrombotic activity. Structurally related olive oil antioxidants, including hydroxytyrosol (HT), are able to significantly reduce the percentage of PS-exposing RBC, when cells are exposed to toxic compounds such as the heavy metal mercury (Hg). The aim of the present study was to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect, with a focus on two different phospholipid translocases, the ATP-dependent flippase ATP11C and the calcium-dependent scramblase PLSCR1, which are responsible for PS internalization and exposure, respectively. In addition to HT, its monophenol analogue, tyrosol, and its in vivo metabolite, homovanillic alcohol, were also tested. Our investigation revealed that exposure of human intact RBC to HgCl2 induced a decrease in flippase activity and an increase in scramblase activity, and that all the selected phenols restored the control activity, regardless of their different scavenging properties. Interestingly, all phenols restored the ATP level of control cells, which were significantly reduced by HgCl2 treatment. Conversely, no variation in intracellular calcium was observed under our experimental conditions. Additionally, all phenols restored the glutathione levels, significantly reduced in the presence of HgCl2. In line with the data on the enzymatic activity, Western blotting analysis indicated changes in the membrane expression of the two enzymes, alterations prevented by antioxidant pre-treatment. Finally, molecular docking analysis suggests that the tested antioxidants may be able to directly interact with ATP11C. Our findings provide an experimental basis for the use of olive oil bioactive compounds in nutritional/nutraceutical strategies for the prevention of Hg-related toxicity, particularly in relation to the cardiovascular tissues.",

To fully establish their health-promoting efficacy, additional animal studies and human clinical trials must be conducted, but the sourcing of both compounds at gram scale, reasonable cost, and ease of access remains a challenge. Here, we describe an extraction procedure to obtain OC and OA from the common privet (Ligustrum vulgare), a fast-growing, semi-evergreen shrub. We show that, compared to the olive tree, in addition to its broader geographical distribution, L. vulgare offers the benefit of yielding both OA and OC from its leaves. We also demonstrate the necessity of providing adapted enzymatic conditions during leaf treatment to optimize OC and OA concentrations in the final extracts.",

This study aims to investigate the antifungal potential of ozonated extra-virgin olive oil (EOO) against Candida albicans, with the goal of developing eco-friendly and highly effective treatments based on natural products. Antifungal activity was evaluated via cell viability and biofilm formation assays using Crystal Violet and Sytox green staining. The results showed that EOO reduced C. albicans viability in a dose-dependent manner, achieving over 90% cell death at a 3% (v/v) concentration. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed cell wall structural damage, and ROS levels increased by approximately 60% compared to untreated controls within 10 min of treatment. Additionally, the expression of autophagy-related genes atg-7 and atg-13was upregulated by 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, after 15 min, suggesting a stress-induced cell death response. EOO also significantly inhibited hyphal formation and biofilm development, thus reducing C. albicans pathogenicity while preserving cell biocompatibility. EOO antifungal activity was also observed in the case of Candida glabrata. In conclusion, ozonated olive oil demonstrates potent antifungal activity against C. albicans by reducing cell viability, inhibiting hyphal and biofilm formation, and triggering oxidative stress and autophagy pathways. These findings position EOO as a promising alternative therapy for fungal infections.",

      "abstract": "Currently, industrial water pollution represents a significant global challenge, with the potential to adversely impact human health and the integrity of ecosystems. The continuous increase in global consumption has resulted in an exponential rise in the use of dyes, which have become one of the major water pollutants, causing significant environmental impacts. In order to address these concerns, a number of wastewater treatment methods have been developed, with a particular focus on physicochemical approaches, such as adsorption. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of a bio-based material derived from olive oil pomace (OOP) as an environmentally friendly bio-adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue (MB), a cationic dye commonly found in textile effluents. The biobased material was initially characterized by determining the point of zero charge (pHpzc) and using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis was conducted, evaluating the impact of specific physicochemical parameters on MB adsorption, which included a thorough examination of the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects. The adsorption process was characterized using Langmuir, Freundlich, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and Dubinin Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms. The results suggest that the equilibrium of adsorption is achieved within ca. 200 min, following pseudo-second-order kinetics. The optimal conditions, including adsorbent mass, temperature, bulk pH, and dye concentration, yielded a maximum adsorption capacity of ca. 93% (i.e., 428 mg g-1) for a pomace concentration of 450 mg L-1. The results suggest a monolayer adsorption process with preferential electrostatic interactions between the dye and the pomace adsorbent. This is supported by the application of Langmuir, BET, Freundlich, and D-R isotherm models. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that the adsorption process is spontaneous and exothermic. This work presents a sustainable solution for mitigating MB contamination in wastewater streams while simultaneously valorizing OOP, an agricultural by-product that presents risks to human health and the environment. In conclusion, this approach offers an innovative ecological alternative to synthetic adsorbents."

METHODS: In a 17-year follow-up study involving participants from Castellana Grotte, Italy (2005-2023), we analyzed dietary intake and mortality data. Participants were categorized into three EVOO consumption groups: <30 g/day, 30-50 g/day, and >50 g/day. Mortality Hazard Ratios (HR) and Subdistribution Hazard Ratios (SHR) were calculated to assess the relationship between EVOO intake and all-cause and cancer mortality. RESULTS: Higher EVOO consumption was associated with significantly reduced cancer and all-cause mortality. Specifically, the daily intake of 30-50 g of EVOO was linked to a 24% lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.93), while the consumption of more than 50 g/day was associated with a 20% reduction (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.65-0.98). The most pronounced benefit was observed for gastrointestinal cancers, with a 60% lower mortality risk for those consuming over 50 g/day (SHR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21-0.73). A 50% reduction in mortality risk from other cancers was also noted for the highest consumption category (SHR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the beneficial role of EVOO in reducing cancer mortality, particularly with higher consumption levels. The results underscore EVOO's potential as a dietary intervention for cancer prevention, aligning with the Mediterranean diet's overall health benefits. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms."

However, there is still no potent compound to improve cardiac function abnormalities in aged individuals. Olive oil (OLO), as an oil with monounsaturated fatty acids, has diverse protective effects on the cardiovascular system, including anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and mitigating effects on blood pressure. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effects of OLO against aging-related cardiac dysfunction. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: Control, D-galactose-induced aging rats (D-GAL group), and aging rats treated with OLO (D-GAL + OLO group). Aging in rats was induced by intraperitoneal injection of D-GAL at 150 mg/kg dose for eight weeks and the D-GAL + OLO group was treated with oral OLO by gavage for eight weeks. The heart tissues were harvested to assay the oxidative stress, molecular parameters, and histological analysis. RESULTS: The D-GAL given rats indicated increased cardiomyocyte diameter as cardiac hypertrophy marker (21 ± 0.8, p < 0.001), an increased Malondialdehyde (MDA) level (27 ± 3, p < 0.001), a reduced Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p < 0.001, 18.12 ± 1.3), and reduction in gene expression of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) (p < 0.05, 0.37 ± 0.06), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1α (p < 0.001, 0.027 ± 0.04), and Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial (TFAM) (p < 0.001, 0.023 ± 0.01), Bcl2 (p < 0.001, 0.04 ± 0.004) and an increase in gene expression of Bax (p < 0.001, 23.5 ± 5.4) in comparison with the control animals. Treatment with OLO improved cardiac hypertrophy (14 ± 0.4, p < 0.001), MDA (22 ± 2.5, p < 0.01), SOD (p < 0.001, 34.9 ± 2), SIRT1 (p < 0.05, 1.37 ± 0.46), PGC-1α (p < 0.001, 1.11 ± 0.1), TFAM (p < 0.01, 0.23 ± 0.02), Bcl2 (p < 0.05, 0.35 ± 0.05) and Bax genes (p < 0.01, 0.1 ± 0.03).

Most of the applications described for sterol analysis, including the official method, only allow the determination of the total sterol content but not its distribution in free or esterified form. This work proposes a two-dimensional liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (2D-LC-HRMS) method for the simultaneous analysis of triterpenic alcohols, free sterols and steryl esters. A reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)-RPLC coupling was performed through a multiple heart-cutting interface equipped with an active solvent modulation (ASM) valve. Additionally, a selection valve was coupled to the 2D-LC system, allowing the simultaneous data acquisition from both dimensions in a single analysis. A simplified sample treatment based on solid phase extraction was also proposed to avoid tedious steps such as saponification or derivatization before gas chromatography analysis. To evaluate the content of these compounds in different olive oil categories, the proposed 2D-LC-HRMS system was applied to a set of samples from different commercial olive oil categories (extra virgin olive oil, virgin olive oil, olive oil, pomace olive oil) and sunflower oil. The results revealed significant differences in the distribution of free and esterified sterols of the analyzed samples, highlighting the free/esterified sterol ratio as a powerful tool to unveil olive oil fraud practices and fat manipulation.",

      "abstract": "Ensuring the health of the gums and supporting structures (periodontium) is crucial during dental restoration procedures to achieve optimal function and appearance of the teeth. Understanding the anatomy, the impact of restorative materials, and their interaction with the periodontium is essential for successful treatment outcomes. Crown lengthening is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of gingiva and bone tissue to expose more of the tooth structure, thereby increasing the visible portion of the tooth (clinical crown height). To protect the wound from mechanical trauma and stability of the surgical site during the healing process, periodontal dressing can be applied after surgery. Ozone therapy has demonstrated its effectiveness in promoting the healing of various types of wounds, including chronic and difficult-to-heal wounds, as an antibacterial agent and in modulating the immune system. Thus, this study aimed to compare, evaluate, and assess the use of periodontal dressing with that of ozonated olive oil after the crown lengthening procedure."

Thus, administration of antioxidants could improve diabetic wound healing. This study aimed to understand the effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or hydroxytyrosol (HT) in skin wound healing under diabetic conditions. Skin wounds in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were topically treated with HT. Some diabetic animals were fed with a diet rich in EVOO. Wounds were harvested 7 days later. In in vitro assays, fibroblasts and macrophages were treated with high levels of glucose and HT. The EVOO or HT promoted wound closure and collagen deposition in diabetic mouse wounds. The EVOO or HT reduced the number of infiltrated neutrophils, tumour necrosis factor-α, lipid peroxidation, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in diabetic mouse wounds. The EVOO or HT also increased the number of macrophages with anti-inflammatory phenotype and interleukin-10 in diabetic mouse wounds. In the in vitro assays, HT promoted the fibroblast migration, collagen gel contraction, and switched macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype under high glucose conditions. In conclusion, the diet supplementation with EVOO or topical application of HT promotes skin wound healing under diabetic conditions and can be a possible therapeutic tool for the treatment of those lesions.",

      "abstract": "Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have highlighted its crucial preventive role against cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndrome and cancer, with these effects being due to the synergistic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of minor components, such as polyphenols and tocols. The aim of the present study is to implement new technologies for olive oil mills and develop an efficient large-sized industrial process for the continuous extraction of healthier EVOOs that are enriched with these bioactive compounds. Non-thermal technologies, namely ultrasound (US) and pulsed electric field (PEF), have been tested, separately and in combination, to eliminate the need for traditional malaxation. There is extensive literature to support the efficacy of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and PEF treatments in EVOO production. A newly designed US device and a PEF industrial chamber have been combined into a single, integrated continuous-flow setup, the performance of which in the extraction of EVOO from green Coratina olives has been evaluated herein. Extraction yields, physico-chemical and organoleptic characteristics, and polyphenol and tocol contents were monitored throughout the trials, and the last three were measured at accelerated aging times (AAT) of 15 and 30 days. The US and combined US-PEF processes not only increased daily oil production (ton/day, by nearly 45%), but also eliminated the need for kneading during malaxation, resulting in significant energy savings (approximately 35%). In addition, these innovations enriched the resulting EVOO with nutritionally relevant minor components (8-12% polyphenols, 3-5% tocols), thereby elevating its quality and market value, as well as overall stability. The introduction of continuous-flow US and PEF technologies is a remarkable innovation for the EVOO industry, as they offer benefits to both producers and consumers. The EVOO resulting from non-thermal continuous-flow production meets the growing demand for healthier, nutrient-enriched products."

METHODS: SRAEZZ was prepared from dried stems and roots of Z. zanthoxyloides in a 1:1 proportion and chemically characterized. A total of 30 healthy male Wistar rats (weighing 210-280 g) were randomly assigned to six groups (control, model, capecitabine, and SRAEZZ [50, 100, or 200 mg/kg]). All groups except the control received CCl4/olive oil (3 mL/kg, po) in the morning, whereas in the afternoon of the same dosing day, the model group received normal saline (5 mL/kg, po), the capecitabine group received capecitabine (50 mg/kg, po), and the SRAEZZ groups received SRAEZZ (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg, po, respectively) once per week for 36 days. Survival rate, serum α-fetoprotein (AFP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were monitored. Gross liver anatomy, liver histology, liver enzymes (ALP, AST, and ALT), bilirubin, creatinine, urea, albumin, globulins, and hematological parameters were assessed. RESULTS: SRAEZZ yield was 0.58% from the initial stem and root sample (520 g). Quaternary phenanthridin alkaloids were detected in SRAEZZ. Control rats had a 100% survival rate compared with rats in the model group. SRAEZZ treatment improved the survival rate with respect to that in the model group. Serum AFP, CRP, and bilirubin levels were greater in the model group than the control group. SRAEZZ decreased serum AFP, CRP, and bilirubin below the levels observed in the model group. ALP, AST, and AST were higher in the model group, but lower in SRAEZZ-treated group, than the control group. CONCLUSION: SRAEZZ demonstrated prophylactic anti-HCC effects against CCl4/olive oil-induced HCC-like phenotypes in rats. These findings highlight the potential of crude alkaloids from Z. zanthoxyloides as natural templates for semi-synthesis of anti-HCC pharmacotherapeutics."

      "abstract": "The identification of archaeological biomarkers is one of the main objectives of analytical chemistry in the archaeological field. However, no information is currently available on biomarkers able to unambiguously indicate the presence of olive oil, a cornerstone of Mediterranean ancient societies lifestyle, in an organic residue. This study aims to bridge this gap by a thorough characterization of the degradation products of extra-virgin olive oils (EVOOs) resulting from in-lab thermal oxidative treatments, with the primary goal of revealing potential archaeological biomarkers for olive oil. Thirty-three EVOOs sourced from eleven different monocultivars across five Italian regions (Sicily, Apulia, Lazio, Tuscany, and Liguria) and Spain, were analyzed before and after thermal oxidation. In addition, an identical thermal treatment was employed on pure triglyceride standards (triolein, trilinolein, and tristearin), due to the high concentration of their fatty acids in EVOO discerning their degradation patterns. A combination of analytical strategies was employed, including HPLC-MS and HPLC-ELSD for the complete evaluation of the intact lipids (triglycerides, diglycerides, and their oxidative species) in olive oils before and after oxidation, and HS-SPME-GC-MS and GC-FID for the characterization of secondary oxidation products formed by the thermal treatment. In addition, to elucidate the fatty acid distribution in the oxidized EVOOs by GC-MS and GC-FID techniques a derivatization step was performed to convert lipid compounds into trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. A chemometric approach was used to thoroughly interpret the data obtained from intact and oxidized samples. This comprehensive investigation sheds light on the chemical transformations of EVOOs under thermal oxidative conditions and indicates mono-carboxylic acids such as pentanoic, hexanoic, heptanoic, octanoic, nonanoic, and decanoic acids as potential archaeological biomarkers for the presence of lipid substances coming from olive oil in archaeological organic residues. Finally, lipid contents from twenty-four real archaeological samples, grouped in amphorae (10), unguentaria (5), and lamps (9), excavated from the Roman domus of Villa San Pancrazio in Taormina (Italy), were determined. The analytical results obtained from amphorae samples revealed the presence of the selected olive oil-specific archaeological biomarkers, an information extremely interesting considering that this type of amphorae have so far been solely associated with the storage of wine.",

A total of 280 healthy shrimps (3.42 ± 0.02 g) were randomly distributed into five equal groups and were fed diets containing 0 (CUR-OLNE0), 5(CUR-OLNE5), 10(CUR-OLNE10), 15(CUR-OLNE15) and 20 (CUR-OLNE20) mg CUR-OLNE/kg diet, respectively for 16 weeks. Among CUR-OLNE treated groups, CUR-OLNE20 showed the highest growth performance and feed utilization traits, including final body weight, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, and protein efficiency ratio. Notably, the photomicrographs provided further compelling evidence regarding the potential effect of CUR-OLNE supplementation on muscle structure and integrity. Compared to the control, the levels of blood protein significantly induced in CUR-OLNE15 and CUR-OLNE20 treated groups (p < 0.05). All CUR-OLNE -supplemented groups possessed lower activities of liver enzymes as well as the levels of urea and creatinine compared to the control (p < 0.05). The addition of 20 mg CUR-OLNE/kg diet decreased the concentrations of cortisol, glucose and triglycerides. The dietary treatment significantly improved the secretion of digestive enzymes, including amylase, lipase, and protease. The lowest levels of Malondialdehyde and the highest levels of total antioxidant capacity, super oxide dismutase, catalase, lysozyme and immunoglobulin M were detected in both of CUR-OLNE15, and CUR-OLNE20 treated groups compared to the control (p < 0.05). There were considerable significant effects of dietary supplementation of CUR-OLNE on economic efficiency. In conclusion, the application of nanocarriers for the delivery of dietary immune stimulants such as CUR-OLNE to Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp is a promising strategy for improving shrimp nutrition. The addition of 20 mg CUR-OLNE/kg to the diets of can be recommended as an affective intervention to improve growth performance, feed utilization, and health status of shrimp. Implementing this intervention can maximize the economic efficiency of shrimp farming while promoting sustainable practices in the industry.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Olive oil is a vegetable oil that provides health benefits, including a reduction in free radicals and total cholesterol and prevention of chronic diseases. The escalating incidence of chronic diseases presents a substantial challenge to public health, prompting numerous studies to assess these health-related effects. Despite several systematic reviews and meta-analyses summarizing the association between olive oil consumption and specific health outcomes, there is no summary of the accumulated evidence from these reviews. OBJECTIVE: This umbrella review summarizes the evidence on olive oil consumption or intervention in adults and its association with multiple risk factors and diseases. DATA SOURCES: We retrieved systematic reviews of randomized trials or observational studies on oral interventions or the consumption of olive oil. The systematic search encompassed databases including MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, and CENTRAL from inception to February 6, 2023. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers conducted data extraction and assessed methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool. DATA ANALYSIS: Overall, 17 systematic reviews of randomized trials and observational studies, covering outcomes such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, type 2 diabetes, glucose metabolism, inflammatory and oxidative markers, and all-cause mortality, were included. The evidence suggests a beneficial association between olive oil consumption and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. However, the evidence was less definitive for inflammatory markers, oxidative stress, glucose metabolism, and blood lipid outcomes. Several meta-analyses revealed high heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals, along with a limited number of randomized clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Given the high heterogeneity and low quality of evidence, further studies involving randomized trials are imperative. Prioritizing an in-depth analysis of specific olive oil components and using a control group with distinct characteristics and different effects is strongly recommended.

Despite its traditional use in aromatherapy and complementary medicine, there is a need for comprehensive investigations into its therapeutic potential, particularly in mitigating DNA damage and supporting health in palliative care settings. This study aimed to evaluate the antigenotoxic effects of lemon essential oil in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to explore its potential applications in palliative care. Treatment with lemon essential oil significantly reduced DNA damage, with 1% w/v with 3.13% DNA in tail demonstrating greater efficacy. Furthermore, lemon essential oil attenuated streptonigrin-induced DNA damage, suggesting a potential protective effect against oxidative stress, especially at 3% w/v, with 11.81% DNA in tail. Compared to olive oil treatment, the DNA damage was significantly lower with streptonigrin treatment alone, which had 47.06% DNA in tail, while the olive oil treatment resulted in 36.88% DNA in tail. These results can be attributed to the main constituents: limonene in lemon essential oil and oleic acid in olive oil. These results suggest a potential role in mitigating oxidative stress and supporting genomic stability. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of action and clinical applications in palliative care."

METHODS: A randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial, in which a new immunomodulatory formula with extra virgin olive oil was compared with a standard isoprotein and isoenergetic formula. Patients with gastric, esophageal or biliopancreatic tumors were recruited to receive two units of immunomodulatory formula or control, 5 days before the surgical intervention. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were recruited. There was a significant reduction in the number of reinterventions (7.7 vs. 20.4%; p = 0.044) in the intervention group. There was a significant reduction in the development of fistulas in patients with phase angles >5.7°. Also, there were fewer readmissions after biliopancreatic surgeries (0.0 vs. 100%; p = 0.014). The length of hospital stay was similar between groups; however, with the immunomodulatory formula, the patients exhibited greater phase angle at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSION: The immunomodulatory formula with extra virgin olive oil administered 5 days before surgery for stomach, esophageal and biliopancreatic tumors improved cellular health and reduced postoperative complications.Clinical trial registration: [https://clinicaltrials.gov/], identifier [NCT04027088]."

METHODS: The study was conducted on 32 New Zealand White rabbits. The randomly numbered subjects were divided into two main groups. The rabbits numbered 1 to 16 were selected to be the group to receive EVOO, and the remaining were selected into a control group. Both groups were separated into two subgroups for short-term (five weeks) and long-term (10 weeks) follow-up. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was applied on the left knees of all the rabbits via medial parapatellar arthrotomy to simulate knee instability. Immediately after the surgical procedure, 0.2 cc of EVOO was injected into the knee joint of rabbits numbered 1-16, and the control group received 0.2 cc of sterile saline. On the 14th day, long-term group subjects were administered another dose of 0.2 cc EVOO intraarticularly. RESULTS: The gross morphological scores of the control group subjects were significantly different from the EVOO group for both short-term (p = 0,055) and long-term (p = 0,041) scores. In parallel, the MRI results of the EVOO subjects were significantly different from the control group for both short-term and long-term follow-up assessment scores (p = 0.017, p = 0.014, respectively). The Mankin scoring results showed that there were statistically significant differences between the EVOO and control group in the comparison of both total scores (p = 0.001 for short-term and p = 0.004 for long-term) and subgroup scoring, including macroscopic appearance, chondrocyte cell number, staining, and Tidemark integrity in both short-term (p = 0.005, p = 0.028, p = 0.001, p = 0.005, respectively) and long-term assessments (p = 0.002, p = 0.014, p < 0.001, p = 0. 200, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We have observed promising outcomes of intra-articular application of extra virgin olive oil in the treatment of acute degenerative osteoarthritis in rabbit knees. Due to its potential cartilage restorative and regenerative effects, EVOO, when administered intra-articularly, may be a promising agent to consider for further research in the treatment of OA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic intake of extra virgin olive oil is beneficial for brain health and protects from age-related cognitive decline and dementia, whose most common clinical manifestation is Alzheimer's disease. Besides the classical pathologic deposits of amyloid beta peptides and phosphorylated tau proteins, another frequent feature of the Alzheimer's brain is neuroinflammation. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we assessed the effect that extra virgin olive oil has on neuroinflammation when administered to a mouse model of the disease. METHODS: Triple transgenic mice were randomized to receive a diet enriched with extra virgin olive oil or regular diet for 8 weeks. At the end of this treatment period the expression level of several inflammatory biomarkers was assessed in the central nervous system. RESULTS: Among the 79 biomarkers measured, compared with the control group, mice receiving the extra virgin olive oil had a significant reduction in MIP-2, IL-17E, IL-23, and IL-12p70, but an increase in IL-5. To validate these results, specific ELISA kits were used for each of them. Confirmatory results were obtained for MIP-2, IL-17E, IL-23, and IL-12-p70. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for IL-5. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that chronic administration of extra virgin olive oil has a potent anti-neuroinflammatory action in a model of Alzheimer's disease. They provide additional pre-clinical support and novel mechanistic insights for the beneficial effect that this dietary intervention has on brain health and dementia.",

The experiment used medical grade five titanium discs on which peri-implant isolated biofilms were grown. The experimental groups were control, Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Granulicatella adiacens (G. adiacens), (n = 6). The oral microbes grown on titanium discs were exposed to ozone gel for 3 minutes and the antibacterial activity was assessed by turbidity test and adherence test for the antibiofilm activity test. Bacterial morphology and confluence were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), (n=3). Two bacterial species were identified from the peri-implant sample, S. mutans and G. adiacens. The results showed that adding ozone to the bacterial biofilm on titanium dental implants did not exhibit significant antibacterial activity against S. mutans. Moreover, there was no significant difference in antibiofilm activity between control and treatment groups. However, significant antibacterial and antibiofilm effect was exhibited by ozone gel against G. adiacens. Ozonated olive oil can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for disinfecting dental implant surfaces and treating peri-implantitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gingival inflammation, a hallmark of periodontal diseases, serves as a critical focus in oral health research. Characterized by redness, swelling, and bleeding of the gingival tissues, it reflects the body's response to bacterial biofilms accumulating on the tooth surfaces. This inflammatory process, initiated by the interaction between oral bacteria and the host immune system, can lead to a spectrum of periodontal conditions ranging from mild gingivitis to severe periodontitis. Understanding the efficacy of various methods to treat gingival inflammation is essential for refining treatment strategies and enhancing patient satisfaction in the realm of gingival inflammation. AIM: The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of employing the microneedling technique with olive oil on gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation in individuals with gingivitis.  Materials and methods:Twenty-four individuals diagnosed with plaque-induced gingivitis were selected from Saveetha Dental College, Chennai. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A, comprising 12 individuals who received mechanical periodontal treatment only and Group B, consisting of 12 individuals treated with dermapen and topical olive oil. This involved the creation of microholes in the gingival tissue to enhance the concentration and penetration of the oils through the gingival tissues. Post-intervention assessments of gingival and plaque status were conducted using a gingival index and a plaque index at baseline, one, two, and four weeks. Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Intergroup analysis was done using Mann-Whitney test and intra-group analysis was done using Kruskal-Wallis test for all the study parameters. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: The mean plaque index scores were 2.02 ± 0.12 and 2.29 ± 0.21 in the subgingival scaling and microneedling with olive oil group respectively in baseline. The scores were 1.83 ± 0.29 and 0.57 ± 0.16 in the subgingival scaling and microneedling with olive oil group respectively at the end of four weeks. The results of plaque index scores were statistically significant between the control and the intervened groups at the end of four weeks with a p value of 0.01*. The mean gingival index scores were 2.09 ± 0.16 and 2.37 ± 0.17 in the subgingival scaling and microneedling with olive oil group in the baseline respectively. The scores were 1.88 ± 0.23 and 0.96 ± 0.21 in the subgingival scaling and microneedling with olive oil group respectively at the end of four weeks. The results of gingival index scores were statistically significant between the control and the intervened groups at the end of four weeks with a p value of 0.01*. CONCLUSION: Our research showcased a novel and effective technique, unveiling a significant enhancement in gingival health accompanied by a reduction in both the average gingival index and plaque index."

In the present study, the anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic and histo-protective effects of the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) enriched with the organosulfur diallyl sulfide (DAS) (DAS-rich EVOO) were evaluated in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The ingestion of EVOO (500µL daily for two weeks) attenuated alloxan-induced elevated glucose, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea and creatinine. It also normalized the levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterols (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) and their consequent atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) in diabetic animals. Additionally, EVOO prevented lipid peroxidation (MDA) and reduced the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in diabetic animals. Concomitantly, it enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), reducing thereby tissue oxidative stress injury. The overall histologic (pancreas, liver, and kidney) alterations were also improved after EVOO ingestion. The manifest anti-diabetic, lipid-lowering and histo-protective properties of EVOO were markedly potentiated with DAS-rich EVOO suggesting possible synergistic interactions between DAS and EVOO lipophilic bioactive ingredients. Overall, EVOO and DAS-rich EVOO show promise as functional foods and/or adjuvants for the treatment of diabetes and its complications.",

      "abstract": "Olive oil (Olea europaea) is one of the major components of the Mediterranean diet and is composed of a greater percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid; polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid; and minor compounds, such as phenolic compounds, and particularly hydroxytyrosol. The latter, in fact, are of greater interest since they have found widespread use in popular medicine. In recent years, it has been documented that phenolic acids and in particular hydroxytyrosol have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiproliferative action and therefore interest in their possible use in clinical practice and in particular in neoplasms, both solid and hematological, has arisen. This work aims to summarize and analyze the studies present in the literature, both in vitro and in vivo, on the possible use of minor components of olive oil in some hematological neoplasms. In recent years, in fact, interest in nutraceutical science has expanded as a possible adjuvant in the treatment of neoplastic pathologies. Although it is worth underlining that, regarding the object of our study, there are still few preclinical and clinical studies, it is, however, possible to document a role of possible interest in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is a fat source classified as monounsaturated fatty acid. Previous studies have shown that 47.5% of breastfeeding mothers have less fat intake when compared to the Adequacy of Nutrition Rate (RDA). EVOO consumption can improve the composition of breast milk. However, no research has been found regarding the body composition of breastfeeding mothers after consuming EVOO. This study aims to determine the effect of EVOO on the body composition of breastfeeding mothers 0-24 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted at the Sudiang Raya and Tamalanrea Health Centers in Makassar City with a randomized clinical trial design from January to February 2023. The sample was breastfeeding mothers 0-24 months divided into the intervention group (EVOO and Nutrition Education, n = 17) and the control (Nutrition Education, n = 17). Instruments with Bioelectrical Impedence Analysis tools. Data analysis using t-test. RESULTS: The sample is breastfeeding mothers aged between ≤19 and >35 years. The results of the analysis showed that the average pre-post test, % fat mass (FM) P = 0.426 and % fat free mass (FFM) P = 0.508 (P > 0.05), meant that there was no significant difference. Between the two groups there was no significant difference at the end of the study, %FM P = 0.469 and %FFM P = 0.529 (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the intervention group that was given EVOO, it was possible to maintain%FM and%FFM in the normal percentage range, while in the control group, there was a decrease from the normal to less/low range."

It has been demonstrated that the consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with a high content of phenolic compounds is beneficial in the prevention and/or treatment of many diseases. The main objective of this work was to study the relationship between the content of phenolic compounds and the in vitro neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity of EVOOs from two PDOs in the province of Granada. To this purpose, the amounts of phenolic compounds were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and the inhibitory activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes by spectrophotometric and fluorimetric assays. The main families identified were phenolic alcohols, secoiridoids, lignans, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. The EVOO samples with the highest total concentration of compounds and the highest inhibitory activity belonged to the Picual and Manzanillo varieties. Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between identified compounds and AChE and COX-2 inhibitory activity, except for lignans. These results confirm EVOO's compounds possess neuroprotective potential.",

The present study aimed to analyze the effects of PEF on oil yield, quality, and in vitro antioxidant activity of \"Koroneiki\" extra virgin olive oil. The results show that the PEF treatment increased the oil yield by 5.6%, but had no significant effect on the saponification value, K232, K270, and ∆K value of the VOO. PEF treatment reduced the oleic acid content by 3.12%, but had no significant effect on the content of palmitic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid. After PEF treatment, the levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and oleuropein increased by 7.6%, 18.3% and 76%, respectively. There was no significant effect on the levels of 4 phenolic acids (vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and cinnamic acid), 2 lignans (lignans and apigenin), hydroxytyrosol, and 3 pigments (lutein, demagnetized chlorophyll, and carotenoids). In addition, PEF treatment significantly increased the content of tocopherols, with α, β, γ, and δ tocopherols increasing by 9.8%, 10.7%, 13.6% and 38.4%, respectively. The free radical scavenging ability of DPPH and ABTS was also improved. In conclusion, the use of PEF significantly increased the yield of VOO oil as well as the levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, oleuropein, tocopherol, and in vitro antioxidant activity."

METHODS: A randomized, three-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was performed that lasted 8 weeks. Blood and stools were collected and analyzed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the intake of the enriched yogurt resulted in a significant increase in the levels of Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens group and Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. On the other hand, a significant increase in the levels of Lactobacillus and C. perfringens group was detected after the intake of the plain yogurt. The increase in the levels of C. perfringens group was inversely associated with the plasma catabolic enzyme of PAF, namely LpPLA2 (lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), a cardiovascular risk marker that has been linked with inflammation and atherosclerosis. Moreover, in the enriched with PAF-R antagonists yogurt group, the increased levels of C. perfringens group were also associated with lower PAF action assessed as ex vivo human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) aggregation. Additionally, a higher % increase in molar ratio of Branched Short Chain Fatty Acids (BSCFAs) was detected for both yogurt groups after the 8 week-intervention compared to control. The consumption of the enriched yogurt also resulted in a significant drop in faecal caproic levels and a trend for lower ratio of butyrate to total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) compared to baseline levels. CONCLUSION: Yogurt consumption seems to favorably affect gut microbiota while its enrichment with PAF-R antagonists from olive oil by-products, may provide further benefits in healthy overweight subjects.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methylprednisolone (MP) is a pharmaceutical agent employed in the management of Leukemia, which is a systemic malignancy that arises from abnormalities in the hematological system. Numerous investigations in the field of cancer research have directed their attention towards propolis, a natural substance with significant potential as a treatment-supportive agent. Its utilization aims to mitigate the potential adverse effects associated with chemotherapy medications. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of olive oil-based propolis (OEP) and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) on the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, as well as to determine if they exhibit a synergistic effect when combined with the therapeutic support product methylprednisolone. METHODS AND RESULTS: The proliferation of HL-60 cells was quantified using the WST-8 kit. The PI Staining technique was employed to do cell cycle analysis of DNA in cells subjected to OEP, CAPE, and MP, with subsequent measurement by flow cytometry. The apoptotic status of cells was determined by analyzing them using flow cytometry after staining with the Annexin V-APC kit. The quantification of apoptotic gene expression levels was conducted in HL-60 cells. In HL-60 cells, the IC50 dosages of CAPE and MP were determined to be 1 × 10- 6 M and 5 × 10- 4 M, respectively. The HL-60 cells were subjected to apoptosis and halted in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle after being treated with MP, CAPE, and OEP. CONCLUSIONS: Propolis and its constituents have the potential to serve as effective adjunctive therapies in chemotherapy.",

Dietary lipids play a role in inflammation and its resolution. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of DHA and olive oil on the birth weight of pups born to alcohol-exposed dams. METHODS: Pregnant rats were randomized to the control or three treatment (alcohol) groups. From gestational days (GD) 8-19, the control group received daily olive oil and malto/dextrose, whereas groups 2 and 3 received olive oil and low-dose alcohol or high-dose alcohol, respectively. Group 4 received daily DHA and high-dose alcohol. The dam's blood was collected on GD 15 and 20 for cytokine analysis. Dams were sacrificed on GD 20. The mean birth weight of pups was compared by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Duncan's test. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the pups' mean birth weight in the high-dose alcohol/DHA and high-dose alcohol/olive oil. Higher pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-12p70) were noted in the alcohol-exposed dams. CONCLUSIONS: DHA and olive oil supplementation in alcohol-exposed pregnant rats significantly increased their pups' birth weight despite having high pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism of this effect remains to be determined."

      "abstract": "Pesticide residues may be present in olive oil because pesticides are applied to olive trees during their cultivation and growth for pest prevention and some of these pesticides are not easily degraded. Studies on pesticide residues in olive oil have mainly focused on the detection of single types of pesticide residues, and reports on the simultaneous detection of multiple pesticide residues are limited. At present, hundreds of pesticides with different polarities and chemical properties are used in practice. In this study, an analytical method based on fully automatic QuEChERS pretreatment instrument coupled with gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF-MS) was established for the rapid determination of 222 pesticide residues in olive oil. The effects of acetonitrile acidification concentration, n-hexane volume, oscillation time, centrifugation temperature, and purification agent on the determination of the 222 pesticide residues were investigated. First, ions with good responses and no obvious interference were selected for quantification and characterization. The purification process was then developed by setting the parameters of the fully automatic QuEChERS pretreatment instrument to optimal values. The sample was extracted with acetonitrile containing 2% formic acid, and the supernatant was purified by centrifugation in a centrifuge tube containing 400 mg N-propylethylenediamine (PSA), 400 mg octadecylsilane-bonded silica gel (C18), and 1200 mg anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The purified solution was blown dry with nitrogen and then fixed with ethyl acetate for instrumental analysis. Finally, a matrix standard solution was used for quantification. The method was validated in terms of matrix effects, linear ranges, limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs), accuracies, and precisions. The results showed that 86.04% of the 222 pesticides had linear ranges of 0.02-2.00 μg/mL, 10.81% had linear ranges of 0.10-2.00 μg/mL, and 3.15% had linear ranges of 0.20-2.00 μg/mL. The pesticide residues showed good relationships within their respective linear ranges, and the correlation coefficients (R2) were greater than 0.99. The LODs of all tested pesticides ranged from 0.002 to 0.050 mg/kg, and their LOQs ranged from 0.007 to 0.167 mg/kg. Among the 222 pesticides determined, 170 pesticides had LOQs of 0.007 mg/kg while 21 pesticides had LOQs of 0.017 mg/kg. At the three spiked levels of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 mg/kg, 79.58% of all tested pesticides had average recoveries of 70%-120% while 65.92% had average recoveries of 80%-110%. In addition, 93.54% of all tested pesticides had relative standard deviations (RSDs, n=6)<10% while 98.35% had RSDs (n=6)<20%. The method was applied to 14 commercially available olive oil samples, and seven pesticides were detected in the range of 0.0044-0.0490 mg/kg. The residues of fenbuconazole, chlorpyrifos, and methoprene did not exceed the maximum limits stated in GB 2763-2021. The maximum residual limits of molinate, monolinuron, benalaxyl, and thiobencarb have not been established. The method utilizes the high mass resolution capability of TOF-MS, which can improve the detection throughput while ensuring good sensitivity. In addition, high-resolution and accurate mass measurements render the screening results more reliable, which is necessary for the high-throughput detection of pesticide residues. The use of a fully automatic QuEChERS instrument in the pretreatment step reduces personnel errors and labor costs, especially when a large number of samples must be processed, thereby offering significant advantages over other approaches. Moreover, the method is simple, rapid, sensitive, highly automatable, accurate, and precise. Thus, it meets requirements for the high-throughput detection of pesticide residues in olive oil and provides a reference for the development of detection methods for pesticide residues in other types of oils as well as the automatic pretreatment of complex matrices.",

      "abstract": "In this review, we explored the therapeutic potential of oleuropein (OLE) and hydroxytyrosol (HT) in the treatment of neuroblastoma (NB). NB is an extracranial tumour that predominantly affects children aged between 17 and 18 months. Recurrence and drug resistance have emerged as the biggest challenges when treating NB, leading to a crucial need for new therapeutic approaches. Food of the Mediterranean Diet (MD) presents several health benefits, including that of cancer treatment. In this review, we emphasised olive oil since it is one of the main liquid ingredients of the MD. OLE is the principal phenolic compound that constitutes olive oil and is hydrolysed to produce HT. Considering that tumour cells produce increased amounts of reactive oxygen species, this review highlights the antioxidant properties of OLE and HT and how they could result in increased cellular antioxidant defences and reduced oxidative damage in NB cells. Moreover, we highlight that these phenolic compounds lead to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, reduce the side effects caused by conventional treatments, and activate tumours that become dormant as a resistance mechanism. Future research should explore the effects of these compounds and other antioxidants on the treatment of NB in vivo.",

      "abstract": "Frequent colonization and bacterial infection of skin wounds in small animals prevent or impair their healing. However, the broadly applied antimicrobial therapy of wounds is not always necessary and promotes the spread of bacterial resistance. Thus, alternatives to antimicrobial therapy, including preventive measures in the form of wound dressings with antibiotic properties, should be searched for. The aim of this study was to develop a new, efficient, cost-effective and non-toxic formulation with antimicrobial properties to serve as an alternative to antibiotic administration in wound-healing stimulation in companion animals. Nano/microencapsulated ozonated olive oil in a hyaluronan matrix was developed, with ozone concentration high enough to prevent bacterial growth. The presence and size of nano- and microcapsules were determined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Antibacterial activity of developed formulations was examined in vitro on 101 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the wounds of companion animals. The highest ozone concentration in the developed formulations inhibited the growth of 40.59% bacteria. Species and genus-specific differences in reactions were observed. Enterococcus spp. proved the least susceptible while non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria were the most susceptible to the examined formulations. Changes in the bacterial morphology and cell structure of Psychrobacter sanguinis suspension mixed with Ca-stabilized formulations with nano/microencapsulated ozonized olive oil were revealed during SEM observations. The combination of compounds that promote wound healing (hyaluronic acid, olive oil, ozone and calcium) with the antibacterial activity of the developed formula makes it a promising bionanocomposite for use as a topical dressing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitisis (UC) classified as a form of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by chronic, nonspecific, and recurrent symptoms with a poor prognosis. Common clinical manifestations of UC include diarrhea, fecal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Even though anti-inflammatory drugs can help alleviate symptoms of IBD, their long-term use is limited due to potential side effects. Therefore, alternative approaches for the treatment and prevention of inflammation in UC are crucial. METHODS: This study investigated the synergistic mechanism of Lactobacillus plantarum SC-5 (SC-5) and tyrosol (TY) combination (TS) in murine colitis, specifically exploring their regulatory activity on the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory pathways (NF-κB and MAPK) and key molecular targets (tight junction protein). The effectiveness of 1 week of treatment with SC-5, TY, or TS was evaluated in a DSS-induced colitis mice model by assessing colitis morbidity and colonic mucosal injury (n = 9). To validate these findings, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed by inoculating DSS-treated mice with the microbiota of TS-administered mice (n = 9). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that all three treatments effectively reduced colitis morbidity and protected against DSS-induced UC. The combination treatment, TS, exhibited inhibitory effects on the DSS-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and negatively regulated NF-κB. Furthermore, TS maintained the integrity of the tight junction (TJ) structure by regulating the expression of zona-occludin-1 (ZO-1), Occludin, and Claudin-3 (p < 0.05). Analysis of the intestinal microbiota revealed significant differences, including a decrease in Proteus and an increase in Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia, which supported the protective effect of TS (p < 0.05). An increase in the number of Aspergillus bacteria can cause inflammation in the intestines and lead to the formation of ulcers. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus can regulate the micro-ecological balance of the intestinal tract, replenish normal physiological bacteria and inhibit harmful intestinal bacteria, which can alleviate the symptoms of UC. The relative abundance of Akkermansia has been shown to be negatively associated with IBD. The FMT group exhibited alleviated colitis, excellent anti-inflammatory effects, improved colonic barrier integrity, and enrichment of bacteria such as Akkermansia (p < 0.05). These results further supported the gut microbiota-dependent mechanism of TS in ameliorating colonic inflammation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the TS demonstrated a remission of colitis and amelioration of colonic inflammation in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. The findings suggest that TS could be a potential natural medicine for the protection of UC health. The above results suggest that TS can be used as a potential therapeutic agent for the clinical regulation of UC.",

To investigate the effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and histological changes in NEC-induced newborn rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, NEC and NEC + EVOO. NEC induction was performed using hypoxia-hyperoxia, formula feeding, and cold stress. The NEC + EVOO group received 2 ml/kg EVOO with high phenolic content by gavage twice a day for 3 days. 3 cm of bowel including terminal ileum, cecum, and proximal colon was excised. RESULTS: Weight gain and clinical disease scores were significantly higher in the NEC + EVOO group than in the NEC group (p < 0.001). EVOO treatment caused significant decreases in IL1β, IL6 levels (p = 0.016, p = 0.029 respectively) and EGF, MDA levels (p = 0.032, p = 0.013 respectively) compared to NEC group. Significant decreases were observed in IL6 gene expression in the NEC + EVOO group compared to the NEC group (p = 0.002). In the group NEC + EVOO, the number of Caspase-3 positive cells was found to be significantly reduced (p < 0.001) and histopathological examination revealed minimal changes and significantly lower histopathological scores (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Phenol-rich EVOO prevents intestinal damage caused by NEC by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "The olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae Rossi) is the most dangerous pest of olive fruits and negatively influences the chemical and sensory quality of the oil produced. Organic farms have few tools against this pest and are constantly looking for effective and sustainable products such as geomaterials, i.e., zeolite. Since a particle film covers the canopy, a study was carried out on the olive tree's responses to zeolite foliar coating. The tested treatments were natural zeolite (NZ), zeolite enriched with ammonium (EZ), and Spintor-Fly® (SF). EZ was associated with higher photosynthetic activity with respect to the other treatments, while no differences were found between SF and NZ. Foliar treatments affect the amount of BVOC produced in both leaves and olives, where 26 and 23 different BVOCs (biogenic volatile organic compounds) were identified but not the type of compounds emitted. Foliar treatment with EZ significantly affected fruit size, and the olive fruit fly more frequently attacked the olives, while treatment with NZ had olives with similar size and attack as those treated with Spintor-Fly®; no difference in oil quantity was detected. Oil produced from olives treated with NZ presented higher values of phenolic content and intensities of bitterness and spiciness than oils from those treated with EZ and SF. According to the results of this study, using zeolite films on an olive tree canopy does not negatively influence plant physiology; it has an impact on BVOC emission and the chemical and sensory characteristics of the oil."

Still, there is no conclusive evidence correlating olive oil consumption to CVD. The aim of this study is to assess the global research, current research trends, and knowledge mapping related to the correlation between the consumption of olive oil and CVD using bibliometric analysis. On August 19, 2023, a title-specific literature search was conducted on the Scopus database using the search terms \"olive oil\" and \"cardiovascular disease\" with a date range of the past 50 years. Subsequently, bibliometric tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix were employed to analyze and evaluate the obtained documents. The search yielded (n = 429) publications and showed an upward trend in the annual publication count over the last five decades. The publication number exhibited a gradual increase with a rate of 5.55%. The results also indicated that 2530 authors, 759 institutions, 47 countries, and 223 journals have publications in this research domain. The present bibliometric study will be a valuable research reference for describing the worldwide research patterns concerning the relationship between olive oil and CVD during the past 50 years. In the future, the application of olive oil for the treatment of CVDs may be an emerging research trend. Apart from this, collaborations among authors, countries, and organizations are expected."

These NEs, produced with heating, contain olive oil (5%) and the surfactants tween 80 (5%) and span 80 (2.5%), water q.s. 100 mL, and were stable for 120 days. NE-2-CUR presented Ø of 165.40 ± 2.56 nm, PDI of 0.254, ζ of - 33.20 ± 1.35 mV, pH of 6.49, and Entrapment Drug Efficiency (EE) of 99%. The NE-4-CUR showed a Ø of 105.70 ± 4.13 nm, PDI of 0.459, ζ of - 32.10 ± 1.45 mV, pH of 6.40 and EE of 99.29%. Structural characterization was performed using DRX and FTIR, thermal characterization using DSC and TG, and morphological characterization using SEM, suggesting that there is no significant change in the CUR present in the NEs and that they remain stable. The MIC was performed by the broth microdilution method for nine gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates resistant to antibiotics and biofilm and efflux pump producers. The NEs mostly showed a bacteriostatic profile. The MIC varied between 125 and 250 µg/mL. The most sensitive bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, for which NE-2-CUR showed a MIC of 125 µg/mL. The NEs and ceftazidime (CAZ) interaction was also evaluated against the K. pneumoniae resistant clinical isolates using the Checkerboard method. NE-2-CUR and NE-4-CUR showed a synergistic or additive profile; there was a reduction in CAZ MICs between 256 times (K26-A2) and 2 times (K29-A2). Furthermore, the NEs inhibited these isolates biofilms formation. The NEs showed a MBIC ranging from 15.625 to 250 µg/mL. Thus, the NEs showed physicochemical characteristics suitable for future clinical trials, enhancing the CAZ antibacterial and antibiofilm activity, thus becoming a promising strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.

However, there is little evidence on the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. The aim was to analyse the effect of hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and oleocanthal on fibroblast gene expression. PCR was used to determine the expression of different differentiation markers, extracellular matrix elements, and growth factors in cultured human fibroblasts CCD-1064Sk treated with different doses of hydroxytyrosol (10-5 M and 10-6 M), tyrosol (10-5 M and 10-6 M), and oleocanthal (10-6 M and 10-7 M). After 24 h of hydroxytyrosol treatment, increased expression of connective tissue growth factor, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and their receptors was observed. Tyrosol and olecanthal modulated the expression of FGF and TGFβR1. All phytochemicals tested modified the expression of differentiation markers and extracellular matrix elements, increasing gene expression of actin, fibronectin, decorin, collagen I, and III. Phenolic compounds present in extra virgin olive could have a beneficial effect on tissue regeneration by modulating fibroblast physiology.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dietary fats with an abundance of phytonutrients have garnered public attention beyond fatty acids per se. This study was set to investigate the impact of consuming diets with red palm olein (RPOO), extra virgin coconut oil (EVCO) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO, as a control) on cardiometabolic risk biomarkers and lipid profile. METHODS: We recruited a total of 156 individuals with central obesity, aged 25-45 years, with waist circumference ≥ 90 cm for men and ≥ 80 cm for women in a parallel single-blind 3-arm randomised controlled trial. The participants consumed isocaloric diets (~ 2400 kcal) enriched with respective test fats (RPOO, EVCO or EVOO) for a 12-week duration. RESULTS: The mean of the primary outcome plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein was statistically similar between the three diets after a 12-week intervention. EVOO resulted in significantly lower mean LDL cholesterol compared with RPOO and EVCO, despite similar effects on LDL and HDL cholesterol subfractions. The RPOO diet group showed elevated mean α and β -carotenes levels compared with EVCO and EVOO diet groups (P < 0.05), corresponding with the rich carotenoid content in RPOO. CONCLUSION: The three oils, each of which has unique phytonutrient and fatty acid compositions, manifested statistically similar cardiometabolic effects in individuals with central obesity at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases with distinct circulating antioxidant properties.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by several pathological hallmarks, including the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Current treatment options include monoclonal antibody drugs, acetylcholinesterase, and n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists. Although those treatments provide some improvements in patients' quality of life, they fail to prevent or cure AD. Current research aims to identify novel targets and tools for AD prevention and modification. In this context, several studies showed the beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet in the prevention and treatment of AD. One integral component of the Mediterranean diet is olive oil and extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), which is high in phenolic compounds. EVOO and other olive-related phenolic compounds have been shown to reduce the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which EVOO and phenolic compounds exert neuroprotective effects, including modulation of AD pathologies and promotion of cognitive health. Findings indicate that EVOO and its phenolic constituents influence key pathological processes of AD, such as Aβ aggregation, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, while also enhancing BBB integrity and reducing oxidative stress. The human studies cited reveal a consistent trend where the consumption of olive oil is associated with cognitive benefits and a decreased risk of AD and related dementias. In conclusion, EVOO and its phenolic compounds hold promising potential for the prevention and treatment of AD, representing a significant shift towards more effective strategies against this complex neurodegenerative disorder.",

      "abstract": "Chronic inflammation and insulin resistance lead to metabolic syndrome and there is an urgent need to establish effective treatments and prevention methods. Our previous study reported that obese model Zucker (fa/fa) rats fed with ozonated olive oil alleviated fatty liver and liver damage by suppressing inflammatory factors. However, differences among animal species related to the safety and efficacy of ozonated olive oil administration remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of oral intake of ozonated olive oil on lipid metabolism in normal mice and mice in the obesity model. C57BL/6J and db/db mice were fed the following AIN-76 diets for four weeks: the mice were either fed a 0.5% olive oil diet (Control diet) or 0.5% ozonated olive oil diet (Oz-Olive diet) in addition to 6.5% corn oil. The results indicated that four weeks of Oz-Olive intake did not adversely affect growth parameters, hepatic lipids or serum parameters in normal C57BL/6J mice. Subsequent treatment of db/db mice with Oz-Olive for four weeks reduced the levels of hepatic triglycerides, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum insulin. These effects of Oz-Olive administration might be due to suppression of fatty acid synthesis activity and expression of lipogenic genes, as well as suppression of inflammatory gene expression. In conclusion, this study confirmed the safety of Oz-Olive administration in normal mice and its ability to alleviate hepatic steatosis by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and inflammation in obese mice.",

This study aimed to determine the feasibility of daily intake of EVOO and its potential to alleviate facial pain of TN. Adults, self-reporting as female and affected by TN, were enrolled in a 16-week nonblinded, parallel study. After a 4-week baseline, participants were randomized to 60 mL/day EVOO or control (usual diet and no supplemental EVOO) for 12 weeks. Participants completed a daily questionnaire on pain intensity and compliance, the Penn Facial Pain Scale weekly, the 36-Item Short Form Survey monthly, and dietary assessment during baseline and intervention. Participants (n = 52; 53.3 ± 12.9 years) were recruited nationally; 42 completed the study. The EVOO group, with 90% intake compliance, showed significant decreases in the Penn Facial Pain Scale items of interference with general function, interference with orofacial function, and severity of pain from baseline, whereas the control group showed no improvements. EVOO benefit, compared with control, trended for the interference with orofacial function (P = .05). The 36-Item Short Form Survey items of role limitations resulting from emotional problems and role limitations from physical health favored EVOO. The EVOO group significantly improved their Healthy Eating Index 2015 component scores of fatty acids (primarily from increased oleic acid), sodium, and refined grains. EVOO intake of 60 mL/day was feasible for participants experiencing TN and may mitigate pain and improve quality of life. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05032573).",

It is unknown how ANGPTLs respond to cottonseed oil (CSO) and olive oil (OO) consumption in a population with hypercholesterolemia. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of CSO vs. OO consumption on fasting and postprandial ANGPTL responses in adults with hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesized that CSO would have lower fasting and postprandial ANGPTL responses compared with OO. Forty-two adults with high cholesterol completed a single-blind, randomized trial comparing CSO (n = 21) vs. OO (n = 21) diet enrichment. An 8-week partial outpatient feeding intervention provided ∼60% of the volunteers' total energy expenditure (∼30% of total energy expenditure as CSO or OO). The remaining 40% was not controlled. Fasting blood draws were taken at pre-, mid-, and postintervention visits. Volunteers consumed a high saturated fat meal followed by 5 hours of blood draws pre- and postvisits. Fasting ANGPTL3 had a marginally significant treatment by visit interaction (P = .06) showing an increase from pre- to postintervention in CSO vs. OO (CSO: 385.1 ± 27.7 to 440.3 ± 33.9 ng/mL; OO: 468.2 ± 38.3 to 449.2 ± 49.5 ng/mL). Both postprandial ANGPTL3 (P = .02) and ANGPTL4 (P < .01) had treatment by visit interactions suggesting increases from pre- to postintervention in OO vs. CSO with no differences between groups in ANGPTL8. These data show a worsening (increase) of postprandial ANGPTLs after the OO, but not CSO, intervention. This aligns with previously reported data in which postprandial triglycerides were protected from increases compared with OO. ANGPTLs may mediate protective effects of CSO consumption on lipid control. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04397055).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hand Foot Syndrome (HFS) is a frequent adverse effect observed in patients undergoing capecitabine chemotherapy, often leading to treatment disruptions and dose adjustments. Elevated C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) levels have been associated with the development of HFS. This study aimed to assess the potential of unrefined Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) supplementation in mitigating HFS and hs-CRP elevation among individuals receiving capecitabine chemotherapy. METHODS: Between November 2022 and May 2023, forty-five eligible participants were enrolled in this randomized trial. Patients with advanced colorectal or breast cancer were randomly allocated into three groups: an intervention group receiving unrefined EVOO supplementation (30 mL per day) alongside capecitabine, a placebo group receiving refined extra light olive oil (ELOO) supplementation (30 mL per day) alongside capecitabine, and a control group receiving capecitabine alone. The masking of both placebo and intervention groups was ensured through identical packaging and instructions, maintaining participant and physician blindness to the assigned treatments. Randomization, achieved via computer-generated sequences, ensured even distribution among the three groups. RESULTS: HFS incidences were notably lower in the EVOO group (13.3%) compared to the placebo (66.7%) and control (80%) groups. Instances of Grade 2 or more severe HFS were observed in 20% of placebo and 40% of control group patients. No cases of severe HFS were reported in the EVOO group. Moreover, EVOO supplementation led to a significant reduction in hs-CRP levels when contrasted with the placebo and control groups. These findings suggest that EVOO may serve as a preventive measure against HFS and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in patients undergoing capecitabine chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential benefits of incorporating unrefined EVOO into the regimen of patients undergoing capecitabine chemotherapy. EVOO supplementation was associated with lower incidences of HFS and a reduction in hs-CRP levels, indicating its possible role in preventing HFS development and mitigating inflammation.",

Cottonseed oil (CSO), which is rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fats, has been shown to lower cholesterol and other chronic disease risk factors. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to determine the comparative responses of markers of inflammation and coagulation potential of healthy adult males consuming diets rich in CSO vs. olive oil (OO). METHODS: Fifteen normal-weight males, ages 21.7 ± 2.58y, completed a randomized crossover trial. Each intervention consisted of a 3-day lead-in diet and a 5-day outpatient, controlled feeding intervention (CSO or OO). There was a 2 to 4-week washout period between interventions. The 5-day intervention diets were 35 % carbohydrate, 15 % protein, and 50 % fat, enriched with either CSO or OO (44 % of total energy from oil). At pre- and post- diet intervention visits, a fasting blood draw was collected for analysis of markers of inflammation (Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP)) and coagulation potential (Tissue Factor (TF), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)). RESULTS: The CSO-enriched diets reduced TNF-α (CSO: -0.12 ± 0.02 pg/ml, OO: -0.01 ± 0.05 pg/ml; p < 0.01) and TF (CSO: -0.59 ± 0.68 pg/ml, OO: 1.13 ± 0.83 pg/ml; p = 0.02) compared to OO diets. There were no differences in IL-6, CRP, or PAI-1 between diets. CONCLUSION: A 5-day, CSO-enriched diet may be sufficient to reduce inflammation and coagulation potential compared to OO-enriched diets in a healthy male population which could have implications in chronic disease prevention.",

Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the preventive role of the effects of an OLA-supplemented diet in the murine model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), delving into the possible mechanisms and signaling pathways involved. Animals were fed an OLA-enriched preventive diet for 6 weeks prior to CIA induction and until the end of the experimental time course. On day 43 after the first immunization, mice were sacrificed: blood was collected, and paws were histologically and biochemically processed. Dietary OLA prevented collagen-induced rheumatic bone, joint and cartilage conditions. Circulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17) levels were significantly decreased in the joint, as well as MMP-9 and cathepsin-K (CatK) expression in secoiridoid-fed animals. In addition, dietary OLA was able to decrease COX-2, mPGES-1 and iNOS protein expressions and, also, PGE2 levels. The mechanisms possibly involved in these protective effects could be related to the activation of the Nrf-2/HO-1 axis and the inhibition of proinflammatory signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, MAPKs and NF-κB, involved in the production of inflammatory and oxidative mediators. These results support the interest of OLA, as a nutraceutical intervention, in the management of RA.",

The present study was designed to evaluate whether pretreatment of olive oil and leaf extract can attenuate the most important destructive processes in cerebral ischemia called excitotoxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The male rats were categorized into control, virgin olive oil (OVV), MCAO, MCAO + OVV (with doses of 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 ml/kg as treatment groups), olive leaf extract, MCAO + olive leaf extract (with doses 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg as treatment groups) groups. Rats of treatment groups received gastric gavage with olive oil or leaf extract for 30 consecutive days. After pretreatment, the intraluminal filament technique was used to block middle cerebral artery (MCA) transiently. Neurological deficits, infarct volume and expression of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3) proteins were measured. RESULTS: The results revealed that olive oil at doses of 0.50 and 0.75 ml/kg reduced the infarction and neurological score and upregulated NCXs expression in rat brain. In addition, olive leaf extract at doses of 75 and 100 mg/kg attenuated the infarction and neurological score and enhanced NCXs expression in rat brain. CONCLUSION: These findings support the view that olive oil and leaf extract play the neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia due to the upregulation of NCXs protein expression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet is linked to various health benefits, especially the consumption of olive oil as a key component. Multiple studies highlight its advantages, particularly due to its fatty acid composition and additional components like phenolic compounds. A significant antioxidant compound, oleocanthal, known for its antioxidant properties, has gained attention in the pharmaceutical industry for its anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects. It shows promise in addressing cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and neuroprotection. This systematic review aims to evaluate the existing literature on oleocanthal, examining its role in biological processes and potential impact on conditions like inflammation and cancer. METHODS: We performed several searches in PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science (WOS), and Cochrane based on the terms \"Oleocanthal\", \"Cancer\", and \"Inflammation\". The inclusion criteria were as follows: studies whose main topics were oleocanthal and cancer or inflammation. On the other hand, the exclusion criteria were studies that were not focused on oleocanthal, reviews, or editorial material. Given that these findings are explanatory rather than derived from clinical trials, we refrained from employing methods to assess potential bias. This systematic review did not receive any external funding. RESULTS: We found 174 records from these searches, where we discarded reviews and editorial material, duplicated articles, and 1 retracted article. Finally, we had 53 reports assessed for eligibility that were included in this review. DISCUSSION: OC exhibits promising therapeutic potential against both inflammation and cancer. We addressed its ability to target inflammatory genes and pathways, offering potential treatments for conditions like rheumatic diseases by regulating pathways such as NF-kB and MAPK. Additionally, OC's anticancer properties, particularly its notable inhibition of c-Met signaling across various cancers, highlight its efficacy, showcasing promise as a potential treatment."

      "abstract": "Tamoxifen (TAM) is an antiestrogenic agent used for adjuvant treatment in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in the pre/post-menopausal period. This study, it was aimed to determine the effect of olive oil extract of propolis (OEP) on short and long-term administration of TAM in rats. Wistar albino rats were divided into groups with eight animals in each. Groups: control, OEP, TAM, and OEP + TAM. At the end of the experiment, oxidative stress tests were performed with Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) on blood and tissue samples (liver, kidney, and ovary) taken from rats. After single-dose TAM administration, there was a significant increase in red blood cell, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration levels compared to the control group, a decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) value, a significant increase in liver enzymes and fasting glucose values was detected compared with the control and propolis groups. A normalizing effect was observed in the group given OEP and TAM combined. The increase in Malondialdehyde (MDA) and the decrease in enzyme activities in tissues are also noteworthy. Propolis application reduced the tissue damage caused by TAM. In addition, improved cytokine levels, which increased with TAM administration. It has been concluded that OEP can be given in supportive treatment, as it improves hematological and antioxidant parameters in TAM treatment.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a known risk factor for breast cancer, the most common malignancy among women worldwide. We have previously described different effects of high-fat diets on mammary experimental carcinogenesis. In this work, we analyzed the animal growth data obtained in six experimental assays, in healthy and carcinogen-induced rats undergoing different dietary interventions. The animals were fed with three experimental diets administered at different periods of development: a control low-fat diet, and two isocaloric high-fat diets (rich in corn oil or in extravirgin olive oil -EVOO-). Weekly weight throughout the development of 818 animals have been compiled and reanalyzed using adjusted mathematical models. Molecular mechanisms have been investigated: ethanolamides in small intestine, neuropeptides controlling satiety in hypothalamus, and proteins controlling lipid metabolism in adipose and mammary tissues. The results indicated that the effect of diets depended on type of lipid, timing of intervention and health status. The high corn oil diet, but not the high EVOO diet, increased body weight and mass, especially if administered from weaning, in healthy animals and in those that received a moderate dose of carcinogen. The potential protective effect of EVOO on weight maintenance may be related to anorexigenic neuropeptides such as oxytocin and lipolysis/deposition balance in adipose tissue (increasing phospho-PKA, HSL, MGL and decreasing FAS). In animals with cancer, body weight gain was related to the severity of the disease. Taken together, our results suggest that EVOO has a beneficial effect on body weight maintenance in both health and cancer.",

In this study, we examined the short-term effects of olive oil extract (OE) enriched with HT on left atrial function, left ventricular (LV) function, and arterial elastic properties in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD). Sixty-one patients with chronic CAD were enrolled. This randomized study had a two-period, two-sequence crossover (AB/BA) design. Group AB (n = 32) initially received OE capsules (500 mg) enriched with HT (5 mg) (two capsules/day) for 30 days, and after a wash out of 48 h, placebo for another 30 days. The opposite occurred in Group BA (n = 29). Exclusion criteria included age >70 years, diabetes, anemia, hypertension, liver and thyroid disease, malignancy, autoimmune disease, kidney disease, use of corticosteroids, weight loss, excessive exercise dietary intervention, and use of antioxidant vitamins. Patients underwent echocardiography/Doppler and applanation tonometry applied to radial artery at the beginning and end of the study. No significant change regarding Vmax, Vp, Vmin, E wave, A wave, deceleration time, LV ejection fraction, central aortic systolic and pulse pressure, and augmentation index. However, a trend toward improvement of E/e' (P = .062) and pulse wave velocity (P = .091) was observed. Use of OE enriched with HT for a limited time period was associated with a trend toward improvement of LV diastolic function and aortic elastic properties in chronic CAD patients. Studies of longer duration are needed to delineate the effect of this promising agent on cardiovascular function and outcomes in chronic CAD.",

      "abstract": "Since antiquity, numerous advantages of olive oil and its by-products have been recognized in various domains, including cooking, skincare, and healthcare. Extra virgin olive oil is a crucial component of the Mediterranean diet; several of its compounds exert antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic effects against a variety of cancers, and also affect cellular metabolism, targeting cancer cells through their metabolic derangements. Numerous olive tree parts, including leaves, can contribute metabolites useful to human health. Olive mill waste water (OMWW), a dark and pungent liquid residue produced in vast amounts during olive oil extraction, contains high organic matter concentrations that may seriously contaminate the soil and surrounding waters if not managed properly. However, OMWW is a rich source of phytochemicals with various health benefits. In ancient Rome, the farmers would employ what was known as amurca, a mulch-like by-product of olive oil production, for many purposes and applications. Several studies have investigated anti-angiogenic and chemopreventive activities of OMWW extracts. The most prevalent polyphenol in OMWW extracts is hydroxytyrosol (HT). Verbascoside and oleuperin are also abundant. We assessed the impact of one such extract, A009, on endothelial cells (HUVEC) and cancer cells. A009 was anti-angiogenic in several in vitro assays (growth, migration, adhesion) and inhibited angiogenesis in vivo, outperforming HT alone. A009 inhibited cells from several tumors in vitro and in vivo and showed potential cardioprotective effects mitigating cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy drugs, commonly used in cancer treatment, and reducing up-regulation of pro-inflammatory markers in cardiomyocytes. Extracts from OMWW and other olive by-products have been evaluated for biological activities by various international research teams. The results obtained make them promising candidates for further development as nutraceutical and cosmeceutical agents or dietary supplement, especially in cancer prevention or even in co-treatments with anti-cancer drugs. Furthermore, their potential to offer cardioprotective benefits opens up avenues for application in the field of cardio-oncology."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Waning immunity after vaccination justifies the need for additional effective COVID-19 treatments. Immunomodulation of local immune response at the oropharyngeal mucosa could hypothetically activate mucosal immunity, which can prevent SARS-CoV-2 main immune evasion mechanisms in early stages of the disease and send an effective warning to other components of immune system. Olive polyphenols are biologically active compounds with immunomodulatory activity. There are previous studies based on immunomodulation with olive polyphenols and respiratory infections using an enteral route, which point to potential effects on time to resolution of symptoms. The investigators sought to determine whether participants following immunomodulation with tiny quantities of high polyphenolic olive oil administered through an oromucosal route could have a better outcome in COVID-19. SUMMARY: This pilot clinical trial investigated the effect of buccopharyngeal administered high polyphenolic olive oil on COVID-19 incidence, duration, and severity. IMPORTANCE: Waning immunity after vaccination justifies the need of further research for additional effective treatments for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Immunomodulation of local immune response at the buccopharyngeal mucosa could hypothetically activate mucosal immunity, which would in turn difficult SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion mechanisms in early stages of the disease and send an effective warning to other components of immune system. Olive polyphenols are biologically active compounds with immunomodulatory activity. There are previous studies based on immunomodulation with olive polyphenols and respiratory infections, using an enteral route, which suggest potential shortening of time to resolution of symptoms. The investigators sought to determine whether participants following immunomodulation with tiny quantities of high polyphenolic olive oil administered through an oromucosal route could have a better outcome in COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double blind, randomized pilot clinical trial conducted at a single site, Talavera de la Reina, Spain. Potential study participants were identified by simple random sampling from the epidemiological database of contact patients recently diagnosed of COVID-19 during the study period. A total of 88 adult participants were enrolled and 84 completed the 3-month study, conducted between July 1, 2021 and August 31, 2022. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to receive oromucosal administered high polyphenolic olive oil, 2 mL twice a day for 3 months or no treatment. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were incidence, duration, and severity of COVID-19 after intervention. RESULTS: There were no differences in incidence between both groups but there were significant differences in duration, the median time to resolution of symptoms was 3 days in the high polyphenolic olive oil group compared with 7 days in the no-treatment group. Although time to resolution is directly related to severity, this study did not find any differences in severity. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among full-vaccinated adults recent infected with COVID-19, a daily intake of tiny quantities of oromucosal administered high polyphenolic olive oil before infection significantly improved the time to symptom resolution. This finding strongly support the appropriateness of further deep research on the use of oromucosal administered high polyphenolic olive oil as an effective immune strategy against COVID-19.",

Olive oil industrial wastewater (OOIWW) consists of highly toxic environmental pollutants with high salinity. Saline olive oil industrial wastewater was treated using halophilic consortium in UMFC (upflow microbial fuel cell) mobilized with carbon felt as electrode. Total and soluble COD (chemical oxygen demand), total suspended solids and phenol content removal were studied at different organic loads (0.56, 0.77, 1.05, 1.26, 1.52 and 1.8 gCOD/L). UMFC with OOIWW was optimized at 1.52 gCOD/L for high organic removal and corresponding electricity production. Total COD, soluble COD, TSS and phenol removal were 91%, 89%, 78%, and complete removal of phenol was accomplished at the optimized organic load (1.52 gCOD/L). Correspondingly, the maximum bioenergy yield was 784 mV with 439 mW/m2 (power density) and 560 mA/m2 (current density), respectively. The presence of prominent halophilic exo-electrogens such as Ochrobactrum, Marinobacter, Rhodococcus and Bacillus potently treated the OOIWW and exhibited high energy yield."

An isocaloric olive oil HFD (HFD-O) reduced body weight gain compared to the HFD-L, in a manner reversed by PPARα antagonism, and enhanced brain and intestinal OlGly levels and gut microbial diversity. OlGly or OlAla treatment of HFD-L mice resulted in gut microbiota taxonomic changes partly similar to those induced by HFD-O. We suggest that OlGly and OlAla control body weight by counteracting highly palatable food overconsumption, and possibly rebalancing the gut microbiota, and provide a potential new mechanism of action for the obeso-preventive effects of olive oil-rich diets.",

One of the main actors of this inflammation is monocytes, with the switch in their phenotypes and irregularities in their cytokine production. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to investigate the nutraceutical potential of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on the inflammatory status of monocytes in participants showing different levels of cardiovascular risk. METHODS: 43 participants 65-85 years old were recruited including 14 healthy, 12 dyslipidemic patients with hypercholesterolemia recently diagnosed, and 17 post-infarct patients. Participants from all groups were supplemented with EVOO (25 mL/day) for 6 months. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α cytokine production, and monocyte phenotypes were investigated both at quiescent and at stimulated state by flow cytometry. RESULTS: At the baseline (pre-intervention), dyslipidemic patients, compared to healthy and post-infarct participants, showed monocytes in an inflammatory state characterized by a significantly weaker IL-10 production. Our results do not show a significant modulation of the phenotype or IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-α production following a 6-month EVOO intake whether at quiescence or under stimulation. However, IL-1β is significantly increased by the intervention of EVOO in post-infarct patients. Paradoxically after the 6-month intervention, monocytes from dyslipidemic patients showed a significantly decreased secretion of IL-1β under LPS stimulation despite the increase observed at basal state. CONCLUSION: Our results show that 6-month EVOO intervention did not induce a monocyte phenotypic change or that this intervention significantly modifies cytokine production.",

      "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite used to treat inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders and some malignancies. However, it has some life-threatening side effects such as nephrotoxicity which limit its clinical applications. That motivated the attention to seek for a defensive material to improve the outcomes of methotrexate while minimizing both renal and non-renal toxicity. Both honey (H) and olive oil (OO) are bioactive substances widely used as nutraceuticals that exhibited a potent therapeutic and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to assess the possible protective effect of H and OO intake either singly or together against the biochemical and structural Methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. The study was conducted on 56 adult albino rats, they were divided into seven groups (n = 8): group 1 received only distelled water (negative control), group 2 received H (1.2 g/kg/day), group 3 received OO (1.25 ml/kg/day), group 4 received a single intraperitoneal injection of MTX (20 mg/kg), group 5 received MTX and H, group 6 received MTX and OO, group 7 received MTX, H and OO together. At the end of the experiment (2 weeks), all rats were sacrificed, and blood samples were assessed for kidney function tests. Kidney tissues were evaluated for several antioxidant parameters including Malondialdehyde (MDA), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. Tissues were also processed for histological and immunohistochemical assessments. Results revealed that both H and OO improved the kidney function markers, histopathological and immunohistological changes due to Methotrexate-induced renal damage. Additionally, both substances also redeemed the oxidative damage of the kidney by decreasing MDA and increasing anti-oxidant enzymatic activities. Such effects were more apparent when the two substances were given together. Ultimately, our results proof that H and OO amiolerate the Methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, thus they can be used as an adjuvant supplements for patients requiring methotrexate therapy."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of extra virgin olive (EVO) oil and fruity oil for the treatment of gingivitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 75 patients over 18 years of age with gingivitis induced by plaque bacteria was divided into three groups: study group A, with extra virgin olive oil; study group B, with fruity oil; and control group C. In the two study groups, EVO oil was administered as a mouthwash to patients with gingival inflammation. The protocol included a daily application of the product for 30 days, with three recalls 15 days apart. Clinical parameters of plaque formation and gingivitis, including plaque index (PI) and bleeding index (BI), were assessed at each recall and scored on a specific periodontal chart. The control group received no mouthwash treatment in addition to normal daily oral hygiene procedures, and the same clinical parameters as the study group were evaluated. Data were evaluated using SPSS 27.0 software for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Then, the pre- and post-treatment values of the groups were compared using Student's t-test, setting p < 0.05 as the significance level. RESULTS: Comparison of the three groups showed that extra-virgin olive oil was an adjuvant in the treatment of gingival inflammation, improving PI and BI. In group A, the mean plaque index showed a 48% reduction, and the bleeding index showed a 64% reduction after 30 days. In group B, the mean plaque index showed a 35% reduction and a bleeding index reduction of 43% after 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The collected data showed significant improvements in the formation of bacterial plaque and gingivitis. The exact mechanism of such treatment is still to be elucidated. As a result of this, further studies with a different sample of patients than those used and a comparison with other products need to be addressed to verify and demonstrate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of the components of this natural product."

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is studied mostly for its health benefits in preventing non-communicable chronic diseases, particularly within a Mediterranean dietary pattern. However, few studies have addressed the effect of EVOO in healthy individuals, prior to an established disease. This study aims to evaluate the impact of Northern Portuguese polyphenol-rich EVOO (NPPR-EVOO) consumption on various important clinical parameters in healthy adult volunteers. (2) Methods: This quasi-experimental intervention study assessed the impact of NPPR-EVOO for a period of 100 days. Serum total cholesterol, HbA1c, HDL-c, LDL-c, and CRP, and anthropometric measures-waist and hip perimeters, hand grip strength, and body fat-were assessed and food logs were analyzed. (3) Results: Serum HbA1c (5.12 ± 0.32%; 4.93 ± 0.24, p = 0.000) and LDL-c (96.50 ± 28.57 mg/dL; 87.41 ± 31.38 mg/dL, p = 0.017) significantly decreased following NPPR-EVOO. Also, daily energy significantly increased, but no changes in other dietary parameters, or anthropometry, were seen. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet did not explain the differences found in individuals regarding serum lipid profile and HbA1c, reinforcing the role of EVOO's effect. (4) Conclusions: NPPR-EVOO lowered the serum levels of LDL cholesterol and HbA1c, providing clues on the effect of EVOO-putative health benefits. These results pave the way for a deeper exploration of EVOO as a functional food.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the inhibitory effect of OZO against the growth and spore germination of the Alternaria alternata fungal strain. Additionally, evaluation of the synthesis inhibition of Alternaria toxins (ATs), among which are alternariol (AOH), alternariol-9-methyl ether (AME), and tenuazonic acid (TeA) in the potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium and orange fruit after harvest. The results indicated that the inhibition zone was 29.0 ± 1.2 mm at 20 mg/L of OZO. The MIC and MFC values were recorded at 0.186 and 1.57 mg/mL, respectively. In this regard, OZO prevented conidia germination at 98.8% with the treatment of 5 mg/mL. OZO at 20 mg/mL was efficacious in producing a high loss in ATs production in the PDB medium, reaching 73.4, 76, and 67.1% for AOH, AME, and TeA, respectively. In addition, OZO prevents the biosynthesis of AOH and AME during the storage of orange fruits compared with the positive control sample. In contrast, 20 mg/mL reduced TeA accumulation and the appearance of Alternaria brown spot (ABS) in orange. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that studies OZO to control ATs in vitro in orange fruits."

We report a pilot randomised controlled trial of an intervention supplementing extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on markers of cardiovascular risk among East Asian Chinese, and European Caucasian individuals. Methods: A cross-over, randomised controlled dietary intervention for 2 weeks was undertaken. Thirty-two adults, healthy, individuals of Chinese and European origin took part in this study. 24-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), and blood lipids, were assessed. Results: Positive benefits of EVOO consumption were observed in all participants. Lower 24-h ambulatory SBP (-4.3 mmHg; p = 0.020), and day-time SBP (5.528 mmHg; p = 0.008), night-time DBP (-3.784 mmHg; p = 0.008) and night-time MAP (-3.747 mmHg; p = 0.007) were seen in all participants independently of covariates. In addition, total cholesterol (7.9 mg/dL; p = 0.017) and LDL-cholesterol (6.5 mg/dL; p = 0.028) were increased with butter but not with olive oil. No significant difference in other cardiovascular risk factors were observed. However, differences were observed between Caucasians and East Asian individuals in the absence of significant differences in lifestyle. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that consumption of EVOO should be advocated as a healthier dietary fat and recommended to replace butter as a dietary strategy to improve cardiovascular health in both Caucasians and East Asian individuals."

This cell population can be stimulated by some bioactive compounds such as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) polyphenols. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of hydroxytyrosol (htyr), tyrosol (tyr), and oleocanthal (ole) phenolic compounds present in EVOO on the proliferation, migration, cell cycle, and antigenic profile of cultured human fibroblasts. CCD-1064Sk human fibroblast cells were treated for 24 h with each polyphenol at doses ranging 10-5 to 10-9 M. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the MTT spectrophotometric technique, migration capacity by culture insert assay, and cell cycle and antigenic profile with flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was significantly increased by treatment with all compounds. The highest increases followed treatments with htyr or tyr at doses of 10-5 or 10-6 M and with ole at 10-6 and 10-7 M, and these compounds and doses were used for assays of antigenic profile, cell cycle, and migration. During the first few hours after treatment, increased fibronectin and α-actin expressions and greater cell migration were observed, with no cell cycle changes. In conclusion, these in vitro results suggest that phenolic compounds in EVOO might contribute to wound healing through action on fibroblasts related to tissue regeneration.",

The main evidence, however, is provided by experimental studies. Few human studies have examined the health benefits of olive oils rich in these biophenols. Our aim was to assess the health properties of rich oleocanthal and oleacein extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), compared to those of common olive oil (OO), in people with prediabetes and obesity. METHODS: Randomised, double-blind, crossover trial done in people aged 40-65 years with obesity (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) and prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%). The intervention consisted in substituting for 1 month the oil used for food, both raw and cooked, by EVOO or OO. No changes in diet or physical activity were recommended. The primary outcome was the inflammatory status. Secondary outcomes were the oxidative status, body weight, glucose handling and lipid profile. An ANCOVA model adjusted for age, sex and treatment administration sequence was used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were enrolled (33 men and 58 women) and finished the trial. A decrease in interferon-γ was observed after EVOO treatment, reaching inter-treatment differences (P = 0.041). Total antioxidant status increased and lipid and organic peroxides decreased after EVOO treatment, the changes reaching significance compared to OO treatment (P < 0.05). Decreases in weight, BMI and blood glucose (p < 0.05) were found after treatment with EVOO and not with OO. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with EVOO rich in oleocanthal and oleacein differentially improved oxidative and inflammatory status in people with obesity and prediabetes.",

In fact, the trend is to use increasingly greener olives to improve quality by decreasing the extraction yield, thus obtaining a higher content of antioxidant phenolics. The application of a cold-pressing system to the olive before the extraction of oil was tested with three varieties: picual at three different stages of maturity and arbequina and hojiblanca at early stages of maturity. The Abencor system was used for the extraction of virgin olive oil and its by-products. For the quantification of phenols and total sugars for all phases, organic solvent extractions and colorimetric measurements and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a UV detector were used. The results show that the new treatment significantly improved the amount of oil extracted by between 1 and 2% and even increased its concentration of total phenols by up to 33%. Regarding the by-products, the concentrations of the main phenols, such as hydroxytyrosol, increased by almost 50%, as did the glycoside. The treatment also facilitated the separation of phases in by-products and improved the phenolic profile, although not in terms of total phenols, but individual phenols with higher antioxidant activity were obtained."

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of olive oil and flaxseed consumption as part of a healthy diet on endothelial function, plasma inflammatory factors, and lipid profile in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHOD: This randomized nonblinded trial was performed on CHD patients. In the control group, participants received general heart-healthy dietary recommendations while in the intervention group, in addition to these recommendations, the participants consumed 25 ml of olive oil and 30 g of flaxseeds daily for 3 months. At baseline and after 3 months, changes in brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), plasma asymmetric dimethyl arginine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and lipids and lipoproteins were measured. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients finished the trial ( n  = 24 in the intervention and n  = 26 in the control groups). Compared to the control group, consumption of flaxseed and olive oil significantly improved brachial artery FMD%, and reduced plasma IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, total cholesterol, and tended to reduce hs-CRP, and non-HDL-cholesterol but the concentration of other study indices were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of olive oil and flaxseed in the diet of CHD patients may contribute to secondary prevention by improving endothelial function and plasma inflammatory factors.",

      "abstract": "Diet composition has a great impact on body composition. Several studies have suggested a beneficial effect of adding olive oil to a calorie-restricted diet as a weight loss strategy. However, there is no clear direction regarding the effect of olive oil on body fat distribution. This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to investigate the effect of olive oil consumption (for cooking or as a supplement) on body fat distribution in adults. The present study was conducted following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42021234652). All randomized clinical trials of parallel or crossover design found in PubMed (via MEDLINE), EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus databases that compared the effects of olive oil with other oils on body fat distribution in adults were included. 52 articles were included. The results indicate that the consumption of olive oil does not seem to alter the distribution of body fat, despite a small indication that supplementation in capsules can increase adipose mass (Mean Difference = 0.28 kg, 95% CI [-0.27, 0.83]; between-groups difference p = 0.59) and waist circumference (mean difference = 1.74 kg, 95% CI [0.86, 1.62]; between-groups difference p < 0.01) and decrease its auxiliary culinary use (mean difference = -0.32 kg, 95% CI [-0.90, 0.26]). Lean mass responds negatively to OO the higher the dose (slope = -0.61, 95% CI [-1.01, -0.21], p = 0.003) and time offered (slope = -0.8822, 95% CI [-1.44, -0.33], p = 0.002). In conclusion, this systematic review showed that OO ingestion in different delivery vehicles, dosages, and durations can interfere body composition. It is important to emphasize that some other aspects of the population and the intervention, that were not possible to be explored in the analysis, could confound the real effects of OO on body composition.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial, anti-adherent and erosion-protective properties of ellagic acid (EA) as a polyphenolic agent. The combination with olive oil was investigated additionally to verify a possible improved bioactive effect of EA. (2) An in situ study was carried out with six subjects. Individual splints were prepared with bovine enamel specimens. The splints were worn for 1 min (pellicle formation time). Thereafter, 10 min rinses were performed with EA in water/in oil. Bacterial adherence was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (DAPI, ConA, BacLight) after an 8 h oral exposition time. Additionally, the splints were worn for 30 min to quantify demineralization processes. The ultrastructure of the pellicle was investigated after an oral exposure time of 2 h under a transmission electron microscope. Statistical analysis was performed by Kruskal-Wallis tests, Mann-Whitney U tests and Bonferroni-Holm correction. (3) Rinsing with EA led to a significant reduction of adherent vital and dead bacteria. The combination with olive oil did not improve these outcomes. The assessment of glucan structures after rinsing with EA in water showed significant effects. Significant differences were observed for both rinses in calcium release at pH 3.0. After rinsing with EA in oil, significantly less calcium was released compared to rinsing with EA in water (pH = 3.0). (4) Olive oil is not suitable as a transport medium for lipophilic polyphenols. EA has anti-adherent and antibacterial properties in situ. EA also shows erosion-protective effects, which can be enhanced in combination with olive oil depending on the pH value. Ellagic acid has a neutral pH and could be an opportunity in the treatment of specific patient groups (xerostomia or mucositis).",

An optimization of the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) conditions, such as temperature, residence time, and water/solid ratio, was carried out to maximize the adsorption capacity. Eight HCs were obtained, and an in-depth comparative characterization, as well as adsorption tests of two pharmaceuticals with very different physicochemical properties (fluoxetine (FLX) and cefazolin (CFZ)), were performed. This first step allowed for elucidation of the best candidates to carry out nitrogen grafting on their surface, resulting in the HC obtained at a higher water/solid ratio and temperature, and longer residence time: 3-220°C-2.5 h with a maximum uptake of 4.6 and 0.4 mg/g for FLX and CFZ, respectively. After that, a facile one-step, one-pot synthesis of nitrogen-doped hydrochars (N-HC) was developed to prepare a versatile bio-adsorbent with enhanced adsorption capacity. Two N-HCs were prepared using urea (U-HC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI-HC) and were intensively characterized to shed light on the adsorption mechanism. In both cases, amide groups were formed, which favored the adsorption process. PEI-HC acquired an outstanding maximum adsorption capacity of 983.84 mg/g for CFZ, and 29.31 mg/g for FLX, and the process was well described by the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. A co-adsorption test was performed using PEI-HC for both pharmaceuticals, finding that the adsorption process occurs in different active sites because there was no interference between the pollutants. This fact corroborates the versatility of the new bio-adsorbent synthesized.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Infantile colic is one of the most common disorders in the first months of infants' lives. This condition hurts parents' moods. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of the topical use of olive oil on infantile colic symptoms. METHODS: The study was carried out on 80 infants 1-3 months old, randomly allocated into two groups, receiving abdominal massage with olive oil thrice a day in the intervention group (n = 40) and the same procedure with liquid paraffin in the placebo group (n = 40), for 14 successive days. During this period, the parents recorded the episodes of colic, duration of colic, crying intensity, and episodes of defecation. These variables were assessed and compared at the beginning and on the 7th and 14th days. RESULTS: The mean crying duration changed from 4.05 ± 2.44 to 1.41 ± 1.03 h/day (65% decrease) in the olive oil group and from 3.85 ± 1.37 to 1.60 ± 1.32 h/day (58% decrease) in the paraffin group (p = 0.38). The episodes of crying were reduced from 5.79 ± 4.56 to 2.51 ± 4.93 episodes/day (↓57%) in the olive group and from 6.01 ± 3.40 to 3.01 ± 2.40 episodes/day (↓50%) in the paraffin oil group (p = 0.14). Furthermore, the intensity of crying was decreased from 9.04 ± 1.54 to 4.48 ± 2.17 (p < 0.001) in the olive oil group and from 9.0 ± 1.20 to 4.77 ± 1.68 (p < 0.001) in the paraffin oil group. On the 14th day, the crying intensity showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Abdominal massage with olive oil has the same effect as massage with paraffin oil in reducing the symptoms of infantile colic."

      "abstract": "Application of high intensity ultrasound (HIUS) for stabilization of olive oil in water emulsion with different dairy ingredients including sodium caseinate (NaCS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) was investigated. The emulsions were prepared by homogenization with a probe and then treated with either a second homogenization or HIUS at a different power level (20 and 50%) in pulsed or continuous mode for 2 min. The emulsion activity index (EAI), creaming index (CI), specific surface area (SSA), rheological properties, and droplet size of the samples were determined. The temperature of the sample rose when HIUS was applied in continuous mode and at increasing power level. HIUS treatment increased EAI and SSA of the emulsion and decreased droplet size and CI compared with those of the double-homogenized sample. Among the HIUS treatments, the highest EAI was found in the emulsion with NaCS that was treated at a power level of 50% in continuous mode, and the lowest one was obtained by HIUS applied at a power level of 20% in pulsed mode. SSA, droplet size, and span of the emulsion were not affected by HIUS parameters. Rheological properties of HIUS-treated emulsions were not different from those of the double-homogenized control sample. Continuous HIUS at 20% power level and pulsed HIUS at 50% power level reduced creaming in the emulsion after storage at a similar level. HIUS at a low power level or in pulsed mode can be preferred for heat sensitive materials."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sleep deprivation (SD) is a common problem in today's stressful lifestyle and have physiological consequences, including reproductive dysfunction and infertility. As an antioxidant, olive oil may be effective in reducing testicular and spermatological damage by decreasing the production of free radicals. METHODS: This study investigated the effects of olive oil on sperm quality and testicular structure using stereological methods to assess rats with SD. RESULTS: When comparing SD group to grid floor+distilled water (GR) group, we found that the sperm count and motility, as well as the percentage of slow progressive sperm was significantly lower in SD group (p<0.05), but the percentage of immotile sperm was higher (p<0.01). However, no improvement was observed in sperm count or motility after concomitant treatment of SD group with olive oil. Stereological examinations revealed no significant change in the total volumes of the seminiferous tubules, interstitial tissue, and germinal epithelium in the study groups. Conversely, the total number of testicular cell types was significantly lower in SD group than in GR group. Although the total number of Sertoli and Leydig cells was significantly higher in the SD+olive oil group than in the untreated SD group, no significant difference in the total number of other testicular cell types was observed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: SD potentially induced structural changes in testis that affected sperm count and motility. However, olive oil only improved the total number of Sertoli and Leydig cells in the animals with SD and did not improve sperm count and motility."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hydroxytyrosol reduces low-density lipoprotein oxidation, contributing to prevention of atherosclerosis progression. METHODS: In a prospective, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 30 chronic coronary artery syndrome (CCAS) patients were randomized to 4 capsules/day, containing 412.5 mg olive oil with 2.5 mg hydroxytyrosol (OOHT) each one or placebo for 1 month and then were crossed over to the alternate treatment (placebo or OOHT). We measured (a) perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (increased PBR indicates reduced glycocalyx thickness), (b) flow-mediated dilation (FMD), (c) Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) and markers of LV diastolic function by Doppler echocardiography, (d) pulse wave velocity (PWV), and (e) oxidative stress, inflammatory biomarkers and blood lipids at baseline and after treatment. RESULTS: Treatment with OOHT improved PBR, FMD, CFR and PWV compared to baseline (1.8 ± .3 vs. 1.7 ± .4 μm, p = .040, 3.7 ± 2.1 vs. 6.5% ± 2.3%, p < .001, 2.3 ± .4 vs. 2.5 ± .4, p = .030 and 11.1 ± 1.8 vs. 11.8 ± 2.3 m/s, p = .002) while there was no effect after placebo (p = NS). No effect of OOHT treatment was observed on blood pressure. There was a parallel improvement of E' of the mitral annulus and deceleration time of the E wave of mitral inflow after OOHT (p < .05) but not after placebo. Compared to baseline, treatment with OOHT reduced malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, oxidized LDL, triglycerides, PCSK9 and CRP blood levels (p < .05) in contrast to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxytyrosol-enriched olive oil may have beneficial effects on endothelial, arterial and LV diastolic function likely by reducing oxidative and inflammatory burden in CCAS, though further studies are needed to confirm this mechanism.",

      "abstract": "The study intended to determine the effect of temperature (100-200 °C), time (2-6 min), and oil on the bioactive properties and colour parameters of tamarillo puree. The increase in heating temperature (up to 175°C) and time increased the phenolic content, flavonoids content and antioxidant activity. Carotenoids were found to increase from 0.65 to 1.06 (mg β carotene/ g) in puree with oil heated at 200°C for 6 min. In puree with oil, the lightness (L*) and redness (a*) values of puree were found to be reduced, but yellowness (b*), hue angle and chroma improved with treatment temperature and time. Addition of oil exhibited positive influence on retaining the bioactive compounds in comparison to puree without oil, which can be attributed to their enhanced extractability. In conclusion, the desirable effect of heating temperature and time, and addition of virgin olive oil will be helpful in canning of oil enriched tamarillo puree."

      "abstract": "Background Post-surgical therapy in exodontia patients has historically been largely centered on pain and infection prevention. Healing of the extraction wound has rarely received any importance during regular dental extractions, despite being an inherent element of the process of tooth extraction itself. This study aimed to analyze the analgesic and antibacterial efficacy of topical-ozonized olive oil compared to regular drugs administered post-operatively to patients who have undergone tooth extraction as well as evaluate the healing effects of the former on the extraction site. Methodology A total of 200 patients in need of exodontia were randomly divided into two groups, with group A (case group) receiving ozonized olive oil as a topical application for three days and group B (control group) receiving standard post-operative treatment (antibiotics and analgesics). On day five, patients in both groups were assessed for wound healing using the Landry, Turnbull, and Howley Index and for pain using the visual analog scale (VAS). Results On days two and three, the P-value for differences in pain (VAS score) between the two groups was 0.409, but on day five, it was 0.180. According to the Landry, Turnbull, and Howley index, the P-value for differences in wound healing between the groups on day five was 0.025. When comparing the two groups, there was no discernible difference in the amount of discomfort perceived after surgery. While both groups saw improvement in wound healing and pain, the case group coped better than the control group in terms of wound healing. Conclusions This study demonstrated that ozonized olive oil may be used as a safe and effective alternative to conventional painkillers and antibiotics and can speed up wound healing after exodontia."
