      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fowl cholera, caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pasteurella multocida type A, poses a significant threat to chicken production globally. This study investigates the potential of ethanolic extracts from Wild Egyptian Artichoke (WEA) (Cynara cardunculus L. var. sylvestris) to modulate virulence-associated genes and provide an alternative control strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 160 tissue samples from diseased chickens were collected and analyzed. Phenotypic, biochemical (via Vitek 2 Compact), and molecular methods were used to identify P. multocida. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the presence of key adhesion and colonization genes (omp87, ptfA, pfhA) in MDR isolates. The antimicrobial efficacy of WEA ethanolic extract was assessed using disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays. Gene expression changes were evaluated using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR after treatment with sub-inhibitory extract concentrations. RESULTS: Eleven isolates (6.9% prevalence) of P. multocida type A were confirmed, with four showing resistance to over five antimicrobial classes. The ethanolic WEA extract demonstrated significant antibacterial activity, with inhibition zones of up to 25 mm, MIC values ranging from 4 to 16 µg/mL, and MBC values between 8 and 32 µg/mL. Gene expression analysis revealed up to threefold downregulation in omp87 (0.28-fold), pfhA (0.25-fold), and ptfA (0.12-fold) after treatment. CONCLUSION: The WEA ethanolic extract effectively downregulates critical virulence genes in MDR P. multocida, highlighting its potential as a novel natural agent for controlling fowl cholera in chicken. This study emphasizes the importance of exploring plant-based antimicrobials to combat resistance and improve animal health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a major global health concern and plays a significant role in male infertility and hormonal abnormalities by altering the tissue structure of spermatogenic tubes and decreasing the number of spermatogonia. This study investigated the effect of artichoke (Cynara scolymus L) hydroalcoholic extract and Bifidobacterium longum probiotic on sexual hormones, oxidative stress, apoptosis pathway, and histopathological changes in testicular tissues of diabetic rats to find an adjuvant therapy to manage the infertility complications of diabetes. METHODS: In this experiment, 96 male-rats were randomly selected from eight groups. Control, Sham (normal saline), DM group (IP injected with 60 mg/kg STZ), Cynara (400 mg/kg hydroalcoholic extract of Cynara scolymus L), BBL (received 1 × 109 CFU/ml/day Bifidobacterium longum), DM + Cynara, DM + BBL, and DM + Cynara + BBL groups. After 48 days of orally gavage, serum level of FBS (fasting blood sugar), Malondi-aldehyde (MDA), Total-Anti-Oxidant Capacity (TAC), FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (Luteinizing hormone), Testosterone, Testis mRNA-expressions of Protamin (prm1), BCL2, and Caspase-9 genes, as well as stereological changes were measured. RESULTS: In comparison to the diabetic group, the hydroalcoholic extract of Cynara scolymus L combined with the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum resulted in a substantial decrease in FBS (p < 0.001) and MDA(p < 0.05) concentrations, and the expression of the Caspase-9 gene (1.33-fold change). In addition, serum levels of TAC, LH, FSH, Testosterone were significantly increased (p < 0.05). mRNA expression of protamine (p = 0.016) and BCL2 (0.72-fold change) were detected. Furthermore, in comparison with diabetic rats, the Cynara scolymus L-and Bifidobacterium longum-treated groups showed a significant increase in the number of sexual lineage cells, total weight, sperm count, motility, normal morphology, volume of the testis, and volume and length of seminiferous tubules (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated that Cynara scolymus L extract and Bifidobacterium longum supplement had great therapeutic potential, including antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-diabetic, fertility index improvement, and sex hormone modulators."

To retain the benefits of LAB in the commercially used powdered form, highly efficient cryoprotective agents are required during the manufacturing process. This study suggests a novel cryoprotective agent derived from Jerusalem artichoke (JA; Helianthus tuberous L.) and describes the mechanism of cryoprotective effect improvement by sonication treatment. The cryoprotective effect of JA extract was verified by examining the viability of Leuconostoc mesenteroides WiKim33 after freeze-drying (FD). Sonication of JA extract improved the cryoprotective effect. Sonication reduced fructose and glucose contents, which increased the induction of critical damage during FD by 15.84% and 46.81%, respectively. The cryoprotective effects of JA and sonication-treated JA extracts were determined using the viable cell count of Leu. mesenteroides WiKim33. Immediately after FD and storage for 24 weeks, the viability of Leu. mesenteroides WiKim33 with JA extract was 82.8% and 76.3%, respectively, while that of the sonication-treated JA extract was 95.2% and 88.8%, respectively. Our results show that reduction in specific monosaccharides was correlated with improved cryoprotective effect. This study adopted sonication as a novel treatment for improving the cryoprotective effect and verified its efficiency.",

Supplementation with ALE suppressed the NAFLD-induced increases in serum lipids, bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase. In addition, we observed that supplementation with ALE attenuated the increases in antioxidant enzyme activity, mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and apoptosis signaling pathways caused by a high-fat/high-fructose diet. We found that ALE treatment suppressed inflammation and apoptosis caused by H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. These findings suggest that ALE supplementation directly suppresses inflammation and apoptosis in hepatocytes during the development of NAFLD. Based on these results, we suggest that supplementation with ALE may be useful for preventing the progression of liver diseases, including hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma is occupying the eighth position of all malignant neoplasia worldwide. Nowadays, natural compounds found in vegetables and fruits are important resources of many anticancer drugs especially those with high levels of phytochemicals representing an efficient strategy for cancer prevention and treatment. Artichoke (Cynara cardunculus L.) is a kind of antioxidant-rich vegetables demonstrated a potential anticancer activity on various types of cancer cells related to its content of phenolic compounds. Anticarcinogenic effects of polyphenolic extracts were reported to cause a reduction in cell viability, inhibition of cell growth, and initiation of apoptotic mechanisms. The present study aimed to investigate the cell cycle arrest, cytotoxic, and apoptotic effects of artichoke extract against the invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma. RESULTS: A pure extract from the edible part and leaves of fresh artichoke was added to oral squamous carcinoma cell lines and to control group to evaluate the expression of caspase-9, Bcl-2, and Bax genes. Artichoke extract demonstrated the highest cytotoxic effect against cancer cell lines which increased in a time-dependent manner. No apparent effects were observed in the normal control group. Expression of Bax and caspase-9 genes revealed a highly significant increase in cancer cell lines (p = 0.0001) when compared to the control group. In addition to a highly significant decrease (p = 0.005) in Bcl-2 of cancer cells. It was demonstrated that artichoke extract induced cell growth arrest at G2/M phase which revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in comparison to the untreated control group. CONCLUSION: Artichoke exerts potent cell cycle arrest, cytotoxic, and apoptotic effects on oral squamous carcinoma cell lines.",

The biological activity of fructan can be influenced by the degree of polymerization. Thus, in this study, the inhibitory effects of original and fermented purple Jerusalem artichoke (PJA) on α-glucosidase were compared in vitro. Additionally, the anti-diabetes effect of Lactobacillus plantarum-fermented PJA (LJA) was studied in a non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus animal model (C57BIKsJ db/db). MATERIALS/METHODS: The water extract of PJA was fermented by L. plantarum, and two strains of Bacillus subtilis to compare their anti-α-glucosidase activities in vitro by α-glucosidase assays. The anti-diabetes effect of LJA was studied in a non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus animal model (C57BIKsJ db/db) for seven weeks. During the experiment, food intake, body weight, and fasting blood glucose were measured every week. At the end of the treatment period, several diabetic parameters and the intestinal α-glucosidase activity were measured. RESULTS: The LJA showed the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory activity in vitro. In the in vivo study, it resulted in a significantly lower blood glucose concentration than the control. Serum insulin and HDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher and the concentrations of triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, and total cholesterol were significant lower in mice treated with LJA after seven weeks. In addition, the intestinal α-glucosidase activity was partially inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that LJA regulates blood glucose and has potential use as a dietary supplement."

In this study, we investigated the effect of artichoke extract pretreatment on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity. Rats were given artichoke leaf extract (1.5g/kg/day) by gavage for 2 weeks and after then CCl4 (1ml/kg; i.p.) was applied. All rats were killed 24h after the CCl4 injection. CCl4 administration resulted in hepatic necrosis and significant increases in plasma transaminase activities as well as hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and diene conjugate (DC) levels in the liver of rats. Glutathione (GSH) and vitamin C levels decreased, but vitamin E levels increased in the liver of CCl4-treated rats. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities remained unchanged, but glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities decreased following CCl4 treatment. In rats pretreated with artichoke extract, significant decreases in plasma transaminase activities and amelioration in histopathological changes in the liver were observed following CCl4 treatment as compared to CCl4-treated rats. In addition, hepatic MDA and DC levels decreased, but GSH levels and GSH-Px activities increased without any change in other antioxidant parameters following CCl4 treatment in artichoke-pretreated rats. The present findings indicate that in vivo architoke extract administration may be useful for the prevention of oxidative stress-induced hepatotoxicity.",

However, few rigorous clinical trials have assessed the effects of artichoke extract, and none has examined the effects in relation to hangovers. We undertook this study to test whether artichoke extract is effective in preventing the signs and symptoms of alcohol-induced hangover. METHODS: We recruited healthy adult volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age to participate in a randomized double-blind crossover trial. Participants received either 3 capsules of commercially available standardized artichoke extract or indistinguishable, inert placebo capsules immediately before and after alcohol exposure. After a 1-week washout period the volunteers received the opposite treatment. Participants predefined the type and amount of alcoholic beverage that would give them a hangover and ate the same meal before commencing alcohol consumption on the 2 study days. The primary outcome measure was the difference in hangover severity scores between the artichoke extract and placebo interventions. Secondary outcome measures were differences between the interventions in scores using a mood profile questionnaire and cognitive performance tests administered 1 hour before and 10 hours after alcohol exposure. RESULTS: Fifteen volunteers participated in the study. The mean number (and standard deviation) of alcohol units (each unit being 7.9 g, or 10 mL, of ethanol) consumed during treatment with artichoke extract and placebo was 10.7 (3.1) and 10.5 (2.4) respectively, equivalent to 1.2 (0.3) and 1.2 (0.2) g of alcohol per kilogram body weight. The volume of nonalcoholic drink consumed and the duration of sleep were similar during the artichoke extract and placebo interventions. None of the outcome measures differed significantly between interventions. Adverse events were rare and were mild and transient. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that artichoke extract is not effective in preventing the signs and symptoms of alcohol-induced hangover. Larger studies are required to confirm these findings.",

One capsule contained 320 mg of artichoke extract equivalent to 34.3 +/- 0.6 mg/g hydroxycinnamates (caffeic acid derivatives) and 5.6 +/- 0.1 mg/g flavonoids. Polyphenols and phenolic acids present in the artichoke extract were not detected in the urine either as conjugates or aglycones. However, ferulic, isoferulic, dihydroferulic and vanillic acid were identified as major metabolites after beta-glucuronidase treatment of urine. The amount excreted as well as the ratio to that of creatinine, a biomarker for the general excretion rate, increased significantly on the study day compared to the pre-supplementation day. Thus, the caffeic acid esters found in the artichoke extract capsule are absorbed, metabolised and excreted as methylated phenolic acids such as ferulic, isoferulic, dihydroferulic and vanillic acid.",

The relevant differences for the placebo were significant to the extent of p < 0.01 and were clinically relevant. The highest increase in the case of the placebo (139.5%) was seen after 30 minutes. At 120 and 150 minutes the volume of bile secreted under the active treatment was also significantly higher than under the placebo (p < 0.05). In the placebo group, bile secretion fell below the initial level after 3 hours. An effective period of about 120-150 minutes was regarded as satisfactory to influence enzymatic digestion and the motor function of the intestine when the test substance was given postprandially. No side effects nor changes in the laboratory parameters in connection with the experiment were observed. Results indicate that artichoke extract can be recommended for the treatment of dyspepsia, especially when the cause may be attributed to dyskinesia of the bile ducts or disorder in the assimilation of fat."
