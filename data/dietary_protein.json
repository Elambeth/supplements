      "abstract": "Black soldier fly, H. illucens larvae, efficiently convert low-value organic substrates into high-value products, offering solutions to global challenges in sustainable food production and biotechnology. This study investigated the impact of dietary protein levels (10%, 14%, 16%, and 20% crude protein, CP) on BSFL growth, nutrient utilization, and energy retention using isoenergetic diets (18.5 ± 0.3 MJ/kg dry matter) under commercial-scale conditions. Larvae were harvested after 8 days of feeding, with 5 replicates per treatment. Optimal growth performance and feed conversion ratios were observed in larvae fed 14% CP diet, with a quadratic relationship between dietary CP and biomass gain (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.870). Ash and calcium deposition peaked in CP20-fed larvae and were lowest in CP14-fed larvae. Phosphorus and glucosamine deposition remained unaffected, while chitin deposition correlated positively with larval weight. Nitrogen and amino acid retention were highest in CP14-fed larvae but reduced in CP20-fed larvae (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.573-0.902). CP10-fed larvae showed impaired growth and nitrogen deposition but increased fat deposition. These findings establish the CP14 diet as the optimal formulation for scalable BSFL production, providing critical insights into dietary protein effects on BSFL physiology and enabling the development of efficient feeding strategies for industrial-scale farming."

Studies have reported that a diet deficient in essential nutrients may have confounding effect on the toxicity outcome of chemicals. We evaluated the potential impact of PFHxS exposure on the reproductive damage in animals maintained on the diet deficient in protein. Female Wistar rats (n = 6) were divided as controls and treatment groups (5 ppm and 25 ppm PFHxS, protein deficient, protein deficient +5 ppm PFHxS and protein deficient +25 ppm PFHxS). PFHxS exposure disrupted the estrous cycle with an increased duration of the diestrus stage at 25 ppm and protein deficient + 25 ppm PFHxS showing 55.56 % and 78.77 % disorder, respectively. There was a significant elevation (P < 0.01) in LH/FSH ratio and reduction in testosterone (P < 0.01), estradiol (P < 0.01), and progesterone (P < 0.001) in protein deficient + 25 ppm PFHxS group. A high order of increase in lipid profile parameters was found in protein deficient + 25 ppm PFHxS group. However, high-density lipoprotein decreased in this group. Protein deficient + 25 ppm PFHxS group animals also revealed high level of oxidative stress. Histopathological findings revealed the presence of cystic follicles and theca cell degeneration in ovaries in the protein deficient + 25 ppm PFHxS group with a significant decrease (P < 0.01) in the myometrium and endometrial area of uterus. The combined effect of protein deficiency and PFHxS exposure caused a greater reprotoxicity compared to either factor alone implying an increased vulnerability of reproductive function in malnourished populations to environmental contaminants."

      "abstract": "Nutrition plays a fundamental role in poultry production. Developing high-quality diets that ensure positive feed perception by birds is a key strategy for enhancing production performance within the industry. This study evaluated the effect of crude protein (CP) and four essential amino acid (AA) reductions on broiler chickens' growth performance and taste sensitivity for Lysine, Methionine, Threonine, and Tryptophan. Sixty-four one-day-old male broiler chickens (Ross 308) were exposed to four dietary treatments consisting of a balanced (control) diet with a total inclusion of CP and Lysine, Methionine, Threonine, and Tryptophan (T1); diets with a 30 g/kg reduction in CP maintaining 100% exogenous incorporation of the four aforementioned AAs (T2); diets with a 30 g/kg reduction in CP and 50% exogenous incorporation of the same four AAs (T3); and diets with a 30 g/kg reduction in CP with no exogenous incorporation of the four previously mentioned AAs (T4). After 7 days of acclimatization to the diets, the birds were offered Lysine, Methionine, Threonine, and Tryptophan at eight concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5%) each for 4 h/day in a double-choice test for 32 days to determine the preferences and sensory-motivated intake (SMI) of the birds. During the 39-day trial, the birds in the T4 group showed a lower (p < 0.050) average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and body weight (BW) than the birds of the rest of the treatments. No significant effects of the different dietary treatments, CP content, or AA levels were observed on the preferences or SMI of the birds (p > 0.050). However, differences were found in the preferences and SMI between birds from the different treatments when evaluating the treatment × AA × concentration interaction (p < 0.050), reflecting that dietary treatments generate changes in the consumption behavior of birds in response to the delivery of AAs at different concentrations. The preference and SMI thresholds for Lysine decreased in the birds in the T4 group, while the thresholds for Methionine and Tryptophan increased compared to the birds in the control group (p < 0.050). We concluded that the reduction in CP and AAs in the diet of broiler chickens affects their productive parameters and increases their taste sensitivity, which was reflected in lower weight gain and feed conversion efficiency, along with increased preferences and higher SMI values in the birds exposed to diets with more significant nutritional deficits."

      "abstract": "The source of protein in a person's diet affects their total life expectancy. However, the mechanisms by which dietary protein sources differentially impact human health and life expectancy are poorly understood. Dietary choices impact the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota that ultimately modulate host health. This raises the possibility that health outcomes based on dietary protein sources might be driven by interactions between dietary protein and the gut microbiota. In this study, we determined the effects of seven different sources of dietary protein on the gut microbiota of mice using an integrated metagenomics-metaproteomics approach. The protein abundances measured by metaproteomics can provide microbial species abundances, and evidence for the molecular phenotype of microbiota members because measured proteins indicate the metabolic and physiological processes used by a microbial community. We showed that dietary protein source significantly altered the species composition and overall function of the gut microbiota. Different dietary protein sources led to changes in the abundance of microbial proteins involved in the degradation of amino acids and the degradation of glycosylations conjugated to dietary protein. In particular, brown rice and egg white protein increased the abundance of amino acid degrading enzymes. Egg white protein increased the abundance of bacteria and proteins usually associated with the degradation of the intestinal mucus barrier. These results show that dietary protein sources can change the gut microbiota's metabolism, which could have major implications in the context of gut microbiota mediated diseases."

      "abstract": "Diet is believed to be an important mediator of oncogenesis and response to anti-cancer therapies, although no evidence-based dietary guidelines exist for patients with cancer. Limiting protein intake can suppress tumor growth by both inducing nutrient stress and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. However, little is known about the impact of reducing dietary protein on the efficacy of chemotherapy, the most widely used anti-cancer treatment. Here, we present evidence that reducing protein intake in mice by 50% stops the growth of established tumors, in parallel with inducing a stress response and DNA damage. Further, a reduced protein (RP) diet enhances tumor regression upon treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This effect is accompanied by elevated apoptosis and suppressed mitosis of tumor cells. Proteomic analysis of tumors revealed marked differences between 5-FU treated mice fed control or RP diet including decreased abundance of proteins that mediate DNA repair and replication in mice consuming RP. In vitro studies mimicking amino acid changes found in tumors from RP-fed mice showed that cGAS/STING1 signaling, including transcription of Interferon beta 1, was maximally increased in 5-FU treated cells cultured in modified amino acid medium. These findings correlated with enhanced immune cell influx into tumors from mice treated with 5-FU while consuming a RP diet, an effect that was causally linked to improved response to chemotherapy. Collectively, these findings suggest that reducing dietary protein in cancer patients may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy by promoting anti-tumor immunity."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Sufficient protein intake is important for older adults to prevent sarcopenia. Better insight into dietary characteristics may be helpful to improve daily protein intake. Therefore, this study aimed to compare characteristics of community-dwelling older adults with distinct amounts of daily protein intake. METHODS: Baseline data of older adults (age >55 years) from eight intervention studies were pooled. Protein intake was measured using 24-h recalls or 3-day food records. Participants were stratified into one of four different groups based on their habitual protein intake (<0.8 g per kilogram bodyweight per day (g/kg/d), 0.8-0.99 g/kg/d, 1.0-1.2 g/kg/d and >1.2 g/kg/d). Protein intake per meal, animal-versus plant-based protein intake, daily protein distribution patterns (e.g. spread or pulse) and the protein intake from distinct protein-rich food categories (meat, fish, dairy, grains and others) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 814 participants (69 ± 9 years, 54 % male), mean protein intake was 0.98 ± 0.30 g/kg/d. 28 % (n = 227) of the population had a protein intake <0.8 g/kg/d, 29 % (n = 240) 0.8-0.99 g/kg/d, 22 % (n = 179) 1.0-1.2 g/kg/d and 21 % (n = 168) >1.2 g/kg/d. Higher protein intake groups had a lower body weight and BMI and a higher energy intake per day. Although protein intake distribution patterns did not differ across groups, meals with >20 g or >0.4 g protein per kilogram bodyweight per meal more often occurred in the higher protein intake groups. Protein intake was the lowest at breakfast followed by lunch and dinner, in all groups. Higher protein intake groups consumed a higher proportion of animal-based protein sources. CONCLUSION: Distinct protein intake groups showed comparable intake distribution patterns, with lowest protein consumption at breakfast and highest at dinner. Nevertheless, the highest protein intake group more often consumed >20 gr of protein per meal, indicating that a focus on the absolute amount of protein per meal, particularly at breakfast, could further optimize daily protein intake in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: In this study, we investigated the free-living nutritional intake of older people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and examined the relationship between nutritional intake and skeletal muscle mass. Methods: Subjects aged 65 years or older with T2D who visited the Kansai Electric Power Hospital between 2015 and 2017 and had not yet received nutritional guidance or intervention at our hospital comprised the study group. Nutritional intake (energy, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate intake) was calculated from a 3-day dietary diary by the participants, and the relationship between nutritional intake and the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was retrospectively investigated. Results: In total, 91 subjects were recruited (53 males and 38 females, aged 70.3 ± 5.5 years). The energy and protein intakes were 28.7 ± 6.1 kcal/kg/day and 1.2 ± 0.3 g/kg/day, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the SMI and energy and protein intake (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis with the SMI as the dependent variable and age, gender, protein intake, lipid intake, and carbohydrate intake as the independent variables revealed protein intake to be an independent determinant of the SMI. Conclusions: In older people with T2D, the energy and protein intakes are likely to be lower than the recommended levels. Appropriate interventions for protein intake and energy intake are recommended to prevent loss of muscle mass in Japanese older people with type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Reducing dietary CP concentration can reduce feeding costs and N excretion in dairy production but may negatively impact productivity and efficiency. This study investigated the impact of reduced dietary CP concentration, across early, mid- and late-lactation stages in primiparous and multiparous lactating cows, on productivity, feed and energy use efficiency and CH4 emission parameters. Twenty-four Holstein-Friesian (12 primiparous, 12 multiparous) cows were allocated to three experimental total mixed rations containing 12.2, 15.1 or 18.1% CP (LCP, MCP and HCP, respectively; DM basis), in a continuous study across lactation (days 1-305). Digestibility and gas exchanges were measured in metabolism units and indirect open-circuit respiration calorimeter chambers during early, mid- and late-lactation. Data were analysed using a linear mixed model, with repeated measures, with CP concentration, stage of lactation, parity and their interactions as fixed effects, and a random effect of cow fitted as the subject and stage of lactation as the repeated measure. When compared with LCP treatment, MCP and HCP had higher DM intake (DMI) (+1.9 and +3.0 kg/d), milk yield (+5.5 and +7.7 kg/d), energy corrected milk yield (ECMY) (+5.0 and +7.1 kg/d), and feed efficiency (ECMY/DMI, +0.13 and +0.15 kg/kg; milk solids/DMI, +16 and +20 g/kg; milk energy output (EL)/DMI, +0.40 and 0.46 MJ/kg). Digestible energy intake (DEI)/gross energy intake (GEI), metabolisable energy intake (MEI)/GEI, MEI/DEI and milk energy output adjusted for zero energy balance (EL(0))/MEI were higher in HCP (+0.02, +0.03, +0.02, and +0.06 MJ/MJ) than LCP while there were no differences between LCP and MCP for DEI/GEI, or between MCP and HCP for MEI/DEI and EL(0)/MEI. Methane production per digestible DMI and ECMY were lower for MCP (-3.2 and -3.1 g/kg) and HCP (-3.8 and -3.4 g/kg), when compared with LCP. Methane energy per GEI, DEI and MEI were lower for the MCP (-0.007, -0.011 and -0.014 MJ/MJ) and HCP (-0.007, -0.014 and -0.017 MJ/MJ) than LCP. The significant interaction between CP concentration and stage of lactation on milk yield and ECMY showed that treatment differences (increased values in MCP or HCP vs LCP diets) reduced as lactation progressed. A diet containing 15.1% CP (DM basis) may be sufficient to maintain milk production and feed efficiency while reducing CH4 yield and intensity. However, regression analysis suggests that productivity may increase further between 15 and 18% CP (DM basis) but the response to dietary CP may depend on the stage of lactation.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent liver disease, mainly associated with excessive accumulation of fat in the liver. It has become a global health concern. The diagnosis of NAFLD is often done through liver biopsy; however, noninvasive methods have their own advantages. Dietary intervention, especially increased dietary protein alongside managing overall body weight, have been shown to be a promising strategy to lessen the impact of NAFLD. Dietary protein has been shown to reduce fat accumulation in the liver by increasing liver metabolism, eliciting satiety, improving insulin sensitivity, and enhancing muscle mass retention, collectively aiding in weight management. Both animal and plant proteins have benefits; however, plant proteins have demonstrated more metabolic advantages, while animal proteins have more downsides. Bridging the protein gap is critical, particularly in areas with limited availability to high-quality protein or in populations where dietary protein intake is inadequate. This commentary highlights the importance of obtaining sufficient protein from readily available and sustainable food sources. Furthermore, diets high in protein, like the Mediterranean diet, have proven to delay the advancement and likelihood of NAFLD. In conclusion, adequate dietary protein plays a crucial part in diminishing the risk of NAFLD, and efforts in public health should concentrate on addressing protein deficiency to decrease the growing burden of liver disease."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Experimental studies have demonstrated that nutritional changes during development can result in phenotypic changes to mammalian cheek teeth. This developmental plasticity of tooth morphology is an example of phenotypic plasticity. Because tooth development occurs through complex interactions between manifold processes, there are many potential mechanisms which can contribute to a tooth's norm of reaction. Determining the identity of those mechanisms and the relative importance of each of them is one of the main challenges to understanding phenotypic plasticity. Quantitative proteomics combined with experimental studies allow for the identification of potential molecular contributors to a plastic response through quantification of expressed gene products. Here, we present the results of a quantitative proteomics analysis of mature upper first molars (M1s) in Mus musculus from a controlled feeding experiment. Pregnant and nursing mothers were fed either a low-dietary protein (10%) treatment diet or control (20%) diet. Expression of tooth-related proteins, immune system proteins, and actin-based myosin proteins were significantly altered in our low-dietary protein sample. The recovery of expression change in tooth development proteins was anticipated and consistent with previous proteomic studies. We also identified differential immune protein response along with systematic reduction in actin-based myosin protein expression, which are novel discoveries for tooth proteomics studies. We propose that studies which aim to elucidate specific mechanisms of molar phenotypic plasticity should prioritize investigations into the relationships between IGF regulation and tooth development and actin-based myosin expression and tooth development. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: A low-protein diet during development results in significantly altered protein expression for major dental building proteins, immune system proteins, and actin-based myosin proteins within Mus musculus ."

The objective of this work is to study productive performances of heavy Duroc X (Landrace X Large white) male and female pigs during the finishing stage under a 2% CP reduction with crystalline AA supplementation. A total of 60 entire male and 60 female pigs (means ± standard deviations: 109 ± 4.9 days of age; 67.9 ± 7.18 kg of body weight) were distributed in split-sex pens (6 pigs/pen) and fed ad libitum. Two isoenergetic diets were provided (145 and 125 g CP/kg with AA supplementation, control and low-CP) during the final 42 days of finishing period. Growth performance, carcass and meat traits were evaluated. The fixed effects of dietary treatment, sex and their interaction were considered and simple least squares models used. Males were 7.25% heavier (p < 0.001) and had 16% higher average daily gains (p < 0.0001) than females in both treatments with no differences in feed intake or feed conversion ratio (p > 0.05). Nitrogen efficiency was 35% higher in low-CP males. Little difference was found for most carcass and meat traits between treatments. Males had 7-8% higher loin subcutaneous fat thickness in both dietary treatments (p = 0.011). Males and females of the low-CP diet showed higher fat and saturated fat contents than controls (p = 0.020). A 20 g/kg CP reduction with AA supplementation is an efficient strategy during the finishing phase without productivity losses in heavy Duroc sire line genotypes of both sexes."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Protein supplementation has been proposed as an effective dietary strategy for maintaining or increasing skeletal muscle mass and improving physical performance in middle-aged and older adults. Diabetes mellitus exacerbates muscle mass loss, leading to many older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) experiencing sarcopenia, and vice versa. Our objective was to assess the impact of increased dietary protein intake on muscle mass, strength, physical performance, and the progression of T2DM in middle-aged and older adults diagnosed with this condition. METHODS: A 12-week randomized, controlled, parallel pilot study was conducted with 26 patients diagnosed with T2DM and had either low muscle mass, or low muscle strength or poor physical performance (age > 55 years old), aiming to investigate the effects of a protein-rich diet in sarcopenic and metabolic markers. The control group received 0.8-1.0 g/kg/day, while the intervention group received 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day of protein respectively. Body composition, muscle mass/strength and biochemical parameters were measured before and after the intervention period. RESULTS: Different kinetics of skeletal muscle index (SMI), appendicular lean mass (ALM), hand grip strength (HGS), gait speed (GS) and standing balance (SB) (p < 0.05) were observed between two groups. Specifically, the intervention group showed a significant improvement in HGS (p < 0.001) and physical performance (timed-up-and-go, p < 0.001; GS, p = 0.011; SB, p = 0.022), while the control group had its ALM (p = 0.014), SMI (p = 0.011) and HGS (p = 0.011) significantly reduced. The kinetics of metabolic markers indices was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: Current recommendation for protein intake (0.8-1 g/kg/day) is certainly not enough to ameliorate the muscle mass loss in middle age and older adults' individuals with T2DM. In contrast, protein intake of 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day seems to be a more appropriate recommendation to combat upcoming sarcopenia, nonetheless the progression of T2DM was not interrupted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both obesity and iron deficiency are public health problems. The association between the two problems could be explained by chronic low-grade inflammation in obesity, which could stimulate hepcidin expression and modify iron concentration that the consumption of high-protein diets could prevent. Thus, this study aimed to compare the effects of high-protein diets with a predominance of animal or vegetable protein on serum hepcidin and iron concentrations in adults with obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: This randomized clinical trial involved adults with obesity and insulin resistance, who were assigned to either a high animal protein (AP) group or a high vegetable protein (VP) group for a one-month intervention. Both groups followed a calorie-restricted diet, reducing energy intake by 750 kcal/day. Baseline and final measurements included serum concentrations of hepcidin and iron, biochemical parameters, anthropometric data, and body composition. A total of 33 participants (63 % female) were included in the study. Significant weight loss was observed in both groups after the intervention. Adjusted for weight loss percentage, the AP group showed a significant increase in hepcidin concentration (from 22.3 ± 14.7 to 27.5 ± 19.5 ng/mL) compared to the VP group (from 17.9 ± 15.1 to 17.2 ± 10.1 ng/mL) (p < 0.01), with no changes in serum iron concentration. Additionally, the VP diet significantly reduced serum adiponectin (p = 0.04) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.03) levels. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with obesity following the AP diet for one month, hepcidin levels increased without affecting serum iron concentrations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03627104.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a compensatory growth model using growing beef cattle by changing dietary protein and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of compensatory protein deposition in muscle tissue. Twelve Charolais bulls were randomly assigned to one of two groups with two periods: 1) a control group (CON) fed a 13% crude protein (CP) diet for 6 weeks; 2) a treatment group (REC) fed a 7% CP diet for 4 weeks (restriction period) and fed a 13% CP diet in the following 2 weeks (re-alimentation period). Growth performance, digestibility, nitrogen balance, targeted metabolomics of amino acids (AA) in plasma, and transcriptional profiling in muscle tissue were analyzed. Protein restriction decreased average daily gain (ADG; P < 0.05), while protein re-alimentation increased ADG relative to the CON (P < 0.05). Compared to the CON, REC reduced retained N (P < 0.05), and protein re-alimentation increased retained N and N utilization efficiency (P < 0.05), due to reduced urinary urea, hippuric acid, and creatinine excretions (P < 0.05). Ruminal NH3-N in the REC was lower than that in the CON in the protein re-alimentation period (P < 0.05). However, there was no difference in microbial protein and plasma urea nitrogen concentrations. Dietary protein restriction decreased plasma valine and aspartic acid concentrations relative to the CON (P < 0.05), and increased proline and 3-methyl-L-histidine concentrations (P < 0.05). After dietary protein re-alimentation, REC increased plasma citrulline concentrations (P < 0.05). The transcriptional profiling revealed that REC upregulated the AA transporter SLC3A1, and protein re-alimentation downregulated SLC7A8 in the muscle cell membrane. Within the muscle cell, upregulated cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 2 (CASTOR2) inhibited protein synthesis by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 phosphorylation in the protein restriction period, while DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) activated the mTOR signaling pathway and promoted protein synthesis in the protein re-alimentation period. In summary, the targeted metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses demonstrated that protein re-alimentation following restriction can promote protein synthesis and reduce muscle breakdown by regulating AA metabolism and functional transcripts related to AA transporters and the mTOR signaling pathway."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one Awassi ewes nursing single lambs were individually housed and assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups (2 × 2 factorial design). Ewes in treatment groups were (with supplemental RPL and RPM) or were not (without supplemental RPL and RPM) supplemented with lysine (8.5 gm/day) and methionine (4 gm/day) and were fed diets containing either 13.2 (moderate protein) or 11.1% (low protein) protein. RESULTS: No interactions between supplemental AA and dietary protein levels were observed. Supplying ewes with L and M did not affect (p ≥ 0.06) their nutrient intake or their final body weights (BWs). Additionally, milk composition, yield, and efficiency were not affected by supplemental L and M. Decreasing dietary protein levels did not affect (p = 0.13) the final BWs, milk yield, composition, and efficiency but decreased (p < 0.01) nutrient intake of ewes. CONCLUSION: Under our study conditions, reducing the protein contents of the diets from 13.2% to 11.1% had no negative impact on late-nursing ewes. Regardless of dietary protein level, the beneficial effect of supplying L and M was not evident."

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of CP, E:T, and net energy (NE) on broiler performance. The treatments were as follows: T1-reduced CP (16%, RP), low NE (9.9 MJ/kg, LNE), low E:T (0.56, LE:T); T2-RP, LNE, high E:T (0.60, HE:T), with imbalanced EAA (excess Met and deficient Thr); T3-RP, high NE (10.4 MJ/kg, HNE), LE:T; T4-RP, HNE, HE:T; T5-normal CP (18%, NP), LNE, LE:T; T6-NP, LNE, HE:T; T7-NP, HNE, LE:T; and T8-NP, HNE, HE:T. The study employed as-hatched Cobb 500 broilers in two experiments. Exp.1 studied the broiler performance from d19 to 35, with eight replicates per treatment and 16 birds per replicate (n = 1024). Birds were randomly assigned to different treatments, and at the end of their lives, all were dissected to determine their sex and account for any gender-related effects. Exp.2 measured NE values in respiration chambers from d25 to 28, with six replicates per treatment, and two birds (a male and a female) per replicate (n = 96). The bird gender was determined through high-resolution melting curve analysis of feather DNA. The measured NE values were used to calculate NE intake (NEi) in Exp.1. The results showed that T4 improved (p < 0.001) weight gain (WG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and NEi relative to T1, T2, and T3, and protein efficiency (WG/CP intake) relative to all treatments. The live performance (feed intake, WG, FCR) and NEi of birds fed T4 reached a level equal to those of birds fed NP diets (T5 to T8). These results suggest that a dietary E:T ratio of 0.60 is necessary to maximize nutrient utilization and to restore growth rate in broilers fed RP diets."

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to elucidate the effect of different levels of dietary protein during late pregnancy on the performance of Black Bengal does and their kids. Twelve does were divided into three groups, with four in each, and three diets, i.e., high protein (18% CP), medium protein (14% CP), and low protein (10% CP) were supplied for 50 days, commencing from 100 days post-coitum to parturition. During the first 100 days of pregnancy, uniform rations with similar ingredients were provided to fulfill the nutrient requirements depending on the live weight of does. All three diets were isocaloric (10.0 MJ/kg DM). Data were subjected to one-way ANOVA, and the significance of the difference among means was determined by Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The main effects of diet and sex, as well as their interaction, were analyzed by two-way ANOVA by using the GLM procedure. The relative expression values of qPCR were calculated by using the 2-ΔΔCt analysis method. Live weight gain was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in high-protein-fed dams than other groups during the experimental period. The milk yield of does was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in high-protein-fed goats than in the low-protein group. The lactation length of does was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the high- and medium-protein-fed does than in the low-protein-fed does. The duration of post-partum anestrus of does was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the low-protein-fed dams than in the high-protein group. The birth weight of kids tended to be higher in the high-protein group but did not differ significantly among the treatment groups. In male kids, weaning weight, final weight, live weight gain, and average daily gain were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than in female kids. Weaning weight was higher (p < 0.05) in kids of the high-protein-fed does than the low-protein group. Final weight and live weight gain were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of the high-protein-fed does than in the low-protein-fed group. On the other hand, average daily gain was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of the high- and medium-protein-fed does than the low-protein group. The average body length and wither height of kids at the 32nd week was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of high-protein-fed does than those of the low-protein-fed group. The average heart girth of kids at the 32nd week was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of high-protein-fed does than the medium- and low-protein groups. The survival rate of kids was higher in the medium- and high-protein-fed does than in low-protein group. Hot carcass weight and ether extract content of meat were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the high-protein group than in the other groups. The dressing percentage was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the kids of high-protein-fed does than low-protein-fed goats. The expression of the H-FABP gene was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of high-protein-fed does than those of the medium- and low-protein groups. In conclusion, maternal dietary protein levels positively influences the production performance of Black Bengal does and their kids."

      "abstract": "The postweaning period in pigs is a critical window where nutritional interventions are implemented to prevent postweaning diarrhea (PWD) and antibiotic use. One common strategy is feeding low-protein diets immediately following weaning. This intervention may reduce protein fermentation and pathogen proliferation, therefore decreasing the incidence of postweaning diarrhea. These effects may also be mitigated by providing dietary fiber. However, studies examining the role of protein and fiber on gastrointestinal microbiota and metabolism are complicated by the presence of other substrates, including polyphenols and antinutritional factors in complex ingredients. In this study, semipurified diets formulated to meet nutrient requirements were fed to 40 weaned pigs (n = 10/diet) to examine the effects of high protein (HP), high fiber (HF), or both (HFHP) compared with a control (CON) diet with industry-standard crude protein and fiber content. Critical alterations in host metabolism and cecal transcriptome were identified in response to the CON diet. Diets with lower protein levels (CON and HF) induced alteration in transcripts from the serine synthesis pathways and integrated stress response in cecal tissue alongside systemic increases in metabolic pathways related to lysine degradation. High protein diets did not induce increases in gastrointestinal pathogen abundance. These results challenge the practice of feeding low-protein diets postweaning, by demonstrating a detrimental effect on intestinal cell function and muscle accretion. This suggests that with careful ingredient selection, increased dietary protein postweaning could improve pig health and growth compared with a standard diet.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although low-protein diets are commonly used for weaned pigs and are thought to decrease diarrhea incidence, this study showed that low-protein diets may induce muscle catabolism and intestinal epithelial stress response. Eventhough high-protein diets increased protein fermentation by gut microbes, no increase in diarrhea was detected. Protein fermentation was mitigated by fiber while still supporting growth and intestinal epithelial cell function, suggesting new strategies for feeding weaned pigs with careful ingredient selection.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Glucagon has long been proposed as a component of multi-agonist obesity therapeutics due to its ability to induce energy expenditure and cause weight loss. However, chronic glucagon-receptor agonism has been associated with a reduction in circulating amino acids and loss of lean mass. Importantly, it is currently not known whether the metabolic benefits of glucagon can be maintained under contexts that allow the defence of lean mass. METHODS: We investigate the metabolic effects of the long-acting glucagon receptor agonist, G108, when administered to obese mice at low-doses, and with dietary protein supplementation. RESULTS: Dietary protein supplementation can only fully defend lean mass at a low dose of G108 that is sub-anorectic and does not reduce fat mass. However, in this context, G108 is still highly effective at improving glucose tolerance and reducing liver fat in obese mice. Mechanistically, liver RNA-Seq analysis reveals that dietary protein supplementation defends anabolic processes in low-dose G108-treated mice, and its effects on treatment-relevant glucose and lipid pathways are preserved. CONCLUSION: Glucagon-mediated energy expenditure and weight loss may be mechanistically coupled to hypoaminocidemia and lean mass loss. However, our data suggest that glucagon can treat MAFLD at doses which allow full defence of lean mass given sufficient dietary protein intake. Therefore, proportionate glucagon therapy may be safe and effective in targeting hepatocytes and improving in glycaemia and liver fat.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Dietary protein is a key component of all dietary patterns. It has been demonstrated that there are subtle differences in health implications associated with the source of dietary protein consumed. This study examined dietary protein sources (DPSs) in a long-term study of diet-induced obesity ± ammonium hydroxide enhancement (AHE) and its role in improving long-term health outcomes. (2) Methods: Over 18 months, 272 C3H/HeJ mice (136 male and 136 female) were monitored on high-fat diets with varying DPSs ± AHE. Mice were monitored for weekly change in total mass, as well as 6-month assessments of lean and fat mass. At each assessment, a cohort (~8 mice per diet per sex) was censored for a cross-sectional examination of organ function. (3) Results: Longevity was improved in females fed AHE diets, regardless of DPSs. Females' measures of fat and lean mass were markedly elevated with casein protein diets compared to beef protein diets regardless of AHE. Females fed a beef protein diet + AHE demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass with aging. In males, AHE beef protein diet-fed mice showed marked improvement to longevity and increased lean mass at 6 months. (4) Conclusions: This study demonstrates that dietary protein modification by AHE attenuates the negative impacts of HF diets in both males and females in a sex-dependent manner. Furthermore, the results from this study emphasize the importance of identifying the differences in the utilization of dietary proteins in both a sex- and age-related manner and demonstrate the potential of DPS modification by AHE as a dietary intervention.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a multifactorial age-related disorder that causes a decrease in muscle mass, strength, and function, leading to alteration of movement, risk of falls, and hospitalization. This article aims to review recent findings on the factors underlying sarcopenia and the strategies required to delay and counteract its symptoms. We focus on molecular factors linked to ageing, on the role of low-grade chronic and acute inflammatory conditions such as cancer, which contributes to the onset of sarcopenia, and on the clinical criteria for its diagnosis. The use of drugs against sarcopenia is still subject to debate, and the suggested approaches to restore muscle health are based on adequate dietary protein intake and physical exercise. We also highlight the difference in the amount and quality of amino acids within animal- and plant-based diets, as studies have often shown varying results regarding their effect on sarcopenia in elderly people. In addition, many studies have reported that non-pharmacological approaches, such as an optimization of dietary protein intake and training programs based on resistance exercise, can be effective in preventing and delaying sarcopenia. These approaches not only improve the maintenance of skeletal muscle function, but also reduce health care costs and improve life expectancy and quality in elderly people."

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a widespread metabolic disorder and results from insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Modifiable factors like diet, physical activity, and body weight play crucial roles in diabetes prevention, with targeted interventions reducing diabetes risk by about 60%. High-protein consumption, above the recommended intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, have often explored in relation to diabetes risk. However, the relationship between dietary protein and diabetes is multifaceted. Observational studies have linked high total and animal protein intake to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, particularly in obese women. Elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), which can result from dietary intake, protein breakdown, as well as an impaired catabolism, are strong predictors of cardiometabolic risk and insulin resistance. With several mechanism linking BCAA to insulin resistance. On the other hand, intervention studies suggest that high-protein diets can support weight loss and improve cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the impact on insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis is not straightforward. Proteins and amino acids stimulate both insulin and glucagon secretion, influencing glucose levels, but chronic effects remain uncertain. This short narrative review aims to provide an update on the relationship between increased dietary protein intake, amino acids, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and to describe protein recommendations for type 2 diabetes."

We aimed to determine the acute effects of protein ingestion from different dietary sources on the postprandial metabolic response, amino acid levels, and circulating miRNA expression in adults with obesity and IR. This clinical trial included adults with obesity and IR who consumed (1) animal-source protein (AP; calcium caseinate) or (2) vegetable-source protein (VP; soy protein isolate). Glycaemic, insulinaemic, and glucagon responses, amino acid levels, and exosomal microRNAs isolated from plasma were analysed. Post-AP ingestion, the area under the curve (AUC) of insulin (p = 0.04) and the plasma concentrations of branched-chain (p = 0.007) and gluconeogenic (p = 0.01) amino acids increased. The effects of different types of proteins on the concentration of miRNAs were evaluated by measuring their plasma circulating levels. Compared with the baseline, the AP group presented increased circulating levels of miR-27a-3p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-122-5p (p < 0.05). Subsequent analysis over time at 0, 30, and 60 min revealed the same pattern and differences between treatments. We demonstrated that a single dose of dietary protein has acute effects on hormonal and metabolic regulation and increases exosomal miRNA expression in individuals with obesity and IR.",

This study aimed to investigate the adaptive effects of microbiome and the properties of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in response to dietary protein shifts. Twelve Charolais bulls were randomly divided into two groups based on initial body weight: 1) Treatment (REC), where the animals received a 7 % CP diet in a 4-week restriction period, followed by a 13 % CP diet in a 2-week re-alimentation period; 2) Control (CON), where the animals were fed the 13 % CP diet both in the restriction period and the re-alimentation period. Protein restriction decreased the concentrations of acetate, propionate, isovalerate, glutamine, glutamate, and isoleucine (P < 0.05), while protein re-alimentation increased the concentrations of arginine, methionine sulfoxide, lysine, and glutamate (P < 0.05). Protein restriction decreased the relative abundances of Bacteroidota but increased Proteobacteria, with no difference observed after re-alimentation. Protein restriction decreased relative abundances of the genera Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium. Following protein recovery, Escherichia was enriched in CON, while Pusillibacter was enriched in REC, indicating that distinct microbial adaptations to protein shifts. Protein restriction increased GH97 while reducing GH94 and GT35 compared to CON. Protein restriction decreased abundances of KO genes involved in VFA production pathways, while they were recovered in the re-alimentation period. Protein restriction reduced tet(W/32/O) abundances but increased those of tet(X), nimJ, and rpoB2. Following protein re-alimentation, there was a decrease in ErmQ and tet(W/N/W), and an increase in Mef(En2) compared to CON, highlighting the impact of dietary protein on the distribution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Overall, comprehensive metagenomic analysis reveals the dynamic adaptability of the microbiome in response to dietary shifts, indicating its capacity to modulate carbohydrate metabolism and ARGs in response to protein availability.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A growing literature suggests manipulating dietary protein status decreases sweet consumption in rodents and in humans. Underlying neurocircuit mechanisms have not yet been determined, but previous work points towards hedonic rather than homeostatic pathways. Here we hypothesized that a history of protein restriction reduces sucrose seeking by altering mesolimbic dopamine signaling. METHODS: We tested this hypothesis using established behavioral tests of palatability and motivation, including the 'palatability contrast' and conditioned place preference (CPP) tests. We used modern optical sensors for measuring real-time nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine dynamics during sucrose consumption, via fiber photometry, in male C57/Bl6J mice maintained on low-protein high-carbohydrate (LPHC) or control (CON) diet for ∼5 weeks. RESULTS: A history of protein restriction decreased the consumption of a sucrose 'dessert' in sated mice by ∼50% compared to controls [T-test, p< 0.05]. The dopamine release in NAc during sucrose consumption was reduced, also by ∼50%, in LPHC-fed mice compared to CON [T-test, p< 0.01]. Furthermore, LPHC-feeding blocked the sucrose-conditioned place preference we observed in CON-fed mice [paired T-test, p< 0.05], indicating reduced motivation. This was accompanied by a 33% decrease in neuronal activation of the NAc core, as measured by c-Fos immunolabeling from brains collected directly after the CPP test. CONCLUSIONS: Despite ongoing efforts to promote healthier dietary habits, adherence to recommendations aimed at reducing the intake of added sugars and processed sweets remains challenging. This study highlights chronic dietary protein restriction as a nutritional intervention that suppresses the motivation for sucrose intake, via blunted sucrose-evoke dopamine release in NAc."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pose a triple burden in India. Almost two-thirds of people with diabetes (PWD) in India are found to have suboptimal glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control. Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in diabetes has emphasized on the amount and type of carbohydrates for years. However, protein, an important macronutrient in diabetes management, needs to be focused upon, especially in India, where the consumption is found to be lower than the recommendations provided by most guidelines. AIM: An expert committee attempted to review the role of dietary protein in the management of T2DM, arrive at a consensus on the significance of increasing dietary protein for various benefits, and offer practical guidance on ways to improve protein intake among Indians. METHODOLOGY: A total of 10 endocrinologists and diabetologists, one nephrologist, and three registered dietitians representing four zones of India formed the expert committee. An in-depth review of literature in the Indian context was carried out, and the draft document was shared with the expert committee, and their views were incorporated into the same. The expert committee then assembled virtually to deliberate on various aspects of the role of protein in T2DM management. The experts from various specialties gave their valuable inputs and suggestions from their extensive personal clinical experience and research work, which helped to reach a consensus on the role and significance of protein in the management of T2DM and its complications in India. RESULTS: There is abundant evidence that MNT is essential for the prevention and management of T2DM and its complications. Experts agreed that increasing protein intake offers myriad health benefits, namely reducing glycemic variability, improving glycemic control, increasing insulin sensitivity, improvement in lipid profile and immunity, and helping in weight management and preservation of muscle mass in PWD. The expert committee suggested aiming for an increase in protein intake by at least 5-10% of the current intake in lieu of carbohydrates in PWD. Experts also highlighted the need for more data quantifying the unmet protein needs in the Indian PWD, especially among vegetarians. Randomized controlled trials to study the effect of protein in diabetes complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and comorbid conditions such as sarcopenia among the Indian population are also warranted. CONCLUSION: Increasing protein quantity and quality in the diets of Indian PWD could significantly contribute to positive health outcomes. Increased protein intake, preferably through dietary sources to meet the requirements and, when required using diabetes-specific protein supplements (DSPS), is recommended in the prevention and control of T2DM.",

In the present study, effect of varying dietary protein levels was evaluated on the survival, growth parameters and proximate composition of C. batrachus. Diets comprising 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, and 50% crude protein (CP) were supplied to fish in T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6, respectively, at the rate of 5% of fish body weight for the entire 90 days, twice daily. Size of each stocked C. batrachus was recorded after 15 days. Results revealed 100% survival rate of C. batrachus in all treatments. Significantly highest (P<0.001) mean value of weight gain (g/fish), percent weight gain, daily growth rate, specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio (PER) in C. batrachus were recorded, reared in T4 by feeding 40% CP in diet. The best FCR value (1.90±0.02) for C. batrachus was obtained in T4 by feeding 40%CP in diet. Mean value of water, ash, fat and protein contents (wet mass) were ranged 74.10-79.23%, 3.12-4.68%, 3.90-4.43% and 13.09-16.79% for C. batrachus in the studied treatment groups. Water content (%) was found significantly (P<0.05) higher in the body of C. batrachus for T1, T2, T3 and T6 than for T4 and T5. Ash was found significantly (P<0.05) higher in the fish reared in T4 and T5. Fat content in the wet body mass of C. batrachus was found significantly higher in T4 and T1. While, significant higher (P<0.05) values of mean protein content was noted in C. batrachus reared in T4 and T5. Body composition of C. batrachus was also categorically affected by body size, however, condition factor showed non-significant correlation in most of the relationships in the present study. Overall, results indicated that feeding appropriate diet (containing 40% CP) to the fish resulted good growth performance, lower FCR and higher protein content in the fish. Present study provides valuable knowledge of optimal dietary protein level in C. batrachus which will help in commercial success of aquaculture.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 consensus emphasized nutritional assessment and intervention for community-dwelling older people with sarcopenia status. This study aimed to examine the association of serum albumin and dietary protein intake (DPI) with all-cause mortality among older adults at risk of sarcopenia. METHODS: We enrolled 1763 older adults at risk of sarcopenia in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (2012-2018) using calf circumference and handgrip strength. Serum albumin concentrations were measured using bromocresol green methods, and DPI frequency was evaluated using a semi-quantitative questionnaire at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the association of serum albumin and DPI with all-cause mortality. RESULTS: During 5606.3 person-years of follow-up (median: 3.28 years), 802 older people died. After adjusting for socio-demographics, health behaviors, and clinical characteristics, we observed an inverse linear association between serum albumin and all-cause mortality (Pnon-linear = 0.429). Participants with low albumin levels (<40.0 g/L) had a 43 % higher risk of mortality than their counterparts (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-1.66). There was no significant association between DPI and mortality (Ps > 0.05). Moreover, the association between low albumin and all-cause mortality remained significant in the lower DPI subgroup (HR = 1.47, 95 % CI = 1.18-1.85), but was not significant in the high DPI subgroup (HR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 0.92-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: Serum albumin levels are inversely associated with all-cause mortality in community-based older adults at risk of sarcopenia. Sufficient dietary protein consumption may attenuate the effect of low serum albumin on increased mortality and potential mechanisms for the interaction warrant further exploration."

Musculoskeletal disorders in lower or upper limbs are not uncommon among patients with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

A total of 26 individuals suffering from non-insulin-dependent T2DM (age > 55 years old) participated in a 12 week nutritional intervention. The subjects were randomly assigned and the control group received 0.8-1.0 g protein/kg/day, while the intervention group received 1.2-1.5 g protein/kg/day. Lean body mass, muscle strength, and position sense were assessed at baseline, as well as at the 6th and 12th week of the intervention. Only in the intervention group, the essential amino acids intake met the current nutritional recommendations (p < 0.05), while, by the 12th week, only the intervention group showed significant improvement in the muscle strength of knee (p < 0.05) and shoulder (p < 0.05) extension. On the contrary, in the control group, a significant decline in appendicular lean mass (p < 0.05) was observed by the 12th week. Position sense at the knee joint revealed a tendency for improvement in the intervention group by the 12th week (main effect of time p = 0.072). In the present investigation, it was revealed that the higher protein intake in the intervention group seemed to have positive effects on muscle strength and nearly positive effects on position sense."

      "abstract": "Protein hydrolysate from black soldier fly larvae (BSFP) has garnered great attention with its lower allergenicity, high amount of essential amino acids, and small bioactive peptides. Schizochytrium is a promising alternative source of n-3 FUFA because it has enriched docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22: 6). The aim of this study was to assess palatability, the presence of diarrhea, plasma biochemistry panels, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, and immune function in beagle dogs when supplementing a mixture of protein hydrolysate from black soldier fly larvae and schizochytrium (BSFPs) into their diets. Experiment I: 24 young beagle dogs (16 males and 8 females; 4-5 months; BW: 6.40 ± 0.15 kg) were randomly divided into four groups: (1) control (CON), (2) 5% BSFPs, (3) 10% BSFPs, (4) 15% BSFPs. Their body weights and fecal scores were recorded, and blood samples were collected for analysis. Experiment II: three diets containing 5%, 10%, and 15% BSFPs were evaluated by comparing them with a basal diet (CON) to evaluate palatability. These results suggested that a lower presence of diarrhea existed in the BSFP diet than the CON diet (p < 0.05). Three treatment groups remarkably increased their total protein (TP) and albumin (ALB) contents and decreased their concentrations of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in plasma (p < 0.05). Moreover, the 5% and 15% BSFPs groups had a higher calcium (CA) content in plasma, and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and contents of creatinine (CREA) and urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly reduced by supplementing BSFP in their diets (p < 0.05). Their anti-oxidative enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were dramatically enhanced, and their malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were remarkably reduced (p < 0.05). Immunoglobulin A and G (IgA and IgG) concentrations in the plasma in the 10% and 15% BSFPs groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Furthermore, lower interleukin-8 (IL-8) contents were shown in the BSFP diets than the CON diet (p < 0.05). Similarly, the diets supplemented with BSFPs exhibited a positive effect on palatability (p < 0.05). To sum up, the diets supplemented with BSFPs significantly enhanced palatability, immune function, and anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory capacity to alleviate diarrhea and improve the general health of the beagle dogs."

      "abstract": "High crude protein (CP; 21% to 26%) diets fed during the first 21 to 28 d postweaning are viewed negatively because of a perceived increase in the incidence rates of diarrhea due to increased intestinal protein fermentation and/or augmented enteric pathogen burden. This is thought to antagonize nursery pig health and growth performance. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the impact of low vs. high dietary CP on 21-day postweaned pig intestinal function. Analyzed parameters included ex vivo intestinal barrier integrity (ileum and colon), ileal nutrient transport, tissue inflammation, and fecal DM. One hundred and twenty gilts and barrows (average body weight) were randomly assigned to one of two diets postweaning. Diets were fed for 21 d, in two phases. Phase 1 diets: low CP (17%) with a 1.4% standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys (LCP), or high CP (24%) with a 1.4% SID Lysine (HCP). Phase 2: LCP (17%) and a 1.35% SID lysine, or HCP (24%) formulated to a 1.35% SID lysine. Pig growth rates, feed intakes, and fecal consistency did not differ (P > 0.05) due to dietary treatment. Six animals per treatment were euthanized for additional analyses. There were no differences in colonic epithelial barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran transport between treatments (P > 0.05). Interleukins (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2 IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 were not different between treatments (P > 0.05). However, IL-8 and IL-18 were higher in HCP- vs. LCP-fed pigs (P < 0.05). There were no differences in fecal dry matter (DM; P > 0.05) between treatments. In the ileum, there was a tendency (P = 0.06) for TER to be higher in HCP-fed pigs, suggesting a more robust barrier. Interestingly, glucose and glutamine transport were decreased in HCP- vs. LCP-fed pigs (P < 0.05). FITC-dextran transport was not different between treatments (P > 0.05). There were also no differences in ileal cytokine concentrations between diets (P > 0.05). Taken together, the data show that low CP does not negatively impact colonic barrier function, fecal DM, or inflammation. In contrast, ileal barrier function and nutrient transport were altered, suggesting a regional effect of diet on overall intestinal function.",

      "abstract": "Genetically bred for rapid growth, broiler breeder hens develop obesity and ovarian dysfunction when fed ad libitum, resembling a condition that resembles human polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Nutritional control applies to post-hatched chicks from one week onward to prevent the development of a PCOS-like phenotype in adult broilers. This study investigated the impact of a growth marker, leptin, and post-hatch nutritional intake on early-life ovarian function. Fertile broiler eggs were injected in ovo with physiological saline solution or 5 µg of leptin and then incubated. After hatching, female chicks were fed ad libitum a diet containing low protein (17% low crude protein (LP)) or standard protein (22% standard crude protein (SP)). Tissues were collected from 7- and 28-day-old chicks for RT-qPCR and histological analysis. In contrast to the LP diet, the SP diet suppressed the mRNA expression of ovarian growth markers essential for folliculogenesis in post-hatched chicks. Leptin injection did not influence ovarian growth markers but increased pituitary gonadotropin transcripts in 7-day-old chicks fed with LP diet. No treatment effects on follicle activation were noted on day 7, but by day 28, in ovo leptin-treated LP-fed chicks exhibited a higher percentage of primary follicles. These changes may have resulted from the early upregulation of genes by leptin during the first week, including pituitary gonadotropins and ovarian leptin receptors. The decline in ovarian growth markers with the SP diet highlights the importance of precise post-hatch protein calculation, which may influence future ovarian function in animals. These findings may contribute to future dietary strategies to enhance broiler reproduction."

      "abstract": "The increasing cost of milk production, in association with tighter manure N application regulations and challenges associated with ammonia emissions in many countries, has increased interest in feeding lower crude protein (CP) diets based on legume silages. Most studies have focused on alfalfa silage, and little information is available on low-CP diets based on red clover silage. Our objectives were to examine the effects of dietary CP content and supplementing a low-CP diet with dietary starch or rumen-protected Met (RPMet) on the performance, metabolism, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE; milk N output/N intake) in dairy cows fed a red clover and grass silage-based diet. A total of 56 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were blocked and randomly allocated to 1 of 4 diets over a 14-wk feeding period. Diets were based on red clover and grass silages at a ratio of 50:50 on a dry matter (DM) basis and were fed as a total mixed ration, with a 53:47 ratio of forage to concentrate (DM basis). The diets were formulated to supply a similar metabolizable protein (MP) content, and had a CP concentration of either 175 g/kg DM (control [CON]) or 150 g/kg DM (low-protein [LP]), or LP supplemented with either additional barley as a source of starch (LPSt; +64 g/kg DM) or RPMet (LPM; +0.3 g/100 g MP). At the end of the 14-wk feeding period, 20 cows (5 per treatment) continued to be fed the same diets for a further 6 d, and total urine output and fecal samples were collected. We observed that dietary treatment did not affect DM intake, with a mean of 21.5 kg/d; however, we also observed an interaction between diet and week with intake being highest in cows fed LPSt in wk 4 and CON in wk 9 and 14. Mean milk yield, 4% fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk were not altered by treatment. Similarly, we found no effect of dietary treatment on milk fat, protein, or lactose content. In contrast, milk and plasma urea concentrations were highest in cows fed CON. The concentration of blood plasma β-hydroxybutyrate was highest in cows receiving LPM and lowest in LPSt. Apparent NUE was 28.6% in cows fed CON and was higher in cows fed any of the low-protein diets (LP, LPSt, or LPM), with a mean value of 34.2%. The sum of milk fatty acids with a chain length below C16:0 was also highest in cows fed CON. We observed that dietary treatment did not affect the apparent whole-tract nutrient digestibility of organic matter, N, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber, with mean values of 0.785, 0.659, 0.660, and 0.651 kg/kg respectively, but urinary N excretion was approximately 60 g/d lower in cows fed the low-CP diets compared with CON. We conclude that reducing the CP content of red clover and grass silage-based diets from 175 to 150 g/kg DM while maintaining MP supply did not affect performance, but reduced the urinary N excretion and improved NUE, and that supplementing additional starch or RPMet had little further effect.",

      "abstract": "The hybrid grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatus) is a new species of grouper crossed from giant grouper (E. lanceolatus) as the male parent and brown-marbled grouper (E. fuscoguttatus) as the female parent. We hypothesized that optimal levels of dietary protein may benefit liver function. High-lipid diets are energetic feeds that conserve protein and reduce costs, and are a hot topic in aquaculture today. Therefore, the objective of the research is to investigated the effects of dietary protein level in high-lipid diets on serum and liver biochemistry, liver histology, and liver immune and antioxidant indexes and gene mRNA expression of the juvenile hybrid grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatus). Six iso-lipidic (161 g/kg) diets were formulated containing graded levels of protein (510 as control, 480,450, 420, 390 and 360 g/kg). Each treatment consisted of three replicates and 30 fish (6.70 ± 0.02 g) in one replicate. After an 8-week feeding experiment, the results indicated the following: (1) With the decreasing of dietary protein level, the specific growth rate (SGR) of groupers increased gradually and then decreased; SGRs of the 390 and 360 g/kg groups were significantly lower than other groups (p < 0.05). (2) In terms of serum and liver, the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) content, and the activity of immune enzymes such as lysozyme (LYS) and immunoglobulin (IgM) was significantly increased under the appropriate protein level. (3) Based on liver histology, we know that high or low dietary protein levels cause liver damage. (4) Dietary protein levels can significantly affect the mRNA expression levels of an anti-inflammatory factor gene (tgfβ), pro-inflammatory factor genes (il6, il8), heat shock proteins, and antioxidant and immune genes (hsp70 and hsp90, gpx, nrf2, keap1). It is concluded that the appropriate protein level can promote the growth performance of groupers, improve antioxidant activity and immune enzyme activity in serum and liver, and enhance the expression of immune genes."

This study investigated whether co-ingestion of dietary protein and TBBQ can alleviate the toxicity of TBBQ. The results indicated that soy protein isolate, whey protein isolate, and rice protein significantly reduced the residual amount of TBBQ during simulated gastrointestinal digestion. This result was attributed to the excellent elimination capacity of the released amino acids for TBBQ through formation of adducts. Among 20 amino acids, histidine, lysine, glycine, and cysteine showed better elimination capacity for TBBQ; they can eliminate 92.1%, 89.4%, 86.1%, and almost 100%, respectively, in 5 min at pH 8.0. Further study indicated that amino acids with lower ionization constant exhibited greater TBBQ elimination capacity. In addition, incubation of the cells with 50 μM TBBQ for 12 h decreased the cell viability to 28.95 ± 3.25%; while amino acids intervention was involved in the alleviation of TBBQ cytotoxicity via decreasing ROS. Particularly, cysteine showed 100 times more TBBQ detoxifying capacity than other amino acids. This work could provide a theoretical basis for the potential application of amino acids for detoxifying TBBQ in the food industry.",

      "abstract": "Guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), although native to Africa and despite its many potentials, does not represent the dominant species on the continent because of its seasonal reproductive nature and high keets mortality. This study was conducted to assess the effect of crude protein levels on growth performance, bone characteristics and reproductive activity of Pearl Gray male breeder guinea fowl from 12 to 26 wk of age. A total of 120 twelve-wk-old guinea fowls were randomly allotted to 3 dietary treatments with 8 replicates each and 5 birds per replicate using a completely randomized design. The dietary treatments comprised low level (LL), normal level (NL), and high level (HL) with diets respectively containing 15, 17, and 19% crude protein (CP). The results showed that guinea fowl in the HL treatment had a significantly lower feed conversion ratio (P = 0.008) than those in the other treatments. The birds fed the HL diet had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone (P < 0.05) than in the other treatments. High levels of calcium and phosphorus were observed in the femur of the HL group relative to the LL group. The birds in the LL treatment had a significantly higher (P = 0.007) femur robusticity index than those in the HL treatment. In conclusion, feeding 19% crude protein to Pearl Gray male guinea fowl from 12 to 26 wk of age improves growth performance, the density and strength of the femur and tibia and the reproductive tract. The CP level for the best performance of male guinea fowl from 12 to 26 wk of age is 19%.",

      "abstract": "Low crude protein (CP) diets might be fed to dairy cows without affecting productivity if the balance of absorbed AA were improved, which would decrease the environmental effect of dairy farms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementing ruminally protected Lys (RPL) and Met (RPM) at 2 levels of dietary CP on nutrient intake, milk production, milk composition, milk N efficiency (MNE), and plasma concentrations of AA in lactating Holstein cows and to evaluate these effects against the predictions of the new NASEM (2021) model. Fifteen multiparous cows were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 21-d periods. The 3 treatments were (1) a high-protein (HP) basal diet containing 16.4% CP (metabolizable protein [MP] balance of -130 g/d; 95% of target values), (2) a medium-protein diet containing 15% CP plus RPL (60 g/cow per day) and RPM (25 g/cow per day; MPLM; MP balance of -314 g/d; 87% of target values), and (3) a low-protein diet containing 13.6% CP plus RPL (60 g/cow per day) and RPM (25 g/cow per day; LPLM; MP balance of -479 g/d; 80% of target values). Dry matter intake was less for cows fed MPLM and LPLM diets compared with those fed the HP diet. Compared with the HP diet, the intake of CP, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and organic matter, but not starch, was lower for cows fed MPLM and LPLM diets. Milk production and composition were not affected by MPLM or LPLM diets relative to the HP diet. Milk urea N concentrations were reduced for the MPLM and LPLM diets compared with the HP diet, indicating that providing a low-protein diet supplemented with rumen-protected AA led to greater N efficiency. There was no significant effect of treatment on plasma AA concentrations except for proline, which significantly increased for the MPLM treatment compared with the other 2 treatments. Overall, the results supported the concept that milk performance might be maintained when feeding lactating dairy cows with low CP diets if the absorbed AA balance is maintained through RPL and RPM feeding. Further investigations are needed to evaluate responses over a longer time period with consideration of all AA rather than on the more aggregated MP and the ratio between Lys and Met.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary l-leucine or its metabolite 𝛽-hydroxy-𝛽-methylbutyrate (HMB) has a crucial role in the muscle protein metabolism of broilers during the first few-week growing period. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of l-leucine (LLPD) or HMB (HLPD) supplementation in a low-protein diet (20%, LPD) until 21 days old on performance, carcass weight, muscle yield and meat quality, as well as intestinal morphometry, in broiler chickens. RESULTS: From days 1-42, LPD decreased body weight gain and feed intake (FI) and increased feed conversion ratio compared to a standard protein diet (22%, SPD). The LLPD and HLPD did not affect FI, but the LLPD decreased the body weight gain and increased the feed conversion ratio compared to the SPD. The LPD group had lower body and muscle weights than other groups. Compared to LPD, HLPD increased dressing percentage. The LPD decreased the serum insulin-like growth factor-1 content compared to the SPD and LLPD. The duodenal villus height of the LPD and LLPD broilers was smaller than those of the SPD and HLPD birds. The HLPD broilers had lower duodenal villus width than the SPD birds. The duodenal crypt depth and ileal mucosal thickness were higher in the HLPD group than in other groups. The HLPD and LLPD enhanced the ileal villus height compared to the SPD. The LLPD and HLPD treatments did not affect meat quality traits compared to the SPD treatment. CONCLUSION: Dietary HMB could be a conducive approach to reducing dietary protein for broilers until 21 days old. © 2023 The Authors.

      "abstract": "It is estimated that about 50% of geriatric rehabilitation patients suffer from sarcopenia. Thereby, malnutrition is frequently associated with sarcopenia, and dietary intake is the main modifiable risk factor. During hospitalization, older adults are recommended to consume more dietary protein than the current recommended dietary allowance of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day to optimize the recovery of muscular strength and physical function. This prospective pilot study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of short-term protein supplementation with protein-enriched foods and drinks on the hand-grip strength, nutritional status, and physical function of older patients at risk of malnutrition during a three-week inpatient orthopedic rehabilitation stay. The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) tool was used to assess malnutrition. Patients with an MNA score ≤ 23.5 points were randomly assigned to an intervention group (goal: to consume 1.2-1.5 g protein/kg body weight per day) or a control group (standard care). Both groups carried out the same rehabilitation program. Physical recovery parameters were determined at admission and discharge. A trend was recognized for participants in the intervention group to consume more protein than the control group (p = 0.058): 95.3 (SD 13.2) g/day as compared to 77.2 (SD 24.2) g/day, which corresponds to a mean protein intake of 1.6 (SD 0.3) g/kg/day vs. 1.3 (SD 0.5) g/kg/day. Dietary protein supplementation increased body weight by an average of 0.9 (SD 1.1) kg and fat mass by an average of 0.9 (SD 1.2) kg as compared to the baseline (p = 0.039 and p = 0.050, respectively). No significant change in hand-grip strength, body composition, or physical function was observed. In conclusion, short-term intervention with protein-enriched foods and drinks enabled older patients at risk of malnutrition to increase their protein intake to levels that are higher than their required intake. In these older individuals with appropriate protein intake, dietary protein supplementation did not result in a greater improvement in physical recovery outcomes during short-term inpatient rehabilitation. The intervention improved dietary protein intake, but further research (e.g., a full-scale, randomized, controlled trial with sufficient power) is required to determine the effects on physical function outcomes."

The objective of this study was to see how changes in dietary protein levels affect milk yield, body weight gain, blood biochemical parameters, and gut microbiota in lactating ewes. In a completely randomized design, eighteen ewes were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 6 ewes/group), and each group was assigned to one of three dietary treatments with different protein contents. The ewes' groups were fed on 8.38% (S-I), 10.42% (S-m), and 13.93% (S-h) dietary protein levels on a dry basis. The body weight gain and milk yield were greater (p < 0.05) in ewes fed the S-h dietary treatment than in those fed the S-m and S-1 diets, respectively. However, milk protein contents were similar (p > 0.05) across the treatments. The blood glucose, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, lactate, creatinine, and C-reactive protein contents of lactating ewes were not influenced (p > 0.05) by different dietary protein levels. The alanine transaminase, aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase activities were also not changed (p > 0.05) across the groups. However, blood urea nitrogen and albumin contents of lactating ewes were changed (p < 0.05) with increasing levels of dietary protein, and these metabolite concentrations were higher (p < 0.05) for S-h than the rest of the treatments. In the different treatment groups, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were found to be the most dominant phyla. However, the abundance of Lachnospiraceae species decreased as dietary protein levels increased. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Rikenellaceae were more abundant, followed by Prevotellaceae, in ewes fed the S-m diet compared to those fed the other diets. Based on the results, feeding at an optimal protein level improved milk yield and body weight gain through modifying the digestive tract's beneficial bacterial communities. The results of blood metabolites suggested that feeding higher-protein diets has no negative impact on health."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dietary protein levels on flesh quality, oxidative stress, and autophagy status in the muscles of triploid crucian carp (Carassius carassius triploid), and the related molecular mechanisms. Six experimental diets with different protein levels (26%, 29%, 32%, 35%, 38%, 41%) were formulated. A total of 540 fish with an initial weight of 11.79 ± 0.09 g were randomly assigned to 18 cages and six treatments with three replicates of 30 fish each for 8 weeks feeding. It could be found that the whole-body ash content significantly increased in high protein level groups (p < 0.05). The 29% dietary protein level group exhibited the highest muscle moisture, although there was an inconspicuous decrease in the chewiness of the muscles when compared with the other groups. The dietary protein level influenced the content of free amino acids and nucleotides, especially the content of flavor amino acids, which exhibited an increasing tendency along with the increasing protein level, such as alanine and glutamic acid, while the flavor nucleotides showed different fluctuation trends. Moreover, the genes related to muscle development were shown to be influenced by the dietary protein level, especially the expression of MRF4, which was up-regulated with the increasing dietary protein levels. The 29% dietary protein level promoted the majority of analyzed muscle genes expression to the highest level when compared to other dietary levels, except the Myostain, whose expression reached its highest at 38% dietary protein levels. Furthermore, the effect of dietary protein levels on antioxidant signaling pathway genes were also examined. High protein levels would boost the expression of GSTα; GPX1 and GPX4α mRNA expression showed the highest level at the 32% dietary protein group. The increasing dietary protein level decreased both mRNA and protein expressions of Nrf2 by up-regulating Keap1. Autophagy-related gene expression levels reached the peak at 32% dietary protein level, as evidenced by a similar change in protein expression of FoxO1. In summary, muscle nutritional composition, antioxidative pathways, and autophagy levels were affected by the dietary protein levels. A total of 29-32% dietary protein level would be the appropriate level range to improve muscle quality and promote the antioxidant and autophagy capacity of triploid crucian carp muscles."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Protein malnutrition is associated with higher risks of postoperative complications, mortality, prolonged postoperative stays in hospital, slower physical and mental recovery after surgery and lower subsequent health-related quality of life. To reduce the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality, nutritional prehabilitation programmes have been developed recently to build up patient's nutritional reserve to withstand the stress of surgery. The intervention involves nutritional screening and counselling, and increasing dietary protein intake in protein-malnourished patients in the several weeks before surgery. However, there are few well-conducted preoperative studies to examine the effect of increasing dietary protein intake on the quality of recovery of malnourished patients after elective cardiac surgery. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled trial of malnourished patients undergoing major elective cardiac surgery will compare the quality of postoperative recovery in patients with or without nutritional prehabilitation. One hundred and thirty-two patients will be randomised to receive nutritional prehabilitation (target-adjusted whey protein powder supplementation and an individualised 1 hour session/week counselling by a dietician 1 month before operation date) or standard care (no nutritional prehabilitation). Primary outcomes will be the quality of recovery after surgery (15-item Quality of Recovery) on the third postoperative day. Secondary outcomes will include days (alive and) at home within 30 days, changes in the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, changes in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) and Cardiac Postoperative Morbidity Survey. An outcomes assessor will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Appropriate univariate analyses, generalised estimating equations and multiple regressions will be performed for intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Joint CUHK-NTEC Clinical Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (CREC Ref. No.: 2021.703 T). The findings will be presented at scientific meetings, peer-reviewed journals and to study participants. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2200057463.",

The study was an open-label, exploratory, randomized controlled trial conducted at seven hospitals in Japan. The study participants were adults aged 75 or older who were hospitalized for treatable cancer, pneumonia, fractures, and/or urinary-tract infection at nutritional risk. The primary outcome was change in grip strength, skeletal muscle, and ADL indices (Barthel index, Lawton score). One hundred sixty-nine patients were randomly assigned to the intensive care (IC) or standard care (SC) group; the protein intake goals (g/kgw/day) were 1.5 for IC and 1.0 for SC. There was a significant improvement in grip strength only in the IC group (1.1 kg: 95% CI 0.1 to 2.1) (p = 0.02). While the skeletal muscle index and ADL indices were not significantly improved in either group, the improvement ratio tended to be greater in the IC group. There was no decrease in renal function in either group. Thus, intervention of increased dietary protein in daily-life settings for 6 months in adults aged 75 or older with treatable cancer, pneumonia, fractures, and/or urinary-tract infection and at nutritional risk may be effective in ameliorating loss of muscle strength.",

      "abstract": "Administration of levodopa for Parkinson's disease (PD) has remained the most effective therapy for symptom management despite being in use for over 50 years. Advancing disease and age, changing tolerability and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction may result in change in dietary habits and body weight, as well as unpredictable motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Dietary proteins which convert into amino acids after digestion are implicated as major factors that inhibit levodopa absorption. For people living with PD (PwP) who experience motor fluctuations, low protein diets (LPD) and protein redistribution diets (PRD) may be effective and are often recommended as a non-pharmacologic approach for improving levodopa bioavailability. However, there is a lack of consensus on a standard definition of these diets and appropriate treatment algorithms for usage. This may be due to the paucity of high-level evidence of LPD and PRD in PwP and whether all or specific subgroups of patients would benefit from these strategies. Managing diet and protein intake with proper education and monitoring may reduce complications associated with these diets such as dyskinesias and unintentional weight loss. Additionally, alterations to medications and GI function may alter levodopa pharmacokinetics. In this narrative review we focus on 1) mechanisms of dietary protein and levodopa absorption in the intestine and blood brain barrier, 2) dietetic approaches to manage protein and levodopa interactions and 3) practical issues for treating PwP as well as future directions to be considered."

We focus on phenylacetylglutamine [PAGln], a diet-derived meta-organismal prothrombotic metabolite. DESIGN: We collected faecal and serum samples from a CD cohort [n = 136] and healthy controls [n = 126] prior to treatment, and quantified serum PAGln using LC-MS/MS. Diet was assessed using food-frequency questionnaires. Mice [C57BL/6] were fed high/low-protein diets and administered dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] to examine plasma PAGly, thrombosis potential, and colitis severity. PAGly or saline was administered to DSS-induced colitis mice, and colitis severity and colonic tissue gene expression were examined. P-selectin and CD40L expression were determined in human platelet-rich plasma [n = 5-6] after exposure to platelet agonists following PAGln priming. Bioinformatic analysis and bacterial culturing identified the main contributor of PAGln in CD. RESULTS: PAGln, a meta-organismal prothrombotic metabolite, is associated with CD. Administration of PAGly exacerbated colitis in a mouse model and upregulated coagulation-related biological processes. Antiplatelet medicine, dipyridamole, attenuated PAGly-enhanced colitis susceptibility. PAGln enhanced platelet activation and CD40L expression in platelet-rich plasma ex vivo. Further study revealed that high dietary protein intake and increased abundance of phenylacetic acid [PAA]-producing Proteobacteria mediated by phenylpyruvate decarboxylase act in concert to cause the elevated PAGln levels in CD patients. CONCLUSION: Taken together, ppdc-carrying Proteobacteria-generated PAGln from dietary protein is associated with CD and exacerbates colitis possibly via platelet-induced coagulation and inflammation These results suggest that PAGln is a potential early diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of CD.",

They also indicate the need for information to address health-related issues, including nutritional problems, of their family members with dementia (FMWD). This study examined the impact of coaching to improve family caregiver (FCG) stress and well-being and to increase the protein intake of both FCGs and their FMWD. All participants received nutrition education including a protein prescription (1.2 g/kg body weight/day) and FCGs received stress-reduction materials. Coached-group randomized participants also received weekly diet coaching and stress-reduction coaching. At baseline and 8 weeks, anthropometrics, a mini-nutritional assessment questionnaire, and diet (protein intake) were assessed in FCGs and FMWD; well-being, fatigue and strain were assessed in FCGs. Repeated two words measures analysis of variance and Fisher's exact tests examined within group and intervention effects. Twenty-five FCGs (13 coached group, 12 not-coached group) and 23 FMWD (12 coached group, 11 not-coached group) completed the study. No significant differences were found between coached and not-coached FCGs and FMWD at baseline. After 8- weeks, FCGs' protein intake significantly increased from 1.00 ± 0.17 to 1.35 ± 0.23 g/kg/body weight in the coached group and from 0.91 ± 0.19 to 1.01 ± 0.33 g/kg/body weight in the not-coached group; there was also an intervention effect (p=.01, η2 = .24). The percentage of FCGs with baseline protein intake less than prescription guidelines and with an end-of-study protein intake meeting/exceeding the prescription significantly differed, with 60% of coached FCGs versus 10% of not coached FCGs meeting the prescription. No intervention effects were shown for protein intake in FMWD or for well-being, fatigue or strain among FCGs. Diet coaching with nutrition education successfully assisted FCGs with improving their protein intake versus nutrition education alone.",

      "abstract": "Reducing the dependency on soybean meal (SBM) is necessary to improve the sustainability of the poultry industry. Moreover, the recommendations for minimum contents of dietary Gly+Ser require further research. Two parallel studies were executed to determine the effects of replacing SBM with crystalline amino acids (CAA) to meet the amino acid requirements and to determine whether a minimum content of Gly+Ser is necessary for broiler diets. In study 1, 1,860 one-day-old male chicks were fed a common starter phase diet (22.8% CP). During the grower-1, grower-2, and finisher phases, the control CP content was reduced (up to 2.1%) with the stepwise addition of CAA (treatments 1-5). Within each feeding phase, AME, standardized ileal digestible Lys, and the minimum Met, Thr, Val, Gly+Ser, Ile, Arg, and Trp to Lys ratios were similar. In study 2, 1,488 male chickens were used in a 2 × 2 factorial design with the Gly+Ser content and feed ingredients used as main factors. Performance was monitored during 41 d in both studies. Reduction in CP content linearly increased (P < 0.05) BW, ADG, and ADFI in the grower-1, grower-2, and finisher phases. When the overall FCR was adjusted considering the BW differences (FCRadj); FCRadj linearly decreased with the weighted average CP (WACP) content (P < 0.001). In the lowest CP treatment, estimated dietary N utilization efficiency was improved by 10%, and the overall N excretion was reduced by 16% compared with the control (P < 0.001). The overall SBM and soybean oil intakes were linearly reduced relative to WACP (-12.0 and -20.2% in control vs. treatment 5, respectively; P < 0.001). Formulating with a minimum Gly+Ser content in the starter phase improved the FCR (P < 0.05) only in the corn-SBM-based diet. In grower-1, increasing Gly+Ser content improved the FCR independent of the feed ingredients used (P < 0.05). Crystalline amino acids can be used to partially replace intact protein reducing the dependency on SBM. Young birds may not synthesize enough Gly endogenously and a minimum content should be provided in the early phases.",

A total of two hundred and ten day-old Aseel chickens were randomly allotted to seven dietary treatment groups. Each group had thirty chicks distributed into three replicates of ten chicks in each. Experimental diets were formulated to have varying levels of CP, viz. 18.5, 19.0, 19.5, 20.0, 20.5, 21.0, and 21.5%, with isocaloric energy of 2800 kcal ME/kg diets of mash feed fed to birds in a completely randomized design. Different CP levels had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on the body weight gain (BWG) of Aseel chicken. At the end of 16 weeks of age, the group fed 21% CP gained 223.53 g more than the lowest CP (18.5%)-fed group. The different CP levels did not significantly (P > 0.05) influenced the feed intake of all treatment groups, but numerically highest feed intake was observed in the lowest CP (18.5%)-fed group. However, significant differences in feed efficiency (FE) appeared from the 13th week only with the 21.0% CP-fed group showing the best FE until the 16th week (3.86 to 4.06). The maximum dressing % (70.61) was observed by the 21% CP-fed group. The CP 21% diet down-regulated the MSTN gene expression in breast muscle tissue to 0.07 folds when compared to the diet of CP 20%. The best economical coordinates for maximum performance for Aseel chicken appeared to be CP of 21% and ME of 2800 kcal/kg to achieve the best FE of 3.86 at the earliest age of 13 weeks. In conclusion, 21% CP in an isocaloric diet of 2800 kcal ME/kg, in Aseel chickens, would be optimum to improve the growth performance at maximum in terms of BWG and FE up to 16 weeks of age.",

METHODS: An exploratory analysis of choline and protein intake from 3-d diet records and measures of 36 serum choline and carnitine metabolites in early (12-17 wk) and late (36-38 wk) pregnancy was conducted in participants from the Be Healthy in Pregnancy study randomized to high dairy protein+walking exercise or usual care. Metabolites were measured in fasted maternal and cord serum using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Mixed ANOVA adjusted for body mass index was performed for comparison of metabolites across pregnancy and between intervention and control. RESULTS: In 104 participants, the median (Q1, Q3) total choline intake was 347 (263, 427) mg/d in early and 322 (270, 437) mg/d in late pregnancy. Only ∼20% of participants achieved the recommended adequate intake (450 mg/d) and ∼10% consumed supplemental choline (8-200 mg/d). Serum-free choline (μmol/L) was higher in late compared with early pregnancy [12.9 (11.4, 15.1) compared with 9.68 (8.25, 10.61), P < 0.001], but choline downstream metabolites were similar across pregnancy. Serum carnitine [10.3 (9.01, 12.2) compared with 15.9 (14.1, 17.9) μmol/L, P < 0.001] and acetylcarnitine [2.35 (1.92, 2.68) compared with 3.0 (2.56, 3.59), P < 0.001] were significantly lower in late pregnancy. High cord:maternal serum metabolite ratios were found in most measured metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Despite inadequate choline intake, serum-free choline was elevated in late pregnancy and enriched in cord blood compared with maternal serum. Serum carnitine declined in late pregnancy despite a high protein diet. The higher cord:maternal concentrations in choline and carnitine metabolites suggest active uptake in late pregnancy, reflecting the importance of these circulating metabolites in fetal development. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01689961.",

      "abstract": "This study is aimed at the effects of low-protein diets with four amino acids balanced on serum biochemical parameters and colonic microflora of finishing pigs. Fifty-four healthy (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) hybrid barrows with an average body weight of 70.12 ± 4.03 kg were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments with three barrows per pen and six pens per treatment. The barrows were fed a normal protein diet (NP), a low-protein diet (LP), and a very low-protein diet (VLP). Compared with the NP diet, reduced dietary protein did not influence serum biochemical parameters (p > 0.05). The valeric acid was significantly increased with the VLP diet (p < 0.05). Compared with the NP diets, the abundance of Terrisporobacter (13.37%) Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (23.37%) and Turicibacter (2.57%) increased to 21.04, 33.42 and 13.68% in LP diets and 16.72, 43.71 and 14.61% in VLP diets, while the abundance of Lactobacillus (9.30%) and Streptococcus (25.26%) decreased to 3.57 and 14.50% in LP diets and 1.86 and 4.07% in VLP diets. Turicibacter and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_6 had a powerful negative correlation with the content of valeric acid (p < 0.01), while Peptococcus and Clostridia_UCG-014 had a very solid positive correlation (p < 0.01). In conclusion, reducing dietary protein level can improve colon microbiota composition, especially reducing the abundance of bacteria related to nitrogen metabolism, but has no significant effect on SCFA except valeric acid. In addition, reduction in the dietary protein level by 5.48% had more different flora than that of 2.74% reduction in dietary CP level."

      "abstract": "Various studies with growing ruminants report increases in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) when feeding oscillating (OS) dietary CP, whereas limited research with lactating dairy cows demonstrates a lack of improvement in NUE when feeding OS diets. We hypothesised that a total mixed ration (TMR) delivering OS CP (48-h phases of 134 and 171 g CP/kg DM, respectively) compared to a static CP TMR (ST; 152 g CP/kg DM) would result in similar or increased urinary purine derivative excretion (as a marker of microbial protein synthesis (MPS)) and greater urinary nitrogen excretion in lactating dairy cows. Responses in intake, production, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD), nutrient balance, and estimated MPS were evaluated using faecal and urine collection in 12 multiparous cows (172 ± 39 d in milk) in a randomised complete block design, where total urinary output was estimated indirectly. All measurements were taken during d 8 (at 1700) to d 16 (at 1700) of the 16-d study that followed a 28-d period in which cows already received their respective treatments. Dry matter intake, yields of milk, protein, fat, lactose, and fat- and protein-corrected milk were similar for ST and OS. Milk composition, BW, and body condition score also did not differ between treatments, except for a tendency for increased milk urea concentration with OS (13.7 vs 12.4 mg/dL). Feed efficiency, NUE and ATTD of organic matter, NDF, CP and gross energy did not differ, but ATTD of crude fat (658 vs 627 g/kg) and starch (980 vs 975 g/kg) increased, and ATTD of DM (702 vs 691 g/kg) tended to increase with OS. Milk energy as a proportion of digested energy tended to decrease with OS (34.6 vs 37.1%), but other energy metabolism variables were not affected by treatment. Estimated urinary nitrogen excretion increased (165 vs 144 g/d), estimated urinary nitrogen as a proportion of nitrogen intake tended to increase (25.3 vs 22.7%), and milk nitrogen as a proportion of digested nitrogen decreased (47.3 vs 51.8%) in response to OS. Estimated urinary excretion of creatinine (184 vs 165 mmol/d), uric acid (29 vs 20 mmol/d) and urea (3.1 vs 2.5 mol/d) increased, but other nitrogen metabolism parameters were not affected by OS. Overall, oscillating dietary CP content did not affect lactational performance, milk NUE, or estimated MPS. However, ATTD of some nutrients increased, postabsorptive energy use for milk synthesis tended to decrease, and estimated urinary nitrogen losses increased with OS.",

This literature review summarizes the impact of protein intake and supplementation on the indicators of severe sarcopenia-muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function in community-dwelling older adults. We performed a literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and MedLine, and included studies that evaluated the effects of protein intake with or without exercise intervention and on sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. Information regarding study participants, protein intervention, and sarcopenia-related outcomes were collected. Protein supplementation with or without exercise positively improves muscle mass, and aspects of muscle strength and physical function in sarcopenic and pre-frail older adults, while it elicited inconclusive effects in healthy populations. Greater dietary animal-based and soy-based protein diets can improve muscle mass in older adults. In conclusion, protein supplementation can improve muscle mass and reduce the risk of sarcopenia in sarcopenia and pre-frail older adults, while future studies should continue to investigate the effects of protein supplementation on indicators of sarcopenia in healthy older adults."

      "abstract": "In the protein nutrition strategy of middle-aged and elderly people, some believe that low protein is good for health, while others believe high protein is good for health. Facing the contradictory situation, the following hypothesis is proposed. There is a process of change from lower to higher ratio of protein nutritional requirements that are good for health in the human body after about 50 years of age, and the age at which the switch occurs is around 65 years of age. Hence, in this study, 50, 25-month-old male rats were randomly divided into five groups: Control (basal diet), LP (low-protein diet with a 30% decrease in protein content compared to the basal diet), HP (high-protein diet with a 30% increase in protein content compared to the basal diet), Model 1 (switched from LP to HP feed at week 4), and Model 2 (switched from LP to HP feed at week 7). After a total of 10 weeks intervention, the liver and serum samples were examined for aging-related indicators, and a newly comprehensive quantitative score was generated using principal component analysis (PCA). The effects of the five protein nutritional modalities were quantified in descending order: Model 1 > HP > LP > Control > Model 2. Furthermore, the differential metabolites in serum and feces were determined by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and 15 differential metabolites, significantly associated with protein intake, were identified by Spearman's correlation analysis (p < 0.05). Among the fecal metabolites, 10 were positively correlated and 3 were negatively correlated. In the serum, tyrosine and lactate levels were positively correlated, and acetate levels were negatively correlated. MetaboAnalyst analysis identified that the metabolic pathways influenced by protein intake were mainly related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. The results of metabolomic analysis elucidate the mechanisms underlying the preceding effects to some degree. These efforts not only contribute to a unified protein nutrition strategy but also positively impact the building of a wiser approach to protein nutrition, thereby helping middle-aged and older populations achieve healthy aging."

      "abstract": "The pullet phase is an important stage in the development of laying hens when the development of organs, including reproductive organs and bones, is rapid. However, in recent years, few studies have focused on this crucial stage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a dietary crude protein (CP) regimen during the rearing period (9-21 weeks (wks) of age) on pullet development and the subsequent performance, egg quality, and bone quality of Hy-Line Brown laying hens. A total of 256 pullets were randomly assigned to two treatments. Each treatment was replicated eight times with 16 pullets per replicate (n=8), which were fed ad libitum using either of the two CP regimens: (1) 14%-18% CP (fed with 14% and 18% CP from 9-17 wks and 18-21 wks, respectively); (2) 16% CP (fed with 16% CP from 9-21 wks of age). At 21 wks of age, eight birds per treatment were randomly selected to evaluate body composition and ovarian development. For quality analysis, eggs were collected at 28, 32, 36, and 70 wks. At 70 wks of age, eight hens per treatment were selected to evaluate bone quality. There were no treatment differences in pullet performance, body composition, and ovarian development at 21 wks. The dietary CP regimen during the rearing period (9-21 wks) did not influence laying performance during the laying period. There were no treatment differences in tibial and femoral quality at 70 wks. Egg quality results showed an inconsistent trend. It was concluded that the pullets fed with the low CP grower diet (14%) during the pullet period and a high CP pre-lay diet (18%) from 18-21 wks of age developed properly and had satisfactory laying performance. However, the rearing diet did not enhance bone quality."

METHODS: This study analyzed 744 adults with overweight/obesity within the DIOGenes project. Patients who lost at least 8% of their initial weight (0-8 weeks) after a low-calorie diet (LCD) were randomly assigned to one of five ad libitum diets designed for weight maintenance (8-34 weeks): high/low protein (HP/LP) and high/low glycemic index (HGI/LGI), plus a control. The complete nutritional program (0-34 weeks) included both LCD plus the randomized diets intervention. The TyG index was tested as marker of body mass composition and insulin resistance. RESULTS: In comparison with the LP/HGI diet, the HP/LGI diet induced a greater BMI loss (p < 0.05). ∆TyG was positively associated with resistance to BMI loss (β = 0.343, p = 0.042) during the weight maintenance stage. In patients who followed the HP/LGI diet, TyG (after LCD) correlated with greater BMI loss in the 8-34 weeks period (r = -0.256; p < 0.05) and during the 0-34 weeks intervention (r = -0.222, p < 0.05) periods. ΔTyG1 value was associated with ΔBMI2 (β = 0.932; p = 0.045) concerning the HP/LGI diet. CONCLUSIONS: A HP/LGI diet is beneficial not only for weight maintenance after a LCD, but is also related to IR amelioration as assessed by TyG index changes.

A total of 144 weaned pigs (6.35 ± 0.63 kg body weight) were assigned to 6 treatments in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement based on CP content and sanitary conditions using a randomized complete block design, giving 8 replicates per treatment with 3 pigs per pen. Pigs were fed one of three diets for 21 d: one high CP (HCP; 22%) and two low CP (LCP; 19%) diets supplemented with 9 indispensable AA or only 6 AA (Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, Val, and Ile) as CAA. The CSC room was washed weekly, whereas the USC room had sow manure spread in the pens and was not washed throughout the experiment. Body weight and feed disappearance were recorded weekly. Blood was sampled from 1 pig per pen weekly, and the same pig was euthanized for jejunal tissues sampling on day 21. Pigs raised under USC had reduced (P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) in week 2, but contrary results that greater (P < 0.05) ADG and G:F were found in pigs under USC in week 3. Overall, there was an interaction where G:F did not differ between HCP and LCP under CSC, however, LCP decreased (P < 0.05) G:F compared to HCP under USC. Pigs fed the HCP diet had higher (P < 0.05) fecal scores than those fed the LCP diets throughout the experiment. Pigs fed the LCP had higher (P < 0.05) villus height to crypt depth ratio than those fed the HCP. An interaction was observed where goblet cell density in the jejunum was higher (P < 0.05) in pigs fed LCP than HCP under CSC, but no difference was found between HCP and LCP under USC. Different CAA supplementation patterns did not influence both growth performance and histomorphology. Pigs raised under USC had greater (P < 0.05) plasma interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6 concentrations and reduced (P < 0.05) plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration. Also, the LCP diets resulted in a greater (P < 0.05) plasma IL-10 concentration. In conclusion, overall growth performance did not differ between HCP and LCP under CSC, but LCP diets reduced G:F under USC. Feeding LCP diets to weaned pigs improved gut morphology under USC and ameliorated systemic inflammation induced by USC, whereas CAA supplementation patterns did not affect growth performance and gut morphology.",

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to systematically assess and compare the fluctuations in crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), and mineral content of staged (larva to adult) Drosophila (fruit fly) to that of a market-purchased black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) product. Results suggested that the relative CP content by dry matter ranged from 40.11% to 53.73% during Drosophila development, significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the 36.90% in BSFL. The relative CF was higher in BSFL (39.14%) compared to that of Drosophila (27.03-30.10%, P < 0.001). Although both insects contained sufficient levels of minerals to meet the dietary requirements of most animals, Drosophila overall possessed a lower content of iron, sodium, and calcium (P < 0.001) with a higher gross energy than the BSFL (P < 0.01). Comparative studies of amino acid (AA) and fatty acid (FA) profiles were further carried out among Drosophila larva (DL), pupa, and BSFL for their economic effectiveness. The AA spectra of insect larvae generally were similar except that the DL was higher in certain AA such as lysine (P < 0.01), which is an essential AA often critical for chicken growth. In contrast, the BSFL included more essential FA such as linoleic (C18:2, ω-6) and linolenic (C18:3, ω-3) acids (P < 0.01). To follow up, a husbandry trial was performed by allotting 120, 1-d-old, weight-matched, Arbor Acres broilers at random into treatment groups consisting of a low-protein diet background that contained ~20% CP supplemented with 4% BSFL and 4% or 8% DL. The average daily growth (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of broilers, compared to the control low-protein diet, were significantly improved by feeding DL diets (P < 0.01), with better live and carcass weight and higher muscle pH (P < 0.001), which were positively correlated with the inclusion level of DL (P < 0.001). However, no differences between the control and 4% BSFL diet were observed for the performance parameters mentioned above. Moreover, all birds under our experimental setting exhibited a comparable feed conversion ratio (FCR) and were in a healthy status as indicated by the meat traits and hematological indexes within normal physiological ranges. Collectively, the findings in this study provide a theoretical basis for the further exploitation of Drosophila as potential dietary ingredients for feed production in order to meet the food challenge in the future.",

These formulas are sterilized by ultra-high temperature treatment, but heating and storage may reduce bioactivity and increase formation of Maillard reaction products with potential negative consequences for immature newborns. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using preterm pigs as a model for sensitive newborn infants, the study tests the intestinal responses of feeding experimental liquid formula within 5 days. A pasteurized formula (PAST) with the same nutrient composition but less protein modifications serves as control to ultra-high temperature-treated formula without (UHT) and with prolonged storage (SUHT). Relative to PAST, UHT contains lower levels of lactoferrin and IgG. Additional storage (40 °C, 60 days, SUHT) reduces antimicrobial capacity and increases non-reducible protein aggregates and Maillard reaction products (up to 13-fold). Pigs fed SUHT have more diarrhea and show signs of intestinal inflammation (necrotizing enterocolitis) compared with pigs fed PAST and UHT. These clinical effects are accompanied by accumulation of Maillard reaction products, protein cross-links, and inflammatory responses in the gut. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that feeding UHT infant formulas, particularly after prolonged storage, adversely affects gut maturation and function in preterm pigs used as a model of preterm infants.",

      "abstract": "1. The following experiment was designed to confirm that the efficiency of dietary protein utilisation (ep) can be reduced when the AMEn to digestible crude protein (DCP) ratio of the feed falls below a critical level. In addition, whether the efficiency would be improved at high DCP contents through the addition of oil or starch was determined.2. A 14d trial (starting at 21 d of age), using BUT 6 turkeys, was designed to measure the effects on ep of four feeds (12.1 MJ AMEn/kg) with AMEn:DCP ratios ranging from 45 to 72 MJ AMEn/kg, and two additional feeds with the same DCP as the highest protein feed, one with an AMEn:DCP ratio of 59, through the addition of canola oil, and the other with a ratio of 51 MJ/kg supplemented with both starch and oil. Twenty birds constituted each experimental unit, with two replications of each sex being used per dietary treatment.3. Ten birds per sex were sampled at the start of the trial and a further five per pen at the end for carcass analysis. Each carcass including feathers was ground and subsampled for water, protein and lipid determination.4. A split-line regression described ep on the four feeds unsupplemented with additional energy (R2 = 0.81) with breakpoint at 60.6 MJ AME/kg DCP, maximum ep at 0.736 g/g, and a slope of 0.017. No improvement in ep resulted from supplementing the high protein feed with oil or a mixture of oil and starch, but feed intake and protein and lipid retention increased significantly (P < 0.05).5. The argument that insufficient energy is available to enable high protein feeds to be utilised efficiently was not corroborated by the evidence from this trial.",

Horses were individually housed and fed timothy grass hay and 2 daily concentrate meals so that protein was the first limiting nutrient and the total diet provided 120% of daily DE requirements for maintenance. On sample days, horses randomly received 0.25 g CP/kg BW of a pelleted alfalfa (AP) or commercial protein supplement (PS). Blood samples were collected before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 min post feeding and analyzed for plasma glucose, insulin and amino acid (AA) concentrations. Gluteus Medius muscle samples were obtained before and 90, 180, and 300 min after feeding and analyzed for relative abundance of phosphorylated mTOR pathway components using western immunoblot analysis. There was no effect of protein source on postprandial glucose and insulin responses (P ≥ 0.14) but consumption of PS elicited a 2 times larger AUC for essential AA (EAA), greater peak concentrations of EAA and a shorter time to reach peak EAA concentrations compared to AP. Abundance of phosphorylated mTOR (P = 0.08) and rpS6 (P = 0.10) tended to be ~1.5-fold greater after consumption of PS at 90 min compared to AP. Dephosphorylation patterns differed between protein sources and was slower for AP compared to PS. ID horses had a 2 times greater (P = 0.009) AUC and 3 times higher postprandial peak concentrations (P < 0.0001) for insulin compared to non-ID horses after consumption of both treatment pellets, but EAA responses were similar between groups (P = 0.53). Insulin status did not affect rpS6 or mTOR phosphorylation after consumption of either protein source (P ≥ 0.35), but phosphorylated rpS6 abundance was twice as high in ID compared to non-ID horses (P = 0.007). These results suggest that the consumption of higher quality protein sources may result in greater postprandial activation of the mTOR pathway compared to equal amounts of a forage-based protein source. Moreover, ID does not impair postprandial activation of mTOR and rpS6 proteins in horses following a protein-rich meal."

      "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) reduces adiposity and improves metabolism in patients with one or more symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Nonetheless, it remains elusive whether the benefits of DR in humans are mediated by calorie or nutrient restriction. This study was conducted to determine whether isocaloric dietary protein restriction is sufficient to confer the beneficial effects of dietary restriction in patients with metabolic syndrome. We performed a prospective, randomized controlled dietary intervention under constant nutritional and medical supervision. Twenty-one individuals diagnosed with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned for caloric restriction (CR; n = 11, diet of 5941 ± 686 KJ per day) or isocaloric dietary protein restriction (PR; n = 10, diet of 8409 ± 2360 KJ per day) and followed for 27 days. Like CR, PR promoted weight loss due to a reduction in adiposity, which was associated with reductions in blood glucose, lipid levels, and blood pressure. More strikingly, both CR and PR improved insulin sensitivity by 62.3% and 93.2%, respectively, after treatment. Fecal microbiome diversity was not affected by the interventions. Adipose tissue bulk RNA-Seq data revealed minor changes elicited by the interventions. After PR, terms related to leukocyte proliferation were enriched among the upregulated genes. Protein restriction is sufficient to confer almost the same clinical outcomes as calorie restriction without the need for a reduction in calorie intake. The isocaloric characteristic of the PR intervention makes this approach a more attractive and less drastic dietary strategy in clinical settings and has more significant potential to be used as adjuvant therapy for people with metabolic syndrome.",

Three different levels of dietary protein content (250, 300, and 350 g protein kg−1 diet) and two carbon sources (SB and WF) were applied (SB250, WF250, SB300, WF300, SB350, and WF350, respectively), comparing to a controlled diet without biofloc and fed on a 450 g protein kg−1 diet (C450). With the addition of SB and WF, water quality was in the ideal recommended ranges for L. vannamei culture. At the end of the experiment, the biofloc volume increased with increasing dietary protein levels. The nutritional value of biofloc in different treatments was influenced by dietary protein and added SB and WF. Increasing dietary protein significantly increased the protein and lipid contents of the produced biofloc. The use of WF as a carbon source significantly increased lipids and nitrogen-free extract in the biofloc. The total heterotrophic bacterial (THB) count was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in WF300 and WF350 than in the other treatments. The mean effect of the protein levels and carbon source was significantly reported, whereas the highest significant THB count was recorded with 300 dietary protein and using WF as a carbon source. The growth performances of L. vannamei fed with biofloc treatments were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the C450 group. The highest final weight and weight gain were recorded in SB350 treatment. The feed conversion ratio was not affected by reducing dietary protein levels; meanwhile, the protein efficiency ratio increased significantly in biofloc treatments than in the control. Overall, the results demonstrate that, compared to the control treatment of 450 dietary protein, the biofloc treatments using WF as a carbon source could compensate for the reduction in the dietary protein levels in the diet of L. vannamei and maintain higher zootechnical performance."

In the current study, the optimal dietary protein requirement for green turtle (Chelonia mydas) was investigated to support rearing in head-starting programs. Twenty-five-day-old turtles (44.5-46.2 g body weight, n = 45) were randomly distributed into 15 experimental plastic tanks, comprising three treatment replications of 3 turtles each. They were fed fishmeal-based feeds containing different levels of protein (30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, and 50%) for 8 weeks. At the end of feeding trial, growth performance (specific growth rate = 1.86% body weight/day) and feed utilization (protein efficiency ratio = 3.30 g gain/g protein) were highest in turtles fed with 40% protein in feed (p < .05). These nutritional responses were significantly supported by specific activities of fecal digestive enzymes, especially trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylase, and the amylase/trypsin ratio. Also, this dietary level improved the deposition of calcium and phosphorus in carapace, supporting a hard carapace and strong healthy bones. There were no negative effects in general health status of reared turtles, as indicated by hematological parameters. Based on a broken-line analysis between dietary protein levels and specific growth rate, the optimal protein level for green turtles was estimated as 40.6%. Findings from the current study support the use of artificial diets of specific protein levels to rear captive green turtle before release to natural habitats.",

      "abstract": "As antibiotic-free (ABF) broiler production continues to increase, understanding the development and local immune response in the intestines of ABF broilers is essential. Mitotically active cells, the majority of which will become enterocytes, help maintain the intestinal epithelial barrier. Macrophages prevent pathogen invasion by their phagocytic activity, functioning as immune response amplifying cells to aid in the recruitment of additional immune cells, and stimulating cytokine production in other adjacent cells. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate commonly used practical production practices on intestinal cell mitotic activity and local intestinal immunological responses. A randomized complete block design experiment with a 3 × 2 factorial treatment structure was conducted. The 3 dietary protein sources were: soybean meal (SBM), a mix of 50% poultry by-product meal and 50% feather meal (PFM), and porcine meat and bone meal (MBM) and broilers were reared on either new litter (NL) or used litter (UL). On d 3, 8, 11, 15, and 21, 6 birds per treatment from 6 blocks (total n = 36 per d) were randomly selected for sampling. Broilers were injected intraperitoneally with 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 1 h prior to sampling to label mitotically active cells. Samples were analyzed using cryohistology and immunofluorescence to determine the density of mitotically active cells and macrophages. Mitotically active cell and macrophage densities changed in both the duodenum and ileum over time. Neither dietary protein source nor litter condition affected mitotically active cell or macrophage densities in the duodenum on d 11 and 21 or in the ileum on d 3, 8, 11, and 15. However, on d 3 and 15 in the duodenum (P ≤ 0.0126) and d 21 in the ileum (P ≤ 0.0009), broilers reared on UL had greater mitotically active cell densities than those reared on NL. On d 8 in the duodenum, broilers fed MBM had increased macrophage density compared with those fed PFM and SBM (P ≤ 0.0401). These results indicate dietary protein source and litter condition may impact the physiology of the broiler small intestine, though additional work with this model is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms."

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether protein intake could affect the risk of pancreatic cancer. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science up to October 1, 2019. Pooled relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model. A total of 14 studies (12 case-control studies and two cohort studies) were included. Overall, total protein intake had no significant association on the risk of pancreatic cancer (RR = 1.02, 95%CI= 0.85-1.22, I2=45.7%). Subgroup analyses showed such relationships were almost not influenced by study design and geographic location. Interestingly, when we performed the subgroup analysis by protein type, the opposite association was found in animal protein intake (RR = 1.37, 95%CI= 0.93-2.01) and vegetable protein intake (RR = 0.78, 95%CI= 0.54-1.14), although these two groups were not statistically significant. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that dietary total protein intake may be not associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, protein type may be affecting the result which was found from our research. Therefore, studies with detailed information, especially protein type, are warranted to further confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Engaging in both resistance and endurance exercise within the same training program, termed 'concurrent exercise training,' is common practice in many athletic disciplines that require a combination of strength and endurance and is recommended by a number of organizations to improve muscular and cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic metabolic disease. Dietary protein ingestion supports skeletal muscle remodeling after exercise by stimulating the synthesis of muscle proteins and can optimize resistance exercise-training mediated increases in skeletal muscle size and strength; however, the effects of protein supplementation on acute and longer-term adaptive responses to concurrent resistance and endurance exercise are unclear. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the effects of dietary protein supplementation on acute changes in muscle protein synthesis and longer-term changes in muscle mass, strength, and aerobic capacity in responses to concurrent resistance and endurance exercise in healthy adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in five databases: Scopus, Embase, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science. Acute and longer-term controlled trials involving concurrent exercise and protein supplementation in healthy adults (ages 18-65 years) were included in this systematic review. Main outcomes of interest were changes in skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates, muscle mass, muscle strength, and whole-body aerobic capacity (i.e., maximal/peak aerobic capacity [VO2max/peak]). The quality of studies was assessed using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment for Controlled Intervention Studies. RESULTS: Four acute studies including 84 trained young males and ten longer-term studies including 167 trained and 391 untrained participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. All included acute studies demonstrated that protein ingestion enhanced myofibrillar protein synthesis rates, but not mitochondrial protein synthesis rates during post-exercise recovery after an acute bout of concurrent exercise. Of the included longer-term training studies, five out of nine reported that protein supplementation enhanced concurrent training-mediated increases in muscle mass, while five out of nine studies reported that protein supplementation enhanced concurrent training-mediated increases in muscle strength and/or power. In terms of aerobic adaptations, all six included studies reported no effect of protein supplementation on concurrent training-mediated increases in VO2max/peak. CONCLUSION: Protein ingestion after an acute bout of concurrent exercise further increases myofibrillar, but not mitochondrial, protein synthesis rates during post-exercise recovery. There is some evidence that protein supplementation during longer-term training further enhances concurrent training-mediated increases in skeletal muscle mass and strength/power, but not whole-body aerobic capacity (i.e., VO2max/peak).",

      "abstract": "Sufficient dietary protein intake is vital to maintaining muscle health with aging. Yet protein intake among adults is often inadequate. This study's main objective was to examine the impact of nutrition education (NE) and a per-meal protein prescription (PRx) with versus without diet coaching on protein intake. A secondary objective examined its effects on muscle health. Participants included 53 women, age 45-64 years. All participants received NE and PRx; those randomized to coached-group received 10-weeks of diet coaching. Assessments included: protein intake at baseline, weeks 4 and 12 and muscle health (muscle mass, grip strength, five-chair rise test, 4 mgait speed test). The Chi-square test examined percentages of participants meeting PRx between groups. Repeated measures analysis of variance assessed within group and intervention effects on protein intake and muscle health parameters. Protein intake (g/kg body weight) increased (p < 0.001): not-coached (n = 28) 0.8 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.3 and coached (n = 25) 1.0 ± 0.2 to 1.4 ± 0.3 with no significant difference between groups. A greater percentage of coached-group participants met (p = 0.04) breakfast (72%) and met (p < 0.001) three-meal (76%) PRx versus not-coached participants (25% and 53%, respectively). Participants in both groups exhibited significantly (p < 0.001) improved times for the five-chair rise test and 4 mgait speed test. Diet coaching in conjunction with a PRx and NE should be considered to assist individuals in improving protein intake through self-selection of protein-rich foods.",

      "abstract": "Azolla is a freshwater floating aquatic fern found in the tropical, subtropical and temperate regions with a high nitrogen-fixing rate from the result of symbiotic relationship with the blue-green cyanobacterium, Anabaena azollae. Azolla can effectively remediate aquaculture wastewater owing to its high production capacity and the ability to absorb nutrients and toxic compounds. The Azolla biomass generated as a by-product is currently underutilized and could potentially benefit the aquafeed industry in replacing the unfeasible and expensive fishmeal protein at a certain level. This study evaluates the incorporation of red tilapia wastewater-raised Azolla as a dietary protein for the growth performance, feed efficiency, survival, body indices, body composition and nutrient utilization of Pangasius catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus during a 90-days feeding experiment. Dried Azolla was incorporated into four isonitrogenous (30 g kg-1) and isolipidic (12 g kg-1) practical diets containing 0 g kg-1 (Control), 10 g kg-1 (A10), 20 g kg-1 (A20) and 30 g kg-1 (A30) fishmeal protein replacement. One hundred and twenty juveniles with an initial mean weight of 45 ± 15 g were distributed into 12 tanks representing four dietary treatments in triplicates. Results showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in Pangasius catfish fed 10 g kg-1 Azolla protein. Beyond that, WG, SGR, PER and FCR decreased to the lowest value when fed with 30 g kg-1 Azolla protein. No significant (p > 0.05) effects were recorded for feed intake, survival, body indices and nutrient utilization amongst all dietary treatments. In conclusion, Azolla raised from red tilapia aquaculture wastewater can replace fishmeal protein up to 10 g kg-1 in the diet of Pangasius catfish juveniles having better growth, feed efficiency and nutrient utilization without affecting its survival, body indices and body composition.",

Our research investigated the effects of hydrolyzed wheat protein (HWP), fermented soybean meal (FSBM), and enzyme-treated soybean meal (ESBM) on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immunity, fecal microbiota and metabolites of weaned piglets. A total of 144 piglets (weaned at 28 d) were allotted to 3 dietary treatments with 6 replicate pens per treatment and 8 piglets per pen. This study included 2 periods: d 0 to14 for phase 1 and d 15 to 28 for phase 2. Dietary treatments contained 15.90% HWP, 15.80% FSBM, and 15.10% ESBM in phase 1, and 7.90% HWP, 7.80% FSBM, and 7.50% ESBM in phase 2, respectively. The ADG of piglets in ESBM was increased (P < 0.05) compared with HWP and FSBM during d 1-28. Compared with HWP and FSBM, ESBM increased (P < 0.05) the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and the serum level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in piglets on d 14, as well as increased (P < 0.05) the serum FRAP level in piglets on d 28. ESBM decreased (P < 0.05) serum levels of DAO and IL-1β in piglets compared with HWP on d 28. ESBM enhanced (P < 0.05) the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Oscillospiraceae and Christensenellaceae, as well as reduced the relative abundance of Clostridiaceae in the feces compared with HWP and FSBM. The PICRUSt analysis revealed that the number of gene tags related to degradation of valine, leucine and isoleucine, as well as lysine degradation in ESBM were lower (P < 0.05) than that in HWP and FSBM. ESBM increased (P < 0.05) the fecal butyrate level in piglets compared with FSBM, and ESBM tended to decrease (P = 0.076) the fecal cadaverine level. Overall, ESBM had advantages over HWP and FSBM in improving antioxidant status, immune function, fecal bacteria and metabolites for weaned piglets."

      "abstract": "Manipulating dietary macronutrient intake may modulate adaptive responses to exercise, and improve endurance performance. However, there is controversy as to the impact of short-term dietary modification on athletic performance. In a parallel-groups, repeated measures study, 16 trained endurance runners (maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O2max): 64.2 ± 5.6 mL·kg-1·min-1) were randomly assigned to, and provided with, either a high-protein, reduced-carbohydrate (PRO) or a high-carbohydrate (CHO) isocaloric-matched diet. Participants maintained their training load over 21-consecutive days with dietary intake consisting of 7-days habitual intake (T1), 7-days intervention diet (T2) and 7-days return to habitual intake (T3). Following each 7-day dietary period (T1-T3), a micro-muscle biopsy was taken for assessment of gene expression, before participants underwent laboratory assessment of a 10 km treadmill run at 75% V˙O2max, followed by a 95% V˙O2max time to exhaustion (TTE) trial. The PRO diet resulted in a modest change (1.37-fold increase, p = 0.016) in AMPK expression, coupled with a significant increase in fat oxidation (0.29 ± 0.05 to 0.59 ± 0.05 g·min-1, p < 0.0001). However, a significant reduction of 23.3% (p = 0.0003) in TTE post intervention was observed; this reverted back to pre levels following a return to the habitual diet. In the CHO group, whilst no change in sub-maximal fuel utilisation occurred at T2, a significant 6.5% increase in TTE performance (p = 0.05), and a modest, but significant, increase in AMPK (p = 0.042) and PPAR (p = 0.029) mRNA expression compared to T1 were observed; with AMPK (p = 0.011) and PPAR (p = 0.044) remaining significantly elevated at T3. In conclusion, a 7-day isocaloric high protein diet significantly compromised high intensity exercise performance in trained runners with no real benefit on gene markers of training adaptation. A significant increase in fat oxidation during submaximal exercise was observed post PRO intervention, but this returned to pre levels once the habitual diet was re-introduced, suggesting that the response was driven via fuel availability rather than cellular adaptation. A short-term high protein, low carbohydrate diet in combination with endurance training is not preferential for endurance running performance.",

Forty steers with an initial live weight of 486 ± 37 kg were assigned to one of two treatment groups fed either a concentrate diet with 14.5% CP and or with 17% CP for 6 months. Biopsy samples of intramuscular tissue were collected to analyze the fatty acid composition and gene expression at 23 months of age. Throughout the entire experimental period, all steers were restrained twice daily to allow individual feeding. Growth performance, blood metabolites, and carcass traits, according to ultrasonic measurements, were not affected by the experimental diets. The high-protein diet significantly increased the expression of intramuscular PPARα (p < 0.1) and LPL (p < 0.05) but did not affect genes involved in fatty acid uptake (CD36 and FABP4) nor lipogenesis (ACACA, FASN, and SCD). In addition, it downregulated intramuscular VLCAD (p < 0.01) related to lipogenesis but also GPAT1 (p = 0.001), DGAT2 (p = 0.016), and SNAP23 (p = 0.057), which are involved in fatty acid esterification and adipocyte size. Hanwoo steers fed a high-protein diet at 18-23 months of age resulted in a relatively lower lipid turnover rate than steers fed a low-protein diet, which could be responsible for shortening the feeding period."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants (65-75 years old) with a body mass index between 20 and 35 kg/m2 of a larger randomized control trial who consented to an oral health assessment were recruited. They had ad libitum access to one of four experimental diets (omnivorous higher fat or higher carbohydrate, semi-vegetarian higher fat or higher carbohydrate) for 4 weeks. The periodontal examination included periodontal probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing. Oral plaque and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were collected before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Between baseline and follow up, the number of sites with a CAL <5 mm (mean difference [MD] -5.11 ± 9.68, p = .039) increased and the GCF amount (MD -23.42 ± 39.42 Periotron Units [PU], p = .050) decreased for the semi-vegetarian high-fat diet. For the mean proportion of sites with PPD reduction of >1 mm and CAL gain of >1 mm, significant differences were calculated between the diets investigated. The clinical parameters were not associated with changes in the oral microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provided evidence that a semi-vegetarian high-fat diet provides benefits to clinical parameters of periodontal health.

METHODS: The medical data of 150 DN patients treated in Wuhan No.1 Hospital (June 2018-May 2021) were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received regular therapy, those who received the intervention of restricting dietary protein intake were included in the control group (n = 75), and on this basis, those treated with Buyang Huanwu decoction were included in the experimental group (n = 75), so as to scientifically evaluate their efficacy and inflammatory factor levels after treatment. RESULTS: The patients' general information was not statistically different between the two groups (P > 0.05); after treatment, the experimental group gained remarkably higher marked effective rate and total effective rate of treatment than the control group (P < 0.05); the inflammatory factor levels of all patients were obviously better than before (P < 0.05), and the levels of TNF-α, IL-2, IL-8, IL-4, and IL-10 were obviously lower in the experimental group than in the control group (P < 0.05); the levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin of all patients were remarkably lower than before (P < 0.05), but with no significant between-group difference (P > 0.05); the renal function indexes of all patients were better than before, and between the two groups, the levels of 24 h microalbuminuria, 24 h urine protein excretion, and serum creatinine were obviously lower and the glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in the experimental group (P all <0.05), and the patients' traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) symptom scores were remarkably lower in the experimental group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Jointly applying Buyang Huanwu decoction on the basis of restricting dietary protein intake can effectively promote the clinical efficacy of DN, which is conducive to adjusting the inflammatory factor levels, promoting the patients' renal function, and alleviating the clinical symptoms."

      "abstract": "Compound-specific stable isotope analysis of individual amino acids (AAs) has been widely used in studies on food webs, resource tracing, and biochemical cycling. In the present study, juvenile sea cucumbers Apostichopus japonicus were fed the microalga Cylindrotheca fusiformis (CF) or Sargassum thunbergii (ST) during a 130-day experiment. The δ13C values of individual AAs in the experimental diet and body wall of sea cucumbers were determined to calculate the variability in carbon isotopic fractionation (Δ13C) and elucidate the isotopic routing of essential AAs and biosynthesis of nonessential AAs. The results showed that the sea cucumbers fed with diet CF had higher specific growth and ingestion rates but relatively lower feed conversion efficiency compared to those fed with diet ST. The experimental diets were generally less abundant in nonessential AAs (i.e., glycine, serine, aspartic acid, and arginine) but more abundant in essential AAs (i.e., isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, and histidine) than body walls. The fluctuations in the δ13C values of total AAs analyzed were 19.8 ± 4.6‰ for diets and 21.3 ± 2.7‰ for body walls. Serine and threonine were 13C-enriched AAs, while leucine and phenylalanine were 13C-depleted AAs. The diet ST treatment exhibited more positive Δ13C values of nonessential AAs (e.g., glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, and proline) compared to diet CF. There were significant negative relationships between Δ13C values and differences in nonessential AA percent abundance between the experimental diets and body walls of sea cucumber (for diet CF: y = -0.79 - 0.56x, r2 = 0.47; diet ST: y = 0.75 - 0.29x, r2 = 0.51), which implied the flexibility in the routing of various dietary macronutrients (protein, lipids, and carbohydrates) by sea cucumber. This study can greatly provide a new understanding of nutrient utilization and metabolism routing during juvenile sea cucumber culturing.",

This study evaluated the effects of altering the crude protein (CP) content of dietary supplements included in dairy rations fed to grazing organic dairy herds, on milk production and composition. Six commercial organic farms participated in a 6-wk trial, consisting of a 2-wk baseline period and 4-wk experimental period. Farms were paired by their summer 2017 milk urea nitrogen profile, and farms within each pair were assigned by restricted randomization to (1) continuation of their regular supplements (n = 3, control group, CON), or (2) supplement with altered CP as percentage of dry matter, formulated using an organic barley and roasted soybean mix (n = 3, treatment group, TRT). Throughout the 6-wk trial, individual milk samples were collected at 2 consecutive milkings weekly, while pasture and supplement samples, pasture measurements, and management information were collected twice weekly per farm. Data were statistically analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.) for all parameters, and effects of treatment, week, and their interaction (treatment × week) were determined. The supplement CP (percentage of dry matter) during the baseline period was 13.5% for CON and 15.3% for TRT and 14.8% for CON and 19.3% for TRT during the experimental period. Milk production was 21% higher during the experimental period for TRT compared with CON (24.1 vs. 19.9 kg of milk per day, respectively). Milk production decreased for CON from wk 1 to wk 6 (23.6 vs. 20.4 kg of milk per day), whereas TRT maintained milked production from wk 1 to wk 6 (22.8 vs. 22.7 kg of milk per day). Milk composition was different between groups, with CON having higher fat percent (4.21 vs. 3.73%, respectively) and protein percent (3.15 vs. 3.05%, respectively) compared with TRT for the 6 wk. The milk urea nitrogen concentrations were similar between TRT and CON for the baseline period (11.9 vs. 12.1 mg/dL) and the final week of the experimental period (14.5 vs. 14.2 mg/dL). Although the effects of different diet CP fractions, particularly rumen undegradable protein and soluble protein, must be further delineated, these results indicate that altering the CP content of dietary supplements fed to grazing organic dairy cattle during the summer period in the Northeast US could be a useful mechanism to maintain milk production.",

      "abstract": "Our objective was to quantify the contribution of body weight (BW) change to the overall response of lactating dairy cows to a shortage of dietary protein. Lactating Holstein cows (n = 166; 92 primiparous, 74 multiparous) with initial milk yield of 41 ± 10 kg/d were fed high and low-protein diets in 7 blocks. Blocks were repeated in the same crossover design with periods of 28 to 35 d. Production of 69 of the 166 cows (42 primiparous, 27 multiparous) was also measured in late lactation. Low-protein diets were 14% crude protein (CP) in peak lactation and 13% CP in late lactation and were formulated to contain adequate rumen-degradable protein to maintain rumen function but inadequate rumen undegradable protein for the average cow in this study. High-protein diets were 18% CP in peak lactation and 16% CP in late lactation and contained extra expeller soybean meal to meet metabolizable protein requirements. Body weight changes were used to predict body energy and protein changes, which were added to milk components to calculate total captured energy and protein. Fixed effects of diet, parity, treatment sequence nested in each block, treatment period nested in block, interaction of diet and parity, and the random effects of block and cow nested within block were included in the model to compare cow responses to diets within each lactation stage. In peak lactation, reducing protein from 18 to 14% resulted in estimated daily losses of 2.9 Mcal of milk energy, 2.2 Mcal of body energy, 127 g of milk protein, and 16 g of body protein. Therefore, BW loss accounted for 43% of the decrease in captured energy and 11% of the decrease in captured protein when cows were fed deficient protein. In late lactation, BW loss accounted for 51% of the decrease in captured energy and 14% of the decrease in captured protein when cows were fed deficient protein. We suggest that BW change should be considered when assessing cow responses to changes in dietary protein.",

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of β-mannanase supplementation in low energy/protein diets on egg production, egg quality, and apparent ileal digestibility of the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and amino acids in 21-week-old Single Comb White Leghorn hens (Hy-Line W-36). A total of 192 hens (8 replicates of 6 hens per treatment) for a production study (Exp. 1) and a total of 64 hens (8 replicates of 2 hens per treatment) for a digestibility study (Exp. 2) were randomly allocated to 4 experimental treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Four dietary treatments were control (CS) based on corn and 44% CP soybean meal (ME: 2,850 kcal/kg CP: 18.5%) and CS-low energy/protein (CSL) (ME: 2,750 kcal/kg CP: 17.5%), with or without 0.05% β-mannanase enzyme. Hens were fed the experimental diets for 14 d for the digestibility study and 8 wk for the production study. Hen-day egg production (HDEP), weekly feed intake, FCR, and biweekly egg quality parameters were measured. Significant interaction on feed intake (P < 0.01) was observed between energy/protein and enzyme. At 3, 6 and 8 wk, the feed intake and FCR of CSL with enzyme were significantly lower than those of CSL without enzymes. The main effects indicated that birds fed diets without inclusion of β-mannanase had higher feed intake than those fed diets with enzymes at 4, 7, and 8 wk. The inclusion of β-mannanase significantly increased (P < 0.05) HDEP at 2, 3, 5, and 7 wk. However, there was no significant effect of nutrient density or enzyme supplementation on egg quality parameters. The digestibility study showed that the inclusion of β-mannanase significantly improved (P < 0.01) apparent ileal digestibility of lysine, histidine and tryptophan in the diet. The results of these experiments indicate that supplementation of β-mannanase could reduce the feed intake and FCR and improve HDEP and apparent ileal digestibility of key amino acids in corn/soy diets fed to laying hens.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of different types of dietary protein on urinary albumin excretion and glomerular filtration rate in individuals with diabetes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus were searched for all published RCTs, with no language restriction, up to July 2020. DATA EXTRACTION: Study selection and data extraction were performed independently by 3 authors. Risk of bias was assessed independently by 2 authors, and the GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs were included, of which 11 (involving 228 participants) were compiled in meta-analyses of random-effects models. Interventions consisted of diets emphasizing plant or white meat protein, with reduced intake of animal or red meat protein. Pooled data from crossover trials (n = 8) favored intervention diets for urinary albumin excretion (ratio of means, 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.94; I2 = 4%) and glomerular filtration rate (ratio of means, 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.94; I2 = 45%), compared with control diets. Results from parallel-design studies (n = 3), however, were not statistically significant for any outcome. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, and most studies were judged with at least some concerns in terms of risk of bias. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found weak evidence for small to moderate improvements in markers of kidney function in favor of interventions with lower animal protein (or red meat protein) compared with usual diets in short-term crossover trials. These findings require confirmation in well-designed randomized controlled trials.",

Moreover, the effects of dietary protein on soils and soil microbes remain unclear. To elucidate this, we examined soil bacterial and fungal community composition and temporal changes in paddy fields subjected to different protein-content diets via 16S/18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis with a high-throughput next-generation sequencer. MiSeq sequencing revealed that protein content significantly impacted fungal community structure. High-protein diets reduced bacterial community diversity and relative abundance in both July and October. The phylum-level bacterial taxonomic composition was not affected by diet treatment, while in fungi, a major phylum-level shift was evident. Hierarchically clustered analysis showed that high-protein diets significantly reduced the relative abundance of Brevundimonas in both July and October. Saprotrophic macrofungal diversity was negatively related to dietary protein content. Considering microbial community structure and environmental factors, ca. 15% protein content is appropriate for the rice-crab co-culture system that we studied."

      "abstract": "Limited research with growing ruminants indicates that oscillating (OS) dietary crude protein (CP) concentration may improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Our aim was to determine if a total mixed ration (TMR) based on OS CP (48-h phases of 13.4% and 16.5% CP, respectively) would increase NUE of lactating dairy cows compared with a static CP TMR (ST; 14.9% CP). The experiment was a randomized complete block design with 50 cows [150 ± 61 (mean ± SD) d in milk]. Cows were blocked by parity, days in milk, and milk protein yield. On average, diets were equal in composition over the total experiment. Cows were milked twice daily, and 8 milk samples were collected in each 4-d period. Each 48 h of low-CP (LP) and high-CP (HP) TMR offered to OS cows corresponded to milk collected at milkings 1 to 4 and 5 to 8, respectively. Dry matter intake (mean = 25.5 kg/d for both treatment groups); yields of milk (mean = 31.5 kg/d for both treatment groups), protein, fat, lactose, and fat- and protein-corrected milk (mean = 33.6 kg/d for both treatment groups); and milk concentration of protein, fat, and lactose did not differ between treatments. However, milk urea concentration was higher for OS compared with ST (12.2 vs. 11.3 mg/dL). Body weight, body condition score, NUE, and feed efficiency were unaffected by OS. Apparent total-tract digestibility of dry matter (695 vs. 677 g/kg), organic matter (714 vs. 697 g/kg), CP (624 vs. 594 g/kg), neutral detergent fiber (530 vs. 499 g/kg), and starch (976 vs. 973 g/kg) were higher for OS than for ST cows. Cows in OS responded transiently, and regression analysis of differences within block over time revealed changes in yield of milk (-531 g/d), milk protein (-25.6 g/d), and milk lactose (-16.7 g/d) in LP. Opposite effects were observed for yield of milk (+612 g/d), milk protein (+28.8 g/d), and milk lactose (+28.0 g/d) during HP. Changes in concentrations of milk protein (-0.050%/d), lactose (+0.030%/d), and urea (-3.0 mg/dL per day) during LP, and in milk lactose (-0.024%/d) and urea (+4.3 mg/dL per day) during HP, were observed. Milk yield, lactose yield, and protein yield were lower for OS than ST cows at the last milking of LP and at the first milking of HP. Milk urea concentration did not show such a lag and was lower in the last 2 milkings of LP, and higher in the last 3 milkings of HP, in OS compared with ST cows. Overall, performance and NUE were unaffected by OS treatment, but apparent total-tract digestibility and milk urea concentration increased, and transient effects on milk yield and composition occurred in OS cows.",

Thirty-six multiparous Holstein cows were blocked by parity, expected calving date, and previous lactation milk yield at -21 d relative to expected calving and were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 close-up period dietary treatments providing low MP (LMP) or high MP (HMP) diets with controlled intake (CNI) or ad libitum intake (ALI). The concentrations of MP were 65 and 90 g/kg dry matter for LMP and HMP diets, respectively, whereas intake was controlled to supply 100 and 160% of the NRC (2001) energy requirements for CNI and ALI groups, respectively. The concentration of net energy for lactation (NEL) in the treatment diets was 1.50 Mcal/kg. All cows were fed a similar lactation diet after calving (1.50 Mcal/kg of NEL and 83.3 g/kg of MP). The HMP diet increased dry matter intake during the first 3 wk and tended to increase dry matter intake over the 9 wk of lactation. Meal size and eating rate increased in the ALI cows during the prepartum period. Meal frequency increased with the HMP diet during the postpartum period. Milk yield increased by 15.2% with the HMP diet over the 9 wk of lactation. The HMP diet increased energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield in CNI versus ALI cows, whereas the LMP diet increased ECM yield in ALI versus CNI cows over the 9 wk of lactation. The increase in ECM yield of LMP-ALI versus LMP-CNI cows was supported by greater body condition loss and serum β-hydroxybutyrate over the 9 wk of lactation. Taken together, these data indicate that prepartum controlled intake of a high protein diet can provide the benefits of both strategies.",

In addition, the limitation of early weight gain by dietary energy and protein dilution on some welfare parameters, tibiotarsus measurements, fear and mobility level was examined.2. A total of 504 male, one-day-old broiler chickens (Ross 308) were randomly allocated to four treatments with three replicate pens per treatment and 42 broiler chickens per pen as a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Treatments included feeding the basal control diet between 0-42 days or a diet diluted by 10% energy and 20% crude protein fed between 0-21 d, with the control diet fed between 22-42 d. The second factor was the presence or absence of barrier perches. All treatments were allocated as a completely randomised design. Welfare parameters (foot pad dermatitis, hock burn, gait score, feather score, breast blister), tibiotarsus measurements (bone mineral content, bone mineral density, fluctuating asymmetry and relative fluctuating asymmetry), tonic immobility and mobility level were recorded.3. Results showed that access to a barrier perch and the diluted diet increased the mobility in broiler chickens. However, access to a barrier perch had no significant effect on tibiotarsus and welfare parameters. Broiler chickens had better gait scores (P < 0.05) and lower foot pad dermatitis incidence (P < 0.01) in groups fed the diluted diet. The diluted diet had no significant effect on bone mineral density but reduced the tibiotarsus bone mineral content (P < 0.05).4. In conclusion, the diluted diet provided positive effects in terms of leg health due to weight gain limitations in the early period, thus improving broiler chicken welfare.",

The combination of measuring respiratory gas (O2 and CO2) exchange, nitrogenous (ammonia and urea) excretion, specific dynamic action (SDA), metabolic energy substrate use, and whole-body protein synthesis in spiny lobster, Sagmariasus verreauxi, was examined in relation to dietary protein. Three isoenergetic feeds were formulated with varying crude protein: 40%, 50% and 60%, corresponding to CP40, CP50 and CP60 treatments, respectively. Total CO2 and ammonia excretion, SDA magnitude and coefficient, and protein synthesis in the CP60 treatment were higher compared to the CP40 treatment. These differences demonstrate dietary protein influences post-prandial energy metabolism. Metabolic use of each major energy substrate varied at different post-prandial times, indicating suitable amounts of high-quality protein with major non-protein energy-yielding nutrients, lipid and carbohydrate, are critical for lobsters. The average contribution of protein oxidation was lowest in the CP50 treatment, suggesting mechanisms underlying the most efficient retention of dietary protein and suitable dietary inclusion. This study advances understanding of how deficient and surplus dietary protein affects energy metabolism and provides approaches for fine-scale feed evaluation to support sustainable aquaculture.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disorder, primarily characterized by skin plaques. It is linked to co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Several studies demonstrate that dietary habits can influence psoriasis development and severity. However, the effect of different dietary protein levels on psoriasis development and severity is poorly understood. In this study, we examine the influence of dietary protein on psoriasis-like skin disease in mice. METHODS: We fed male C57BL/6J mice with regular, low protein and high protein chow for 4 weeks. Afterwards, we induced psoriasis-like skin disease by topical imiquimod (IMQ)-treatment on ear and back skin. The local cutaneous and systemic inflammatory response was investigated using flow cytometry analysis, histology and quantitative rt-PCR. RESULTS: After 5 days of IMQ-treatment, both diets reduced bodyweight in mice, whereas only the high protein diet slightly aggravated IMQ-induced skin inflammation. IMQ-treatment induced infiltration of myeloid cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages into skin and spleen independently of diet. After IMQ-treatment, circulating neutrophils and reactive oxygen species were increased in mice on low and high protein diets. CONCLUSION: Different dietary protein levels had no striking effect on IMQ-induced psoriasis but aggravated the systemic pro-inflammatory phenotype.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Resistance exercises and dietary protein have been shown to reverse frailty, yet they are not commonly offered in clinical practice. We aim to measure changes in health outcomes, including physical frailty status (SHARE-FI), clinical frailty status (CFS) and muscle mass, as a result of an optimised exercise and dietary intervention versus usual care in a primary care (PC) setting. The intervention has been derived from our systematic review and meta-analysis findings and optimised through patient and public involvement and multidisciplinary team input. Methods: This study is a multicentre randomised controlled parallel arm trial with a three month follow up. 210 eligible people aged 65 and over, no more than mildly frail, will be recruited in seven PC practices in Ireland and randomly assigned to 'intervention' or 'usual care'. Intervention participants will be provided a leaflet with strength exercises, protein dietary guidance and educational discussion. Baseline measurements will include demographics, health indicators, comorbidities, malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST), frailty status (SHARE-FI, CFS) and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance). Primary outcome will be frailty status measured by SHARE-FI at three months. Secondary outcomes include CFS, muscle mass, in-patient hospitalisation, long term care admission, and subjective ease of intervention and difference to general health. Statistical analysis will be undertaken by an independent statistician. Discussion: The diversity of tested frailty interventions and lack of clear guidance may contribute to low implementation rates. The REFEREE trial focusses on an optimised intervention for a syndrome that poses growing individual and societal challenges. It is hoped results can encourage mainstream adoption of interventions to reverse clinical frailty and build resilience in primary care.

      "abstract": "Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism that results from mutations in genes involved in molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis. MoCD is characterized clinically by intractable seizures and severe, rapidly progressing neurodegeneration leading to death in early childhood in the majority of known cases. We report on a patient with an unusual late disease onset and mild phenotype, characterized by delayed development and a decline triggered by a febrile illness and a subsequent dystonic movement disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal signal intensities of the bilateral basal ganglia. Blood and urine chemistry tests demonstrated remarkably low serum and urinary uric acid levels. A urine sulfite test was positive. Specific diagnostic workup showed elevated levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine in serum with increased urinary sulfocysteine (SSC) levels. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous missense mutation at c.1510C > T (p.504R > W) in exon 10 of the MOCS1 in isoform 7 (rs1387934803). At age 1 year 4 months, the patient was placed on a low protein diet to reduce cysteine load and accumulation of sulfite and SCC in tissues. At 3 months after introduction of protein restriction, the urine sulfite test became negative and the urine SCC level was decreased. After starting the protein restriction diet, dystonic movement improved, and the patient's course progressed without regression and seizures. Electroencephalogram findings were remarkably improved. This finding demonstrates that the dietary protein restriction suppresses disease progression in mild cases of MoCD and suggests the effectiveness of dietary therapy in MoCD."

To study the effect of this approach, 212 older adults (72.2 ± 6.3 years) were randomised in three groups: control, exercise, or exercise plus dietary counselling. The dietary counselling during the 6-month intervention was a blended approach of face-to-face contacts and videoconferencing, and it was discontinued for a 6-month follow-up. Dietary protein intake, sources, product groups, resulting amino acid intake, and intake per eating occasion were assessed by a 3-day dietary record. The dietary counselling group was able to increase the protein intake by 32% at 6 months, and the intake remained 16% increased at 12 months. Protein intake mainly consisted of animal protein sources: dairy products, followed by fish and meat. This resulted in significantly more intake of essential amino acids, including leucine. The protein intake was distributed evenly over the day, resulting in more meals that reached the protein and leucine targets. Digitally supported dietary counselling was effective in increasing protein intake both per meal and per day in a lifestyle intervention in community-dwelling older adults. This was predominantly achieved by consuming more animal protein sources, particularly dairy products, and especially during breakfast and lunch.",

      "abstract": "Faecal proteomics targeting biomarkers of immunity and inflammation have demonstrated clinical application for the identification of changes in gastrointestinal function. However, there are limited comprehensive analyses of the host faecal proteome and how it may be influenced by dietary factors. To examine this, the Homo sapiens post-diet proteome of older males was analysed at the completion of a 10-week dietary intervention, either meeting the minimum dietary protein recommendations (RDA; n = 9) or twice the recommended dietary allowance (2RDA, n = 10). The host faecal proteome differed markedly between individuals, with only a small subset of proteins present in ≥ 60% of subjects (14 and 44 proteins, RDA and 2RDA, respectively, with only 7 common to both groups). No differences were observed between the diet groups on the profiles of host faecal proteins. Faecal proteins were detected from a wide range of protein classes, with high inter-individual variation and absence of obvious impact in response to diets with markedly different protein intake. This suggests that well-matched whole food diets with two-fold variation in protein intake maintained for 10 weeks have minimal impact on human faecal host proteins."

HFpEF impairs physical performance and thus reduces quality of life. Increasing dietary protein intake can increase lean body mass and physical performance in healthy elderly individuals, but the effect of a high-quality protein supplement, with or without a structured exercise program, has not been investigated in HFpEF patients. Twenty-three obese elderly HFpEF patients with grade 1 or 2 diastolic dysfunction were randomized into three groups: control, protein supplementation alone, and protein plus exercise. Protein supplementation involved providing sufficient whey protein so that total intake was 1.2 g protein/kg/day. The exercise intervention was 2 days of hydrotherapy and 1 day of gym sessions per week under supervision of a fitness expert. Physical parameters and functional tests were performed at baseline and at 12 weeks. Protein supplementation alone failed to improve physical performance. However, when combined with light exercise, there was significant improvement in some (6-minute walk, 10 m walking speed, quadriceps strength), but not all, physical function measurements. The results of this pilot study suggest that further exploration of potential interactive effects between protein supplementation and light exercise in individuals with HFpEF is warranted."

METHODS: The cross-sectional study was performed using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A total of 4,020 participants (men, 1,698 and women, 2,322) were analyzed in the present study. Sarcopenia is defined according to the criteria for the Asia Working Group for Sarcopenia. To evaluate the adequacy of protein intake, the value obtained by dividing the amount of protein consumed through food by the daily recommended protein amount (50 g/day) of Korean males was defined as the nutrient intake ratio. RESULTS: Total protein (P&lt;0.001 in men, P&lt;0.001 in women) and low dietary intake protein (P&lt;0.001 in men, P=0.046 in women) were significantly lower in the sarcopenia group than in the normal group, and were significantly lower in the osteosarcopenia group than in the normal group for both men and women. The cut-off value of the adjusted weight of protein intake for sarcopenia was 0.58 g/kg/day in men and 0.98 g/kg/day in women. The cut-off value for adjusted weight of protein intake for osteo-sarcopenia was 0.8 g/kg/day in men and 0.5 g/kg/day in women. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive dietary assessment to detect nutritional deficits that predispose one to or aggravate muscle atrophy is important for establishing a treatment plan for patients with malnutrition."

      "abstract": "Lifelong dietary treatment is recommended in the management of phenylketonuria (PKU). Accordingly, an increasing adult population require age-specific PKU guidelines on protein requirements to support changing metabolic demands across the lifespan. Given that protein intake for dietary management of PKU is primarily (52-80%) derived from protein substitutes, the prescribing practice of protein substitutes must be underpinned by robust evidence. Whilst dietary guidelines for PKU management is evolving to incorporate adult specific protein recommendations, the scientific evidence underpinning these guidelines is currently limited. Instead, the determination of protein requirements for people with PKU have previously been extrapolated from estimates derived from the general healthy population, based on arguably outdated nitrogen balance methodology. Furthermore, a compensatory factor of 20-40% has been incorporated to account for the reduced uptake and utilisation of the elemental amino acids contained in protein substitutes. However, research informing this compensatory factor has been conducted in younger adults, with the majority of studies in non-PKU individuals. Given extensive evidence that the muscle anabolic response to ingested protein is impaired in older vs. young adults, the validity of current dietary protein recommendations for adults and older adults with PKU has been challenged. This narrative review aims to critically evaluate the existing scientific evidence underpinning current guidelines on protein requirements for adults with PKU, highlighting existing gaps in knowledge and directions for future research. We argue that current guidelines on protein requirements need updating to optimise long-term physical and functional outcomes in older adults with PKU.",

      "abstract": "Our objectives were to determine (1) the sources of variation in cow responses to dietary protein reduction, and (2) the association of low dietary protein resilience (LPR) with protein efficiency. Lactating Holstein cows in peak lactation (n = 166; 92 primiparous, 77 multiparous) with initial milk yield 41 ± 9.8 kg/d were fed high-protein (HP) or low-protein (LP) diets in 4-wk periods in a crossover design with half the cows fed LP first and half fed HP first. The study was repeated for 69 of these cows (42 primiparous, 27 multiparous) in late lactation. Low-protein diets were 14% crude protein (CP) in peak lactation and 13% CP in late lactation and were formulated to contain adequate rumen-degradable protein to maintain rumen function but inadequate rumen-undegradable protein for cows with average production in this study to maintain their production. High-protein diets were 18% CP in peak lactation and 16% CP in late lactation and contained extra expeller soybean meal to meet metabolizable protein requirements. Protein efficiency was defined as the protein captured in milk or in both milk and body tissues per unit of consumed protein. Low dietary protein resilience was calculated for each cow in peak and late lactation based on actual intake, production, and body weight measures. The ability of a cow to maintain total protein captured in milk and body gain when fed less protein varied considerably and the variation was mostly explained by a cow's captured protein per kilogram of metabolic body weight when fed HP, her parity, treatment sequence, and experiment. Protein efficiency was moderately repeatable across diets within lactation stage. Milk urea nitrogen was not associated with protein efficiency in individual cows within a diet and lactation stage. Cows with greater dietary protein resiliency (higher LPR) had similar protein efficiency on the HP diet as cows with lower LPR, but higher protein efficiency on the LP diet. In conclusion, cows generally maintained their protein efficiency rankings when switching diets between sufficient or insufficient protein; however, some high-producing cows are better able to maintain high production when fed less protein. We define this ability as LPR and suggest it might be useful for identifying cows that use protein more efficiently to enhance dairy sustainability.",

High-protein low-carbohydrate (HPLC) diets have been recommended for weight management for humans and pets. Gut microbes can influence the host's health and metabolism. Less is known about feline gut microbiomes compared to other species. Thirty-nine lean (LN) and OW domestic short-haired cats (median age, 7.2 years) with median body fat of 15.8 and 32.5%, respectively, were enrolled in a two-phase study. All cats were fed the control diet (CON) with 32.4% protein and 32.3% carbohydrate for 8 weeks followed by another 8 weeks of intervention where half of the cats continued the CON diet while the other half were switched to a HPLC diet with 51.4% protein and 11.6% carbohydrate. The goal was to understand how the HPLC diet influenced gut microbiota in obese vs. lean cats. The 16S rRNA gene profiling study revealed a significant impact on gut microbiome by dietary protein and carbohydrate ratio. The effect was more pronounced in OW cats than LN cats. While no microbial taxon was different between groups in LN cats, compositional changes occurred at different taxonomical ranks in OW cats. At the phylum level, Fusobacteria became more abundant in HPLC-fed cats than in CON-fed cats. At the genus level, five short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers had altered compositions in response to the diets: Faecalibacterium and Fusobacterium are more abundant in HPLC-fed cats while the abundances of Megasphaera, Bifidobacterium, and Veillonella increased in CON-fed cats. Predicted microbial gene networks showed changes in energy metabolism and one-carbon metabolism pathways. Our study demonstrated differential responses to HPLC diet between obese vs. lean cats and opportunities to explore these SCFA-producers for weight management in cats."

The aim of this study was to determine the 6 and 12 month effectiveness of blended (e-health + coaching) home-based exercise and a dietary protein intervention on physical performance in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: This cluster randomized controlled trial allocated 45 clusters of older adults already engaged in a weekly community-based exercise programme. The clusters were randomized to three groups with ratio of 16:15:14; (i) no intervention, control (CON); (ii) blended home-based exercise intervention (HBex); and (iii) HBex with dietary protein counselling (HBex-Pro). Both interventions used a tablet PC with app and personalized coaching and were targeting on behaviour change. The study comprised coached 6 month interventions with a 6 month follow-up. The primary outcome physical performance was assessed by modified Physical Performance Test (m-PPT). Secondary outcomes were gait speed, physical activity level (PAL), handgrip muscle strength, protein intake, skeletal muscle mass, health status, and executive functioning. Linear mixed models of repeated measured were used to assess intervention effects at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The population included 245 older adults (mean age 72 ± 6.5 (SD) years), 71% female, and 54% co-morbidities observed. Dropout of the intervention was 18% at 6 months and 26% at 12 months. Participants were well functioning, based on an m-PPT score of 33.9 (2.8) out of 36. For the primary outcome m-PPT, no significant intervention effects (HBex, +0.03, P = 0.933; HBex-Pro, -0.13, P = 0.730) were found. Gait speed (+0.20 m/s, P = 0.001), PAL (+0.06, P = 0.008), muscle strength (+2.32 kg, P = 0.001), protein intake (+0.32 g/kg/day, P < 0.001), and muscle mass (+0.33 kg, P = 0.017) improved significantly in the HBex-Pro group compared with control group after 6 month intervention.

Health change and executive functioning improved significantly in both intervention groups after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This HBex and dietary protein interventions did not change the physical performance (m-PPT) in community-dwelling older adults. Changes were observed in gait speed, PAL, muscle mass, strength, and dietary protein intake, in response to this combined intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) is an anabolic hormone that stimulates cell growth and division. The effects of IGF-1 may be beneficial (muscle growth/repair) or detrimental (increased risk of several types of cancer and mortality) for health. Dietary protein and physical activity are thought to be factors that modulate IGF-1. OBJECTIVE: This study analysed the relationships dietary protein vs IGF-1 and physical activity vs IGF-1 independently with a large sample size, and determined if/how physical activity affected the association between dietary protein and IGF-1 in healthy adults. METHODS: Regression models were used to assess the association between dietary protein and/or physical activity on serum IGF-1 in a cross-sectional sample of 60,677 healthy adults that were enrolled in the UK Biobank project. RESULTS: Dietary protein was positively associated with IGF-1 (0.030 nmol/L;95%CI 0.027-0.033;p < 0.001). Individuals undertaking 10-50 excess MET h/week of physical activity had 0.129 nmol/L greater IGF-1 than participants completing less than 10 excess MET h/week (95%CI 0.028-0.230). The \"high\" category of physical activity (>50 excess MET h/week) was not correlated with IGF-1 (-0.055 nmol/L;95%CI -0.185-0.076). When dietary protein and physical activity were included in the same model, physical activity did not change the relationship between dietary protein and IGF-1, nor visa-versa. CONCLUSIONS: The positive association between dietary protein and IGF-1 was not influenced by physical activity. The former association was stronger than the latter. Thus, when seeking to adjust IGF-1 for possible health concerns, regulating dietary protein may be more pertinent than physical activity as a primary intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sarcopenia is defined as a syndrome characterized by declines in skeletal muscle mass and strength or an alteration in physical function. Although some studies showed nutritional supplementation alone might have health benefits for older sarcopenic patients, their results were inconsistent and remain controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a diet with high protein supplementation (Supp) can lead to better improvement than additional protein intake via dietary counseling (Diet) in maintaining the muscle mass and strength among sarcopenic elders. METHODS: This was an open-label, parallel-group (Supp vs. Diet) trial. In total, 56 sarcopenic elders completed this study. All subjects were advised to achieve adequate protein intake (1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight/day). This amount of protein is recommended for the elderly and is thought to prevent or retard muscle loss due to aging. The diet group (n = 28) was recommended to consume an ordinary protein-rich diet via counselling whereas the Supp group (n = 28) received a vitamin D- and leucine-enriched whey protein supplement for 12 weeks. The appendicular muscle mass index (AMMI), handgrip strength, gait speed, and calorie and macronutrients intake were evaluated after 4 and 12 weeks of the diet intervention. RESULTS: Total energy and protein intake increased in both groups. The Supp group had higher intake than the Diet group. The AMMI increased in both groups, and handgrip strength improved in the Diet group. However, no significant differences in AMMI or handgrip strength were found between the two groups. Compared to the Diet group, the Supp group had better improvement in gait speed after 12 weeks of the supplement intervention especially in subjects younger than 75 years. CONCLUSIONS: The AMMI can be improved as long as sufficient protein is consumed (1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight/day) in sarcopenic elders. Nutritional supplement allows the sarcopenic elderly to more conveniently meet their protein requirements. Supplementation with whey protein and vitamin D can further improve gait speed in elderly sarcopenic subjects, especially in the \"younger\" age group.
