      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of pyritinol in improving the neurodevelopmental outcome at one year of age among term babies with post-asphyxial encephalopathy. SETTING: Level II Neonatal Nursery and Child Development Centre, Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. DESIGN: Randomised placebo controlled double blind trial. PARTICIPANTS: 108 term babies with post-asphyxial encephalopathy, stratified into three grades based on clinical criteria. INTERVENTION: The treatment group (n=54) received pyritinol and the control group (n=54) received placebo, in exactly the same increasing dosage schedule of 1 to 5 mL liquid drug (20-100 mg) from 8th postnatal day until the end of six months. OUTCOME VARIABLES: Mean Mental Development Index (MDI) and mean Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) measured on Bayley Scales of Infant Development at one year of age. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in MDI or PDI scores at one year between the treatment and control groups. The confidence interval for the differences ranged from -6.3 to 8.7 for MDI and from - 4.1 to 12.7 for PDI. On multiple regression analysis using one year MDI and PDI scores, even after controlling for birthweight, there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSION: Pyritinol is not useful in improving the neurodevelopmental status of babies with post-asphyxial encephalopathy at one year of age.",

      "abstract": "70 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were randomly allocated to four groups: 17 patients received only social support, 18 cognitive training twice a week, in 17 cognitive training was combined with pyritinol 2 x 600 mg/day and in 18 cognitive training was combined with phosphatidylserine 2 x 200 mg/day. Treatment duration was 6 months. Before and after treatment, the patients underwent neuropsychological testing as well as measurement of the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose using positron emission tomography and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Before treatment the groups were comparable in respect to resting and activated glucose pattern achieved by a visual recognition task. Electrophysiological changes were assessed as EEG power, globally and in 4 frequency bands. This 6-month study in four groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease indicated that phosphatidylserine treatment has an effect on different measures of brain function. Since neuropsychological improvements were best documented after 8 and 16 weeks and faded towards the end of the treatment period, it must be concluded that this symptomatic therapy is mainly of short-term benefit and was overcome by the progressive pathological changes at the end of the treatment period.",

Patients with RA received 600 mg/day PY or 6 mg/day AU for 1 year. Response was rated by a defined improvement in at least four of the following: Ritchie index, joint swelling index, rating scales for pain and general well-being, functional index, morning stiffness, ESR. Of the 139 fully evaluable PY patients 61 (44%) dropped out due to adverse events or response failure compared with 44 (31%) of the 142 AU patients. In patients treated for 1 year efficacy parameters improved more in the PY than in the AU group, with significant differences for the general well-being (P = 0.022), ESR (P = 0.029) and haemoglobin (P = 0.0042). The response rate for PY (61/78 patients, 78%) was significantly superior to AU (58/98 patients, 59% P = 0.009). An intention-to-treat analysis corroborated this result (P = 0.030). Adverse events (AE) occurred in 64% of PY patients and in 58% of AU patients: main AE were mucocutaneous symptoms (PY 36%, AU 23%) and gastrointestinal complaints (PY 30% AU 37%). Single cases of proteinuria, hepatic and haematological abnormalities were noted in both groups.",

      "abstract": "The effect of pyritinol, a commonly used nootropic drug, on receptor properties and function was investigated in different neuronal systems, possibly associated with age-related decline in brain function. Chronic treatment (15 days) of aged (22 months) female NMRI mice with pyritinol (200 mg/kg) restored the reduced density of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the aged mouse brain. Furthermore, the total number of binding sites of the alpha 2-receptor ([3H]yohimbine binding) decreased after treatment with drug, while the number of high-affinity agonist binding sites ([3H]UK 14304 binding) was not changed. In both systems, receptor affinity was not influenced. The densities of other receptors investigated (muscarinic-cholinergic, benzodiazepine and beta-adrenergic) were not altered by treatment with pyritinol. Additionally, the effect of pyritinol on phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism was investigated in dissociated neurones from young and aged mice. Muscarinic-cholinergic induced accumulation of phosphatidylinositol and the inositol phosphate response due to activation of G-protein by fluoride was increased in aged animals, treated with drug. The inositolphosphate response after stimulation with pilocarpine was slightly but not significantly increased. The metabolism of phosphatidylinositol in young animals was not altered by treatment with drug. These results support the hypothesis of a nootropic-mediated restoration of age-related brain deficits. Changes caused by pyritinol may be due to beneficial effects on age-related alterations of the properties of the neuronal membrane.",

Histopathologic findings were consistent with erythema multiforme. Skin lesions and headache cleared after withdrawal of the drug. According to neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, the headache may have resulted from a slight, pyritinol-induced vasculitis. Previous reports on severe pyritinol-induced side effects and possible pathogenetic mechanisms are reviewed. Since pyritinol cannot be considered as an essential drug for cerebral concussion, adverse effects as described here raise doubts as to its general use in the given indication.",

      "abstract": "The extent and duration of acute disturbances of consciousness depend on the severity and localization of the underlying cerebral dysfunction. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) permits a relevant statement to be made on the course and recovery tendency of functional damage patterns in cerebral, mesencephalic, and brain stem structures. Therapy is directed at exerting a beneficial effect on the disturbed cerebral metabolism by administration of centrally active substances and at utilizing the available reserve plasticity of the brain for any possible recovery of mental performance. The bioavailability and profile of action of pyritinol have been well documented in animal experiments. We have studied the question as to the extent to which the substance influences the depth of coma in patients receiving acute intensive care therapy, and how this can be objectified electrophysiologically in the form of a specific central effect on basal brain structures. In a phase-II pilot study over five days the acute effect of intravenous 60-min. administration of 1,000 mg pyritinol on the depth of coma, the central conduction time (CCT) and the primary complex amplitude (N20/P25) of the SSEP, and on vigilance behavior (spectral edge frequencies and power) was investigated for 90 minutes in each case under intensive-medical steady-state conditions in 10 comatose patients. Because of the differences in the underlying brain damage, the primary depth of coma, age (30-89 years), sex (two female, eight male), as well as previous treatment (surgery, conservative), the significance of the results could not be evaluated by confirmatory statistical analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of 164 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 156 completed the trial. Allocation of the patients to the Senile Dementia of the Alzheimer Type group or the Multi-Infarct Dementia group was based on the Hachinski Ischemic Score, computed tomography scans and electroencephalographic (EEG) findings. In a 12-week double-blind treatment phase either 200 mg pyritinol dihydrochloride-monohydrate or placebo was given 3 times daily. Confirmatory statistics included item 2 of the Clinical Global Impression, the total score of the Short Cognitive Performance Test (Syndrom Kurz Test) and the factor 'cognitive disturbances' of the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric scale. In addition, data on tolerance, of EEG brain mapping and of a responder analysis were evaluated based on descriptive statistics. The therapeutic efficacy of pyritinol was clearly demonstrated by confirmatory analysis as the drug was statistically significantly superior to placebo in all 3 target variables. The clinical relevance of the outcome was underlined by the analysis of the descriptive variables and by the convergence found at the different observation levels. The EEG mapping demonstrated significant differences between placebo and pyritinol, with the latter decreasing slow and increasing fast alpha and beta activity, which reflects improvement of vigilance. Based on the results of this trial, it can be accepted that the therapeutic effect of pyritinol is superior to placebo in patients with mild to moderate dementia of both degenerative and vascular etiology.",

Prenatal undernutrition was induced by restricting the mother's food intake. The environmental enrichment/impoverishment and the vehicle/pyritinol treatments were given during the postweaning period of the pups. The rats were subjected to original and subsequent reversal brightness discrimination learning tests in a single unit T-maze at 8-9 weeks of age. Thereafter, the animals were tested for the passive avoidance learning. The results indicate that undernutrition caused significant original discrimination learning deficits whereas environmental deprivation attenuated both the original and reversal learning performance. Environmental impoverishment attenuated the retention of passive avoidance behaviour but undernutrition had no effect on this paradigm. Pyritinol treatment improved the learning and retention performance of normally reared rats and also attenuated the original and reversal learning deficits induced by parental undernutrition and postweaning environmental impoverishment. The results indicate that pyritinol may be useful in learning and memory deficits induced by malnutrition and environmental deprivation.",

The authors report a case of spontaneous autoimmune hypoglycemia in a French woman receiving pyritinol. The difference between insulin and C peptide radioimmunoassay levels prompted a search for insulin antibodies. In vitro studies confirmed their presence and showed that they were immunoglobulins G with two binding sites without species specificity. The outcome of autoimmune hypoglycemia is usually favourable, with a rapid decrease of insulin antibodies but steroid therapy is needed when serious clinical manifestations are present. The differential diagnosis with factitious hypoglycemia may be difficult. The reasons for the appearance of the insulin antibodies and the exact mechanisms of hypoglycemia remain hypothetical. However, drugs with a sulfhydril group, such as pyritinol, could play a causative role in this syndrome.",

It is suggested that an effect of these metabolites on the membrane of nerve endings may be part of the mechanism by which pyritinol treatment increases ACH levels and release in old rats.",

Furthermore, we attempted to find some evidence for the validity of a neurophysiological vigilance model which had already been used earlier. In the previous study it had been possible to show a rise in the vigilance level in patients under pyritinol treatment. The investigation began with a two-week single-blind placebo wash-out phase and continued over a 12-week treatment period, with six weeks' treatment in a hospital ward and six weeks' outpatient treatment (or in a geriatric home within a hospital setting). Pyritinol was administered three times daily in coated tablets each containing 200 mg. The course of the trial was controlled using two rating scales (SCAG, BGP), a physician's Global Impression (GI) and two performance tests (SKT, ZVT-G). There were 13 drop-outs, four because of intercurrent diseases, nine because they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. The data of 107 patients were included in the statistical analysis, 54 on pyritinol and 53 on placebo. No notable adverse drug reactions were observed that were not similarly reported in the placebo group (Table 1). Statistically significant results were found in favor of pyritinol compared with placebo in both the level of clinical symptomatology (Fig. 1) and the performance level (Fig. 4). Particularly impressive was the superiority of pyritinol in the factor \"social behavior\" of the SCAG. Considering the clinical relevance of the changes it can be concluded that in both groups improvements occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Following a two weeks' washout phase, 50 patients were randomly allocated to two treatment groups of 25 patients each, receiving either 200 mg pyritinol three times daily, or placebo under double-blind conditions. The treatment period lasted 8 weeks. To be included in the study, patients had to have at least 50% subvigil phases in the 15-min EEG resting recording. We define such behaviour as a neurophysiological disturbance of vigilance. Scores in the Benton test were to be 2 points below the expected value, and/or the NAF score was to be above a standard value attained in an old peoples' home (greater than or equal to 14). We used this clinical pharmacological model for an internal validation of our Vigilance Index (VI). According to our definition, the Vigilance Index should express vigilance in the sense of an optimalization of the neuronal system to enable this system to perform better. The delta F power and the alpha slow-wave index have been considered as vigilance-indicative variables in the EEG. We believe that vigilance can be better expressed by a multidimensional approach, which takes into account all EEG elements that express vigilance, such as the replacement of the occipital basic rhythm (e.g. alpha or beta rhythm) into slow waves, the lowering of the dominant occipital frequency (be it an alpha or beta frequency), the anteriorization of the basic rhythm in the occipital field to the frontal region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of four acid sulphur compounds (benzenesulphonates)-ethamsylate, diethylammonium persilate, calcium dobesilate, and piperazine sultosilate--not previously screened for antiinflammatory activity, all except piperazine sultosilate inhibited the macrophages, all except calcium dobesilate stimulated the lymphocytes, and only calcium dobesilate stimulated the von Kupffer cells. Two non-acid sulphur compounds--levamisole and pyritinol hydrochloride--had no effect on the macrophages but were potent stimulants of the lymphocytes and the von Kupffer cells. Because of these immunostimulant properties, levamisole and pyritinol hydrochloride may prove useful in the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis in which the patient's immune potential has to be restored.",

      "abstract": "Pyritinol-HCl was tested for its impact on the cognitive functions of children with learning disabilities. This study is a contribution to scientific discussion on the complicated methodologic problems in evaluating the clinical efficacy of psychopharmacologic agents. Sixty-seven pupils of slow learner classes between the ages of 11 and 16 years were treated for 6 months with 300 mg pyritinol-HCl/24 hr or placebo under strict double-blind conditions. Drug intake was stimulated and controlled by means of intense psychosocial interaction with the mothers of the subjects. The dependence variables used to test medication effects were 22 parameters of cognitive performance measured in psychologic tests for perceptual and intellectual functions which were administered immediately before and after the medication phase. First the gainscores before and after treatment with pyritinol or placebo within the 22 cognitive parameters were statistically compared. In addition, an analysis of covariance on the corrected results of the second test (treating the results of first testing as covariates) and a two group discriminant analysis for overall differences were performed. None of the 22 parameters showed statistically significant treatment effects with respect to average performance (t (pyritinol - placebo) = 1.96 to 1.31), neither could the two groups be separated by discriminant analysis (Hotelling's T2 = 35.4, df - 22 and 43, P = 0.465). With respect to a variability of gainscores, however, in four parameters there was a significantly higher variance in the pyritinol group (F = 1.85-2.33, P less than 0.05, less than 0.02, respectively). This fact may signify that pyritinol-HCl had different effects on different subjects. By means of prognostic stratification we therefore attempted to define objective criteria for a selection of subjects with probable positive treatment effects. None of the 15 tested criteria, such as body weight, age, perceptual handicaps, or reduced short term memory, IQ range, proved, however, to be critical for a prognosis of pyritinol effects within the present test population.",
