      "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by widespread inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to impaired gas exchange and significant morbidity. In this study, we propose a potential approach using a magnesium-free DNA self-assembly strategy to assemble a DNA nanotube that carries agmatine and microRNA-126b mimics (NTAGM-126). Agmatine not only reduces electrostatic repulsion between DNA helices, thereby facilitating the folding of the DNA nanotube, but also serves as a drug that inhibits iNOS signaling. The microRNA-126b mimics restore the downregulated microRNA-126b in macrophages and suppress inflammation by targeting high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Preliminary results indicated that agmatine can effectively facilitate the assembly of the DNA nanotube, improve serum stability, and enhance the cellular uptake efficiency of NTAGM-126. Further in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that NTAGM-126 effectively reduces oxidative stress and inflammation by downregulating iNOS and HMGB1, providing a combined therapeutic effect in ALI. This study highlights the potential of agmatine-facilitated DNA nanostructures as a versatile drug delivery platform for treating inflammatory diseases, broadening the application of DNA nanotechnology in biomedical research. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study introduces a promising therapeutic approach using a magnesium-free DNA self-assembly strategy to create a DNA nanotube (NTAGM-126) that carries agmatine and microRNA-126b mimics. The agmatine not only aids in the assembly and stability of the DNA nanotube but also inhibits iNOS signaling, while the microRNA-126b mimics restore downregulated microRNA-126b in macrophages and suppress inflammation by targeting HMGB1. Preliminary and further results demonstrate that NTAGM-126 effectively reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, providing a combined therapeutic effect in ALI. This study underscores the potential of agmatine-facilitated DNA nanostructures as a versatile drug delivery platform, broadening the application of DNA nanotechnology in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and advancing biomedical research."

      "abstract": "Agmatine is a naturally occurring biogenic amine that acts primarily as an inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Previous studies have shown that both acute and chronic agmatine administration induced anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects in rodents. In the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), nitric oxide (NO) donors inhibit serotonergic (5-HT) neuronal activity, with the nNOS-expressing 5-HT neurons showing lower baseline firing rates than the non-nNOS expressing neurons. Our study aimed to test the hypothesis that the psychoactive effects of agmatine are mediated, at least in part, via a mechanism involving the stimulation of the DRN 5-HT neurons, as well as to assess the molecular pathway allowing agmatine to modulate the excitability of 5-HT neurons. Using extracellular in vivo electrophysiology, we demonstrated that both acute (1-3 mg/kg, i.v.) and chronic (40 mg/kg/day, i.p., 14 days) agmatine administration significantly increased the firing rate of DRN 5-HT neurons. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that chronic agmatine treatment selectively upregulated the expression of serotonin-1B (5-HT1B) and serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor mRNA in the DRN. Previous studies have shown that DRN 5-HT2A receptor activation stimulates 5-HT neurons and produces antidepressant-like effects; our findings suggest that agmatine's excitatory effect on DRN 5-HT neurons may be partially 5-HT2A receptor-dependent. Given that modulation of the 5-HT neuronal firing activity is critical for the proper antidepressant efficacy, nNOS inhibitors can be potential antidepressants by their own and/or effective adjuncts to other antidepressant drugs.",

We drafted this research to define the results of combining agmatine and melatonin on stress-induced depression in mice. METHODS: Experimental groups included the non-stressed group treated with vehicle (ethanol at a concentration of 0.0005%), stressed vehicle (ethanol at a concentration of 0.0005%)-treated group, group treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day), group treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg/day), group treated with agmatine (1 mg/kg/day), group receiving a combination of melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) and agmatine (1 mg/kg/day). The animals were subjected to restraint stress for two hours daily for a duration of one week, concurrently with the daily oral administration of agents through drinking water. Open field test and forced swimming test were operated on the 8th day. The oxidative stress markers were measured in the mice hippocampus. RESULTS: Stress led to the elevation of immobility time. The combination group showed a significant effect in comparison to the agmatine and melatonin groups. The combination of melatonin and agmatine was successful in the elevation of hippocampus catalase activity; and this effect was comparable in the fluoxetine group. We observed enhancement of superoxide dismutase activity in treatment groups and reduction in malondialdehyde levels in melatonin, agmatine and combination groups. CONCLUSION: A combination of agmatine and melatonin improves stress-induced depression more effectively than each alone, which may result from suppressing oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, driving neuronal degeneration through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, impaired energy production, and dysregulated calcium homeostasis. Agmatine, an endogenous polyamine derived from arginine, has garnered attention for its neuroprotective properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and antiapoptotic effects. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of agmatine in preserving mitochondrial function and mitigating neurodegeneration, making it a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention. One of the key mechanisms by which agmatine exerts its neuroprotective effects is through the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Agmatine has been shown to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, promoting mitochondrial fusion and fission balance essential for cellular energy metabolism and signaling. Moreover, agmatine acts as a regulator of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, preventing excessive calcium influx and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite promising findings, challenges such as optimizing agmatine's pharmacokinetics, determining optimal dosing regimens, and elucidating its precise molecular targets within mitochondria remain to be addressed. Future research directions should focus on developing targeted delivery systems for agmatine, investigating its interactions with mitochondrial proteins, and conducting well-designed clinical trials to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy and safety profile in neurodegenerative disorders. Overall, agmatine emerges as a novel therapeutic agent with the potential to modulate mitochondrial homeostasis and alleviate neurodegenerative pathology, offering new avenues for treating these debilitating conditions.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Essential tremor (ET) is a prevalent movement disorder, yet current therapeutic options remain limited. Emerging evidence implicates leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing protein (Lingo-1) and neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of ET. This study aimed to investigate whether agmatine, a biogenic amine neuromodulator attenuates tremors and modulates the expression of Lingo-1 and proinflammatory markers in a rodent model of ET. METHODS: Tremor was induced in male Swiss Webster mice through intraperitoneal injections of harmaline (10 mg/kg) on Days 1, 3, and 5 of the study. During the same period, agmatine (40 mg/kg) was administered for 5 consecutive days. Behavioral assessments of tremor severity, gait, balance, muscular strength, locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and memory were conducted. Moreover, Lingo-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression was examined in the cerebellum using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). FINDINGS: Our findings demonstrated that agmatine administration significantly reduced tremors, ameliorated anxiety-like behaviors, and attenuated harmaline-induced locomotor deficits. At the molecular level, agmatine treatment significantly suppressed the overexpression of Lingo-1 elicited by harmaline. Moreover, IL-6 expression was attenuated to an extent comparable to control levels. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study provides the first evidence that agmatine dampens tremor severity, improves behavioral outcomes, and modulates key pathways implicated in ET pathogenesis in a rodent model. The ability of agmatine to normalize Lingo-1 and IL-6 expression suggests regulation of these pathways could underlie its neuroprotective action. These results suggest promise for agmatine as a prospective therapeutic agent in ET.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of agmatine on reducing mortality, neurobehavioral alterations, infarct size, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice subjected to bilateral carotid thrombosis. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, the left common carotid artery was exposed to 6% FeCl3. Thirty-two days later, the same procedure was performed on the right common carotid artery. Subsequently, Agmatine (100 mg/kg) was administered 15 min after the second procedure, and in another experimental group, the dose of Agmatine was repeated at 72 h. Administration of agmatine extended survival in ischemic animals up to 72 h for the single-dose group and up to 96 h for the repeated-dose group, without significant increases in neurological deficits or infarct area size. This neurobehavioral effect was also observed in sham animals treated with agmatine. In ischemic animals, agmatine administration improved digging behavior and reduced recovery times, consistently shorter in those animals treated with repeated doses. RT-PCR analyses revealed a positive regulation of the cytokine IL-1β in agmatine-treated animals, which has been associated with recovery stages. The results suggest that the observed effect may be attributed to the multiple interactions of agmatine with ischemic cascade events, highlighting its anti-inflammatory role.",

      "abstract": "Isoproterenol (ISO) usage is limited by its potential for cardiotoxicity. We sought to investigate the potential of agmatine in mitigating ISO-induced cardiotoxicity. Agmatine (100 mg/kg/day) was intraperitoneally administered to Wistar rats for 7 days in the presence or absence of cardiotoxicity induced by subcutaneous injection of ISO (85 mg/kg) on the sixth and seventh days. ECG parameters, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) were investigated. Changes in cardiac tissue were also investigated using H&E staining. The heart weight/body weight ratio increased in ISO-treated rats. In the agmatine + ISO group, the increased heart rate observed in ISO-treated rats was reversed (317.2 ± 10.5 vs 452.2 ± 10.61, P < 0.001). Agmatine ameliorated the change in PR, RR, and ST intervals and the QRS complex, which was reduced by ISO. Treatment with saline, ISO, and agmatine had no significant effect on papillary muscle stimulation (P > 0.05). The administration of agmatine to ISO-receiving group could mitigate several parameters when compared to ISO-receiving group including increasing papillary muscle contraction (0.83 vs 0.71 N/M2 respectively, P < 0.01), decreasing LDH levels (660 ng/ml vs 1080 ng/ml, respectively, P < 0.05), decreasing CPK levels (377 U/l vs 642 U/l, respectively, P < 0.05) and decreasing MDA levels (20.32 µM/l vs 46.83 µM/l, P < 0.001). Coadministration of agmatine and ISO is capable of ameliorating ISO cardiotoxicity by antioxidant effects and controlling the hemostasis of calcium in myocytes.",

      "abstract": "Agmatine, an endogenous polyamine generated by the gut microbiota, positively affects host lifespan by regulating mononuclear cell or macrophage function. Although the regulatory pathways governing monocyte/macrophage differentiation have been well studied, the influence of the microbiome and its metabolites on monocyte/macrophage function have not been fully elucidated. To address this, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms whereby agmatine inhibits immunometabolic disorders using the colon of ulcerative colitis (UC) model mice. Agmatine (10 mM) attenuated pathological damage to colonic tissue and significantly improved the survival rate of UC model mice. In particular, treatment of UC model mice with 0.4, 2, and 10 mM agmatine resulted in mortality rates of 70 %, 20 %, 10 %, and 0 %, respectively. In a macrophage-depletion model, agmatine regulated the inflammatory microenvironment by affecting macrophages: it reduced the proportion of M1 macrophages and increased that of M2 macrophages in UC model mice. In cultured macrophages, agmatine inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cytokine and NO secretion, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the Griess assay, respectively. Agmatine partially reduced inflammatory factor production by inhibiting histone deacetylase, as detected by fluorometric assay. These findings provide evidence that agmatine efficiently suppresses macrophage polarization in UC mice, highlighting its potential as an anti-inflammatory agent against UC.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a global health concern affecting nearly 280 million individuals. It not only imposes a significant burden on economies and healthcare systems but also manifests complex physiological connections and consequences. Agmatine, a putative neuromodulator derived primarily from beneficial gut microbes specially Lactobacillus, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for mental health. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is involved in the development of depression through the peripheral nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system and may be a key factor in the effect of agmatine. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of agmatine in antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and depression-like behavior in rats, focusing on its modulation of the gut-brain axis. Depression-like behavior associated with dysbiosis was induced through a seven-day regimen of the broad-spectrum antibiotic, comprising ampicillin and metronidazole and validated through microbial, biochemical, and behavioral alterations. On day 8, antibiotic-treated rats exhibited loose fecal consistency, altered fecal microbiota, and depression-like behavior in forced swim test. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated, while agmatine and monoamine levels decreased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Antibiotic administration disrupted tight junction proteins in the ileum, affecting gut architecture. Oral administration of agmatine alone or combined with probiotics significantly reversed antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, restoring gut microbiota and mitigating depression-like behaviors. This intervention also restored neuro-inflammatory markers, increased agmatine and monoamine levels, and preserved gut integrity. The study highlights the regulatory role of endogenous agmatine in the gut-brain axis in broad-spectrum antibiotic induced dysbiosis and associated depression-like behavior.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and epilepsy and the psychological and socio-economic implications that are associated with their treatments can be quite perplexing. Metformin is an antihyperglycemic medication that is used to treat type 2 DM. In addition, metformin elicits protective actions against multiple diseases, including neurodegeneration and epilepsy. Recent studies indicate that metformin alters the resident gut microbiota in favor of species producing agmatine, an arginine metabolite which, in addition to beneficially altering metabolic pathways, is a potent neuroprotectant and neuromodulant. METHODS: We first examine the literature for epidemiological and clinical evidences linking DM and epilepsy. Next, basing our analyses on published literature, we propose the possible complementarity of agmatine and metformin in the treatment of DM and epilepsy. RESULTS: Our analyses of the clinical data suggest a significant association between pathogeneses of epilepsy and DM. Further, both agmatine and metformin appear to be multimodal therapeutic agents and have robust antiepileptogenic and antidiabetic properties. Data from animal and clinical studies largely support the use of metformin/agmatine as a double-edged pharmacotherapeutic agent against DM and epilepsy, particularly in their concurrent pathological occurrences. CONCLUSION: The present review explores the evidences and available data on possible uses of metformin/agmatine as pertinent antidiabetic and antiepileptic agents. Our hope is that this will stimulate further research on the therapeutic actions of these multimodal agents, particularly for subject-specific clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC), a malignant tumor worldwide, is associated with gut microbiota. The influence of gut microbe-derived metabolites on CRC has attracted a lot of attention. However, the role of immunity mediated by commensal microbiota-derived metabolites in tumorigenesis of CRC is not intensively explored. Here we monitored the gut microbial dysbiosis in CRC mouse model (ApcMin/+ model) without dietary and pharmacological intervention, followed by characterized of metabolites enriched in CRC model mice. Profound changes of gut microbiome (bacteriome) were observed during intestinal disorders. Metabolomic profiling indicated that agmatine, derived from the gut bacteria i.e. Blautia, Odoribacter, Alistipes and Paraprevotella, could interact with Rnf128 to suppress the Rnf128-mediated ubiquitination of β-catenin to further upregulate the downstream targets of β-catenin including Cyclin D1, Lgr5, CD44 and C-myc, thus activating Wnt signaling. The activated Wnt signaling pathway promoted dysplasia of intestinal cells and inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes via inducing the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), thereby contributing to colorectal carcinogenesis. Therefore, our study presented novel insights into the roles and mechanisms of gut microbiota in pathogenesis of CRC.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the role of agmatine in the neurobiology underlying memory impairment during ethanol withdrawal in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 21-day chronic ethanol exposure regimen (2.4 % w/v ethanol for 3 days, 4.8 % w/v for the next 4 days, and 7.2 % w/v for the following 14 days), followed by a withdrawal period. Memory impairment was assessed using the passive avoidance test (PAT) at 24, 48, and 72 h post-withdrawal. The ethanol-withdrawn rats displayed a significant decrease in step-through latency in the PAT, indicative of memory impairment at 72 h post-withdrawal. However, administration of agmatine (40 µg/rat) and its modulators (L-arginine, arcaine, and amino-guanidine) significantly increases the latency time in the ethanol-withdrawn rats, demonstrating the attenuation of memory impairment. Further, pretreatment with imidazoline receptor agonists enhances agmatine's effects, while antagonists block them, implicating imidazoline receptors in agmatine's actions. Neurochemical analysis in ethanol-withdrawn rats reveals dysregulated glutamate and GABA levels, which was attenuated by agmatine and its modulators. By examining the effects of agmatine administration and modulators of endogenous agmatine, the study aimed to shed light on the potential therapeutic implications of agmatinergic signaling in alcohol addiction and related cognitive deficits. Thus, the present findings suggest that agmatine administration and modulation of endogenous agmatine levels hold potential as therapeutic strategies for managing alcohol addiction and associated cognitive deficits. Understanding the neurobiology underlying these effects paves the way for the development of novel interventions targeting agmatinergic signaling in addiction treatment.",

      "abstract": "Agmatine, a naturally occurring polyamine derived from arginine via arginine decarboxylase, has been shown to play multifaceted roles in the mammalian body, impacting a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. This comprehensive review delineates the significant insights into agmatine's pharmacological profile, emphasizing its structure and metabolism, neurotransmission and regulation, and pharmacokinetics and function. Agmatine's biosynthesis is highly conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular functions. In the brain, comparable to established neurotransmitters, agmatine acts as a neuromodulator, influencing the regulation, metabolism, and reabsorption of neurotransmitters that are key to mood disorders, learning, cognition, and the management of anxiety and depression. Beyond its neuromodulatory functions, agmatine exhibits protective effects across various cellular and systemic contexts, including neuroprotection, nephroprotection, cardioprotection, and cytoprotection, suggesting a broad therapeutic potential. The review explores agmatine's interaction with multiple receptor systems, including NMDA, α2-adrenoceptors, and imidazoline receptors, elucidating its role in enhancing cell viability, neuronal protection, and synaptic plasticity. Such interactions underpin agmatine's potential in treating neurological diseases and mood disorders, among other conditions. Furthermore, agmatine's pharmacokinetics, including its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, are discussed, underlining the complexity of its action and the potential for therapeutic application. The safety and efficacy of agmatine supplementation, demonstrated through various animal and human studies, affirm its potential as a beneficial therapeutic agent. Conclusively, the diverse physiological and therapeutic effects of agmatine, spanning neurotransmission, protection against cellular damage, and modulation of various receptor pathways, position it as a promising candidate for further research and clinical application. This review underscores the imperative for continued exploration into agmatine's mechanisms of action and its potential in pharmacology and medicine, promising advances in the treatment of numerous conditions.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and a significant societal burden. Despite extensive research and efforts of the multidisciplinary scientific community, to date, there is no cure for this debilitating disease. Moreover, the existing pharmacotherapy for AD only provides symptomatic support and does not modify the course of the illness or halt the disease progression. This is a significant limitation as the underlying pathology of the disease continues to progress leading to the deterioration of cognitive functions over time. In this milieu, there is a growing need for the development of new and more efficacious treatments for AD. Agmatine, a naturally occurring molecule derived from L-arginine, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for AD. Besides this, agmatine has been shown to modulate amyloid beta (Aβ) production, aggregation, and clearance, key processes implicated in AD pathogenesis. It also exerts neuroprotective effects, modulates neurotransmitter systems, enhances synaptic plasticity, and stimulates neurogenesis. Furthermore, preclinical and clinical studies have provided evidence supporting the cognition-enhancing effects of agmatine in AD. Therefore, this review article explores the promising role of agmatine in AD pathology and cognitive function. However, several limitations and challenges exist, including the need for large-scale clinical trials, optimal dosing, and treatment duration. Future research should focus on mechanistic investigations, biomarker studies, and personalized medicine approaches to fully understand and optimize the therapeutic potential of agmatine. Augmenting the use of agmatine may offer a novel approach to address the unmet medical need in AD and provide cognitive enhancement and disease modification for individuals affected by this disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute pancreatitis which is characterized by pancreatic inflammation can sometimes be difficult to treat because of limited therapeutic options. The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of agmatine in the acute pancreatitis experimental rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An acute pancreatitis model was created with the administration of cerulein in 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats. Agmatine was administered as a protective agent at 5 mg/kg (low dose) and 10 mg/kg (high dose). The rats were divided into 5 groups, each with 8 rats: group 1 (acute pancreatitis); group 2 (acute pancreatitis+low-dose agmatine 5 mg/kg); group 3 (acute pancreatitis+high-dose agmatine 10 mg/kg); group 4 (placebo, acute pancreatitis+saline); and group 5 (sham and saline infusion). All rats were sacrificed 24 hours after the last injection, and the levels of superoxide dismutase, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were assessed in blood samples collected via cardiac puncture. Histopathological examination was performed by a pathologist, who was blind to the groups, according to the Schoenberg's pancreatitis scoring index. RESULTS: The amylase (16.67 and 37.89 U/L), glutathione peroxidase (13.62 and 18.44 ng/mL), tumor necrosis factor-α (39.68 and 64 ng/mL), interleukin-1 (484.73 and 561.83 pg/mL), and transforming growth factor-β (110.52 and 126.34 ng/L) levels were significantly lower and superoxide dismutase (1.29 and 0.98 ng/L) and malondialdehyde (0.99 and 0.96 nmol/mL) levels were significantly higher in group 3 compared to group 1 (P < .05). Moreover glutathione peroxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β levels were lower, and malondialdehyde levels were higher in the group 3 compared to group 2 (P < .05). Although the Schoenberg's pancreatitis scoring index was not significantly different between the high- and low-dose treatment groups, rats who received high-dose treatment had significantly lower scores compared to those with acute pancreatitis group. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that evaluated the efficacy of agmatine in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis. Agmatine, an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, had a protective effect in an experimental rat model of acute pancreatitis.",

However, a definitive cure for this devastating disorder remains elusive. Agmatine, a biogenic amine, has gain attention for its reported neuromodulatory and neuroprotective properties. The present study was designed to examine the influence of agmatine on the behavioral, biochemical, and molecular aspects of HD in an animal model. A mitochondrial toxin, 3-nitro propionic acid (3-NP), was used to induce HD phenotype and similar symptoms such as motor incoordination, memory impairment, neuro-inflammation, and depressive-like behavior in rats. Rats were pre-treated with 3-NP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 and then continued on agmatine treatment (5 - 20 µg/rat, i.c.v.) from day-8 to day-27 of the treatment protocol. 3-NP-induced cognitive impairment was associated with declined in agmatine levels within prefrontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Further, the 3-NP-treated rats showed an increase in IL-6 and TNF-α and a reduction in BDNF immunocontent within these brain areas. Agmatine treatment not only improved the 3-NP-induced motor incoordination, depression-like behavior, rota-rod performance, and learning and memory impairment but also normalized the GABA/glutamate, BDNF, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in discrete brain areas. Similarly, various agmatine modulators, which increase the endogenous agmatine levels in the brain, such as L-arginine (biosynthetic precursor), aminoguanidine (diamine oxidase inhibitor), and arcaine (agmatinase inhibitor) also demonstrated similar effects exhibiting the importance of endogenous agmatinergic pathway in the pathogenesis of 3-NP-induced HD like symptoms. The present study proposed the possible role of agmatine in the pathogenesis and treatment of HD associated motor incoordination, and psychiatric and cognitive complications.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: VPA was injected intraperitoneally on embryonic days (ED) 12.5, and the pregnant rats were gavaged with agmatine between E6.5 to E18.5 (13 days), at doses of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg. The autism-like behaviors and memory of male pups were analyzed via open-field, three-chamber, and novel object recognition tests. Serum oxidative stress and the histological changes in the PFC and CA1 were assessed at the end of the study. RESULTS: The results suggest that prenatal agmatine reduced autistic-like behaviors by decreasing cell loss in CA1 and PFC. We observed no alterations in superoxide dismutase (SOD) level and total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) between groups. VPA decreased catalase (CAT) activities, while agmatine decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) activity. CONCLUSION: Overall, this investigation suggests that agmatine may be a potential candidate for the early treatment and even prevention of appearance of autism symptoms."

      "abstract": "Agmatine, an endogenous polyamine, has been shown to reduce chronic pain behaviors in animal models and in patients. This reduction is due to inhibition of the GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in the central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of action requires central activity, but the extent to which agmatine crosses biologic barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and intestinal epithelium is incompletely understood. Determination of agmatine distribution is limited by analytical protocols with low sensitivity and/or inefficient preparation. This study validated a novel bioanalytical protocol using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for quantification of agmatine in rat biologic matrices. These protocols were then used to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of agmatine and the extent of distribution to the CNS. Precision and accuracy of the protocol met US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards in surrogate matrix as well as in corrected concentrations in appropriate matrices. The protocol also adequately withstood stability and dilution conditions. Upon application of this protocol to pharmacokinetic study, intravenous agmatine showed a half-life in plasma ranging between 18.9 and 14.9 minutes. Oral administration led to a prolonged plasma half-life (74.4-117 minutes), suggesting flip-flop kinetics, with bioavailability determined to be 29%-35%. Intravenous administration led to a rapid increase in agmatine concentration in brain but a delayed distribution and lower concentrations in spinal cord. However, half-life of agmatine in both tissues is substantially longer than in plasma. These data suggest that agmatine adequately crosses biologic barriers in rat and that brain and spinal cord pharmacokinetics can be functionally distinct. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Agmatine has been shown to be an effective nonopioid therapy for chronic pain, a significantly unmet medical necessity. Here, using a novel bioanalytical protocol for quantification of agmatine, we present the plasma pharmacokinetics and the first report of agmatine oral bioavailability as well as variable pharmacokinetics across different central nervous system tissues. These data provide a distributional rationale for the pharmacological effects of agmatine as well as new evidence for kinetic differences between brain and spinal cord.",

We replaced cholesterol with AG-Chol in preparing doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) liposomes by using an active loading method for DOX. We assessed the physical and chemical properties of the resulting AG-Liposomes and evaluated their efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that AG-Liposomes were stable with high encapsulation efficiency. Compared with the control liposomes, AG-Liposomes exhibited a slower drug release rate in the release medium at pH 6.8. The in vitro cell experiments demonstrated that AG-Liposomes had higher tumor cell uptake rate, stronger migration inhibition rate, higher apoptosis rate, better anti-clonogenic ability, and higher lysosome escape ability than the control liposomes. In vivo distribution results demonstrate that liposomes prepared with AG-Chol instead of cholesterol can significantly enhance their tumor targeting abilities and reduce their distribution to non-targeted sites. In vivo tumor suppression experiments showed that AG-Liposomes had a higher tumor suppression rate than the control liposomes without causing apparent toxicity to normal tissues, as evidenced by histological staining. Therefore, substituting cholesterol with AG-Chol in the preparation of liposomes can result in enhanced lysosome escape, improved tumor targeting, and increased efficacy of anti-tumor drugs.",

Evidence suggests the impairment of memory retrieval phase in AD. It has been shown that CaMKII-α expressing neurons are selectively reduced in the hippocampus in AD brains. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of scopolamine on the memory retrieval phase and the hippocampal CaMKII-α signaling. In addition, the effect of sub-chronic administration of agmatine against scopolamine induced memory and possible hippocampal CaMKII-α deregulation was investigated in mice. Adult male NMRI mice were administered with agmatine at the doses of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg/i.p. or saline for 11 days. Acquisition and retrieval tests of passive avoidance task were performed on days 10 and 11, respectively (30 Min following agmatine treatment). Scopolamine (1 mg/kg/i.p.) was administered once, 30 Min before retrieval test. Upon completion of the behavioral tasks, the hippocampi were isolated for western blot analysis to detect the phosphorylated and total levels of CaMKII-α and beta actin proteins. The results showed that scopolamine induced memory retrieval deficit and decreased the phosphorylated level of hippocampal CaMKII-α. Sub-chronic agmatine treatment at the dose of 40 mg/kg prevented scopolamine induced memory retrieval deficit and restored the level of hippocampal phosphorylated CaMKII-α. This study suggests that hippocampal CaMKII-α might play a role in scopolamine induced amnesia and sub-chronic agmatine prevents the impairing effect of scopolamine on the retrieval phase of memory and the phosphorylation of hippocampal CaMKII-α protein.",

      "abstract": "Prenatal stress (PS) results from a maternal experience of stressful events during pregnancy, which has been associated with an increased risk of behavioral disorders including substance abuse and anxiety in the offspring. PS is known to result in heightened dopamine release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), in part through the effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone, which directly excites dopaminergic cells. It has recently been suggested that agmatine plays a role in modulating anxiety-like behaviors. In this study, we investigated whether agmatine could reduce negative cognitive outcomes in male mice prenatally exposed to psychological/physical stress, and whether this could be associated with molecular changes in VTA. Agmatine (37.5 mg/kg) was administrated 30 min prior to PS induction in pregnant Swiss mice. Male offspring were evaluated in a series of behavioral and molecular assays. Findings demonstrated that agmatine reduced the impairment in locomotor activity induced by both psychological and physical PS. Agmatine also decreased heightened conditioned place preference to morphine seen in PS offspring. Moreover, agmatine ameliorated the anxiety-like behavior and drug-seeking behavior induced by PS in the male offspring. Molecular effects were seen in VTA as the enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced by PS in the VTA was reduced by agmatine. Behavioral tests indicate that agmatine exerts a protective effect on PS-induced impairments in male offspring, which could be due in part to agmatine-associated molecular alterations in the VTA. Taken together, our data suggest that prenatal treatment with agmatine exerts protective effect against negative consequences of PS on the development of affective circuits in the offspring.",

METHODS: The Wistar rats were divided into four groups: sham, BDL, BDL+ 40 mg/kg AGM, and BDL+ 80 mg/kg AGM. The BDL rats were treated with AGM from 2 weeks after the surgery for 4 consecutive weeks. The open field, rotarod, and wire grip tests were used to assess motor function and muscle strength. The novel object recognition test (NOR) was performed to evaluate learning and memory. Finally, blood samples were collected for the analysis of the liver markers, the animals were sacrificed, and brain tissues were removed; the CA1 regions of the hippocampus and cerebellum were processed to identify apoptosis and neuronal damage rate using caspase-3 immunocytochemistry and Nissl staining. RESULTS: The serological assay results showed that BDL severely impaired the function of the liver. Based on histochemical findings, BDL increased the neuronal damage in CA1 and Purkinje cells, whereas apoptosis was significantly observed only in the cerebellum. AGM treatment prevented the increase of serum liver enzymes, balance deficits, and neuronal damage in the brain areas. Apoptosis partially decreased by AGM, and there were no differences in the performance of animals in different groups in the NOR. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests AGM as a potential treatment candidate for HE because of its neuroprotective properties and/or its direct effects on liver function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following central nervous system (CNS) injury, the investigation for neuroinflammation is vital because of its pleiotropic role in both acute injury and long-term recovery. Agmatine (Agm) is well known for its neuroprotective effects and anti-neuroinflammatory properties. However, Agm's mechanism for neuroprotection is still unclear. We screened target proteins that bind to Agm using a protein microarray; the results showed that Agm strongly binds to interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein (IRF2BP2), which partakes in the inflammatory response. Based on these prior data, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism by which the combination of Agm and IRF2BP2 induces a neuroprotective phenotype of microglia. METHODS: To confirm the relationship between Agm and IRF2BP2 in neuroinflammation, we used microglia cell-line (BV2) and treated with lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (LPS; 20 ng/mL, 24 h) and interleukin (IL)-4 (20 ng/mL, 24 h). Although Agm bound to IRF2BP2, it failed to enhance IRF2BP2 expression in BV2. Therefore, we shifted our focus onto interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2), which is a transcription factor and interacts with IRF2BP2. RESULTS: IRF2 was highly expressed in BV2 after LPS treatment but not after IL-4 treatment. When Agm bound to IRF2BP2 following Agm treatment, the free IRF2 translocated to the nucleus of BV2. The translocated IRF2 activated the transcription of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), causing KLF4 to be induced in BV2. The expression of KLF4 increased the CD206-positive cells in BV2. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, unbound IRF2, resulting from the competitive binding of Agm to IRF2BP2, may provide neuroprotection against neuroinflammation via an anti-inflammatory mechanism of microglia involving the expression of KLF4.",

METHODS: Sprague Dawley neonatal female rats were divided into control, maternal separation (MS), MS+imipramine, and MS+agmatine groups. Rats were subjected to MS for 4 hours daily from postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 21 and pups were exposed to social isolation (SI) on PND23 for 37 days for model establishment treated with imipramine (30 mg/kg; ip) or agmatine (40 mg/kg; ip) for 15 days. In order to examine behavioral changes rats were all subjected to locomotor activity and forced swimming tests (FST). Ovaries were isolated for morphological evaluation, follicle counting and mTOR signal pathway protein expression levels were detected. RESULTS: Increased number of primordial follicles and diminished ovarian reserve in the MS groups were detected. Imipramine treatment caused diminished ovarian reserve and atretic follicle; however, agmatine treatment provided the maintenance of ovarian follicular reserve after MS. mTOR signal pathway may have an important role during rat ovarian follicular development in model of MS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that agmatine may help to protect ovarian reserve during follicular development by controlling cell growth.",

      "abstract": "Physical or psychological stress experienced by a mother during gestation is often associated with serious behavioural and cognitive deficits in newborns. Investigations of protective agents, which could prevent the adverse outcomes of prenatal stress (PS), are warranted. Agmatine is a neurotransmitter putatively involved in the physiological response to stress, and exogenous administration of agmatine has been shown to produce a variety of neuroprotective effects. In this study, we aimed to assess whether prenatal agmatine exposure could ameliorate behavioural and cognitive deficits in female offspring born to prenatally stressed mice. Pregnant Swiss Webster (SW) mice were exposed to physical or psychological stress from the 11th to 17th days of gestation. Agmatine (37.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated 30 min before the induction of stress for seven consecutive days. The pups were assessed using a variety of behavioural tests and molecular assays on postnatal days 40 to 47. Agmatine attenuated impairments in locomotor activity, anxiety-like behaviour, and drug-seeking behaviour associated with both physical and psychological PS. Furthermore, agmatine reduced PS-induced impairments in passive avoidance memory and learning. Neither PS nor agmatine treatment affected the mRNA expression level of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Taken together, our findings highlight the protective effects of prenatally administered agmatine on PS-mediated behavioural and cognitive deficits of the offspring. Future studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, which could allow for more targeted prenatal treatments.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Itch is a common symptom of many skin and systemic diseases. Identifying novel endogenous itch mediators and the downstream signaling pathways involved will contribute to the development of new strategies for the treatment of chronic itch. In the present study, we adopted behavioral testing, patch clamp recording and metabonomics analysis to investigate the role of agmatine in itch and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Behavioral analysis was used to evaluate the establishing of acute and chronic itch mice model, and to test the effects of different drugs or agents on mice itch behavior. Western blotting analysis was used to test the effect of agmatine on phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK) expression in the spinal cord. Patch clamp recording was used to determine the effect agmatine on the excitability of DRG neurons and the role of ASIC3. Finally, the metabonomics analysis was performed to detect the concentration of agmatine in the affected skin under atopic dermatitis or psoriasis conditions. RESULTS: We fused a mouse model and found that an intradermal injection of agmatine (an endogenous polyamine) into the nape of the neck or cheek induced histamine-independent scratching behavior in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the ablation of nociceptive C-fibers by resiniferatoxin (RTX) abolished agmatine-induced scratching behavior. However, agmatine-induced itch was not affected by the pharmacological inhibition of either transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) or transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1); similar results were obtained from TRPV1-/- or TRPA1-/- mice. Furthermore, agmatine-induced itch was significantly suppressed by the administration of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) inhibitors, APETx2 or amiloride. Agmatine also induced the upregulation of p-ERK in the spinal cord; this effect was inhibited by amiloride. Current clamp recording showed that the acute perfusion of agmatine reduced the rheobase and increased the number of evoked action potentials in acute dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons while amiloride reversed agmatine-induced neuronal hyperexcitability. Finally, we identified significantly higher levels of agmatine in the affected skin of a mouse model of atopic dermatitis (AD) when compared to controls, and the scratching behavior of AD mice was significantly attenuated by blocking ASIC3. DISCUSSION: Collectively, these results provide evidence that agmatine is a novel mediator of itch and induces itch via the activation of ASIC3. Targeting neuronal ASIC3 signaling may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of itch."

      "abstract": "Chronic pain remains a significant burden worldwide, and treatments are often limited by safety or efficacy. The decarboxylated form of L-arginine, agmatine, antagonizes N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, inhibits nitric oxide synthase, and reverses behavioral neuroplasticity. We hypothesized that expressing the proposed synthetic enzyme for agmatine in the sensory pathway could reduce chronic pain without motor deficits. Intrathecal delivery of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector carrying the gene for arginine decarboxylase (ADC) prevented the development of chronic neuropathic pain as induced by spared nerve injury in mice and rats and persistently reversed established hypersensitivity 266 days post-injury. Spinal long-term potentiation was inhibited by both exogenous agmatine and AAV-human ADC (hADC) vector pre-treatment but was enhanced in rats treated with anti-agmatine immunoneutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that endogenous agmatine modulates the neuroplasticity associated with chronic pain. Development of approaches to access this inhibitory control of neuroplasticity associated with chronic pain may yield important non-opioid pain-relieving options.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive responses to stressful stimuli in the environment are believed to restore homeostasis after stressful events. Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, which releases glucocorticoids (GCs) into the bloodstream. Recently, agmatine, an endogenous monoamine was discovered to have the potential as a pharmacotherapy for stress. Agmatine is released in response to certain stress conditions, especially those involving GCs, and participates in establishing homeostasis disturbed by stress following GC activation. The therapeutic potential of agmatine for the management of psychological diseases involving stress and depression is promising based on a significant amount of literature. When exogenously applied, agmatine leads to reductions in levels of GCs and counteracts stress-related morphologic, synaptic, and molecular changes. However, the exact mechanism of action by which agmatine modifies the effects resulting from stress hormone secretion is not fully understood. This review aims to present the most possible mechanisms by which agmatine reduces the harmful effects of chronic and acute stress. Several studies suggest chronic stress exposure and repeated corticosteroid treatment lower agmatine levels, contributing to stress-related symptoms. Agmatine acts as an antistress agent by activating mTOR signaling, inhibiting NMDA receptors, suppressing iNOS, and maintaining bodyweight by activating α-2adrenergic receptors. Exogenous administration that restores agmatine levels may provide protection against stress-induced changes by reducing GCs release, stimulating anti-inflammatory processes, and releasing neuroprotective factors, which are not found in all therapies currently being used to treat stress-related disorders. The administration of exogenous agmatine should also be considered a therapeutic element that is capable of triggering a neural protective response that counters the effects of chronic stress. When combined with existing treatment strategies, this may have synergistic beneficial effects.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) accounts for up to 60% of equine lameness. Agmatine, a decarboxylated arginine, may be a viable option for OA management, based on reports of its analgesic properties. Six adult thoroughbred horses, with lameness attributable to thoracic limb OA, received either daily oral phenylbutazone (6.6 mg/kg), agmatine sulfate (25 mg/kg) or a control for 30 days, with 21-day washout periods between treatments. Subjective lameness, thoracic limb ground reaction forces (GRF), plasma agmatine and agmatine metabolite levels were evaluated using an established rubric, a force platform, and mass spectrometry, respectively, before, during and after each treatment period. Gastric ulceration and plasma chemistries were evaluated before and after treatments. Braking GRFs were greater after 14 and 29 days of agmatine compared to phenylbutazone administration. After 14 days of phenylbutazone administration, vertical GRFs were greater than for agmatine or the control. Glandular mucosal ulcer scores were lower after agmatine than phenylbutazone administration. Agmatine plasma levels peaked between 30 and 60 min and were largely undetectable by 24 h after oral administration. In contrast, plasma citric acid levels increased throughout agmatine administration, representing a shift in the metabolomic profile. Agmatine may be a viable option to improve thoracic limb GRFs while reducing the risk of glandular gastric ulceration in horses with OA."

      "abstract": "Antipsychotic-induced obesity affects millions of people and is a serious health condition worldwide. Olanzapine is the most widely prescribed antipsychotic agent with high obesogenic potential. However, the exact mechanism by which it causes its metabolic dysregulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of agmatine in olanzapine-induced metabolic derangements in Female Sprague-Dawley rats. Repeated olanzapine administration for 28 days increased body weight while treatment with agmatine from days 15 to 28 prevented the body weight gain induced by olanzapine without any alteration in food intake. Repeated agmatine treatment decreased the elevated feeding efficiency and adiposity index, as well as improved dysregulated lipid metabolism induced by olanzapine. Increased activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and decreased expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) were detected in chronic olanzapine-treated rats. Although agmatine treatment did not alter FAS activity, it increased CPT-1 activity. It is possible that the inhibitory effect of agmatine on weight gain and adiposity might be associated with increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure in olanzapine-treated rats. We suggest that agmatine can be explored for the prevention of obesity complications associated with chronic antipsychotic treatment.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Dyskinesia is characterized by abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). Such movements are considered restrictive problem associated with the chronic use of L-dopa in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment; the thing that renders the definite pathological mechanism unclear. However, there is a correlation between excitotoxicity of glutamatergic NMDA receptors, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the lesioned nigrostriatal pathway; which mediates the firing of basal ganglia neurons involved in dyskinesia. AIMS: The current study investigated the novel neuroprotective effect of agmatine in ameliorating both PD and dyskinesia with a focus on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic potentiality through Nrf2 activation and suppression of HMGB1/RAGE/TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. MAIN METHODS: PD was induced in animals by ten consecutive doses of rotenone (3 mg/kg/day; s.c.). Agmatine (100 mg/kg/day; i.p.) was injected for 16 days after modeling PD either alone or in combination with L-dopa/carbidopa (50/25 mg/kg/day; i.p.). KEY FINDINGS: A statically significant deteriorating effect was showed on the behavioral, neurochemical, histopathological, and immunochemical analysis of PD rats. Moreover, dyskinesia observed in PD rats that received L-dopa. Agmatine improved animals' behavior and abolished dyskinetic AIMs. It inhibited NMDA receptors expression in nigral tissues leading to inhibition of inflammatory and oxidative stress cascades. It increased both nigral TH immunoreactive cells and striatal dopamine contents. Besides, it increased the antioxidant defense mechanism of Nrf2/TAC contents along with a significant decrease of HMGB1/RAGE/TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB protein expression. SIGNIFICANCE: The current investigated data signifies the novel role of agmatine in ameliorating both PD and dyskinesia through mediating NMDA receptors, Nrf2, and HMGB1/RAGE/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways.",

Nutraceutical interventions may play a significant role in patient management. The current study aimed to determine the potential of Aspalathus linearis (rooibos) to prevent gastrointestinal dysregulation resulting from high-dose trace-amine (TA) exposure. Considering the substantial female bias in functional gastrointestinal disorders, and the suggested phytoestrogenicity of rooibos, the study design allowed for a comparison between the effects of an ethanol extract of green rooibos and 17β-estradiol (E2). High levels of ρ-tyramine (TYR) and agmatine (AGM), but not β-phenethylamine (PEA) or tryptamine (TRP), resulted in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) hypersecretion, increased tight-junction protein (TJP; occludin and ZO-1) secretion and (dissimilarly) disrupted the TJP cellular distribution profile. Modulating benefits of rooibos and E2 were TA-specific. Rooibos pre-treatment generally reduced IL-8 secretion across all TA conditions and prevented PGE2 hypersecretion after exposure to both TYR and AGM, but was only able to normalise TJP levels and the distribution profile in AGM-exposed cells. In contrast, E2 pre-treatment prevented only TYR-associated PGE2 hypersecretion and TJP dysregulation. Together, the data suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of rooibos, rather than phytoestrogenicity, affect benefits illustrated for rooibos."

      "abstract": "Agmatine is an arginine metabolite that has neuroprotective capacity. Recently, it has been found to ameliorate atherosclerosis progression in rabbits. However, further molecular mechanisms of its anti-atherosclerotic properties remain unclear. High plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) are an important risk factor for atherosclerosis due to their detrimental effects on vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Here, we used palmitate (PA), a kind of FFA, to induce endothelial dysfunction in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) to determine the possible biological functions of agmatine. We found that PA caused ECs dysfunction in HMEC-1 cells, decreased cell viability, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release which could be reversed by agmatine treatment. Agmatine also improved the nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity in PA-induced HMEC-1 cells. The PA-caused mitochondrial dysfunction of HMEC-1 cells was diminished after agmatine treatment, as proven by the increased intracellular Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) level, decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Further, agmatine could alleviate PA-caused lipid accumulation with increased levels of Triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in HMEC-1 cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that agmatine administration markedly decreased the expression levels of phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase α (p-AMPKα), p-protein kinase B (p-AKT), and p-eNOS in PA-induced HMEC-1 cells. Inhibition of AMPK by compound C reversed the protective effects of agmatine on PA-induced HMEC-1 cells. Taken together, we hypothesize that agmatine mitigated PA-induced HMEC-1 cell dysfunction by alleviating mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction via the AMPK/PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute liver injury can occur at any stage of sepsis and is an important sign of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Studies have shown that agmatine (AGM) can effectively improve liver injury caused by sepsis. However, due to the numerous metabolites and metabolic pathways of AGM in the human body, its mechanism in treating septic liver injury is unclear. METHODS: In this study, a liver injury model of septic Sprague-Dawley rats was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). After AGM treatment, transcriptomics combined with metabolomics was employed to analyze the gene expression levels and metabolite changes. RESULTS: The results showed that AGM decreased the expression levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), procalcitonin (PCT), and inflammatory factors [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)] in the serum of septic rats. It also reduced liver inflammatory cell infiltration and abnormal lipid metabolism, and promoted the survival rate of septic rats. In addition, 17 differentially-expressed genes were identified by transcriptomics, mainly in arginine and proline metabolism, the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, as well as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signal transduction pathways. Metabolomics analysis was carried out to study the potential liver metabolism spectrum changes induced by AGM treatment. The results showed significant changes in 26 metabolites in the rat liver samples, mainly involved in arginine and proline metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis demonstrated that AGM improved septic liver injury by regulating lipid metabolism, and reduced the inflammatory reaction by affecting fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. The integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics provides an effective means to elucidate AGM's therapeutic pathways and biomarkers."

      "abstract": "Agmatine is a polyamine suggested to act as a supposed neurotransmitter in the brain. Evidence has indicated that acute agmatine administration might modulate memory. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of repeated agmatine treatment on passive avoidance memory, hippocampal calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-alpha (CaMKII-α), and Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in naive mice. Adult male NMRI mice were treated with agmatine (10, 20, 30, 40, and 80 mg/kg/ip) or saline for 11 days. Acquisition and retention tests of passive avoidance memory were performed on days 10 and 11, respectively. Following the memory retention test, the hippocampi were assessed for the levels of CaMKII-α and ERK using the western blotting technique. The results revealed the dose-dependent effect of agmatine on the passive avoidance memory. Accordingly, the memory was impaired in lower doses, but was improved in higher ones. Agmatine in none of the doses affected the nociception of the mice in tail-flick test. Furthermore, agmatine increased the phosphorylation of CaMKII-α and ERK in the hippocampus at memory enhancing doses, while ERK phosphorylation decreased following the impairing doses of agmatine. Thus, the dose-dependent effect of agmatine on memory might be related to its modulatory effect on CaMKII-α and ERK signal transduction, eventually regulating the memory process.",

      "abstract": "Drug tolerance is directly correlated with drug abuse and physical dependence. The development of tolerance is manifested as the decline in pharmacological responses of drugs following repeated administration of the constant dose. The present study evaluated the effect of agmatine in ethanol-induced anti-nociception and tolerance in the tail-flick assay in mice. In an acute protocol, ethanol (1 and 2 g/kg, i.p. [intraperitoneally]) and agmatine (20 and 40 μg/mouse, i.c.v. [intracerebroventricularly]) produced significant analgesic effects in mice, as was evident from the increased baseline tail-flick latency when tested 20 minutes after their administration. Agmatine in a per se non-effective dose (5 μg/mouse, i.c.v.), L-arginine (40 μg/mouse, i.c.v.), and arcaine (25 μg/mouse, i.c.v.) significantly potentiated the anti-nociceptive effect of ethanol. Blood ethanol analysis showed no significant differences in blood ethanol concentration between ethanol/saline- and ethanol/agmatine-treated mice, suggesting that the effects of agmatine were not due to any possible effects on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol. In a separate study, mice were injected with ethanol (2 g/kg, i.p., 12%) or saline (1 mL/kg, i.p.) once daily for 9 days. On days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 of the experiment, they were subjected to the tail-flick test. Agmatine (5-20 μg/mouse, i.c.v.), L-arginine (40 μg/mouse, i.c.v.), arcaine (25 μg/mouse, i.c.v.), aCSF (2 μL/mouse, i.c.v.), or saline (1 mL/kg, i.p.) was administered daily prior to the first daily ethanol or saline injections, and reaction latencies were determined in the tail-flick assay. Injections of agmatine, L-arginine, and arcaine prevented the development of tolerance to ethanol-induced analgesia. Given that agmatine and its endogenous modulation can prevent tolerance to the anti-nociceptive effects of ethanol, these data suggest it as a possible new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of alcohol use disorder and associated complications.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In spinal cord injury (SCI), the primary mechanical damage leads to a neuroinflammatory response and the secondary neuronal injury occurs in response to the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition to the suppression of inflammation, autophagy plays a significant role in the survival of neurons during secondary SCI. The present study aimed to examine the anti-inflammatory and autophagic effects of agmatine and rapamycin in SCI and to compare the results with methylprednisolone (MP) used in the clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this animal-based experimental study, thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups as sham-control, injury, injury+MP, injury+rapamycin, injury+agmatine groups. SCI was induced by compressing the T7-8-9 segments of the spinal cord, using an aneurysm clip for one minute, and then rats were treated daily for 7 days. Seven days post-treatment, damaged spinal cord tissues of sacrificed rats were collected for microscopic and biochemical examinations using histopathologic and transmission electron microscope (TEM) scores. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were spectrophotometrically measured. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the damaged area was smaller in the rapamycin group when compared to the MP group. Many autophagic vacuoles and macrophages were observed in the rapamycin group. Degeneration of axon, myelin, and wide edema was observed in SCI by electron microscopic observations. Fragmented myelin lamellae and contracted axons were also noted. While MDA and GPx levels were increased in the injury group, MDA levels were significantly decreased in the agmatine and MP groups, and GPx levels were decreased in the rapamycin group. CONCLUSION: The results of our study confirmed that rapamycin and agmatine can be an effective treatment for secondary injury of SCI."

Many patients are considered nonresponders to typical pharmacological treatments due to insufficient symptoms' reduction or the inability to tolerate the side effects of these medications. Agmatine is an endogenous neuromodulator with emotional- and cognitive-enhancing properties that arises as a promising agent to manage several Central Nervous System disorders. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic treatment with agmatine on behavioral impairments exhibited by adult Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR), an animal model for the study of ADHD. Adult male Wistar and SHR (3-4 months old) received intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment with saline (NaCl 0.9%) or agmatine (30 mg/kg/day) during 20 consecutive days and were evaluated in a battery of behavioral tasks. Agmatine treatment improved olfactory and recognition memory impairments of SHR evaluated in the olfactory discrimination, object recognition, and social recognition memory tasks. In addition, agmatine administration improved the cognitive flexibility in the water maze test. Agmatine did not alter SHR's locomotor activity and hedonic-like behaviors observed in the open-field and splash tests, respectively. No changes were observed in SHR's systolic blood pressure following agmatine treatment. This study provides the first evidence that agmatine improves olfactory and cognitive impairments observed in an animal model of ADHD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis and NAFLD are the leading causes of death worldwide. The hallmark of NAFLD is triglyceride accumulation caused by an imbalance between lipogenesis de novo and fatty acid oxidation. Agmatine, an endogenous metabolite of arginine, exerts a protective effect on mitochondria and can modulate fatty acid metabolism. In the present study, we investigate the influence of agmatine on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and the development of hepatic steatosis in apoE-/- mice fed with a Western high-fat diet, with a particular focus on its effects on the DNL pathway in the liver. We have proved that treatment of agmatine inhibits the progression of atherosclerosis and attenuates hepatic steatosis in apoE-/- mice on a Western diet. Such effects are associated with decreased total macrophage content in atherosclerotic plaque as well as a decrease in the TG levels and the TG/HDL ratio in plasma. Agmatine also reduced TG accumulation in the liver and decreased the expression of hepatic genes and proteins involved in lipogenesis de novo such as SREBP-1c, FASN and SCD1. In conclusion, agmatine may present therapeutic potential for the treatment of atherosclerosis and fatty liver disease. However, an exact understanding of the mechanisms of the advantageous actions of agmatine requires further study.",

      "abstract": "Background: Epilepsy is a common neurological disease, and neuroinflammation is one of the main contributors to epileptogenesis. Pyroptosis is a type of pro-inflammatory cell death that is related to epilepsy. Agmatine, has anti-inflammatory properties and exerts neuroprotective effects against seizures. Our study investigated the effect of agmatine on the core pyroptosis protein GSDMD in the context of epilepsy. Methods: A chronic epilepsy model and BV2 microglial cellular inflammation model were established by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. H&E and Nissl staining were used to evaluate hippocampal neuronal damage. The expression of pyroptosis and inflammasome factors was examined by western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Agmatine disrupted the kindling acquisition process, which decreased seizure scores and the incidence of full kindling and blocked hippocampal neuronal damage. In addition, agmatine increased BV2 microglial cell survival in vitro and alleviated seizures in vivo by suppressing the levels of PTZ-induced pyroptosis. Finally, the expression of TLR4, MYD88, phospho-IκBα, phospho-NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly upregulated in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells, while agmatine suppressed the expression of these proteins. Conclusions: Our results indicate that agmatine affects epileptogenesis and exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting neuroinflammation, GSDMD activation, and pyroptosis. The inhibitory effect of agmatine on pyroptosis was mediated by the suppression of the TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Therefore, agmatine may be a potential treatment option for epilepsy."

      "abstract": "Agmatine, an endogenous derivative of arginine, has been found to be effective in treating idiopathic pain, convulsion, stress-mediated behavior, and attenuate the withdrawal symptoms of drugs like morphine. In the early stages of ischemic brain injury in animals, exogenous agmatine treatment was found to be neuroprotective. Agmatine is also considered as a putative neurotransmitter and is still an experimental drug. Chemically, agmatine is called agmatine 1-(4-aminobutyl guanidine). Crystallographic study data show that positively-charged guanidine can bind to the protein containing Gly and Asp residues, and the amino group can interact with the complimentary sites of Glu and Ser. In this study, we blocked the amino end of the agmatine by conjugating it with FITC, but the guanidine end was unchanged. We compared the neuroprotective function of the agmatine and agmatine-FITC by treating them in neurons after excitotoxic stimulation. We found that even the amino end blocked neuronal viability in the excitotoxic condition, by NMDA treatment for 1 h, was increased by agmatine-FITC, which was similar to that of agmatine. We also found that the agmatine-FITC treatment reduced the expression of nitric oxide production in NMDA-treated cells. This study suggests that even if the amino end of agmatine is blocked, it can perform its neuroprotective function.",

      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most prevalent movement disorders and the most common cause of abnormal tremors. However, it cannot be treated efficiently with the currently available pharmacotherapy options. The pathophysiology of harmaline-induced tremor, most commonly used model of ET, involves various neurotransmitter systems including glutamate as well as ion channels. Agmatine, an endogenous neuromodulator, interacts with various glutamate receptor subtypes and ion channels, which have been associated with its' beneficial effects on several neurological disorders. The current study aims to assess the effect of agmatine on the harmaline model of ET. Two separate groups of male rats were injected either with saline or agmatine (40 mg/kg) 30 min prior to single intraperitoneal injection of harmaline (20 mg/kg). The percent duration, intensity and frequency of tremor and locomotor activity were evaluated by a custom-built tremor and locomotion analysis system. Pretreatment with agmatine reduced the percent tremor duration and intensity of tremor induced by harmaline, without affecting the tremor frequency. However, it did not affect the decreased spontaneous locomotor activity due to harmaline. This pattern of ameliorating effects of agmatine on harmaline-induced tremor provide the first evidence for being considered as a treatment option for ET.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common diabetic neurovascular complication, and the leading cause of preventable blindness among working-age individuals. Recently, agmatine, the endogenous decarboxylated L-arginine, has gained attention as a pleiotropic agent that modulates the diabetes-associated decline in quality of life, and exhibited varied protective biological effects. Diabetes was induced by a single streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) injection. When diabetes was verified, the animals were randomly allocated into three groups (16 rat each); diabetic, agmatine-treated diabetic (1 mg/kg, daily, for 12 weeks), and control group. Blood glucose homeostasis, retinal redox status, apoptotic parameters, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glutamate, glutamine, glutamine synthase (GS) activity, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) pathways were assayed biochemically. Retinal vascular permeability was measured. Retinal morphology was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Retinal N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor1 (NMDAR1) and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) mRNA were quantified. Glucose transporter 1, pro-caspase3, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Chronic agmatine treatment abrogated STZ-induced retinal neurodegeneration features including gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis, restored retinal vascular permeability, mostly through antioxidant, anti-apoptotic capacity, abolishing glutamate excitotoxicity, modulating the activity of NMDARs, MAPKs/NFκB, and NOS/NO pathways. By restoring the molecular and functional background of retinal neurovascular homeostatic balance, agmatine would be appropriate therapeutic option acting upstream of the DR, impeding its progression.",

Statins exhibits a wide range of neurobehavioral effects in addition to their peripheral actions, and may be beneficial in treatment of psychiatric conditions. Present study investigated the role of agmatine and imidazoline receptors in antidepressant-like effect of statins in mouse forced swimming test (FST). The antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin (5 mg/kg, p.o.) and simvastatin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) was potentiated by pretreatment with agmatine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) as well as the drugs known to increase endogenous agmatine levels in brain viz., L-arginine (40 μg/mouse, i.c.v.), an agmatine biosynthetic precursor; arcaine (50 μg/mouse, i.c.v), agmatinase inhibitor; and aminoguanidine (6.5 μg/mouse, i.c.v.), a diamine oxidase inhibitor. Further, both the statins increased agmatine levels within hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Conversely, prior administration of I1 receptor antagonist, efaroxan (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and I2 receptor antagonist, idazoxan (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked the antidepressant-like effect of statins and their synergistic combination with agmatine. These results demonstrate the involvement of agmatine and imidazoline receptors in antidepressant-like effect of statins and suggest as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders.",

The present study sought to assess alterations in agmatine metabolism in the beta-amyloid (Aβ1-42) Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Aβ1-42 injected mice showed impairment of cognitive functioning as evidenced by increased working and reference memory errors in radial arm maze (RAM). This cognitive impairment was associated with a reduction in the agmatine levels and elevation in its degrading enzyme, agmatinase, whereas reduced immunocontent was observed in its synthesizing enzyme arginine decarboxylase expression within hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Chronic agmatine treatment and its endogenous modulation by l-arginine, or arcaine or aminoguanidine prevented the learning and memory impairment induced by single intracranial Aβ1-42 peptide injection. In conclusion, the present study suggests the importance of the endogenous agmatinergic system in β-amyloid induced memory impairment in mice.",

Following 7 days of LPS administration, animals were subjected to NOR test on Day-8 and MWM test on Days-9 to 13 for the assessment of recognition and spatial learning and memory, respectively. RESULTS: LPS administration produced significant deficits in recognition and spatial memory in mice after seven days of LPS administration. In LPS pre-treated mice, agmatine treatment on Day-8 resulted in the increased exploration to the novel object. Agmatine treatment (Day 8-12) in mice showed reduction in the escape latency and time spent in the target quadrant (probe trial) in the MWM test. However, co-administration of agmatine with LPS in mice for 7 days showed higher discrimination index in NOR test on Day-8. This co-administration also decreased escape latency and time spent in the target quadrant in MWM test on Days 9-13 as compared to LPS control group. CONCLUSION: Results implies the protective and curative effects of agmatine against LPS-induced loss of memory functions in experimental animals.HighlightsSubchronic but not acute lipopolysaccharides induce memory deficitsLipopolysaccharides impairs recognition and spatial memory in mice.Agmatine prevents lipopolysaccharides-induced loss of memory.Agmatine reverses deficits in learning and memory by lipopolysaccharides.",

The ADHD group included 35 treatment-naive children (6-14 years old) who were ewly diagnosed with ADHD. The control group consisted of 35 healthy children with the same age and sex, having no previous psychiatric disorders. In the study groups, Stroop test (ST) and trail making test (TMT) were used to monitor EF, and blood samples were collected to measure agmatine with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and NO, glutamate, and arginine with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The EFs were significantly impaired in the ADHD group. The agmatine and arginine levels of the ADHD group were significantly higher than their peers. The NO and glutamate levels were also higher in the ADHD group compared to the control group, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Children with ADHD had more difficulties during EF tasks compared to healthy children. The elevated NO and glutamate levels may be related with the impairment during EF tasks. Therefore, agmatine and arginine may increase to improve EF tasks through its inhibitory effect on the synthesis of NO and glutamate. Further studies are needed about polyamine pathway molecules to shed light on the pathophysiology of ADHD.",

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common clinical problem for which there is no effective medical treatment. However, agmatine has been shown to be effective against ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury in rats, a similar condition to CIN. Our aim was to examine the protective effects of agmatine in a rat model of CIN and, based on those results, in a rabbit model of CIN. CIN in the rat model was induced by intravenous administration of indomethacin (10 mg/kg), Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (10 mg/kg) and iopamidol (OYPALOMIN, 7.4 g iodine/kg) at 2 weeks after a unilateral nephrectomy. CIN in the rabbit model was induced by intrarenal arterial injection of only iopamidol (BYSTAGE, 4.8 g iodine/kg). Intravenous injection of agmatine (0.1 and 0.3 mmol/kg) did not attenuate the CIN-induced renal insufficiency in the rat model. Intravenous injection of agmatine (0.3 mmol/kg) attenuated the CIN-induced renal insufficiency in the rabbit model such as increases in blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine levels. Renal histological damage was also improved by the agmatine administration. The difference in effects of agmatine injection between CIN rats and CIN rabbits was caused by indomethacin and L-NAME administrations. These results indicate that agmatine prevents the development of CIN-induced renal insufficiency in rabbits, and the effect is accompanied by activation of nitric oxide synthase and subsequent increase of blood flow.",

Agmatine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, p.o.) and ketamine (1 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) produced an antidepressant-like effect in the tail suspension test. The combination of agmatine (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.) and ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), at subthreshold doses, produced an antidepressant-like effect 1 h, 24 h and 7d after treatment. Western blot analysis from prefrontal cortex tissue showed that the combined treatment, after 1 h, increased p70S6K and GluA1, and reduced synapsin 1 phosphorylation. Additionally, after 24 h, Akt, p70S6K, GluA1, and synapsin 1 phosphorylation; and PSD95 immunocontent increased (which persisted for up to 7d). Dendritic architecture analysis of the prefrontal cortex revealed that the combined treatment improved dendritic arbor complexity (after 24 h, up to 7d), and increased spine density (after 1 h, up to 24 h). Morphometric analysis revealed a filopodia-shaped dendrite spine upregulation after 1 h. A predominance of stubby, mushroom, branched and filopodia; and a reduction in thin protrusions were observed after 24 h. Finally, mushroom-shaped dendritic spines predominance increased after 7d. Agmatine potentiated ketamine's antidepressant, and dendritic arbors and spines remodeling effects in a time-dependent manner. Our data indicate Akt/p70S6K signaling as a likely target for these effects.",

Present study was designed to examine the relationship between agmatine and the imidazoline receptors in memory deficits induced by Aβ1-42 peptide in mice. Mice were treated with single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Aβ1-42 peptide (3 μg) and evaluated for learning and memory in Morris water maze (MWM) and subjected to Aβ1-42, TNF-α and IL-6 and BDNF immunocontent analysis within the hippocampus. While the learning and memory impairment was evident in the mice subjected to MWM test following Aβ1-42 peptide administration, there was a significant increase in Aβ1-42, TNF-α and IL-6 and reduction in BDNF immunocontent within the hippocampus. Daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment with agmatine (10 and 20 mg/kg); imidazoline I1 receptor agonist, moxonidine and imidazoline I2 receptor agonist, 2-BFI starting from day 8 to 27 post-Aβ1-42 injection, significantly prevented the cognitive deficits and normalized the Aβ1-42 peptide, IL-6, TNF-α and BDNF immunocontent in hippocampus. On the other hand, pre-treatment with imidazoline I1 receptor antagonist, efaroxan and imidazoline I2 receptor antagonist, BU 224 attenuated the effects of agmatine on learning and memory in MWM, IL-6, TNF-α and BDNF content. In conclusion, the present study provides functional evidence for the involvement of the imidazoline receptors in agmatine induced reversal of Aβ1-42 induced memory deficits in mice. The data projects agmatine and imidazoline receptor agonists as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.",

The administration of muscimol (0.1 mg/kg, i.p., GABAA receptor agonist) or diazepam (0.05 mg/kg, p.o., GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator) at doses that caused no effect in the tail suspension test (TST) combined with a subeffective dose of agmatine (0.0001 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the TST. In another set of experiments, the administration of baclofen (1 mg/kg, i.p., GABAB receptor agonist) abolished the reduction of immobility time in the TST elicited by agmatine (0.1 mg/kg, p.o., active dose). In another cohort of animals, treatment with NMDA (0.1 pmol/site, i.c.v.) prevented the antidepressant-like effect of the combined administration of agmatine and muscimol as well as ketamine and muscimol in the TST. Results suggest that the effect of agmatine in the TST may involve an activation of GABAA receptors dependent on NMDA receptor inhibition, similar to ketamine, as well as modulation of GABAB receptors.",

      "abstract": "Chronic treatment with agmatine, similarly to fluoxetine, may cause antidepressant-like effects mediated, at least in part, by the modulation of hippocampal plasticity. However, the ability of chronic treatment with agmatine to cause antidepressant-like effects associated with the modulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and protection against neuronal death remains to be established. In this study, we investigated the effects of agmatine (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) and the conventional antidepressant fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment on the levels of phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), neuronal death, and overall volume in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of mice exposed to chronic corticosterone (20 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days, a model of stress and depressive-like behavior. Chronic corticosterone treatment increased cell death in the sub-granular zone (SGZ) of the DG, as assessed by Fluoro-Jade B labeling. Agmatine, similarly to fluoxetine, was capable of reversing this alteration in the entire DG, an effect more evident in the ventral portion of the hippocampus. Additionally, reduced phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448), a pro-survival protein that is active when phosphorylated at Ser2448, was observed in the whole hippocampal DG in corticosterone-treated mice, an effect not observed in agmatine or fluoxetine-treated mice. Chronic exposure to corticosterone caused a significant reduction in overall hippocampal volume, although no alterations were observed between the groups with regards to DG volume. Altogether, the results indicate that agmatine, similar to fluoxetine, was able to counteract corticosterone-induced impairment on mTOR signaling and cell death in hippocampal DG.",

      "abstract": "Bioreducible cationic polymers have gained considerable attention in gene delivery due to their low cytotoxicity and high efficiency. In the present work, we reported a cationic polymer, poly(disulfide-l-lysine)-g-agmatine (denoted as SSL-AG), and evaluated its ability to transfer pEGFP-ZNF580 plasmid (pZNF580) into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This SSL-AG polymeric carrier efficiently condensed pZNF580 into positively charged particles (<200 nm) through electrostatic interaction. This carrier also exhibited excellent buffering capacity in the physiological environment, good pDNA protection against enzymatic degradation and rapid pDNA release in a highly reducing environment mainly because of the responsive cleavage of disulfide bonds in the polymer backbone. The hemolysis assay and in vitro cytotoxicity assay suggested that the SSL-AG carrier and corresponding gene complexes possessed both good hemocompatibility and great cell viability in HUVECs. The cellular uptake of the SSL-AG/Cy5-oligonucleotide group was 3.6 times that of the poly(l-lysine)/Cy5-oligonucleotide group, and its mean fluorescence intensity value was even higher than that of the PEI 25 kDa/Cy5-oligonucleotide group. Further, the intracellular trafficking results demonstrated that the SSL-AG/Cy5-oligonucleotide complexes exhibited a high nucleus co-localization rate (CLR) value (36.0 ± 2.8%, 3.4 times that of the poly (l-lysine)/Cy5-oligonucleotide group, 1.6 times that of the poly(disulfide-l-lysine)-g-butylenediamine/Cy5-oligonucleotide group) at 24 h, while the endo/lysosomal CLR value was relatively low. This suggested that SSL-AG successfully delivered plasmid into HUVECs with high cellular uptake, rapid endosomal escape and efficient nuclear accumulation owing to the structural advantages of the bioreducible and agmatine groups. In vitro transfection assay also verified the enhanced transfection efficiency in the SSL-AG/pZNF580 group. Furthermore, the results of CCK-8, cell migration and in vitro/vivo angiogenesis assays revealed that pZNF580 delivered by SSL-AG could effectively enhance the proliferation, migration and vascularization of HUVECs. In a word, the SSL-AG polymer has great potential as a safe and efficient gene carrier for gene therapy.",

Previous clinical studies strongly support the use of dietary agmatine as a safe and effective treatment for neuropathic pain. Based on this evidence, we conducted an open-label consecutive case series study to evaluate the effectiveness of agmatine in neuropathies associated with painful SFN (Study Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov, System Identifier: NCT01524666). Participants diagnosed with painful SFN and autonomic dysfunctions were treated with 2.67 g/day agmatine sulfate (AgmaSet® capsules containing G-Agmatine® brand of agmatine sulfate) for a period of 2 months. Before the beginning (baseline) and at the end of the treatment period, participants answered the established 12-item neuropathic pain questionnaire specifically developed to distinguish symptoms associated with neuropathy and to quantify their severity. Secondary outcomes included other treatment options and a safety assessment. Twelve patients were recruited, and 11 patients-8 diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy, two with idiopathic neuropathy and one with inflammatory neuropathy-completed the study. All patients showed improvement in neuropathic pain to a varied extent. The average decrease in pain intensity was 26.0 rating points, corresponding to a 46.4% reduction in overall pain (p < 0.00001). The results suggest that dietary agmatine sulfate has a significant effect in reducing neuropathic pain intensity associated with painful SFN resistant to treatment with conventional neuropathic pain medications. Larger randomized placebo-controlled studies are expected to establish agmatine sulfate as a preferred treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The knowledge that agmatine is found in the human body has existed for several years; however, its role in sepsis has not yet been studied. In the present study, we investigate the role of agmatine in the progression and treatment of sepsis. DESIGN: Clinical/laboratory investigations. SETTING: Medical centers/University-based research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Elective ICU patients with severe sepsis and healthy volunteers; C57BL/6 mice weighing 18-22 g. INTERVENTIONS: Serum agmatine level and its associations with inflammatory markers were assessed in patients with sepsis. Agmatine was administered intraperitoneally to mice before a lipopolysaccharide challenge. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages were pretreated with agmatine followed by lipopolysaccharide stimulation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum agmatine levels were significantly decreased in patients with sepsis and lipopolysaccharide-induced mice, and correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, procalcitonin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 levels. In a therapeutic experiment, exogenous agmatine attenuated the cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with sepsis and healthy controls. Agmatine also exerted a significant beneficial effect in the inflammatory response and organ damage and reduced the death rate in lipopolysaccharide-induced mice. Imidazoline I2 receptor agonist 2-benzofuran-2-yl blocked the pharmacological action of agmatine; whereas, other imidazoline receptor ligands did not. Furthermore, agmatine significantly impaired the inflammatory response by inactivating nuclear factor-κB, but not protein 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase signaling in macrophages. Activation of imidazoline I2 receptor or knockdown of ribosomal S6 kinase 2 counteracted the effects of agmatine on phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-κBα. CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous agmatine metabolism correlated with the progression of sepsis. Supplemental exogenous agmatine could ameliorate the lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammatory responses and multiple organ injuries through the imidazoline I2 receptor-ribosomal S6 kinase 2-nuclear factor-κB pathway. Agmatine could be used as both a clinical biomarker and a promising pharmaconutrient in patients with severe sepsis.",

Various studies described the physiological role of endogenous agmatine in learning and memory of multiple cognitive tasks suggesting elevated levels of agmatine during the learning process in the rat brain. Dietary intake of choline showed correlation with cognitive functions in human subjects and treatment with choline supplements validated the ability to diminish learning and cognitive impairment dementias. METHODS: 36 Albino rats were equally divided into three groups previously: a) control-water, b) Test I - AlCl3 (100 mg/Kg body weight), and c) Test II - Forced swim stress (FSS) for 14 days. On the next day of AlCl3 and FSS last administration, animals were allocated into further three groups and received the following treatments: a. water was given orally to the control group, b. Agmatine (100 mg/Kg Body Weight) group, and c. Choline (100 mg/Kg Body Weight) group for the next 14 days. Behaviors were assessed in Light/Dark Box, Open Field, Novel Object Recognition Test (NOR), T Maze Test, and Morris Water Maze Test. RESULTS: Animals administered with agmatine demonstrated increased time spent in bright areas of light/dark box and square crossed while improved spatial memory in Morris water maze and T maze test and enhanced discrimination of novel object in NOR were observed in learning and memory paradigms along with choline. CONCLUSION: The present study determines that agmatine at the dose of (100 mg/kg body weight) attenuates memory and cognitive impairment in comparison with choline supplements.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol is one of the most widely abused recreational drugs, largely linked with serious health and social concerns. However, the treatment options for alcohol-use disorders have limited efficacy and exhibit a range of adverse drug reactions. Large numbers of preclinical studies have projected a biogenic amine, agmatine as a promising potential treatment option for drug addiction, including alcoholism. In the present study, administration of agmatine (20-40 mg/kg, i.p.) resulted in significant inhibition of ethanol self-administration in the right p-VTA in operant conditioning paradigm. Further, acute intracranial administration of agmatine (20 and 40 μg/rat) significantly reduced the ethanol consumption in the two bottle choice paradigm. Agmatine is degraded to putrescine and guanido-butanoic acid by the enzyme agmatinase and diamine oxidase respectively and inhibition of these enzymes results in augmentation of endogenous agmatine. In the present study, diamine oxidase inhibitor, aminoguanidine and agmatinase inhibitor, arcaine were used to block the agmatine metabolic pathways to increase brain agmatine levels. Drugs that augment endogenous agmatine levels like L-arginine (80 μg/rat, i.c.v.) or arcaine (50 μg/rat, i.c.v.) and aminoguanidine (25 μg/rat, i.c.v.) also reduced the ethanol consumption following their central administration. The pharmacological effect of agmatine on ethanol consumption was potentiated by imidazoline receptor agonists, I1 agonist moxonidine (25 μg/rat, i.c.v.), and imidazoline I2 agonist, 2-BFI (10 μg/rat, i.c.v.) and was blocked by imidazoline I1 antagonist, efaroxan (10 μg/rat, i.c.v.), and I2 antagonist, idazoxan (4 μg/rat, i.c.v.) at their ineffective doses per se. Thus, our result suggests the involvement of imidazoline I1 and I2 receptors in agmatine induced inhibition of ethanol consumption in rats.",

In preclinical studies, injection has been the predominant route of systemic administration. However, a significant translational step would be the use of oral agmatine treatment at therapeutic doses and better understanding of L-arginine metabolic profiles in the CNS post-treatment. The present study systematically investigated the tolerability, safety and brain-plasma neurochemistry following daily oral agmatine sulfate treatment (via gavage) to wild-type (WT) mice up to 900 mg/kg for one week (Experiment 1) or WT and APPswe/PS1ΔE9 transgenic (Tg) mice at 300 mg/kg for fifteen weeks (Experiment 2). Agmatine treatment in both experiments was well tolerated with no marked behavioural impairments, and gross necropsy and organ histology revealed no pathological alterations after 15-week dosing. Moreover, oral treatment increased agmatine levels in the hippocampus and plasma of WT mice (Experiment 1), and in 6 brain regions examined (but not plasma) of WT and Tg mice (Experiment 2), at 30 minutes or 24 hours post-treatment respectively. This study provides fundamental pre-clinical evidence that daily oral delivery of agmatine sulfate to both WT and Tg mice is safe and well tolerated. Exogenous agmatine passes through the blood brain barrier and accumulates in the brain to a greater extent in Tg mice. Furthermore exogenous agmatine has differential actions in the brain and periphery, and its effect on brain putrescine appears to be dependent on the time post-treatment.",

      "abstract": "Changes in cellular metabolism, development of oxidative-nitrative stress and intensification of glycation and lipid peroxidation (LPO), are significant processes that occur during diabetes mellitus (DM)-associated chronic hyperglycemia. These processes contribute to deviations in the structural organization and functional activity of leukocytes. The development of oxidative-nitrative stress in peripheral blood cells during DM can be prevented by agmatine, an endogenous metabolite of L-arginine, which is a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, and possesses hypoglycemic properties. The administration of agmatine to animals with DM lead to the inhibition of both constitutive and inducible NOS in leukocytes, which in turn decreased total nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels. Additionally, we observed corresponding increases in reduced glutathione content and activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GR), along with decreased levels of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) and advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) as compared to the non-treated diabetic group. Our results indicate that treatment of diabetic animals with agmatine restores redox homeostasis and a balances antioxidant defence system enzymes in leukocytes. This corrective effect on the functional capacity of leukocytes is exerted by preventing oxidative-nitrative stress in animals with DM."

      "abstract": "Agmatine, a metabolite generated by arginine decarboxylation, has been reported as neuromodulator and neuroactive substance. Several findings suggest that agmatine displays neuroprotective effects in several models of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been hypothesized that biogenic amines may be involved in neuroprotection by scavenging oxygen radicals, thus preventing the generation of oxidative stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction, that leads to a reduction of oxygen consumption, followed by activation of prolyl hydroxylase and decrease of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) levels, has been demonstrated to play a role in PD pathogenesis. Using rotenone-treated differentiated SH-SY5Y cells as the in vitro PD model, we here investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying agmatine neuroprotective effects. Our results showed that the preliminary addition of agmatine induces HIF-1α activation, and prevents the rotenone-induced production of free radical species, and the activation of apoptotic pathways by inhibiting mitochondrial membrane potential decrease and caspase 3 as well as cytochrome c increase. Notably, these effects are mediated by HIF-1α, as indicated by experiments using a HIF-1α inhibitor. The present findings suggest that the treatment with agmatine is able to counteract the neuronal cell injury evoked by mitochondrial toxins.",

Agmatine (AGM), a biogenic amine metabolite of l-arginine, induces a variety of physiological and pharmacological effects in the body. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of AGM on hyperoxia-induced lung injury and explored the underlying mechanism. A series of methods were used including flow cytometry, tunnel assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The results indicate that AGM can protect hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Further studies suggest that AGM decreased the upregulated expression of lncRNA gadd7 caused by hyperoxia and due to the presence of the competitive binding of lncRNA gadd7 and MFN1 to miR-125a, AGM indirectly decreased MFN1 protein expression to inhibit the cells apoptosis. In conclusion, AGM protects hyperoxia-induced lung injury by decreasing the expression of lncRNA gadd7 to regulate MFN1 expression.",

However, there were few studies on the effect of agmatine on feeding behavior in fishes. Here, we investigated the impact of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of agmatine (1.25-20 nmol/fish) on food intake in mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi). At 1-h post-injection, food intake showed a significant decrease in agmatine-treated fishes compared with the saline treated. Furthermore, the food intake in agmatine treatment mostly did not differ from that in saline treatment at 4--24-h post-injection as well as the results of genes expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-regulated peptide (AgRP), and anorexigenic melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R). In accordance with the insulin level increasing in liver, the gene expression of insulin receptor substrate (IRS2) was significantly higher in agmatine treatment compared to saline treatment at 1-h post-injection. Thus, the anorexigenic effect of agmatine is likely to decrease NPY and AgRP expression levels and increase MC4R and IRS2 levels which was coupled with stimulation of insulin secretion. Although these initial findings are limited in dose, the data firstly provides evidence for the anorectic effects of agmatine in fish.",

Increasing evidence suggests that accelerated polyamine metabolism is associated with the pathophysiology of depression.

Agmatine is a promising target of altered polyamine metabolism considering its unique ability to regulate intracellular polyamine content and neuroprotective effects. Areas covered: This review discusses the polyamine system and its relationship to the central and enteric nervous system, focusing on results from preclinical studies supporting the relationship between agmatine and the pathophysiology of depression. We also discussed the main mechanisms underlying the antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of agmatine. Expert opinion: Our review points out the possible relationship between polyamines and the pathophysiology of depression. It discusses the efficacy of agmatine in several models of depressive-like behaviour, and suggests that it may prove to be an efficacious adjunctive treatment in bipolar depression. Furthermore, it discusses a proposed pathway linking systemic inflammation, observed in a subset of bipolar disorder patients, to abnormal polyamine metabolism and associated changes in the epithelial gut barrier and blood-brain barrier.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Locomotor sensitization to repeated ethanol (EtOH) administration is proposed to play a role in early and recurring steps of addiction. The present study was designed to examine the effect of agmatine on EtOH-induced locomotor sensitization in mice. METHODS: Mice received daily single intraperitoneal injection of EtOH (2.5 g/kg, 20 v/v) for 7 consecutive days. Following a 3-day EtOH-free phase, the mice were challenged with EtOH on day 11 with a single injection of EtOH. Agmatine (10 to 40 μg/mouse), endogenous agmatine enhancers (l-arginine [80 μg/mouse], arcaine [50 μg/mouse], aminoguanidine [25 μg/mouse]), and imidazoline receptor agonist/antagonists were injected (intracerebroventricular [i.c.v.]) either daily before the injection of EtOH during the 7-day development phase or on days 8, 9, and 10 (EtOH-free phase). The horizontal locomotor activity was determined on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 11. RESULTS: Agmatine (20 to 40 μg/mouse) administration for 7 days (development phase) significantly attenuated the locomotor sensitization response of EtOH challenge on day 11. Further, the agmatine administered only during EtOH-free period (days 8, 9, and 10) also inhibited the enhanced locomotor activity on the 11th day to EtOH challenge as compared to control mice indicating blockade of expression of sensitization. Daily treatment (i.c.v.) with endogenous agmatine enhancers like l-arginine (80 μg/mouse) or arcaine (50 μg/mouse) and aminoguanidine (25 μg/mouse) restrained the development as well as expression of sensitization to EtOH. Imidazoline I1 receptor agonist, moxonidine, and I2 agonist, 2-BFI, not only decreased the development and expression of locomotor sensitization but also potentiated the effect of agmatine when employed in combination. Importantly, I1 receptor antagonist, efaroxan, and I2 antagonist, idazoxan, blocked the effect of agmatine, revealing the involvement of imidazoline receptors in agmatine-mediated inhibition of EtOH sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of EtOH sensitization by agmatine is mediated through imidazoline receptors and project agmatine and imidazoline agents in the pharmacotherapy of alcohol addiction.",

      "abstract": "Background: Pain from coxofemoral joint (CFJ) osteoarthritis (OA) characteristic of canine hip dysplasia (CHD) afflicts many dogs. Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is a common CFJ OA comorbidity. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration is standard for treatment of pain from degenerative joint disease. Potential side effects and tolerance from prolonged administration drive efforts to identify compounds that may be alternatives to or combined with NSAIDs. Agmatine, decarboxylated arginine, reportedly alleviates neuropathic pain, a likely component of OA pain. The objective of this study was to compare treatment response to agmatine and carprofen in dogs with varying degrees of CFJ OA with or without IVD degeneration and to test the hypothesis that agmatine improves hindlimb use comparably to carprofen and more than placebo. Methods: Nine hound-type dogs received oral carprofen (4.4 mg/kg, sid) for 7 days. Six months later, oral agmatine sulfate (25 mg/kg, bid) or placebo (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, bid) was administered to the same dogs for 28 days with a 2 week washout period between treatments. Validated pain assessment scores were measured before treatment and every seven days throughout the treatment periods. Serum chemistry levels and ground reaction forces (GRF) were quantified before and after each treatment period. A board-certified radiologist quantified radiographic CFJ OA based on Orthopedic Foundation for Animals criteria and IVD degeneration on magnetic resonance images. GRFs were compared among treatments at each time point and among time points for each treatment. Results: There were no detectable adverse effects with any treatment. Significant results included improved GRFs in dogs with mild CFJ OA (N = 3) following agmatine administration compared to carprofen or placebo and a trend for improved GRFs in dogs with moderate CFJ OA (N = 2) following carprofen vs. agmatine or placebo. Neither agmatine nor carprofen improved GRFs in dogs with severe CFJ OA (N = 4). The GRFs improved in dogs with IVD degeneration (N = 3) following carprofen treatment compared to agmatine or placebo regardless of CFJ OA score, but no effect was observed in dogs with normal lumbar spines (N = 6). Conclusions: Results support agmatine over carprofen treatment to improve limb use in dogs with early or mild CFJ OA, while carprofen may be the better choice for dogs with moderate CFJ OA or IVD degeneration regardless of CFJ OA severity."

The current study was designed to test if agmatine as nitric oxide modulator has protective effects against valproate-induced hepatic injury. Male Swiss albino mice were treated with sodium valproate (SVP) with or without agmatine for 7 days. Serum and liver samples were collected for analysis. Results have revealed that agmatine exerted hepatoprotective effects against SVP-associated hepatic injury. Agmatine ameliorated SVP-induced elevated serum biochemical markers of hepatic damage such as serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Histopathological examination of the liver showed improvement of hepatic lesions in case of agmatine treatment. Furthermore, agmatine attenuated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidants in liver tissue. Agmatine inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-κB and ameliorated the immunoexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthetase. This was accompanied by decrease in the level of inflammatory markers as nitrite/nitrate, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6. These data provide new evidence of the hepatoprotective activity of agmatine against SVP-induced hepatotoxic effects.",

Both habenular nuclei, the lateral as well as the medial nucleus, are considered to play a prominent role in mental disorders like major depression. Herein, we investigate the effect of the polyamine agmatine on the electrical activity of neurons within the medial habenula in rat. We present evidence that agmatine strongly decreases spontaneous action potential firing of medial habenular neurons by activating I1-type imidazoline receptors. Additionally, we compare the expression patterns of agmatinase, an enzyme capable of inactivating agmatine, in rat and human habenula. In the medial habenula of both species, agmatinase is similarly distributed and observed in neurons and, in particular, in distinct neuropil areas. The putative relevance of these findings in the context of depression is discussed. It is concluded that increased activity of the agmatinergic system in the medial habenula may strengthen midbrain dopaminergic activity. Consequently, the habenular-interpeduncular axis may be dysregulated in patients with major depression.",

A previous study reported that agmatine caused a fast-acting effect in mice subjected to chronic mild stress without causing changes in the levels of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex. We examined whether a single administration of agmatine is able to counteract the depressive-like behavior induced by chronic administration of corticosterone, a pharmacological model of stress, paralleled with the modulation of synaptic protein levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Female mice received corticosterone (20 mg/kg, p.o.) for 21 days and, in the last day of treatment, were administered with a single dose of agmatine (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o.; control for a conventional antidepressant) or ketamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.; control for a fast-acting antidepressant). Agmatine, similar to ketamine, reversed the depressive-like behavior induced by corticosterone in the tail suspension test (TST), an effect that was not observed in mice treated with fluoxetine. The immunocontent of GluA1 was increased by all the treatments in the hippocampus of control mice, whereas PSD95 was not significantly altered by treatments in any brain structure. Although the levels of synaptic proteins do not seem to account for the behavioral findings reported here, the present study provides clear evidence for the fast-acting antidepressant profile of agmatine in the TST, similar to ketamine.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta, accompanied by motor and nonmotor symptoms. The neuropathological hallmarks of PD are well reported, but the etiology of the disease is still undefined; several studies assume that oxidative stress, mitochondrial defects, and neuroinflammation play vital roles in the progress of the disease. The current study was established to investigate the neuroprotective effect of agmatine on a rotenone (ROT)-induced experimental model of PD. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subcutaneously injected with ROT at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight for 35 days. Agmatine was injected intraperitoneally at 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight, 1 h prior to ROT administration. ROT-treated rats that received agmatine showed better performance on beam walking and an elevated number of rears within the cylinder test. In addition, agmatine reduced midbrain malondialdehyde as an indication of lipid peroxidation, pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1β, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Moreover, agmatine was responsible for preventing loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. In conclusion, our study showed that agmatine possesses a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. These findings need further clinical investigations of agmatine as a promising neuroprotective agent for the future treatment of PD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exogenous agmatine inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation and dysfunction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by modulating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and MAPK signal pathways and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). METHODS: Cultured HUVECs were treated with agmatine at the optimized concentration of 1.0 mmolγL, LPS (10 µgγmL), and LPS + agmatine, with or without pretreatment with the inhibitors of NF-κB (PDTC), p38 (SB203580), and ERK (PD98059) for 1 h. The levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), soluble E-selectin and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in the supernatant were determined using ELISA, and their mRNA expressions, along with heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), were assessed using real-time PCR. ROS production in the cells was determined using 2, 7-dichlorofluoresce in diacetate (DCFH-DA) as the fluorescence probe. The protein expressions of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, p65, phospho-p65 (p-p65), IκBα, p-IκBα, ERK, p-ERK, p38, p-p38, JNK, and p-JNK were detected using Western blotting. RESULTS: LPS stimulation for 6 and 24 h significantly increased the levels of sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE-selectin and MCP-1 in the supernatant, intracellular ROS production, and the mRNA expressions of these molecules (P<0.05). Intervention with 1 mmolγL agmatine, similar with pretreatment with p38, ERK and NF-κB inhibitors, obviously inhibited such effects of LPS in HUVECs (P<0.05). Agmatine significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of HO-1 (P<0.05), inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK, nuclear p65 and cytoplasmic IκBα, and up-regulated the protein expression of cytoplasmic IκBα. CONCLUSION: Agmatine inhibits LPS-induced activation and dysfunction of HUVECs by modulating NF-κB and MAPK signal pathways to down-regulate the expressions of adhesion molecules and chemokines and by up-regulating the expression of HO-1 to reduce ROS production.",

Clinical studies indicate reduced efficacy of the current antidepressants for the treatment of depression in AD. In this regard, agmatine emerges as a neuroprotective agent that presents diverse effects, including antidepressant and antioxidant properties. Here we investigated the antioxidant and antidepressant-like effects of agmatine in a mouse model of AD induced by a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of amyloid-β 1-40 (Aβ). Mice were treated with agmatine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) once a day during seven consecutive days. The first administration of agmatine was 24 h before the i.c.v. injection of aggregated Aβ 1-40 (400 pmol/mouse). Ten days after Aβ injection, mice were evaluated in the forced swimming test (FST) and open field test for assessment of depressive-like behavior and locomotor activity, respectively. Oxidative parameters were evaluated in the hippocampus of mice 24 h after Aβ injection. Agmatine prevented Aβ-induced increase in hippocampal lipid peroxidation levels and Aβ-induced decrease in catalase activity. In addition, agmatine prevented the increase in immobility time in the FST and the decrease in the latency to the first immobility episode induced by Aβ, without changing locomotion in the open field test. These results demonstrate the antioxidant and antidepressant-like effects of agmatine in a mouse model of AD, indicating the potential of agmatine for the treatment of depression associated to AD.",

Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known side effect of cisplatin and has the potential to result in limiting and/or reducing the dose, decreasing the quality of life. Unfortunately, the mechanism for cisplatin-induced neuropathy has not been completely elucidated. Currently, available treatments for neuropathic pain (NP) are mostly symptomatic, insufficient and are often linked with several detrimental side effects; thus, effective treatments are needed. Cannabinoids and agmatine are endogenous modulators that are implicated in painful states. This review explains the cisplatin-induced neuropathy and antinociceptive effects of cannabinoids and agmatine in animal models of NP and their putative therapeutic potential in cisplatin-induced neuropathy."

      "abstract": "Methamphetamine (METH) abuse is one the most worldwide problems with wide-ranging effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Chronic METH abuse can associate with cognitive abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. Agmatine, a cationic polyamine, has been proposed as a neuromodulator that modulates many effects of abused drugs. The aim of this study was to determine if agmatine can decrease the impairment effect of METH on memory and hippocampal CaMKII-α gene expression, a gene that plays a major role in memory. Male wistar rats (200-220 g) were allocated into 7 groups, including 5 groups of saline, METH (1, 2 mg/kg), Agmatine (5, 10 mg/kg) and 2 groups of agmatine (5, 10 mg/kg) with higher doses of METH (2 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days (n = 8 in each group). All injections were done intraperitoneally and agmatine was administrated 10 min before METH treatment. Furthermore, Passive avoidance learning (PAL) test was assessed on the 5th day. Retention test was done 24 h after training and the rats were sacrificed immediately. Hippocampi were removed and stored at -80 °C. Finally, hippocampal CaMKII-α gene expression was measured using Quantitative Real-time PCR. Our data showed that chronic METH dose-dependently impaired PAL retrieval, as it decreased step-through latency (STL) and increased time spent in the dark compartment (TDC). While Agmatine with a higher dose (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased impairment effect of METH (2 mg/kg) on PAL and memory. Also, molecular results revealed that METH (2 mg/kg) markedly decreased hippocampal CaMKII-α gene expression while agmatine (10 mg/kg) co-adminstration prevented it. Taken together, the results propose that agmatine may provide a potential therapy for learning and memory deficits induced by METH.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the most robust neurobiological findings in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) over the last 40 years. The persistent increase in glucocorticoids levels induces morphological and anatomical changes in the brain, especially in the hippocampus. Ketamine represents a major advance for the treatment of MDD, however the psychotomimetic effects of this compound limit its widespread use. Agmatine is a neuromodulator that has been shown to be a putative novel and well-tolerated antidepressant/augmenter drug. In this study, the exposure of HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line to corticosterone (50 μM) induced a significant neuronal cell death. Interestingly, the incubation of HT22 cells with the fast-acting antidepressant drug ketamine (1 μM) prevented the corticosterone-induced toxicity. Similarly, agmatine caused a significant cytoprotection at the concentration of 0.1 μM against corticosterone (50 μM) cell damage. Notably, the incubation with a subthreshold concentration of ketamine (0.01 μM) in combination with a subthreshold concentration of agmatine (0.001 μM) prevented the neuronal damage elicited by corticosterone (50 μM). A 24 h co-incubation with subthreshold concentrations of ketamine (0.01 μM) and agmatine (0.001 μM) was able to cause a significant increase in the phosphorylation levels of Akt (Ser473) and p70S6 kinase (Thr389) as well as PSD95 immunocontent. Neither glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Ser9) phosphorylation nor β catenin immunocontent were altered by a 24 h co-incubation period. Finally, the co-incubation of cells for 30 min did not produce any effect in the phosphorylation or immunocontent of any protein investigated. Taken together, our results support the notion that the combination of subthreshold concentrations of ketamine and agmatine has cytoprotective effects against corticosterone-induced cell death. This effect is accompanied by its ability to activate Akt and mTOR/S6 kinase signaling pathway, and increase the expression of synaptic proteins.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine abstinence following chronic exposure is associated with impairments in memory and variety of cognitive functions. Daily nicotine (2 mg/kg, sc, four times daily) administration for 14 days and its abrupt withdrawal significantly impaired avoidance learning in inhibitory avoidance task as indicated by a significant decrease in the step through latency. Animals injected with agmatine (10-40 μg/rat, icv) from day 7 to 14 before the first daily dose of nicotine (2 mg/kg, sc) showed increased step through latencies during retrieval test. Similarly Intracerebroventricular injection of l-arginine (25-100 μg/rat), a biosynthetic precursor of agmatine and arcaine (50 μg -100 μg/rat), an agmatinase inhibitor, also increased the step through latency during retrieval test in nicotine withdrawn animals. In separate experiments, α2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0.5-1 μg/rat, icv) not only demonstrated significant increase in the step through latency as in nicotine withdrawn rats but also potentiated the pharmacological effect of agmatine. In contrast, pre-treatment of α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.5 μg/rat, icv) antagonized the memory enhancing effect of agmatine (20 μg/rat, icv) in nicotine withdrawn rats. In addition, brain agmatine analysis carried out at 72 h time point of nicotine withdrawal showed marked decrease in basal brain agmatine content as compared to control. Overall, the data indicate that agmatine attenuates nicotine withdrawal induced memory impairment through modulation of α2adrenergic receptors. Thus, agmatine might have therapeutic implications in the treatment of cognitive deficits following nicotine withdrawal.",

Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known side effect of cisplatin and has potential to result in limiting and/or reducing the dose, decreasing the quality of life. Thus, effective treatments are needed. Agmatine is an endogenous neuromodulator that has been shown to exert antiallodynic effects in various animal studies. The first aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of agmatine on cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) which are the primary target of drug injury were prepared. DRG cells were incubated with cisplatin (100, 200, 500 μm). Then, agmatine (10, 100, 500 μm) was administered with the submaximal concentration of cisplatin. Cisplatin caused concentration-dependent neurotoxicity, and agmatine did not alter this effect. The second aim was to investigate the effects of agmatine on cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats and the influence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME, in this effect. Female Sprague Dawley rats received intraperitoneal saline (control), cisplatin (3 mg/kg), cisplatin+agmatine (100 mg/kg), or cisplatin+agmatine+L-NAME (10 mg/kg) once a week for 5 weeks. The mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia [corrected], and tail clip tests were performed, and DRG cells and sciatic nerves were analyzed. Agmatine and agmatine+L-NAME combination attenuated CIS-induced mechanical allodynia and degeneration in DRG cells and sciatic nerves. However, L-NAME did not potentiate the antiallodynic or neuroprotective effect of agmatine. These findings indicate that agmatine co-administration ameliorates cisplatin-induced neuropathy and may be a therapeutic alternative.",

Therefore, plasma agmatine levels were evaluated in 34 patients with ASD and 28 non-ASD controls. Plasma agmatine levels were measured using the HPLC method. The study found remarkably lower agmatine levels in patients with ASD compared with the non-ASD control group (p < 0.001).

In this context it has emerged as an important mediator of addiction/satiety pathways associated with alcohol misuse. Consequently, the regulation of the activity of key enzymes in agmatine metabolism is an attractive strategy to combat alcoholism and related addiction disorders. Agmatine results from the decarboxylation of L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by arginine decarboxylase (ADC), and can be converted to either guanidine butyraldehyde by diamine oxidase (DAO) or putrescine and urea by the enzyme agmatinase (AGM) or the more recently identified AGM-like protein (ALP). In rat brain, agmatine, AGM and ALP are predominantly localised in areas associated with roles in appetitive and craving (drug-reinstatement) behaviors. Thus, inhibitors of AGM or ALP are promising agents for the treatment of addictions. In this review, the properties of DAO, AGM and ALP are discussed with a view to their role in the agmatine metabolism in mammals.",

In spinal cord injury, agmatine showed reduction of neuropathic pain, improvement of locomotor function, and neuroprotection. Macrophage is a key cellular component in neuroinflammation, a major cause of impairment after spinal cord injury. Macrophage has subtypes, M1 and M2 macrophages. M1 macrophage induces a pro-inflammatory response, but M2 inspires an anti-inflammatory response. In this study, it was clarified whether the neuroprotective effect of agmatine is related with the modulation of macrophage subdivision after spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury was induced in rats with contusion using MASCIS. Animals received agmatine (100 mg/kg, IP) daily for 6 days beginning the day after spinal cord injury. The proportion of M1 and M2 macrophages are confirmed with immunohistochemistry and FACS. CD206+ & ED1+ cells were counted as M2 macrophages. The systemic treatment of agmatine increased M2 macrophages caudal side to epicenter 1 week after spinal cord injury in immunohistochemistry. M2 macrophage related markers, Arginase-1 and CD206 mRNA, were increased in the agmatine treatment group and M2 macrophage expressing and stimulated cytokine, IL-10 mRNA, also was significantly overexpressed by agmatine injection. Among BMPs, BMP2/4/7, agmatine significantly increased only the expression of BMP2 known to reduce M1 macrophage under inflammatory status. These results suggest that agmatine reduces impairment after spinal cord injury through modulating the macrophage phenotype."

Here we describe methods to estimate urea and GABA that were suitably adapted from the published literature. The urea is determined by colorimetric assay using modified Archibald's method. However, the low sensitivity of this method often renders it impractical to perform fine kinetic analysis. To overcome this limitation, a high sensitive method for detecting GABA is exploited that can even detect 1 μM of GABA in the assay mixture. The samples are deproteinized by perchloric acid (PCA) and potassium hydroxide treatment prior to HPLC analysis of GABA. The method involves a pre-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) in combination with the thiol 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The fluorescent GABA derivative is then detected after reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using isocratic elution. The protocols described here are broadly applicable to other biological samples involving urea and GABA as metabolites.",

      "abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that agmatine inhibited opioid dependence, yet the neural mechanism remains unclear. Growing evidence showed that opioids decrease neurogenesis in the adult hippocampal subgranular zone by inhibiting neural progenitor proliferation. However, whether agmatine affects chronic opioid exposure-induced impairment to hippocampal neural progenitor cell proliferation remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of agmatine in hippocampal neural progenitors in morphine dependence rats. We found that chronic administration of morphine for 12 days induced morphine dependence in rats. This treatment not only decreased the proliferation of hippocampal neural progenitors in the granule cell layer, but also decreased the levels of hippocampal cAMP, pCREB and BDNF. However, these alterations can be restored to normal levels by co-treatment of agmatine (10mg/kg, s.c.). In vitro treatment with agmatine (10µM) for two days significantly increased proliferation of the cultured hippocampal neural progenitors. Concurrent treatment of agmatine (10µM) with morphine (10 or 50µM) reversed the supression of morphine-induced neural progenitor proliferation. In conclusion, we found that agmatine abolished chronic morphine-induced decrease in proliferation of hippocampal progenitors in vivo and in vitro, which may be due to the increase in cAMP-CREB-BDNF signaling. The enhancement of agmatine to proliferation of hippocampal progenitors may be one of the important mechanisms involved in the inhibition of morphine dependence by agmatine.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Oxidative stress and inflammatory response are major factors causing several tissue injuries in intestinal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Agmatine has been reported to attenuate I/R injury of various organs. The present study aims to analyze the possible protective effects of agmatine on intestinal I/R injury in rats. MAIN METHODS: Four groups were designed: sham control, agmatine-treated control, I/R control, and agmatine-treated I/R groups. IR injury of small intestine was induced by the occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for half an hour to be followed by a 3-hour-long reperfusion. Agmatine (10mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally before reperfusion period. After 180min of reperfusion period, the contractile responses to both carbachol and potassium chloride (KCl) were subsequently examined in an isolated-organ bath. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured in intestinal tissue. Plasma cytokine levels were determined. The expression of the intestinal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was also assessed by immunohistochemistry. KEY FINDINGS: The treatment with agmatine appeared to be significantly effective in reducing the MDA content and MPO activity besides restoring the content of GSH. The treatment also attenuated the histological injury. The increases in the I/R induced expressions of iNOS, IFN-γ, and IL-1α were brought back to the sham control levels by the treatment as well. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that the agmatine pretreatment may ameliorate reperfusion induced injury in small intestine mainly due to reducing inflammatory response and oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Agmatine is an endogenous neuromodulator that has been shown to have beneficial effects in the central nervous system, including antidepressant-like effects in animals. In this study, we investigated the ability of agmatine (0.1mg/kg, p.o.) and the conventional antidepressant fluoxetine (10mg/kg, p.o.) to reverse the behavioral effects and morphological alterations in the hippocampus of mice exposed to chronic corticosterone (20mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for a period of 21days as a model of stress and depressive-like behaviors. Chronic corticosterone treatment increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST), but did not cause anhedonic-like and anxiety-related behaviors, as assessed with the splash test and the open field test (OFT), respectively. Of note, the depressive-like behaviors induced by corticosterone were accompanied by a decrease in hippocampal cell proliferation, although no changes in hippocampal neuronal differentiation were observed. Our findings provide evidence that, similarly to fluoxetine, agmatine was able to reverse the corticosterone-induced depressive-like behaviors in the TST as well as the deficits in hippocampal cell proliferation. Additionally, fluoxetine but not agmatine, increased hippocampal differentiation. Agmatine, similar to fluoxetine, was capable of increasing both dendritic arborization and length in the entire dentate hippocampus, an effect more evident in the ventral portion of the hippocampus, as assessed with the modified Sholl analysis. Altogether, our results suggest that the increase in hippocampal proliferation induced by agmatine may contribute, at least in part, to the antidepressant-like response of this compound in this mouse model of stress induced by chronic exposure to corticosterone.",

Agmatine, an endogenous polyamine, exerts its diverse biological characteristics and therapeutic potential in varied aspects. METHODS: This review would focus on the neuroprotective actions of agmatine and its potential mechanisms in the setting of neurological diseases. RESULTS: Numerous studies had demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of agmatine in varied types of neurological diseases, including acute attack (stroke and trauma brain injury) and chronic neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease). The potential mechanism of agmatine induced neuroprotection includes anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, brain blood barrier (BBB) protection and brain edema prevention. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and low incidence of adverse effects indicate the vast potential therapeutic value of agmatine in the treatment of neurological diseases. However, most of the available studies relate to the agmatine are conducted in experimental models, more clinical trials are needed before the agmatine could be extensively clinically used.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease in which dysfunction of mitochondria play an important role, and disorders of lipid management intensify this process. Agmatine, an endogenous polyamine formed by decarboxylation of arginine, exerts a protective effect on mitochondria and modulates fatty acid metabolism. We investigated the effect of exogenous agmatine on the development of atherosclerosis and changes in lipid profile in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE-/-) mice. Agmatine caused an approximate 40% decrease of atherosclerotic lesions, as estimated by en face and cross-section methods with an influence on macrophage but not on smooth muscle content in the plaques. Agmatine treatment did not changed gelatinase activity within the plaque area. What is more, the action of agmatine was associated with an increase in the number of high density lipoproteins (HDL) in blood. Real-Time PCR analysis showed that agmatine modulates liver mRNA levels of many factors involved in oxidation of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry identified 27 differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins upon agmatine treatment in the liver of apoE-/- mice, mostly proteins related to metabolism and apoptosis. In conclusion, prolonged administration of agmatine inhibits atherosclerosis in apoE-/- mice; however, the exact mechanisms linking observed changes and elevations of HDL plasma require further investigation.",

Since then, a wide variety of agmatine-mediated effects have been observed, and consequently agmatine has moved from a wallflower existence into the limelight of clinical neuroscience research. Despite this quantum jump in scientific interest, the understanding of the anabolism and catabolism of this amine is still vague. The purification and biochemical characterization of natural mammalian arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase still are open issues. Nevertheless, the agmatinergic system is currently one of the most promising candidates in order to pharmacologically interfere with some major diseases of the central nervous system, which are summarized in the present review.

As per present scenario, none of the antiseizure drugs have been reported successful to have ameliorative effect on epilepsy associated depression and cognitive deficits. Thus, the study was envisioned to assess an ameliorative potential of agmatine on epilepsy and its efficacy and safety for management of associated depression and cognitive deficits. The animals were made epileptic employing pentylenetetrazole (35mg/kg i.p. every 48±2h) kindling model of epilepsy and subsequently were treated with vehicle, valproic acid (300mg/kg/day i.p.) and agmatine (2.5, 5, and 10mg/kg)/day/i.p. for 15days. Except naïve, all the groups were challenged with same pentylenetetrazole dose as employed during kindling on days 5, 10, and 15 to evaluate seizure severity. Two hours after seizure severity test, tail suspension test and passive shock avoidance paradigm was employed to evaluate depression and cognitive behavior respectively. Results suggested that epileptic animals were significantly associated with depression and cognitive impairment. Chronic valproate treatment significantly reduced seizure severity, but was found unable to mitigate depression and cognitive deficits. However, agmatine treatment dose dependently ameliorated seizure severity as well as associated depression and cognitive deficits. On 15th day, animals were euthanized and pertinent neurochemical estimations were carried out in cortical and hippocampal areas of the mice brain. Thus, study concluded that agmatine ameliorated seizure severity, depression and cognitive impairment in epileptic animals, possibly via restoring glutamate-GABA neurotransmission and serotonin synthesis with decreased nitrosative stress.",

Chronic stress is a risk factor for development of depression, anxiety and deterioration of cognitive performance. Compelling evidences indicate an involvement of nitric oxide (NO) pathway in these disorders. Hence, investigation of the beneficial effects of agmatine on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression, anxiety and cognitive performance with the involvement of nitrergic pathway was undertaken. Mice were subjected to a battery of stressors for 28days. Agmatine (20 and 40mg/kg, i.p.) alone and in combination with NO modulators like L-NAME (15mg/kg, i.p.) and l-arginine (400mg/kg i.p.) were administered daily. The results showed that 4-weeks CUMS produces significant depression and anxiety-like behaviour. Stressed mice have also shown a significant high serum corticosterone (CORT) and low BDNF level. Chronic treatment with agmatine produced significant antidepressant-like behaviour in forced swim test (FST) and sucrose preference test, whereas, anxiolytic-like behaviour in elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) with improved cognitive impairment in Morris water maze (MWM). Furthermore, agmatine administration reduced the levels of acetylcholinesterase and oxidative stress markers. In addition, agmatine treatment significantly increased the BDNF level and inhibited serum CORT level in stressed mice. Treatment with L-NAME (15mg/kg) potentiated the effect of agmatine whereas l-arginine abolished the anxiolytic, antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of agmatine. Agmatine showed marked effect on depression and anxiety-like behaviour in mice through nitrergic pathway, which may be related to modulation of oxidative-nitrergic stress, CORT and BDNF levels.",

In the present report, we have used microdialysis coupled to capillary electrophoresis to monitor microdialysate levels of GABA, glutamate and agmatine in the hippocampus of rats submitted to a KD for 15days compared to rats on a normal rat chow diet. A significant increase in GABA and agmatine levels while no change in glutamate levels was observed. These results support the notion that the KD modifies different transmitters favoring inhibitory over excitatory neurotransmitters.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one the world leading global burdens leading to various comorbidities. Lithium as a mainstay in the treatment of depression is still considered gold standard treatment. Similar to lithium another agent agmatine has also central protective role against depression. Since, both agmatine and lithium modulate various effects through interaction with NMDA receptor, therefore, in current study we aimed to investigate the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of agmatine with lithium in mouse force swimming test. Also to know whether if such effect is due to interaction with NMDA receptor. In our present study we found that when potent dose of lithium (30mg/kg) was administered, it significantly decreased the immobility time. Also, when subeffective dose of agmatine (0.01mg/kg) was coadministered with subeffective dose of lithium (3mg/kg), it potentiated the antidepressant-like effect of subeffective dose of lithium. For the involvement of NMDA receptor in such effect, we administered NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.05mg/kg) with a combination of subeffective dose of lithium (3mg/kg) and agmatine (0.001mg/kg). A significant antidepressant-like effect was observed. Furthermore, when subeffective dose (50 and 75mg/kg) of NMDA was given it inhibited the synergistic effect of agmatine (0.01mg/kg) with lithium (3mg/kg). Hence, our finding demonstrate that agmatine have synergistic effect with lithium which is mediated by NMDA receptor pathway.",

METHODS: The study was performed on 30 male Wistar albino rats split into: a control group, a sham-treated group, a study control group, an anastomosis group, and an anastomosis plus agmatine sulphate treatment group. The mandibular branch of the facial nerve was dissected, and a piece was removed for histological and electron microscopic examination. RESULTS: Regeneration was better in the anastomosis group than in the study control group. However, the best regeneration findings were seen in the agmatine sulphate treatment group. There was a significant difference between the agmatine group and the others in terms of median axon numbers (p < 0.004) and diameters (p < 0.004). CONCLUSION: Agmatine sulphate treatment with anastomosis in traumatic facial paralysis may enhance nerve regeneration.",

The rats were injected with CFA (0.1ml/rat) to induced symptoms of arthritis. Day 8 onwards of CFA administration, rats were injected daily with agmatine for next 7days, and arthritis score, body weights and food intake were monitored daily (g). Since cachexia is known to produce severe inflammation, malnutrition and inhibition of albumin gene expression, we have also monitored the total proteins, albumin, TNF-α and IL-6 levels in arthritic rats and its modulation by agmatine. In the present study, CFA treated rats showed a progressive reduction in both food intake and body weight. In addition analysis of blood serum of arthritis animals showed a significant reduction in proteins and albumin and significant elevation in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and Interleukins (IL)-6. Chronic agmatine (20-40mg/kg, ip) treatment not only attenuated the signs of arthritis but also reverses anorexia and body weight loss in CFA treated rats. In addition, agmatine restored total protein and albumin and reduces TNF-α and IL-6 levels in arthritis rats. These results suggest that agmatine administration can prevent the body weights loss and symptoms of arthritis via inhibition of inflammatory cytokines.",

It is responsible for more years lost to disability than any other disorder. Despite the fact that current available antidepressant drugs are safe and effective, they are far from ideal. In addition to the need to administer the drugs for weeks or months to obtain clinical benefit, side effects are still a serious problem. Agmatine is an endogenous polyamine synthesized by the enzyme arginine decarboxylase. It modulates several receptors and is considered as a neuromodulator in the brain. In this review, studies demonstrating the antidepressant effects of agmatine are presented and discussed, as well as, the mechanisms of action related to these effects. Also, the potential beneficial effects of agmatine for the treatment of other neurological disorders are presented. In particular, we provide evidence to encourage future clinical studies investigating agmatine as a novel antidepressant drug.",

      "abstract": "The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Previous studies in high-fat diet-induced AD animal models have shown that brain insulin resistance in these animals leads to the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and the reduction in GSK-3β phosphorylation, which promotes tau phosphorylation to cause AD. No therapeutic treatments that target AD in T2DM patients have yet been discovered. Agmatine, a primary amine derived from l-arginine, has exhibited anti-diabetic effects in diabetic animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of agmatine to treat AD induced by brain insulin resistance. ICR mice were fed a 60% high-fat diet for 12 weeks and received one injection of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg/ip) 4 weeks into the diet. After the 12-week diet, the mice were treated with agmatine (100 mg/kg/ip) for 2 weeks. Behaviour tests were conducted prior to sacrifice. Brain expression levels of the insulin signal molecules p-IRS-1, p-Akt, and p-GSK-3β and the accumulation of Aβ and p-tau were evaluated. Agmatine administration rescued the reduction in insulin signalling, which in turn reduced the accumulation of Aβ and p-tau in the brain. Furthermore, agmatine treatment also reduced cognitive decline. Agmatine attenuated the occurrence of AD in T2DM mice via the activation of the blunted insulin signal.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an immensely challenging developmental disorder characterized primarily by two core behavioral symptoms of social communication deficits and restricted/repetitive behaviors. Investigating the etiological process and identifying an appropriate therapeutic target remain as formidable challenges to overcome ASD due to numerous risk factors and complex symptoms associated with the disorder. Among the various mechanisms that contribute to ASD, the maintenance of excitation and inhibition balance emerged as a key factor to regulate proper functioning of neuronal circuitry. Interestingly, our previous study involving the valproic acid animal model of autism (VPA animal model) has demonstrated excitatory-inhibitory imbalance (E/I imbalance) due to enhanced differentiation of glutamatergic neurons and reduced GABAergic neurons. Here, we investigated the potential of agmatine, an endogenous NMDA receptor antagonist, as a novel therapeutic candidate in ameliorating ASD symptoms by modulating E/I imbalance using the VPA animal model. We observed that a single treatment of agmatine rescued the impaired social behaviors as well as hyperactive and repetitive behaviors in the VPA animal model. We also observed that agmatine treatment rescued the overly activated ERK1/2 signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of VPA animal models, possibly, by modulating over-excitability due to enhanced excitatory neural circuit. Taken together, our results have provided experimental evidence suggesting a possible therapeutic role of agmatine in ameliorating ASD-like symptoms in the VPA animal model of ASD.",

We have previously demonstrated that it can induce a rapid increase in BDNF levels after acute administration, suggesting that agmatine may be a fast-acting antidepressant. To investigate this hypothesis, the present study evaluated the effects of a single administration of agmatine in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a model of depression responsive only to chronic treatment with conventional antidepressants. The ability of agmatine to reverse CUS-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations was evaluated and compared with those elicited by the fast-acting antidepressant (ketamine) and the conventional antidepressant (fluoxetine). After exposed to CUS for 14days, mice received a single oral dose of agmatine (0.1mg/kg), ketamine (1mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10mg/kg), and were submitted to behavioral evaluation after 24h. The exposure to CUS caused an increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) but did not change anhedonic-related parameters in the splash test. Our findings provided evidence that, similarly to ketamine, agmatine is able to reverse CUS-induced depressive-like behavior in the TST. Western blot analyses of prefrontal cortex (PFC) demonstrated that mice exposed to CUS and/or treated with agmatine, fluoxetine or ketamine did not present alterations in the immunocontent of synaptic proteins [i.e. GluA1, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synapsin]. Altogether, our findings indicate that a single administration of agmatine is able to reverse behavioral alterations induced by CUS in the TST, suggesting that this compound may have fast-acting antidepressant-like properties. However, there was no alteration in the levels of synaptic proteins in the PFC, a result that need to be further investigated in other time points.",

The present work was planned to study the defending role of agmatine (AGM) on hepatic oxidative stress and damage induced by nicotine in rats. Thirty-two rats divided into four groups were employed: control group, nicotine-only group, AGM group, and AGM-nicotine group. Measurements of serum hepatic biochemical markers, lipid profile, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were done. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) activity, and nitrate/nitrite (NOx) levels were estimated in the liver homogenates. Immunohistochemistry for Bax and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) and histopathology of the liver were also included. Data of the study demonstrated that nicotine administration exhibited marked liver deterioration, an increase in liver enzymes, changes in lipid profile, and an elevation in MDA with a decline in levels of SOD, GSH, and NOx (nitrate/nitrite). Also, levels of proapoptotic Bax and profibrotic TGF-β1 showed marked elevation in the liver. AGM treatment to rats in nicotine-only group ameliorated all the previous changes. These findings indicate that AGM could successfully overcome the nicotine-evoked hepatic oxidative stress and tissue injury, apoptosis, and fibrosis.",

The metabolic pathways of CPZ toxicity were examined by monitoring oxidative/nitrosative stress markers. The aim of the study was to investigate the hypothesis that agmatine (AGM) prevents oxidative stress in the liver of Wistar rats 48 h after administration of CPZ. All tested compounds were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in one single dose. The animals were divided into control (C, 0.9% saline solution), CPZ (CPZ, 38.7 mg/kg b.w.), CPZ+AGM (AGM, 75 mg/kg b.w. immediately after CPZ, 38.7 mg/kg b.w. i.p.), and AGM (AGM, 75 mg/kg b.w.) groups. Rats were sacrificed by decapitation 48 h after treatment. The CPZ and CPZ+AGM treatments significantly increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), the nitrite and nitrate (NO2+NO3) concentration, and superoxide anion (O2•-) production in rat liver homogenates compared with C values. CPZ injection decreased the capacity of the antioxidant defense system: superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, total glutathione (GSH) content, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and glutathione reductase (GR) activity compared with the values of the C group. However, treatment with AGM increased antioxidant capacity in the rat liver; it increased the CAT activity, GSH concentration, GPx activity, and GR activity compared with the values of the CPZ rats. Immunohistochemical staining of ED1 in rats showed an increase in the number of positive cells 48 h after acute CPZ administration compared with the C group. Our results showed that AGM has no protective effects on parameters of oxidative and/or nitrosative stress in the liver but that it absolutely protective effects on the antioxidant defense system and restores the antioxidant capacity in liver tissue after administration of CPZ.",

Agmatine is a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator that has emerged as a potential agent to manage diverse central nervous system disorders. Agmatine has been shown to exert antidepressant-like effect. The present study investigated ability of agmatine to abolish the depressive-like behaviour induced by the administration of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. Agmatine (20 and 40mg/kg) was administered daily for 7days, then the mice were challenged with saline or LPS (0.83mg/kg; i.p.) on the 7th day. After 24h of LPS administration we tested mice for depressive-like behaviour. LPS treated animals presented an increase in immobility time in the forced-swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) which was reversed by agmatine pre-treatment (20 and 40mg/kg). Oxidative/nitrosative stress evoked by LPS was ameliorated by both doses of agmatine in hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Administration of LPS caused an increase in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), whereas BDNF was down regulated in the HC. Agmatine pre-treatment at 40mg/kg ameliorated LPS-induced neuroinflammation by attenuating brain IL-1β and TNF-α level. In addition, agmatine pre-treatment also up-regulated the BDNF level in the HC. The present study shows that pre-treatment of agmatine is able to abolish the behavioural responses in the FST and TST elicited by the LPS-induced model of depression that may depend on the inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduction of oxidative stress as well as activation neuroplasticity-related signalling in mice, suggesting that agmatine may constitute an monotherapy/adjuvant for the management of depression associated with inflammation.",
