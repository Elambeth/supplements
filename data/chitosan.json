      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The current literature lacks the effect of melatonin loaded nanoparticles (LNPs) as local drug delivery (LDD) in the treatment of periodontitis. Hence, the aim of the current study is to investigate the clinical and radiographic effects of melatonin LNPs in patients with periodontal intrabony defects. METHODS: The current study was performed on healthy patients with periodontal intrabony defects. The participants were randomly allocated into 3 groups. Group 1 received scaling and root planing (SRP) with melatonin LNPs, group 2 received placebo gel with SRP, and group 3 received SRP and chitosan LNPs. The primary outcomes included the radiographic measurements of the bone defects to evaluate the bone fill after 6 months. The secondary outcomes included the following clinical parameters; clinical attachment level (CAL), periodontal probing depth (PPD), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI). The clinical parameters were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. RESULTS: The current study included 67 patients with periodontal intrabony defects. All the study groups demonstrated significant improvements in all the clinical outcomes (CAL, PPD, PI, and GI) (P < 0.05). Melatonin LNPs group revealed the most significant improvement of the radiographic outcomes after 6 months including bone defect height and depth, alveolar crest level, and the buccolingual and mesiodistal width of bone defects) (P < 0.05), followed by chitosan group while insignificant changes were detected in the placebo group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Melatonin LNPs as a LDD can act as a promising therapeutic modality in treating periodontal intrabony defects through significant improvement of the clinical and radiographic outcomes."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains as a major health problem with high lethality rate in the world. The innovate therapeutic strategies are essential in CRC management. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of chitosan nanoparticle containing Campylobacter jejuni culture supernatant (CNP/Cj-sup) on genes involved in CRC signaling pathways. CNP/Cj-sup was fabricated via ionotropic gelation method. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were employed to characterize of the CNP/Cj-sup including the electrical charge, size distribution, and morphological properties. The loaded protein, released protein, and entrapment efficacy (EE) were assayed utilizing a BCA assay kit. After the evaluation of the viability of Caco-2 (colon adenocarcinoma) and HDF (human dermal fibroblasts) cells against CNP/Cj-sup by MTT assay, subsequently anti-tumor effect of CNP/Cj-sup on genes associated with CRC signaling pathways was assessed via real-time PCR method. The size dispersion of CNP/Cj-sup was 400.6 ± 24.4 nm with an electrical charge of + 4.5 mV. The loaded protein was calculated 1100 µg. The release rate of protein from CNP/Cj-sup was 78% at pH of 6.8 after 48 h, with EE of 74.62%. The viability of Caco-2 and HDF cells against CNP/Cj-sup (1100 µg + 0.05%) was measured 75.8 and 96.5%, respectively after 48 h. CNP/Cj-sup exhibited the highest efficacy in inhibiting the expression of oncogenes TGF-α, Bcl2, TLR4, CEA, TGF-β, and PI3K by to 0.06, 0.34, 0.14, 0.13, 0.08, and 0.14-fold (p value < .0001). Moreover, it led to a significant increase in the expression of the suppressor genes caspase9 and PTEN by to 55.7 and 1.8- fold (p value < .0001). CNP/Cj-sup demonstrated the highest efficiency in suppressing TGF-α and enhancing caspase9 compared to CNP and Cj-sup. In conclusion, CNP/Cj-sup as an innovative potential anticancer agent, with the ability to modulate genes involved in CRC progression, represents a promising approach to CRC treatment.

      "abstract": "The management of infected chronic wounds is one of the urgent challenges. Herein, a hesperidin (Hes)-loaded self-assembled supramolecular hydrogel based on quaternized chitosan (CQHP) has been developed as an efficient photothermal antibacterial dressing for MRSA-infected wound healing. Specifically, CQHP hydrogels fabricated through the dynamic noncovalent interactions among CM-β-CD grafted QCS, Hes, proline and Fe3+, exhibited injectable and self-healing behaviors, along with adhesion, antioxidant, hemostatic and protein adsorption performance, satisfying the essential feature as chronic wound dressing. Of note, superior photothermal effect generated from the Hes-Fe3+ has been demonstrated, which endowed the CQHP hydrogels effectively and rapidly eliminate the E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA through photothermal therapy, thereby avoiding the use of antibiotics or photothermal conversion nanomaterials in hydrogels and substantially reducing the biological toxicity. Furtherly, sustained antibacterial performance in the absence of NIR can be achieved through the inherent antibacterial activities of Hes. Importantly, the developed CQHP hydrogels significantly promoted the closure of acute full-thickness scratch wounds, and exhibited remarkable better therapeutic effect on MRSA-infected wound than commercial 3M transparent film, by efficiency and sustained antibacterial activity, reducing inflammation, enhancing angiogenesis and collagen deposition, highlighting its promising application in the MRSA-infected wound healing with high efficiency, quality and security.",

      "abstract": "The current limitations of oral nanomedicines such as aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and antibiotics include the toxic byproducts from nanocarrier synthesis, poor targeting and retention within the inflamed colon, delayed release at inflammation sites, susceptibility to gastric degradation, reduced efficacy under hypoxic conditions, MUC2 homeostasis disruption, and insufficiently addressing the disease's root causes. This research presents an innovative approach of using non-toxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible Maillard reaction-based nanoparticles (MPs) for targeted oral drug delivery in IBD therapy. Through the development of mucoadhevise chitosan-bovine serum albumin Maillard nanoparticles shielded with biocompatible, non-toxic, non-immunogenic, gastroprotective pectin (P@CMPs) encapsulating with chrysin, a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and hyperoxia properties whose bioavailability is negatively affected by gastric degradation. P@CMPs had a spherical, uniform 300 nm hydrodynamic diameter, confirmed by TEM and FESEM. Chrysin encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were ∼96 % and 16 %, respectively, demonstrating effective nanoparticle formulation The P@CMPs is designed to withstand the gastrointestinal environment, ensuring targeted delivery and prolonged retention in inflamed colonic regions. In a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse model, P@CMPs markedly mitigated inflammation, suppressed proinflammatory cytokine levels, and augmented the expression of MUC2, a crucial factor for maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier. By employing non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable materials, our P@CMPs approach offers a promising avenue for advancing IBD treatment, addressing various challenges and precise oral delivery within the gastrointestinal system.",

      "abstract": "The primary cause of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disorders is hyperlipidemia. Ellagic Acid (EA) is a naturally occurring polyphenol found in fruits and nuts. This medication has garnered attention due to its possible therapeutic benefits, encompassing the treatment of hyperlipidemia. In this study, ellagic acid was incorporated into a nanocarrier system using chitosan, a biodegradable polymer, via an ionotropic gelation technique, aiming to enhance its solubility and bioavailability. The effects of ellagic acid-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (EA-CS-NPs) were evaluated in a hyperlipidemic mouse model induced by poloxamer 407 (PL-407). Administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of 300 mg/kg body weight of PL-407 resulted in the induction of hyperlipidemia. The mice were grouped into five groups: Control, PL-407, EA-free drug, blank CS-NPs, and EA-CS-NPs. Serum analysis included the measurement of liver function biomarkers, lipid profiles, and liver antioxidant capacity. Additionally, a histopathological evaluation of liver tissue was performed. This study showed that PL-407 treatment increased hepatic oxidative stress and serum lipid biomarkers, with significant liver tissue changes in hyperlipidemic mice. EA-CS-NPs exerted the most protective effects, improving hepatic antioxidant capacity, serum lipid profile, and hepatic histological changes, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic approach for hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "Due to poor angiogenesis under the wound bed, wound treatment remains a clinical challenge. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new dressings to combat bacterial infections, accelerate angiogenesis, and accelerate wound healing. In this study, we prepared carbon dots nanomaterial (PF-CDs) derived from traditional Chinese medicine paeoniflorin using a simple green one pot hydrothermal method. The average particle size of the carbon dots we prepared was 4 nm, and a concentration of 200 μg/ml was ultimately selected for experiments. Subsequently, PF-CDs were loaded into the chitosan hydrogel to form a new type of wound dressing CSMA@PF-CDs hydrogel. CSMA@PF-CDs demonstrated positive biocompatibility by promoting a 20 % increase in cell proliferation and strong antibacterial activity. In comparison to the control group, CSMA@PF-CDs enhanced the expression level of anti-inflammatory factors by at least 2.5 times and reduces the expression level of pro-inflammatory factors by at least 3 times. Furthermore, CSMA@PF-CDs promoted the migration of Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by 5 times. The results of in vivo experiments indicate that CSMA@PF-CDs significantly promoted the healing of back wounds in rats. These characteristics make it a promising material for repairing infected wounds and a potential candidate for clinical skin regeneration applications."

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of chitosan (CS) on fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity. 28 rats were divided into four groups (n = 7). The Control group received drinking water. Sodium fluoride (NaF) group received 100 mg/L NaF in drinking water. NaF + CS group received 100 mg/L NaF and 250 mg/kg/day CS by gastric gavage. CS group was given 250 mg/kg/day CS by gavage. The study period lasted 12 weeks. Total kidney volume, Bowman's capsule volume, Bowman's space volume, Tubular volume and Glomerulus volume were measured by stereological methods. Immunohistochemically, caspase-3 and TNF-alpha expressions were evaluated. Biochemically, levels of urea and creatinine were measured. In addition, a histopathological evaluation of the kidney was performed. According to the control group, an increase was observed in all stereological parameters except glomerulus volume in the NaF group. CS treatment inhibited the increase in stereological parameters. Fluoride increased expressions of caspase-3 and TNF-α in the kidney, and serum urea and creatine levels, but CS decreased these parameters. In addition, pathological changes in the kidney caused by fluoride such as tubular dilatation, enlargement of the Bowman's space, and deterioration in tubular epithelial cells were restored with CS treatment. The conclusions of the current study reveal that fluoride can cause nephrotoxicity and CS treatment can prevent fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD), is a significant public health concern caused by Leishmania protozoa. It is transmitted through the bites of infected female sandflies and manifests in various forms, ranging from localized skin ulcers to social stigma due to scarring. Numerous reports highlight the life-threatening side effects of glucantim, the first-line treatment for this disease, indicating a pressing need foralternative drugs. This experimental study aims to assess the anti-leishmanial effects of chitosan and chitosan- amphotericin B against Leishmania major (L. major) in vitro and in vivo. Chitosan and amphotricine B were purchased, and different concentrations were prepared. L. major promastigotes were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium. In vitro anti-leishmanial activity was assessed against the promastigotes of L. major using vital staining. For the in vivo assessment, lesion sizes were measured before and after ointment treatments in Bagg Albino mice (BALB/c). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was utilized to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of chitosan and chitosan-amphotericin B at varying concentrations on the L929 cell line. Additionally, the in vitro hemolytic activity was measured using a spectrophotometric method. The in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that chitosan-amphotericin B exhibited superior inhibitory effects against L. major compared to either chitosan or amphotericin B alone, and even against the positive control, particularly at higher concentrations (P < 0.05). Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests indicated that both chitosan and amphotericin, whether used separately or in combination, had no cytotoxic effects on the L929 cell line or human blood samples in vitro and did not impact liver enzymes in vivo (P < 0.05). The findings from this in vitro and in vivo study highlighted the impressive anti-leishmanial effects of chitosan, which were further enhanced with the addition of amphotericin B."

In this work, insect chitosan, yielded via heterogeneous and homogeneous deacetylation from larvae, pupal exuviae, and adults, was studied as an immunomodulatory agent. The inflammatory response of immortalized human keratinocyte cells was induced by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide. After that, the ability of the biopolymer to reduce the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-1α, and TNF-α was tested after 6 and 24 h of treatment. Insect chitosan samples effectively downregulated cytokine expression, with improved activity obtained from heterogeneous chitosan treatments."

      "abstract": "Wastewater containing heavy metals and organic dye pollutants discharged into receiving waters poses a serious environmental concern. Herein, a novel EDTA-chitosan/alginate porous composite bead adsorbent (EC-AB) was reported for the simultaneous removal of lead (Pb(ii)) and methyl blue (MB) complexes from wastewater. Characterization results showed that EC-AB contained plenty of oxygen/nitrogen functional groups. The effect of CaCO3 addition, pH of the initial solution, contact time, initial pollutant concentration, and ionic strength on EC-AB pollutant removal performance and the adsorption mechanism were systematically analyzed. These findings indicated that EC-AB exhibited high removal efficiency over a wide pH range and at high ionic strength. The maximum adsorption capacities of EC-AB for Pb(ii) and MB were 504.11 mg g-1 and 660.76 mg g-1, respectively, at 298 K. Adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies indicated that the adsorption well fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm. A possible adsorption mechanism involving electrostatic attraction, chelation, ion exchange, H-bonding and synergistic effects was proposed. Moreover, EC-AB showed superior stability and reusability, with removal efficiencies of 76.64% for Pb(ii) and 80.29% for MB after five continuous adsorption-desorption cycles for treating complex wastewater. In summary, this work provides a beneficial strategy for designing high-performance adsorbents for the treatment of wastewater."

      "abstract": "Quercetin as a flavonoid polyphenol in nature has shown great anti-obesity effects. Due to its poor stability in chemical structure and low intestinal absorption, the in vivo bioavailability of quercetin is considered to be the main challenge for applications. To achieve the oral quercetin administration, chitosan was successfully trimethylated (TMC) to coat the quercetin-loaded zein nanoparticles (Zein-Q), which were designed as the core-shell structure for enhancing the intestinal absorption in this study. TMC-Zein-Q was demonstrated to protect quercetin from degradation and showed the sustained-release effect in an in vitro drug release experiment. The nanoparticles were found to reversibly open tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells and help to increase quercetin uptake via the paracellular pathway in Caco-2 cells. In addition, the delivery system also showed stronger intestinal permeability and mucoadhesion in vivo, which improved the bioavailability of quercetin in cellular and animal experiments. After 10 weeks of intervention, TMC-Zein-Q could effectively suppress weight gain, improve serum lipid levels, and ameliorate hepatic steatosis and glucose tolerance in high-fat diet (HFD) mice by mediating the AMPK pathway. Consequently, this work successfully constructed TMC-Zein-Q for oral quercetin delivery, providing a novel and feasible strategy for the treatment of obesity via the oral route."

However, natural periosteum is difficult to meet clinical requirements due to its low availability. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a tissue engineering strategy of biomimetic periosteum for bone defect repair. METHODS: Poly-ε-caprolactone/chitosan/Whitlockite electrospun bionic membrane (PCL/CS/WH) was prepared using electrospinning technology, then it was conjugated with an E7 peptide as PCL/CS/WH/E7 bionic membrane. The physical properties of the membranes were evaluated by TEM, FTIR and tensile strength testing. In vitro, LIVE/DEAD staining and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are used to assess the biocompatibility of bionic membranes. Matrigel was applied to evaluate the ability of the different composite nanofibers samples to promote angiogenesis. Mineralized nodule and collagen formation in the BMSCs was detected by alizarin red staining and sirius red staining respectively. The expression of osteogenesis related genes and angiogenesis associated genes were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In vivo, the ability of PCL/CS/WH/E7 membrane to promote bone regeneration and angiogenesis was assessed by Micro-CT and associated staining. RESULT: The addition of chitosan (CS) and E7 peptide (E7) enhanced the hydrophilicity and cytocompatibility of pure PCL membranes. Additionally, CS, E7 and Mg2+ released from Whitlockite (WH) had a synergistic effect to promote angiogenesis and osteogenic differentiation. Three weeks after implantation, the membrane successfully bridged the bone defect and significantly promoted the formation of new bone and blood vessels. CONCLUSION: The PCL/CS/WH/E7 membrane to achieve efficient repair of bone tissue and enriches clinical solutions for the treatment of critical bone defects.",

      "abstract": "Deep trauma often leads to acute bleeding and infections, which are major causes of death. It is worth exploring the preparation of hemostatic materials and improving their hemostatic and antibacterial properties applied to deep trauma by green and efficient methods. In this study, porous chitosan/zinc oxide/alkylated chitosan (CS/ZnO/ACS) sponges were prepared by a freezing phase separation method. ACS induced the formation of stable foam, increasing the pore formation during the freezing phase separation process. The porous structure enabled the sponge to rapidly absorb blood and expand to close the wound. The in situ synthesis of ZnO within the sponge enhances its antibacterial properties. In the antibacterial test against S. aureus and E. coli, the CS/ZnO/ACS sponges can effectively inhibit bacterial growth. Besides, compared with CS sponges, the introduction of ACS increases the adhesion of the CS/ZnO/ACS sponges to blood cells and promotes coagulation. In addition, the CS/ZnO/ACS sponges were prepared by physical phase separation, which endows it with increased solubility under acidic conditions and can be quickly removed after hemostasis. Therefore, the CS/ZnO/ACS expandable sponges offer promising clinical applications for the treatment of deep trauma."

The BCR1 gene plays a critical role in regulating virulence factors in this species. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Thymus daenensis essential oil encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles (TDNs) on the expression of the BCR1 gene in C. parapsilosis isolates from animal and human sources. Sixty C. parapsilosis isolates (30 from human and 30 from veterinary sources) were screened for the presence of the BCR1 gene via PCR. The TDNs were synthesized and characterized using various techniques. The isolates carrying the BCR1 gene were treated with TDNs to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The expression of the BCR1 gene after treatment with sub-MIC concentrations of TDNs was measured by real-time PCR and compared with the control group. The results were statistically analyzed. Five out of 60 isolates (8.33%) tested positive for the BCR1 gene. The physical properties of TDNs showed that they had a spherical shape, an average size of 92.3 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.129±0.03, a zeta potential of +48.3 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency of 88.6 ± 0.2%. The MIC range for TDNs in these isolates was 0.032-1 μg/ml. Treatment with TDNs significantly reduced the expression of the BCR1 gene in all five isolates compared with the control group (p=0.012). TDN has substantial potential for inhibiting the expression of the BCR1 gene, associated with virulence in C. parapsilosis. This may enhance the antifungal activity of TDN and reduce the risk of nosocomial infections caused by this species.",

The preparation involved synthesizing chitosan beads, modifying them with hexanediamine to enhance adsorption capacity and subsequently loading them with zinc ions. The effects of the HDA spacer, Zn2+ concentration, and adsorption time on the adsorption percentage for testosterone were systematically investigated through a series of adsorption experiments. Results indicated that the Zn2+ -HDA-CS beads achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of approximately 35% within 90 min. The analysis of plasma concentrations of Zn2+ , albumin, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) indicated that the adsorption process involved a complex interaction between testosterone-bound SHBG and albumin for Zn2+ binding sites on the beads. Additionally, the adsorbent demonstrated good storage stability and selectivity for testosterone, with minimal impact on total protein content in plasma. These findings highlight the potential of Zn2+ -HDA-CS beads as an effective therapeutic option for managing testosterone levels in clinical settings, particularly in patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several traditional dressings may have limitation in treating wounds. A novel chitosan-based dressing designed for improved hemostasis, moisture, and sealing shows promise in wound healing. However, its efficacy and safety are yet to be sufficiently verified in patients. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 40 patients suffering from acute skin wounds in the limbs from 12/2022 to 12/2023. They were randomly divided into two groups (20 vs. 20) and received regular treatments in the Shenzhen Second People's Hospital. The experimental group was treated with chitosan-based liquid dressing, whereas the control group was treated with traditional dressing with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF). The therapeutic effects (scar area and pigment deposition), adverse events, visual analogue scale (VAS), healing time, cost, and the patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS) were evaluated on days 0, 7, 14, and 28. RESULTS: No adverse events were observed throughout the trial. On day 28, effective rate between groups were not statistically significant between the groups (70% vs. 85%, p = 0.256). Other parameters that were not significant included VAS (5.10 ± 1.62 vs. 6.35 ± 2.39, p = 0.06), healing time (8.45 ± 4.26 vs. 8.60 ± 5.44 days, p = 0.923), and cost (49.00 ± 22.48 vs. 57.40 ± 27.59, p = 0.298). However, on day 28, the patient- and observer-reported SAS of the chitosan (CS) group was significantly lower than that of the rhEGF group (12.00 vs. 9.50, z = 2.477, p = 0.013; 18.50 vs. 12.50, z = 2.209, p = 0.026; respectively), and the total POSAS (30.50 vs. 22.00, z = 2.374, p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Compared to rhEGF, the CS-based liquid dressing showed reliable safety and equivalent performance in treating acute limb skin wounds, as revealed by improvements in healing time and rate, pain relief, and costs. Moreover, liquid dressing significantly reduced scar formation, indicating its potential in wound therapy."

      "abstract": "Loss of periodontal tissue due to persistent inflammation in periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. Overcoming osteogenic inhibition in the inflammatory periodontal environment and restoring the regenerative capacity of endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) remain critical challenges in current treatment approaches. Macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key regulators of osteogenesis in recipient cells, yet the role of erythropoietin (EPO) in modifying macrophages and the function of their EVs in bone regeneration remain unclear. In this study, EVs from EPO-stimulated macrophages (EPO-EVs) are isolated, and they are encapsulated in a chitosan/β-sodium glycerophosphate/gelatin (CS/β-GP/gelatin) hydrogel to create a controlled-release EVs delivery system for localized periodontal environment. EPO-EVs restore the osteogenic function of mouse BMSCs (mBMSCs) and mitigate inflammatory bone loss in a periodontitis mouse model. Mechanistically, miR-5107-5p, significantly enriched in EPO-EVs, is delivered to mBMSCs, where it suppresses epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and alleviates EGFR's inhibitory effect on RhoA. This process counteracts osteogenic inhibition in inflammatory settings through the EGFR/RhoA axis. Overall, EVs from EPO pretreated macrophages restore the osteogenic capacity of mBMSCs under inflammation by inhibiting EGFR expression, providing new insight into therapeutic mechanisms and offering a promising approach for future periodontitis treatment."

METHODS: One hundred and twenty extracted human teeth were prepared up to size #100 to mimic the open apex. Root canals were irrigated with 20 mL 1.5% NaOCl according to the RETs protocol. Teeth were divided into 3 main groups according to the irrigation solution (17% EDTA, 0.2% chitosan nanoparticles, and the combination of EDTA + chitosan nanoparticles) and 5 subgroups based on the activation methods (syringe-needle irrigation (SNI), Irriflex, PUI, EDDY, and SWEEPS). TGF-β1 release was measured on days 1 and 7 using ELISA. Data were analyzed with the significance level set at p<.05. RESULTS: TGF-β1 release increased progressively from SNI to Irriflex, PUI, EDDY, and SWEEPS, with SWEEPS achieving the highest release at both time points (p<.05). The combination of EDTA and chitosan nanoparticles yielded significantly higher TGF-β1 levels compared to EDTA or chitosan nanoparticles alone, particularly with SWEEPS and EDDY (p<.05). The percentage increase in TGF-β1 release from day 1 to day 7 was significantly higher in all activation groups (p<.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of EDTA and chitosan nanoparticles, particularly when used with advanced irrigation activation methods such as SWEEPS and EDDY, significantly increased TGF-β1 release from dentin. These results suggest that both the choice of irrigant and activation method can influence growth factor release in RETs."

By combining chemodynamic therapy, starvation therapy, and photothermal therapy, our approach aims to activate drug release and generate reactive oxygen species within the TME. Specifically, we developed a fucoidan-chitosan (F/CS) nanocarrier loaded with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (T), Prussian blue (P), and glucose oxidase (GOx) (F/CS@TPGOx). It has been reported that fucoidan and chitosan target P-selectin and the glucose-rich microenvironment of pathological cancer. Furthermore, F/CS@TPGOx at a concentration of 4 µg/mL was observed to reduce cancer cell viability to less than 20 % following a four-hour incubation period. This indicates that fucoidan, the carrier, exhibits anticancer activity that is more pronounced than that observed in conventional anticancer nanocarriers. The findings demonstrated the efficacy of F/CS@TPGOx in cancer cell death in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This suggests F/CS@TPGOx as a promising material for targeted cancer therapy with the potential to be used in clinical biomedicine as a therapeutic platform with high efficacy and minimal side effects."

This study presents a novel drug delivery system using a chitosan (CS)/agarose (AG) scaffold incorporating oleic acid-coated magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs/OA) for controlled doxorubicin release. Hydrothermally synthesized MNPs were functionalized with oleic acid, a biocompatible surfactant, to improve stability before incorporation into a chitosan-agarose (CS-AG) matrix. The formation of the composite AG-CS-MNPs/OA was characterized and verified using different methods, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM). Chitosan is a valuable biomaterial due to its pH sensitivity, natural origin, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and bio adhesive properties. In-vitro drug release experiments revealed a pH-dependent behavior, with increased DOX release observed under acidic conditions (pH = 4.5), which are characteristic of tumor sites, compared to a neutral (pH = 7.4). The release dynamics, best captured by the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, indicated a Fickian diffusion mechanism. Cytotoxicity assessments on MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed enhanced drug effectiveness at acidic pH, supporting the concept of targeted delivery. These findings suggest that the chitosan/agarose-magnetite scaffold is a promising candidate for pH-sensitive, controlled drug delivery, potentially enhancing cancer treatment by minimizing adverse effects on healthy tissues."

The viability of human skin fibroblast cells was higher than the control for all films, and antibacterial activity of the film FOPL3 was significantly higher compared to other films. Wound healing effect of FOPL3 film was evaluated in a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) infected full-thickness skin defect model in mice. The results showed a significantly lower wound area after 7,10,14 days of treatment compared to the control group treated by normal saline.

However, its therapeutic use is often limited by gastrointestinal irritation and low bioavailability. This study aimed to evaluate the biocompatibility, release kinetics, and analgesic potential of IND-loaded chitosan (CHIT)-stabilized lipid vesicles (IND-ves) in comparison to free IND, focusing on their in vivo effects and impact on somatic nociceptive reactivity in mice. Methods: IND-ves were prepared using a molecular droplet self-assembly technique, followed by CHIT coating to enhance stability and control drug release. Mice were administered either free IND or IND-ves, and various physiological parameters, including liver and kidney function, oxidative stress markers, immune cell activity, and histopathological changes in key organs, were assessed. Plasma drug release kinetics and analgesic effects were evaluated using the tail-flick test. Results: Both IND and IND-ves demonstrated good biocompatibility, with no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or immunological profiles. IND-ves exhibited a sustained release profile, with drug release initiating at 30 min and peaking at 3 h, while free IND displayed a rapid release and potential gastric mucosal damage. IND-ves did not induce oxidative stress or inflammation and maintained organ integrity, particularly protecting against gastric injury. Additionally, the prolonged release profile of IND-ves contributed to extended analgesic effects in the tail-flick test. Conclusions: CHIT-stabilized lipid vesicles offer a promising drug delivery system for IND, enhancing drug release, prolonging analgesic efficacy, and minimizing gastrointestinal irritation. These findings suggest that IND-ves could serve as a safer and more effective alternative for NSAID therapy."

Alectinib, a second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, is effective in ALK-positive NSCLC; however, its clinical potential is hampered by poor aqueous solubility and limited oral bioavailability. This study aimed to develop Alectinib-loaded chitosan-alginate nanoparticles (ACANPs) to enhance its solubility, oral bioavailability, and therapeutic efficacy. Methods: ACANPs were synthesized using a novel combined solid/oil/water (s/o/w) emulsification technique with ionotropic gelation. Characterization was performed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential measurements. A validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method quantified the Alectinib. In vitro drug release studies compared free Alectinib with ACANPs. Cytotoxicity against NSCLC cell lines (A549 and H460) was assessed using MTT assays. Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in rats using LC-MS/MS. Results: ACANPs showed a high encapsulation efficiency (~97%), an average particle size of 161 nm, and a positive zeta potential of +21 mV. In vitro release studies revealed a threefold increase in drug release from ACANPs over 48 h compared to free Alectinib. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated significantly reduced IC50 values for ACANPs. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed an enhanced maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC), indicating a 78% increase in oral bioavailability. Conclusions: ACANPs substantially improved the solubility, cytotoxic efficacy, and oral bioavailability of Alectinib, suggesting their potential as a promising nanocarrier system for enhancing NSCLC treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The safe completion of a non-invasive procedure is crucial to the success of an endovascular approach. Chitosan, a natural polysaccharide derived from chitin, is an ideal material for the study and application of medical devices in post-operative wound management. Methods: The present work is based on a retrospective study conducted on a sample of patients treated with Axiostat (a sterile, single-use, non-absorbable dressing), composed of 100% chitosan and designed to instantly stop bleeding through a mucus adhesion mechanism for the treatment of conditions such as Leriche's syndrome. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the hemostatic Axiostat dressing in patients undergoing anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy in whom endovascular procedures using the axillary artery as an access site are performed to treat Leriche syndrome. Results: The obtained results showed that Axiostat is safe and effective in promoting hemostasis at the axillary vascular access site even when prolonged hemostasis was required in patients on antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. The mean time to hemostasis was 5.75 min in all types of patients considered."

      "abstract": "Despite improvements in therapeutic approaches like immunotherapy and gene therapy, cancer still remains a serious threat to world health due to its high incidence and mortality rates. Limitations of conventional therapy include suboptimal targeting, multidrug resistance, and systemic toxicity. A major challenge in current oncology therapies is the development of new delivery methods for antineoplastic drugs that act directly on target. One approach involves the complexation of antitumor drugs with cyclodextrins (CDs) and chitosan (CS) as an attempt to counteract their primary limitations: low water solubility and bioavailability, diminished in vitro and in vivo stability, and high dose-dependent toxicity. All those drawbacks may potentially exclude some therapeutic candidates from clinical trials, thus their integration into smart delivery systems or drug-targeting technologies must be implemented. We intended to overview new drug delivery systems based on chitosan or cyclodextrins with regard to the current diagnosis and cancer management. This narrative review encompasses full-length articles published in English between 2019 and 2025 (including online ahead of print versions) in PubMed-indexed journals, focusing on recent research on the encapsulation of diverse antitumor drugs within those nanosystems that exhibit responsiveness to various stimuli such as pH, redox potential, and folate receptor levels, thereby enhancing the release of bioactive compounds at tumor sites. The majority of the cited references focus on the most notable research, studies of novel applications, and scientific advancements in the field of nanostructures and functional materials employed in oncological therapies over the last six years. Certainly, there are additional stimuli with research potential that can facilitate the drug's release upon activation, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), various enzymes, ATP level, or hypoxia; however, our review exclusively addresses the aforementioned stimuli presented in a comprehensive manner."

      "abstract": "Postharvest preservation of fruits is one of the key issues in the current agriculture and food processing industry. Surface coating treatment, a promising technology for postharvest fruit preservation, has gathered significant attention due to its ability to reduce water loss, regulate gas exchange, and inhibit respiration, thereby achieving postharvest fruit preservation. Among them, chitosan-based coating has a wide application prospect due to its superior film-forming capability, high biosecurity, wide range of sources, etc. This review summarizes the structural features, physicochemical properties, modification strategies, and preservation mechanisms of chitosan-based coatings, focusing on their applications in postharvest fruit storage. Unlike prior works, it highlights advanced modifications (e.g., nanocomposite, multifunctional grafting) that enhance antimicrobial activity, mechanical strength, and environmental adaptability. Challenges in fruit preservation-such as microbial resistance and stability-are analyzed, with solutions proposed via material innovation. The discussion on industrial scalability emphasizes chitosan's biodegradability, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with sustainable agriculture, while addressing technical bottlenecks. This work bridges fundamental research and practical use, advancing chitosan-based coatings toward greener, safer, and scalable postharvest solutions."

To analyze the physicochemical changes in nanocomposite before and after CR adsorption SEM-EDS, FTIR, XRD, BET, and VSM were employed. The results revealed that Fe3O4-CS/Bent nanocomposite shows significantly enhanced surface area, pore volume, and adsorption capacity compared to pure Fe3O4 NPs, making it highly effective for environmental remediation. Despite its lower magnetization due to non-magnetic additives, it retains superparamagnetic properties that facilitate efficient magnetic separation in water treatment. Furthermore, the mesoporous Fe3O4-CS/Bent nanocomposite can adsorb CR through electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bondings, and surface interaction under carefully optimized adsorption conditions (pH 5, adsorbent amount of 9 mg, and contact time of 25 min) via multivariate analyses. Subsequently, the adsorption process followed a pseudo-2nd order and Langmuir model, yielding a maximum adsorption capacity of 169 mg/g with 96 % removal efficiency, suggesting a monolayer chemisorption process on a relatively heterogeneous surface. The rate constant was determined to be 0.02 g/g-min suggesting a moderate adsorption rate. Thermodynamic analysis indicated adsorption of CR is spontaneous, exothermic, and feasible at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, Fe3O4-CS/Bent exhibits outstanding removal efficiencies in recovery experiments, with 98.6-101.4 % recovery across drinking, tap, canal, and wastewater samples. The adsorbent demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining over 70 % efficiency after 8th regeneration cycle. These findings establish that Fe3O4-CS/Bent nanocomposite is found to be cost-effective environmentally friendly adsorbent for water treatment methods."

      "abstract": "Resource utilization of waste masks is of great significance for environmental protection. In this study, acid-modified waste mask-based activated carbon grafted chitosan composites (CSMA) were prepared using waste masks as a carbon source, chemically modified by introducing sulphonic acid groups through sulfuric acid treatment and further loaded with chitosan, and used for the efficient removal of U(VI) from aqueous solutions. Various characterization techniques, including SEM, FTIR, BET, and XPS, were utilized to investigate the microstructure and surface chemistry of CSMA. The experimental data indicate that optimal adsorption efficiency for CSMA about U(VI) is achieved at a pH of 7, utilizing an adsorbent dosage(m/V) of 0.1 g·L-1, a reaction duration of 6 h, and a temperature of 303 K. Under these conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity reaches 467.93 mg/g. From the kinetic and thermodynamic results of adsorption, it can be seen that the process of CSMA adsorption on uranyl ions was more in line with the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic analysis further confirms that this adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic. In complex aqueous environments containing various co-existing ions, CSMA demonstrates good selective adsorption capabilities. After several testing cycles, CSMA still maintains a high adsorption efficiency for U(VI). Mechanistic studies using XPS/FTIR suggested that U(VI) capture was governed by coordination/chelation with surface functional groups (-NH2, -OH, -SO3H). This study not only presents an innovative approach for resource utilization from discarded masks but also offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for removing radioactive nuclides and facilitating environmental remediation."

      "abstract": "The disposal of recalcitrant dyes in aquatic environments from various industrial sectors is a threat to both the plant and animal kingdom. The presence of dyes in various water bodies undermines the availability of uncontaminated drinking water and may result in serious health-related issues and diseases. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to get rid of these harmful dyes from the aquatic environment. Hence various treatment techniques came to the fore, but they have their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. Several researchers have reported the adsorption of dyes with carbon-based composites, polymeric materials, and metal-based nanoparticles. However, the one with biocompatible materials or biopolymers deserves special attention as they are benign from an environmental viewpoint. We have chosen chitosan as our material of interest and elaborated on the positive aspects of chitosan as an excellent candidate for dye adsorption. Although a plethora of review articles has been disseminated in the past to underscore the utilization of chitosan-based adsorbents in the extraction of dyes, this manuscript endeavors to furnish a thorough examination of the complete adsorption process, encompassing its parameters and kinetics, thus facilitating a reader lacking foundational knowledge in this field to attain a more comprehensible understanding of the subject matter. This review also integrates a comprehensive overview of optimization methodologies for dye adsorption and examines relevant patents-an area that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been thoroughly addressed in previous review articles. Conclusively, it can be stated that chitosan can efficiently adsorb dye from wastewater showing good performance even after five cycles of adsorption/desorption. Moreover, several software programs can be used for optimizing maximum dye adsorption capacity of chitosan which shows well alignment with experimental results, thus making it suitable for real-life applications."

This study aims to develop an effective adsorbent for the removal of Cr(VI) from water. A novel magnetic chitosan-based nanocomposite (Fe₃O₄@MCS) was synthesized by in situ embedding of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles into a chitosan matrix, crosslinked with glutaraldehyde, and further modified with ammonia via a Schiff base reaction. The material was thoroughly characterized using FTIR, XPS, XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, and VSM. Adsorption experiments showed that Fe₃O₄@MCS achieved a maximum Cr(VI) uptake of 221.4 mg/g under optimal conditions (pH 4.0, 25 °C, 10 mg dosage, 120 min contact time), with 100 % removal efficiency at initial concentrations up to 50 ppm within just 15 min. The adsorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 = 0.999), indicating monolayer adsorption behavior. The removal mechanism involves electrostatic interactions between HCrO₄- and protonated amine/hydroxyl groups, followed by Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III), as confirmed by FTIR and XPS analyses. Fe₃O₄@MCS also demonstrated excellent magnetic separability and reusability, maintaining over 90 % removal efficiency after five adsorption-desorption cycles. These findings highlight Fe₃O₄@MCS as a highly promising adsorbent for Cr(VI) remediation in water treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Corneal neovascularization (CRNV) severely impairs corneal transparency and is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide. Drug therapy is the main approach to inhibit CRNV. Insulin (INS) has been reported to facilitate the healing of corneal injuries and suppress inflammation. However, but due to the unique physiological barriers of the eye, its bioavailability is low, limiting its therapeutic effect. In this study, we developed a chitosan-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-INS nanoparticles (CPI NPs) system for INS delivery. The characterization of CPI NPs was satisfactory. Experimental results demonstrated that CPI NPs effectively inhibited the migration of vascular endothelial cells and the formation of tubular structures. Furthermore, CPI NPs markedly suppressed the neovascularization in a CRNV model without any observable side effects. Quantitative proteomics analysis indicated that INS treatment led to a reduction in FTO levels within the neovascularized cornea. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments substantiated the impact of CPI NPs on FTO protein expression and the N6-methyladenosine modification. In conclusion, this study successfully developed an effective ocular drug delivery system for the treatment of CRNV induced by alkali burns, thereby offering a novel therapeutic option for this condition."

Modern insect farming, in contrast, offers advantages such as a circular insect-based economy leading to a reduced carbon footprint. This review explores the potential of insect-derived chitosan as an alternative, emphasizing its environmental benefits during production, functional properties, and potential applications. Several aspects of key analytical techniques for chitin and chitosan characterization, including photometric, chromatographic, and spectroscopic methods, are also discussed.

Their enhanced bioactivity makes them ideal for controlling disease-carrying mollusks, including freshwater snails that transmit Schistosomiasis. This study evaluates the molluscicidal effects of chitosan nanoparticles on Biomphalaria alexandrina snails, including those infected with Schistosoma mansoni, to assess their potential in schistosomiasis control. Chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized by dissolving 0.6% chitosan in 1% acetic acid, adjusting the pH to 4.7, and adding 0.3% TPP under stirring. Sublethal doses (LC10: 49.78 ppm, LC25: 59.02 ppm) were tested on Biomphalaria alexandrina to evaluate toxicity to B. alexandrina snails, effects on laying eggs and their survival rate, hormonal changes, and histological effects in Schistosoma mansoni-infected snails. Flow cytometry assessed Annexin-V levels, survival, infection rate, lifespan, and cercarial production. Sublethal doses (LC10 and LC25) of chitosan nanoparticles significantly reduced snail fecundity and reproductive rates. Hormone levels (progesterone, 17-β estradiol, estrogen, and testosterone) declined notably after treatment. Histological analysis revealed extensive cellular damage, vacuolation, and degeneration, particularly in the head-foot region at 3 and 21 days post-infection with S. mansoni. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased, with a notable rise in late apoptosis and necrosis in infected snails treated with LC25 ppm. Exposure to chitosan nanoparticles also led to reduced Schistosoma mansoni infection rates and cercarial production at 3 and 21 days post-infection with S. mansoni. This study confirms the potent molluscicidal effects of chitosan nanoparticles on Biomphalaria alexandrina, reducing reproduction, hormonal levels, and infection rates while inducing apoptosis and histological damage.

Our goal was to enhance antibacterial drug delivery inside a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm. Our analysis showed a direct correlation between the encapsulation efficacy of HB43 and the physical properties of the CNPs, such as size and zeta potential. P1-CNP was identified as the optimal formulation, characterized by its small size, high encapsulation efficiency, and cationic surface charge. Release studies indicated that HB43 was released in a sustained manner particularly under acidic conditions, which enhanced therapeutic efficacy. We tested the P1-CNP in culture media with pH levels of 7.4 and 5.5 to assess the pH responsiveness of the CNPs and mimic the infection environment. Both conditions showed that the HB43 loaded-CNPs effectively reduced bacterial populations in a dose-dependent manner, with up to a 99.99 % reduction in bacterial load. This study offers a promising new strategy for managing biofilm-associated infections and addressing antibiotic resistance by using CNPs loaded with HB43."

These lecithin and chitosan-based NPs loaded with melatonin (NP-MEL) were evaluated for their cytotoxic potential in metastatic breast cancer cells and their safety profile in a murine model. Physicochemical characterization revealed efficient melatonin encapsulation (31 %), a positive zeta potential (48.6 mV), and controlled release at physiological pH. NP-MEL exhibited selective cytotoxicity in vitro, with a toxic concentration capable of killing 50 % of the cells (CC50) of 109.53 μg/mL for 4 T1 cancer cells and a significantly higher CC50 of 1460.59 μg/mL for normal VERO cells, resulting in a selectivity index of 13.33. In vivo experiments with BALB/c mice with tumor implantation treated with NP-MEL (2 mg/kg/day for 21 days) showed no significant changes in weight, clinical signs, or biochemical markers of liver and kidney function, except for changes in gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. Histopathological analyses confirmed the preservation of the liver and kidney architecture in the NP-MEL-treated group, in contrast to the moderate-to-severe kidney damage observed in animals treated with empty NPs. These findings highlight the low toxicity and therapeutic potential of NP-MEL as a controlled and targeted-release system for breast cancer treatment, indicating the need for further preclinical investigation."

RESULTS: We identified four key CRGs (Atp7a, Cp, Loxl2, and Pde3b) and three key transcription factors (C/EBPα, Stat6, and Runx1) that were upregulated post-SCI, promoting cuproptosis and neuroinflammation. NT3-loaded chitosan treatment significantly inhibited CRG expression and enhanced functional recovery in the animal models. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated binding interactions between chitosan and key CRGs, suggesting a potential mechanism for their therapeutic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the critical role of CRGs in SCI progression and the potential of NT3-loaded chitosan as a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting cuproptosis and promoting functional recovery. Future studies should focus on validating these findings in larger cohorts and exploring the detailed mechanisms by which NT3-loaded chitosan modulates CRG expression."

      "abstract": "The clinical management and treatment of skin wounds in the elderly present significant challenges due to changes in skin structure and function. This study introduces a novel injectable self-healing hydrogel composed of quaternized chitosan and carboxymethyl chitosan (HACC/CMCS, HC), designed through electrostatic interactions. Its excellent injectability and self-healing properties enhance the application of hydrogel dressings and prolong their functional lifespan. Moreover, the adhesion and flexibility of HC hydrogel contribute to their stability in highly dynamic regions, thereby preventing detachment and enhancing their hemostatic function. The material exhibits excellent biocompatibility and possesses antibacterial properties that protect wounds from external microbial damage, thereby reducing the risk of infection while maintaining a moist environment that facilitates healing. Importantly, the in vivo test have demonstrated that the HC hydrogel significantly enhances collagen deposition, reduces senescent cell accumulation, and accelerates wound closure. Therefore, this study offers a safe, effective, and cost-efficient solution for managing wounds in the aging population."

By utilizing a busulfan-treated mouse model and integrated multi-omics analysis, this study explored the potential mechanisms through which chitosan improves impaired spermatogenesis. The results showed that chitosan treatment can improve testicular function and significantly reshape the gut microbiota composition in busulfan-treated mice. Metabolomics revealed that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) transport was significantly dysregulated in busulfan-treated mice, but chitosan reversed this dysfunction by modulating tight junction proteins and fatty acid transporters in the intestine. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments further highlighted the critical role of gut microbiota in DHA transport and spermatogenesis. Additionally, DHA supplementation alleviated busulfan-induced ferroptosis in testicular tissues. Hence, owing to its prebiotic effects chitosan could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for improving busulfan-induced spermatogenic disorders by restoring the homeostasis of the gut-testis axis.",

Sesamol was added to meatballs at either 0 mg/kg (control) or 30 mg/kg meat by three methods, i.e., (i) mixing sesamol into the meat mince without coating (SE), (ii) mixing sesamol into meat mince and followed by coating of the meatballs with 1 % CSNP-MC (SE-CT), and (iii) dissolving sesamol in CSNP-MC and the meatballs were coated with the mixture (SE-M-CT). Due to the barrier properties of the edible coating, meatballs from the SE-CT and SE-M-CT groups had lower levels of moisture loss, oil uptake and lipid oxidation compared to the control (no sesamol and no coating) and SE groups (P < 0.05). In addition, the SE-CT treatment resulted in lower protein oxidation and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) level, leading to reduced PAH4 levels and toxic equivalent quotient (TEQBaP) in the meatballs compared to the SE-M-CT treatment. These findings suggested that the incorporation of antioxidant of sesamol within the meat mince combined with edible coatings is an effective strategy to enhance the quality and safety of deep-fried meatballs by reducing oil uptake, and decreasing lipid and protein oxidation, PAH levels and the carcinogenic risk of PAHs by meatball consumption.",

      "abstract": "Outbreaks of Listeria monocytogenes associated with ready-to-eat (RTE) sausages have occurred worldwide for many years. Their causes have been mainly due to post-processing contamination. Consequently, the current study developed an antimicrobial sausage casing to protect RTE sausages from recontamination after heat treatment throughout storage. The cellulose casing was impregnated with chitosan, a natural antimicrobial substance. The proper conditions of the vacuum impregnation technique to produce the antimicrobial-impregnated casing were 2 % v/v of chitosan solution, vacuum pressure at 74.66 kPa for 120 s, and a relaxation time of 30 s. When examined in broth media, the antimicrobial-impregnated casing obtained from these conditions decreased L. monocytogenes Scott A by 1.50 log CFU/g (∼96.8 %) within 24 h. The quantitative amount of chitosan released from the impregnated cellulose casing was 0.1180 % w/v, as determined using the ninhydrin test. The penetration of chitosan into the cellulose casing was evaluated using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy to monitor the distribution and intensity of chitosan's amino group (-NH2), nitrogen-containing groups (N), and the saccharide structure. The contour mapping of the impregnated casing presented the highest distribution of the chitosan functional groups in all casing areas that was determined based on the specific functional groups of chitosan (NH, CH) at 1406-1353 cm-1, as well as other dominant changes, including the wavelength ranges 1183-1140 cm-1 (CO stretching), 3658-3027 cm-1 (OH, NH, CH), 2997-2828 cm-1 (NH stretching, CH stretching, CH3 symmetric stretching, CH ring) and 1139-1009 cm-1 (CO stretching), respectively. In addition, application of the impregnated casing for sausage emulsion was evaluated. Under vacuum-packed conditions, the antimicrobial-impregnated casing retarded L. monocytogenes Scott A growth in the inoculated Vienna sausage at 4 and 10 °C throughout the storage for 28 and 5 days, respectively. In un-inoculated sausage, the antimicrobial-impregnated casing extended the shelf-life of fresh sausage at 4 and 10 °C for 63 and 14 days, respectively. It was concluded that cellulose casing impregnated with chitosan was suitable for use as an antimicrobial-impregnated casing to protect post-processing contamination on the food surface, to maintain wholesomeness of the product, and to extend the shelf-life of RTE sausage.",

The results indicated that PBS significantly lowered the organ index and inflammatory factor levels while increasing the levels of oxidase in mice. Interestingly, after PBS intervention, the mRNA expression levels of mucin, tight junction proteins, immune proteins, and transcription factors that constitute the intestinal barrier in mice exhibited a significant increase compared to those in the model group. The intestinal flora results showed that PBS improved the abundance of Ruminococcus, Bacillus, and Roseburia, simultaneously increasing the content of short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, the downstream protein expression of pathway genes confirmed that PBS inhibited the inflammatory response by regulating the TLR4-NF-κB-NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. These results indicate that carrier protection for Bacillus subtilis can enhance its relief effect on mice infected with Salmonella."

      "abstract": "Recently, chitosan derivatives, as eco-sustainable and renewable products, have been recorded to be highly effective toward cosmetics with potent biological activity. The main core of this research is to develop an organic hair conditioner (OHC) based on two chitosan-thiadiazole conjugates, chitosan-(ethylthio‑thiadiazole) (CH-ETD) and chitosan-(benzylthio‑thiadiazole) (CH-BTD), with natural fragrances. A series of nine OHC formulae were prepared (CH1-CH3 for chitosan based OHC, E1-E3 for CH-ETD based OHC, and B1-B3 for CH-BTD based OHC) and characterized based on their visual examination, pH, thermal stability, dirt dispersion, moisturizing time, percentage of solid content, hair irritation, rinsing, combing, and the luster. The results showed that the pH values of all OHC formulae were 4.2-4.7 which is considered acceptable to avoid skin irritation. A distinctive film surrounds each individual hair shaft in the CH-ETD and CH-BTD treated groups when compared to control hair without the application of hair conditioner under a scanning electron microscope SEM with a magnification power of 100 μm. Additionally, every single hair shaft is clearly covered, and the control group exhibited noticeable hair issues that were not observed in the treated groups, which showed no signs of tangling. Due to the end-use performance properties of the formulated hair conditioner products, it can be concluded that the formulas of (CH, E2, and B2) were the best efficacy; hair easier to style, detangle the hair, retain moisture, not be very thick, not cause irritation or inflammation, minimize frizz, and create a protective barrier on the hair. These findings collectively validate the potential of CH-ETD and CH-BTD based formulations coupled with natural perfumery as a transformative approach to hair care, aligning with consumer preferences for both efficacy and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, in this work, docking studies have been conducted to provide theoretical proof about the significant roles of chitosan and keratin in hair growth and cosmetic applications (skin)."

Based on transcriptomic analysis, CTS-Ca treatment down-regulated the expression of genes on the chorismate/tyrosine pathway to inhibit the synthesis of phenolic substrates and tyrosinase activity, up-regulated the three energy metabolism pathways of glycolysis, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane, increased the expression of catalase and superoxide dismutase genes to scavenge ROS.

As confirmed by morphological analysis, the BSANPs were synthesized using desolvation techniques, resulting in spherical and smooth nanoparticles. Both RES-BSANPs and CS-RES-BSANPs exhibited stability for 90 days at ambient refrigerated temperatures. Through optimization using a Box-Behnken design, RES-BSANPs with favorable colloidal properties were achieved. Differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction confirmed the amorphous dispersion of RES within the nanocarriers. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated a biphasic release pattern aligned with the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, exhibiting both burst and sustained release phases. Stability tests indicated that RES-BSA-NPs and CS-RES-NPs remain stable at 4 °C. Ex vivo studies verified the safety of RES-loaded nanoparticles, and behavioral tests on the Wistar rat model showed that intranasally administered CS-RES-BSANPs were more effective than plain RES dispersion. These results emphasize the potential of biodegradable and mucoadhesive CS-RES-BSANPs as effective drug carriers for intranasal delivery to the brain, offering safety and high tolerability for Alzheimer's disease treatment."

Metabolites produced are the biochemical indicators of any type of stressed imposed on plant system. In the present study the ameliorative effect of seed priming and foliar application of 0.25 % chitosan was evaluated on red kidney bean variety grown under induced drought stress. Seed bio-priming resulted in increase in total reducing sugar and free amino acid (23.88 ± 0.21 and 8.18 ± 0.02 mg/g DW contents, respectively). The higher value of IC50 for α-amylase (67.40 ± 0.01 mg/ml) and α-glucosidase (30.92 ± 0.01 mg/ml) inhibition activity was observed in the seeds obtained from the treatment SP20. Proanthocyanidin in seeds was observed in the range of 0.71-1.53 mg/g DW across treatments. Chitosan-treated plants exhibited increased chlorophyll, proline with enhanced activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, Proline dehydrogenase and Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase and reduced malondialdehyde content. The LC-MS analysis revealed 15 sugars and 21 amino acids in the seed samples. This study highlights the potential of chitosan bio-priming in imparting drought tolerance. It also aligns with sustainable development goals and offers a sustainable approach to improving red kidney bean productivity and nutritional quality under water-limited conditions."

The contact angle analysis showed that oxygen plasma is more efficient in modifying the composite material. FTIR analysis confirmed the incorporation of OH functional groups in plasma treated samples with a broad peak around 3260 cm-1. Surface morphological analysis shows a rougher texture with visible voids on the plasma-treated films. Roughness values of the plasma treated CZ1, CZ2 and CZ3 were 73.50, 73.34, and 79.97 nm. OES spectrum is recorded, the species present are of pure oxygen and the electron temperature was calculated as 1.82 eV from the line-intensity ratio method. In the removal studies of Cu (II) ions, plasma-treated CZ1 showed an adsorption capacity of 195.14 mg/g, a higher value than the other samples. Pseudo-second-order kinetics provided a good fit for the experimental data. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms provide a good fit suggesting that the adsorption is not restricted to monolayer. Thermodynamic studies show that the adsorption is spontaneous and exothermic in low temperatures. The produced surface-modified CZ promises an effective removal of heavy metals which would encourage the use of natural and sustainable materials for wastewater treatment."

To treat periodontitis, this study combined the advantages of nanoparticles and hydrogels, and successfully developed an injectable aldehyde-functionalized PF127, carboxymethyl and sulfonated chitosan hydrogel doped with copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS/PCS). The CuS/PCS hydrogel was synthesized through a dynamic Schiff base reaction. The injectable hydrogel forms a gel in situ after injection into deep periodontal pockets, achieving high antibacterial activity without causing bacterial resistance. The CuS/PCS hydrogel exhibited good biocompatibility, maintained cell viability, promoted stem cell proliferation, and demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity. In the rat periodontitis model, the CuS/PCS hydrogel effectively reduced inflammation and bone loss, and promoted periodontal tissue regeneration. These results suggest that CuS/PCS hydrogel could be a promising biomaterial for the treatment of periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Chitosan has emerged as a promising biopolymer for developing eco-friendly adsorbents for wastewater treatment contaminated by different compounds, such as heavy metals, pharmaceutical compounds, pesticides, and synthetic dyes. Despite its biocompatibility and biodegradability, the application of pristine chitosan in adsorption systems is limited by its low surface area, poor thermal and mechanical stability, and high solubility under acidic conditions. This comprehensive review analyzes recent advances in chitosan's chemical and physical modification to enhance its physicochemical, morphological, and adsorption performance. The role of crosslinking agents, nanocomposite synthesis, and the incorporation of magnetic particles in improving the material's textural characteristics, selectivity, and regeneration potential was highlighted. The novelty of this work lies in its evaluation of how these structural modifications can influence the adsorption mechanisms and performance in different classes of contaminants under varying experimental conditions. Furthermore, this review highlighted the importance of structural-functional correlations, including surface area, pore distribution, crystallinity, and thermal stability, in optimizing adsorbents' adsorption capacity and reusability. The study also provides critical insights into the effects of pH, temperature, ionic strength, and competitive adsorption in multicomponent systems, furnishing valuable details about the design of high-performance and sustainable chitosan-based adsorbents."

      "abstract": "Squid pen (SP) was found to contain 64.41% protein and 26.03% chitin. The amino acid composition revealed that Met was the most abundant amino acid in SP, with a concentration of 13.67 g/100 g. To enhance the stability and bioavailability of SP hydrolysates, microcapsules were developed using ultrasonic emulsification techniques with SP trypsin hydrolysates (SPTH) and SP β-chitosan (SPC). The optimal preparation conditions involved using a 2% concentration of SPC, a 4 mg/mL concentration of SPTH, a core-to-wall ratio (v/v) of 1:3 for SPTH/SPC, and subjecting them to ultrasonic treatment for 20 min. These microcapsules had a loading capacity of 58.95% for SPTH under these conditions. The successful encapsulation of SPTH in the SPC complex to form SPC-SPTH microcapsules was confirmed by FTIR, XRD, DSC, and SEM, exhibiting good thermal stability, small particle size, and high encapsulation efficiency. In vitro digestion studies demonstrated a release of 15.61% in simulated gastric fluid and 69.32% in intestinal fluid, achieving targeted release in the intestines. The digested products exhibited superior antioxidant activity compared to free SPTH digests, suggesting that microencapsulation effectively preserves SPTH bioactivity. This study enhances the bioavailability of SPTH and offers a promising delivery system for natural compounds with low bioavailability and stability.",

This study used the 2bRAD-M method to analyze the effects of dietary chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) supplementation on the gut microbiota of P. vannamei. Shrimp were fed diets with COS at 5‰ and 10‰ levels. Results showed that as COS concentration increased, beneficial microbial taxa (e.g., Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Campylobacter) significantly increased, while harmful bacteria decreased. For example, Vibrio parahemolyticus abundance dropped from 0.084 in controls to 0.033 in the 5‰ group, and Vibrio rotiforianus decreased from 0.216 in controls to 0.121 and 0.021 in the 5‰ and 10‰ groups, respectively. Photobacterium damselae also declined from 0.244 in controls to 0.049 and 0.094 in the 5‰ and 10‰ groups. These findings indicate that COS supplementation can enhance beneficial microbes and reduce harmful bacteria in P. vannamei intestines. This study highlights COS as a sustainable dietary intervention to improve shrimp health and reduce antibiotic use in aquaculture. IMPORTANCE: This study demonstrates that dietary chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) supplementation can effectively modulate the intestinal microbiota of Penaeus vannamei. At 5‰ and 10‰ levels, COS increased beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria) while reducing harmful pathogens like Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio rotiferianus. This shift enhances nutrient absorption, immune function, and disease resistance in shrimp. COS thus offers a sustainable alternative to antibiotics in aquaculture, promoting healthy growth and reducing environmental impact."

The optimum formulation was characterized for encapsulation efficiency, particle size (PS), zeta potential (ZP), drug release, stability, TEM, FTIR, DSC and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. RESULTS: The optimum formulation (ME4/TPP0.25) demonstrated spherical particles with a PS of 1.56 ± 0.04 µm, a PDI value of 0.29 ± 0.05, ZP of +35.26 ± 0.9 mV, and EE% of 94.7 ± 0.24% and loading capacity of 11.7 ± 0.16% (w/w). In vivo studies demonstrated that ME4/TPP0.25 significantly suppressed knee joint swelling, and significantly reduced the levels of catabolic and inflammatory mediators (ALP and IL-6) compared to drug alone.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cadmium is a highly toxicant heavy metal that poses serious risks to aquatic organisms, animals, and humans. Recent studies have investigated using biological chitosan nanoparticles (Bio-CHNPs) as a potential solution to alleviate the harmful effects of Cd exposure, particularly in aquaculture. Bio-CHNPs have gained attention for their applications in drug delivery and biomedical research, indicating their potential utility in addressing environmental toxicity. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to explore the effectiveness of Bio-CHNPs in mitigating cadmium chloride (CdCL2) toxicity in African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). METHODS: One hundred and twenty (n = 120) catfish were divided into 4 groups; G1 (control); G2, intoxicated with 10% LC50 of CdCL2; G3 received 3 g/kg of Bio-CNPs; G4, treated with 10% LC50 of CdCL2 and Bio-CNPs 3 g/kg feed. RESULTS: CdCl2 exposure resulted in severe liver, intestine, and kidney damage, which was evidenced by alterations in biochemical parameters, hormonal imbalance, DNA damage, and micronucleus formation. Antioxidant defense mechanisms were compromised, as the activities of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC), and Catalase (CAT) were reduced. mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-8, and LBP were also significantly elevated following CdCl2 exposure. Conversely, Bio-CHNPs treatment showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, greatly lowering the biochemical, genotoxic, and histopathological effects induced by CdCl2. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study are indicative of the potential of Bio-CHNPs as a promising aquaculture feed supplement, with a dual advantage of antagonizing the toxicity of environmental pollutants like Cd and imparting antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. Bio-CHNP supplementation can be a viable strategy for remedying aquatic environmental heavy metal pollution, with the ultimate safeguarding of human health and ecosystem balance.",

      "abstract": "This work developed a Schiff base-chitosan-vanillin/hydroxyapatite (CHI-VAN/HA) composite from natural resources for effective brilliant green (BG) dye removal from aquatic systems. Physicochemical analysis of CHI-VAN/HA was performed via several methods, including BET, XRD, FTIR, and SEM-EDX. The mean pore diameter and total pore volume of CHI-VAN/HA were found to be 4.31 nm and 0.01994 cm3/g, respectively, while the BET surface area was found to be 18.49 m2/g. The CHI-VAN/HA composite mostly exhibits polycrystalline properties, as shown by its average crystallite size of 12.67 nm. Box-Behnken design (BBD) in response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the impacts of the adsorption process parameters, namely the CHI-VAN/HA dosage (A: 0.02-0.08 g/L), pH (B: 4-10), and contact duration (C: 10-40 min). The adsorption process was described using the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-first-order kinetic models. The thermodynamic analysis confirms that the adsorption process is both spontaneous (Gibbs free energy change, ΔG° = -6.832, -7.368, -7.904, and - 8.440 kJ/mol at 298, 308, 318, and 328 K respectively) and endothermic (enthalpy change, ΔH° = 9.156 kJ/mol), with increased interfacial disorder (entropy change, ΔS° = 0.0536 kJ/molK) facilitating the favorable uptake of BG dye onto the CHI-VAN/HA composite. The cost analysis for preparing 1 kg of CHI-VAN/HA adsorbent is approximately $215/kg. The CHI-VAN/HA composite exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 295.74 mg/g for BG dye. Several interactions, including electrostatic, π-π, n-π, H-bonding, and Lewis acid-base interaction, were identified as the mechanism for the BG dye adsorption. This work highlights that the developed Schiff base-chitosan-vanillin/hydroxyapatite composite, derived from natural sources, offers an eco-friendly and sustainable solution for brilliant green dye removal. Its excellent adsorption performance and physicochemical properties underscore its potential application in wastewater treatment and environmental remediation."

Wistar rats were used as subjects, with 51 rats divided into three groups. Each group received a different treatment: application of the collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane, pericardial membrane, or cross-linked pericardial membrane, administered subcutaneously. On days 0, 7, 14, and 30, the rats were terminated, and the membranes and surrounding tissues were collected for analysis. A histological examination was performed to evaluate the membrane biodegradation rate, the number of blood vessels formed, and the inflammatory response.The data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests, with a p-value of < 0.05 considered statistically significant.The collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane remained in the tissue up to day 30, while the pericardial membrane and cross-linked pericardial membrane were completely degraded by day 7. The average number of new blood vessels formed in the collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane on days 7, 14, and 30 was greater than that in the pericardial membrane and cross-linked pericardial membrane, which was statistically significant (p < 0.005). The average number of inflammatory cells in the collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane on day 30 was lower than that in the pericardial membrane and cross-linked pericardial membrane, which was statistically significant (p < 0.005) for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) for eosinophils and mast cells.Biodegradation, angiogenesis, and the inflammatory response in collagen-chitosan-PVA membranes showed better results compared with other membranes. Collagen-chitosan-PVA membranes exhibit potential for application in guided tissue regeneration treatment for periodontal disease."

The quality was evaluated on the basis of physical and barrier properties, as well as lipid oxidation for coated and uncoated chicken meat. Chicken breast meat was cut into small pieces, pasteurized, and coated with the active film solution. The active gelatin-chitosan film enriched was prepared with different concentrations of rosemary extract (0 to 2%). The application of the coating solution, with or without ultrasonic treatment was conducted. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to freeze drying for 72 h. The water activity, color, hygroscopic, and rehydration properties of the freeze-dried coated meat were measured. Moreover, the lipid oxidation of the coated vs. uncoated meat was also investigated during a 6 month storage period. Results showed that the coating can form a non-porous surface, which resists the exchange of water vapor, thereby decreasing hygroscopicity and rehydration rates. Likewise, the reduction in the color change and the level of malondialdehyde proved that the active coating allowed good preservation of the meat samples against lipid oxidation during the storage period. However, the application of coating with the use of ultrasound treatment did not positively affect lipid oxidation reduction, and an even higher value was observed in comparison to samples immersed in film forming solutions without ultrasound treatment. It can be concluded that the phenolic compounds incorporated into the film matrix had antioxidant activity, minimizing the extent of lipid oxidation in foods."

This bibliometric study investigates and analyzes 1690 documents retrieved from the Web of Science published between 2014 and 2024, focusing on chitosan-mineral composites for wastewater treatment. We used Bibliometrix (R package), HistCite, and VOSviewer tools to examine publication trends, authorship, collaborations between countries, and networks of keywords. Key parameters included an important annual growth rate of 16.86%, 32.12 average citations per document, and contributions from 480 sources. The field has grown exponentially since 2018, with China, India, and Iran leading the research output. High citation rates (avg. 32.12 per document) reflect a strong academic impact, while 26.78% international collaboration underscores global engagement. As such, the analysis of keywords present in these papers found predominant themes that have driven research, namely adsorption mechanisms and composite functionalization (i.e., magnetic hybrids). Novel trends involve clay-chitosan synergies and nano-reinforced composites for pollutant-specific removal."

      "abstract": "Diabetic wounds are difficult to heal because of persistent oxidative stress and limited angiogenesis. However, traditional wound dressings cannot address these issues simultaneously. In this study, a thermosensitive chitosan (CS) hydrogel loaded with Thonningianin A (TA) nanoparticles (TA-NPs) was constructed. First, TA-NPs were developed via the nanoprecipitation technique. CS was subsequently combined with β‑sodium glycerophosphate (β-GP) to prepare a thermosensitive hydrogel matrix (CS/β-GP). Finally, composite hydrogels (TA-NPs@Gel) with antioxidant and angiogenesis-promoting properties were synthesized by incorporating TA-NPs into a CS/β-GP hydrogel matrix. Characterization revealed that the TA-NPs were uniformly spherical, with a particle size of 186.30 ± 1.15 nm and a zeta potential of -35.07 ± 0.61 mV. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the successful integration of TA-NPs into the hydrogel matrix. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that TA-NPs@Gel exhibited potent antioxidant and angiogenic effects, significantly accelerating wound healing in a diabetic mouse model. Network pharmacology predictions indicated that TA-NPs@Gel promoted diabetic wound healing through the HIF-1 signaling pathway. Overall, the integration of TA-NPs into a hydrogel system has broad therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetic wounds."

The resulting hydrogels were then immersed in zinc chloride solutions at different concentrations to further improve their properties. Structural analysis revealed the formation of stable imine bonds between the amino and aldehyde groups, alongside the coordination of the carboxyl group with zinc ions. Scanning electron microscopy, texture profile analysis, and rheological tests revealed that the introduction of AgNPs contributed to a denser hydrogel network and increased hardness. Moreover, the incorporation of zinc ions significantly enhanced the mechanical properties, resulting in a 7.44-fold increase in the hydrogel's hardness relative to its original form. The hydrogel's antibacterial performance was evaluated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, showing notable inhibitory effects. The inhibition zone diameters for both bacterial strains exhibited an approximate 2.5-fold increase, indicating enhanced antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the adsorption capacity of the CEC/OSA/Ag1/Zn3 hydrogels for dyes was examined, with methylene blue and Congo red uptakes recorded at 157.23 mg/g and 79.15 mg/g, respectively. This study offers a promising and sustainable approach to tackle the challenges of dye wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "There is an increasing demand to not only accelerate the development of advanced therapy tissue engineered medicines, but to also eliminate xenogeneic materials from their development cycle. With these in mind, herein we first assessed the influence of carrageenan as macromolecular crowding agent to enhance and accelerate extracellular matrix deposition in xeno-free human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cell cultures and we developed and characterised a non-animal sourced chitosan scaffold. Following appropriate in vitro experimentation, a splinted nude mouse wound healing model was used to assess wound closure and scar size of non-treated control, non-animal sourced chitosan scaffold, non-animal sourced chitosan scaffold loaded with xeno-free human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells and non-animal sourced chitosan scaffold loaded with xeno-free human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells cultured under macromolecular crowding conditions groups. Across all three donors, carrageenan supplementation significantly increased collagen deposition at day 5, day 8 and day 11 without affecting cell morphology, viability, DNA concentration and metabolic activity. Through freeze drying, a non-animal sourced chitosan sponge was developed with appropriate structural and mechanical properties for wound healing applications. In vitro biological analysis made apparent that neither the scaffold nor macromolecular crowding negatively impacted xeno-free human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cell metabolic activity and proliferation. In vivo biological analysis revealed no significant differences between the groups in wound closure and scar size, raising question about the suitability of the model. In any case, this work sets the foundations for the development of completely xeno-free tissue engineered medicines."

      "abstract": "In order to extend the shelf life of fruits, edible coatings have been widely studied as a potential alternative strategy to traditional preservatives. This study developed a novel chitosan (CH)/pullulan (PUL) composite edible coating incorporated with 2 % thyme essential oil nanoemulsion (TEON) to enhance antifungal and preservative properties, which consisted of five CH/PUL edible coating groups: C100, C100/T, C75/P25/T, C50/P50/T and C25/P75/T. TEON was characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), revealing an average particle size of 89.56 nm. In vitro antifungal test demonstrated that the CH coating with TEON reduced Botrytis cinerea mycelial area from 14.03 mm2 to 6.35 mm2 compared to C100 coatings, achieving a 54.7 % inhibition rate. The microstructure, mechanical properties, antifungal properties, and the effect of CH/PUL edible coating on the preservation of strawberry were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed intermolecular interactions between CH and PUL. The addition of PUL increased the water permeability of CH-based films from 0.69 m2‧h‧kpa to 0.13 m2‧h‧kpa and the tensile properties from 45 % to 88 %. Strawberry preservation at 2 °C for 12 days showed C50/P50/T-treated samples had the lowest weight loss, decay incidence, and Botrytis cinerea area, compared with the other treatment groups. In summary, this paper successfully developed CH/PUL edible coating with antifungal and preservation effects, which have potential applications in improving strawberry quality and extending the storage period of strawberries."

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes the third highest mortality worldwide. Liver ablation, surgery, and embolization are conventional methods for treatment. However, these methods have limitations. To overcome these issues, nanomedicines have potential due to their high stability, high drug load capacity, and controlled release. Thus, we prepared quercetin-loaded polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with folic acid-chitosan (QPCF-NPs) to improve drug delivery and targetability applications of quercetin for the treatment of HCC. We prepared QPCF-NPs by solvent evaporation and coated them with chitosan-folic acid (CS-FA). QPCF-NPs were examined using Fourier-Transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the drug release rate and cytotoxicity were studied. Moreover, in vivo HCC studies such as histopathology and biochemical parameters were conducted. Subsequently, QPCF-NPs with a spherical shape and an average size of 200-290 nm have been demonstrated to have formed by FTIR, XRD, SEM, and TEM. Further, we observed sustained drug release from QPCF-NPs compared to quercetin. Cellular cytotoxicity showed significant inhibition in the HEPG2-cell line with QPCF-NPs treatment. Biochemical estimate and oxidative stress regulation were considerably more regulated in the treatment groups than the HCC group in a dose-dependent way after subcutaneous administration of QPCF-NPs. ELISA of interleukin and caspase-3 demonstrated the anticipated results in comparison to the carcinogen control group. Compared to earlier preparations, the QPCF-NPs generated demonstrated better drug targetability and potency for treating HCC."

      "abstract": "Currently, as research on hydrogel beads intensifies, the application scope of chitosan-based hydrogel beads is increasingly expanding. Owing to their unique three-dimensional network structure, chitosan-based hydrogel beads are frequently utilized for encapsulating bioactive substances and adsorbing impurities. The primary material used in the preparation of chitosan-based hydrogel beads is chitosan, which is uniquely a natural polysaccharide possessing a positive charge. Derived from a diverse array of sources, chitosan is non-toxic, exhibits excellent biocompatibility, and possesses certain antibacterial properties. Because of these remarkable attributes, it has found widespread application in tissue engineering, the formulation of drug carriers, and the adsorption of heavy metals and dyes in wastewater. The preparation method for chitosan-based hydrogel beads largely mirrors that of other hydrogel beads. According to existing research, numerous methods exist for crafting hydrogel beads with diverse properties. This paper reviews the preparation methods of chitosan-based hydrogel beads, encompassing both physical and chemical crosslinking techniques. The physical crosslinking method leverages electrostatic interactions between materials to form hydrogel beads, whereas the chemical crosslinking method involves the use of chemical crosslinking agents to facilitate the formation of hydrogel beads through material-based chemical reactions. Given that chitosan carries a positive charge and other polysaccharide materials possess a negative charge, the combination of these materials can yield hydrogel beads with a dense structure, effectively encapsulating bioactive substances. This dense internal structure offers superior protection for the encapsulated bioactive substances. Chitosan-based hydrogel beads typically feature large pore sizes, providing numerous adsorption sites, which makes them well suited for wastewater treatment. Additionally, this paper examines the recent applications of chitosan-based hydrogel beads in food preservation, medicine, and environmental protection. Starting with the materials and methods for preparing chitosan-based hydrogel beads, this paper delves into their applications in food preservation, biomedicine, and environmental protection, offering insights for future developments and applications of chitosan-based hydrogel beads and fostering further innovation and advancement in this field."

Traditional burn dressings often fail to deliver the anticipated therapeutic benefits. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an ideal wound dressing that exhibits satisfactory antibacterial properties, biocompatibility, and the ability to expedite burn wound healing. Here, we prepared chitosan-based hydrogel (CS/GP), and then loaded copper-tin -sulfur (Cu3SnS4) synthesized by hydrothermal method into the hydrogel to construct a new hydrogel dressing (CS/GP/Cu3SnS4). In vitro antibacterial tests demonstrated that the CS/GP/Cu3SnS4 hydrogel dressing exhibits considerable antibacterial properties, achieving an antibacterial rate exceeding 95% after 4 h of contact with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Additionally, CCK-8 and live/dead cell staining experiments confirmed the dressing's good biocompatibility. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that the CS/GP/Cu3SnS4 hydrogel dressing demonstrates superior wound healing performance compared to the control group. In conclusion, the CS/GP/Cu3SnS4 hydrogel shows potential application prospects as a burn wound dressing.",

      "abstract": "Chitosan (CS), a versatile and alkaline polysaccharide, has gained significant attention in nanomedicine due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. In recent years, its applications in cancer therapy, particularly for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, diagnostic agents, and genes, have advanced considerably. However, many CS-based nanomedicines suffer from poor stability in biological fluids, especially under physiological conditions. The neutral pH and the presence of electrolytes in physiological environments reduce the charge density of CS, which can account for this application limitation of CS-based nanomedicines. To improve the stability and prevent dissociation or aggregation of these nanomedicines before reaching the target sites, this review summarizes common stabilization strategies including hydrophilic or hydrophobic modification of CS, as well as incorporation with metal ions (e.g. Fe3+ or Zn2+), complexation with anionic cross-linkers (e.g. TPP) or anionic polymers. Additionally, the review highlights the application of stabilized CS-based nanocarriers in drug delivery, with a particular focus on cancer therapy. The challenges and future perspectives for accelerating the clinical translation of these nanomedicines are also discussed."

      "abstract": "The physical and chemical properties of gold nanoparticles can significantly influence their anti-tumor efficacy. Streamlining synthesis methods to modulate these properties and enhance therapeutic effects could facilitate their translation into clinical applications. This study presents a new approach to synthesize small alkynyl-modified gold nanoparticles (Alk-GNP) at room temperature using sodium citrate and propiolic acid (PA) to reduce chloroauric acid. The resulting Alk-GNP, approximately 11 nm in size with narrow dispersion, contrasts with larger gold nanoparticles (GNP) synthesized by the classical Turkevich method using boiling water. Subsequently, a round composite (CHAM) was developed using chitosan and hyaluronic acid to co-deliver Alk-GNP and the photosensitizer methylene blue for synergistic treatment. CHAM showed excellent stability and strong CD44-positive tumor targeting capabilities. It significantly boosted photothermal activity and reactive oxygen species generation compared to current GNP-based formulations. In tumor-bearing mouse models, CHAM effectively localized in tumor tissue and exhibited potent photothermal and photodynamic therapeutic effects to inhibit tumor growth while ensuring safety. The robust data presented in this study supports the potential translation of this approach, offering a simplified preparation process and improved tumor treatment efficacy."

Two different volumes of CBWE (4 mL and 8 mL) were incorporated to form CMC/Cs/CBWE4 and CMC/Cs/CBWE8, which was compared with a spongy material that prepared without extract (CMC/Cs/CBWE0). The bioactive compounds in CBWE were analyzed via GC-MS, identifying many compounds, including oleic acid (30.07 %) and n-hexadecanoic acid (23.96 %). Antioxidant activity was assessed via the DPPH assay, which showed a maximum scavenging activity of 96.0 % at 1000 μg/mL of CBWE, with an IC50 value of 17.29 μg/mL. In antibacterial testing, CBWE demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition against waterborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, with a zone of inhibition of 28.0 mm at 100 μg/mL. The CMC/Cs/CBWE8 spongy material achieved 100 % degradation of brilliant green (BG) dye at 30 ppm catalyst dosage within 120 min, significantly outperforming the control spongy material (CMC/Cs/CBWE0), which only achieved 59 % degradation under the same conditions. Reusability tests demonstrated that CMC/Cs/CBWE8 retained 86 % of its original catalytic efficiency after five cycles, highlighting its durability. The incorporation of CBWE into CMC/Cs based spongy materials significantly enhanced their catalytic of toxic dyes and antimicrobial properties, making them highly effective for wastewater treatment applications."

But the poor water resistance significantly limits the application scenarios for paper-based packaging. This study was designed to improve the hydrophobic properties of paper-based antimicrobial indicator cards by surface coating with methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The results indicated that all treated antimicrobial indicator cards changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, with the MTS/OTS (1:1) treated antimicrobial indicator cards (M/OTS@Paper) showing the highest hydrophobicity (119.38°) and strong hydrophobic stability. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis indicated that the increase in hydrophobicity was attributable to the decrease in hydrogen bonding within the hydroxyl groups. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results substantiated that the hydroxyl groups present in the paper and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) reacted with the hydrophobicizing agent, which was consistent with the phenomenon observed in scanning electron microscope (SEM). The hydrophobically treated antimicrobial indicator cards showed varying degrees of mechanical degradation due to hydrogen bond disruption. Antimicrobial indicator cards still retain excellent antimicrobial activity, pH response, and ammonia sensitivity after hydrophobic treatment. When using the antimicrobial indicator cards to monitor carp freshness, the cards' color changed significantly from purple-red to purple-black, and the fish's shelf life was extended by 2 days compared to the control group without antimicrobial indicator card. According to the comprehensive evaluation, M/OTS@Paper has the best hydrophobicity and has good application prospects in freshness indication packaging."

In this study, a Cu-MOF@CSTA composite adsorbent was synthesized by solidifying Cu-MOF with chitosan/tannic acid and modifying its functional groups to improve uranium adsorption performance. The U(VI) theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of Cu-MOF@CSTA at 288 K (pH = 5) was 2507.73 mg/g, and the adsorption process was characterized as a spontaneous exothermic reaction. The uranium removal rate in mine wastewater (pore water and seepage water) reached 100 %. Uranium removal efficiencies in wastewater containing 100 mg/L fluoride ions, ammonia ions, and urea were remarkably high at 99.34 %, 99.63 %, and 98.94 %, respectively, demonstrating the composite adsorbent's robust anti-jamming capability. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the synergistic effects of hydroxyl, amino, and sulfur functional groups on the Cu-MOF@CSTA surface facilitated uranium adsorption. Competitive adsorption experiments confirmed that Cu-MOF@CSTA exhibits excellent selectivity for uranium. The chitosan, solidified by tannic acid as a flexible carrier, stabilized the Cu-MOF, highlighting its significant potential for uranium adsorption in wastewater treatment applications."

METHODS: Mice were administered CNCT orally at dosages ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 mg/kg/day for a duration of 14 days. Following this treatment, they were infected with T. gondii tachyzoites of the Rh strain to induce acute toxoplasmosis. Then, the mortality rate, parasite load, antioxidant activity, and the gene expression level of proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated. RESULTS: The dimensions of CNTN exhibit variability, with a mean size of 295 nm. The prophylactic administration of CNTN in mice infected with T. gondii resulted in a significant enhancement in survival rates and a considerable decrease in parasite load (P<0.001). The CNTN caused a significant decrease in malondialdehyde level, while a notable increase (P < 0.001) in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes. The feeding the mice infected with CNTN caused a meaningful elevation in the expression level of TNFα- and IL-1β (P<0.001). The biochemical analyses indicated no significant changes in the serum levels of liver and kidney function markers. CONCLUSION: The recent study revealed that CNTN demonstrates promising in vivo effects against toxoplasmosis in murine models. These effects are attributed to its antioxidant properties and immunomodulatory capabilities, which increase specific pro-inflammatory cytokines without any noticeable signs of toxicity to liver and kidney function."

Leveraging the antimicrobial attributes of Ga3+, this coating exhibited inhibitory rates of (84.66 ± 0.001)% against S. aureus and (67.17 ± 0.02)% against E. coli. Moreover, the coating was capable of modulating the polarization of RAW264.7 cells towards the M2 phenotype, effectively reconfiguring the local anti-inflammatory microenvironment. Concurrently, the coating also significantly facilitated HUVEC migration, lumen formation, and the expression of vascularizing growth factors. Interestingly, the coating significantly enhanced MC3T3-E1 differentiation towards osteoblasts, where the expression level of the key osteogenic gene RUNX2 was increased by approximately 2.94-fold. In vivo, the coating also manifested ideal antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, and bone repair capabilities, holistically satisfying the intricate demands of infectious bone repair. In conclusion, TA-Ga/CS-MA@Exo furnishes an efficacious and comprehensive resolution for infected bone repair and harbors substantial potential for clinical application."

      "abstract": "In this study, an imidazole cross-linked chitosan hydrogel (I/CS-4) was synthesized through the Debus-Radziszewski reaction, resulting in a multifunctional adsorbent with both dye adsorption and antimicrobial capabilities. I/CS-4 effectively removed orange G (OG) and metanil yellow (MY) dyes under various environmental conditions, including pH, initial concentration, temperature, and contact time. The hydrogel demonstrated high stability and efficiency over a broad pH range (2-10), attributed to its abundant amino and imidazole groups, which facilitate electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking interactions. The maximum adsorption capacities for OG and MY were 565.00 mg/g and 490.20 mg/g, respectively, following the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Additionally, I/CS-4 showed excellent recyclability, maintaining over 80 % removal efficiency after five cycles. It also exhibited potent antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus while being biocompatible. These results highlight I/CS-4's potential as an effective material for treating dye-containing wastewater, combining efficient contaminant removal with microbial inhibition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity have been associated with an altered intestinal microbiome. Recent investigations have demonstrated that fiber supplementation, including chitosan, can exert beneficial and protective effects on the composition of gut microbiota in humans diagnosed with overweight/obesity. However, there is still a great deal of heated debate regarding the impact of chitosan supplementation in overweight and obese adolescents. Therefore, the aim of this study is to clarify the effects of chitosan administration on the composition of the gut microbiome in overweight and obese adolescents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Sixty-four overweight and obese adolescents were subjected to supplementation with 3 g of chitosan for 12 weeks. Anthropometric indices and physical activity were measured at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. After DNA extraction and purification, the quantity of bacteria in the patients' stool samples was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The RCT was registered on the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.irct.ir ) website (IRCT20091114002709 N57; registration date: 2021 - 06 - 20). RESULTS: Individuals who received chitosan supplementation experienced a significant decrease in the BMI z-score (P < 0.001). Administration of chitosan led to notable significant decrease in the Firmicutes (P < 0.001) populations and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P < 0.001) as well as a notable increase in the Bacteroidetes (P = 0.008) and Akkermansia (P < 0.001) populations, respectively compare to control group. Mean changes in Lactobacillus populations were marginally significant (P = 0.05). Chitosan administration did not alter the composition in Bifidobacterium populations (P = 0.97). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates beneficial effects of chitosan administration on some bacterial species associated with overweight and obesity in adolescents. Further research is needed to confirm our findings and clarify the impact of this intervention on the Lactobacillus population in the gut."

Twenty-one experimental studies including 738 animals were selected. Nerve repair using chitosan conduits resulted in a higher sciatic functional index compared to non-intervention. Higher conduction velocity and a greater number of myelinated fibers were observed in nerve fibers treated with chitosan compared to the no intervention or primary repair groups. However, compound muscle action potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials were superior in the latter compared to nerves treated with the polymer.",

Within this study, we explored the efficacy of lipid-chitosan hybrid nanoparticles with NTD as an ABCB1 inhibitor and PTX as a chemotherapeutic agent in ABCB1 overexpressed ovarian cancer cells. Sensitive ovarian cancer cells acquired resistance by continuous paclitaxel treatment and confirmed by the resistance index and ABCB1 expression by qRT-PCR. PTX-NTD-loaded lipid-chitosan hybrid nanoparticles (N-PTX-LPHNPs) were synthesized via ionic gelation and characterized by the DLS method, in vitro release, encapsulation and loading efficiency, FT-IR and SEM. XTT, Rho-123 accumulation assay, and DCFH-DA staining were conducted to examine the drug resistance inhibition and anti-cancer activity of NTD and N-PTX-LPHNPs. Bioinformatics analyzes were performed to evaluate the ADME/T properties of NTD and the interaction between the PTX-NTD combination and ABCB1. NTD showed high binding affinity to ABCB1 and had cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, the PTX-NTD drug combination loaded nanoparticles increased PTX accumulation and intracellular ROS levels, enhanced anti-cancer activity, and overcame resistance to ovarian cancer. Our results highlight the NTD-PTX-loaded lipid-chitosan hybrid nanoparticles as a potential therapeutic for ABCB1 overexpressed ovarian cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is the major degradation product of chitosan by enzymatic processes. COS, with complete water solubility, exerts significant biological effects, including anti-cancer activity. We investigated the anti-tumor effects of COS on colorectal cancer as effective therapeutic methods with low side effects are lacking. METHODS: COS was obtained from low molecular weight chitosan by an enzymatic method and the anti-cancer effects were measured by cell viability assay, flow cytometry analysis, Western blotting, and xenograft. RESULTS: COS suppressed the proliferation of SNU-C5 cells compared to other colorectal cancer cells, but higher concentrations were required in the xenograft model. Co-treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and COS enhanced the anti-cancer effects of 5-FU in SNU-C5 cells in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry revealed that COS induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase without 5-FU or at the S and G2/M phases with 5-FU but did not affect cell death pathways. COS increased extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation with or without 5-FU, whereas 5-FU treatment increased p53 activation. A low-dose of an ERK inhibitor suppressed COS-induced ERK activation and resulted in higher proliferation compared with COS. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that COS might enhance the anti-cancer effects of 5-FU in SNU-C5 colorectal cancer cells by activating ERK.",

      "abstract": "Sinapic acid (SAc) is a plant-based antioxidant known for its neuroprotective effects. However, its therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains limited because of its low bioavailability in the brain. Therefore, the present study hypothesized safe and effective delivery of SAc using chitosan-coated solid lipid nanoparticles (Cs-SAc-SLNs) via the intranasal route for AD treatment. The characterization of Cs-SAc-SLNs using AFM, SEM, and TEM confirmed their spherical morphology with a particle size of less than 200 nm. Moreover, the Cs-SAc-SLNs demonstrated a sustained drug release of 61.3 ± 1.7 % in 24 h. Remarkably, Cs-SAc-SLNs showed significant cellular uptake (P < 0.05) than uncoated SLNs in the Neuro-2a cell line. The histopathology study using nasal mucosa demonstrated the safety of the formulation, which makes it ideal for intranasal administration. The in vitro sustained drug release is well mapped with the in vivo pharmacokinetics study, indicating a 1.7-fold increase in the half-life (t1/2) of SAc. Interestingly, the chitosan-coated Cs-SAc-SLNs (i.n.) demonstrated a superior AUC0-∞ (3128.05 ± 129.42 ng/g*h) and showed a significant enhancement in brain bioavailability (3.7-fold) in terms of drug targeting efficiency as compared to plain SAc (i.v.). This improved brain delivery contributed to substantial neuroprotective effects in Aβ1-42-induced cognitively impaired mice. The study also supported the decreased biochemical markers levels of oxidative stress, cholinergic activity, and inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α) in the hippocampus and cortex of Aβ1-42-injected mice. Overall, the present study highlights the safe and enhanced cognitive function using chitosan-coated SLNs for AD treatment.",

      "abstract": "Chitosan, derived from the deacetylation of chitin, is the second most widely used natural polymer, valued for its nontoxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable properties. These attributes have driven extensive research into diverse applications of chitosan and various derivatives. The key characteristics of chitosan muco-adhesion, permeability enhancement, drug release modulation, and antimicrobial activity are primarily due to its amino and hydroxyl groups. However, the limited solubility of raw chitosan in water and most organic solvents has posed challenges for broader application. Numerous chemically modified derivatives have been developed to address these inadequacies with improved physical and chemical properties. Among these derivatives, chitosan nanoparticles have emerged as versatile drug carriers with precise release kinetics and the capacity for targeted delivery, greatly enhancing drug efficacy and safety profiles for therapeutic applications. Due to these unique physicochemical properties, chitosan and chitosan nanoparticles are promising for improved drug delivery, vaccine administration, transplantation, gene therapy, and diagnostics. This review examines the physicochemical properties and bioactivities of chitosan and chitosan nanoparticles, emphasizing their broad-ranging biomedical applications."

      "abstract": "As the industrialization process accelerates, environmental pollution issues are becoming increasingly severe, especially water pollution, which poses a serious threat to the ecosystem and human health. Pollutants in water bodies that are difficult to degrade not only exert toxicity to aquatic life but may also accumulate through the food chain, affecting human health. Therefore, the development of efficient and environmentally friendly pollutant treatment technologies has become a popular topic in the field of environmental science. Chitosan (CS), as a natural polysaccharide, is considered an ideal choice for preparing environmentally friendly green materials due to its excellent compatibility, and rich functional groups. CS-based hydrogels, with their unique three-dimensional network structure, high specific surface area, and good hydrophilicity, show great potential in environmental purification. This review aims to systematically summarize and analyze the latest research progress of high-performance chitosan-based hydrogels (HPCSHs) in the field of environment, exploring their performance characteristics, enhancement strategies, and sustainability. Firstly, the structure and characteristics of HPCSHs are introduced, with an emphasis on their adsorptivity, degradability, reusability, environmental responsiveness, biocompatibility, and multifunctionality. Subsequently, four enhancement strategies for hydrogel performance are discussed in detail, including crosslinking modification, surface functionalization, nanomaterials composite, and structure regulation. Then, the environmental impact and sustainability of HPCSHs are assessed. Finally, the current challenges and future development trends are explored. This review provides references and guidance for the research of HPCSHs in the environmental field, offering new solutions for environmental pollution issues."

METHODS: The study used a full-thickness diabetic wound rat model. The hydrogel was applied either daily or on alternate days. H&E, Masson's trichrome, Sirius red and immunohistochemical staining were employed. Two patients with diabetes were recruited for case studies where the hydrogel was applied on alternate days. RESULTS: Under the application of the hydrogel, accelerated healing was observed, with enhanced re-epithelialization and dermal differentiation. The treated groups developed mature skin characteristics absent in the control group, and a well-organized collagen network was observed. There was also accelerated macrophage infiltration, phenotype shift and enhanced angiogenesis at different healing stages. In addition, two patients were positive with alternate-day application of the hydrogel. CONCLUSIONS: The radiation-crosslinked carboxymethyl-chitosan/gelatin hydrogel shows great potential as a promising modality for diabetic wound management, with both daily and alternate-day applications having immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic functions.",

Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRs) is involved in the progression of OSF, and miR manipulation could be a promising therapeutic approach. Nanoformulation can protect exogenous miRs against nuclease degradation and enhance cell retention. Accordingly, chitosan (CS), which possesses an anti-fibrotic capacity, is proposed to encapsulate miRs as nanoparticles (NPs) for treating OSF. miR-negative control (miR-NC)/CS NPs were fabricated by an ionic gelation method and characterized. Human oral submucosal fibroblasts were first subjected to arecoline stimulation to induce myofibroblast differentiation and were then transfected with a miR-145 inhibitor or miR-424 inhibitor using CS NPs. For CS NPs loaded with miR-NC, the particle size was 121.9 ± 0.1 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.162 ± 0.004 and zeta potential of + 22.4 ± 0.5 mV. Transfection of these two miRs downregulated mRNA levels of transforming growth factor beta 1, actin alpha 2 smooth muscle, collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), COL3A1, COL4A1, matrix metalloproteinase 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2, and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 in myofibroblasts. A Western blot analysis revealed that miR/CS NP transfection decreased alpha-smooth muscle actin and type 1 collagen protein products. Furthermore, the wound closure ability of stimulated cells was inhibited upon transfection. In conclusion. CS NPs are a good delivery vehicle for miR transfection. Transfection of a miR-145 inhibitor and miR-424 inhibitor inhibited the TGF-β signaling pathway and decreased ECM component production, and could thus be a promising treatment for OSF."

Two months after surgery, membranes with regenerated nerves were analyzed morphologically, and for gene and protein expression for the evaluation of nerve regeneration and vascularization. Rat penises were assessed for smooth muscle content, morphology, and tissue arrangement. Primary sensory neuron cultures and DRG explants were cultured on micro-grooved chitosan-blended membranes, to evaluate axonal orientation on different topographies. RESULTS: Regenerated nerve fibers and newly formed vessels colonized the whole CS-membrane. The regenerative process was also confirmed by gene and protein expression analyses. The target organ exhibited remodeling of smooth muscle tissue around sinusoidal spaces, indicating potential restoration of cavernous tissue. The quantitative analyses of α-actin smooth muscle (α-SMA) expression in CS-MEM groups displayed α-SMA protein signals comparable to controls. In-vitro experiments on micro-patterned membranes displayed oriented axonal growth, showing valuable insights into the ways in which topographical features can be considered for a more effective performance in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Chitosan-blended membranes promote nerve fiber regeneration in an in-vivo model of nerve lesion that resembles the damage to the NVB occurring in men after radical prostatectomy. These results highlight the promising potential of this device in the clinical urological field, thus suggesting that the application of orientated micro-patterned membranes could further improve nerve regeneration.",

      "abstract": "When neurons are sufficiently stimulated, they generate electrical signals with rapid voltage changes, and information is transferred between neurons through neurites. Chitosan carbon dots (CS CDs) possess unique optical properties, excellent biocompatibility, and superior electron transfer capabilities, making them promising materials for nerve tissue repair and replacement. Studies have shown that exosome (EXO) secretion by PC12 cells and neurite formation are critical for neural tissue repair. However, the effects of CDs on EXO secretion and neurite formation in an electric field microenvironment remain poorly explored. This study utilized CS to synthesize CDs and examined their impact on EXO secretion by PC12 cells in an electric field microenvironment. Findings demonstrated that CS-citric acid (CA) CDs had an average particle size of 4.5 nm with a lattice spacing of 0.248 nm and primarily consisted of graphitized carbon nuclei, hydroxyl, and amino groups. CS-CA CDs played a critical role in facilitating neurite elongation, especially with an electric field intensity of about 50 V/m. The combination of CS-CA CDs and electric field enhanced GAP43 expression in EXO secreted by PC12 cells. These results suggest that CS CDs have great potential for nerve injury treatment, repair, and regeneration."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study investigates the theranostic potential of doped ferrite nanoparticles (NPs) with self-regulating temperature (SRT) properties, termed M55, coated with glucose (GM55), chitosan (CM55), and poly-ethylene glycol (PM55). The NPs were assessed for their physicochemical attributes, magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) efficacy, dual-imaging capabilities in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI), cytocompatibility, and cellular uptake. METHODS: Physicochemical characterization was conducted using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential measurements. The biocompatibility and cellular uptake were evaluated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and MFH performance was tested in vitro. Following intravenous administration, MRI and MPI functionalities were analyzed through phantom studies and in vivo murine models. RESULTS: Coated M55 NPs displayed high colloidal stability in water and effective functionalization. The specific absorption rate (SAR) of 24.4 ± 1.4 W/g confirmed their suitability for MFH applications. In vitro assays indicated excellent biocompatibility and substantial cellular internalization, with GM55 showing the highest uptake and MFH efficiency, reducing cell viability to 50.62 ± 3.92% post two treatment cycles, compared to 67.71 ± 6.11% (CM55) and 71.39 ± 5.84% (PM55). MRI transverse relaxivity (r2) values were notably high across all coatings, enhancing imaging contrast. MPI analysis demonstrated superior cell labeling sensitivity, with GM55 achieving the most pronounced detection. In vivo imaging confirmed effective NPs accumulation in the liver, underscoring their utility as dual MRI/MPI contrast agents (CAs). CONCLUSION: Coated M55 NPs exhibit significant promise as multifunctional theranostic agents for cancer treatment. GM55, in particular, offers superior MFH efficacy and cellular uptake, while CM55 and PM55 may present unique advantages for alternative biomedical applications. The dual-imaging capabilities of these NPs provide a robust platform for real-time monitoring of distribution and therapeutic outcomes. Future investigations will focus on optimizing NPs formulations and expanding in vivo assessments to advance clinical translation.",

The objective of this research is to develop synbiotic capsules with natural substances such as chitosan, alginate, and L. fermentum. Encapsulation is a significant tool in medicine, helping to improve targeted medication delivery and bioavailability. The chitosan/alginate-encapsulated probiotic (CAP) beads increase the bioavailability of probiotics in the gut, allowing for a more effective response to ACR-induced toxicity. The combination of prebiotic and probiotic activity improves stability, viability, and gastrointestinal delivery. We developed CAP beads and assessed their survivability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, encapsulating efficiency, and release profile. The efficacy of these beads in reducing the harmful effects of ACR was subsequently investigated using a Drosophila melanogaster model. Under co-exposure and pre-treatment settings, in vivo studies revealed restoration of locomotor activities, redox balance, and ovarian mitochondrial membrane potential in flies treated with CAP beads. Furthermore, implying the indirect impact of CAP beads on gut microbiota and xenobiotic metabolism, pre-treatment with CAP more successfully restored the expression of important antioxidant and stress-related genes, including sod, cat, InR, rpr, and p53.",

      "abstract": "As a notoriously incurable tumor, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits significant sensitivity to ferroptosis and the glutathione (GSH) antioxidant defense system plays a crucial role in its progression. Herein, we report a bimetallic chitosan/hyaluronic acid nanoparticle (5FCN, with a Fe/Cu mass ratio of 5:5) that employs a self-amplified dual mechanism of ferroptosis and cuproptosis for TNBC therapy. Hyaluronic acid in 5FCN specifically binds to the overexpressed CD44 receptor on TNBC cells. This allows 5FCN to enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, then release metal ions in acidic environments. Released Fe3+ and Cu2+ react with GSH in tumor cells, weakening the antioxidant system and producing Fe2+ and Cu+. These ions trigger Fenton/Fenton-like reactions with H2O2, generating toxic hydroxyl radicals (·OH) to boost ferroptosis. Meanwhile, high-valent Cu2+ and Fe3+ are produced, forming a cycle for GSH depletion and ·OH generation. As H2O2 depletes, the rising Cu+ level in cells causes lipoylated protein aggregation, amplifying cuproptosis. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that 5FCN exhibited superior cell-killing efficacy against TNBC with few side effects. Collectively, 5FCN represents a potential drug to self-amplify ferroptosis/cuproptosis in TNBC."

To compare the efficacy and safety of PMCMC-containing emulsion and petrolatum, we conducted a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Eligible patients were children aged 1-<6 years who had mild atopic dermatitis (with Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI] ≤7.0). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PMCMC-containing emulsion or petrolatum. Study treatments were applied to the body twice daily for 8 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were the changes in EASI and total score of Quality of life in Primary Caregivers of children with Atopic Dermatitis (QP-CAD) from baseline to the end of the treatment. RESULTS: Between February 2020 and August 2022, 80 participants (39, emulsion group; 41, petrolatum group) were enrolled and included in the analysis. The decrease in EASI at the end of the treatment was greater in the emulsion group than in the petrolatum group with the LS mean (SE) change of -0.74 (0.31) in the emulsion group and 0.29 (0.31) in the petrolatum group (difference -1.02, 95% CI -1.90 to -0.15; p = .022). The decrease in total QP-CAD was also greater in the emulsion group than in the petrolatum group with the LS mean (SE) change of -1.63 (1.08) and 1.55 (1.01), respectively (difference -3.18, 95% CI -6.13 to -0.22; p = .035). All adverse events in the emulsion group were mild. CONCLUSION: PMCMC-containing emulsion significantly improved disease severity of children and quality of life of caregivers compared with petrolatum.

The dentin-pulp complex, as the biological core of the tooth, can generate reparative dentin to protect the dental pulp from infection progression. However, untreated carious lesions chronically disrupt the structural integrity and reparative capacity of the dentin-pulp complex, thereby significantly compromising pulp vitality as deep caries progresses. In this study, a two-stepped pH-responsive peptide microsphere/carboxymethyl chitosan complex (PM/CS) was designed to offer comprehensive protection for the inflamed dentin-pulp complex. PM/CS has a three-dimensional network structure, and it constructs an intelligent drug delivery system by integrating TVH-19 self-assembled peptide microspheres that we developed earlier into carboxymethyl chitosan. This complex not only exhibited pH-controlled release characteristics, but also showed antibacterial properties against Streptococcus mutans and a mineralization-promoting effect on human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). PM/CS exerted acute anti-inflammatory effects on early pulpal lesions in rats, while longitudinal studies revealed its remarkable capacity to induce tertiary dentinogenesis, indicating therapeutic efficacy through biological modulation. This study provides a potential pulp capping complex material for the restoration treatment of the dentin-pulp complex under the influence of deep caries.",

Developing strategies to enhance wheat's resilience to salinity is critical for maintaining yield in affected regions. This study investigates the potential of chitosan-proline (Cs-Pro) and chitosan-glycine (Cs-Gly) nanoparticles in mitigating salt stress in salt-tolerant Heydari and salt-sensitive Sepahan wheat cultivars, with a special question on genotype-dependent differences. Plants were treated with nanoparticles at concentrations of 0, 200, and 400 mg L⁻¹ under salt stress levels of 0, 200, and 400 mM NaCl. The salt-tolerant Heydari cultivar exhibited superior adaptability to saline conditions, in addition reacted more positively to nanoparticle treatments. Results demonstrated significant physiological improvements, including increased relative water content (RWC), enhanced chlorophyll content and elevated proline levels, especially after 400 mg L⁻¹ Cs-Pro treatment. Oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide, were substantially reduced, while antioxidant enzyme activity was boosted. Certain stress-responsive genes (e.g., TaADC, TaPxPAO, TaSAMDC, TaSPDS, TaSOS1, TaNHX1) were upregulated, highlighting the importance of ionic balance and polyamine metabolism in improved stress tolerance.

FeSO4 triggered ferroptosis in P. aeruginosa planktonic cells, decreased the ratio of glutathione to oxidized glutathione, and resulted in the increase of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, damaging the integrity of the cell membrane. In addition, FeSO4 prevented P. aeruginosa from forming biofilms on the surface of stainless steel, glass, and high-density polyethylene. Transcriptome analyses indicated that there were 412 up-regulated genes and 782 down-regulated genes following FeSO4 treatment. FeSO4 increased the cross-linking density of a carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) agar-based film, reducing its water solubility, swelling degree, water vapor permeability, and oxygen permeability. Finally, FeSO4@CMCS agar-based film showed potential antibacterial ability against the growth of P. aeruginosa in grapes, purple kale, and cherry tomatoes during storage."

Combination therapies, coupled with nanotechnology-based co-delivery systems, offer enhanced efficacy by targeting multiple pathways in cancer progression. In this study, we developed an injectable, stimuli-responsive nanosystem using a chitosan hydrogel embedded with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for the co-administration of 5-fluorouracil and everolimus. This approach aims to optimize controlled drug release, enhance the synergistic anticancer effect, and overcome challenges associated with co-loading different therapeutic agents. METHODS: Various techniques were employed to characterize the nanoparticles and the hydrogel. Cell uptake, apoptosis, and proliferation of 4T1 breast cancer cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and Resazurin assay, respectively. The Balb/C mice model of breast cancer, which received the therapeutical nanoplatforms subcutaneously near the tumoral region was used to examine tumor size and lung metastases. RESULTS: The results revealed that the nanoparticles had a suitable loading capacity and high cellular uptake. The drug release was pH-sensitive and synergistic. By incorporating nanoparticles into the hydrogel, the cell death rate and apoptosis of 4T1 breast cancer cells increased significantly, due to the synergistic effects of co-delivered drugs. Additionally, the combination treatment groups showed a significant reduction in tumor size and lung metastasis compared to the monotherapy and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential of the nanocomposite used to develop a novel co-delivery system to enhance therapeutic outcomes, reduce side effects, and provide a promising new strategy for future cancer treatments.",

      "abstract": "Guided bone regeneration (GBR) technique is a standard therapy for reconstructing alveolar bone defects clinically, with the GBR membrane serving as the key medical device in this technique. However, the most commonly used collagen barrier membranes usually have poor mechanical properties and are prone to collapse during clinical use. Herein, a sandwich-like barrier membrane was developed with crosslinked chitosan as dense layer, crosslinked collagen as loose layer and passivated magnesium mesh as the skeleton. Surface modification has improved the corrosion resistance of magnesium mesh. Thanks to the introduction of magnesium mesh skeleton and crosslinking modification, the mechanical properties and supporting effects of barrier membrane have been improved. The dense layer of barrier membrane showed dense structure while the loose layer showed porous structure as expected. The barrier membrane showed good antibacterial performance against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria owing to the antibacterial activity of chitosan and the added chlorhexidine acetate. Furthermore, the barrier membrane met the requirements of biocompatibility for implanted biomaterials. Interestingly, the barrier membrane had good anti-inflammatory activity to accelerate the transition from inflammatory to proliferative stage and can promote osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Overall, the sandwich-like barrier membrane has a wide application prospect to guide bone regeneration."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental caries, the leading cause of dental pain and the most prevalent chronic childhood disease globally, significantly impacts children's oral health, with prevalence ranging from 16% to 92.2% in India. Untreated caries in deciduous teeth can lead to pain, dietary changes, sleep disturbances, and enamel defects in permanent teeth. Pediatric dentists manage infected pulp with pulp therapy or extraction. Postoperative complications, such as discomfort and bleeding, are common in extraction cases. AIM: This study aims to compare the analgesic and hemostatic efficacy of chitosan and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in pediatric extractions, hypothesizing no significant difference between the two. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This crossover randomized clinical trial was carried out within 87 primary molars from 29 participants. The study participants were randomized into three distinct groups, each with a specific order of interventions: Group A first received the control, followed by laser, and then chitosan; Group B first underwent the laser intervention, followed by chitosan, and finally the control; and Group C first experienced the chitosan intervention, followed by the control, and then laser. After extraction of the primary molar, properly shaped gauze piece, a 940-nm wavelength diode laser (diode Epic, BioLase, USA) was used in a continuous mode with 400 um diameter fiber tip at an approximately 8 mm away from the teeth socket without contact until 1 min, chitosan Sponge of 7 mm was measured using a periodontal probe and was placed into the extraction socket, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23 (IBM), with a significance level set at 5%. RESULTS: The mean pain score was least for the LLLT group, followed by the Chitosan group and the maximum mean pain score was recorded for the control group and this difference was statistically significant, whereas there was no significant difference regarding the postoperative bleeding after 15 min between three groups. Chitosan was the intervention of choice for both the children and their guardians. CONCLUSION: Soft-tissue diode lasers can be utilized for postoperative pain management subsequent to deciduous tooth extraction in children. This would reduce the reliance on analgesic medication and eliminate the possibility of adverse effects. Chitosan can serve as a highly effective, dependable, and cost-effective substitute in case of the diode laser's inaccessibility.",
