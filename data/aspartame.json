      "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners' neurotoxicity remains a significant health concern. This study investigated the neurotoxic effects of aspartame (ASP) and evaluated the neuroprotective potential of Tetrapleura tetraptera ethanol extract (TT) in Wistar rats. Thirty male rats were grouped into six (n = 5) and some received oral ASP administration for 14 days, with some groups post-treated with TT (200 and 400 mg/kg) orally for 14 days. Neurotransmitter function, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic parameters were assessed using biochemical assays and RT-PCR on serum and brain tissues after the sacrifice. ASP significantly (p < 0.001) increased AChE and BChE activities while decreasing dopamine levels. RT-PCR analysis revealed that ASP upregulated pro-inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and pro-apoptotic markers (BAX, CASP3, CASP9, P53) while downregulating anti-apoptotic BCL-2 gene expression. ASP also reduced antioxidant levels (GSH, GCL), elevated S100B level and activated cAMP/PKA signalling. TT post-treatment significantly (p < 0.001) reversed these alterations, reducing MDA and GSSG levels while enhancing GSH/GSSG ratio and antioxidant activities. TT markedly downregulated inflammatory markers and upregulated IL-10 expression. Histopathological examination suggests TT's protective effects against ASP-induced neural damage. These findings indicate that TT exhibits neuroprotective properties through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities against ASP-induced neurotoxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence suggests that maternal intake of nonnutritive sweeteners is positively associated with early childhood asthma incidence. We investigated the effects of maternal aspartame exposure during pregnancy and lactation on lung Th1/Th2 cytokine balance and intestinal microbiota in offspring and explored the mechanisms that mediate these effects. METHOD: Pregnant BALB/c mice were randomly divided on gestational day 7 into two dietary intervention groups: control (drinking water only) and aspartame (drinking water +0.25 g/L aspartame) groups. The dams nursed their offspring for 3 weeks. On postnatal day 21, heart blood samples were collected, and immunoglobulin E levels were measured. Microorganisms from the lower gastrointestinal tract were sampled using a culture-independent approach. Lung tissues were harvested for biochemical analyses. RESULTS: Maternal aspartame exposure increased the body weight of the dams from gestational day 7 to postnatal day 21 and the body weight of the offspring from birth to postnatal day 21. Maternal aspartame exposure significantly increased the levels of Th2 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and IL-17 and immunoglobulin E but reduced that of a Th1 cytokine (interferon-γ) in the offspring's lung tissues. The altered Th1/Th2 balance was accompanied by increased lung nuclear factor-κB activation. The bacterial composition and alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota of the offspring did not differ significantly between the control and aspartame groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest maternal aspartame exposure influences lung Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in offspring through nuclear factor-κB activation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aspartame is a nonnutritive sweetener (NSS), which is widely used in foods and beverages worldwide. The safety of aspartame, a commonly used artificial sweetener, has been debated. Here, we investigated the potential effects and underlying mechanisms of aspartame consumption during pregnancy on placental dysfunction and birth outcomes. METHODS: Female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to a low (30 mg/kg) or high (60 mg/kg) dose of aspartame before and during pregnancy; moreover, we assessed placental histopathological structure, oxidative stress markers, and mitochondrial function. In addition, we explored how aspartame affects birth weight in a human maternal-infant cohort. RESULTS: In animal study revealed that aspartame treatment of female rats for 14 weeks (12 week before pregnancy and 18 days of gestation) causes a significant reduction in the number and weight of fetuses, as well as damage to placental structure. These effects are linked to increased oxidative stress in the placenta, possibly damaging placental trophoblasts, impairing mitochondrial function, and initiating a compensatory mitochondrial biosynthesis mechanism. In the human pregnant cohort revealed that aspartame reduces birth weight considerably. DISCUSSION: These findings suggested the potential risks associated with aspartame consumption during pregnancy. Therefore, the safety of aspartame, particularly in pregnant individuals, should be reconsidered; specifically, tailored, acceptable daily intake guidelines should be developed for aspartame in different populations.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aspartame, invented in 1965 by GD-Searle, is an intense artificial sweetener taste approximately 200 times as sweet as sucrose and used as an additive in more than 6,000 products. Aspartame (APM) was submitted for pre-marketing safety evaluation in early 1980. The studies, performed by GD-Searle, produced controversial results. AREAS COVERED: Because of the great commercial diffusion of aspartame, in 1997 the Ramazzini Institute (RI) started a large experimental project on rodents to test the carcinogenic effects of aspartame following an experimental model with more sensitive characteristics, namely a large number of rat and mice, starting treatment from prenatal life, observation until spontaneous death. Overall, the project included studying 2270 rats and 852 mice. These studies have shown that aspartame is a carcinogenic agent in experimental animals, inducing a significant dose-related increased incidence of several types of malignant tumors and, among them, hematological neoplasia, and liver cancer. EXPERT OPINION: The results of these studies on aspartame by the Ramazzini Institute opened a real front on the evaluation of artificial sweeteners and their possible health risks. Adequate long-term carcinogenicity bioassays on other diffuse artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame-k, sucralose, saccharin, including their blends, are likewise important for public health.",

      "abstract": "Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, is consumed by millions of people globally. There are multiple reports of aspartame and its metabolites affecting cognitive functions in animal models and humans, which include learning problems, headaches, seizures, migraines, irritable moods, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. These cognitive deficits and associated symptoms are partly attributed to dysregulated excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter balance due to aspartate released from aspartame, resulting in an excitotoxic effect in neurons, leading to neuronal damage. However, microglia, a central immunocompetent cell type in brain tissue and a significant player in inflammation can contribute to the impact. Microglia rapidly respond to changes in CNS homeostasis. Aspartame consumption might affect the microglia phenotype directly via methanol-induced toxic effects and indirectly via aspartic acid-mediated excitotoxicity, exacerbating symptoms of cognitive decline. Long-term oral consumption of aspartame thus might change microglia's phenotype from ramified to activated, resulting in chronic or sustained activation, releasing excess pro-inflammatory molecules. This pro-inflammatory surge might lead to the degeneration of healthy neurons and other glial cells, impairing cognition. This review will deliberate on possible links and research gaps that need to be explored concerning aspartame consumption, ecotoxicity and microglia-mediated inflammatory cognitive impairment. The study covers a comprehensive analysis of the impact of aspartame consumption on cognitive function, considering both direct and indirect effects, including the involvement of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. We also propose a novel intervention strategy involving tryptophan supplementation to mitigate cognitive decline symptoms in individuals with prolonged aspartame consumption, providing a potential solution to address the adverse effects of aspartame on cognitive function.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: The disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, gut microbiota (GM) community, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) is a triggering factor for pubertal onset. The study investigates the effects of the long-term intake of aspartame on puberty and GM in animals and humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aspartame-fed female offspring rats result in vaginal opening time prolongation, serum estrogen reduction, and serum luteinizing hormone elevation. , 60 mg kg-1 aspartame treatment decreases the mRNA levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), Kiss1, and G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54), increases the mRNA level of RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3), and decreases the expression of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus. Significant differences in relative bacterial abundance at the genus levels and decreased fecal SCFA levels are noted by 60 mg kg-1 aspartame treatment. Among which, Escherichia-Shigella is negatively correlated with several SCFAs. In girls, high-dose aspartame consumption decreases the risk of precocious puberty. CONCLUSIONS: Aspartame reduces the chance of puberty occurring earlier than usual in female offspring and girls. Particularly, 60 mg kg-1 aspartame-fed female offspring delays pubertal onset through the dysregulation of HPG axis and GM composition by inhibiting the Kiss1/GPR54 system and inducing the RFRP-3. An acceptable dose of aspartame should be recommended during childhood.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent reassessment of the safety of aspartame has prompted increased evaluation of its effect on the health of a range of tissues. The gut microbiome is altered by oral aspartame. One prior study suggested that changes in the microbiome caused by aspartame could influence the strength of bone in young skeletally developing mice. Here we ask how aspartame influences bone in mice of different age and sex. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of aspartame on the bone strength and gut microbiota of young and aged mice. METHODS: Male and female C57Bl/6J mice were untreated or treated with a high dose of aspartame in their drinking water from 1 month of age until 4 (young cohort; n = 80) or 22 months (aged cohort; n = 52). RESULTS: In aged males, mice treated with aspartame had greater body mass, whole bone strength, and femoral geometry relative to untreated. Specifically, in aged males, aspartame led to 9% increase in body mass (p < 0.001), 22% increase in whole bone strength (p = 0.006), and 17% increase in section modulus (p < 0.001) relative to untreated mice. Aged males and females receiving aspartame had a different microbiota than untreated mice and a decreased abundance of Odoribacter. No differences in body mass, whole bone strength, or femoral geometry were associated with aspartame dosing in young males or young or aged females. CONCLUSIONS: Aspartame treated aged males had greater whole bone strength and the effect appeared to be explained by greater body mass. Aspartame treatment did not alter whole bone strength in young males or young or aged females despite the aspartame having a similar effect on the microbiota of both aged males and females."

Therefore, we compared the effects of consuming four different sugars on insulin sensitivity indices derived from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). (2) Methods: Young adults consumed fructose-, glucose-, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-, sucrose-, or aspartame-sweetened beverages (SB) for 2 weeks.

Outcomes were analyzed to determine: (1) effects of the five SB; (2) effects of the proportions of fructose and glucose in all SB. (3) Results: Fructose-SB and the fructose component in mixed sugars negatively affected outcomes that assess hepatic insulin sensitivity, while glucose did not. The effects of glucose-SB and the glucose component in mixed sugar on muscle insulin sensitivity were more negative than those of fructose. (4) Conclusion: the effects of consuming sugar-SB on insulin sensitivity varied depending on type of sugar and ISI index because outcomes assessing hepatic insulin sensitivity were negatively affected by fructose, and outcomes assessing muscle insulin sensitivity were more negatively affected by glucose.",

Extract of turmeric rhizome (Curcuma longa) (TUR) and extract of bitter melon (Momordica charantia) (BM) is known to have antioxidant activity. The present study was aimed to examine the neuroprotective potential of TUR and BM extracts, either as single or as combination, against the effects of aspartame in the brain. Here, Sprague-Dawley rats fed with aspartame (40 mg/kg BW) for 28 days were compared with rats fed with extract and aspartame. To assess neuroprotective potential, rats were given extract 7 days before and during aspartame treatment. Spatial memory was assessed with Morris water maze test followed with H&E staining of hippocampal region. Brain lipid peroxidation and enzymatic activity of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured to probe status of oxidative stress in the brain. Aspartame-treated rats demonstrated spatial memory impairment and reduced number of hippocampal cells and elevated levels of MDA, downregulated activity of GPx and elevated activity of AChE. In contrast, animals received both aspartame and extract demonstrated better spatial memory function, higher number of hippocampal areas, increased GPX activity, reduced MDA levels, and decreased AChE activity were observed in the brain of extract-treated rats. Taken together, our results suggest that extract of TUR rhizome and BM fruit exhibit antioxidant activity which may contribute to the neuroprotective effects against aspartame-induced memory impairment in rats."

Here, we compared the effects of ASP and sucrose on mice pancreatic islet cells in vivo and observed that ASP with the condition of high concentration and long-term exposure (HASP) could cause insulin secretion (500 mg/kg for 1 month). Next, we conducted iTRAQ mass spectrometry to profile the global phosphoproteome and found that phosphorylation of zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) in murine pancreatic islet tissues were induced at Thr197, Thr242, Thr282, and Ser328 by high-sucrose (HS) treatment, but only induced at Thr197 and Ser328 by HASP treatment. Simultaneously, phosphorylation of STAT3 could be induced at Tyr705 and Ser727 by HS but not by HASP. Furthermore, presence of activated STAT3 accompanied with autophagy was observed in HS treatment. In turn, the inactivation of STAT3 as well as enhanced expression of caspase 3 was observed in HASP treatment. We generated Thr242APro and Thr282Pro on ZIPK using CRISPR-Cas9 in β-TC3 cells and found the weakened interaction with STAT3 as well as the reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 even under HS stimulation. Finally, we observed that ankyrin repeat domain containing 11 (ANKRD11) could interact with ZIPK and play an inhibitory role in the phosphorylation of Thr242APro and Thr282Pro of ZIPK. However, HASP can induce the retention of ANKRD11 in the cytoplasm by phenylpyruvic acid (the metabolite of ASP). Taken together, this study determined that ASP with high concentration and long-term exposure could lead to caspase-dependent apoptosis of pancreatic islet cells through ANKRD11/ZIPK/STAT3 inhibition. Our results give evidence of adverse effects of aspartame on islet cells in some extreme conditions, which might help people to reconsider the biosafety of non-nutritive sweeteners.",

RESULTS: Present study reports that female mice treated with aspartame for 30 and 60 days showed significant reduction in body weight, relative organ weight of (liver and kidney) and gonadosomatic index. These changes were more significantly recorded in 60 days treatment group. Aspartame treated animals for 30 and 60 days showed duration-dependent decrease gonandotropins (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone), and steroids (estradiol and progesterone). Moreover, severe histopathological changes, reduction in number of growing follicles, degenerative changes in follicular structure, corona radiata and zonagranulosa were also observed. Besides, histomorphological changes were also observed in the uterine structure including atrophic uterine endometrial glands, contracted endometrial lining, disruption of the endometrial structure and the shapes of blood vessels were also altered. CONCLUSION: Non-nutritive artificial sweeteners including aspartame negatively impact the function of ovaries and feedback mechanism of reproductive hormones by affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. In light of present findings the aspartame negatively impacted the reproductive system of female mice. More studies are required to identify the molecular mechanism and the pathways involved.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of dietary inclusions of aspartame and sucrose on some selected behavioral and biochemical indices linked with Alzheimer's disease in a transgenic fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) model expressing human amyloid precursor protein and secretase. Flies were raised on a diet supplemented with sucrose and aspartame for 14 days. Thereafter, the flies were assessed for their survival rate, learning and memory, as well as locomotor performance, 14 days post-treatment. This was followed by homogenising the fly heads, and the homogenates were assayed for acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase activities, as well as levels of lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, and total thiol. The results showed aspartame at all levels of dietary intake and a high proportion of sucrose significantly aggravated the mortality rate, locomotor deficiency, and impaired biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status in the transgenic flies, while no significant effect was found on acetylcholinesterase activity or memory function. These findings therefore suggest that while low dietary inclusions of sucrose are tolerable under AD-like phenotypes in the flies, high inclusions of sucrose and all proportions of aspartame tested aggravated mortality rate, locomotion and oxidative stress in the flies."

      "abstract": "Aspartame (ASP) is a common sweetener, but studies show it can harm the nervous system, causing learning and memory deficits. β-caryophyllene (BCP), a natural compound found in foods, including bread, coffee, alcoholic beverages, and spices, has already described as a neuroprotector agent. Remarkably, ASP and BCP are commonly consumed, including in the same meal. Therefore, considering that (a) the BCP displays plenty of beneficial effects; (b) the ASP toxicity; and (c) that they can be consumed in the same meal, this study sought to investigate if the BCP would mitigate the memory impairment induced by ASP in rats and investigate the involvement of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/ tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrKB) signaling pathway and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Young male Wistar rats received ASP (75 mg/kg; i.g.) and/or BCP (100 mg/kg; i.p.) once daily, for 14 days. At the end of the treatment, the animals were evaluated in the open field and object recognition tests. The cerebral cortex and hippocampus samples were collected for biochemical and molecular analyses. Results showed that the BCP effectively protected against the cognitive damage caused by ASP in short and long-term memories. In addition, BCP mitigated the increase in AChE activity caused by ASP. Molecular insights revealed augmented BDNF and TrKB levels in the hippocampus of rats treated with BCP, indicating greater activation of this pathway. In conclusion, BCP protected against ASP-induced memory impairment. AChE activity and the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway seem to be potential targets of BCP modulatory role in this study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder in which especially high phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations cause brain dysfunction. If untreated, this brain dysfunction results in severe microcephaly, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. Dietary restriction of Phe is the mainstay of PKU treatment, with long-term successful outcomes. Aspartame, an artificial sweetener sometimes added into medications, is metabolized in the gut into Phe. Then, patients suffering from PKU on a Phe-restricted diet should avoid consumption of aspartame. The aim of our study was to evaluate the number of drugs containing aspartame and/or Phe as an excipient, and to quantify their corresponding Phe intake. METHODS: The list of drugs marketed in France containing aspartame and/or Phe was established using a national medication database called \"Theriaque\". For each drug, the corresponding daily Phe intake was calculated according to age and weight and was distributed into 3 categories: high (> 40 mg/d), medium (10 to 40 mg/d) and low (< 10 mg/d) Phe intake. RESULTS: The number of drugs containing Phe or its precursor aspartame remained very limited (n = 401). Among the aspartame containing drugs, Phe intakes were significant (medium or high) for only half of them whereas there were negligible for the others. Furthermore, these medications with a significant Phe intake were limited to few pharmaceutical classes (mainly antiinfectives agents, analgesics, and drugs for nervous system), and within these classes the drugs were limited to a small number of molecules, including principally amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and paracetamol/ acetaminophen. DISCUSSION: In situations requiring the use of these molecules, we propose as an alternative, the use of an aspartame-free form of these molecules or a form with a low Phe intake. If it is not possible, we propose as second-line the use of another antibiotics or analgesics. Finally, we have to remember the benefits-risk balance to use medications containing significant Phe intake in PKU patients. Indeed, it may be better to use a Phe containing medication in the absence of an aspartame-free form of this drug rather than to leave a person with PKU without treatment.",

      "abstract": "Due to a worldwide increase in obesity and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, synthetic sweeteners such as aspartame are frequently used to substitute sugar in the diet. Possible uncertainties regarding aspartame's ability to induce oxidative stress, amongst others, has led to the recommendation of a daily maximum dose of 40 to 50 mg per kg. To date, little is known about the effects of this non-nutritive sweetener on cellular lipid homeostasis, which, besides elevated oxidative stress, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, treatment of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y with aspartame (271.7 µM) or its three metabolites (aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol (271.7 µM)), generated after digestion of aspartame in the human intestinal tract, resulted in significantly elevated oxidative stress associated with mitochondrial damage, which was illustrated with reduced cardiolipin levels, increased gene expression of SOD1/2, PINK1, and FIS1, and an increase in APF fluorescence. In addition, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with aspartame or aspartame metabolites led to a significant increase in triacylglycerides and phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines, accompanied by an accumulation of lipid droplets inside neuronal cells. Due to these lipid-mediating properties, the use of aspartame as a sugar substitute should be reconsidered and the effects of aspartame on the brain metabolism should be addressed in vivo.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity has risen dramatically over recent years, and so has the prevalence of adverse obesity-associated pregnancy outcomes. To combat obesity, the calorie contents of many foods and beverages may be reduced by the use of artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame. However, animal studies suggest that aspartame and its metabolites may exhibit toxicity, and the effects of aspartame on pregnancy are largely unknown. In this study, we treated pregnant mice with aspartame by oral gavage and found that the treatment decreased fasting blood glucose level, whereas systolic blood pressure was elevated. Importantly, the aspartame-treated animals also had low placenta and fetus weights, as well as reduced thickness of the placenta decidua layer. Moreover, aspartame decreased the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition proteins and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in mouse placentae. In order to clarify the mechanisms though which aspartame affects placenta, we performed experiments on 3A-sub-E trophoblasts. In the cells, aspartame treatments induced cell cycle arrest and reduced the proliferation rate, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration activity and invasion activity. We also found that aspartame increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to hyper-activate Akt and downregulate MnSOD expression. Pretreatment with antioxidants or sweet taste receptor inhibitors reversed the effects of aspartame on trophoblast function. We also found that the aspartame metabolite phenylalanine similarly induced ROS production and affected proliferation of trophoblasts. Taken together, our data suggest that aspartame consumption during pregnancy may impact the structure, growth and function of the placenta via sweet taste receptor-mediated stimulation of oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Frequent consumption of diet drinks was associated with oocyte dysmorphism, decreased embryo quality, and an adverse effect on pregnancy rate. We investigated the harmful effects of aspartame and potential mechanisms through which it increases infertility risk through clinical observations and in vivo and in vitro studies. Methods: We established a cohort of 840 pregnant women and retrospectively determined their time to conceive. We assessed the estrus cycle, the anti-Mullerian hormone level, ovarian oxidative stress, and ovarian mitochondrial function in an animal study. We also evaluated mitochondria function, mitochondrial biogenesis, and progesterone release with in vitro studies. Aspartame consumption was associated with increased infertility risk in the younger women (Odds ratio: 1.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 3.22). The results of the in vivo study revealed that aspartame disrupted the estrus cycle and reduced the anti-Mullerian hormone level. Aspartame treatment also suppressed antioxidative activities and resulted in higher oxidative stress in the ovaries and granulosa cells. This phenomenon is caused by an aspartame-induced decline in mitochondrial function (maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and ATP production capacity) and triggered mitochondrial biogenesis (assessed by examining the energy depletion signaling-related factors sirtuin-1, phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α, and nuclear respiratory factor 1 expression levels). Aspartame may alter fertility by reserving fewer follicles in the ovary and disrupting steroidogenesis in granulosa cells. Hence, women preparing for pregnancy are suggested to reduce aspartame consumption and avoid oxidative stressors of the ovaries.",

However, there are few reports on the effect of aspartame on social insects living in the soil. The present study was designed to evaluate aspartame toxicity for Polyrhachis vicina Roger. Five dosages of aspartame were fed to the workers and 40 mg/kg (acceptable daily intake, ADI) aspartame was chosen to feed the 4th instar larvae, pupae, females and males in P. vicina. The results showed that the effect of aspartame on the survival rate of workers was in a time and dose dependent manner. The survival rate of 4th instar larvae, pupae and males decreased at 40 mg/kg aspartame. Meanwhile, we found that aspartame toxicity can cause weight and morphological changes. These changes may be related to the abnormal gene expression of Ecdysone receptor, Tailless and Extradenticle of P. vicina (PvEcR, PvTll and PvExd) resulting from aspartame treatment.

Methods: Eight college-aged, healthy males completed three randomly assigned trials, which consisted of a mixed macronutrient meal test with 20oz of Diet-Coke (AS), Coca-Cola (NS), or water (CON). One week separated each trial and each participant served as his own control. Resting energy expenditure (REE) via indirect calorimetry, blood pressure, and blood samples were obtained immediately before, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after meal and beverage ingestion. A two-way (treatment × time) repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to assess REE, fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates, blood glucose, and plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations. Results: There was a significant main effect of treatment on total fat oxidation (P = 0.006), fat oxidation was significantly higher after AS (P = 0.006) and CON (P = 0.001) compared to following NS. There was a significant main effect of treatment on total carbohydrate oxidation (P = 0.005), carbohydrate oxidation was significantly lower after AS (P = 0.014) and CON (P = 0.001) compared to following NS. Plasma insulin concentration AUC was significantly lower after AS (P = 0.019) and trended lower in CON (P = 0.054) compared to following NS.

Thus, the current study investigated if the combined administration of ASP and AFB1 would impair hepatic and renal oxidative status. Male Wistar rats received during 14 days once a day ASP (75 mg/Kg) and/or AFB1 (250 µg/Kg) through intragastric route. At the end of experimental protocol, samples of liver and kidneys were collected for assessing biochemical markers of oxidative status. In the hepatic tissue, the treatment with a single substance (ASP or AFB1) caused an increase in TBARS levels, and a reduction in non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses (Vit C and NPSH levels and FRAP test). In the kidneys, TBARS levels were increased only in the group that received ASP + AFB1. The association reduced NPSH content, while the treatment with AFB1 reduced the FRAP levels. GST and CAT activities were increased in all treatments. Overall, ASP and AFB1 association presented higher toxic effects to the tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the associated use of both ASP and AFB1 induces more extensive injuries in comparison to the effects caused by each one alone. Therefore, these data demonstrated that concomitant exposure to ASP and AFB1 potentiated their oxidative damage in hepatic tissue, suggesting that this organ is particularly sensitive to the toxic action induced by these substances.",

Although the negative impact of the disorder on overall quality of life has been well established, new treatments for AD are still needed. Various studies have reported on cannabidiol's effectiveness in relieving pain and easing inflammation while not presenting major health risks. AIMS: In this communication, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel cannabidiol (CBD) and aspartame formulation, JW-100, in relieving signs and symptoms of AD. PATIENTS/METHODS: We conducted a double-blinded placebo-controlled interventional study randomizing patients to one of three treatment groups: JW-100 (CBD plus aspartame), CBD only, or placebo topical formulations. The Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) score was used to document any changes in AD resulting from the applied interventions at 14 days. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients completed the trial and were included in the final analysis. The ISGA score of the patients at baseline was 2.56, 2.24, and 2.24, for the JW-100, CBD, and placebo groups, respectively. After two weeks of treatment, the ISGA score reduced by 1.28, 0.81, and 0.71, for the JW-100, CBD, and placebo groups, respectively. The JW-100 cohorts demonstrated statistically significant ISGA score reduction (p = 0.042). 50% of patients in the JW-100 group achieved ISGA score of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline after treatment (p = 0.028). Only 20% and 15% of patients in the CBD only and placebo groups reported ISGA score of clear or almost clear (0 or 1). CONCLUSIONS: JW-100, a novel topical formulation containing CBD and aspartame, was demonstrated to produce statistically significant improvements in AD following 14 days of topical application.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis therapy consists of inhibiting the osteoclasts' activity and promoting osteoblasts' osteogenesis. Salmon calcitonin (sCT) could realize both requirements, however, it is limited by the low bioavailability caused by fibrillation. Supramolecular assembly of sCT and biocompatible agents into nanoassemblies provides an opportunity to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, we used a facile method to fabricate salmon calcitonin-aspartame (sCT-APM) nanoassemblies. Supramolecular interactions could not only delay fibrillation time (from 36.9 h to 50.4 h), but also achieve sustained sCT release. Moreover, sCT-APM showed good biocompatibility and higher osteoinductive capacity than free sCT, revealing an osteogenesis improvement effect. Moreover, in vivo studies showed that sCT-APM has enhanced relative bioavailability (2.42-fold of sCT) and increased relative therapeutic efficacy (3.55-fold of sCT) through subcutaneous injection. These findings provide a convenient alternative strategy for osteoporosis therapy via supramolecular assemblies.",

The objective of this study was to examine whether two commonly used artificial sweeteners had an adverse effect on glucose control in normal-weight subjects, and in overweight and obese subjects when consumed for 2 weeks. In the study, 39 healthy subjects (body-mass index, kg/m2) (18-45) without Type 2 diabetes with an age of 18-75 years were randomly assigned to 0.6 L/day of an artificially sweetened soft drink containing acesulfame K (950) and aspartame (951) or 0.6 L/day of mineral water for 2 weeks each in a crossover study. There was a 4 week washout period with no drinks consumed. Glucose levels were read by a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) during each 2 week period. A 75 g oral glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at the beginning and end of each intervention period. Blood samples were collected at baseline, and 1 and 2 h for glucose and insulin. A 2 week intake of artificially sweetened beverage (ASB) did not alter concentrations of fasting glucose and fasting insulin, the area under the curve (AUC) for OGTT glucose and insulin, the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for OGTT glucose and insulin, the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and the Matsuda index compared with the baseline and with the changes after a 2 week intake of mineral water. Continuous 2 week glucose concentrations were not significantly different after a 2 week intake of ASB compared with a 2 week intake of mineral water. This study found no harmful effect of the artificially sweetened soft drink containing acesulfame K (950) and aspartame (951) on glucose control when consumed for 2 weeks by people without Type 2 diabetes.",

Seventeen healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 45 years who had a body mass index (BMI) of 20-25 were selected. They undertook two 14-day treatment periods separated by a four-week washout period. The sweeteners consumed by each participant consisted of a standardized dose of 14% (0.425 g) of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for aspartame and 20% (0.136 g) of the ADI for sucralose. Faecal samples collected before and after treatments were analysed for microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). There were no differences in the median relative proportions of the most abundant bacterial taxa (family and genus) before and after treatments with both NNSs. The microbiota community structure also did not show any obvious differences. There were no differences in faecal SCFAs following the consumption of the NNSs. These findings suggest that daily repeated consumption of pure aspartame or sucralose in doses reflective of typical high consumption have minimal effect on gut microbiota composition or SCFA production.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to investigate the antihyperglycemic potential of miracle fruit (MF) as well as its hepatic safety as compared to aspartame in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. METHODS: MF extracts were prepared and screened for their phytochemical composition using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents and antioxidant potential were also determined. Additionally, MF was evaluated for its sensory attributes. For in vivo work, MF ethanol extract at high (MFH: 500 mg/kg body weight [BW]) and low (MFL: 250 mg/kg BW) doses as well as aspartame were injected intraperitoneally into alloxan-induced diabetic mice. Blood glucose levels were determined following acute and subchronic treatment. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed, serum was collected for biochemical analysis and liver tissues were obtained for histopathological examination. RESULTS: MF ethanol extract contained more flavonoids and tannins, and had higher 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity (79.61%) compared to MF aqueous extract (P < 0.05). HPLC analysis of MF ethanol extract also revealed the presence of 10 antioxidants with quercetin comprising the major polyphenol. Additionally, sensory analysis of MF showed that its intake is effective in masking undesirable sourness. Subchronic administration of MFH proved amelioration of hyperglycemia in mice as compared to aspartame. Moreover, aspartame treatment significantly elevated (P < 0.05) the level of alanine aminotransferase and had destructive effects on the liver histopathology; however, hepatic architecture was restored by low and high doses of MF. CONCLUSION: MF is an effective antihyperglycemic with hepatoprotective properties that can be used as a healthier alternative sweetening agent in place of aspartame for sour beverages.",

There are many debatable reports about aspartame toxicity in different tissues; however, on the subject of its effects on the reproductive system, few literatures are available. The present study was carried out for evaluating effects of aspartame on the reproductive system in male mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, a total of 36 adult male mice were randomly divided into four groups of nine animals each. Three groups received aspartame at doses of 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg (gavage) for 90 days; also, a control group was considered. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, animals were sacrificed. Then, body and testis weights, sperm parameters, serum testosterone concentration, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)] activities in blood, histomorphometrical indices and histochemical changes in testis were evaluated; also, mRNA and immunohistochemical expression of Hsp70-2 was measured in testis tissue. RESULTS: The results revealed remarkable differences in sperm parameters, testosterone and oxidative stress biomarkers levels, and histomorphometrical indices, between the control and treatment groups. Also, in 80 and 160 mg/kg aspartametreated groups, expression of Hsp70-2 was decreased. Besides, in the aspartame receiving groups, some histochemical changes in testicular tissue were observed. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study elucidated that long-term consumption of aspartame resulted in reproductive damages in male mice through induction of oxidative stress."

In order to differentiate between tumours and immune cell infiltrates, updated pathological criteria and nomenclature were used and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was applied to haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumours (HLTs) in the original prenatal long-term Aspartame (APM) study performed by the Ramazzini Institute (RI). All 78 cases of HLTs from treated and control groups were re-examined based on light microscopic morphological characteristics and subjected to a panel of IHC markers including Ki67, CD3, PAX5, CD20, CD68, TdT, CD45, CD14 and CD33. The analysis confirmed the diagnoses of HLTs in 72 cases, identified 3 cases of preneoplastic lesions (lymphoid hyperplasia), and categorized 3 cases as inflammatory lesions. A statistically significant increase in total HLTs (p = 0.006), total lymphomas (p = 0.032) and total leukaemias (p = 0.031) in treated female rats was confirmed (high dose vs control), and a statistically significant linear trend for each HLT type was also observed. After the HLT cases re-evaluation, the results obtained are consistent with those reported in the previous RI publication and reinforce the hypothesis that APM has a leukaemogenic and lymphomatogenic effect.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that aspartame supplementation in starter diet accelerates small intestinal cell cycle by stimulating secretion and expression of glucagon-like peptide -2 (GLP-2) in pre-weaned lambs using animal and cell culture experiments. In vivo, twelve 14-day-old lambs were selected and allocated randomly to two groups; one was treated with plain starter diet (Con, n = 6) and the other was treated with starter supplemented with 200 mg of aspartame/kg starter (APM, n = 6). Results showed that the lambs received APM treatment for 35 d had higher (p < .05) GLP-2 concentration in the plasma and greater jejunum weight/live body weight (BW) and jejunal crypt depth. Furthermore, APM treatment significantly upregulated (p < .05) the mRNA expression of cyclin D1 in duodenum; and cyclin A2, cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinases 6 (CDK6) in jejunum; and cyclin A2, cyclin D1, CDK4 in ileum. Moreover, APM treatment increased (p < .05) the mRNA expression of glucagon (GCG), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in the jejunum and ileum and mRNA expression of GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) in the jejunum. In vitro, when jejunal cells were treated with GLP-2 for 2 hr, the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) OD, IGF-1 concentration, and the mRNA expression of IGF-1, cyclin D1 and CDK6 were increased (p < .05). Furthermore, IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitor decreased (p < .05) the mRNA expression of IGF-1, cyclin A2, cyclin D1 and CDK6 in GLP-2 treatment jejunal cells. These results suggest that aspartame supplementation in starter accelerates small intestinal cell cycle that may, in part, be related to stimulate secretion and expression of GLP-2 in pre-weaning lambs. Furthermore, GLP-2 can indirectly promote the proliferation of jejunal cells mainly through the IGF-1 pathway. These findings provide new insights into nutritional interventions that promote the development of small intestines in young ruminants.",

      "abstract": "Background Aspartame (ASP) is used for treatment of obesity and diabetes mellitus. This study was designed to illustrate the biochemical responses and histopathological alterations besides the genotoxicity of ASP alone or with l-carnitine (LC) in the liver of rats. Methods Animals were separated into six groups: control, lower dose of ASP (ASP-LD; 75 mg/kg), higher dose of ASP (ASP-HD; 150 mg/kg), l-carnitine (LC; 10 mg/kg), ASP-LD plus LC, and ASP-HD plus LC. Treatment was carried out orally for 30 consecutive days. Results ASP raised the activity of some enzymes of liver markers and disturbed the lipid profile levels. The hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, the marker enzymes of antioxidant activities, were obviously diminished, and, possibly, the lipid peroxidation, C-reactive protein, and interleukins levels were increased. ASP significantly increased the DNA deterioration in comparison with the control in a dose-dependent manner. LC prevented ASP-induced liver damage as demonstrated by the enhancement of all the above parameters. Results of histopathological and electron microscopic examination proved the biochemical feedback and the improved LC effect on liver toxicity. Conclusions The co-treatment of LC showed different improvement mechanisms against ASP-induced liver impairment. So, the intake of ASP should be regulated and taken with LC when it is consumed in different foods or drinks to decrease its oxidative stress, histopathology, and genotoxicity of liver.",

Other carcinogenicity studies conducted on aspartame have shown no such carcinogenic potential in any organ system. Additional data to assess the carcinogenic potential of aspartame, especially in relation to the publications of the Ramazzini Institute, were obtained from a third-party histological evaluation of tissues from a carcinogenicity study previously conducted to assess the potential for aspartame to induce tumors of the brain. The results of this histological evaluation provide no evidence of a tumorigenic effect of aspartame in any organ group, including those organs/tissues reportedly affected in the Ramazzini Institute's studies. The only effects identified were an increased incidence of renal pelvic mineralization and renal pelvic hyperplasia secondary to the irritant properties of the mineralization process. The toxicological significance of these particular findings is widely considered minimal. There is no evidence that aspartame is carcinogenic in rats, at least to doses of 4 g/kg body weight/day administered over a 2-year period.",

This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of aspartame, with or without associated early nutritional deficiency, on behavioral parameters suggestive of anxiety and electrophysiological features of the excitability-related phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression (CSD). Newborn Wistar rats (n = 80) were suckled under favorable (L9; n = 40) or unfavorable lactation conditions (L15; n = 40), consisting of litters with 9 or 15 pups, respectively. In each lactation condition, animals were divided into 4 groups that received per gavage, from postnatal day 8 to 28, 75 mg/kg/d or 125 mg/kg/d aspartame (groups ASP75 and ASP125), or water (vehicle group), or no treatment (naive group). Behavioral tests (elevated plus-maze [EPM]) were performed at postnatal days 86-95 and CSD was recorded between postnatal days 96-115. Compared to the control groups, aspartame dose-dependently reduced body weight, suggesting a negative impact on animal development; aspartame also caused behavioral changes suggestive of anxiety (shorter stay in the open arms in the EPM) and decelerated CSD (lower propagation speed). Some of these parameters were more affected in L15 animals, suggesting an interaction among aspartame and lactation condition. We concluded that early consumption of aspartame adversely affects development of the organism (weight loss), with actions on behavioral (anxiety-like) and cerebral electrophysiological (CSD) parameters. The data suggest caution in aspartame consumption by lactating mothers and their infants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-calorie sweeteners are often used to moderate energy intake and postprandial glycemia, but some evidence indicates that they may exacerbate these aims. OBJECTIVE: The trial's primary aim was to assess the effect of daily aspartame ingestion for 12 wk on glycemia. Effects on appetite and body weight were secondary aims. METHODS: One hundred lean [body mass index (kg/m2): 18-25] adults aged 18-60 y were randomly assigned to consume 0, 350, or 1050 mg aspartame/d (ASP groups) in a beverage for 12 wk in a parallel-arm design. At baseline, body weight and composition were determined, a 240-min oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) was administered, and measurements were made of appetite and selected hormones. Participants also collected a 24-h urine sample. During the intervention, the 0-mg/d ASP group consumed capsules containing 680 mg dextrose and 80 mg para-amino benzoic acid. For the 350-mg/d ASP group, the beverage contained 350 mg aspartame and the 1050-mg/d ASP group consumed the same beverage plus capsules containing 680 mg dextrose and 700 mg aspartame. Body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and waist circumference were measured weekly. At weeks 4, 8, and 12, participants collected 24-h urine samples and kept appetite logs. Baseline measurements were repeated at week 12. RESULTS: With the exception of the baseline OGTT glucose concentration at 60 min (and resulting area under the curve value), there were no group differences for glucose, insulin, resting leptin, glucagon-like peptide 1, or gastric inhibitory peptide at baseline or week 12. There also were no effects of aspartame ingestion on appetite, body weight, or body composition. Compliance with the beverage intervention was ∼95%. CONCLUSIONS: Aspartame ingested at 2 doses for 12 wk had no effect on glycemia, appetite, or body weight among healthy, lean adults. These data do not support the view that aspartame is problematic for the management of glycemia, appetite, or body weight. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02999321.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Aspartame (L-aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester) is a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) approved for use in more than 6000 dietary products and pharmaceuticals consumed by the general public including adults and children, pregnant and nursing mothers. However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing in utero may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis. RESULTS: Using 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism. CONCLUSION: ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.",

Forty adult rats were divided into four equal groups: Group I, received appropriate vehicle only and served as control. Group II, received oral doses of both NAC (600 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)) and FA (12 mg/kg b.w.) daily for 42 days. Group III, received oral doses of ASP (500 mg/kg b.w.) daily for 42 days. Group IV, received both NAC and FA, concurrently with ASP at the same doses, route and period of administration of the previous groups. Histological examination of the cerebral cortex of ASP-treated rats showed severe degenerative changes, especially in the nerve cells. Some of these cells appeared shrunken, irregular in shape, while the others appeared swollen and were surrounded by pericellular halos. Immunohistochemical and morphometric study of ASP-treated group revealed a weak B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) immunoexpression in the cytoplasm of many cells, while intense positive immunoreaction for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was observed in the cytoplasm and processes of astrocytes compared to control group with statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). Light microscopic results were confirmed by ultrastructural findings. However, NAC and FA in combination had an obvious protective effect against ASP-induced injury in the rat's cerebral cortex. In conclusion, these results suggested that NAC combined with FA can ameliorate the toxic effect of ASP on the rat's cerebral cortex.",

The rats were divided into seven groups, including distilled water, corn oil, vitamin E (100mg/kg/day), and low (acceptable daily dose) and high doses of aspartame (40 and 200mg/kg/day) respectively, with or without vitamin E consumption, for 8 weeks. Behavioral tests were recorded and the brain was prepared for stereological assessments. Novel objects test and eight-arm radial maze showed impairmentoflong- and short-termmemoriesin aspartame groups. Besides, mPFC volume, infralimbic volume, neurons number, glial cells number, dendrites length per neuron,and number of spines per dendrite length were decreased by 7-61% in the rats treated with aspartame. However, neurons' number, glial cells number, and rats' performance in eight-arm radial mazes were improved by concomitant consumption of vitamin E and aspartame. Yet, the mPFC volume and infralimbic cortex were protected only in the rats receiving the low dose of aspartame+vitamin E. On the other hand, dendrites length, spines number,and novel object recognition were not protected by treatment with vitamin E+aspartame. The acceptable daily dose or higher doses of aspartame could induce memory impairments and cortical cells loss in mPFC. However, vitamin E could ameliorate some of these changes.",

      "abstract": "Aspartame is widely used artificial sweeteners as food additives. Several researchers have pointed that the controversial report on the use of aspartame over more than decades. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential and unsaturated fatty acids, and it plays a remarkable role in vision, intelligence, neural development, and metabolism of neurotransmitters. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on aspartame treated renal cells. Experimental groups were divided into three such as sham control, aspartame treated, and aspartame with omega-3 fatty acids. Cell viability was determined by sulforhodamine-b assay and flow cytometric analysis. The experimental results showed that the aspartame induced altered cell viability were reduced following treatment of aspartame with omega-3 fatty acids. Altered cell morphology was recovered by omega-3 fatty acids. DNA damage appeared in the highest concentration of aspartame used in this study. DNA damage characteristics such as comet tail and tiny head sections did not appear in the omega-3 fatty acids treated cells. Several microvilli and vesicular structures were found in aspartame treated cells. Altered morphology such as rounding, microvilli, and formation of dome-like structures did not appear in the omega-3 fatty acids with aspartame treated cells. Caspase-3 mRNA and protein expression were increased in aspartame treated cells, and these levels were reduced following omega-3 fatty acids treatment. Taking all these data together, it is suggested that the omega-3 fatty acids may be a therapeutic agent to reduce the aspartame induced biochemical and morphological alterations in normal renal cells. © 2017 BioFactors, 43(6):847-857, 2017.",

Nevertheless, many genetic and environmental factors as well as the neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to the development of these disorders are not fully understood. Similarly, evidence about the long-term metabolic effects of exposure to sweeteners in early life is limited and inconsistent. This study used an animal model of maternal separation during breastfeeding (MS) to analyze the effects of early life stress on consumption of sweeteners, weight gain, blood glucose and locomotion. Rats were housed under a reversed light/dark cycle (lights off at 7:00 h) with ad libitum access to water and food. In the MS protocol, MS pups were separated from the dam for 6 h per day in two periods of 180 minutes (7:00-10:00 and 13:00-16:00 h) during the dark phase of postnatal day (PND) 1 to PND 21. Non-separated (NS) pups served as controls. On PND 22 rats were grouped by sex and treatment. From PND 26 to PND 50 sucrose and aspartame were provided to rats, and sweetener intake, body weight and blood glucose-related measures were scored. On PND 50, both male and female rats were exposed to the open field test to obtain locomotion and anxiety-related measures. Results showed that both early maternal separation and sweetener intake during adolescence resulted in increased blood glucose and hyperactivity in male rats but not in female rats. Data suggest that the combination of early stress and exposure to sucrose and aspartame could be a risk factor for the development of chronic diseases such as diabetes, as well as for behavioral alterations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Type II Diabetes (T2D) have to manage blood glucose levels to sustain health and longevity. Artificial sweeteners (including aspartame) are suggested sugar alternatives for these individuals. The safety of aspartame in particular, has long been the centre of debate. Although it is such a controversial product, many clinicians recommend its use to T2D patients, during a controlled diet and as part of an intervention strategy. Aspartame is 200 times sweeter than sugar and has a negligible effect on blood glucose levels, and it is suggested for use so that T2D can control carbohydrate intake and blood glucose levels. However, research suggests that aspartame intake may lead to an increased risk of weight gain rather than weight loss, and cause impaired blood glucose tolerance in T2D. OBJECTIVE: This review consolidates knowledge gained from studies that link aspartame consumption to the various mechanisms associated with T2D. METHOD: We review literature that provides evidence that raise concerns that aspartame may exacerbate T2D and add to the global burden of disease. RESULT: Aspartame may act as a chemical stressor by increasing cortisol levels, and may induce systemic oxidative stress by producing excess free radicals, and it may also alter gut microbial activity and interfere with the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, resulting in insulin deficiency or resistance. CONCLUSION: Aspartame and its metabolites are safe for T2D is still debatable due to a lack of consistent data. More research is required that provides evidence and raise concerns that aspartame may exacerbate prevalence of pathological physiology in the already stressed physiology of T2D.",

METHOD: Six groups of mice were administered vehicle (distilled water), silymarin (25mg/kg), aspartame (at 160 or 320mg/kg), and silymarin (25mg/kg) co-administered with aspartame at 160 or 320mg/kg daily for 21days, via an oral cannula. Behaviours were assessed after the first and last dose of treatment. Animals were sacrificed thereafter. Brain homogenates were used to assess antioxidant status; while sections of the cerebral cortex were processed for routine histology. RESULT: Repeated co-administration of silymarin with aspartame resulted in significant suppression of horizontal locomotion and rearing, while grooming behaviour was enhanced; when compared to aspartame alone. Spatial working-memory showed significant improvement only after acute co-administration, while anxiety-related behaviours were reduced after repeated administration of both silymarin and aspartame. Cerebral cortical morphological integrity was better preserved, and astrocytic reactivity reduced with silymarin co-administration. Brain activity of superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide levels were decreased, while glutathione peroxidase activity was increased, when compared to levels seen with aspartame alone. CONCLUSION: The study shows that co-administration of silymarin with aspartame was associated with significant attenuation of central effects, when compared to administration of aspartame alone."

Mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the presence of apoptotic and necrotic cells following aspartame treatment. Cell viability was significantly altered following a higher concentration of aspartame exposure. Mitochondria-derived ROS increased at higher concentrations of aspartame exposure. Exposure to 10 mM and 20 mM of aspartame induced DNA fragmentation. Apoptotic and necrotic bodies were found in the range of 1-20 mM aspartame exposure. Exposure to high concentrations of aspartame may alter cell viability and morphology, and it may induce ROS generation and DNA damage in cervical carcinoma cells."

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common multifactorial chronic skin disease that has a multiple and complex pathogenesis. AD is gradually increasing in prevalence globally. In NC/Nga mice, repetitive applications of 2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) evoke AD-like clinical symptoms similar to human AD. Aspartame (N-L-α-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester) is a methyl ester of a dipeptide, which is used as an artificial non-nutritive sweetener. Aspartame has analgesic and anti-inflammatory functions that are similar to the function of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin. We investigated whether aspartame can relieve AD-like clinical symptoms induced by DNFB treatment in NC/Nga mice. Sucrose did not relieve AD-like symptoms, whereas aspartame at doses of 0.5 μg kg(-1) and 0.5 mg kg(-1) inhibited ear swelling and relieved AD-like clinical symptoms. Aspartame inhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells including eosinophils, mast cells, and CD4(+) T cells, and suppressed the expression of cytokines including IL-4 and IFN-γ, and total serum IgE levels. Aspartame may have therapeutic value in the treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aspartame is a non-nutritive sweetener particularly used in 'diet' and 'low calorie' products and also in a variety of foods, drugs and hygiene products. Aspartame is metabolized by gut esterases and peptidases to three common chemicals: the amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, and small amounts of methanol. The aim of the present study was to assess potential changes in molecular mediators of aspartame as a chemical stressor in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of long-term administration of aspartame (40 mg/kg body weight/day) were tested in Wistar Albino rats. The treatment effects were assessed in different conditions, including control groups. After 90 days of treatment, circulating concentrations of different parameters were assessed: corticosterone, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant activity, nitric oxide, reduced glutathione and cytokines (interleukin 2, interleukin 4, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ). RESULTS: The results show that there was a significant increase in plasma corticosterone, serum lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide level along with a decrease in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant as well as significant decrease in interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ. There was also a significant increase in interleukin 4 irrespective of whether the animals were immunized or not. CONCLUSION: The findings clearly point out that aspartame acts as a chemical stressor because of increased corticosterone level and increased lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide level induce generation of free radicals in serum which may be the reason for variation of cytokine level and finally results in alteration of immune function. Aspartame metabolite methanol or formaldehyde may be the causative factors behind the changes observed.",

      "abstract": "Aspartame consumption is implicated in the development of obesity and metabolic disease despite the intention of limiting caloric intake. The mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear, but may involve circulating metabolites and the gut microbiota. Aims were to examine the impact of chronic low-dose aspartame consumption on anthropometric, metabolic and microbial parameters in a diet-induced obese model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into a standard chow diet (CH, 12% kcal fat) or high fat (HF, 60% kcal fat) and further into ad libitum water control (W) or low-dose aspartame (A, 5-7 mg/kg/d in drinking water) treatments for 8 week (n = 10-12 animals/treatment). Animals on aspartame consumed fewer calories, gained less weight and had a more favorable body composition when challenged with HF compared to animals consuming water. Despite this, aspartame elevated fasting glucose levels and an insulin tolerance test showed aspartame to impair insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in both CH and HF, independently of body composition. Fecal analysis of gut bacterial composition showed aspartame to increase total bacteria, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium leptum. An interaction between HF and aspartame was also observed for Roseburia ssp wherein HF-A was higher than HF-W (P<0.05). Within HF, aspartame attenuated the typical HF-induced increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio. Serum metabolomics analysis revealed aspartame to be rapidly metabolized and to be associated with elevations in the short chain fatty acid propionate, a bacterial end product and highly gluconeogenic substrate, potentially explaining its negative affects on insulin tolerance. How aspartame influences gut microbial composition and the implications of these changes on the development of metabolic disease require further investigation.",

There has been no information on the in vivo physiological effects of AS consumption in lipoprotein metabolism. High-dosage treatment (final 25, 50, and 100 mM) with AS (aspartame, acesulfame K, and saccharin) to human high-density lipoprotein (HDL) induced loss of antioxidant ability along with elevated atherogenic effects. Aspartame-treated HDL3 (final 100 mM) almost all disappeared due to putative proteolytic degradation. Aspartame- and saccharin-treated HDL3 showed more enhanced cholesteryl ester transfer activity, while their antioxidant ability was disappeared. Microinjection of the modified HDL3 exacerbated the inflammatory death in zebrafish embryos in the presence of oxLDL. These results show that AS treatment impaired the beneficial functions of HDL, resulting in loss of antioxidant and anti-atherogenic activities. These results suggest that aspartame and saccharin could be toxic to the human circulation system as well as embryonic development via impairment of lipoprotein function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Very low calorie diet (VLCD) is routinely used in programs for treatment of obesity and before bariatric surgery in order to reduce risk of postoperative complications. Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, is commonly used in VLCD and is well approved as a food additive without any adverse effects. The development of a new fructose containing VLCD formula without aspartame raises questions as to effects on glucose and lipid control. METHODS: As part of an ongoing study of a novel bariatric surgery procedure, twenty-five obese subjects with mean body mass index (BMI) 39.8 kg/m2 and mean age of 48.8 years enrolled in a single center observational study. Seven subjects presented with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The subjects underwent four weeks dietary treatment with VLCD Slanka (Slanka). Blood samples including fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol and triglycerides were performed at start and after four weeks of diet. Blood pressure and weight were noted. RESULTS: All subjects completed the diet without any adverse events. Mean weight reduction was 8.2 kg with 95% confidence interval 7.1-9.2 kg (p = 0.001). Excess weight (i.e. proportion of weight exceeding BMI 25) loss decreased by median 19.5% (inter quartile range (IQR) 16,8-24,2). Median fasting plasma glucose was at inclusion 5,6 mmol/l (IQR 5,3-6,8) and after diet 4.8 mmol/l (IQR 4,6-5,2) (p = 0.001). Median HbA1c changed from 39 mmol/mol (IQR 37-44) to 37 mmol/mol (IQR 35-43) (p = 0.001). There was also significant reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as in systolic blood pressure. Changes in other monitored blood chemistry values were without clinical importance. CONCLUSION: Four weeks treatment with fructose containing VLCD of obese subjects preparing for bariatric surgery gave a substantial weight reduction without any significant negative metabolic effects.",

Animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: untreated control, diabetic (D), D-insulin, D-aspartame, or the D-insulin + aspartame-treated group. Brain and liver tissue samples were used to analyze the activity of CYP2E1 and CYP3A2 and protein levels. Our results indicate that combined treatment with insulin and aspartame in juvenile diabetic rats significantly induced CYP2E1 in the cerebrum and cerebellum without modifying it in the liver, while CYP3A2 protein activity increased both in the brain and in the liver. The induction of CYP2E1 in the brain could have important in situ toxicological effects, given that this CYP isoform is capable of bioactivating various toxic substances. Additionally, CYP3A2 induction in the liver and brain could be considered a decisive factor in the variation of drug response and toxicity.",

N-Acetylcysteine provides the cysteine that is required for the production of GSH, being effective in treating disorders associated with oxidative stress. We investigated the effects of N-acetylcysteine treatment (150 mg kg(-1), i.p.) on oxidative stress biomarkers in rat brain after chronic aspartame administration by gavage (40 mg kg(-1)). N-Acetylcysteine led to a reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid hydroperoxides, and carbonyl protein levels, which were increased due to aspartame administration. N-Acetylcysteine also resulted in an elevation of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase activities, as well as non-protein thiols, and total reactive antioxidant potential levels, which were decreased after aspartame exposure. However, N-acetylcysteine was unable to reduce serum glucose levels, which were increased as a result of aspartame administration. Furthermore, catalase and glutathione S-transferase, whose activities were reduced due to aspartame treatment, remained decreased even after N-acetylcysteine exposure. In conclusion, N-acetylcysteine treatment may exert a protective effect against the oxidative damage in the brain, which was caused by the long-term consumption of the acceptable daily dose of aspartame by rats.",

Our results showed that aspartame at high dose caused a disturbance in ionic homeostasis and induced apoptosis in the brain. We also investigated the effects of aspartame on brain regional monoamine synthesis, and the results revealed that there was a significant decrease of dopamine in corpus striatum and cerebral cortex and of serotonin in corpus striatum. Moreover, aspartame treatment significantly alters the tyrosine hydroxylase activity and amino acids levels in the brain.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of repeated administration of aspartame in the working memory version of Morris water maze test, on oxidative stress and brain monoamines in brain of mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aspartame (0.625, 1.875 or 5.625 mg/kg) was administered once daily subcutaneously for 2 weeks and mice were examined four times a week for their ability to locate a submerged plate. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide levels (the concentrations of nitrite/nitrate) and glucose were determined in brain. RESULTS: Only at the highest dose of 5.625 mg/kg, did aspartame significantly impaired water maze performance. The mean time taken to find the escape platform (latency) over 2 weeks was significantly delayed by aspartame 5.625 mg/kg, compared with the saline-treated control group. Significant differences occurred only on the first trial to find the escape platform. Significant increase in brain MDA by 16.5% and nitric oxide by 16.2% and a decrease in GSH by 25.1% and glucose by 22.5% occurred after treatment with aspartame at 1.875 mg/kg. Aspartame administered at 5.625 mg/kg significantly increased brain MDA by 43.8%, nitric oxide by 18.6% and decreased GSH by 32.7% and glucose by 25.8%. Aspartame caused dose-dependent inhibition of brain serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest impaired memory performance and increased brain oxidative stress by repeated aspartame administration. The impaired memory performance is likely to involve increased oxidative stress as well as decreased brain glucose availability.",

In vitro and in vivo tests have reported contradictory data about APM genotoxicity. We evaluated the angiogenic effect of APM in an in vitro model using blood vessel development assay (Angio-Kit), cultured endothelial cells and fibroblasts. The release of IL-6, VEGF-A, and their soluble receptors sIL-R6 and sVEGFR-2 were determined over time in the conditioned medium of the Angio-Kit system, endothelial cells and cell lines with fibroblast properties after APM treatment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, cell viability, and stimulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk1/2) and protein p38 were also evaluated. Exposure to APM induced blood vessel formation. ROS production was observed in endothelial cells after APM treatment, which was associated with a slight cell cytotoxicity. Neither intracellular ROS formation nor cell death was observed in fibroblasts. APM increases the levels of inflammatory mediator IL-6, VEGF and their soluble receptors released from endothelial cells into the medium. APM treatment induces VEGF-pathway activation by erk1/2 and p38 phosphorylation. APM at low doses is an angiogenic agent that induces regenerative cytokine production leading to the activation of MAPKs and resulting in the formation of new blood vessels.",

Swiss Albino male mice were exposed to aspartame (3.5, 35, 350 mg/kg body weight). Bone marrow cells isolated from femora were analyzed for chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges. Treatment with aspartame induced dose dependently chromosome aberrations at all concentrations while it did not induce sister chromatid exchanges. On the other hand, aspartame did not decrease the mitotic index (MI). However, statistical analysis of the results show that aspartame is not significantly genotoxic at low concentration."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this second study is to better quantify the carcinogenic risk of APM, beginning treatment during fetal life. METHODS: We studied groups of 70-95 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats administered APM (2,000, 400, or 0 ppm) with feed from the 12th day of fetal life until natural death. RESULTS: Our results show a) a significant dose-related increase of malignant tumor-bearing animals in males (p < 0.01), particularly in the group treated with 2,000 ppm APM (p < 0.01); b) a significant increase in incidence of lymphomas/leukemias in males treated with 2,000 ppm (p < 0.05) and a significant dose-related increase in incidence of lymphomas/leukemias in females (p < 0.01), particularly in the 2,000-ppm group (p < 0.01); and c) a significant dose-related increase in incidence of mammary cancer in females (p < 0.05), particularly in the 2,000-ppm group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this carcinogenicity bioassay confirm and reinforce the first experimental demonstration of APM's multipotential carcinogenicity at a dose level close to the acceptable daily intake for humans. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that when life-span exposure to APM begins during fetal life, its carcinogenic effects are increased.",

      "abstract": "Aspartame (APM) is one of the most widely used artificial sweeteners in the world. Its ever-growing use in more than 6000 products, such as soft drinks, chewing gum, candy, desserts, etc., has been accompanied by rising consumer concerns regarding its safety, in particular its potential long-term carcinogenic effects. In light of the inadequacy of the carcinogenicity bioassays performed in the 1970s and 1980s, a long-term mega-experiment on APM was undertaken at the Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Center of the European Ramazzini Foundation on groups of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (100-150/sex/group), 8 weeks old at the start of the experiment. APM was administered in feed at concentrations of 100,000, 50,000, 10,000, 2,000, 400, 80, or 0 ppm. Treatment lasted until spontaneous death of the animals. The results of the study demonstrate that APM causes: (a) an increased incidence of malignant tumor-bearing animals, with a positive significant trend in both sexes, and in particular in females treated at 50,000 ppm (P < or = 0.01) when compared to controls; (b) an increase in lymphomas-leukemias, with a positive significant trend in both sexes, and in particular in females treated at doses of 100,000 (P < or = 0.01), 50,000 (P < or = 0.01), 10,000 (P < or = 0.05), 2000 (P < or = 0.05), and 400 ppm (P < or = 0.01); (c) a statistically significant increased incidence, with a positive significant trend, of transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter in females and particularly in those treated at 100,000 ppm (P < or = 0.05); and (d) an increased incidence of malignant schwannomas of the peripheral nerves, with a positive trend in males (P < or = 0.05). The results of this mega-experiment indicate that APM, in the tested experimental conditions, is a multipotential carcinogenic agent.",

Wistar rats were treated by gavage with ASP at daily doses of 75 and 125 mg/kg body weight for 30 days. Cerebrum and cerebellum were used to obtain microsomal fractions to analyse activity and protein levels of seven cytochrome P450 enzymes. Increases in activity were consistently found with the 75 mg/kg dose both in cerebrum and cerebellum for all seven enzymes, although not at the same levels: CYP 2E1-associated 4-nitrophenol hydroxylase (4-NPH) activity was increased 1.5-fold in cerebrum and 25-fold in cerebellum; likewise, CYP2B1-associated penthoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activity increased 2.9- and 1.7-fold respectively, CYP2B2-associated benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylase (BROD) 4.5- and 1.1-fold, CYP3A-associated erythromycin N-demethylase (END) 1.4- and 3.3-fold, CYP1A1-associated ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) 5.5- and 2.8-fold, and CYP1A2-associated methoxyresorufin O-demethylase (MROD) 3.7- and 1.3-fold. Furthermore, the pattern of induction of CYP immunoreactive proteins by ASP paralleled that of 4-NHP-, PROD-, BROD-, END-, EROD- and MROD-related activities only in the cerebellum. Conversely, no differences in CYP concentration and activity were detected in hepatic microsomes of treated animals with respect to the controls, suggesting a brain-specific response to ASP treatment.",

Verapamil (2, 3.5, 5, 7.5 mg/kg) induced significant (P < 0.01) antinociception in both phases of the formalin test. L-Nitro-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME) at the doses used, induced significant (P < 0.01) antinociception in early phase (1, 2, 5, 10 mg/kg) and late phase (5, 10 mg/kg). Twelve days of treatment in animals by aspartame (0.16% w/v) significantly induced antinociception in both phases of the formalin test. Both verapamil (5 mg/kg) and L-NAME (10 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.01) potentiated aspartame-induced antinociception in both phases of formalin test. The present findings support the hypothesis that the activation of NMDA receptors by aspartame modulates pain-related behaviour via a nitric oxide/cGMP/glutamate release cascade. It is concluded that aspartame would be a good analgesic agent if it would be used in combination with a calcium channel blocker or NOS inhibitor.",

Prior research demonstrated that aspartame can reduce second phase formalin pain and increase motor activity in arthritic patients. Fifty-eight male Sprague-Dawly rats were treated with aspartame (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) or saline for six days. An additional group of animals received daily injections of saline and on the sixth treatment day, received a 150-mg/kg dose of aspirin 30-minutes prior to behavioral testing. On Day 6, animals received an intra-articular (i.a.) injection of 2% lambda carrageenan (CARR) or an equal volume of saline and were tested four hours later on threshold to mechanical and thermal stimuli, open field activity, and knee joint diameter. Aspirin-treated arthritic animals exhibited significantly less mechanical hyperalgesia and knee joint inflammation compared with vehicle treated arthritic animals. However, aspirin did not reverse thermal hyperalgesia or increase motor activity to control levels. Aspartame did not reduce inflammation, increase motor activity, or attenuate thermal allodynia, but at 50 mg/kg did attenuate mechanical allodynia compared with vehicle treated arthritic animals. The anti-hyperalgesic effect on mechanical hyperalgesia was not seen at 25 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg aspartame. These results suggest that a certain amount of aspartame may provide relief of arthritic pain to a similar degree as aspirin in some individuals. The specific effect of aspartame and aspirin on mechanical hyperalgesia should be considered when these agents are used for the therapeutic treatment of arthritic conditions.",

The present study uses the novel technique of Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy equipped with differential scanning calorimetry (FT-IR/DSC microscopic system) to accelerate and determine simultaneously the thermal-dependent impurity formation of solid-state APM. The results indicate a dramatic change in IR spectra from 50, 110 or 153 degrees C, which was respectively attributed to the onset temperature of water evaporation, dehydration and cyclization processes. It is suggested that the processes of dehydration and intramolecular cyclization occurred in the solid-state APM during the heating process. As an impurity, 3-carboxymethyl-6-benzyl-2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) degraded from solid state APM via intramolecular cyclization and liberation of methanol. This was evidenced by this novel FT-IR/DSC microscopic system in a one-step procedure.",

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether aspartame can disrupt cognitive, neurophysiologic, or behavioral functioning in normal individuals. DESIGN: Forty-eight healthy volunteers completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The first month was aspartame free. Subjects then consumed sodas and capsules with placebo, aspartame, or sucrose for 20 d each. Order was randomized and subjects were assigned to either a high- (45 mg x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1)) or low- (15 mg x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1)) dose aspartame group. Neuropsychologic and laboratory testing was done on day 10 of each treatment period to determine possible acute effects and on day 20 for possible chronic effects. RESULTS: Plasma phenylalanine concentrations increased significantly during aspartame treatment. Neuropsychologic results; adverse experiences; amino acid, insulin, and glucose values; and electroencephalograms were compared by sex and by treatment. No significant differences were found for any dependent measure. CONCLUSION: Large daily doses of aspartame had no effect on neuropsychologic, neurophysiologic, or behavioral functioning in healthy young adults.",

      "abstract": "1. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by several fungi, especially Aspergillus and Penicillium species. Many food and foodstuffs can be contaminated by ochratoxin A, which is consequently found in blood of animals and humans. 2. The distribution into the brain of young adult rats fed OTA for 1 to 6 weeks and some consequences have been investigated in the present study. 3. Our results on rats given OTA (289 microg/kg/48 h) indicated that OTA accumulated in the whole brain as function of time according to a regression curve, Y=-8.723 a+16.72 with a correlation coefficient of r=0.989, where Y-axis is the OTA concentration in ng/g of brain and X-axis is the duration of the treatment in weeks. The brain OTA contents was 11.95 +/- 2.2, 23.89 +/- 4.4, 39.9 +/- 4.5, 50.3 +/- 7.3, 78.8 +/- 6.3, 94 +/- 16 ng/g of brain in the mycotoxin-treated animals for respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6-weeks treatment. OTA induced modifications of free amino-acid concentrations in the brain, mainly, Tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phe). Tyr decreased significantly as compared to control (p < 0.05). Phe increased significantly as compared to control (p < 0.05). 4. Aspartame, (25 mg/kg/48 h) a structural analogue of OTA largely modified the distribution and prevented the accumulation of OTA in the brain since the respective brain OTA contents decreased respectively to 9.6 +/- 7.9, 19.2 +/- 3.0, 26.8 +/- 4.2, 19.7 +/- 1.9, 13.7 /- 5.6 and 11.0 +/- 6.0 ng/g of tissue, for the same duration of treatment. It also prevented the modifications of Tyr and Phe levels. 5. The histological investigations showed several necrotic cells with pyknotic nucleus, detected in OTA treated animals with higher frequency as compared to the controls and Aspartame treated ones. Aspartame appeared to significantly prevent this nuclear effect as well, the meaning of which is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Adult male rats were given an oral dose of 10 mg/kg aspartame 14C-labelled in the methanol carbon. At timed intervals of up to 6 hours, the radioactivity in plasma and several organs was investigated. Most of the radioactivity found (>98% in plasma, >75% in liver) was bound to protein. Label present in liver, plasma and kidney was in the range of 1-2% of total radioactivity administered per g or mL, changing little with time. Other organs (brown and white adipose tissues, muscle, brain, cornea and retina) contained levels of label in the range of 1/12 to 1/10th of that of liver. In all, the rat retained, 6 hours after administration about 5% of the label, half of it in the liver. The specific radioactivity of tissue protein, RNA and DNA was quite uniform. The protein label was concentrated in amino acids, different from methionine, and largely coincident with the result of protein exposure to labelled formaldehyde. DNA radioactivity was essentially in a single different adduct base, different from the normal bases present in DNA. The nature of the tissue label accumulated was, thus, a direct consequence of formaldehyde binding to tissue structures. The administration of labelled aspartame to a group of cirrhotic rats resulted in comparable label retention by tissue components, which suggests that liver function (or its defect) has little effect on formaldehyde formation from aspartame and binding to biological components. The chronic treatment of a series of rats with 200 mg/kg of non-labelled aspartame during 10 days resulted in the accumulation of even more label when given the radioactive bolus, suggesting that the amount of formaldehyde adducts coming from aspartame in tissue proteins and nucleic acids may be cumulative. It is concluded that aspartame consumption may constitute a hazard because of its contribution to the formation of formaldehyde adducts.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The binding of sweet-tasting compounds in a human (Mcg) Bence-Jones dimer has been characterized by x-ray crystallography. Aspartame binding in this immunoglobulin fragment is remarkable. Unexpected pain relief noted by A.B.E., a crystallographer with diagnosed osteoarthritis, suggested that the accommodation of aspartame in the active site of the dimer may represent surrogate binding by other proteins, with analgesia as the outcome. METHODS: X-ray analysis of the complex of aspartame and the Bence-Jones dimer was conducted with crystalline Mcg protein and pure aspartame. A single-blind (n = 1) study to confirm analgesia was completed by administration of aspartame to A.B.E. A controlled double-blind trial was performed in patients with x-ray-documented osteoarthritis. Pain and performance changes were evaluated with use of two doses of placebo and two doses of aspartame. Effects on bleeding time were then evaluated by determination of template bleeding times in 34 normal volunteers. Finally, antipyretic effects were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats given intramuscular turpentine injections. RESULTS: Aspartame binding in the Bence-Jones dimer was verified by x-ray crystallography. Improvements in performance and pain relief were observed in A.B.E. at p < 0.001. Decreased pain and improved performance were also observed in patients with osteoarthritis (p < 0.001). Mild antihemostatic responses were observed in bleeding times after aspartame treatment. Modified template bleeding times increased at p < 0.01. Aspartame blocked the turpentine-mediated febrile responses in the treated rats (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: L-Aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester is biologically active and appears to relieve pain, induce mild antithrombotic effects in humans, and decrease fever in animals.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated whether the addition of the high-intensity sweetener aspartame to a multidisciplinary weight-control program would improve weight loss and long-term control of body weight. One hundred sixty-three obese women were randomly assigned to consume or to abstain from aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages during 16 wk of a 19-wk weight-reduction program (active weight loss), a 1-y maintenance program, and a 2-y follow-up period. Women in both treatment groups lost approximately 10% of initial body weight (10 kg) during active weight loss. Among women assigned to the aspartame-treatment group, aspartame intake was positively correlated with percentage weight loss during active weight loss (r = 0.32, P < 0.01). During maintenance and follow-up, participants in the aspartame group experienced a 2.6% (2.6 kg) and 4.6% (4.6 kg) regain of initial body weight after 71 and 175 wk, respectively, whereas those in the no-aspartame group gained an average of 5.4% (5.4 kg) and 9.4% (9.4 kg), respectively. The aspartame group lost significantly more weight overall (P = 0.028) and regained significantly less weight during maintenance and follow-up (P = 0.046) than did the no-aspartame group. Percentage weight losses at 71 and 175 wk were also positively correlated with exercise (r = 0.32, P < 0.001; and r = 0.34, P < 0.01, respectively) and self-reported eating control (r = 0.37, P < 0.001; and r = 0.33, P < 0.01, respectively). These data suggest that participation in a multidisciplinary weight-control program that includes aspartame may facilitate the long-term maintenance of reduced body weight.",

Each experimental period was 7 days long. Subjects reported headaches on 33% of the days during aspartame treatment, compared with 24% on placebo treatment (p = 0.04). Subjects who were \"very sure\" prior to the study that aspartame triggered some of their headaches reported larger treatment differences (aspartame = 0.37 headache-days, placebo = 0.18 headache-days; p < 0.001) than subjects who were \"somewhat sure\" (aspartame = 0.29 headache-days, placebo = 0.22 headache-days; p = 0.51) or \"not sure\" (aspartame = 0.33 headache-days, placebo = 0.39 headache-days; p = 0.51). There was no significant treatment difference in the length or intensity of headaches or in the occurrence of side effects associated with the headaches. This experiment provides evidence that, among individuals with self-reported headaches after ingestion of aspartame, a subset of this group report more headaches when tested under controlled conditions. It appears that some people are particularly susceptible to headaches caused by aspartame and may want to limit their consumption.",

This is confirmed by a reanalysis of the raw data (available from a Ph.D. thesis: Ryan-Harshman, 1987) that can be interpreted as showing a dose-related suppression of food intake by phenylalanine. Furthermore, the data are consistent with an anorexic action of aspartame and perhaps also of alanine (which was designated as the placebo treatment by Ryan-Harshman et al.). These, together with other findings, suggest that the appetite effects of amino acids and small peptides should be investigated further. In addition to its theoretical importance, such work may have potential for therapeutic applications.",

Upon ingestion, aspartame is completely metabolized to two amino acids and methanol (approximately 50% phenylalanine, 40% aspartic acid, and 10% methanol). The effects of aspartame on cognitive function, electroencephalograms (EEGs) and biochemical parameters were evaluated in 48 adult (21 men, 27 women) heterozygotes for phenylketonuria (PKUH), PKUH subjects whose carrier status had been proven by DNA analysis ingested aspartame (either 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) and placebo for 12 weeks on each treatment using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. A computerized battery of neuropsychological tests was administered at baseline weeks -2 and -1, and during treatment at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. Samples for plasma amino acids and urinary organic acids were also collected during these visits. EEGs were evaluated by conventional and spectral analysis at baseline week -1 and treatment weeks 12 and 24. The results of the neuropsychological tests demonstrated that aspartame had no effect on cognitive function. Plasma phenylalanine significantly increased, within the normal range for PKUH, at 1 and 3 h following the morning dose of aspartame in the group receiving the 45 mg/kg per day dose only. There were no significant differences in the conventional or spectral EEG analyses, urinary organic acid concentrations, and adverse experiences when aspartame was compared with placebo. This study reaffirms the safety of aspartame in PKUH and refutes the speculation that aspartame affects cognitive performance, EEGs, and urinary organic acids.",

We report on 10 children (5 boys, 5 girls, ages 5-13 yr) who were tested for 2 weeks each on APM and placebo (single morning dose, 34 mg/kg). Seven children had generalized convulsions with 4 also having absence episodes. One child had absence seizures and 2 had complex partial seizures only. On each arm of the study, children were admitted to the hospital for a standard 21-lead electroencephalogram (EEG), continuous 24-hour cassette EEG, and determination of biochemical variables in plasma and urine. Subjects completed the Subjects Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (STESS) and parents the Conners Behavior Rating Scale. There were no significant differences between APM and placebo in the standard EEG or 24-hour EEG. No differences were noted for the STESS or the Conners ratings, and no differences were noted for any of the biochemical measures (except for expected increases in phenylalanine and tyrosine after APM). Our findings indicate that, in this group of vulnerable children, APM does not provoke seizures.",

DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of unmedicated children meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed) criteria for attention deficit disorder. SETTING: Behavioral assessments were performed in the child's home by their parents and in the classroom by a teacher. Cognitive tests were administered and blood drawing was performed during a 2-day inpatient admission to our Children's Study Center. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of aspartame (single morning dose, 34 mg/kg) or placebo for alternate 2-week periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioral and cognitive tests included the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT), Children's Checking Task (CCT), the Airplane Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Subjects Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (STESS), the Multigrade Inventory for Teachers (MIT), and the Conners Behavior Rating Scale. Blood was drawn for complete blood cell count and liver function tests, as well as amino acid, methanol, formate, serotonin, and monoamine metabolite analyses, and urine was collected for measurement of catecholamine and monoamine metabolite excretion. RESULTS: No clinically significant differences between aspartame and placebo were found for the STESS, MIT, or Conners ratings, or for the MFFT, CCT, WCST, or Airplane cognition tests. Also, no differences were noted for any of the biochemical measures, except for the expected increase in plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine following aspartame. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that aspartame at greater than 10 times usual consumption has no effect on the cognitive and behavioral status of children with attention deficit disorder. In addition, aspartame does not appear to affect urinary excretion rates of monoamines and metabolites.",

The present study examined this appetite reduction to determine its cause. Eighteen normal weight young adult males received five treatments (beverage preloads) at 1100 h in a randomized order, one per week: 280 ml of carbonated mineral water (CMW) (control), 560 ml of CMW, 280 ml of CMW with 340 mg of encapsulated APM, 280 ml of CMW sweetened with 340 mg APM, 560 ml of an APM-sweetened soft drink (340 mg APM). Subjective hunger and food appeal were measured from 0930 a.m. to 1230 h, and food intake from a buffet lunch offered at 1205 h was measured. Treatment had no effect on food intake or macronutrient selection. Both 560 ml of CMW or soft drink suppressed appetite, although 280 ml of APM-sweetened mineral water significantly increased subjective appetite relative to the control. Encapsulated APM had no effect on appetite. Therefore, appetite reduction following consumption of an APM-sweetened drink is likely due to drink volume and not the APM content. In addition, consuming APM-sweetened CMW produces a short-term increase in subjective appetite.",

There are, however, little scientific data concerning the effect of aspartame upon complex mental operations such as those necessary for flying an aircraft. Thirteen pilots were tested in a double-blind study using the SPARTANS cognitive test battery of aviation-relevant information-processing tasks. These tasks relate to perceptual-motor abilities, spatial abilities, working memory, attentional performance, risk taking, processing flexibility, planning and sequencing ability. Subjects were tested over five sessions consisting of pretest and posttest controls and three randomly ordered treatment sessions. The treatment conditions involved an aspartame dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, a placebo condition, and an ethyl alcohol (0.1% BAL) condition as the positive control. No detectable performance decrements were associated with the aspartame condition, although decrements in psychomotor and spatial abilities were detected in the ethanol condition. Results were found to be consistent with prior flight-simulator studies of alcohol, but do not appear to support the concerns expressed in anecdotal testimony regarding the deleterious effects of aspartame upon cognitive performance.",

This study examined the effects of familiar carbonated soft drinks sweetened with aspartame on subjective hunger, energy intake and macronutrient selection at a lunch-time meal. Subjects were 20 normal weight young adult males, classified as either restrained or nonrestrained eaters. Four treatments of carbonated beverages included 280 ml of mineral water, one can of a soft drink (280 ml) consumed in either 2 or 10 minutes, or two cans of a soft drink (560 ml) consumed in 10 minutes, administered at 11:00 a.m. Subjective hunger and food appeal were measured from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and food intake data were obtained from a buffet lunch given at 12:00 noon. There were no treatment effects on energy intake, macronutrient selection or food choice at the lunch-time meal, or food appeal, though restrained eaters consumed more than nonrestrained eaters in all four treatment conditions. Consumption of two soft drinks (560 ml, 320 mg aspartame) significantly reduced subjective hunger from 11:05 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. compared to one soft drink (280 ml, 160 mg aspartame) or 280 ml of mineral water. Thus ingestion of soft drinks containing aspartame did not increase short-term subjective hunger or food intake.",

      "abstract": "It was reported previously that the dipeptide sweetener aspartame suppresses food intake in humans by a postingestive action. The present study examined the hypothesis that this is due to an effect of phenylalanine, one of the primary breakdown products of aspartame (phenylalanine is a potent releaser of the so-called satiety hormone cholecystokinin, CCK). Capsulated aspartame (400 mg) administered to human volunteers reduced food intake by 15% (253 kcal) in a lunchtime test meal begun 1 hour later. However, neither phenylalanine (200 mg) nor the other constituent amino acid of aspartame, aspartic acid (200 mg), altered intake compared with placebo. Despite the large effect on food intake there were no treatment differences in pre- or postmeal ratings of motivation to eat. This suggests that aspartame may act to intensify the satiating effects of ingested food. Although high doses of phenylalanine reduce food intake, an individual action of phenylalanine cannot account for the potent anorexic effect of aspartame. In discussing alternative mechanisms it is noted that the amino acid sequence of aspartame (Asp-Phe) is the same as the C-terminal dipeptide of CCK. A direct action of aspartame at CCK receptors appears to be unlikely; however, aspartame might act as CCK releaser. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of aspartame's anorexic action and perhaps to evaluate its therapeutic potential as an antiobesity agent.",

Rats were included as known positive controls. Plasma and brain levels of phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) were measured in CD1 mice and guinea-pigs at various intervals after a dose of 1 g APM/kg body weight (administered orally to mice and ip to guinea-pigs). In mice, peak levels of Phe and Tyr were observed in plasma after 30 min and in brain after 60 min. In guinea-pigs peak plasma levels of Phe and Tyr occurred 30 min after treatment. Phe was at a maximum in guinea-pig brain after 30 min, while Tyr levels reached a peak at 120 min. In further experiments Phe and Tyr levels were measured 1 hr after APM doses of 0.5, 0.75 or 1 g/kg. In CD1 mice, plasma Phe and Tyr levels were increased significantly only at the highest dose, whereas in brain, Tyr concentrations were significantly increased by 0.75 or 1 g APM/kg and Phe was significantly increased by all three doses. In the guinea-pig, plasma Phe and Tyr were increased significantly only by 1 g APM/kg and in brain this dose significantly raised only the Phe levels. Monoamine and metabolite levels were determined in the brain striata of CD1 and DBA/2J mice 1 hr after the oral administration of 1 or 2 g APM/kg body weight; no differences from control values were found in either strain. The studies of potentiation of metrazol-induced convulsions showed that APM, at doses of up to 2 g/kg body weight, had no such effect in mice or guinea-pigs. In contrast, as expected, the potentiation was significant in the rat at 1 g/kg.",

Twenty healthy subjects received a single 20 mg/kg dose of aspartame in capsules or solution in a randomized, crossover design. Plasma amino acid concentrations and the phenylalanine to large neutral amino acid ratios (Phe/LNAA) were determined. Plasma aspartate concentrations did not increase with either treatment. For plasma phenylalanine following capsule ingestion, there was a smaller peak plasma concentration (Cmax; 103.3 v 126.6 mumol/L), a longer time to peak concentration (tmax; 108.6 v 36.6 minutes), but no significant difference in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) (7,656 v 7,200 mumol.min/L) when compared with solution ingestion. The maximum plasma Phe/LNAA ratio was smaller (0.16 v 0.19) with capsules. The changes for plasma tyrosine were similar to those seen with phenylalanine. There were no significant differences in the plasma concentrations of the other LNAAs between capsule and solution ingestion. Thus, given the small effect on phenylalanine Cmax and Phe/LNAA and no effect on the extent of absorption of phenylalanine, aspartame ingested in capsules at doses up to 20 mg/kg is a suitable dosage form for blinded clinical studies, provided that the slower rate of absorption of phenylalanine from capsules is taken into account.",

In experiment 1, the treatment consisted of an ice slurry of strawberry Kool-Aid containing 1.75 g/kg of carbohydrate (polycose) plus either aspartame (34 mg/kg) or the equivalent sweetness as sodium cyclamate and amino acids as alanine. In experiment 2, the treatment consisted of a drink of cold unsweetened strawberry Kool-Aid, containing either 1.75 g/kg of sucrose or 9.7 mg/kg of aspartame. Measures of associative learning, arithmetic calculation, activity level, social interaction, and mood were unaffected by treatment in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the only significant treatment effect was that on the frequency of minor and gross motor behaviors, which were less frequent after the consumption of sucrose than after aspartame. Thus, the effect of aspartame on the short-term behavior of healthy 9- to 10-year-old children appears to be related to its absence of metabolic consequences rather than to its amino acid composition and putative neurochemical impact.",

In experiment 1, either aspartame (34 mg/kg), or the equivalent sweetness of sodium cyclamate, was given in an ice slurry (300 ml) of unsweetened strawberry Kool-Aid with carbohydrate (1.75 g/kg polycose). In experiment 2, drinks (300 ml) contained either sucrose (1.75 g/kg) or aspartame (9.7 mg/kg). In both experiments, significant meal- and time-dependent effects were observed for subjective feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat. Treatments, however, did not affect either subjective feelings of appetite or lunch-time food intake. Thus, aspartame consumed without or with carbohydrate, did not affect either hunger or food intake of children when compared with the sweeteners sodium cyclamate and sucrose, respectively.",

Developmental toxicology studies have been performed in several species documenting no effects of high doses of aspartame. Recently, a study by Mahalik and Gautieri [1984) Res. Commun. Psychol. Psychiatry Behav. 9, 385-403) reported a delay in the achievement age for the visual placing response in mice pups after maternal administration of high dosages of aspartame during late gestation. In the present study developmental parameters were determined in offspring of CF-1 mice after maternal administration of aspartame at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 mg/kg body wt by oral gavage. Aspartame was administered on Days 15 through 18 of gestation. Maternal body weight, food consumption, gestation length, reproductive indices, and litter size were not affected by aspartame treatment. In the pups, body weights, negative geotaxis, and surface and midair righting reflexes were not altered by treatment. There was no delay in the development of the visual placing response regardless of the method employed for assessment (grid or rope) or the manner by which the data were analyzed. There were also no changes in time of eye opening, reflex pupil closure, and ophthalmoscopic examination in the offspring. Thus, neither physical nor functional development was altered in mice after in utero exposure to extremely large dosages of aspartame. More specifically, in utero exposure to aspartame did not affect the development of the visual system in mice.",

A nontreated control group was also maintained. There were no statistically significant effects of the treatment on maternal weight gain, litter size, or birth weight of the pups. Newborn pups were weighed daily and on day 15 were injected with either LiCl or saline and placed in a cage with vanilla odor for 30 min. Twenty-four hr later the pups were permitted to choose between vanilla and lemon odors in a preference test. While both the vehicle-treated control and nontreated control groups injected with LiCl showed a conditioned aversion to vanilla, the aspartame-treated pups injected with LiCl did not. These data indicate that aspartame exposure at 500 mg/kg throughout gestation disrupts odor-associative learning in 15-day-old guinea pigs.",

      "abstract": "The effect of aspartame administered by gavage to rats on amygdala and hippocampal kindled seizures was assessed. Despite the administration of a wide range of doses (25-2000 mg/kg) no evidence for an effect of aspartame on afterdischarge threshold or seizure strength was obtained when testing was done at a time when serum and brain levels of neutral amino acids are known to be significantly elevated as a result of this treatment. There is controversy whether dietary aspartame (N-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester), a food additive sweetner, can lead to seizures in susceptible humans and in laboratory animals. A proseizure effect of high consumption of aspartame has been alleged (Wurtman, 1985; Walton, 1986) and denied (Gaull, 1985). Recent studies using mice have yielded mixed results. Thus, Kim and Kim (1986) and Pinto and Maher (1988) observed potentiating effects of high loads of aspartame on chemically induced seizures, but Nevins, Arnolde and Haigler (1986) observed no effect on chemical and ECS seizures. We used the electrical kindling model of epilepsy to assess whether aspartame can alter seizure threshold or strength in rats. The kindled response is highly repeatable and stable and has been shown to be sensitive to a large variety of pharmacological treatments (Racine, 1978) and to dietary manipulation (McCann, Cain and Philbrick, 1983).",

In subacute dosing experiments aspartame was included in the diet. Brain monoamine concentrations were also measured in the same animals. Plasma concentrations of large neutral amino acids were modified under acute conditions. In contrast, after subacute treatment no significant differences in plasma or brain amino acid concentrations or in brain monoamine concentrations were observed.",

Fifty-nine obese (130-225% of ideal body weight), free living men and women were randomly assigned to either a Balanced Deficit Diet (BDD) or a BDD supplemented with aspartame. Over a 12-week weight loss period, volunteers attended weekly support group meetings including behavior modification training and exercise instruction. Males achieved a clinically significant weight loss (greater than 23 lb) in both study groups, while females lost an average of 12.8 lb in the control group vs. 16.5 lb in the experimental group. In both treatment groups, sleep, general energy level, level of physical activity, and feeling of well-being showed clinically meaningful improvement. This study suggests possible advantages to supplementing a BDD with aspartame-sweetened foods as part of a multidisciplinary weight loss program. The small sample size prohibits definitive conclusions but does provide the protocol for a larger, outpatient clinical trial.",

The incidence rate of headache after aspartame (35 percent) was not significantly different from that after placebo (45 percent) (P less than 0.50). No serious reactions were observed, and the incidence of symptoms other than headache following aspartame was also equivalent to that after placebo. No treatment-related effects were detected in vital signs, blood pressure, or plasma concentrations of cortisol, insulin, glucagon, histamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Most of the subjects were well educated and overweight and had a family or personal history of allergic reactions. The subjects who had headaches had lower plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (P less than 0.0002) and epinephrine (P less than 0.02) just before the development of headache. We conclude that in this population, aspartame is no more likely to produce headache than placebo.",

Plasma PHE levels and ratios to other large neutral amino acids (NAA) rose significantly (p less than 0.05) after all treatments except 0.84 g PHE; plasma tyrosine (TYR) levels increased (p less than 0.05) only when greater than or equal to 2.52 g PHE was given.

      "abstract": "The dipeptide aspartame (NutraSweet) is a newly approved and widely used artificial sweetener in foods and beverages. Consumption of aspartame (ASM) has been reported to be responsible for neurologic and behavioral disturbances in sensitive individuals. Unfasted male CD-1 mice were dosed orally with 13, 130, or 650 mg/kg ASM in corn oil, while control animals received corn oil alone. Three hours after dosing, the animals were killed, and the concentrations of the catecholamines norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), catecholamine metabolites 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelic acid (VMA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the indoleamine serotonin (5-HT), and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were determined by electrochemical high-performance liquid chromatography in six brain regions. ASM exerted its primary effect on adrenergic neurotransmitters in various brain regions. In the hypothalamus, the region richest in NE, increases in NE concentrations of 12, 49, and 47% were found in the low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively, relative to control. Significant increases of NE in the medulla oblongata and corpus striatum were also observed. Increases of the catecholamine DA and catecholamine metabolites VMA, HVA, and DOPAC were seen in various regions. The indoleamine serotonin and its metabolite 5-HIAA were unaffected by ASM treatment. These findings are consistent with ASM-induced increases in the brain catecholamine precursor amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, as reported earlier. Such observed alterations in brain neurotransmitter concentrations may be responsible for the reported clinical and behavioral effects associated with ASM ingestion.",
