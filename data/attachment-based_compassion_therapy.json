      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Higher education, particularly university, is a challenge for many students that can lead to their mental health being seriously affected. The stress to which they are subject throughout their time at university can lead to anxiety and depression. \"Third wave\" psychotherapies, including compassion-based therapy, have been used to improve psychological outcomes, such as stress, anxiety, emotional distress and well-being. There are some signs that third wave psychotherapies reduce psychological distress in university students, but more and higher-quality studies are needed. In this randomised controlled trial (RCT), we hypothesise that the provision of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT) will be more effective than an active control group based on relaxation therapy for improving psychological distress in university students. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm RCT will be conducted involving 140 university undergraduate and postgraduate students from the University of Zaragoza and the National University of Distance Education (UNED) who reside in the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. Interventions with either ABCT or relaxation therapy will be implemented, with an allocation ratio of 1:1 between groups. Both interventions will last six weeks and consist of six weekly group sessions lasting 1.5 h each. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and there will be a follow-up at six months. The primary outcome will be psychological distress at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes will be depression, anxiety, stress and burnout symptoms, affectivity and emotional regulation. Attachment style, experiential avoidance, compassion (for others/oneself) and mindfulness skills will be measured as potential mechanistic variables. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed using linear mixed regression models. The clinical significance of improvements will be calculated. Potential side effects will be monitored by an independent clinical psychologist. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Aragón. Participant data will remain anonymous, and results will be submitted to peer-reviewed open-access journals and disseminated via conferences. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT05197595."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic medical illnesses significantly and negatively affect the quality of life of individuals who suffer them and represent one of the most important challenges faced by healthcare providers and policy-makers due to its rising prevalence and high rates of comorbidity. Compassion-based interventions delivered over the Internet may be a useful approach to facilitate illness management and improve the quality of life of individuals with chronic medical conditions. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to describe a protocol for a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the Internet Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (iABCT) to improve the quality of life and well-being of patients with chronic medical illnesses. METHOD: A two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be carried out, with three assessment points (baseline, 3-month, and 6-month) under two conditions: intervention group and control group (waiting list). The primary outcomes include the quality of life on the EuroQol 5-Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the Pemberton Happiness Index (PHI). Secondary outcomes, such as compassion, self-care behaviors, illness interference, self-criticism, symptomatology, attachment styles, social support, and illness perception, will be considered. Moreover, an assessment on satisfaction and usability will be carried out. A total of 68 participants as minimum will be recruited (34 per arm). Intent-to-treat mixed-model analyses without any ad hoc imputations will be conducted. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study will provide new insights into the potential of self-applied compassion-based interventions (CBI) delivered online in the context of chronic medical illnesses, considering aspects of their implementation (e.g., facilitators, barriers) and mechanisms of change. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered under Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04809610) and it is currently in the participant recruitment phase.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia patients often experience anxiety and depressive symptoms; however, validated interventions show only limited efficacy. This pilot study analyzed the effects of a 16-session version of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT-16) for improving anxiety and depressive symptomatology, as well as self-compassion and decentering, in 11 fibromyalgia patients. Scales were assessed at four time points: baseline, after sessions 8 and 16, and 3.5 months after the completion of the program. Significant improvements were found in all outcomes after the program, and most remained significant in the follow-up assessment. Our preliminary results suggest that ABCT-16 can be effective for improving anxiety and depressive symptomatology in fibromyalgia patients. Nonetheless, further studies with larger samples and control groups are necessary to confirm these results.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT) for reducing affective distress in a sample of outpatients with depressive, anxiety, or adjustment disorders, and to explore its mechanisms of action. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial involved the assessment time points of pretreatment, posttreatment and 6-month follow-up. A total of 90 patients from three mental health units in Castellón, Spain, were recruited and randomly assigned to \"ABCT + treatment as usual (TAU),\" \"Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) + TAU\" or \"TAU\" alone. Affective distress, as measured by the \"Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales\" (DASS-21) was the main outcome; self-compassion and mindfulness were also assessed. Multilevel mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effectiveness of the program, and path analyses were conducted to study the potential mechanistic role of mindfulness and self-compassion. RESULTS: ABCT was not superior to MBSR in any outcome or at any assessment point. ABCT was superior to TAU alone both posttreatment (B = -13.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -19.57, -6.84) and at 6-month follow-up (B = -7.20; 95% CI: -13.63, -0.76) for reducing DASS-21, and MBSR was superior to TAU alone both posttreatment (B = -11.51; 95% CI: -17.97, -5.05) and at 6-month follow-up (B = -8.59; 95% CI: -15.09, -2.10), with large effects (d ≥ 0.90). Changes produced by ABCT in DASS-21 were mediated by self-compassion, whereas changes produced by MBSR were mediated by both mindfulness and self-compassion. CONCLUSION: ABCT is effective for reducing affective distress in patients with anxiety, depressive and adjustment disorders, although its effect is not superior to that offered by MBSR. Self-compassion seems to be a significant mediator of the effects of ABCT.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Compassion-based interventions delivered over the internet are showing promising results for the promotion of psychological health and well-being. Several studies have highlighted their feasibility, acceptance, and preliminary efficacy. However, this is an incipient field of research, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no data available from Spanish-speaking countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility, acceptance, and preliminary efficacy of the Internet Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (iABCT), a web-based version of the Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy, in Spanish speakers from the general population. METHODS: This feasibility study features a single-arm, uncontrolled, within-group design with an embedded qualitative and quantitative process evaluation at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at the 3-month follow-up. A minimum of 35 participants from the general population will be allocated to iABCT. Feasibility measures will include attrition rate, patterns of use of the web-based system, and participants' acceptability, usability, and opinion. The primary outcome was measured using the Pemberton Happiness Index. Secondary outcomes were measured using the Compassion Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, Forms of Self-Criticizing/Attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale-Short form, Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire, Relationships Questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire, Non-Attachment Scale, International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form, Purpose-In-Life Test, and difficulties regarding the practice of compassion (Compassion Practice Quality Questionnaire). Mixed models will be used to evaluate primary and secondary outcome measures. A qualitative content analysis of the participants' qualitative responses will also be performed. RESULTS: Enrollment started in February 2020 and will be finished in April 2020. Data analysis will start in October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will, for the first time, show data on the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of web-based compassion (and self-compassion) training-that is, the adapted iABCT-in Spanish speakers from the general population. Further aspects of their implementation (ie, facilitators, barriers, and unwanted effects) and mechanisms of change will be investigated. This study will allow the revision and fine-tuning of the developed intervention, study design, and planning procedures, as well as the initiation of a future randomized controlled trial.

      "abstract": "A recent study has supported the efficacy of Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (ABCT) compared to relaxation (REL) for the management of fibromyalgia (FM). The main objective of this paper is to examine the cost-utility of ABCT compared to REL in terms of effects on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as well as healthcare costs. Forty-two Spanish patients with FM received 8 weekly group sessions of ABCT or REL. Data collection took place at pre- and 3-month follow-up. Cost-utility of the two treatment groups (ABCT vs. REL) was compared by examining treatment outcomes in terms of QALYs (obtained with the EQ-5D-3L) and healthcare costs (data about service use obtained with the Client Service Receipt Inventory). Data analyses were computed from a completers, ITT, and per protocol approach. Data analysis from the healthcare perspective revealed that those patients receiving ABCT exhibited larger improvements in quality of life than those doing relaxation, while being less costly 3 months after their 8-week treatment program had ended (completers: incremental cost M, 95% CI = €-194.1 (-450.3 to 356.1); incremental effect M, 95% CI = 0.023 QALYs (0.010 to 0.141)). Results were similar using an ITT approach (incremental cost M, 95% CI = €-256.3 (-447.4 to -65.3); incremental effect M, 95% CI = 0.021 QALYs (0.009 to 0.033)). A similar pattern of results were obtained from the per protocol approach. This RCT has contributed to the evidence base of compassion-based interventions and provided useful information about the cost-utility of ABCT for FM patients when compared to relaxation. However, the small sample size and short follow-up period limited the generalizability of the findings."

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disabling syndrome characterized by chronic pain associated with fatigue. Its pathogenesis is unknown, but alterations in central sensitization, involving an imbalance of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory biomarkers, appear to be implicated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT) on levels of BDNF, the inflammatory markers TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and the C-reactive protein (CRP), analysing whether biomarkers play a mediating/moderating role in improvements in FM functional status. Thirty-four female patients with FM participated in a RCT and were assigned to ABCT or relaxation therapy. Blood extractions were conducted at baseline and post-intervention, with self-report assessments of functional status (FIQ) at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. A pro-inflammatory composite was obtained by summing up IL-6, TNF-α and CRP normalized values. Non-parametric tests, analysis of variance and regression models were used to evaluate treatment and mediation/moderation. Compared to relaxation therapy, ABCT showed significant improvements in FIQ and decreases in BDNF, CRP, and pro-inflammatory composite. Changes in BDNF had a mediating role in FIQ. ABCT seems to reduce BDNF and appears to have anti-inflammatory effects in FM patients. Reductions in BDNF could be a mechanism of FM functional status improvement.Clinical Trial Registration: http://ClinicalTrials.gov , identifier NCT02454244. Date: May 27th, 2015.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Depressive, anxiety and adjustment disorders are highly prevalent among mental health outpatients. The lack of funding for mental health problems produces inefficient results and a high burden of disease. New cost-effective group interventions aimed at treating these symptoms might be an appropriate solution to reduce the healthcare burden in mental health units. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have shown significant reductions in anxious, depressive and adjustment symptomatology. Recent research highlights the influence of compassion as a key mechanism of change. However, MBIs only address compassion implicitly, whereas compassion-based protocols consider it a core aspect of psychotherapy. In this randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that the provision of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT), which is a compassion-based protocol, will be more effective than mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which is a conventional MBI programme, for the treatment of depressive, anxious and adaptive symptoms in patients in mental health settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Approximately 90 patients suffering from depressive, anxious or adjustment disorders recruited from Spanish mental health settings will be randomised to receive 8 weekly 2 hours group sessions of ABCT, 8 weekly 2.5 hours group sessions of adapted MBSR (with no full-day silent retreat) or treatment as usual (TAU), with a 1:1:1 allocation rate. Patients in the ABCT and adapted MBSR groups will also receive TAU. The main outcome will be general affective distress measured by means of the 'Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21' at post-test as primary endpoint. Other outcomes will be quality of life, mindfulness, self-compassion and the use of healthcare services. There will be a 6-month follow-up assessment. Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted using linear mixed models. Per-protocol and secondary outcome analyses will be performed. A data monitoring committee comprising the trial manager, the ABCT and MBSR teachers and an independent clinical psychologist will monitor for possible negative side effects. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the General University Hospital of Castellón, Spain. The results will be submitted to peer-reviewed specialised journals, and brief reports will be sent to participants on request. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03425487.",

The present study evaluated the effectiveness of \"attachment-based compassion therapy\" (ABCT) in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM), and the role of psychological flexibility as a mediator of improvements. METHODS: A total of 42 patients with FM were randomly assigned to ABCT or relaxation (active control group). Both the intervention and control condition were combined with treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome was functional status (FIQ), and the secondary outcomes were clinical severity (CGI-S), pain catastrophizing (PCS), anxiety (HADS-A), depression (HADS-D), quality of life (EQ-5D), and psychological flexibility (AAQ-II). Differences between the groups were estimated using mixed-effects models, and mediation assessments were conducted using path analyses. RESULTS: The ABCT group demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the relaxation group, including better FIQ values after treatment (B = -3.01; p = 0.003). Differences in FIQ were maintained at 3-month follow-up (B = -3.33; p = 0.001). The absolute risk reduction in ABCT compared to relaxation increased by 40.0%, with an NNT = 3 based on criteria of ≥50% FIQ reduction after treatment. Psychological flexibility had a significant mediating effect on improvements. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ABCT combined with TAU appears to be effective in the treatment of FM symptoms.
