      "abstract": "N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) is a medication and a widely used antioxidant in cell death research. Despite its somewhat obscure mechanism of action, its role in inhibiting ferroptosis is gaining increasing recognition. In this study, we demonstrate that NAC treatment rapidly replenishes the intracellular cysteine pool, reinforcing its function as a prodrug for cysteine. Interestingly, its enantiomer, N-acetyl-d-cysteine (d-NAC), which cannot be converted into cysteine, also exhibits a strong anti-ferroptotic effect. We further clarify that NAC, d-NAC, and cysteine all act as direct reducing substrates for GPX4, counteracting lipid peroxidation. Consequently, only GPX4-rather than system xc-, glutathione biosynthesis, or ferroptosis suppressor protein 1-is necessary for NAC and d-NAC to prevent ferroptosis. Additionally, we identify a broad range of reducing substrates for GPX4 in vitro, including β-mercaptoethanol. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of NAC and other potential GPX4-reducing substrates against ferroptosis."

      "abstract": "Conventional adsorbents for Hg(II) are not suitable for acidic environments because they degrade and lose activity. In this study, high-density sulfur and nitrogen-containing porous polyacrylonitrile sheet (HSN-PANS) was developed by grafting l-cysteine. The amphoteric HSN-PANS adsorbent can effectively remove Hg(II) from acidic wastewater, reducing its concentration from 11 mg/L to below the drinking water standard of 1 μg/L at pH 2. It shows high adsorption capacity (764 mg/g), strong anti-interference properties, and excellent selectivity. The adsorption mechanism involves coordination and electrostatic interactions. Thanks to its stable structure and efficient desorption, HSN-PANS demonstrates excellent acid resistance and reusability, retaining 99.9 % adsorption efficiency after 43 cycles. Furthermore, it performs reliably in industrial wastewater treatment. Notably, an HSN-PANS-packed column can treat about 5845 bed volumes (69 L) of Hg(II)-spiked acidic wastewater until reaching a breakthrough point of 1 μg/L, concentrating the adsorbed Hg(II) into 1.8 L of desorbent. This study demonstrates the potential of HSN-PANS as an effective adsorbent for directly and efficiently removing Hg(II) from acidic wastewater, providing a promising solution to reduce Hg(II) emissions in industrial processes."

      "abstract": "D-Ribose-L-Cysteine (Riboceine)- an antioxidant supplement that may help to raise the glutathione levels by acting as a precursor for glutathione biosynthesis in biological systems. Effect of riboceine (Rb) on sodium arsenite (SA) induced hepatorenal toxicity was investigated in rats. Four groups (A-D) (six per group) were treated thus: Group A (water and normal diet only); while Group B (SA at 5 mg/kg body weight); Group C (riboceine at 10 mg/kg body weight) and Group D (riboceine and SA). The exposure to test substances lasted for a total of 14 days in each case in which pre-treatment was done with riboceine. Exposure to SA triggered a significant reduction in the entire weight and relative organ weight, increase in ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALP (alkaline phosphatase) activities, decrease in liver total protein and increase in serum levels of urea and creatinine. Furthermore, SA caused a significant reduction in GSH (glutathione) level and CAT (Catalase) activity, while the LPO (lipid peroxidation) and NO (nitric oxide) levels were significantly increased. Pre-treatment with riboceine, restored the levels of the aforementioned parameters. Riboceine also promote restoration of hepatocytes and renal cells integrity. Findings from this study reaffirm the hepatorenal toxicities of sodium arsenite and show the protective role of riboceine against SA-induced toxicities. Protective effects of riboceine may be via the enhancement of the level of glutathione, a natural scavenger of free radicals.",

      "abstract": "The key fatty acid β-oxidation protein acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2) plays a significant role in myocardial lipid peroxidation and cardiac dysfunction induced by renal insufficiency. However, the mechanisms of lipid metabolism related to renal insufficiency-associated cardiac dysfunction remain poorly understood, and current clinical treatments have been largely ineffective. Through analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we identified that the cardiac functional changes caused by renal insufficiency were primarily centered around the fatty acid β-oxidation signaling pathway, where ACAA2 plays a pivotal role in fatty acid β-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and ketone body metabolism. In an adenine-induced renal insufficiency mouse model, further examination with hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining, and Oil Red O staining revealed alterations in the heart and kidney as well as the accumulation of lipid. Non-invasive blood pressure measurements and ultrasound images demonstrated improvements of peripheral vascular and right ventricular hemodynamic parameters with S-nitroso-L-cysteine (CSNO) inhalation therapy. In cell experiments, knocking down ACAA2 led to accumulation of lipid droplets and exacerbation of oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes, while overexpression of ACAA2 reversed these effects. The transcription factor FOXO4 was found to regulate lipid peroxidation by modulating ACAA2, and knocking down FOXO4 partially restored the expression of ACAA2, reducing oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, exogenous CSNO effectively restored the expression of ACAA2 and reduced the level of FOXO4, thereby mitigating lipid peroxidation and improving cardiac function. Therefore, in the context of renal insufficiency, regulating the FOXO4-ACAA2 axis through CSNO inhalation therapy may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for alleviating myocardial lipid peroxidation and improving cardiac function.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that impacts millions of individuals globally. In the treatment of this condition, it is imperative to explore natural resources for therapeutic agents that exhibit fewer adverse effects and enhanced efficacy. Currently, the methods employed for isolating anti-diabetic lead compounds from natural sources are often intricate and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient and rapid screening techniques. In this study, α-amylase was immobilized using a novel polydopamine/L-cysteine bifunctionalized magnetic mesoporous silica composite material (Fe3O4@nSiO2@mSiO2@PDA@L-Cys) for the first time. A ligand fishing approach utilizing the immobilized α-amylase was developed to rapidly screen for α-amylase inhibitors from Aloe vera. Characterization and property analysis of the immobilized enzyme showed that the immobilized α-amylase exhibited exceptional stability and reusability. Two ligands were successfully screened from Aloe vera and then characterized as aloin B and aloin A using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Their respective IC50 values were 0.99 ± 0.09 mM and 1.14 ± 0.05 mM. Molecular docking studies confirmed the interaction of both ligands with specific amino acid residues within the active site of α-amylase. The study presents a fast and efficient approach for screening α-amylase inhibitors from intricate natural sources, thereby offering significant potential for the development of anti-diabetic agents."

      "abstract": "Female fertility has been demonstrated to be directly correlated with cadmium, a heavy metal contaminant that is widely present in the environment. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a powerful antioxidant, has been shown to have therapeutic effects for a number of ailments. NAC's potential to prevent ovarian toxicity caused by Cd is still unknown. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the concentration- and time-dependent protective effect of NAC supplementation against Cd-induced granulosa cell toxicity in healthy caprine ovaries. The in vitro cultured ovaries/follicles were subjected to different cytotoxic (ethidium bromide and acridine orange [EB/AO] staining), histomorphological, and biochemical analyses during study. The results revealed that NAC treatment significantly attenuated the Cd-instigated cytotoxicity in granulosa cells, as evidenced by diminished apoptotic attributes in NAC co-supplemented groups compared to only Cd-exposed groups. Moreover, NAC markedly restored the decline in enzymatic activity of antioxidant enzymes (GST, SOD, and CAT), along with ferric reducing antioxidant power, further diminishing the formation of MDA in Cd exposed caprine ovary. The findings of this study indicated that Cd, being an ovarian toxicant, adversely affects the female reproductive system. However, simultaneous NAC administration significantly reduced the Cd-caused ovarian damage, indicating that NAC has therapeutic potential in controlling female gonadotoxicity due to gradually growing environmental Cd pollution."

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoke (CS) is a key contributor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, its role in the pathogenesis of COPD has not been fully elucidated. N‑acetyl‑L‑cysteine (NAC), as an antioxidant, has been used in the treatment of COPD; however, the mechanisms of action of NAC are not fully understood. Alveolar epithelial type 2 (ATII) cells serve an essential role in the maintenance of alveolar integrity. The aim of the present study was to identify the effect of CS on rat lungs and ATII cells. A subacute lung injury model of Wistar rats was established using CS exposure for 4 weeks. Interalveolar septa widening, infiltration of inflammatory cells, edema fluid in airspaces and abnormal enlargement of airspaces were observed through H&E staining. ELISA revealed that NAC could protect against CS‑induced increases in serum levels of malondialdehyde and decreases in serum levels of superoxide dismutase. Additionally, 8‑hydroxy‑deoxyguanosine was detected using immunohistochemical staining, and this was also expressed at increased levels in the lung tissue of the CS‑exposed group. In addition, the expression levels of Bcl‑2, BAX and caspase‑3 p12 in lung tissue were detected by western blotting or immunohistochemical staining. The expression levels of Bcl‑2 decreased and those of caspase3 p12 were increased in response to CS exposure when compared with those in the control group. These effects were prevented by treatment with NAC. In vitro, the effect of CS extract (CSE) on rat lung epithelial‑6‑T‑antigen negative (RLE‑6TN) cells was observed, flow cytometry was used to detect intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the occurrence of apoptosis, and the content of glutathione (GSH) was detected using a colorimetric assay. Additionally, the expression levels of heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1), p53 and Bcl‑2 were examined by western blotting, and HO‑1 mRNA expression was also examined using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The results of the present study revealed that CSE induced apoptosis of RLE‑6TN cells, accompanied by increased levels of intracellular ROS and exhaustion of GSH. Significantly increased protein levels of HO‑1 and p53, as well as decreased protein levels of Bcl‑2 were also observed. These effects were prevented by administration of NAC. Overall, these findings suggested that CS could promote apoptosis in rat lung tissues and alveolar epithelial cells by inducing intracellular oxidative injury, and NAC may serve an antioxidant role by replenishing the intracellular GSH content.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of sulfur-containing drugs, disulfiram (DSF) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), in alleviating neuroinflammation is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of DSF and NAC on memory and on the metabolism of L-cysteine and inflammation-related parameters in the cerebral cortex of rats in a model of neuroinflammation induced by the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: All the treatments were administered intraperitoneally for 10 days (LPS at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg b.w., DSF at a dose of 100 mg/kg b.w, and NAC at a dose of 100 mg/kg b.w.). Behavior was evaluated by the novel object recognition (NOR) test and object location (OL) test, and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was assayed to evaluate neuronal functioning. Cerebral cortex homogenates were tested for hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfane sulfur, sulfates, non-protein sulfhydryl groups (NPSH), nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Neither DSF nor NAC alleviated LPS-induced memory disorders estimated by the NOR test and OL test. The studied compounds also did not affect significantly the levels of BDNF, ROS, NO, H2S, and sulfane sulfur in the cerebral cortex. However, we observed an increase in sulfate concentration in brain tissues after LPS treatment, while DSF and NAC caused an additional increase in sulfate concentration. On the other hand, our study showed that the administration of DSF or NAC together with LPS significantly enhanced the cortical level of NPSH, of which glutathione is the main component. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not confirm the suggested potential of DSF and NAC to correct memory disorders; however, it corroborated the notion that they reduced oxidative stress induced by LPS by increasing the NPSH level. Additionally, our study showed an increase in sulfate concentration in the brain tissues after LPS treatment, which means the upregulation of sulfite and sulfate production in inflammatory conditions.",

However, fresh-cut mushrooms preservation is challenging in distribution and consumption. The present study discovered that exogenous L-cysteine (L-Cys) treatment delayed the weight loss, browning degree, nutrition depletion and microbial contamination of fresh-cut Changgen mushrooms at 4 °C. Based on transcriptomic data, exogenous L-Cys significantly activated the metabolism of 17 amino acids, including L-Cys and methionine, a prerequisite for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis. Exogenous L-Cys also stimulated the activities and gene expressions of cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase, thereby increasing H2S levels. Furthermore, exogenous L-Cys enhanced the energy metabolism by improving cytochrome c oxidase, H+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase enzymes activity. Exogenous L-Cys treatment reduced the reactive oxygen species by regulating enzyme activities such as polyphenol oxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase. This study contributes valuable insights into the physiological function of L-Cys and the role of H2S on the fresh-cut Changgen mushroom."

Compared with total 25(OH)VD levels, measurement of bioavailable 25(OH)VD is a better method to determine the beneficial effect of VD. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether cosupplementation with VD and L-cysteine (LC), which downregulates inflammation and upregulates VD-regulating genes, provides a better therapeutic benefit than supplementation with VD-alone in African Americans (AA). METHODS: AA participants (men/women, aged 18-65 years; n=165) were block randomised into one of four groups and received daily, oral supplementation for 6 months with placebo, LC (1000 mg/day), VD (2000 IU/day) or VD+LC. Fasting blood collected at the baseline and final visits was analysed for total, free and bioavailable 25(OH)VD along with insulin, VD-binding protein (VDBP), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free and total testosterone, and inflammatory marker levels. Studies were carried out in THP-1 monocytes to elucidate the direct effect of LC and testosterone on VD-regulating genes. RESULTS: Baseline data showed no differences in age, body mass index, calcium, liver or kidney function among the groups. Compared with levels in the group that received VD-alone supplementation, levels of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, C reactive protein, HOMA-IR, VDBP and HbA1c were significantly lower in the VD+LC group while the VD+LC group showed a significant increase in bioavailable 25(OH)VD in both sexes, total 25(OH)VD levels were significantly elevated in men but not in women treated with VD+LC. Blood levels of SHBG and free/total testosterone were elevated in the VD+LC group but not in the VD-alone group. LC and testosterone treatment significantly upregulated VD-metabolising genes (CYP2R1/CYP27A1/CYP27B1/VDR) and SHBG in THP-1 monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: VD cosupplemented with LC upregulates circulating bioavailable 25(OH)VD and reduces inflammation. Total 25(OH)VD levels were higher in men but not in women in the VD+LC group. This pilot study suggests that compared with supplementation with VD-alone, VD+LC cosupplementation could be a better approach to raising the total 25(OH)VD in men and the bioavailable 25(OH)VD in both sexes and lowering the inflammatory risk in the AA population.

The hormonal profile, routine exams and insulin and C-peptide response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of a daily oral complementary treatment with L-carnitine (500 mg), acetyl-L-carnitine (250 mg), L-arginine (500 mg), L-cysteine (100 mg) and myo-inositol (1 gr). The hepatic insulin extraction index was also calculated. RESULTS: The mix of complementary substances significantly improved metabolic parameters, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index values and gonadotropin plasma levels. Glucose, C-peptide and insulin response to OGTT was significantly reduced as well as the hepatic insulin extraction index. CONCLUSION: The administration of a combination of carnitines, L-arginine, L-cysteine and myoinositol improved gonadotropin plasma levels and insulin sensitivity in overweight/obese PCOS patients and restored hepatic clearance of insulin as demonstrated by the decreased hepatic insulin extraction index.",

      "abstract": "Oocyte quality can affect mammal fertilization rate, early embryonic development, pregnancy maintenance, and fetal development. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the most important causes of poor oocyte maturation in vitro. To reduce the degree of cellular damage caused by ROS, supplementation with the antioxidant N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) serves as an effective pathway to alleviate glutathione (GSH) depletion during oxidative stress. This study investigated the effects of NAC supplementation during in vitro maturation of goat oocytes and explored the molecular mechanisms of maturation by transcriptome sequencing of MⅡ oocytes. The results showed that 1.5 mM NAC significantly increased the rates of oocyte maturation and cumulus cell expansion and improved the subsequent development of embryos. During the subsequent culture of parthenogenetically activated embryos, 1.5 mM NAC significantly increased the division rate of oocytes and blastocyst rate. It also reduced the accumulation of ROS, increased the level of GSH, alleviated oxidative stress, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity and cell metabolic activity. Transcriptome sequencing results revealed that NAC treatment significantly increased the expression of SIRT1, GGCT, and MITF genes related to the cellular antioxidant system, as well as the IDH3G gene related to energy metabolism, and decreased the expression of CASP8, FOS, and MMP1 genes related to apoptosis and cell invasion, as well as the CCL2. and CXCL8 genes related to the inflammatory response. In conclusion, the findings suggest that NAC supplementation significantly reduces oxidative stress, improves antioxidant capacity and metabolic activity, promotes oocyte maturation, and improves oocyte quality.",

The presence of the functional groups significantly enhanced the capacity of the material for Hg(Ⅱ). According to the Langmuir model, the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity was calculated to be 1321.4 mg/g, which is 20 times that of the original UiO-66. Thermodynamic study revealed that the adsorption of Hg(II) onto UiO-66-l-cys is a spontaneous and endothermic process, thus exhibiting an elevated adsorption capacity at higher temperatures. XPS results confirmed that the sulfhydryl (SH) and amino (NH2) groups react with Hg(Ⅱ), enabling the material to adsorb a large quantity of Hg(Ⅱ). Through DFT theoretical calculation and simulation, it has been found that S atoms and N atoms exhibit significant attraction to Hg atoms. Moreover, the corrosion potential of UiO-66 in Hg solution becomes lower. It is demonstrated that it has a faster electron transfer rate, which is conducive to the adsorption process. Furthermore, UiO-66-l-cys exhibited an excellent cyclic stability, with only a 2.7 % decrease in adsorption capacity after five cycles. This method eliminates the necessity for the pre-synthesis of complex chemical ligands and intricate chemical reactions. It also streamlines the process, and lowers material costs. The UiO-66-l-cys exhibits considerable potential applications for the treatment of heavy metal pollution."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of L-cysteine (L-cys) on postharvest Chinese flowering cabbage stored at 20 °C. The results showed that 0.5 g L-1 L-cys treatment effectively slowed leaf senescence by downregulating chlorophyll degradation genes (BrNYC1, BrNOL, BrPPH, BrPAO, BrNYE, and BrSAGs) and senescence marker gene BrSAG12. Moreover, this treatment exhibited positive influence on the nutritional quality of cabbage. Also, L-cys treatment maintained ROS homeostasis, preventing excessive ROS accumulation and lipid membrane oxidation. L-cys treatment also maintained a higher total antioxidant capacity and scavenging rate of •OH and O2•-. Additionally, L-cys treatment maintained high levels of ascorbate and glutathione and activated antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) and the expression of the encoding genes. Furthermore, L-cys treatment elevated endogenous H2S levels, which are correlated with increased L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity and the upregulation of H2S biosynthesis-related genes. These findings suggest that L-cys can delay leaf senescence by reducing chlorophyll breakdown, maintaining ROS homeostasis, and stimulating endogenous H2S production."

      "abstract": "Cisplatin (CIS) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, but its side effects, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, often lead to male reproductive damage. Oxidative stress, primarily caused by the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a critical role in disrupting testicular homeostasis, resulting in spermatogenic impairment and tissue injury. L-cysteine (CYS), a semi-essential amino acid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may offer protection against CIS-induced oxidative damage. This study aimed to assess the protective potential of CYS against CIS-induced male reproductive toxicity using in vivo and in vitro models. In vitro, treatment of TM3 (Leydig) and TM4 (Sertoli) cells with CIS led to increased ROS levels, reduced cell viability, and elevated apoptosis and inflammation, all of which were significantly ameliorated by subsequent CYS exposure. In vivo, CIS-treated male rats displayed heightened oxidative stress, impaired spermatogenesis, and histopathological damage in reproductive organs. However, CYS administration for 21 days significantly reduced oxidative stress, improved sperm viability, and protected testicular tissues from damage. These findings suggest that CYS has a protective effect against CIS-induced oxidative stress and male reproductive damage, making it a promising therapeutic agent for mitigating CIS-induced reproductive toxicity."

Although the effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is investigated in the recovery of liver damage, gas plasma therapy can be identified as a promising candidate. Our study aimed to enhance the effectiveness of ineffective doses of NAC in stopping CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats by physical cold plasma. The plasma-treated NAC (PTN) structural changes were investigated through FTIR and LCMS/MS analysis. It was observed that the PTN consists of various chemical bioproducts with different molecular weights. We investigated an ineffective dose of NAC and its parallel effect through the administration of PTN on liver and kidney morphology and several biochemical factors including ALT, AST, and ALP. Additionally, we examined oxidative stress, antioxidant parameters, and glutathione (GSH) levels. Results showed that PTN exhibited greater antioxidant properties and increased GSH levels, contributing to its therapeutic effects. Also, the antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress activities improved after receiving PTN. It also enhanced histological parameters, although various damages were detected in both liver and kidney tissues after CCl4 injection, PTN remarkably prevented the tissue changes caused by CCl4. PTN could protect against liver damage even at a very low dose of NAC, acting as a prophylactic drug with a high margin of safety for hepatotoxicity.",

Here we explored whether supplemental n-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) recovers the age-associated complications relative to osteoblastic Wntless (Wls) ablation and examined the possible mechanisms therein. For this work, we administered Col2.3-Cre;Wlsfl/fl mutant and littermate control (Wlsfl/fl) mice (14 weeks of age) with NAC (40 mM)-supplemented or NAC-free water for four weeks. A proportion of these mice received non-critical-sized femoral defects at 16 weeks of age. Blood, bone, and bone marrow (BM) samples were collected and adjusted for in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro analyses. Osteoblastic Wls deletion delayed bone mass accrual and the healing of bone defects, stimulated osteoclastic activation and inflammatory factor expression, and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity in the BM. Osteoblastic Wls deletion also promoted oxidative stress, apoptosis, and senescence in BM stromal cells (BMSCs) and decreased BMSC' multipotencies. Supplementation of Wlsfl/fl mice with NAC enhanced bone mass accrual and regenerative bone healing via a Wnt signal-associated osteogenic activation. However, supplemental NAC induced new bone formation in the mutant mice by inhibiting the age-related complications of BM/BMSCs, as well as by restoring endogenous antioxidant system without any alterations in Wnt ligand secretion, hematopoiesis, and expression of osteogenic and growth factors. This study indicates that supplemental NAC protects mice against Wnt deficiency-mediated and age-associated degenerative complications. Overall, this study highlights the therapeutic potency of NAC for restoring the antioxidant system, stem cell function, and regenerative bone homeostasis in osteoblastic Wls-dispensable manner.",

Recently, the advent of cuproptosis, a novel programmed cell death, offers hope in fighting osteosarcoma. In this study, we introduce SAHAm@{[Cu(HA-Cys)2]Cl2}n, an injectable hyaluronate-L-cysteine hydrogel that integrates both copper ions (Cu2+) and vorinostat (SAHA) for the possible therapeutic effect. The Cu2+ targets the TCA cycle, inducing cuproptosis in osteosarcoma cells. While SAHA acts as both a histone deacetylase inhibitor and an ROS generator for eliminating tumor cells. The mechanism involves amplifying FDX-1 expression via SAHA modulation of the TCA cycle, which was an original discovery. Critically, the combined mechanisms and localized injection enables the hydrogel partially eradicating osteosarcoma without metastasis in rats. Therefore, this study advances cuproptosis induced photothermal therapy for promising clinical translations, shedding light on favorable prognosis for osteosarcoma."

After being sprayed with 0.2 mM SAC, rice seedlings had a NO content that was 1.8 times higher than that of the control (ctrl) group at the ninth hour, which then gradually decreased. The expressions of Cd uptake and transport genes in the roots (including OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, and OsHMA2) were markedly downregulated by 27.2%, 24.8%, and 49.1%, respectively, 72 h after SAC spraying treatment. The Cd content in seedling roots' cell wall (CW) components significantly increased by 43.5% compared to that of the ctrl group. The Cd content in the shoots and roots decreased by 49.0% and 29.8%, respectively. Cd stress in the seedlings was also substantially alleviated. In conclusion, spraying rice seedlings with SAC triggered an increase in NO synthesis, regulated the expression of genes related to Cd transport, increased Cd fixation in the root CW components, and reduced Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots."

The current study is aimed to evaluate the protective efficacy of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) decorated with l-cysteine in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity in the Swiss albino rats as an animal model. The rats were divided into four treatment groups: Group 1 (control without any treatments), Group 2 treated with AgNPs and l-cysteine composite (5 mg/kg body weight on every third day), Group 3 (single dose of 1 mL/kg CCl4), and Group 4 treated with AgNPs-l-cysteine composite in the rats pre-administered with CCl4. After treatment for a month, the rats were killed, and their liver and blood samples were subjected to biochemical analysis and histological examination.: Group 2 showed all the parameters comparable to control Group 1. On the contrary, CCl4-treated, Group 3 rats showed abnormally raised liver function markers (AST and ALT) and liver toxicity markers (GGT, LDH, and total bilirubin) concomitant with disturbed oxidative stress parameters (GSH and MDA) compared to the control. However, Group 4 rats demonstrated a significant recovery from CCl4-induced biochemical alteration in the animals as compared to Group 3. In addition, the biochemical measurements were harmonious with the histological analysis of the liver sections of the treated rats.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Paternal nutrition before conception has a marked impact on offspring's risk of developing metabolic disorders during adulthood. Research on human cohorts and animal models has shown that paternal obesity alters sperm epigenetics (DNA methylation, protamine-to-histone replacement, and non-coding RNA content), leading to adverse health outcomes in the offspring. So far, the mechanistic events that translate paternal nutrition into sperm epigenetic changes remain unclear. High-fat diet (HFD)-driven paternal obesity increases gonadic Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which modulate enzymes involved in epigenetic modifications of DNA during spermatogenesis. Thus, the gonadic pool of ROS might be responsible for transducing paternal health status to the zygote through germ cells. METHODS: The involvement of ROS in paternal intergenerational transmission was assessed by modulating the gonadic ROS content in male mice. Testicular oxidative stress induced by HFD was counterbalanced by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant precursor of GSH. The sires were divided into four feeding groups: i) control diet; ii) HFD; iii) control diet in the presence of NAC; and iv) HFD in the presence of NAC. After 8 weeks, males were mated with females that were fed a control diet. Antioxidant treatment was then evaluated in terms of preventing the HFD-induced transmission of dysmetabolic traits from obese fathers to their offspring. The offspring were weaned onto a regular control diet until week 16 and then underwent metabolic evaluation. The methylation status of the genomic region IGFII/H19 and cyp19a1 in the offspring gDNA was also assessed using Sanger sequencing and methylation-dependent qPCR. RESULTS: Supplementation with NAC protected sires from HFD-induced weight gain, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance. NAC reduced oxidative stress in the gonads of obese fathers and improved sperm viability. However, NAC did not prevent the transmission of epigenetic modifications from father to offspring. Male offspring of HFD-fed fathers, regardless of NAC treatment, exhibited hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and hypoandrogenism. Additionally, they showed altered methylation at the epigenetically controlled loci IGFII/H19 and cy19a1. CONCLUSION: Although NAC supplementation improved the health status and sperm quality of HFD-fed male mice, it did not prevent the epigenetic transmission of metabolic disorders to their offspring. Different NAC dosages and antioxidants other than NAC might represent alternatives to stop the intergenerational transmission of paternal dysmetabolic traits."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play critical roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Glutathione (GSH), a key brain antioxidant, helps to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintain redox balance. We investigated the effectiveness of L-cysteine (L-Cys) in preventing apoptosis induced by the ROS generator 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ) in mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells, as well as alleviating memory and cognitive impairments caused by the GSH synthesis inhibitor L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in mice. DMNQ-induced apoptotic events in HT22 cells, including elevated cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS levels, DNA fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptotic pathways were dose-dependently abrogated by L-Cys (0.5-2 mM). The reduced intracellular GSH level, caused by DMNQ treatment, was restored by L-Cys cotreatment. Although L-Cys did not significantly restore GSH in the presence of BSO, it prevented DMNQ-induced ROS elevation, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis. Furthermore, compared to N-acetylcysteine and GSH, L-Cys had higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid radical-scavenging activity. L-Cys also restored mitochondrial respiration capacity in DMNQ-treated HT22 cells by reversing mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamic balance. BSO administration (500 mg/kg/day) in mice led to neuronal deficits, including memory and cognitive impairments, which were effectively mitigated by oral L-Cys (15 or 30 mg/kg/day). L-Cys also reduced BSO-induced ROS levels in the mice hippocampus and cortex. These findings suggest that even though it does not contribute to intracellular GSH synthesis, exogenous L-Cys protects neuronal cells against oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, by acting as a ROS scavenger, which is beneficial in ameliorating neurocognitive deficits caused by oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor characterized by a strong affinity for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptors (VEGFRs). It was approved in 2012 by Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a second line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma and is currently under evaluation in clinical trial for the treatment of other cancers. Glioblastoma IDH-wild type (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumor characterized by diffusely infiltrative growth pattern and by a prominent neo-angiogenesis. In GBM, axitinib has demonstrated a limited effectiveness as a monotherapy, while it was recently shown to significantly improve its efficacy in combination treatments. In preclinical models, axitinib has been reported to trigger cellular senescence both in tumor as well as in normal cells, through a mechanism involving intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and activation of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated kinase (ATM). Limiting axitinib-dependent ROS increase by antioxidants prevents senescence specifically in normal cells, without affecting tumor cells. METHODS: We used brain tumor xenografts obtained by engrafting Glioma Stem Cells (GSCs) into the brain of immunocompromised mice, to investigate the hypothesis that the antioxidant molecule N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) might be used to reduce senescence-associated adverse effects of axitinib treatment without altering its anti-tumor activity. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the use of the antioxidant molecule N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) in combination with axitinib stabilizes tumor microvessels in GBM tumor orthotopic xenografts, eventually resulting in vessel normalization, and protects liver vasculature from axitinib-dependent toxicity. CONCLUSION: Overall, we found that NAC co-treatment allows vessel normalization in brain tumor vessels and exerts a protective effect on liver vasculature, therefore minimizing axitinib-dependent toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone or androgen production in male mammals. The blood-testis barrier (BTB) maintains structural integrity and safeguards germ cells from harmful substances by blocking their entry into the seminiferous tubules. L-cysteine is essential to the production of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant crucial to protecting against oxidative stress-induced damage. Animal studies have demonstrated the protective effect of L-cysteine in preventing testicular damage caused by chemicals or radiation. This study examines whether L-cysteine enhances the expression of testosterone biosynthesis and the BTB genes in human Leydig cells and THP-1 monocytes. The Leydig cells and THP-1 monocytes were treated with L-cysteine for 24 h. RNA was extracted following treatment, and the gene expression was analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. Testosterone levels in the cell supernatant were measured using an ELISA kit. L-cysteine treatment in Leydig cells significantly upregulated the expression of CYP11A1 (p = 0.03) and the BTB genes CLDN1 (p = 0.03), CLDN11 (p = 0.02), and TJP1 (p = 0.02). Similarly, L-cysteine significantly upregulated the expression of CYP11A1 (p = 0.03) and CYP19A1 (p < 0.01), and the BTB genes CLDN1 (p = 0.04), CLDN2 (p < 0.01), CLDN4 (p < 0.01), CLDN11 (p < 0.01), and TJP1 (p = 0.03) in THP-1 monocytes. Further, L-cysteine supplementation increased the testosterone secretion levels in human Leydig cells. The findings suggest that L-cysteine supplementation could be used as an adjuvant therapy to promote the integrity of the BTB genes, testosterone biosynthesis and secretion, and the maintenance of testicular functions, which in turn mitigates the risk of male infertility.",

This study investigated the effect of 4.5 kJ/m2 ultraviolet (UV)-C radiation and 2.0 g/L L-cysteine (L-cys) treatment on storage quality and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in lily bulbs. The combined UV-C/L-cys treatment inhibited the increase in decay rate, weight loss, ∆E⁎ and reducing sugar content; delayed the decrease of firmness and starch content; retained aromatic volatile compounds; and reduced pungent compounds. UV-C/L-cys treatment reduced H2O2 content, O2 ·- production rate, lipoxygenase activity and malondialdehyde content by maintaining high ROS-scavenging enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) activities and substances (total phenolic and ascorbic acid) levels, thereby protecting mitochondrial structure. Mantel test indicated that post-harvest quality and volatile compounds were closely related to ROS metabolism. Hence, UV-C/L-cys treatment can efficiently delay lily bulb senescence by reducing ROS accumulation during storage."

      "abstract": "Diabetes, a metabolic disease associated with an increased health care burden and mortality, is currently on the rise. Both upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and decreased levels of vitamin D (VD) and l-cysteine (LC) have been associated with diabetes. The overactivation of mTOR leads to insulin desensitization and metabolic dysfunction including uncontrolled hyperglycemia. This review summarizes various studies that have shown an inhibitory effect of VD or LC on mTOR activity. Findings from preclinical studies suggest that optimizing the VD and LC status in patients with diabetes can result in mTOR suppression, which has the potential to protect these individuals from microvascular and macrovascular complications while enhancing the regulation of their blood glucose. Given this information, finding ways to suppress mTOR signaling and also increasing VD and LC status is a possible therapeutic approach that might aid patients with diabetes. Future clinical trials are needed to investigate whether VD and LC co-supplementation can successfully downregulate mTOR and can be used as adjuvant therapy in patients with diabetes.",

Whey protein is rich in l-cysteine (LC) which is the precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), enhances glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, and promotes positive nitrogen balance. Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were used as a model in this study to examine the hypothesis that LC supplementation enhances blood levels of H2S and nitrite (NO2) and reduces inflammation biomarkers. Rats were gavaged daily (orally) with either saline placebo or LC along with a high-calorie diet starting at 6 wk of age. Fasting blood levels showed LC supplementation significantly increased circulatory levels of H2S and NO2 compared with placebo rats. LC supplementation increased plasma concentration of 25(OH)VD and vitamin C and lowered leptin and BW gain in ZDF rats. Furthermore, to assess the effect of H2S and NO2 in raising 25(OH)VD levels, the in vitro effect of H2S/NO2 on vitamin D metabolism genes was examined using THP-1 monocytes. The exogenous H2S and NO2 treatment upregulated the relative expression of CYP2R1 and CYP27B1 genes in cultured monocytes. This study suggests a potential mechanism for the observed increase in circulating 25(OH)VD levels following LC supplementation.",

Existing evidence illustrates that individuals with MetS have a 30%-40% higher chance of acquiring type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), or both. This study was undertaken to uncover the regulatory role of natural organosulfur compounds (OSCs), S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC), and S-ethyl-L-cysteine (SEC), in targeting high carbohydrate high fat (HCHF)-diet-induced MetS-associated risk management. Our findings suggested that SAC and SEC ameliorated HCHF-diet-induced diabetic profiles, plasma lipid and lipoprotein level, liver function, oxidative-stress, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), lipid peroxidation, plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK-9), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Moreover, the assessment of the hepatic mRNA expression of the key genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis depicted that SAC and SEC downregulated the PCSK-9 mRNA expression via targeting the expression of HNF-1α, a transcriptional activator of PCSK-9. On the other hand, the LDL-receptor (LDL-R) expression was upregulated through the activation of its transcriptional regulator sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). In addition, the activity and the mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductases (HMG-R) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) were also improved by the treatment of SAC and SEC. We concluded that SAC and SEC can protect against MetS via improving the lipid and lipoprotein content, glycemic indices, hepatic function, targeting the inflammatory cascades, and oxidative imbalance, regulation of the mRNA expression of PCSK-9, LDL-R, SREBP-2, HNF-1α, PPARs, and inflammatory biomarkers."

Then Hg2+ could quench the fluorescence of the 4-MBA@PVP-CuNCs and its fluorescence was restored with the addition of NAC. Based on the above principles, an off-on switching system was established to detect NAC. That is, the 4-MBA@PVP-CuNCs-Hg probe was prepared by adding Hg2+ to switch off the fluorescence of the CuNCs by static quenching, and then NAC was added to switch on the fluorescence of the probe based on the chelation of NAC and Hg2+. Moreover, the effects of metal ion types and mercury ion doses for the probe construction were also further discussed. The method showed excellent linearity in the range of 0.05-1.25 µM and low detection limit of 16 nM. Meanwhile, good recoveries in real urine, tablets and pellets were observed, which proved the reliability of the method and provided a convenient, fast and sensitive method for NAC detection.",

Therefore, the development of novel treatment strategies that can diminish the side effects of the long-term use of hormone-based drugs has been emphasized. S-Allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) is the major constituent of aged garlic extracts. Although the therapeutic effects resulting from the antioxidant properties of SAC have been extensively studied in inflammatory diseases, the therapeutic efficacy of SAC in endometriosis has not been described. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of SAC for endometriosis using a mouse model. METHODS: An endometriosis mouse model was surgically induced, and oral treatment with 30 mg/kg SAC was administered daily for 28 days. The development of endometriotic lesions was assessed by histological analysis, and the expression profiles of adhesion-, apoptosis-, and inflammation-related genes were evaluated by PCR. Flow cytometric analysis of mouse spleen was conducted to assess changes in lymphocyte subpopulations. RESULTS: SAC treatment significantly inhibited endometriotic lesion growth. Transcriptional expression analysis revealed the antiadhesion and apoptosis-promoting effects of SAC. In particular, SAC showed an effective immune modulatory response by altering splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets and inflammatory cytokine production in the spleen and endometriotic lesions. CONCLUSION: This study newly elucidates the inhibitory effects of SAC on the growth of endometriosis in a mouse model and describes its immunomodulatory effects.",

Enzymes such as cystathionine beta-synthase and sulfurtransferases like thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, and cystathionine gamma-lyase play a vital role in cellular sulfur metabolism. These enzymes are essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis, providing robust antioxidant defenses, and supporting cell division. Numerous studies have demonstrated that cancerous processes can alter the expression and activity of these enzymes, uncovering potential vulnerabilities or molecular targets for cancer therapy. Recent laboratory research has indicated that certain leukemia cell lines may exhibit significant changes in the expression patterns of these enzymes. Analysis of the scientific literature and online datasets has confirmed variations in sulfur enzyme function in specific leukemic cell lines compared to normal leukocytes. This comprehensive review collects and analyzes available information on sulfur enzymes in normal and leukemic cell lines, providing valuable insights and identifying new research pathways in this field.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin D receptors are expressed in many organs and tissues, which suggests that vitamin D (VD) affects physiological functions beyond its role in maintaining bone health. Deficiency or inadequacy of 25(OH)VD is widespread globally. Population studies demonstrate that a positive association exists between a high incidence of VD deficiency and a high incidence of chronic diseases, including dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. However, many subjects have difficulty achieving the required circulating levels of 25(OH)VD even after high-dose VD supplementation, and randomized controlled clinical trials have reported limited therapeutic success post-VD supplementation. Thus, there is a discordance between the benefits of VD supplementation and the prevention of chronic diseases in those with VD deficiency. Why this dissociation exists is currently under debate and is of significant public interest. This review discusses the downregulation of VD-metabolizing genes needed to convert consumed VD into 25(OH)VD to enable its metabolic action exhibited by subjects with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and other chronic diseases. Research findings indicate a positive correlation between the levels of 25(OH)VD and glutathione (GSH) in both healthy and diabetic individuals. Cell culture and animal experiments reveal a novel mechanism through which the status of GSH can positively impact the expression of VD metabolism genes. This review highlights that for better success, VD deficiency needs to be corrected at multiple levels: (i) VD supplements and/or VD-rich foods need to be consumed to provide adequate VD, and (ii) the body needs to be able to upregulate VD-metabolizing genes to convert VD into 25(OH)VD and then to 1,25(OH)2VD to enhance its metabolic action. This review outlines the association between 25(OH)VD deficiency/inadequacy and decreased GSH levels, highlighting the positive impact of combined VD+LC supplementation on upregulating GSH, VD-metabolizing genes, and VDR. These effects have the potential to enhance 25(OH)VD levels and its therapeutic efficacy.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of novel targeted agents for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an important research landscape due to the limited efficacy, side effects and drug resistance of current treatment options. Among many repurposed drugs, disulphiram (DSF) has shown the potential to target tumours. However, its unpleasant neurotoxicity greatly limits its use. A DSF derivative, S-(N,N-diethyldithiocarbamoyl)-N-acetyl-l-cysteine (DS-NAC), was synthesised against NSCLC. The therapeutic effects, mechanism and toxicities of DS-NAC were evaluated in A549 and H460 cells and the mouse model of in situ lung cancer. The in vitro results exhibited that DS-NAC had potent anti-proliferation, apoptotic, anti-metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inhibition effects. In the orthotopic lung cancer mouse model, therapeutic effects of DS-NAC were better than those of DSF and were similar to docetaxel (DTX). Also, results from western blot and immunohistochemistry showed that DS-NAC in combination with copper exerted therapeutic effects via regulating NF-κB signalling pathway and ROS-related proteins such as HIF-1α, Nrf2 and PKC-δ rather than regulating ROS level directly. Moreover, the safety evaluation study showed that DS-NAC had low haematologic and hepatic toxicities in comparison with DTX as well as low neurological toxicity compared with DSF. DS-NAC could be a promising anti-lung cancer agent with a favourable safety profile.",

In this investigation, we synthesized a set of S-benzyl-L-cysteine-based CDPs (designated as P1-P6) and thoroughly examined their self-assembly behavior in a methanol-water solvent to elucidate the relationship between their structure and gelation properties. The hydrophobicity of the amino acids within the CDPs was gradually increased. The present study employed a comprehensive array of analytical techniques, including NMR, FT-IR, AFM, thioflavin-T, congo-red CD, X-ray crystallography, and biophysical calculations like Hirshfield Surface analysis and DFT analysis. These methods revealed that in addition to hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid side chain significantly influences the propensity of CDPs to form hydrogels. Each CDP yielded distinct nanofibrillar networks rich in β-sheet structures, showcasing unique morphological features. Moreover, we explored the practical application of these CDP-based hydrogels in water purification by utilizing them to remove harmful organic dyes from contaminated water. This application underscores the potential of CDPs in addressing environmental challenges, offering a promising avenue for the future development of these materials in water treatment technologies.",

However, knowledge of its pharmacokinetics (PK) in this avian species is very limited. Therefore, the study aimed to shed more light on the PK properties of NAC in chickens. Broilers were subjected to single intravenous (i.v.) or oral (p.o.) treatment or multiple NAC administrations via the feed. Drug concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS, and the data were subjected to non-compartmental analysis and modeled by non-linear mixed effect approach. NAC was eliminated in a short time after i.v. treatment, with a t 1/2el of 0.93 (0.59-2.09) h. It showed limited distribution with population mean of volumes of distribution in the central and peripheral compartments V 1 of 0.148 L/kg and V 2 of 0.199 L/kg, respectively, and V darea of 0.39 (0.258-0.635) L/kg. The value of MRT was 1.76 h (range of 0.96-2.69, p < .05) after single p.o. treatment, indicating a twofold increase if compared to i.v. administration (0.87 h, 0.55-1.78). Both methods of Pk analysis revealed very limited bioavailability, <10%. Feeding behavior led to a later achievement of lower maximum plasma concentrations (5.74, range of 3.44-9.32 μg/mL, p < .05), which were maintained during the 5 days of treatment.",

      "abstract": "S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) is a sulfur compound present in fresh garlic. The reference literature describes its anticancer, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Breast cancer is infamously known as one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies among women worldwide. Its morbidity and mortality make it reasonable to complete and expand knowledge on this cancer's characteristics. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and its naturally occurring donors are well-known investigation subjects for diverse therapeutic purposes. This study was conducted to investigate the SAC antiproliferative potential and effect on three enzymes involved in H2S metabolism: 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH), and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS). We chose the in vitro cellular model of human breast adenocarcinomas: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The expression of enzymes after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h incubation with 2.24 mM, 3.37 mM, and 4.50 mM SAC concentrations was examined. The number of living cells was determined by the MTS assay. Changes in cellular plasma membrane integrity were measured by the LDH test. Expression changes at the protein level were analyzed using Western blot. A significant decrease in viable cells was registered for MCF-7 cells after all incubation times upon 4.50 mM SAC exposure, and after 6 and 24 h only in MDA-MB-231 upon 4.50 mM SAC. In both cell lines, the MPST gene expression significantly increased after the 24 h incubation with 4.50 mM SAC. S-allyl-L-cysteine had opposite effects on changes in CTH and CBS expression in both cell lines. In our research model, we confirmed the antiproliferative potential of SAC and concluded that our studies provided current information about the increase in MPST gene expression mediated by S-allyl-L-cysteine in the adenocarcinoma in vitro cellular model for the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Further investigation of this in vitro model can bring useful information regarding sulfur enzyme metabolism of breast adenocarcinoma and regulating its activity and expression (gene silencing) in anticancer therapy.",

The apparent reaction rate of the LBCBa-2/PMS/ATZ system with ultrasonic was 2.87 times that without ultrasonic.

For that, normal male Wistar rats (60 days old) were fed for 21 days with 10% sucrose in their drinking water and 5 days of NAC administration (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and thereafter, we determined: serum glucose, insulin, transaminases, uric acid, and triglyceride levels; hepatic fructokinase and glucokinase activities, glycogen content, lipogenic gene expression; enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidative stress, insulin signaling pathway, and inflammatory markers. Results showed that alterations evinced in sucrose-fed rats (hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and high liver fructokinase activity together with increased liver lipogenic gene expression and oxidative stress and inflammatory markers) were prevented by NAC administration. P-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P-eNOS)/eNOS and pAKT/AKT ratios, decreased by sucrose ingestion, were restored after NAC treatment. In conclusion, the results suggest that NAC administration improves glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in prediabetic rats probably mediated by modulation of the AKT/NOS pathway. Administration of NAC may be an effective complementary strategy to alleviate or prevent oxidative stress and inflammatory responses observed in type 2 diabetes at early stages of its development (prediabetes).",

      "abstract": "Hypothermic liquid storage at 4-5 °C has emerged as a novel approach for preserving boar semen, offering innovative possibilities for semen preservation. However, this method also presents challenges, including cold shock and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Therefore, reducing oxidative damage induced by low temperatures becomes essential while supplementing appropriate protectants. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) compared to Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and Skim Milk Powder (SMP) in maintaining boar sperm motility and progressive motility using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Among the tested concentrations, 4 g/L of BSA exhibited the best protective effect. Subsequently, we supplemented different concentrations of l-cysteine (LC) and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) as additives in the presence of BSA as a protectant. Our results demonstrated that 1 mmol/L of LC and 0.5 mmol/L of NAC exhibited superior protection of sperm quality compared to other concentrations. Furthermore, the 1 mmol/L LC and 0.5 mmol/L NAC groups showed significantly improved plasma membrane integrity and acrosome integrity compared to the control group. These groups also exhibited enhanced antioxidant capacity, evidenced by increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP production, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and GPX-4 levels. Additionally, they demonstrated decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as reduced oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and glutathione reductase (GR) levels. Furthermore, LC and NAC treatment enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. However, inhibiting AMPK using compound C did not inhibit the protective effects of LC and NAC on low-temperature preserved boar sperm. These findings suggest that 4 g/L BSA can serve as an effective protectant for hypothermic liquid storage of boar semen. Additionally, LC and NAC supplementation reduces oxidative damage by enhancing antioxidant capacity rather than through AMPK-mediated ATP supplementation. These results contribute to advancing the application of LC and NAC in hypothermic liquid storage of boar semen.",

      "abstract": "The volume collapse and slow kinetics reaction of anode materials are two key issues for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, an \"embryo\" strategy is proposed for synthesis of nanorod-embedded MoO2/MoS2/C network nanoarchitecture as anode for SIBs with high-rate performance. Interestingly, L-cysteine which plays triple roles including sulfur source, reductant, and carbon source can be utilized to produce the sulfur vacancy-enriched heterostructure. Specifically, L-cysteine can combine with metastable monoclinic MoO3 nanorods at room temperature to encapsulate the \"nutrient\" of MoOx analogues (MoO2.5(OH)0.5 and MoO3·0.5H2O) and hydrogen-deficient L-cysteine in the \"embryo\" precursor affording for subsequent in situ multistep heating treatment. The resultant MoO2/MoS2/C presents a high-rate capability of 875 and 420 mAh g-1 at 0.5 and 10 A g-1, respectively, which are much better than the MoS2-based anode materials reported by far. Finite element simulation and analysis results verify that the volume expansion can be reduced to 42.8% from 88.8% when building nanorod-embedded porous network structure. Theoretical calculations reveal that the sulfur vacancies and heterointerface engineering can promote the adsorption and migration of Na+ leading to highly enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic reaction. The work provides an efficient approach to develop advanced electrode materials for energy storage."

As such, greater understanding of their measurements within foods is important to estimate intake in humans and to inform dietary intervention studies. Herein is described a simple and sensitive method for simultaneous analysis of 20 GLS, SFN and SMCSO by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Analytes were effectively retained and resolved on an Xbridge C18 column. Detection can be achieved using high resolution or unit resolution mass spectrometry; the latter making the method more applicable to large studies. Quantitative analysis using calibration standards was demonstrated for 10 GLS, SFN and SMCSO. A further 10 GLS were tentatively identified using high resolution mass spectrometry. The use of surrogate GLS standards was shown to be unreliable, with closely related GLS displaying significantly different ionisation efficiencies."

Chiral carbon dots (CDs) are promising nanoparticles for sensing and bioimaging since they are biocompatible, ecofriendly, and free from toxic elements. Herein, green and red emissive chiral CDs are fabricated via surface modification treatment of achiral CDs at room temperature. After modification with l-cysteine molecules, the treated CDs demonstrate an intense chiral signal in the region of 200-300 nm with a dissymmetry factor up to 2.3 × 10-4 and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 19% and 15% for green and red emission bands, respectively. These CDs preserve their chiral signal in different ion systems, such as those with pH changes or in the presence of metal ions, along with remarkably low cytotoxicity, making them potential candidates for use as photoluminescent labels for biological objects.",

However, these processes are limited by the sluggish Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox circulation efficiency. In this study, L-cysteine (L-Cys), an environmentally friendly electron donor, was applied to enhance the Fe3O4/PAA process for the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) abatement. Surprisingly, the L-Cys incorporation was found not only to enhance the SMX degradation rate constant by 3.2 times but also to switch the Fe(IV) dominated nonradical pathway into the •OH dominated radical pathway. Experiment and theoretical calculation result elucidated -NH2, -SH, and -COOH of L-Cys can increase Fe solubilization by binding to the Fe sites of Fe3O4, while -SH of L-Cys can promote the reduction of bounded/dissolved Fe(III). Similar SMX conversion pathways driven by the Fe3O4/PAA process with or without L-Cys were revealed. Excessive L-Cys or PAA, high pH and the coexisting HCO3-/H2PO4- exhibit inhibitory effects on SMX degradation, while Cl- and humic acid barely affect the SMX removal. This work advances the knowledge of the enhanced mechanism insights of L-Cys toward heterogeneous Fenton (-like) processes and provides experimental data for the efficient treatment of sulfonamide antibiotics in the water treatment.",

Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been considered as emerging and promising adsorbents for the removal of many types of pollutants. In this work, a novel and selective adsorbent (Cys-AuNPs@COF) was prepared by embedding gold nanoparticles functionalized with L-cysteine in melamine-based COF for the removal of Cr(VI) ions from wastewater. The synthesized Cys-AuNPs@COF were characterizedby Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and elemental mapping (EMA) analysis. The removal of Cr(VI) ions was performed using a batch mode process by taking advantage of response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design (CCD) model. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cys-AuNPs@COF was 151.5 mg g-1. The experimental results followed the Langmuir model and showed pseudo-second-order kinetics. A portable, low-cost, and highly sensitive device with a smartphone colorimeter platform was developed for in situ measurement of trace amounts of chromium (VI) ions. Due to its simplicity and versatility, this method has the potential to serve as an alternative to conventional field analysis methods."

Current study explores the potential of NAC-loaded niosomes (NAC-NIO) for tumor treatment in mice. NAC-loaded niosomes' efficiency, morphology, UV absorption, size distribution, zeta potential, release, and FTIR analysis were evaluated. For vivo study, 25 male BALB/c mice were divided to five groups: gp1 negative control (receive saline), gp2 positive control (tumor group), gp3 treated with NAC, gp4 treated with NAC-NIO at the same time of tumor injection, and gp5 treated with NAC-NIO after tumor growth (day 14). The impact of NAC-NIO on the tumor treatment was evaluated by measuring tumor size progress, comet assay, oxidative stress parameters (GSH, nitric oxide, MDA), western blot analysis, and histopathological investigation of tissues. NAC-NIO showed 72 ± 3% encapsulation efficiency and zeta potential - 5.95 mV with spherical shape. It was found that oral administration of NAC-NIO in a dose of 50 mg/kg provided significant protection against tumor cells. Our formulation decreases DNA injury significantly (P < 0.05). It was noticed that NAC-NIO can increase oxidative stress levels in tumor tissue. On the other hand, the caspase 3 and caspase 9 gene expression were upregulated significantly (P < 0.001) in mice administrated NAC-NIO compared with all other groups. Histological studies confirmed the protective effect of NAC-NIO against tumor especially for treatment during tumor growth protocol. The results suggested that oral delivery of NAC-NIO formulation improved antioxidant effect.",

METHODOLOGY: Fourty-eight Wistar albino rats were divided into six groups: (1) Control group, (2) ADR group (1 mg/kg/day ip for 10 days), (3) AP Group (1st mandibular molar tooth), (4) AP + ADR Group, (5) AP + NAC group (150 mg/kg/day ip), and (6) AP + ADR + NAC group. After 3 weeks, the rats were decapitated and blood and tissue samples (heart, kidney, and jaw) were collected. Tissue samples were evaluated by biochemical (inflammatory cytokines and hemodynamic parameters) and radiological analyses. One-way anova with Tukey post hoc tests was used to compare data, considering p < .05 as statistically significant. RESULTS: The serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, BUN, Creatinine, CK, and LDH were elevated in the test groups compared with the control group, and treatment with NAC reduced these levels (p < .05). Heart and kidney tissue analysis showed a higher heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) and kidney-to-body weight ratio (KW/BW) in the test groups compared with the control group (p < .05). No significant differences in HW/BW and KW/BW were found between the control and AP + NAC groups. Volumetric apical bone resorption analysis showed an increase in periapical radiolucencies in AP-induced groups indicating apical periodontitis. NAC treatment reduced the total area and volume of resorption cavities (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that NAC's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects can reduce adriamycin-mediated heart and kidney damage and may have a positive effect on apical periodontitis in individuals with nephropathy and cardiomyopathy.",

Reducing temperature, however, can lead to cold shock damage and oxidative stress in boar semen. This study verified the effect of L-cysteine on the quality of semen stored at 5 °C for 120 h. Twenty-one normospermic ejaculates were diluted in Beltsville Thawing Solution into five treatments: Positive control (Pos_Cont, storage at 17 °C without L-cysteine) and groups with 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mmol/L of L-cysteine supplementation stored at 5 °C. Variables were analyzed as repeated measures, considering treatment, storage time, and interaction as main factors. The effects of different L-cysteine concentrations were also evaluated using polynomial orthogonal contrasts. Sperm motility and pH were higher in the Pos_Cont compared to the groups stored at 5 °C (P < 0.05). In polynomial orthogonal contrast models, total motility was affected by the interaction between L-cysteine and storage time (P = 0.04), with a linear increase in motility when increasing the amount of L-cysteine at 72 and 120 h. Progressive motility increased quadratically as the L-cysteine reached 1 mmol/L (P < 0.01). In the thermoresistance test at 120 h, sperm motility increased quadratically up to an L-cysteine dose of 1 mmol/L (P < 0.05). Sulfhydryl content linearly increased with L-cysteine supplementation (P = 0.01), with no effect on intracellular ROS and sperm lipid peroxidation (P ≥ 0.06) in 5ºC-stored doses. In conclusion, L-cysteine supplementation has a positive effect on sperm motility up to 120 h of storage at 5 °C.",

Therefore, there is a large and urgent need for the development of new, smart antibacterial agents able to efficiently kill or inhibit bacterial growth. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of S, N-doped Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) as a light-triggered antibacterial agent. Gamma irradiation was employed as a tool to achieve one-step modification of GQDs in the presence of L-cysteine amino acid as a source of heteroatoms. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and zeta potential measurements provided the necessary data to clarify the structure of modified dots and verify the introduction of both S- and N-atoms in GQDs structure, but also severe changes in the aromatic, sp2 domains. Namely, γ-irradiation caused a bonding of S atoms in 1.14 at.% mainly as thiol groups, and N in 1.81 at.% as amino groups, but sp2 contribution in GQD structure was lowered from 63.00 to 4.86 at.%, as measured in dots irradiated at a dose of 200 kGy. Fluorescence quenching measurements showed that L-cysteine-modified dots are able to bind to human serum albumin. The antibacterial activity of GQDs combined with 1 and 6 h of blue light (470 nm) irradiation was tested against 8 bacterial strains. GQD-cys-25 sample provided the best results, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) as low as 125 μg/mL against S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli after only 1 h of blue light exposure.",

In addition to conventional antimicrobial therapy, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and propolis are dietary supplements that are often recommended as supportive therapy for upper respiratory tract infections. However, no data on the beneficial effect of their combination against bacterial biofilms can be found in the scientific literature. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the in vitro effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and dry propolis extract in fixed combinations (NAC/dry propolis extract fixed combination) on biofilm formation by bacterial species isolated from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic otitis media, and chronic adenoiditis. The prospective study included 48 adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, 29 adults with chronic otitis media, and 33 children with chronic adenoiditis. Bacteria were isolated from tissue samples obtained intraoperatively and identified using the MALDI-TOF Vitek MS System. The antimicrobial activity, synergism, and antibiofilm effect of NAC/dry propolis extract fixed combination were studied in vitro. A total of 116 different strains were isolated from the tissue samples, with staphylococci being the most frequently isolated in all patients (57.8%). MICs of the NAC/dry propolis extract fixed combination ranged from 1.25/0.125 to 20/2 mg NAC/mg propolis. A synergistic effect (FICI ≤ 0.5) was observed in 51.7% of strains. The majority of isolates from patients with chronic otitis media were moderate biofilm producers and in chronic adenoiditis they were weak biofilm producers, while the same number of isolates in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were weak and moderate biofilm producers. Subinhibitory concentrations of the NAC/propolis combination ranging from 0.625-0.156 mg/mL to 10-2.5 mg/mL of NAC combined with 0.062-0.016 mg/mL to 1-0.25 mg/mL of propolis inhibited biofilm formation in all bacterial strains. Suprainhibitory concentrations ranging from 2.5-10 mg/mL to 40-160 mg/mL of NAC in combination with 0.25-1 mg/mL to 4-16 mg/mL of propolis completely eradicated the biofilm. In conclusion, the fixed combination of NAC and dry propolis extract has a synergistic effect on all stages of biofilm formation and eradication of the formed biofilm in bacteria isolated from upper respiratory tract infections."

Hypoxia in WM115 and WM266-4 cells was confirmed by induced expression of carbonic anhydrase IX and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 by the RT-PCR and Western blot methods. It was shown that, under hypoxic conditions the inhibition of WM115 and WM266-4 melanoma cell proliferation was associated with decreased expression of thioredoxin reductase-1 and cystathionine β-synthase. These two enzymes may be important therapeutic targets in the treatment of melanoma. Interestingly, it was also found that in normoxia the expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in metastatic WM266-4 melanoma cells was significantly higher than in primary melanoma WM115 cells.",

      "abstract": "The future trend in achieving precision medicine involves the development of non-invasive cancer biomarker sensors that offer high accuracy, low cost, and time-saving benefits for risk clarification, early detection, disease detection, and therapeutic monitoring. A facile approach for the synthesis of MoO3 nanosheets was developed by thermally oxidizing MoS2 nanosheets in air followed by thermal annealing. Subsequently, Au@MnO2 nanocomposites were prepared using a combined hydrothermal process and in situ chemical synthesis. In this study, we present a novel immunosensor design strategy involving the immobilization of antiHSP70 antibodies on Au@MnO2/MoO3 nanocomposites modified on a screen-printed electrode (SPE) using EDC/NHS chemistry. This study establishes HSP70 as a potential biomarker for monitoring therapeutic response during anticancer therapy. Impedance measurements of HSP70 on the Au@MnO2/MoO3/SPE immunosensor using EIS showed an increase in impedance with an increase in HSP70 concentration. The electrochemical immunosensor demonstrated a good linear response in the range of 0.001 to 1000 ng mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.17 pg mL-1 under optimal conditions. Moreover, the immunosensor was effective in detecting HSP70 at low concentrations in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line following Paclitaxel treatment, indicating its potential for early detection of the HSP70 biomarker in organ-on-a-chip and clinical applications."

L-Cysteine hydrochloride (L-CH) is a food additive often used as a fruit and vegetable preservative and also to approved bread consistency. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of L-CH as an antimicrobial on the growth of Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus) and AFB1 biosynthesis. L-CH significantly inhibited A. flavus mycelial growth, affected mycelial morphology and AFB1 synthesis. Furthermore, L-CH induced glutathione (GSH) synthesis which scavenged intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). RNA-Seq indicated that L-CH inhibited hyphal branching, and spore and sclerotia formation by controlling cell wall and spore development-related genes. Activation of the GSH metabolic pathway eliminated intracellular ROS, leading to hyphal dwarfing. L-CH treatment downregulated most of the Aflatoxin (AF) cluster genes and aflS, aflR, AFLA_091090 transcription factors. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of L-CH control of A. flavus and AFB1 foundation. We believe that L-CH could be used as a food additive to control AFB1 in foods and also in the environment.",

      "abstract": "Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a known human carcinogen with toxicity attributed to its metabolism. S-(1,2-Dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC) is a metabolite of TCE formed downstream in TCE glutathione (GSH) conjugation and is upstream of several toxic metabolites. Despite knowledge that DCVC stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis in placental cells, the extent to which these outcomes are attributable to DCVC metabolism is unknown. The current study used N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) at 5 mM and aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) at 1 mM as pharmacological modifiers of DCVC metabolism to investigate DCVC toxicity at concentrations of 5-50 µM in the human placental trophoblast BeWo cell model capable of forskolin-stimulated syncytialization. Exposures of unsyncytialized BeWo cells, BeWo cells undergoing syncytialization, and syncytialized BeWo cells were studied. NAC pre/co-treatment with DCVC either failed to inhibit or exacerbated DCVC-induced H2O2 abundance, PRDX2 mRNA expression, and BCL2 mRNA expression. Although NAC increased mRNA expression of CYP3A4, which would be consistent with increased generation of the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-DCVC sulfoxide (NAcDCVCS), a CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly alter BeWo cell responses. Moreover, AOAA failed to inhibit cysteine conjugate β-lyase (CCBL), which bioactivates DCVC, and did not affect the percentage of nuclei condensed or fragmented, a measure of apoptosis, in all BeWo cell models. However, syncytialized cells had higher CCBL activity compared to unsyncytialized cells, suggesting that the former may be more sensitive to DCVC toxicity. Together, although neither NAC nor AOAA mitigated DCVC toxicity, differences in CCBL activity and potentially CYP3A4 expression dictated the differential toxicity derived from DCVC.",

Hemolysis was determined photometrically, and intracellular glutathione [GSH]i from high performance liquid chromatography.Results: Desipramine dose-dependently significantly enhanced the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells and didn´t impact glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Desipramine-induced eryptosis was significantly reversed by pre-treatment of erythrocytes with either nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). The highest inhibitory effect was obtained by using both inhibitors together. Calcium (Ca2+) depletion aggravated desipramine-induced eryptosis. Changing the order of treatment, i.e. desipramine first followed by inhibitors, could not influence the inhibitory effect of SNP or NAC.Conclusion: Antidepressants-caused intoxication can be treated by SNP and NAC, respectively.

      "abstract": "Sichuan is the China's leading producer of loquat, with the largest cultivation area and yield ranked first in China. Loquat is a seasonal fruit highly appreciated by consumers; however, the fruit is prone to browning and lignification after harvest, affecting its storage quality. The effects of L-Cysteine (L-Cys, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2%) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1%) on the sensory quality and antioxidant activity of loquat fruit during cold storage at 4 °C for 35 days and simulated shelf life for 5 days were investigated. The results showed that after 40 days of storage, compared with the control, 0.05% L-Cys and 0.05% GABA treatment of 'Zaozhong No. 6' loquat fruit effectively reduced the weight loss rate, browning index, decay index, respiratory rate, firmness, and lignin content and slowed the decreases in total soluble solids, soluble sugar, titratable acidityand vitamin C contents. The application of 0.05% L-Cys and 0.05% GABA significantly increased the contents of total phenols, total flavonoids, flavanols, and carotenoids; delayed the increase of relative electric conductivity, MDA, POD, and PPO activities; and significantly enhanced the activities of SOD and CAT, DPPH free radical scavenging ability, and FRAP, thereby improving antioxidant capacity. In summary, 0.05% L-Cys and 0.05% GABA treatment promotes the quality of loquat fruit after 40 days of storage, and significantly enhances antioxidant capacity, thus delaying senescence after harvest.",

In this work, the synthesized α-Fe2O3-pillared bentonite (FPB) was used to degrade acetamiprid in the photo-Fenton process with the assistance of L-cysteine (L-cys) existing in natural aquatic environment. The kinetic constant k of acetamiprid degradation by FPB/L-cys in the photo-Fenton process was far more than that in the Fenton process of FPB/L-cys lacking light and the photo-Fenton process of FPB without L-cys. The positive linear correlation between k and ≡Fe(II) content indicated the synergy of L-cys and visible light accelerated the cycle of Fe(III) to Fe(II) in FPB/L-cys during the degradation of acetamiprid by elevating the visible light response of FPB, and promoting the interfacial electron transfer from the active sites of FPB to hydrogen peroxide and photo-generated electron transfer from conduction band of α-Fe2O3 to the active sites of FPB. The boosting •OH and 1O2 were predominantly responsible for acetamiprid degradation. Acetamiprid could be efficiently degraded into less toxic small molecules in the photo-Fenton process via C-N bond breaking, hydroxylation, demethylation, ketonization, dechlorination, and ring cleavage.",

      "abstract": "L-Cysteine, widely used in medicine and the food industry, is of great essentiality to organisms and the food quality. Given that current detection approaches require exacting lab conditions and tedious sample treatment, there is a pressing demand for developing a method that possesses advantages of user friendliness, prominent performance, and cost-effectiveness. Herein, a self-cascade system was developed for the fluorescence detection of L-cysteine based on the ingenious performance of Ag nanoparticle/single-walled carbon nanotube nanocomposites (AgNP/SWCNTs) and DNA-templated Ag nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs). The fluorescence of DNA-AgNCs could be quenched on account of the adsorption of DNA-AgNCs on AgNP/SWCNTs by π-π stacking. With the cooperation of Fe2+, AgNP/SWCNTs with oxidase and peroxidase-like activities could catalyze the oxidation of L-cysteine to produce cystine and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and then break the O-O bond of H2O2 to generate a hydroxyl radical (·OH), which could cleave the DNA strand into different sequence fragments which subsequently peeled off from the AgNP/SWCNTs, resulting in a \"turn-on\" fluorescence response. In this paper, AgNP/SWCNTs with multi-enzyme activities was synthesized enabling the reaction to proceed in just one step. The successful preliminary applications for the L-cysteine detection in pharmaceutical, juice beverage, and serum samples indicated that the developed method exhibited great potential in medical diagnosis, food monitoring, and the biochemical field, which also broadened the horizon for follow-up research.",

      "abstract": "Periodontitis is a type of chronic inflammatory oral disease characterized by the destruction of periodontal connective tissue and progressive alveolar bone resorption. As oxidative stress is the key cause of periodontitis in the early periodontal microenvironment, antioxidative therapy has been considered a viable treatment for periodontitis. However, more stable and effective reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging nanomedicines are still highly needed due to the instability of traditional antioxidants. Herein, a new type of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC)-derived red fluorescent carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) has been synthesized with excellent biocompatibility, which can serve as an extracellular antioxidant to scavenge ROS effectively. Moreover, NAC-CPDs can promote osteogenic differentiation in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) under H2 O2 stimulation. In addition, NAC-CPDs are capable of targeted accumulation in alveolar bone in vivo, reducing the level of alveolar bone resorption in periodontitis mice, as well as performing fluorescence imaging in vitro and in vivo. In terms of mechanism, NAC-CPDs may regulate redox homeostasis and promote bone formation in the periodontitis microenvironment by modulating the kelch-like ECH-associated protein l (Keap1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. This study provides a new strategy for the application of CPDs theranostic nanoplatform for periodontitis.",

However, more effective treatment for cervical cancer is needed. In this study, we aim to investigate whether N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could inhibit the proliferation of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cells, and reduce cervical carcinogenesis. METHODS: The cervical cancer cell lines SiHa, HeLa, HPV-negative cell line C33A, and the immortalized human cervical keratinocyte cells S12 were used. The protein expression was determined using Western blot assay. mRNA expression was determined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V-FITC apoptosis kits. The numbers of colonies were measured using colony-forming assay. Xenograft tumor necrosis and HPV16 E7 expression were determined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Our results showed that NAC treatment at the concentration of 1.5 mM significantly promoted cell apoptosis and reduced cell growth by inhibiting HPV16 E7 expression. NAC inhibited HPV16-oncoprotein-induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein expression and Akt activation in vitro. Additionally, NAC suppressed tumor growth, as evidenced by the smaller tumor size in the xenograft mouse model and decreased HPV16 E7 expression in tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that NAC exhibits the potential to promote HPV-positive cell apoptosis, and suppress the proliferation of HPV-positive cells by inhibiting cell inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 and HIF-1α.",

      "abstract": "The need of the synthesis of a new generation of medicines aimed at combating bacteria and biofilms that cause various infections is a great urgency. There has been a gradual decrease in the conventional techniques of treatment with the use of antibiotics. Consequently, much effort has focused on the search for new methods and approaches to obtain antibacterial drugs and determine their rational use such that microorganisms do not acquire resistance. Although silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have exhibited certain levels of effectiveness against multidrug-resistant bacteria and biofilms, there are very few simple, cheap and easy-to-scale methods to obtain AgNPs and AgNCs with well-desired characteristics. In this study, we carried out the one-pot synthesis of sols and gels containing AgNPs and AgNCs using only L-cysteine (CYS) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), as bioreducing/capping/gel-forming agents, and different silver salts - nitrate, nitrite and acetate. HRTEM, SAED, EDX mapping, AFM, SEM, EDX, ICP-MS and FTIR spectroscopy analysis confirmed the formation of spherical/elliptical CYS-AgNP and NAC-AgNC particles consisting of AgNPs or AgNCs \"core\" and CYS/Ag+ or NAC/Ag+ complexes \"shell\" with mean average diameters of 10 and 5 nm, respectively. UV-Vis spectroscopy fixed the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at 390-420 nm for the CYS-AgNPs systems and LSPR absence for the NAC-AgNCs ones. DLS and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) data indicated that the mean average diameter of the particles is about 80 nm for the CYS-AgNPs systems and 20 nm for the NAC-AgNCs ones. The Zeta potential measurements showed that the particles possess positive and negative charge values for CYS-AgNPs and NAC-AgNCs systems, respectively. The prepared materials demonstrated the high antibacterial activity against the most common types of bacteria at the MIC range of 10-100 μM, wherein the effect of the NAC-AgNCs systems is 2 times stronger than that of the CYS-AgNPs ones. Both systems are non-toxic or have low-toxicity at 300 μM for normal human cells: erytrocytes, fibroblasts and macrophages. Sols and hydrogels in the concentration range of 20-40 μM showed the complete inhibition of the formation of biofilms from Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which belong to the ESKAPE pathogenes group and represent the most serious problem in practical medicine. NAC-AgNCs systems were the most active. The simple strategy of the preparation of AgNP/AgNC-based sols and gels, along with their pronounced antibacterial and antibiofilm activity, could open new perspectives for its applications in medicine.",

      "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease, in which the major clinical manifestation includes hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension, and organs fibrosis. Clinically, treatment of schistosomiasis involves the use of praziquantel (PZQ) and supportive care, which does not improve the patient's outcome as liver injuries persist. Here, we report for the first time the effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and/or praziquantel (PQZ) on S. mansoni, hepatic granuloma, serum markers for liver function and oxidative damage in acute schistosomiasis. Infected mice were divided into control, NAC, PZQ and NAC+PZQ groups and uninfected into control and NAC groups. After infection, NAC (200 mg/kg/day) was administrated until the 60th day and PZQ (100 mg/kg/day) from the 45th to the 49th day, both orally. On day 61, the mice were euthanized for serum markers for liver function. Worms were recovered, fragments of intestine employed to ascertain the oviposition pattern, and the liver was used for histopathological analysis, histomorphometry, egg and granuloma counting and oxidative stress marker assays. NAC reduced the burden of worms and eggs and increased the dead eggs in intestinal tissue. NAC+PZQ brought about reduction in granulomatous infiltration and NAC and/or PZQ reduced levels of ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase and increased albumin. NAC, PZQ or NAC+PZQ reduced levels of the superoxide anion, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl and increased sulfhydryl groups. The reduction in parasitological parameters, granulomatous inflammation and oxy-redox imbalance suggests NAC acts as a adjuvant in treatment of acute experimental schistosomiasis."

      "abstract": "Syncytialization, the fusion of cytotrophoblasts into an epithelial barrier that constitutes the maternal-fetal interface, is a crucial event of placentation. This process is characterized by distinct changes to amino acid and energy metabolism. A metabolite of the industrial solvent trichloroethylene (TCE), S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC), modifies energy metabolism and amino acid abundance in HTR-8/SVneo extravillous trophoblasts. In the current study, we investigated DCVC-induced changes to energy metabolism and amino acids during forskolin-stimulated syncytialization in BeWo cells, a human villous trophoblastic cell line that models syncytialization in vitro. BeWo cells were exposed to forskolin at 100 μM for 48 h to stimulate syncytialization. During syncytialization, BeWo cells were also treated with DCVC at 0 (control), 10, or 20 μM. Following treatment, the targeted metabolomics platform, \"Tricarboxylic Acid Plus\", was used to identify changes in energy metabolism and amino acids. DCVC treatment during syncytialization decreased oleic acid, aspartate, proline, uridine diphosphate (UDP), UDP-d-glucose, uridine monophosphate, and cytidine monophosphate relative to forskolin-only treatment controls, but did not increase any measured metabolite. Notable changes stimulated by syncytialization in the absence of DCVC included increased adenosine monophosphate and guanosine monophosphate, as well as decreased aspartate and glutamate. Pathway analysis revealed multiple pathways in amino acid and sugar metabolisms that were altered with forskolin-stimulated syncytialization alone and DCVC treatment during syncytialization. Analysis of ratios of metabolites within the pathways revealed that DCVC exposure during syncytialization changed metabolite ratios in the same or different direction compared to syncytialization alone. Building off our oleic acid findings, we found that extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-2, which is downstream in oleic acid signaling, underwent the same changes as oleic acid. Together, the metabolic changes stimulated by DCVC treatment during syncytialization suggest changes in energy metabolism and amino acid abundance as potential mechanisms by which DCVC could impact syncytialization and pregnancy.",

Studies show that the effects of NAC are dose-dependent, and it appears that the efficient doses in vitro are usually higher than the achieved in vivo plasma concentrations. However, to date, the inconsistencies between the in vitro NAC antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in vitro effects, by reproducing the in vivo NAC plasma concentrations as well as high NAC concentrations. To do so, A549 were transfected with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly (I:C)) and treated with NAC at different treatment periods. Oxidative stress, release of proinflammatory mediators and NFkB activation were analyzed.

Important pathways activated owing to redox imbalance include taurine, hypotaurine and glutathione metabolism. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of these pathways during chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. METHODOLOGY: Using a dietary L-cysteine supplement system, we upregulated these pathways and evaluated oxidative damage and oxidative stress response upon CHIKV infection using protein carbonylation and GST assays. Further, using a dsRNA based approach, we silenced some of the genes involved in synthesis and transport of taurine and hypotaurine and then evaluated the impact of these genes on CHIKV infection and redox biology in the mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS: We report that CHIKV infection exerts oxidative stress in the A. aegypti, leading to oxidative damage and as a response, an elevated GST activity was observed. It was also observed that dietary L-cysteine treatment restricted CHIKV infection in A. aegypti mosquitoes. This L-cysteine mediated CHIKV inhibition was coincided by enhanced GST activity that further resulted in reduced oxidative damage during the infection. We also report that silencing of genes involved in synthesis of taurine and hypotaurine modulates CHIKV infection and redox biology of Aedes mosquitoes during the infection.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into four groups (n=8/group) as follows: (1) control group (oral administration of saline [0.1 mL daily] for 35 days); (2) NAC group (oral administration of NAC [10 mg/kg daily] for 35 days); (3) busulfan group (double intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg; total dose of 40 mg/kg); and (4) busulfan+NAC group (after double intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg; total dose of 40 mg/kg, NAC administration [10 mg/kg daily] for 35 days). The testes were removed, weighed, and subjected to sperm parameter analysis and morphology assessment. Reproductive hormone, serum/testicular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, oxidative stress and antioxidant markers were evaluated. The testicular expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 was examined using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Busulfan treatment significantly decreased testicular weight, sperm count, and serum testosterone levels. Atrophy and degeneration of germinal epithelium were observed in the busulfan group. NAC administration after busulfan treatment partially attenuated the deterioration of testis weight, sperm quality, serum hormones, histomorphometric changes, and oxidative and antioxidative status. NAC treatment resulted in a considerable improvement in Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides compelling evidence that NAC as a potent antioxidant has significant protective effects against busulfan-induced male reproductive impairment possibly through modification of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "Drug-induced ototoxicity resulting from therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics and loop diuretics is one of the main well-known causes of hearing loss in patients. Unfortunately, no specific protection and prevention from hearing loss are recommended for these patients. This study aimed at evaluating the ototoxic effects produced by mixtures of amikacin (AMI, an aminoglycoside antibiotic) and furosemide (FUR, a loop diuretic) in the mouse model as the hearing threshold decreased by 20% and 50% using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Ototoxicity was produced by the combinations of a constant dose of AMI (500 mg/kg; i.p.) on FUR-induced hearing threshold decreases, and a fixed dose of FUR (30 mg/kg; i.p.) on AMI-induced hearing threshold decreases, which were determined in two sets of experiments. Additionally, the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC; 500 mg/kg; i.p.) on the hearing threshold decrease of 20% and 50% were determined by means of an isobolographic transformation of interactions to detect the otoprotective action of NAC in mice. The results indicate that the influence of a constant dose of AMI on FUR-induced hearing threshold decreases was more ototoxic in experimental mice than a fixed dose of FUR on AMI-induced ototoxicity. Moreover, NAC reversed the AMI-induced, but not FUR-induced, hearing threshold decreases in this mouse model of hearing loss. NAC could be considered an otoprotectant in the prevention of hearing loss in patients receiving AMI alone and in combination with FUR.",

Analyses of morphology and structure showed that well-crystalline p (L-Cys) on g-C3N4/GCE was successfully electropolymerized. Studying the electrochemical characteristics of p (L-Cys)/g-C3N4/GCE using CV and DPV techniques revealed a synergistic impact between g-C3N4 and l-cysteine that improved the stability and selectivity of the electrochemical oxidation of MTX while enhancing the electrochemical signal. Results showed that 7.5-780 μM was the linear range, and that 0.11841 μA/μM and 6 nM, respectively, were the sensitivity and limit of detection. The applicability of the suggested sensors was assessed using real pharmaceutical preparations, and the results showed that p (L-Cys)/g-C3N4/GCE had a high degree of precision. Five breast cancer patients who volunteered and provided prepared blood serum samples between the ages of 35 and 50 were used to examine the validity and accuracy of the proposed sensor in the current work for the determination of MTX. The results showed good recovery values (greater than 97.20%), appropriate accuracy (RSD less than 5.11%), and good agreement between the ELISA and DPV analysis results. These findings showed that p (L-Cys)/g-C3N4/GCE can be applied as a trustworthy MTX sensor for MTX level monitoring in blood samples and pharmaceutical samples.",

      "abstract": "Pichia pastoris is widely used for the production of recombinant proteins, but the low secretion efficiency hinders its wide application in biopharmaceuticals. Our previous study had shown that N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) promotes human serum albumin and porcine follicle-stimulating hormone fusion protein (HSA-pFSHβ) secretion by increasing intracellular GSH levels, but the downstream impact mechanism is not clear. In this study, we investigated the roles of autophagy as well as cell phenotype in NAC promoting HSA-pFSHβ secretion. Our results showed that NAC slowed down the cell growth rate, and its effects were unaffected by Congo Red and Calcofluor White. Moreover, NAC affected cell wall composition by increasing chitin content and decreasing β-1,3-glucan content. In addition, the expressions of vesicular pathway and autophagy-related genes were significantly decreased after NAC treatment. Further studies revealed that autophagy, especially the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, mitophagy and pexophagy, was significantly increased with time, and NAC has a promoting effect on autophagy, especially at 48 h and 72 h of NAC treatment. However, the disruption of mitophagy receptor Atg32, but not pexophagy receptor Atg30, inhibited HSA-pFSHβ production, and neither of them inhibited the NAC-promoted effect of HSA-pFSHβ. In conclusion, vesicular transport, autophagy and cell wall are all involved in the NAC-promoted HSA-pFSHβ secretion and that disruption of the autophagy receptor alone does not inhibit the effect of NAC.",

How to effectively treat GDM has always been a concern of people.Research methods: In this study, a diabetes model was established by drug-induced mice. Subsequently, the blood glucose levels and serum insulin changes of the mice after N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) treatment were observed. At the same time, the effect of NAC on reproduction of GDM mice was recorded.Results of the study: Mice fed NAC showed significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to Diabetic/Control. Total serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and serum low-density lipoprotein were significantly reduced, and atherosclerosis index was much lower than in control mice. In addition, Diabetic/Control mice had lower litter sizes and higher birth weights. NAC treatment significantly restored litter size and reduced birth weight in Diabetic/Control mice. It was found in WB assay that the NAC-fed group significantly increased nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 expression levels.Conclusion: NAC can improve blood glucose tolerance in GDM mice; NAC effectively relieves the symptoms of hyperlipidemia caused by GDM; NAC enhances the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 in the liver, thereby restoring redox homeostasis. NAC can reduce gestational diabetes-related disease indicators by oral administration, and has a beneficial effect on the offspring of pregnant mice (reduces its diabetes disease indicators).",

      "abstract": "Plum is an important stone fruit in China, but the fruit is easily perishable and susceptible to infection by pathogens. Traditionally, synthetic fungicides are used to control diseases. However, the side effects of fungicides should not be ignored. Cysteine, generally recognized as safe (GRAS) amino acid, has been reported to play roles in the plant abiotic stress response, but little is known about the role of cysteine to control postharvest diseases in fruits. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effect of L-cysteine treatment on control of postharvest brown rot in artificially inoculated plum fruits and the possible biocontrol mechanisms involved. Postharvest plum fruits were inoculated with 1, 10, 100 and 1000 mg L-1 L-cysteine. 100 mg L-1 L-cysteine treatment effectively controlled brown rot in artificially inoculated plum fruits by inducing resistance. Furthermore, 100 mg L-1 L-cysteine treatment increased the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), enhanced the content of NADPH of the pentose phosphate pathway, as well as improved the contents of H2O2 and some amino acids in the artificially inoculated plum fruits. 100 mg L-1 L-cysteine treatment also elevated the antioxidant content (AsA, GSH) and the antioxidant enzymes activities (APX, GR, MDAR, DHAR) of the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) pathway. The protective effects of L-cysteine treatment on postharvest plum fruits likely be due to activating some defense-related responses of the fruit against infection. L-cysteine treatment is a safe promising method for controlling postharvest brown rot in plum fruits.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Pepper fruit is a horticultural product worldwide consumed that has great nutritional and economic relevance. Besides the phenotypical changes that undergo pepper fruit during ripening, there are many associated modifications at transcriptomic, proteomic, biochemical, and metabolic levels. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are recognized signal molecules that can exert regulatory functions in diverse plant processes. This study aims at analyzing the interrelationship between NO and H2S during fruit ripening. Results: Our data indicate that the H2S-generating cytosolic L-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD) and the mitochondrial D-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCD) activities are downregulated during ripening but this effect was reverted after NO treatment of fruits. Innovation and Conclusion: Using as a model the non-climacteric pepper fruits at different ripening stages and under an NO-enriched atmosphere, the activity of the H2S-generating LCD and DCD was analyzed. LCD and DCD activities were downregulated during ripening, but this effect was reverted after NO treatment of fruits. The analysis of LCD activity by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) allowed identifying three isozymes designated CaLCD I to CaLCD III, which were differentially modulated by NO and strictly dependent on pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). In vitro analyses of green fruit samples in the presence of different compounds including NO donors, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and reducing agents such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and L-cysteine (L-Cys) triggered an almost 100% inhibition of CaLCD II and CaLCD III. This redox adaptation process of both enzymes could be cataloged as a hormesis phenomenon. The protein tyrosine (Tyr) nitration (an NO-promoted post-translational modification) of the recombinant LCD was corroborated by immunoblot and by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Among the 11 Tyr residues present in this enzyme, MS of the recombinant LCD enabled us to identify that Tyr82 and Tyr254 were nitrated by ONOO-, this occurring near the active center on the enzyme, where His237 and Lys260 together with the cofactor PLP are involved. These data support the relationship between NO and H2S during pepper fruit ripening, since LCD and DCD are regulated by NO during this physiological event, and this could also be extrapolated to other plant species.",

      "abstract": "Conditioning therapy is an essential procedure prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), imposing a great impact on the outcomes of recipients. We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial to assess the outcome of HSCT recipients with myeloid malignancies after receiving the conditioning therapy consisting of modified BUCY (mBUCY), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), and decitabine. Enrolled patients were randomly allocated to either Arm A (decitabine, day -12 to -10; NAC, day -9 to +30; mBUCY, day -9 to -2), or Arm B (mBUCY regimen followed by stem cells infusion). Seventy-six patients in Arm A and 78 patients in Arm B were finally evaluated. The results showed platelet recovery accelerate in Arm A, with more patients achieving a platelet count of ≥50 × 109 /L than Arm B at day +30 and +60 (p = .004 and .043, respectively). The cumulative incidence of relapse is 11.8% (95% CI 0.06-0.22) in Arm A, and 24.4% (95% CI 0.16-0.35) in Arm B (p = .048). The estimated 3-year overall survival rate was 86.4% (±4.4%) and 79.9% (±4.7%) in 2 arms, respectively (p = .155). EFS at 3 years was 79.2% (±4.9%) in Arm A and 60.0% (±5.9%) in Arm B (p = .007). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was found to be reversely correlated with platelet recovery, and fewer patients in Arm A displayed excessive ROS within hematopoietic progenitor cells compared to Arm B. In conclusion, the addition of decitabine and NAC to mBUCY is a feasible and promising conditioning therapy for myeloid malignancies patients.",

Biodegradation of mycotoxin is an eco-friendly and efficient control strategy. Still, research works are warranted to develop low-cost, efficient, and sustainable approaches to enhance the mycotoxin degradation efficiency of microorganisms. In this study, the activities of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) against OTA toxicity were evidenced, and its positive effects on the OTA degradation efficiency of antagonistic yeast, Cryptococcus podzolicus Y3 were verified. Co-culturing C. podzolicus Y3 with 10 mM NAC improved 100% and 92.6% OTA degradation rate into ochratoxin α (OTα) at 1 d and 2 d. The excellent promotion role of NAC on OTA degradation was observed even at low temperatures and alkaline conditions. C. podzolicus Y3 treated with OTA or OTA+NAC promoted reduced glutathione (GSH) accumulation. GSS and GSR genes were highly expressed after OTA and OTA+NAC treatment, contributing to GSH accumulation. In the early stages of NAC treatment, yeast viability and cell membrane were reduced, but the antioxidant property of NAC prevented lipid peroxidation. Our finding provides a sustainable and efficient new strategy to improve mycotoxin degradation by antagonistic yeasts, which could be applied to mycotoxin clearance.",

The Fe3O4-L-Cys-Dox NPs were extensively characterized for their compositional and morpho-structural features using EDS, SAED, XRD, FTIR and TEM. XPS, Mӧssbauer spectroscopy and SQUID measurements were also performed to determine the electronic and magnetic properties of the Fe3O4-L-Cys-Dox nanoparticles. Moreover, by means of a FO-SPR sensor, we evidenced and confirmed the binding of Dox to L-Cys. Biological tests on mouse (B16F10) and human (A375) metastatic melanoma cells evidenced the internalization of magnetic nanoparticles delivering Dox. Half maximum inhibitory concentration IC50 values of Fe3O4-L-Cys-Dox were determined for both cell lines: 4.26 µg/mL for A375 and 2.74 µg/mL for B16F10, as compared to 60.74 and 98.75 µg/mL, respectively, for unloaded controls. Incubation of cells with Fe3O4-L-Cys-Dox modulated MAPK signaling pathway activity 3 h post-treatment and produced cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis by 48 h. We show that within the first 2 h of incubation in physiological (pH = 7.4) media, ~10-15 µM Dox/h was released from a 200 µg/mL Fe3O4-L-Cys-Dox solution, as compared to double upon incubation in citrate solution (pH = 3), which resembles acidic environment conditions. Our results highlight the potential of Fe3O4-L-Cys-Dox NPs as efficient drug delivery vehicles in melanoma therapy."

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are the major source of Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), a reactive oxygen species, in the cells. The reactive oxygen species generated by the mitochondria oxidize major proteins including Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC). We were interested to know how the effect of H2O2 is countered by antioxidants present around the mitochondria. N-Acetyl-l-Cysteine (NAC) is a naturally existing antioxidant in the cells. Keeping this in view, the modulatory effect of antioxidant NAC on H2O2 oxidized VDAC has been investigated through in vitro electrophysiological studies. First, the effect of H2O2 and NAC was studied on independently incorporated single-channel VDAC. It was observed that NAC suppresses VDAC conductance with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ∼1.04 μM. In contrast, H2O2 enhances VDAC conductance. Later, oxidative stress was induced by H2O2 on VDAC increased conductance with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of ∼302 nM. An application of 1 μM NAC on H2O2 treated (300 nM) VDAC reversed the effect of oxidation. In the next step, NAC and H2O2 were added in reverse order. When oxidative stress was induced using H2O2, reduction in conductance by NAC was 4.5 ± 0.404 nS. The change in conductance is nearly 6.3%. However, if antioxidant NAC was incubated first followed by H2O2 treatment, the conductance of VDAC was 3.09 ± 0.27 nS. The change in conductance is near 33%. Both H2O2 and NAC also affected various conducting states of VDAC. In-silico studies indicated the binding of NAC at Lysine and Glutamic acid of VDAC. Hence, NAC was found to be effective in protection of VDAC against H2O2-induced oxidative stress due to its strong binding.",

      "abstract": "Four peptide amphiphiles (PA1-4) with different degrees of polymerization (DP = 40, 15, 10, and 6) were synthesized by Fuchs-Farthing and ring-opening polymerization followed by post-polymerization modification, as fully characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR, gel permeation chromatography, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. It was found that PAs could self-assemble to form regular spherical micelles in low-concentration (about 1 mg/mL) aqueous solution, which had different contents of secondary structures and mainly adopted random coil conformations. The water solubility of PAs increases with the increase of DP, the polypeptide chain stretches randomly in water, the β-sheets decrease, and the random coil conformations dominate. When the pH of PA solution decreases or increases, intramolecular hydrogen bonds break, and molecular chains stretch, leading to a decrease of α-helix, turn conformations, and an increase of β-sheets. Meanwhile, the particle size of micelles increases. At around 0.4 mg/mL, the hemolysis ability of PA2 is negligible at pH 7.4 and 6.5 and about 33% at pH 5.5. Cisplatin (CDDP) was linked to micelles by coordination bonds to explore their potential as drug carriers, exhibiting controlled pH and reduction in dual drug release effects. MTT assay showed that the HeLa cell viability was 78% when cultured in the 13.5 μg/mL PA2 blank micelles for 2 days, while the cell viability was 60% in the CDDP-loaded micelles. Furthermore, a high concentration of PA2 (about 100 mg/mL) could self-assemble into a fibrous hydrogel at pH 5.5, which self-healed 2 h after incision and self-degraded 71% within 14 days. The CDDP-loaded fiber hydrogel exhibited a sustained release effect similar to the CDDP-loaded micelles. The cytotoxicity of CDDP-loaded fibers at 48 h was detected to be the same as that of the same amount of CDDP, and the cell viability was 7%. Therefore, we provide a new strategy for the synthesis of amphiphilic peptides with potential applications in nano-drug carriers and cancer therapy.",

At the present, the cytotoxic mechanism of ZIFs in cardiovascular disorders was still unclear. Our experiment explored the toxicity of ZIF-8, a typical kind of ZIFs, on human EA.hy926 vascular endothelial cells. The cell viability, ROS formation, apoptosis level, inflammatory response level, wound healing ability and atherosclerosis-related indicators of EA.hy926 endothelial cells were analyzed after ZIF-8 treatment. Meanwhile, we evaluated the ability of antioxidant N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to attenuate the toxicity of ZIF-8 on EA.hy926 endothelial cells. As results, NAC attenuated ROS formation, cell apoptosis, LDH formation and endothelial dysfunction caused by ZIF-8. As the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was involved in endothelial cell dysfunction, we also studied the expression level of β-catenin and LEF1 in ZIF-8 and/or NAC treated EA.hy926 cells. As expected, ZIF-8 increased the protein expressions of β-catenin and LEF1in the IC50 group, which was significantly inhibited by co-treatment with NAC. Taken together, this study could help improve our understanding about the mechanism of ZIF-8-induced endothelial cells injury and NAC had therapeutic potential in preventing ZIF-8-associated endothelial dysfunction by wnt/β-catenin pathway.",

Moreover, many biopharmaceutical-like proteins are accompanied by degradation during secretory expression in P. pastoris. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used human serum albumin and porcine follicle-stimulating hormone β (HSA-pFSHβ) fusion protein as a model protein to investigate whether YPS1 and YPT7 gene disruption and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) supplementation have synergistic effects to inhibit the degradation of recombinant proteins. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results showed that YPS1 gene disruption reduced the degradation of intact HSA-pFSHβ and increased the yield of intact protein in the culture medium and cells without affecting the integrity of the cell wall. Moreover, the beneficial effects of YPS1 gene disruption were associated with the upregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway and maintenance of redox homeostasis. YPS1 gene disruption and NAC supplementation had synergistic effects on HSA-pFSHβ production. In addition, disruption of vacuolar morphology by YPT7 gene disruption or NH4Cl treatment affected the production of recombinant HSA-pFSHβ protein. Furthermore, YPT7 gene disruption inhibited the processing of signal peptide in high-level produced HSA-pFSHβ strain. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that YPS1 disruption could reduce the degradation of intact HSA-pFSHβ proteins, and synergistically increase the yield of intact HSA-pFSHβ with NAC supplementation. This study provided a valuable reference for reducing recombinant protein degradation and therefore improving the yield of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tendon injury is associated with oxidative stress, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammation. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a potent antioxidant. However, how NAC affects the biological functions of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) and tendon repair has not been clarified.  METHOD: The impacts of NAC on the viability, ROS production, and differentiation of TSPCs were determined with the cell counting kit-8, fluorescence staining, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The effect of NAC on gene transcription in TSPCs was analyzed by transcriptomes and bioinformatics and validated by Western blotting. The potential therapeutic effect of NAC on tendon repair was tested in a rat model of Achilles tendon injury. RESULTS: Compared with the untreated control, treatment with 500 µM NAC greatly promoted the proliferation of TSPCs and significantly mitigated hydrogen peroxide-induced ROS production and cytotoxicity in vitro. NAC treatment significantly increased the relative protein expression of collagen type 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1), tenascin C (TNC), scleraxis (SCX), and tenomodulin (TNMD) in TPSCs. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that NAC modulated transcriptomes, particularly in the integrin-related phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, and Western blotting revealed that NAC enhanced integrin α5β1 expression and PI3K/AKT activation in TSPCs. Finally, NAC treatment mitigated the tendon injury, but enhanced the protein expression of SCX, TNC, TNMD, and COLIA1 in the injured tissue regions of the rats. CONCLUSION: NAC treatment promoted the survival and differentiation of TSPCs to facilitate tendon repair after tendon injury in rats. Thus, NAC may be valuable for the treatment of tendon injury.",

Through the permeation and retention studies of isolated cornea, it was demonstrated that Dex-CS-Cys-cNLC has better corneal permeation and retention ability and can better overcome the barrier effect of the ocular surface. In addition, the fluorescent probe (RhB) was used to replace the drug, and fluorescence imaging was used to investigate the ocular surface retention ability of the formulation, and the results showed that CS-Cys-cNLC has stronger retention ability and can effectively prolong the time of drug action in the ocular surface. Dex-CS-Cys-cNLC was not irritating to rabbit eye tissues and was a safe delivery system. The results of rabbit dry eye pharmacodynamic experiments also showed that Dex-CS-Cys-cNLC could effectively alleviate dry eye symptoms in rabbits, effectively repair corneal damage, and improve the stability of tear film. All these experimental results suggest that Dex-CS-Cys-cNLC is a promising drug delivery carrier for the treatment of anterior segment of the eye disease.",

We have previously shown that intranasal administration combined with PEG-PCL-Tat (a nanocarrier) efficiently delivers drugs to the brain and exhibits excellent therapeutic efficacy against brain diseases. We aimed to clarify whether intranasal administration combined with PEG-PCL-Tat represents a useful drug delivery system (DDS) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pharmacotherapy. We used N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) as a model drug with low transferability to the spinal cord and determined the physicochemical properties of NAC/PEG-PCL-Tat. After intranasal administration of NAC/PEG-PCL-Tat, we measured the survival duration of superoxide dismutase-1 G93A mutant transgenic mice (G93A mice), widely used in ALS studies, and quantitatively analyzed the tissue distribution of NAC/PEG-PCL-Tat in ddY mice. The mean particle size and zeta potential of NAC/PEG-PCL-Tat were 294 nm and + 9.29 mV, respectively. Treatment with repeated intranasal administration of NAC/PEG-PCL-Tat considerably prolonged the median survival of G93A mice by 11.5 days compared with that of untreated G93A mice. Moreover, the highest distribution after a single administration of NAC/PEG-PCL-Tat was measured in the spinal cord. These results suggest that intranasal administration combined with PEG-PCL-Tat might represent a useful DDS for ALS therapeutics."

In this study, fresh-cut button mushrooms were treated with 0.25 g/L l-cysteine (l-Cys) and evaluated in terms of quality, physiology, and transcriptome sequencing. The results indicated that l-Cys application significantly delayed the browning degree of fresh-cut button mushrooms and reduced weight loss. l-Cys treatment reduced the malondialdehyde content, lipoxygenase activity, and reducing sugar levels while enhancing the soluble protein and total phenolic content. Furthermore, l-Cys treatment reduced the O2- generation rate and H2O2 accumulation while enhancing the catalase activity. Moreover, l-Cys improved the superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activities while reducing those of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase. Additionally, l-Cys treatment increased endogenous H2S production and AbCBS enzyme activity while decreasing AbCSE enzyme activity. Notably, additional treatment with 1 mM propargylglycine significantly reduced the effect of l-Cys. Moreover, transcriptome sequencing analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes in the l-Cys group were primarily related to the reactive oxygen species metabolism, oxidoreductase process, membrane integrality, and sulfur metabolism. These findings suggested that l-Cys treatment delayed the aging and extended the shelf life of fresh-cut button mushrooms by regulating the active oxygen species metabolism and water loss and stimulating endogenous H2S production.",

N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) has a variety of effects, interfering with the production and scavenging of free radicals and regulating the metabolic activity of tissue cells. However, the efficacy of NAC on DN treatment is unclear. Thus, this study investigated the protective mechanism of NAC combined with insulin on renal injury in dogs with DN. The forty dogs were selected and divided into control group, DM group, INS group, INS + NAC group and NAC group to establish the model for a trial period of 4 months. The results revealed that INS + NAC was effective in reducing and stabilizing blood glucose levels. Biochemical results showed that INS + NAC treatment significantly regulated the stability of UREA, CREA and fructosamine indicators. Meanwhile, histopathology staining showed significant glomerular wrinkling and fibrosis in the DM group, which could be reversed after INS + NAC treatment. In addition, INS + NAC could restore mitochondria homeostasis by upregulating the levels of mitochondrial fission (MFN1, MFN2 and OPA1) and inhibiting of mitochondrial fusion (DRP1, FIS1 and MFF) related indicators. Further studies revealed that INS + NAC regulated the expression levels of renal BNIP3, NIX and FUNDC1 in the DM group, thereby alleviating mitophagy. Collectively, these results suggested that NAC combined with insulin protects DN by regulating the mitochondrial dynamics and FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy.",

L-Cys showed various antioxidant characteristics. Though, studies on the effect of free L-Cys administration to evaluate the CNS functioning is very limited. Therefore, we assessed the effects of L-Cys on corticosterone (CORT) induced oxidative stress, behavioral deficits and memory impairment in male rats. L-Cys (150 mg/kg/ml) administered to vehicle and CORT (20 mg/kg/ml) treated rats orally for 28 days. Behavioral activities were conducted after treatment period. Subsequently, rats were sacrificed, blood and brain were removed. Hippocampus was isolated from brain and then hippocampus and plasma were collected for oxidative, biochemical and neurochemical analysis. Results showed that repeated treatment of L-Cys produced antidepressant, anxiolytic and memory-improving effects which may be ascribed to the enhanced antioxidant profile, normalized cholinergic, serotonergic neurotransmission in brain (hippocampus) following CORT administration. Increased plasma CORT by CORT administration was also normalized by L-Cys. The current study concluded that administration of free L-Cys improved the behavioral, biochemical, neurochemical and redox status of CNS.

      "abstract": "Biofilm formation by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with colonization of the upper respiratory tract, including the carrier state, and with chronic respiratory infections in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The use of antibiotics alone to treat recalcitrant infections caused by biofilms is insufficient in many cases, requiring novel strategies based on a combination of antibiotics with other agents, including antibodies, enzybiotics, and antioxidants. In this work, we demonstrate that the third-generation oral cephalosporin cefditoren (CDN) and the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) are synergistic against pneumococcal biofilms. Additionally, the combination of CDN and NAC resulted in the inhibition of bacterial growth (planktonic and biofilm cells) and destruction of the biofilm biomass. This marked antimicrobial effect was also observed in terms of viability in both inhibition (prevention) and disaggregation (treatment) assays. Moreover, the use of CDN and NAC reduced bacterial adhesion to human lung epithelial cells, confirming that this strategy of combining these two compounds is effective against resistant pneumococcal strains colonizing the lung epithelium. Finally, administration of CDN and NAC in mice suffering acute pneumococcal pneumonia caused by a multidrug-resistant strain was effective in clearing the bacteria from the respiratory tract in comparison to treatment with either compound alone. Overall, these results demonstrate that the combination of oral cephalosporins and antioxidants, such as CDN and NAC, respectively, is a promising strategy against respiratory biofilms caused by S. pneumoniae. IMPORTANCE Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the deadliest bacterial pathogens, accounting for up to 2 million deaths annually prior to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Vaccines have decreased the burden of diseases produced by S. pneumoniae, but the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains and nonvaccine serotypes is worrisome. Pneumococcal biofilms are associated with chronic respiratory infections, and treatment is challenging, making the search for new antibiofilm therapies a priority as biofilms become resistant to traditional antibiotics. In this work, we used the combination of an antibiotic (CDN) and an antioxidant (NAC) to treat the pneumococcal biofilms of relevant clinical isolates. We demonstrated a synergy between CDN and NAC that inhibited and treated pneumococcal biofilms, impaired pneumococcal adherence to the lung epithelium, and treated pneumonia in a mouse pneumonia model. We propose the widely used cephalosporin CDN and the repurposed drug NAC as a new antibiofilm therapy against S. pneumoniae biofilms, including those formed by antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) alone is a precancerous condition for gastric cancer. Achlorhydria plays an important role in the formation of a class I carcinogen, acetaldehyde. L-cysteine has been claimed to bind acetaldehyde covalently. Symptoms are present in 55% of CAG patients, of whom 70% have upper gastrointestinal complaints. The aim of this study was to investigate the properties of L-cysteine in the modification of symptom patterns in CAG patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients with histological diagnosis of CAG (OLGA ≥1 with gastric corpus involvement) were evaluated with serological determination of gastric function, clinical assessment of symptoms using the visual analog score (VAS) and the global symptomatic score (GSS), and considered for therapy with L-cysteine, 300 mg daily. Data regarding symptoms were collected at enrollment and after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with an ultimate follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS: A total of 330 patients with CAG were divided in group 1 (77 patients treated with L-cysteine) and group 2 (50 patients who received no specific treatment - control group). A statistically significant improvement in the VAS score (7.8 at baseline vs. 4.5 after 24 months; p < 0.01) was observed in patients treated with L-cysteine, while no significant changes in symptom pattern/intensity were recorded in the 2-year follow-up of untreated patients with CAG. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with L-cysteine provides symptom improvement in CAG patients and might be proposed as maintenance therapy in such patients.",

      "abstract": "Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxicant that could induce oxidative stress and autophagy. However, the underlying mechanisms through which MeHg affects the central nervous system have not been fully elucidated, and little has been known of the interaction between oxidative stress and autophagy. Therefore, rats were administrated with different MeHg concentrations to evaluate the neurotoxic effects and autophagy in cerebral cortex. Moreover, we have investigated the neuroprotective role of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) against MeHg-induced neurotoxicity in order to estimate the regulation effects of oxidative stress on autophagy. A total of 64 rats, 40 of which were randomly divided into control and MeHg-treated (4, 8 and 12 μ mol/kg) groups. The remaining 24 rats were divided into control, NAC control (1 mmol/kg), 12 μ mol/kg MeHg, and NAC pretreatment. Administration of 12 μ mol/kg MeHg significantly increased behavioral and pathological abnormalities, and autophagy levels. In addition, the oxidative stress levels increased, together with abnormal expression of autophagy-related molecules. Pretreatment with NAC significantly prevented MeHg-induced oxidative stress and PI3K/AKT/mTOR or AMPK/TSC2/mTOR-mediated autophagy. In conclusion, the present study suggested that oxidative stress can regulate autophagy through PI3K/AKT/mTOR or AMPK/TSC2/mTOR pathways. This study provides a theoretical basis for the study and treatment of MeHg-induced neurotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, formed on implants, have a massive impact on the increasing number of antimicrobial resistance cases. The current treatment for biofilm-associated infections is based on the administration of antibiotics, failing to target the biofilm matrix. This work is focused on the development of multiple lipid nanoparticles (MLNs) encapsulating the antibiotic moxifloxacin (MOX). The nanoparticles were functionalized with d-amino acids to target the biofilm matrix. The produced formulations exhibited a mean hydrodynamic diameter below 300 nm, a low polydispersity index, and high encapsulation efficiency. The nanoparticles exhibited low cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts and low hemolytic activity. To target bacterial cells and the biofilm matrix, MOX-loaded MLNs were combined with a nanosystem encapsulating a matrix-disruptive agent: N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). The nanosystems alone showed a significant reduction of both S. aureus biofilm viability and biomass, using the microtiter plate biofilm model. Further, biofilms grown inside polyurethane catheters were used to assess the effect of combining MOX-loaded and NAC-loaded nanosystems on biofilm viability. An increased antibiofilm efficacy was observed when combining the functionalized MOX-loaded MLNs and NAC-loaded nanosystems. Thus, nanosystems as carriers of bactericidal and matrix-disruptive agents are a promising combinatory strategy towards the eradication of S. aureus biofilms."

      "abstract": "The particular scale structure and mechanical properties of wool fiber make its associated fabrics prone to felting, seriously affecting the service life of wool products. Although the existing Chlorine-Hercosett treatment has a remarkable effect, it can lead to environmental pollution. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop an environmentally friendly and effective shrink-proof finishing technology. For this study, L-cysteine was mixed with protease to form a treatment solution system for shrink-proof finishing of wool fibers. The reduction performance of L-cysteine and its effect on wool were compared with those of other reagents, demonstrating that L-cysteine has an obvious reduction and destruction effect on the wool scale layer. Based on this, L-cysteine and protease 16L were mixed in a certain proportion to prepare an L-cysteine/protease treatment solution system (L/PTSS). The shrink-proof finishing of a wool top was carried out by the continuous multiple-padding method, and the processing parameters were optimized using the response surface method. The results indicated that when the concentrations of L-cysteine and protease 16L were 9 g/L and 1 g/L, respectively, the wool was padded five times at 50 °C, and each immersion time was 30 s, the felt ball density of the treated wool reduced from 135.86 kg/m3 to 48.65 kg/m3. The structure and properties of the treated wool were also characterized using SEM, TG, and tensile strength tests, which indicated that the fiber scale structure was stripped evenly. Meanwhile, the treated fibers still retained adequate thermal and mechanical properties, indicating suitable application value. XPS, FT-IR, Raman, UV absorbance, and other test results revealed the reaction mechanism of L/PTSS with the wool fibers. After L-cysteine rapidly reduced the disulfide bonds in wool, protease can hydrolyze peptide chains more effectively, causing the scale layer to gradually peel off. Compared with the chlorination method and other protease shrink-proof technologies, L/PTSS can achieve the finishing effect on wool rapidly and effectively, without causing excessive pollution to the environment. The conclusions of this study provide a foundation for the development and industrial application of biological enzyme shrink-proof finishing technology.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a severe complication of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by aberrant myocardial structure and function and is the primary cause of heart failure and death in diabetic patients. Endothelial dysfunction plays an essential role in diabetes and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but its role in DCM is unclear. Previously, we showed that S-nitroso-L-cysteine(CSNO), an endogenous S-nitrosothiol derived from eNOS, inhibited the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a critical negative modulator of insulin signaling. In this study, we reported that CSNO treatment induced cellular insulin-dependent and insulin-independent glucose uptake. In addition, CSNO activated insulin signaling pathway and promoted GLUT4 membrane translocation. CSNO protected cardiomyocytes against high glucose-induced injury by ameliorating excessive autophagy activation, mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress. Furthermore, nebulized CSNO improved cardiac function and myocardial fibrosis in diabetic mice. These results suggested a potential site for endothelial modulation of insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism in the development of DCM. Data from these studies will not only help us understand the mechanisms of DCM, but also provide new therapeutic options for treatment.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the anticancer effect of dipropyl thiosulfinate produced in situ by the pharmacological pair: (1) conjugated with daidzein C115H methionine γ-lyase (EC 4.4.1.11, C115H MGL-Dz) and (2) the substrate, S-propyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (propiin) against various solid tumor types in vitro and in vivo. The MTT test was used to calculate IC50 values for HT29, COLO205 and HCT116 (colon cancer); Panc1 and MIA-PaCa2 (pancreatic cancer); and 22Rv1, DU-145 and PC3 (prostate cancer). The most promising effect for colon cancer cells in vitro was observed in HT29 (IC50 = 6.9 µM). The IC50 values for MIA-PaCa2 and Panc1 were 3.4 and 3.8 µM, respectively. Among prostate cancer cells, 22Rv1 was the most sensitive (IC50 = 5.4 µM). In vivo antitumor activity of the pharmacological pair was studied in HT29, SW620, Panc1, MIA-PaCa2 and 22Rv1 subcutaneous xenografts in BALB/c nude mice. The application of C115H MGL-Dz /propiin demonstrated a significant reduction in the tumor volume of Panc1 (TGI 67%; p = 0.004), MIA-PaCa2 (TGI 50%; p = 0.011), HT29 (TGI 51%; p = 0.04) and 22Rv1 (TGI 70%; p = 0.043) xenografts. The results suggest that the combination of C115H MGL-Dz/propiin is able to suppress tumor growth in vitro and in vivo and the use of this pharmacological pair can be considered as a new strategy for the treatment of solid tumors.",

      "abstract": "Treatment of Ischemic Stroke is inordinately challenging due to its complex aetiology and constraints in shuttling therapeutics across blood-brain barrier. Ropinirole hydrochloride (Rp), a propitious neuroprotectant with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties (3A) is repurposed for remedying ischemic stroke and reperfusion (I/R) injury. The drug's low bioavailability in brain however, limits its therapeutic efficacy. The current research work has reported sub-100 nm gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteine coated Human Serum Albumin nanoparticles encapsulating Rp (C-Rp-NPs) for active targeting in ischemic brain to encourage in situ activity and reduce unwanted toxicities. Confocal microscopy and brain distribution studies confirmed the enhanced targeting potentiality of optimized C-Rp-NPs. The pharmacokinetics elucidated that C-Rp-NPs could extend Rp retention in systemic circulation and escalate bioavailability compared with free Rp solution (Rp-S). Additionally, therapeutic assessment in transient middle cerebral occlusion (tMCAO) model suggested that C-Rp-NPs attenuated the progression of I/R injury with boosted therapeutic index at 1000 times less concentration compared to Rp-S via reinstating neurological and behavioral deficits, while reducing ischemic neuronal damage. Moreover, C-Rp-NPs blocked mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP), disrupted apoptotic mechanisms, curbed oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and elevated dopamine levels post tMCAO. Thus, our work throws light on fabrication of rationally designed C-Rp-NPs with enormous clinical potential.",

      "abstract": "This study was meant to describe a Poloxamer hydrogel combining Chitosan-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (CNAC) nanoparticles to increase loading and sustained intravitreal administration of Avastin macromolecule. To increase the drug's efficacy and reduce the interfacial fluid pressure in a formulation, dexamethasone was used. To do so, CNAC was synthesized. Then, Avastin- loaded CNAC nanoparticles were prepared and optimized. The resulting hydrogel's sol-gel transition time and viscosity were determined using poloxamer and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). In vitro and in vivo investigations of Avastin-loaded CNAC nanoparticles and hydrogel comprising dexamethasone/Avastin-loaded CNAC nanoparticles were determined. In vitro, the drug release profile of optimized hydrogel containing Avastin-loaded CNAC nanoparticles was sustained and controlled over 256 h. The obtained results point to poloxamer/HPMC (18 %/0.5 %) as the best formulations for this hydrogel to develop a sol-gel transition. About 97 % of dexamethasone was released from the hydrogel within 18 h. In vivo results indicated that the optimized formulation compared with free Avastin could improve Diabetic retinopathy (DR). Consequently, we infer that this new drug delivery method may enhance Avastin intravitreal administration, lowering the frequency, danger, and expense of heavy intravitreal injections and resulting in improved treatment of posterior eye segment neovascularization and concomitant vitreoretinal disorders.",

      "abstract": "Obesity plays a major role in type II diabetes (T2DM) progression because it applies metabolic and oxidative stress resulting in dysfunctional beta-cells and activation of intra-islet pancreatic stellate cells (PaSCs) which cause islet fibrosis. Administration of antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in vivo improves metabolic outcomes in diet-induced obese diabetic mice, and in vitro inhibits PaSCs activation. However, the effects of NAC on diabetic islets in vivo are unknown. This study examined if dosage and length of NAC treatment in HFD-induced diabetic mice effect metabolic outcomes associated with maintaining healthy beta-cells and quiescent PaSCs, in vivo. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed normal chow (ND) or high-fat (HFD) diet up to 30 weeks. NAC was administered in drinking water to HFD mice in preventative treatment (HFDpNAC) for 23 weeks or intervention treatment for 10 (HFDiNAC) or 18 (HFDiNAC+) weeks, respectively. HFDpNAC and HFDiNAC+, but not HFDiNAC, mice showed significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Hyperinsulinemia led by beta-cell overcompensation in HFD mice was significantly rescued in NAC treated mice. A reduction of beta-cell nuclear Pdx-1 localization in HFD mice was significantly improved in NAC treated islets along with significantly reduced beta-cell oxidative stress. HFD-induced intra-islet PaSCs activation, labeled by αSMA, was significantly diminished in NAC treated mice along with lesser intra-islet collagen deposition. This study determined that efficiency of NAC treatment is beneficial at maintaining healthy beta-cells and quiescent intra-islet PaSCs in HFD-induced obese T2DM mouse model. These findings highlight an adjuvant therapeutic potential in NAC for controlling T2DM progression in humans.",
