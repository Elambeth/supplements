      "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of tooth-supporting structures, influenced by immune system dysregulation, oxidative stress, and imbalances in bone metabolism. Given its multifactorial pathogenesis, bioactive compounds such as vitamin D, melatonin, and omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as potential adjuncts to periodontal therapy due to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties. This narrative review explores the role of these three supplements in periodontal health, their potential in synergistic effects, and existing research gaps, providing a foundation for future studies on their clinical applications. Vitamin D is essential for calcium homeostasis, bone remodeling, and immune function. It modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, enhancing antimicrobial peptide production and reducing inflammatory cytokine expression. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids while promoting the synthesis of pro-resolving lipid mediators, contributing to bone preservation and immune balance. Melatonin, known for its antioxidant and osteogenic properties, supports bone remodeling by stimulating osteoblast proliferation and inhibiting osteoclast activity, while also regulating circadian rhythms, which may influence oral health. Although these bioactive compounds show promising effects in preclinical and clinical studies, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal dosages, long-term efficacy, combined use, and standardized treatment protocols. Further clinical trials are necessary to elucidate their therapeutic value in periodontal disease management, especially those focused on their potential synergistic mechanisms. Understanding their synergistic mechanisms may open new avenues for adjunctive strategies in periodontal therapy."

      "abstract": "Soccer (football) is the most popular sport globally, with 265 million players across all ages and sexes. Repetitive subconcussive head impacts due to heading of the soccer ball can pose threats to healthy brain development and aging. Omega-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may have neuroprotective effects, but it remains unclear what aspects of neural health benefit from DHA+EPA when faced with subconcussive head impacts. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, 208 soccer players will complete baseline measures including demographics, blood sampling, dietary recalls, and psychological assessment. Participants will be randomly assigned to ingest DHA+EPA [3.4g/d: DHA 2.4g+EPA 1.0g] or placebo daily for 8 weeks followed by a subconcussion intervention phase. During the subconcussion intervention, participants will perform a session of 20 controlled soccer headings, with a second session 24 hours later. Blood samples, neuroimaging data, autonomic reactivity, and clinical measures (symptoms, oculomotor, cognition) will be collected pre-heading and 24-hour post-1st session, 24-hour post-2nd session, and 7-day post-2nd session. The primary hypothesis is that DHA+EPA pretreatment will promote neuronal and astrocyte resiliency to subconcussive head impacts, as assessed by blood biomarkers of brain injury, axonal microstructure measured by diffusion tensor imaging, and whole-brain resting-state connectivity. It is proposed that pretreatment will preserve autonomic function, as assessed by the cold pressor test (CPT), as well as oculomotor and cognitive function, even after head impacts. Data from this trial will help clarify the combined effect of DHA+EPA on brain molecular, cellular, and physiological health in response to subconcussive head impacts. If the hypotheses are confirmed, the findings will support a highly practical intervention for mitigating the neurodegenerative cascade triggered by head impacts.

This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of OM in patients diagnosed with cancer undergoing anticancer therapy. A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang databases for relevant studies, published up to September 24, 2024, was performed. Risk ratio (RR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated using Review Manager version 5.3. Five studies, including 337 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Results of analysis revealed that, although omega-3 fatty acids did not significantly reduce the overall incidence of OM (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25-1.01), it significantly reduced the incidence of severe OM (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17-0.56), with no heterogeneity was observed (p = 0.96; I2= 0%). Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids were found to significantly alleviate OM-associated pain (SMD -1.61, 95% CI -2.79 to -0.43), with no heterogeneity was detected (p = 0.32; I2 = 0%). Omega-3 fatty acids effectively reduced the incidence of severe OM and alleviated OM-related pain in patients undergoing anticancer therapy."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Early-life inflammatory events like infections and injuries may predispose the brain to Alzheimer's disease (AD) by disrupting neurodevelopment and raising vulnerability. The association between early neuroinflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration leading to dementia remains unclear. We hypothesize that omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (FA), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), positively regulate neuro-immune cells, preserving their cell membrane structure and metabolic homeostasis. Our study examined whether strategic delivery of n-3 FA via injectable n-3 triglycerides (TG) can influence microglial lipid metabolism to prevent or delay AD progression. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized n-3 treatment effects on modulating lipid and metabolic homeostasis in microglia during the critical window of brain development. Our preliminary studies on determining the effects of early n-3 treatment on brain cell homeostasis indicate that perinatal bolus n-3 TG injections suppressed activation of gliosis-associated markers in young mice predisposed to AD (5xFAD) and yielded sustained regulatory effects on the expression of inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-6 (Il6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnfα), in adult brains. A significant increase in high-frequency ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) was observed in P6 5xFAD mice that received perinatal n-3 compared to vehicle control, implicating enhanced active communication patterns. Improvement in behavior deficits was observed in n-3-treated adult AD mice. Perinatal n-3 TG treatment modified brain lipid composition in young offspring, increasing key membrane lipid species, such as phospholipids (PL) and lysophospholipids (lysoPL). Pro-inflammatory sphingolipids associated with neurodegeneration, including lactosylceramide, were significantly lower in mice treated with n-3 than those in saline-treated AD mice. CONCLUSION: Our study establishes a proof of principle for targeting brain immune cell metabolism with injectable n-3 TG to mitigate neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis, paving the way for future research into early treatments for related central nervous system (CNS) disorders."

      "abstract": "AIM: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major contributor to global mortality and disability, imposing a significant health and economic burden on patients and society. Despite existing treatment options including medications and surgeries, their effectiveness remains limited, with issues such as suboptimal treatment outcomes and high recurrence rates. This study aims to investigate the relationship between low dietary intake of ω-3 fatty acids and the burden of IHD, hoping to provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of IHD. METHOD: Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 dataset, we examined the impact of low ω-3 dietary intake on the burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) between 1990 and 2021globally, regionally, temporally. The Joinpoint regression model was applied to analyze the trend of IHD burden attributed to low ω-3 dietary intake over time. RESULTS: In 2021, the global IHD-related Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and deaths caused by a low ω-3 diet was 15,511,020(95% UI: 3,098,820 to 25,946,110) and 627,340 (95% UI: 119,540 to 1,082,740), accounting for 8.23% (95% UI: 1.64-13.52%) of all IHD-related DALYs and 6.97% (95% UI: 1.33-11.76%) of all IHD deaths, respectively. From 1990 to 2021, there was a significant upward trend in DALYs and deaths, but age-standardized DALYs and death rates showed a declining trend. Regional analysis indicated that the burden of IHD was highest in South Asia and lowest in High-Income Asia Pacific regions. At the national level, India, China, the United States, and Pakistan had a higher burden of IHD. Furthermore, as the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) increased, the burden of IHD caused by a low ω-3 diet gradually decreased. CONCLUSION: This study untangles a significant association between a low ω-3 diet and the burden of IHD, emphasizing the importance of promoting healthy eating habits globally. Future research should further explore the impact of dietary changes on the burden of IHD and develop targeted public health policies to reduce the burden of IHD.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by a set of deficits not limited to social communication, which is restricted and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of autism has been seen to be consistently increasing globally. Autism is multifactorial in its etiology, and it involves several physiological systems, including the central nervous system and the gut-brain axis. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for neural development and functionality, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). They both play a crucial role in not only reducing the neuroinflammation associated with autism but also supporting cognitive processing as well. Given the low levels of omega-3 noted in ASD individuals, this systematic review aims to assess the influence of omega-3 supplementation on cognitive outcomes in children with ASD. The systematic review was done following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, where different databases were assessed across PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus. MeSH terms used included keywords \"Omega-3\", \"EPA\", \"DHA\" AND \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\" OR \"ASD\". Articles published between 2007 and 2023 that focused on ages 2 to 18 years were screened, and cognitive outcomes relevant to omega-3 supplementation were included. Studies with inadequate access to full text excluded non-human trials and older individuals. After generating 25,312 articles, 211 were selected for further review, with 11 meeting the inclusion criteria. The articles reviewed panned over five different countries that involved omega-3 supplementation lasting up to one year. Results suggested that DHA and EPA supplementation may improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive functioning in children with ASD. The prefrontal cortex development was associated with DHA supplementation, whereas EPA showed improved emotional regulation and reduced neuroinflammation. However, conclusive results were not reached as there was variability in study designs, different dosages, and assessment methods. The power of the studies conducted was also noted to be limited. While promising, extensive research and trials are required to standardize the dosage of omega-3 and the length of intervention. Future studies should aim to identify the long-term effects of omega-3 supplementation, understand the gut-brain axis, and investigate the combination of omega-3 with other therapies to improve cognitive functioning."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Physical function and physical activity (PA) are key drivers of health and autonomy at older age. We examined the effects of supplemental vitamin D3, supplemental marine omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3s), and a simple home exercise program (SHEP), alone or in combination, on change in physical function and PA among generally healthy older adults. DESIGN: Multi-center, 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design, randomized controlled trial, follow-up of three years METHODS: Self-reported PA and physical function were pre-defined outcomes of the DO-HEALTH trial, which included older adults (≥70 years) free of major comorbidities. The interventions were vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d), marine omega-3s (1 g/d), and a SHEP (3 × 30 min/wk), applied alone or in combination in eight treatment arms. The outcomes were change in PA (self-reported total PA, metabolic equivalent [MET] h/wk) and physical function (five times sit-to-stand test, hand grip strength, gait speed) from baseline to 12, 24 and 36 months. Mixed effect models were used and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, prior fall, time and baseline level of the outcome. RESULTS: All 2157 DO-HEALTH participants (mean age 75 years; 83% physically active; 59% vitamin D3 replete) were included. Baseline PA was 75 MET h/wk. Participants receiving omega-3s versus no omega-3s and randomized to SHEP versus control exercise did not differ in PA change over 3 years. However, participants receiving vitamin D3 compared to those receiving no vitamin D3 (Δadjusted means: -7.1 [95% CI -12.7, -1.5] MET h/wk, P = 0.01) showed a decline in PA. Results did not differ in subgroups by sex and age (70-74 yrs, ≥75 yrs). Vitamin D3, omega-3s or SHEP did not improve physical function. CONCLUSION: Among generally healthy, active, and largely vitamin D3 replete adults aged 70 years and older, vitamin D3, omega-3s and SHEP, individually and in combination had no benefits on self-reported PA and objectively measured physical function. The detrimental effect of vitamin D supplementation on PA change needs further examination."

We aimed to investigate the role of Wnt signaling, a pathway critical for brain development, in ADHD and to determine if modulation of this pathway using ω-3/6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may provide a beneficial treatment approach. Given the symptom heterogeneity in ADHD and the limited response to conventional therapies for some patients, we examined the effects of ω-3/6 PUFA treatment combined with Methylphenidate (MPH) on neurodevelopmental mechanisms using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NSCs, comparing controls to ADHD patients. Our results show that ω-3/6 PUFAs differentially regulate Wnt activity in NSCs depending on the patient's condition and the composition of the treatments. These findings highlight the potential of ω-3 PUFA treatment as personalized support for neurodevelopmental processes in ADHD. They also emphasize the importance of investigating ADHD subgroups, including those unresponsive to stimulant treatments, as they may exhibit distinct phenotypes.",

The reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a key therapy for preventing coronary artery disease (CAD), but the role of omega-3 fatty acids as residual risk factors of CAD remains controversial. We studied the correlation between serum omega-3 fatty acid levels and endothelial function in patients with CAD receiving statin therapy and examined the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) therapy on endothelial function. METHODS: A total of 150 consecutive patients with CAD receiving statin therapy (LDL-C levels < 100 mg/dL) were enrolled. Serum omega-3 fatty acid levels were measured, and endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. Subsequently, 65 patients with impaired FMD (<6%) and low EPA/arachidonic acid (AA) (<0.3) were administered EPA, and FMD was reassessed after 3 months. RESULTS: A multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that serum docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and EPA plus DHA levels were independent determinants of %FMD (β = 0.214 and 0.163, p < 0.05, respectively). The EPA therapy significantly improved %FMD (from 3.7 ± 1.0% to 4.1 ± 1.0%, p < 0.05) in patients with low EPA/AA, and especially in patients with low EPA/AA and high triglyceride levels (from 3.4 ± 1.0% to 4.0 ± 1.1%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Serum omega-3 fatty acid levels were associated with endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAD receiving statin therapy. EPA therapy improves endothelial function in patients with low EPA/AA, especially those with low EPA/AA and high triglycerides."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental disease that is characterized by depressive and manic episodes. Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are known therapies that work, but their restrictions and disadvantages resulted in the need for complementary and alternative therapies, such as natural compounds. Omega-3 fatty acids, as basic ingredients of fishes and seafood, play crucial roles in brain development, function of brain membrane enzymes, learning, and many other instances, and their deficiency has been associated with many mental diseases, including bipolar disorder. METHODS: The present narrative review aims to critically summarize and scrutinize the available clinical studies on the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the management and co-treatment of bipolar disorder episodes and symptoms. For this purpose, a thorough and in-depth search was performed in the most accurate scientific databases, e.g., PubMed., Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar, applying effective and relevant keywords. RESULTS: There are currently several clinical studies that assessed the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on the severity of BD symptoms. Some of them supported evidence for the potential beneficial impact of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in the prevention and/or co-treatment of bipolar disorder severity and symptomatology. Nevertheless, a considerable number of clinical studies did not show high efficiency, rendering the existing data rather conflicting. The above may be ascribed to the fact that there is a high heterogeneity amongst the available clinical studies concerning the dosage, the administration duration, the combination of fatty acids administration, the method designs and protocols, and the study populations. CONCLUSION: Although the currently available clinical evidence seems promising, it is highly recommended to accomplish larger, long-term, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials with a prospective design in order to derive conclusive results as to whether omega-fatty acids could act as a co-treatment agent or even as protective factors against bipolar disorder symptomatology. Drug design strategies could be developed to derive novel synthetic omega-3 fatty acids analogs, which could be tested for their potential to attenuate the severity of BD episodes and symptoms.",

The aim of this study is to explore the association between circulating FAs, genetic risk factors, and AD in adults. Utilizing the UK Biobank dataset, we evaluated the impacts of FAs on the risk of elderly-onset AD and explored the combined effects of FA levels and genetic susceptibility. Plasma omega-3 levels exhibited an inverse correlation with AD risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-0.98), regardless of genetic predisposition. Individuals with low genetic risk and high omega-3 levels had the lowest AD risk, a 38% reduction compared to the reference category. Additionally, individuals with GA/AA on rs1692120 exhibited a significantly elevated AD risk, whereas those with more A alleles for rs174448 demonstrated a significantly diminished AD risk (both p trends <0.05). These findings suggest that increasing omega-3 intake could be a preventive strategy against AD, and tailoring prevention strategies based on genetic predispositions may enhance intervention efficacy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as omega-3 (n-3), are essential in anti-inflammatory processes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a dietary intervention along with supplementation of 1.8 g of marine n-3 PUFAs on anthropometric, biochemical, and inflammatory markers in adults. METHODS: An 8-week double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted with a diet (200 kcal/day reduction each 4 weeks based on the estimated basal caloric expenditure) containing a n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio ≤ 5:1, along with daily 1.8 g of marine n-3 supplementation (EPA and DHA) vs. active placebo 1.6 g (ALA). A total of 40 subjects were included in the study, 21 in the marine omega-3 group and 19 in the active placebo group. Inclusion criteria included subjects aged 25 to 50 years with obesity as determined by body mass index (BMI) and/or abdominal obesity according to ATP III criteria. RESULTS: The marine omega-3 supplemented group had a better effect compared to the active placebo group, increasing Resolvin D1 [129.3 (-90.1-193.5) vs. -16.8 (-237.8-92.5) pg/mL, p = 0.041], IL-10 [1.4 (-0.7-4.6) vs. -2.0 (-5-0.05) pg/mL, p = 0.001], and decreasing IL-6 [-0.67 (2.72--0.59) vs. 0.03 (-0.59-1.84) pg/mL, p = 0.015], and MCP-1 [-29.6 (-94.9-5.50) vs. 18.3 (-97.3-66.35) pg/mL, p = 0.040]. CONCLUSIONS: A diet supplemented with marine n-3 improves inflammatory markers by increasing systemic levels of Resolvin D1 and IL-10 and decreasing IL-6 and MCP-1."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3-FAs) represent a group of essential nutrients, but modern diets often do not allow for a balanced ratio between the intakes of ω-6-FA and ω-3-FA, which is vital for health. ω-3-FA can be found primarily in algae and fish, while the intake of ω-3-FA dietary supplements can be seen as an efficient way of providing nutrients important for many physiological functions. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to investigate the use of ω-3-FA-rich food and supplements, as well as the knowledge and attitudes on these nutrients among residents of the central Balkans-the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Srpska. METHODS: The research was performed as a prospective, cross-section, online survey. RESULTS: A total of 895 responses were collected, with relatively high usage of ω-3-FA supplements (34.2%). It was found that the respondents use these supplements due to inadequate dietary intake, but also in therapy or prevention of certain diseases and conditions. Users take the supplements on a regular basis, although for short periods of time. The respondents reported the dietary intake of food rich in ω-3-FA. It was found that more than half of parents give these supplements to their children, with similar purposes, although more frequently and for longer periods of time. The use of ω-3-FA via supplements in pregnant and breastfeeding women is also present. CONCLUSIONS: The residents of the investigated territory seem to have an awareness of the importance of ω-3-FA use, with its consumption being registered in both the general population and specific subpopulations. Future steps would include further promotion and education on the given topic.",

      "abstract": "Two large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials-REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH-have garnered significant attention in cardiovascular medicine. Both trials aimed to evaluate the effects of prolonged administration of nutritional lipids, specifically omega-3 fatty acids, on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in high-risk patients undergoing statin therapy. REDUCE-IT used eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester with mineral oil as a control, while STRENGTH utilized a carboxylic acid formulation of both EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with corn oil as a control. Notably, REDUCE-IT demonstrated a reduction in MACE risk with EPA, whereas STRENGTH showed no such benefit with the combination of EPA and DHA. Despite extensive and insightful discussions following the publication of these trials, the underlying reasons for this discrepancy remain elusive. We posit that further investigation into resting heart rate (RHR), heart rate variability (HRV), and ethnic subgroup data-collected but not fully explored-is critical to unraveling the divergent outcomes of the REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH trials. These additional analyses could provide pivotal insights into the mechanisms driving the differential effects of omega-3 fatty acids in high-risk cardiovascular patients. Given that previous discussions have not fully addressed these potential variables, exploring them may illuminate unexplored pathways and offer a deeper understanding of the mechanistic and clinical roles of omega-3 s in cardiovascular health. We hypothesize that by delving into these under-analyzed factors, we can not only clarify the discrepancies between the trials but also advance our broader understanding of cardiovascular nutrition and medicine."

METHODS: Forty-one patients with diabetes (35‒67 years old) and periodontal disease were assigned to four groups: C: control (n=12), I1: omega-3 (n=10, 1 g), I2: cranberry juice (n=9, 200 mL), and I3: cranberry juice enriched with omega-3 (n=10, 200 mL, containing 1 g of omega-3) twice daily for 8 weeks. Serum and salivary total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), serum uric acid, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), pocket depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque index were evaluated in all the subjects before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Serum and salivary TAC increased, and salivary MDA decreased in the I3 group compared with the control group. Additionally, serum MDA decreased in the I2 and I3 groups while serum TAC increased. Serum hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α decreased in the I3 group compared with the baseline. Furthermore, serum hs-CRP and IL-6 decreased in the I3 group compared with the control group. After the intervention, PD and CAL significantly reduced in all the groups. CONCLUSION: The consumption of cranberry juice enriched with omega-3 can be helpful as adjuvant therapy with non-surgical periodontal treatment in decreasing serum levels of IL-6 and hs-CRP, as well as serum and salivary levels of MDA while also increasing serum and salivary levels of TAC."

      "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a devastating malignancy in great need of new and more effective treatment approaches. In recent years, studies have indicated that nutritional interventions, particularly nutraceuticals, may provide novel avenues to modulate cancer progression. Here, our study characterizes the impact of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, as a nutraceutical intervention in pancreatic cancer using a genetically engineered mouse model driven by KrasG12D and Trp53R172H. This model closely resembles human pancreatic carcinogenesis, offering a disease relevant platform for translational research. Our findings showed that ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intervention (using a diet supplemented with 6% cod liver oil) significantly reduced tumor volume as well as lung and liver metastasis and a trend toward improved survival rate compared with control treated mice. This antitumoral effect was accompanied by distinct changes in tumor membrane fatty acid profile and eicosanoids release. Furthermore, the eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid intervention also reduced malignant histological parameters and induced apoptosis without affecting cell proliferation. Of note is the significant reduction in tumor fibrosis that was associated with decreased levels of Sonic Hedgehog, a major ligand controlling this cellular compartment in pancreatic cancer. All together our results demonstrate the impact of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid as antitumor regulators in pancreatic cancer, suggesting potential for ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as a possible antitumoral dietary intervention. This research opens new avenues for integrating nutraceutical strategies in pancreatic cancer management.",

Despite its importance and impact worldwide, no treatment options are currently available to help protect or preserve brain structure and function following injury. In this review, we discuss the potential benefits of using omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3 PUFAs) as therapeutic agents in the context of TBI in the paediatric and adult populations. Methods: Preclinical and clinical research reports investigating the effects of O3 PUFA-based interventions on the consequences of TBI were retrieved and reviewed, and the evidence presented and discussed. Results: A range of animal models of TBI, types of injury, and O3 PUFA dosing regimens and administration protocols have been used in different strategies to investigate the effects of O3 PUFAs in TBI. Most evidence comes from preclinical studies, with limited clinical data available thus far. Overall, research indicates that high O3 PUFA levels help lessen the harmful effects of TBI by reducing tissue damage and cell loss, decreasing associated neuroinflammation and the immune response, which in turn moderates the severity of the associated neurological dysfunction. Conclusions: Data from the studies reviewed here indicate that O3 PUFAs could substantially alleviate the impact of traumatic injuries in the central nervous system, protect structure and help restore function in both the immature and adult brains.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have reported inconsistent findings regarding omega-3 fatty acids' protective role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We investigated their association in a prospective cohort and examined causality using Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study and 2-sample MR analyses. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort included 258 350 AMD-free individuals of European descent from the UK Biobank. Mendelian randomization analyses used genome-wide association study data on plasma omega-3 and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (UK Biobank, n = 115 006) and AMD (dry, wet, and any; FinnGen, n = 208 690-209 122). METHODS: Cox regression assessed the association between plasma omega-3 and DHA levels and AMD incidence, adjusting for systemic covariates and AMD polygenetic risk score (PRS). Interaction effects of AMD genetic risk (PRS, complement factor H and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 genotypes), and plasma omega-3 and DHA levels were tested. For MR analyses, we used random-effect inverse-variance weighted model as primary, with 5 sensitivity models. Causality was considered significant if P < 0.05 in the primary model and at least 2 sensitivity models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of AMD. RESULTS: Over 12.9 years, 5068 people (1.9%) demonstrated AMD. Higher plasma levels (in millimoles per liter) of omega-3 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.95; P = 0.006) and DHA (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96; P = 0.029) were associated with lower risk of receiving an AMD diagnosis. Mendelian randomization showed genetic predisposition to higher plasma omega-3 levels reduced the risk of dry AMD (odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = 0.010), wet AMD (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.88; P < 0.001), and any AMD (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < 0.001). Similar results were found for plasma DHA levels (wet AMD:OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.96; P = 0.017; any AMD: OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98; P = 0.030). No significant interaction was found between omega-3 and DHA levels and AMD genetic risk (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both the prospective and MR analyses suggest omega-3 and DHA may protect against AMD, supporting the need for further clinical trials to test their effectiveness in AMD prevention and treatment.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sclerostin, procollagen type 1 N propeptide (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide (β-CTx) levels were pre-defined secondary outcomes of DO-HEALTH, a double blind, randomized controlled trial in healthy physically active older adults in five European countries. OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in yearly serum sclerostin, P1NP and β-CTx levels over 3 years, adjusted for age, sex, prior falls, study site, baseline BMI, and baseline level of the respective outcome. RESULTS: 1,848 participants were included (mean age 74.8 ± 4.4 years, 58.9 % women, 41.4 % 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL, 83.9 % at least moderately physically active at baseline). Vitamin D3 and omega-3s supplementation alone did not change sclerostin levels significantly, while SHEP compared with control exercise (joint mobility) led to greater decrease in sclerostin levels [-1.56 pmol/L (-2.54, -0.58), p=0.002]. Omega-3s plus SHEP led to a greater decrease in sclerostin levels compared to no omega-3s/control exercise [-1.93pmol/L (-3.31, -0.54), p=0.007]. For P1NP and β-CTx there were no significant effects for any of the individual treatments and treatment combinations. CONCLUSIONS: In this 3-year prevention trial among largely vitamin D replete adults age 70 and older, SHEP alone or in combination with omega-3s reduced serum sclerostin levels, while vitamin D3 and omega-3s alone did not affect serum sclerostin levels."

      "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing β cells of the pancreas. Omega-3 fatty acids protect β cells and reduce the incidence of T1D, but the mechanism is poorly understood. We have shown that omega-3 fatty acids reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated β-cell apoptosis by upregulating the expression of the ADP-ribosylhydrolase ARH3. Here, we further investigate the β-cell protection mechanism of ARH3 by performing siRNA analysis of its gene Adprhl2 in MIN6 insulin-producing cells, subsequent treatment with a cocktail of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β + IFN-γ + TNF-α, followed by proteomics analysis. ARH3 regulated proteins from several pathways related to the nucleus (splicing, RNA surveillance, and nucleocytoplasmic transport), mitochondria (metabolic pathways), and endoplasmic reticulum (protein folding). ARH3 also regulated the levels of proteins related to antigen processing and presentation, and the chemokine-signaling pathway. We further studied the role of ARH3 in regulating the chemokine CXCL9. We found that ARH3 reduces the cytokine-induced expression of CXCL9, which is dependent on omega-3 fatty acids. In conclusion, we demonstrate that omega-3 fatty acids regulate CXCL9 expression via ARH3, which may have a role in protecting β cells from immune attack thereby preventing T1D development. Significance of the Study: Omega-3 fatty acids have a variety of health benefits. In type 1 diabetes, omega-3 fatty acids reduce the islet autoimmune response and the disease development. Here, we studied the pathways regulated by the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylhydrolase ARH3, a protein whose expression is regulated by omega-3 fatty acids. We showed that ARH3 reduces the expression of chemokines in response to omega-3 fatty acids. This represents an anti-inflammatory mechanism of omega-3 fatty acids that might be involved with protection against type 1 diabetes development.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several mechanisms have been proposed for the brain uptake of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3), including passive diffusion of the unesterified form and the use of Mfsd2a transporter for the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) form. We hypothesize that the accumulation of LPC n-3 in the brain is lower in mice carrying the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor for developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease in humans. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether two or four months of supplementation with LPC n-3 increases the levels of docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) in the frontal cortex of APOE3 and APOE4 mice. METHODS: APOE3 and APOE4 mice were administered LPC n-3 (9.6 mg DHA + 18.3 mg EPA) or sunflower oil (control) by oral gavage for two or four months (n = 5-8 per genotype, per treatment, and per treatment duration). At the end of the treatment period, frontal cortices were collected, and their FA profiles analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. RESULTS: After two months of gavage with LPC n-3, APOE3 mice showed increased levels of EPA in their cortex, but not DHA. In APOE4 mice, neither EPA nor DHA levels were significantly affected. After four months of LPC n-3, both APOE3 and APOE4 mice exhibited higher EPA levels, while changes in DHA levels were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: LPC n-3 supplementation increased EPA, but not DHA, levels in the frontal cortex of mice in a duration- and APOE genotype-dependent manner. Further research is needed to explore the implications for brain health.",

      "abstract": "The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids in broiler chickens exposed to high stocking density (SD) on growth performance, carcass characteristics, breast meat quality, blood biochemical indices, nutrient digestibility and litter quality. A total of 420 one-day-old broilers were used in 2 × 2 factorial arrangements with 2 levels of SD (low: 9 birds/ m2 and high: 17 birds/ m2) and 2 levels of omega-3 fatty acids (low and high omega-3; 0.057 and 0.5% of the diet, respectively) in a completely randomized design with 5 replicates for each treatment. Live body weight (LBW), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded periodically. The apparent metabolizable energy (AME), digestibility of crude protein (CP), organic matter (OM), and lipid of experimental diets, were measured from days 30 to 37 of age. The results showed that body weight gain (BWG) and FCR was improved (P < 0.05) in high SD broilers during the grower phase (days 15-24).The BWG of broilers under high SD and dietary omega-3 fatty acids was higher than others (P < 0.05) during the finisher phase (d 25-40). Carcass and total heart weight were higher in birds fed diets containing omega-3 fatty acids under high SD than in birds fed a diet low in omega-3 fatty acids at low or high SD (P < 0.05). The serum concentration of cholesterol in broilers with high SD fed diets high in omega-3 fatty acids was lower than broilers with high SD fed diets low in omega-3 fatty acids (P < 0.05). High SD decreased AME and CP digestibility (P < 0.05). Dietary omega-3 fatty acids, increased AME and digestibility of OM and lipid (P < 0.05). In broiler chickens raised at low stocking density, feeding a high-omega-3 diet reduced litter nitrogen levels compared to feeding a low omega-3 diet (P < 0.05). In summary, omega-3 fatty acid may have the potential to reduce negative effects of high SD on broiler production by enhancing the nutrient digestibility and litter quality.",

There is limited evidence on the potential nutritional intervention to complement active oncological treatment strategies in breast cancer (BC) patients in developing countries. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of omega-3 fatty acids (ω3) and vitamin D3 (VitD) supplementations on the QoL and blood inflammation markers of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assessed among women newly diagnosed with BC in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. METHODS: A total of 88 BC women were randomly assigned into one of four groups: i) omega-3 fatty acid (ω3) group; ii) vitamin D (VitD) group; iii) ω3+VitD group, and iv) the control. Participants were received either two 300 mg ω3 capsules daily, or one 50,000IU VitD tablet weekly, or both supplementation for 9-weeks. The QoL status was assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) instruments of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 tools, while blood inflammatory markers of TNF-α hsCRP were used. All measurements were taken from baseline to the end of the intervention period. The detailed procedures of the present study were registered on ClinicalTrial.gov with the identifier NCT05331807. RESULTS: At the end of the trial, participants in the ω3+VitD group showed a significant increase in overall global health status (p < 0.01) compared to other groups. Additionally, this group showed significantly higher functional scores (all p < 0.05) and lower scores for fatigue (p < 0.01), nausea and vomiting, pain, and appetite loss (all p < 0.05) at the end of the trial compared to baseline. Furthermore, comparisons between the intervention groups revealed a significant difference in blood concentrations of TNF-α and hsCRP (p < 0.05). These significant differences were identified in hsCRP between ω3 and control groups (p < 0.01). The ω3+VitD group demonstrated a significant reduction in both hsCRP and TNF-α levels (both p < 0.05) from baseline. No significant changes in blood inflammatory markers were observed within the ω3 or VitD groups alone. CONCLUSION: Participants receiving daily ω3 and weekly VitD supplementation for 9 weeks showed a significant improved in QoL and blood inflammation markers among the newly diagnosed BC during their chemotherapy treatment.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in body composition, specifically on the lean body mass and fat mass in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a total of 120 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients were randomly allocated into two groups. The intervention group has taken three grams of omega-3 fatty acids daily while the placebo group received three grams of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) as a placebo for a total of 2 months. The changes in the body mass index (BMI) and body composition (fat mass, muscle, and visceral fat) were assessed at baseline and following the intervention. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the mean of BMI, FAT, muscle, and visceral fat in the intervention group compared to the control group after the intervention. After two months of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, the study found no statistically significant impact of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on various indices of body composition. The effect of ω-3 supplementation in reducing visceral fat was close to significant (p=0.08). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in improving anthropometric measurements in patients with CKD, except a partial effect on visceral fat. Further large-scale and long-term clinical trials are needed to confirm the present results.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of fish oil-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) on gut microbiota and serum lipid metabolites in T2DM. METHODS: In a three-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 110 T2DM patients received either fish oil (n = 55) or corn oil (n = 55) capsules daily. Serum lipids, glycemic parameters, gut microbiota diversity, and lipidomics were assessed. RESULTS: This study found that fish oil-derived omega-3 PUFAs intervention did not significantly lower the fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with the baseline level (p > 0.05). However, serum fasting blood glucose (p = 0.039), glycosylated hemoglobin levels (p = 0.048), HOMA-IR (p = 0.022), total cholesterol (p < 0.001), triglyceride (p = 0.034), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.048), and non-HDL levels (p = 0.046) were significantly lower in the fish oil group compared with the corn oil group after three months of intervention. Also, it altered glycerophospholipid metabolism and gut microbiota. After three months, the fish oil group showed a significantly lower abundance of Desulfobacterota compared with the corn oil control group (p = 0.003), with reduced levels of Colidextribacter (p = 0.002), Ralstonia (p = 0.021), and Klebsiella (p = 0.013). Conversely, the abundance of Limosilactobacillus (p = 0.017), Lactobacillus (p = 0.011), and Haemophilus (p = 0.018) increased significantly. In addition, relevant glycolipid metabolism indicators showed significant correlations with the altered profiles of serum lipid metabolites, intestinal bacteria, and fungi. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the impact of fish oil-derived omega-3 PUFAs on intestinal microbiota structure and function in patients with type 2 diabetes. The observed decrease in pathogenic bacterial species and the enhancement of beneficial species may have significant implications for gut health and systemic inflammation, both of which are pivotal in managing diabetes. Further research is warranted to comprehensively elucidate the long-term benefits and underlying mechanisms of these microbiota alterations.",

However, there have been a few double-blind randomized controlled trials focused on n-3 PUFAs as monotherapy in MDD, and the outcomes have been mixed. This study aimed to assess the clinical effects of n-3 PUFAs monotherapy in patients with MDD. METHODS: A total of 60 patients with MDD participated in this 12-week double-blind randomized controlled trial. They were randomized to either the n-3 PUFAs group (n = 30; 3.2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid, DHA per day) or the placebo group (n = 30; 3.2 g of soybean oil per day). The severity of depression was evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). RESULTS: The n-3 PUFAs group had a significantly lower HRSD score compared with the placebo group at week 4 (p = 0.004), week 6 (p = 0.006), week 8 (p = 0.004), and week 12 (p = 0.01). The n-3 PUFAs group showed slightly higher rates for both remission (26.7% vs. 10%, p = 0.095) and response (23.3% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.145) compared with the placebo group at week 12, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that monotherapy of n-3 PUFAs could improve depression and potentially serve as an alternative option for MDD patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The double-blind, 2 × 2 factorial design, placebo-controlled ASCEND randomized trial compared the effects of 100 mg aspirin daily and, separately, 1 g omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) daily on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 15,480 UK adults with diabetes. We report the effects of these randomized treatment allocations on scores derived from the National Eye Institute's Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) in a subset of participants involved in the ASCEND-Eye sub-study. METHODS: Ordinal data from the NEI-VFQ-25 were analyzed using proportional odds regression methods. A common odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to interpret the average effect size of randomization to each study treatment on composite and subdomain scores from the questionnaire. RESULTS: Neither randomization to aspirin nor omega-3 FAs for 7.5 years significantly affected composite or subdomain scores from the NEI-VFQ-25. CONCLUSION: Applying the NEI-VFQ-25 in ASCEND-Eye represents one of the largest surveys of vision-targeted health-related quality of life in people with diabetes. Further observational analyses of these data are planned, to identify the clinical and demographic characteristics associated with lower composite and subdomain scores in a diabetic population.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Growing evidence emphasizes the importance of xanthophyll carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids in eye health. However, the beneficial effects of such supplementation have not been thoroughly discussed among adults with high screen exposure. Current trial evidence on lutein bioavailability is contradictory, and the interactions of dietary intervention with host-related factors remain elusive. This study aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness of supplementation with macular xanthophylls and omega-3 fatty acids on macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and visual function, access the bioavailability of free lutein and lutein ester, and explore the complex interplay between genetic variations, intestinal microbiota, and the dietary intervention in Chinese adults with long-term exposure to digital devices. METHODS: The Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Omega-3 (LZO) clinical trial is a 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 600 participants recruited from research centers, universities, and communities. Individuals are eligible to participate if they are aged over 18 years and use digital devices for over 8 h daily in the last 2 years, and will be randomized to six arms. A total of three visits will be scheduled at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in MPOD over the 24-week intervention. The secondary outcomes are changes in visual function (visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, contrast and glare sensitivity, critical flicker fusion, reaction time, visuognosis persistence, symptoms and signs of dry eye, retinal thickness, and optical quality), and changes in serum lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations, and erythrocyte membrane omega-3 fatty acids. Genetic variations will be determined using genome-wide genotyping at baseline. 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be utilized to assess microbiome compositional changes before and after intervention. DISCUSSION: The trial is anticipated to establish early interventions to prevent photochemical ocular damage and delay the onset of vision impairment in young adults with long-term repeated exposure to screen-based electronic devices, and provide valuable insights for the development of precision nutrition strategies for maintaining eye health.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal high-fat diet (HFD) during pregnancy and lactation induces depression- like phenotype and provokes myelin-related changes in rat offspring in the prefrontal cortex (PFCTX), which persist even to adulthood. OBJECTIVE: Due to the plasticity of the developing brain, it was decided to analyze whether depressionlike phenotype and myelin-related changes in the early lifetime induced by maternal HFD (60% energy from fat) could be reversed by the omega-3 fatty acid-enriched diet (Ω3D) given from the postweaning period until adulthood (63rd day of life) in offspring. METHODS: We analyzed the effect of post-weaning Ω3D on the depressive-like phenotype (assessed by the forced swimming test) and myelin-related changes (measured using RT-qPCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence staining) in the PFCTX of adult offspring. RESULTS: Ω3D reversed increased immobility time in adult offspring induced by maternal HFD, without affecting the animals' locomotor activity. Molecularly, Ω3D normalized the reduced expression levels of myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), as well as myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL) in males and MOG in females in the PFCTX, changes initially induced by maternal HFD. Additionally, Ω3D normalized the quantity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes in the prelimbic, infralimbic, and cingulate cortex in males, which were reduced following maternal HFD exposure. In females, the Ω3D effect was less pronounced, with normalization of oligodendrocyte precursors occurring only in the infralimbic cortex. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Ω3D may play a significant role in correcting behavioral and neurobiological changes caused by adverse prenatal conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive disorder characterised by stenosis or occlusion of arteries, or both, due to arteriosclerosis. Intermittent claudication (IC) and diminished walking ability are often present as the main symptoms of PAD. Omega-3 fatty acids have been used in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease, although current evidence suggests they may be of limited benefit. Peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease share a similar pathogenesis. It is uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acids benefit people with IC. This is an update of the review first published in 2004 and updated in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in people with intermittent claudication. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods, and searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register via the Cochrane Register of Studies, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, and two trials registers on 19 April 2024. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of omega-3 fatty acids versus placebo or non-omega-3 fatty acids in people with intermittent claudication. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were quality of life, pain-free walking distance, and maximal walking distance. Secondary outcomes were ankle-brachial index, revascularisation procedures in the lower limb, amputation rate/frequency, lipid levels, blood pressure, all-cause and vascular mortality, non-fatal vascular events, and adverse effects of therapy. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 RCTs (1830 participants) comparing omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with placebo or alternative therapies. The follow-up was four weeks to six years. The majority of the studies had unclear risk of bias, and many could not be included in our meta-analysis, so were reported narratively. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on quality of life. One study measured quality of life but did not present any data. The study authors reported there was no improvement in any of the eight self-reported quality-of-life parameters in the SF-36 questionnaire between entry and 16 weeks for the intervention group. No results were presented for the control group (very low-certainty evidence). Omega-3 fatty acids may result in little to no effect on pain-free walking distance (mean difference (MD) 1.01 metre (m), 95% confidence interval (CI) -34.23 to 36.24; 3 studies, 147 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or maximal walking distance (MD -4.18 m, 95% CI -37.10 to 28.74; 3 studies, 164 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Omega-3 compared with a control may have little to no effect on ankle-brachial index (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.04; 3 studies, 168 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study assessed the incidence of revascularisation procedures (lower limb angioplasty/bypass surgery) and rate of amputation (progression of critical limb ischaemia/amputation) in the lower limb. Results showed that omega-3 may have little to no effect on either outcome (very low-certainty evidence). Seven studies reported adverse events. Details of reporting varied amongst studies, and we were unable to combine the results. A total of 47 adverse effects were reported in the intervention groups compared to 33 events in the control groups (7 studies, 488 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that omega-3 results in little to no difference in adverse events. Meta-analyses showed no differences between intervention and placebo groups for cholesterol, triglycerides, or blood pressure. Two studies assessed mortality. All-cause mortality and vascular mortality were reported by one study, and vascular mortality by another. We were unable to pool the studies, but both studies individually reported there were no differences between the omega-3 and the control groups. There was no difference between the intervention and placebo groups for the incidence of non-fatal coronary events (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.60; 2 studies, 141 participants), or the incidence of non-fatal stroke/transient ischaemic attack (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.13 to 6.77; 2 studies, 110 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of omega-3 fatty acids in people with intermittent claudication on quality of life, walking distance (pain-free or maximal), ankle-brachial index, and the incidence of revascularisation procedures or frequency of amputation in the lower limb. The evidence suggests that omega-3 results in little to no difference in adverse events. Further high-quality research is needed to fully evaluate short- and long-term effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the most clinically relevant outcomes in people with intermittent claudication.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES: In the past 2 decades, substantial effort has been put into research on therapeutic options for people at ultra-high risk (UHR) for developing a first episode of psychosis (FEP), focusing on omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in preventing transition to psychosis. Despite an initial positive finding, subsequent studies failed to find a beneficial effect. The current study aimed to further investigate the effect of omega-3 PUFAs in UHR, to determine whether this line of research is worth pursuing. STUDY DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study testing the efficacy of 6-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs in 135 subjects at UHR for FEP, aged 13 to 20 years on the prevention of a transition to psychosis, followed up for 18 months post-treatment. The trial was conducted at 16 general hospitals and psychiatric specialty centers located in 8 European countries and Israel. STUDY RESULTS: There was no beneficial effect of treatment with omega-3 PUFAs compared to placebo; the rate of transition over 2 years did not differ between treatment arms nor was there a difference in change in symptom severity after 6-month treatment. Dropout rates and serious adverse events were similar across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the third study that fails to replicate the original finding on the protective effect of omega-3 PUFAs in UHR subjects for transition to psychosis. The accumulating evidence therefore suggests that omega-3 PUFAs do not reduce transition rates to psychosis in those at increased risk at 2 years follow-up.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has highlighted the acute and chronic impact of repetitive subconcussive head impacts (rSHIs) in contact sports. Neurofilament-light (Nf-L), a brain-derived biomarker of neuroaxonal injury, elevates in concert with rSHI. Recently, long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC ω-3 PUFAs) supplementation has been suggested to mitigate brain injury from rSHI as reflected by attenuation of Nf-L concentrations within contact sport athletes. OBJECTIVE: Using a systematic review with a meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the effect of LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation on Nf-L concentrations in athletes routinely exposed to rSHI. METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed and CINAHL) were searched from inception through January 2024. One-stage meta-analysis of individual participant-level data was used to detect changes in Nf-L concentrations between LC ω-3 PUFA and control/placebo (PL) groups from baseline to midseason (MS) and postseason (PS). Least square means (±SE) for Nf-L change from baseline were compared by treatment group for MS/PS using contrast t tests. Significance was set a priori at adjusted P ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Of 460 records identified, 3 studies in collegiate American football players (n = 179; LC ω-3 PUFA = 105, PL = 71) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with PL, the change in Nf-L concentrations was statistically similar at MS [mean difference (MD) = -1.66 ± 0.82 pg·mL-1, adjusted P = 0.09] and significantly lower at PS (MD = -2.23 ± 0.83 pg·mL-1, adjusted P = 0.02) in athletes following LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate preliminary support for the prophylactic administration of LC ω-3 PUFA in contact sport athletes exposed to rSHI; however, further research is required to determine the effective dosage required.This trial was registered at OSF (DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EY5QW)."

      "abstract": "AIM: This study aims to compare the effectiveness of \"omega-3 fatty acids\" as an auxiliary to \"scaling and root planing (SRP)\" with traditional \"scaling and root planing\" in periodontal treatment in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a randomized control trial and was carried out over a period of 3 months (registered on 02/07/2023). Thirty patients were singled out according to the inclusion criteria, each having periodontitis (Stage II Grade B), and were arbitrarily distributed into two groups (control and test). The test group was treated with \"scaling and root planing\" along with the adjunctive application of \"omega-3 fatty acids\" while the control group was treated with \"scaling and root planing\" alone. Monthly follow-up was carried out over 90 days. Clinical parameters such as pocket probing depth (PPD), gingival index (GI), bleeding index (BI), and plaque index (PI) were measured respectively at baseline and 3 months. The data was recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The soft tissue architecture remained stable. The mean full mouth plaque index (FMPI) score was statistically significant (p < 0.001) when the control group was compared to the test group with a mean difference of 0.12 ± 0.02. The mean full mouth papillary bleeding index (FMPBI) score decreased at 3 months and was statistically significant compared to baseline with a mean difference of 0.24 ± 0.04 (p < 0.001). When the test group was compared with the control group, the FMGI was not significant (p = 0.02), with a mean difference of 0.16 ± 0.19. The PPD was not significant (p =1) when comparing both the groups, with a mean difference of 0 ± 0.66. Although the clinical parameters were statistically significant at 3 months when compared to baseline in both the groups, the FMGI and PPD were not significant. CONCLUSION: The combined action of using omega-3 fatty acid as an auxiliary to conventional scaling and root planing improved the periodontal parameters including both the soft and hard tissue outcomes. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present study indicated that supplementary usage of omega-3 fatty acids is more beneficial for treating chronic and mild periodontitis than scaling and root planing alone. Omega-3 fatty acids can be used as energy for our cells, reduce the risk of blood clotting, maintain bone health, regulate metabolism, and reduce inflammation. Host modulatory therapy (HMT) with omega-3 fatty acids aims at reducing inflammation. With HMT as an adjunct, a better result of periodontal therapy was expected. It enhanced the positive effects on periodontal parameters and both the soft and hard tissue outcomes. How to cite this article: Salian S, Dhadse PV, Patil R, et al.

      "abstract": "Acute cartilage injuries, such as intra-articular fractures and blunt impacts, frequently result in chondrocyte death and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, significantly elevating the risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Despite advances in treatment, no effective therapies currently exist to fully cure PTOA or halt its progression. This study explores the protective effects of the dietary fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on human primary chondrocytes (HPCs) and cartilage explants exposed to mechanical overload and blunt trauma. HPCs were isolated and subjected to mechanical stretching using BioFlex six-well culture plates, while cartilage explants were subjected to impact loading via a customized drop tower. EPA was incorporated into the culture medium, followed by assays to evaluate cell viability, calcium (Ca²⁺) influx, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and collagen type II alpha (Col-2a) expression. EPA treatment markedly decreased chondrocyte mechanical sensitivity, as demonstrated by enhanced cell viability and reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Furthermore, EPA inhibited Piezo1 activation, leading to lower intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations, decreased apoptosis, and diminished ROS levels. In cartilage explants, EPA improved chondrocyte viability, minimized structural damage, and sustained higher Col-2a expression compared to the blunt trauma group. These results indicate that EPA effectively shields chondrocytes and cartilage explants from mechanical overload-induced damage by inhibiting Piezo1 activation and mitigating Ca²⁺ influx, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. The findings suggest that EPA supplementation could offer a promising strategy for preventing PTOA progression following acute cartilage injuries. Further research is warranted to assess the clinical applications of EPA and confirm its efficacy in larger animal models and human trials.",

      "abstract": "The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) exert multiple cardioprotective effects, influencing inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial function and lipid metabolism, besides their well-established triglyceride lowering properties. It is not uncommon for omega-3 PUFAs to be prescribed for hypertriglyceridemia, alongside antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. In this regard, we studied the effect of EPA and DHA, in combination with antiplatelet drugs, in platelet aggregation and P-selectin and αIIbβ3 membrane expression. The antiplatelet drugs aspirin and triflusal, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1); ticagrelor, an inhibitor of the receptor P2Y12; vorapaxar, an inhibitor of the PAR-1 receptor, were combined with DHA or EPA and evaluated against in vitro platelet aggregation induced by agonists arachidonic acid (AA), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and TRAP-6. We further investigated procaspase-activating compound 1 (PAC-1) binding and P-selectin membrane expression in platelets stimulated with ADP and TRAP-6. Both DHA and EPA displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation induced by AA, ADP and TRAP-6. In platelet aggregation induced by AA, DHA significantly improved acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and triflusal's inhibitory activity, while EPA enhanced the inhibitory effect of ASA. In combination with EPA, ASA and ticagrelor expressed an increased inhibitory effect towards ADP-induced platelet activation. Both fatty acids could not improve the inhibitory effect of vorapaxar on AA- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the presence of EPA, all antiplatelet drugs displayed a stronger inhibitory effect towards TRAP-6-induced platelet activation. Both omega-3 PUFAs inhibited the membrane expression of αIIbβ3, though they had no effect on P-selectin expression induced by ADP or TRAP-6. The antiplatelet drugs exhibited heterogeneity regarding their effect on P-selectin and αIIbβ3 membrane expression, while both omega-3 PUFAs inhibited the membrane expression of αIIbβ3, though had no effect on P-selectin expression induced by ADP or TRAP-6. The combinatory effect of DHA and EPA with the antiplatelet drugs did not result in enhanced inhibitory activity compared to the sum of the individual effects of each component.",

However, the existing approaches for periodontitis do not allow complete control of the disease. In this regard, an active search is being carried out both in preclinical and clinical studies for new approaches based, among other things, on nutraceuticals. Aim: This systematic review aimed to summarize and systematize data from preclinical studies on the effects of the use of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids in experimentally induced periodontitis. Methods: A systematic search for research articles was performed using electronic scientific databases. Only original in vivo experimental studies investigating the use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in experimentally induced periodontitis were included. Quality and risk of bias assessment (Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation) and quality of evidence assessment (using the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach) were performed. Results: Nineteen studies were included in this systematic review. It has been shown that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may decrease the progression of periodontitis with amelioration of alveolar bone loss along with decreased pro-inflammatory response and inhibition of osteoclasts. Despite the promising results, most of the analyzed studies were characterized by low to moderate quality and a significant risk of bias. Conclusion: Based on the retrieved data, the possibility of extrapolating the obtained results to humans is limited, indicating the need for additional studies to elucidate the key patterns and mechanisms of action of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their endogenous metabolites in experimentally induced periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study investigates the association between dietary Omega-3 fatty acid intake and accelerated phenotypic aging, referred to as PhenoAgeAccel. PhenoAgeAccel is defined as the difference between phenotypic biological age, calculated using blood biochemical markers, and chronological age. This study assesses the potential of Omega-3 intake to slow biological aging and its implications for public health. METHODS: Utilizing data from the NHANES from 1999 to 2018, this cross-sectional study included 20,337 adult participants. Through a nationally representative sample combined with comprehensive phenotypic age calculation methods, a cross-sectional analysis of Omega-3 fatty acid intake and accelerated phenotypic aging was conducted. Weighted generalized linear regression models and restricted cubic spline analyses were applied to explore the potential non-linear relationships between them. Threshold effects were further clarified through piecewise regression models, and the impact of different demographic and health characteristics was evaluated through interaction effect tests. RESULTS: After adjusting for various potential confounding factors, a significant negative correlation was found between Omega-3 fatty acid intake and PhenoAgeAccel (β = -0.071; 95% CI: -0.119, -0.024; p = 0.004), indicating that an increase in Omega-3 intake is associated with a slowdown in PhenoAgeAccel. Specifically, for each unit increase in Omega-3 intake, the accelerated phenotypic aging decreased by an average of 0.071 units, revealing a significant linear negative correlation between Omega-3 intake and PhenoAgeAccel. Moreover, threshold effect analysis identified an Omega-3 fatty acid intake threshold (1.103 grams/day), beyond which the impact of Omega-3 intake on accelerated phenotypic aging tends to stabilize. Additionally, factors such as gender, age, race, and hypertension may influence the relationship between Omega-3 intake and PhenoAgeAccel, suggesting individual dietary guidance needs in different populations. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential role of dietary Omega-3 fatty acids in regulating PhenoAgeAccel and supports the strategy of delaying the aging process through dietary interventions to increase Omega-3 intake. The findings of this study contributes to the development of precise nutritional intervention strategies for different populations to optimize healthy longevity."

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that impacts women of reproductive age. In addition to reproductive and psychological complications, women with PCOS are also at a higher risk of developing metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While weight reduction can help manage these complications in overweight or obese women, many weight loss interventions have been ineffective due to weight stigma and its psychological impact on women with PCOS. Therefore, exploring alternative dietary strategies which do not focus on weight loss per se is of importance. In this regard, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin (n-3 PUFAs), which are known for their hypotriglyceridemic, cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, have emerged as a potential therapy for prevention and reversal of metabolic complications in PCOS. Several clinical trials showed that n-3 PUFAs can improve components of metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS. In this review, we first summarize the available clinical evidence for different dietary patterns in improving PCOS complications. Next, we summarize the clinical evidence for n-3 PUFAs for alleviating metabolic complications in PCOS. Finally, we explore the mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs improve the metabolic disorders in PCOS in depth.",

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 supplementation in the treatment of CKD-aP. MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Scopus databases were searched systematically for articles published from inception until May 21, 2024. Outcomes were pruritus severity at the end of the study or its change from baseline (primary) and intervention-related adverse effects (secondary). Results were pooled as standardized mean difference (SMD) and risk ratio (RR) for numeric and dichotomous outcomes, respectively, along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Eight studies were included. Treatment with omega-3 fatty acids showed a significantly lower severity of CKD-aP at the end of treatment (pooled SMD (95% CI) = -1.03 (-1.85, -0.22), p = 0.024) and changed from baseline (pooled SMD (95% CI) = -0.93 (-1.57, -0.28), p = 0.014). Omega-3 supplementation reduced the risk of CKD-aP (pooled RR (95% CI) = 0.68 (0.12, 3.81), p = 0.661). Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation appears to be a promising effective and safe treatment for CKD-aP. However, the included studies had several limitations that warrant further high-quality studies to elucidate its effect and investigate the causes of non-response in patients who did not improve."

      "abstract": "This study explores the potential of Cucumaria frondosa (C. frondosa) viscera as a natural source of omega-3 FAs using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) extraction. The extraction conditions were optimized using a response surface design, and the optimal parameters were identified as 75 °C and 45 MPa, with a 20 min static and a 30 min dynamic extraction, and a 2:1 ethanol to feedstock mass ratio. Under these conditions, the scCO2 extraction yielded higher FAs than the solvent-based Bligh and Dyer method. The comparative analysis demonstrated that scCO2 extraction (16.30 g of FAs/100 g of dried samples) yielded more fatty acids than the conventional Bligh and Dyer method (9.02 g, or 13.59 g of FAs/100 g of dried samples with ultrasonic assistance), indicating that scCO2 extraction is a viable, green alternative to traditional solvent-based techniques for recovering fatty acids. The pre-treatment effects, including drying methods and ethanol-soaking, were investigated. Freeze-drying significantly enhanced FA yields to almost 100% recovery, while ethanol-soaked viscera tripled the FA yields compared to fresh samples, achieving similar EPA and DHA levels to hot-air-dried samples. These findings highlight the potential of sea cucumber viscera as an efficient source of omega-3 FA extraction and offer an alternative to traditional extraction procedures.",

Unfortunately, TAM has been reported to exert gonadotoxic effects on male testes. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the possible associated mechanisms involved in TAM-induced testicular dysfunction and the possible ameliorative effects of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FA). METHODOLOGY: Animals were randomly divided into control, O3FA, TAM, and TAM + O3FA. All treatment lasted for 28 days. RESULTS: TAM exposure impaired sperm qualities (count, motility, and normal morphology) and decreased testicular 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD. It was accompanied by a decline in serum testosterone and an increase in estradiol, luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones. These observed alterations were associated with an increase in testicular injury markers, oxido-inflammatory response, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These observed alterations were ameliorated by O3FA treatments. CONCLUSIONS: O3FA ameliorated TAM-induced testicular dysfunction in male Wistar rats by modulating XO/UA and Nrf2/NF-kb signaling and cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis in TAM-treated rats."

      "abstract": "The incidence rate of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains high among pregnant women in the second trimester of pregnancy. However, the main clinical approach to alleviate the symptoms of GDM is to control the diet. Our study explored the therapeutic effects of omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) on GDM at the cellular and animal levels. We found that ω-3 FAs can promote the transformation of M0 macrophages into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. The transformed M2 macrophages promoted β-oxidation and reduced hepatocyte lipid synthesis (P < 0.05), thereby promoting hepatic function and preventing the excessive accumulation of lipid droplets in the hepatocyte cell line HepG2. Supplementation of ω-3 FAs in pregnant GDM mice significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and insulin tolerance test indices, and lipid accumulation in the liver and effectively prevented the occurrence of liver fibrosis (P < 0.05). These therapeutic effects may be mediated through the anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 FAs (P < 0.05). ω-3 FAs also had positive effects on the offspring of pregnant GDM mice, as demonstrated by reduced birth mortality and improved glycemic stabilization (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study provides a possible translational medicine strategy for the treatment of GDM."

An essential indicator of inflammation, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), is linked with the acute MI prognosis. We aimed to examine the impact of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as an anti-inflammatory supplement on hs-CRP levels in acute MI patients. Sixty patients with acute MI participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial. For 30 days, patients were randomized to receive omega-3 PUFAs (2 g/day, N = 30) or placebo (N = 30) on top of guideline-directed medical therapy. An initial and endpoint measurement of hs-CRP was performed. We found that the hs-CRP levels in both omega-3 PUFAs and placebo groups remarkably decreased following 30 days of treatment (decreasing from 1.84 (2.3) and 1.3 (2.6) to 0.38 (0.54) and 0.63 (1.12) mg/dL, respectively; P < 0.001). Following the 30 days of treatment, the reducing impact of omega-3 PUFAs (↓ 1.54 (1.98) mg/dL) on hs-CRP was more robust than the placebo group (↓ 0.92 (1.57) mg/dL, P = 0.008). Furthermore, the WBC, cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride levels were markedly decreased in omega-3 and placebo groups after 30 days of therapy (P < 0.001 for all). However, no remarkable differences were reported in the level of these parameters after 30 days of therapy between both studied groups. Our findings showed that omega-3 PUFAs decrease hs-CRP amounts in patients with acute MI. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be an appropriate candidate in patients with early-stage acute MI for inhibiting inflammation.",

This biofilm elicits host response and the interaction between host defence mechanisms with plaque microorganisms and their products results in periodontal disease. Host modulatory therapy (HMT) is a form of treatment of periodontitis that focuses on treatment of the host in the host-bacteria interaction. Omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as a potential HMT agent to treat inflammation associated with periodontal disease. METHODS: A total of 60 cases of chronic periodontitis were allocated into two groups; the test group (n = 30) were treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) and given a dietary supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid while the control group were treated with SRP alone. Clinical parameters carried out were plaque index (PI), gingival bleeding index (GBI), pocket probing depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) and immunological parameter included interleukin-1β level in saliva at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after therapy. RESULTS: At 6 months, both the groups showed significant improvements with regards to all clinical and immunological parameters compared to baseline (all p < 0.05). However, test group presented with more favourable statistically significant results. CONCLUSION: The use of omega-3 fatty acid as nutraceutical agent to conventional method acted as beneficial therapeutic measures and effective in patients with chronic periodontitis when compared with SRP alone."

However, there is a lack of information on the effects of periodontal healing in smokers with periodontitis. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the effect of omega-3 supplementation given as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment on clinical parameters in smoker and non-smoker periodontitis patients. METHODS: This study included a total of 80 periodontitis patients, 40 non-smokers and 40 smokers who were systemically healthy. In this study, patients were divided into 4 groups as follows: Group 1 (Subgingival instrumentation (SI) alone/nonsmoker), Group 2 (SI alone/smoker), Group 3 (SI + Omega-3/nonsmoker) and Group 4 (SI + Omega-3/smoker). Group 3 and 4 consumed 1320 mg Omega-3 capsule (640 mg EPA, 480 mg DHA) once a day for 3 months. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) and bleeding on probing (BOP %) were recorded at baseline, 1 month and 3 months after treatment. RESULTS: Significant improvement of all clinical parameters at 1 and 3 months was observed in all groups. Whole mouth CAL, GI and BOP% were significantly reduced in group 4 compared to group 2 at 1 and 3 months postoperatively (p < 0.05). For moderately deep pockets (4-6 mm) and deep pockets (7 mm≤), PD and CAL reductions were significantly greater in groups taking omega - 3 (group 3 and group 4) compared to groups not taking omega-3 (group 1 and group 2) between baseline and 1 month and between baseline and 3 months (p ˂ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Omega-3 supplementation given as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment provided significant benefit in the improvement of clinical parameters (especially for CAL and PD) in the short term in smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Nonsurgical periodontal treatment with omega-3 supplementation resulted in significant improvements in clinical parameters in smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy may result from the overproduction of ROS, TRPM2 and TRPV2. Moreover, the therapeutic role of ginger, omega-3 fatty acids, and their combinations on the expression of TRPM2 and TRPV2 and their relationship with apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative damage in heart tissue of rats with type 2 diabetes have not yet been determined. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of ginger and omega-3 fatty acids on diabetic cardiomyopathy by evaluating the cardiac gene expression of TRPM2 and TRPV2, oxidative damage, inflammation, and apoptosis in male rats. Ninety adult male Wistar rats were equally divided into nine control, diabetes, and treated diabetes groups. Ginger extract (100 mg/kg) and omega-3 fatty acids (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg) were orally administrated in diabetic rats for 6 weeks. Type 2 diabetes was induced by feeding a high-fat diet and a single dose of STZ (40 mg/kg). Glucose, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), lipid profile, insulin in serum, and TNF-alpha IL-6, SOD, MDA, and CAT in the left ventricle of the heart were measured. The cardiac expression of TRPM2, TRPV2, NF-kappaB, Bcl2, Bax, Cas-3, and Nrf-2 genes was also measured in the left ventricle of the heart. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was continuously recorded to monitor arrhythmia at the end of the course. The serum levels of cTnI, glucose, insulin, and lipid profile, and the cardiac levels of MDA, IL-6, and TNF-alpha increased in the diabetic group compared to the control group (p<0.05). Moreover, the cardiac levels of SOD and CAT decreased in the diabetic group compared to the control group (p<0.05). The cardiac expression of TRPM2, TRPV2, NF-kappaB, Bax, and Cas-3 increased and Bcl2 and Nrf-2 expression decreased in the diabetic group compared to the control group (p<0.05). However, simultaneous and separate treatment with ginger extract and omega-3 fatty acids (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg) could significantly moderate these changes (p<0.05). The results also showed that the simultaneous treatment of ginger extract and different doses of omega-3 fatty acids have improved therapeutic effects than their individual treatments (p<0.05). It can be concluded that ginger and omega-3 fatty acids showed protective effects against diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative damage of the heart and reducing blood glucose and cardiac expression of TRPM2 and TRPV2. Combining ginger and omega-3 in the diet may provide a natural approach to reducing the risk or progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy while preserving heart structure and function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential nutrients known for their anti-inflammatory properties, which involve reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, eicosanoids, and insulin-like growth factor-1. This suggests their potential to alleviate acne severity, especially when deficits are present. AIMS: To elevate EPA/DHA levels in acne patients through dietary intervention and supplementation, observing subsequent clinical effects. METHODS: Over 16 weeks, 60 patients without prescription medication (n = 23 acne comedonica [AC], n = 37 acne papulopustulosa [AP]) adhered to a Mediterranean diet, incorporating oral algae-derived ω-3 FA supplementation (600 mg DHA/300 mg EPA week 1-8, 800 mg DHA/400 mg EPA week 8-16). At four visits (V1-V4), blood EPA/DHA levels were tracked using the HS-omega 3 index® (EPA/DHA (%) of total identified fatty acids in erythrocytes; target 8%-11%, deficit <8%, severe deficit <4%), alongside clinical assessments and standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: At baseline, 98.3% of patients had an EPA/DHA deficit, with the mean HS-omega 3 index® rising from 4.9% at V1 to 8.3% at V4 (p < 0.001). AC showed significantly higher indices than AP at V4 (p = 0.035). Objective improvements in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions were observed (p < 0.001). While self-reported appearance worsened in four patients, overall quality of life improved (p < 0.001), particularly in AP. Dietary triggers were more clearly defined than beneficial foods. Intake of cow's milk and dairy products reduced (p < 0.001). Compliance was good; no adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Many acne patients have a ω-3 FA deficit. The HS-omega 3 index® can be increased by a Mediterranean diet and oral supplementation with algae-derived ω-3 FA. Acne severity improved significantly in patients with target ω-3 FA levels.",

Nanoparticle encapsulation emerges as a promising avenue to address these limitations while preserving stability, enhanced bioavailability, and controlled release. This comprehensive review explores the therapeutic roles of omega-3 fatty acids, critically appraising their shortcomings and delving into modern encapsulation strategies. Furthermore, it explores the potential advantages of metal-organic framework nanoparticles (MOF NPs) compared to other commonly utilized nanoparticles in improving the therapeutic effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids within drug delivery systems (DDSs). Additionally, it outlines future research directions to fully exploit the therapeutic benefits of these encapsulated omega-3 formulations for cardiovascular disease treatment.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Benefits of pharmacologic omega-3 fatty acid administration in cardiovascular prevention are controversial. Particularly, effects on coronary revascularization are unclear; also debated are specific benefits of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). We investigated incident coronary revascularizations, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure (HF), unstable angina, and cardiovascular death, in subjects randomized to receive EPA or EPA + docosahexaenoic acid (EPA + DHA) vs. control. METHODS AND RESULTS: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted after MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library search. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines were followed for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Eighteen RCTs with 134 144 participants (primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention) receiving DHA + EPA (n = 52 498), EPA alone (n = 14 640), or control/placebo (n = 67 006) were included. Follow-up ranged from 4.5 months to 7.4 years. Overall, compared with controls, omega-3 supplementation reduced the risk of revascularization [0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-0.98; P = 0.001; P-heterogeneity = 0.0002; I2 = 68%], MI (0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98; P = 0.02; P-heterogeneity = 0.06; I2 = 41%), and cardiovascular death (0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99; P = 0.02; P-heterogeneity = 0.13; I2 = 33%). Lower risk was still observed in trials where most participants (≥60%) were on statin therapy. Compared with DHA + EPA, EPA alone showed a further significant risk reduction of revascularizations (0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.88; P = 0.0002; P-interaction = 0.005) and all outcomes except HF. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduced the risk of cardiovascular events and coronary revascularization, regardless of background statin use. Eicosapentaenoic acid alone produced greater benefits. The role of specific omega-3 molecules in primary vs. secondary prevention and the potential benefits of reduced revascularizations on overall health status and cost savings warrant further research.",

      "abstract": "Fetal programming research conducted in sheep has reported sexually dimorphic responses on growth of the progeny born to in-utero methionine or omega-3 fatty acids supplementation. However, the biological mechanism behind the nutrient by sex interaction as a source of variation in offspring body weight is still unknown. A high-throughput RNA sequencing data of hypothalamus samples from 17 lambs were used in the current study to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between males and females born to dams supplemented with different nutrients during late-gestation. Ewes received a basal diet without omega-3 fatty acids or methionine supplementation as the control (CONT); omega-3 fatty acids supplementation (FAS), or methionine supplementation (METS). A list of regulated genes was generated. Data were compared as CONT vs. FAS and CONT vs. METS. For CONT vs. METS, a treatment by sex interaction was found (adjusted P-value < 0.05) on 121 DEGs (112 upregulated and 9 downregulated) on female lambs born to METS compared with METS males. Importantly, with the sex interaction term, more than 100 genes were upregulated in female lamb's hypothalamuses born to METS. Gene Ontology (GO) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were performed using the DEGs from female lambs. Terms under biological process (related to morphogenesis, organism, and tissue development), cellular component (related to chromatin, extracellular components), and molecular function (involved in chromatin structure and transcription and factors linked to binding DNA) were presented (adjusted P-value < 0.05) for GO. For the IPA, the top-scoring network was developmental disorder, endocrine system development and function, and organ morphology. Only a few differences were observed in the comparison between the interaction of sex and treatment for the CONT vs. FAS comparison. The markedly increased number of DEGs substantially involved in developmental and growth processes indicates the extent to which maternal methionine supplementation causes the sexually dimorphic effects observed in the offspring.",

This study evaluates the effect of glutamine and omega-3 fatty acids on the growth of intestinal neomucosa on the colonic serosal surface has been evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham, control, glutamine, and omega-3. Laparotomy was performed on all groups. For rats other than the sham group, a 1-cm full-thickness incision was made 4 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, and colonic serosal surface was sutured as a serosal patch over these openings. By using the oral gavage technique, the glutamine group was ingested with 200 mg/kg/day of glutamine, and the omega-3 group was ingested with 100 mg/kg/day of omega-3 fatty acids. At the end of 14 days, the rats were euthanized, blood specimens were collected, and intestinal segments, including serosal patches, were excised. RESULTS: Transforming growth factor-beta was significantly lower in the glutamine group compared to the control group. Similarly, fibroblast growth factor-2 was significantly lower in the glutamine group compared to the sham group. Intestinal neomucosa formation was observed in 100% of rats in the glutamine group. In the control and omega-3 groups, intestinal neomucosa formation was observed in 57.1% and 60% of rats, respectively. The inflammatory response, granulation tissue formation, and fibroblastic activity were more severe in the rats of the glutamine and omega-3 groups. CONCLUSION: The intestinal neomucosa formation is an experimental technique, and both glutamine and omega-3 fatty acids have the potential to positively affect inflammatory response, granulation tissue formation, and fibroblastic activity. Specifically, glutamine has a favorable effect on intestinal neomucosa formation.",

Omega 3 fatty acids (O3FA), on the other hand, are antioxidant and antiapoptotic agents. Therefore, this study explored the role and associated molecular mechanism of O3FA in BPF-induced hypothyroidism-mediated testicular dysfunction in male Wistar rats. METHODS: Twenty (20) male Wistar rats were randomized into four groups (n=5/group), namely: the control group; the BPF treated group (30 mg/kg of BPF); and the intervention groups (30mg/kg BPF + 100mg/kg O3FA (BPF+O3FA-L) and 30mg/kg BPF + 300mg/kg of O3FA for 28 days). RESULTS: Low and high doses of O3FA ameliorated BPF-induced hypothyroidism-mediated reduction in sperm quality, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, catalase, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and increases in estrogen, malondialdehyde, c-reactive protein, interleukin 1 beta, caspase 3. Furthermore, O3FA prevented BPF-induced Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase dysfunction, estrogen receptor beta overexpression, and tumor protein P53 (p53)/ b-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) imbalance. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that O3FA ameliorated BPF-induced dysthyroidism-mediated testicular dysfunction by preventing proton pump dysfunction and p53/BCl-2 imbalance.",

The pharmacokinetics (PKs), such as the area under the plot of plasma concentration (AUC), and the peak blood concentration (Cmax) of the different FA metabolites including HDHAs, HETEs, HEPEs, RvD1, RvD5, RvE1, and RvE2, were determined over a total period of 24 h. Blood concentrations of EPA (26,920.0 ± 10,021.0 ng/mL·h) were significantly higher with respect to AUC0-24 following LMF treatment vs STD and ENT; when measured incrementally, blood concentrations of total n-3 FAs (EPA/DHA/DPA3) up to 11 times higher were observed for LMF vs STD (iAUC 0-24: 16,150.0 ± 5454.0 vs 1498.9 ± 443.0; p ≤ 0.0001). Significant differences in n-3 metabolites including oxylipins were found between STD and LMF with respect to 12-HEPE, 9-HEPE, 12-HETE, and RvD1; 9-HEPE levels were significantly higher following the STD vs. ENT treatment. Furthermore, within the scope of this study, changes in blood lipid levels (i.e., cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL) were monitored in participants for up to 120 h post-treatment; a significant decrease in serum triglycerides was detected in participants (~20%) following the LMF treatment; no significant deviations from the baseline were detected for all the other lipid biomarkers in any of the treatment groups. Despite a lower administered dose, LMF provided higher blood concentrations of n-3 FAs and certain anti-inflammatory n-3 metabolites in human participants-potentially leading to better health outcomes."

T. chuii biomass was confirmed to be an important source of omega-3 FA, mainly due to the abundance of α-linolenic acid, and pre-treatment significantly improved the lipid yield. Other omega-3 FA, such as 16:3, 16:4, 18:4, 18:5, 20:3 and 20:5, were also detected in different proportions. When SCCO2 extraction of pretreated and un-pretreated T. chuii was compared with conventional solvent extraction, the nutritional quality indices of the extracts were improved by the use of SCCO2.",

Therefore, omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) have been suggested as a beneficial complementary treatment due to their ability to regulate inflammatory responses and improve nutrition levels.This study aimed to evaluate the effects of O3FAs as a complementary treatment for inflammation, nutrition levels, post-operative infectious complications, and enhancement of recovery in CRC patients. METHODS: The literature search was carried out through three databases. The outcomes of interest were assessed by measuring pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and CRP levels, serum albumin levels for nutrition assessment, post-operative infectious complications, and length of stay for recovery evaluation. Quality appraisal and meta-analysis were performed using RoB 2.0 and RevMan 5.4, respectively. RESULTS: The result showed that O3FAs significantly reduced IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α, but did not affect IL-1β. Furthermore, the variable slightly increased serum albumin levels and the supplementation led to a decrease in post-operative infectious complications and shortened hospital stays. CONCLUSION: O3FAs as a complementary treatment provided advantages for CRC patients, Further clinical trials and experiments should also be made emphasizing the impact and clinical implementation of O3FA in the nutritional status of CRC patients.",

      "abstract": "Migraine is a highly prevalent disease worldwide, imposing enormous clinical and economic burdens on individuals and societies. Current treatments exhibit limited efficacy and acceptability, highlighting the need for more effective and safety prophylactic approaches, including the use of nutraceuticals for migraine treatment. Migraine involves interactions within the central and peripheral nervous systems, with significant activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular system (TVS) in pain generation and transmission. The condition is influenced by genetic predispositions and environmental factors, leading to altered sensory processing. The neuroinflammatory response is increasingly recognized as a key event underpinning the pathophysiology of migraine, involving a complex neuro-glio-vascular interplay. This interplay is partially mediated by neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene receptor peptide (CGRP), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and/or cortical spreading depression (CSD) and involves oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome formation, activated microglia, and reactive astrocytes. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), crucial for the nervous system, mediate various physiological functions. Omega-3 PUFAs offer cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric benefits due to their potent anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, antioxidant, and neuromodulatory properties, which modulate neuroinflammation, neurogenic inflammation, pain transmission, enhance mitochondrial stability, and mood regulation. Moreover, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), a class of PUFA-derived lipid mediators, regulate pro-inflammatory and resolution pathways, playing significant anti-inflammatory and neurological roles, which in turn may be beneficial in alleviating the symptomatology of migraine. Omega-3 PUFAs impact various neurobiological pathways and have demonstrated a lack of major adverse events, underscoring their multifaceted approach and safety in migraine management. Although not all omega-3 PUFAs trials have shown beneficial in reducing the symptomatology of migraine, further research is needed to fully establish their clinical efficacy and understand the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of omega-3 PUFAs and PUFA-derived lipid mediators, SPMs on migraine pathophysiology and progression. This review highlights their potential in modulating brain functions, such as neuroimmunological effects, and suggests their promise as candidates for effective migraine prophylaxis."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to comprehensively review animal and human studies that explore the role of omega-3 PUFAs in maintaining the health of the auditory organ across all life stages. METHODS: This narrative review involved searching Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant articles from December 1980 to July 2023. RESULTS: some animal and human studies suggest that both deficiency and excessive intake of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), can lead to auditory neural conduction impairment and reduced hearing acuity from fetal development to old age (presbycusis). These effects are likely to be dependent on the dosage. Some research indicates that an excessive intake of omega-3, rather than a deficiency, can result in nutritional toxicity and hearing impairments. Animal studies highlight the positive impact of omega-3 supplements with high DHA content in addressing hearing damage, but human research on this subject is limited. Furthermore, certain studies propose that omega-3 PUFAs may prevent or delay age-related hearing loss, with high plasma omega-3 concentration, particularly long-chain omega-3 PUFA, linked to reduced hearing loss. Additionally, consuming fish more than twice a week may be associated with a lower risk of hearing loss in adulthood, with these effects potentially influenced by age and gender. However, the majority of studies have been conducted on animals, and clinical trials are scarce. Research on the influence of omega-3 PUFAs on the peripheral and central vestibular systems remains limited. CONCLUSION: This article delves into the impact of omega-3 on the auditory-vestibular system, exploring its influence on neurodevelopment, protection, and treatment. It not only highlights specific research gaps but also offers valuable insights for potential future studies.",

Therefore, they may improve acne severity as an adjunct treatment. However, there is a paucity of data regarding patients' existing deficits. The aim of this study was to determine ω-3 FA levels in acne patients in correlation with self-reported dietary preferences and clinical severity. A single-center, cross-sectional study of 100 acne patients was conducted. Patients' blood parameters, including ω-3 FAs levels, were assessed using the HS-omega-3 Index® in erythrocytes (Omegametrix® GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). Dietary preferences were assessed using a standardized food frequency questionnaire. Clinical dermatologic evaluation was performed using the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of acne. The values of the HS-omega-3 Index® were outside the recommended range of 8-11% in 96 patients (mean 5.15%), independent of the clinical severity or affected anatomic sites. A severe deficit (HS-omega-3 Index® < 4%) was seen more commonly in men than in women (p = 0.021). The regular consumption of legumes was significantly associated with higher ω-3 FA levels (p = 0.003), as was oral ω-3 FA supplementation (p = 0.006) and the lack of sunflower oil intake (p = 0.008). This pilot study demonstrated a deficit of ω-3 FAs in a German acne cohort. Higher ω-3 FAs levels were observed in patients with regular legume intake and oral ω-3 FAs supplementation. Further prospective studies are needed to investigate whether the clinical severity of acne improves in patients with normal HS-omega-3 Index®."

Within WFPB diets, the intakes of isoflavones, omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs), and omega-3 polyunsaturated FAs (n-3 PUFAs), which have been discussed in reference to breast cancer outcomes, have not been well characterized. METHODS: Women with stage IV breast cancer on stable therapy were randomized 2:1 into (1) a WFPB intervention (N = 21) or (2) usual care (N = 11) for 8 weeks. Three meals per day were provided. Outcomes presented here include dietary intake of isoflavones, n-3 and n-6- PUFAs, which were assessed using three-day food records at baseline and 8 weeks. Baseline and 8-week mean intake within groups were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and between control and intervention groups by a two-sample t-test. RESULTS: The WFPB intervention participants increased their daily consumption of total isoflavones from a mean of 0.8 mg/day to 14.5 mg/day (p < 0.0001) and decreased the n-6:n-3 ratio of their diet from a mean of 9.3 to 3.7 (p < 0.0001). Within the WFPB group, linoleic acid (n-6 PUFA) consumption decreased by a mean of 3.8 g (p = 0.0095), from 12.8 g/day to 9.0 g/day; total n-3 PUFA consumption increased by a mean of 1.1 g (p = 0.0005), from 1.6 g/day to 2.7 g/day. CONCLUSION: Transitioning to a WFPB diet resulted in significantly increased isoflavone intake and decreased n-6:n-3 ratio in women with breast cancer."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation interventions in improving depression in patients with dementia. To achieve this objective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from primary electronic databases, focusing on the relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and depression in patients with dementia. The primary outcome was the impact of omega-3 fatty acids on post-intervention depression in patients with dementia, with subgroup analyses conducted based on the type of intervention (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) combination), duration of intervention (3 months, 6 months, 12 months, ≥24 months), cognitive function (ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to severe dementia), and daily dosage (high, medium, low, applicable to both DHA and EPA). The study has been duly registered with PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42023408744). A meta-analysis of five studies (n = 517) included in nine systematic reviews showed that omega-3 supplementation had a non-significant trend toward affecting depressive symptoms in patients with dementia (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.147; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.324 to 0.049; p = 0.141). Subgroup analyses revealed that DHA supplementation significantly reduced depressive symptoms (SMD: -0.247; p = 0.039). There was no significant effect for high (SMD: -0.169; 95% CI: -0.454 to 0.116; p = 0.246) or medium (SMD: -0.061; 95% CI: -0.228 to 0.105; p = 0.470) doses of EPA. However, low doses of EPA were significantly effective (SMD: -0.953; 95% CI: -1.534 to -0.373; p = 0.001), with notable improvements in patients with MCI (SMD: -0.934; p < 0.001). The study concludes that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly through DHA supplementation, may alleviate depressive symptoms in patients with MCI. Given the limited sample size, further long-term RCTs are recommended to better understand the efficacy and optimal management of omega-3 supplementation in this population using different dosages."

Three omega-3 fatty acid supplement capsules (3 g/d) were administered daily for two months to patients in the intervention group (n = 55). The control group (n = 60) were given three placebo capsules containing medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, similar to the supplemental dose of the intervention group at the same period. Three parameters of HCT, HB and PLT were measured at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: The PLT count decreased in the intervention group compared to the control group (173.38 ± 74.76 vs. 227.68 ± 86.58 103/mm3, F = 4.83, P = 0.03). No significant change was found on the levels of HCT and HB parameters between the two groups after the intervention.

The aim of this post-hoc analysis was to compare the effect of hypolipidemic treatment on Lp(a) levels of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We previously randomized patients with mixed hyperlipidemia (low-density lipoprotein [LDL-C] > 160 mg/dl and triglycerides > 200 mg/dl) to rosuvastatin monotherapy 40 mg/day (R group, n = 30) or rosuvastatin 10 mg/day combined with fenofibrate 200 mg/day (RF group, n = 30) or omega-3 fatty acids 2 g/day (RΩ group, n = 30). In the present post-hoc analysis, we included only the patients whose Lp(a) levels were assessed (16, 16 and 15 in the R, RF and RΩ groups, respectively). Lipid profile and Lp(a) were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. RESULTS: Significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and triglyceride levels were observed in all groups. A significant increase in Lp(a) levels was noted in the R (p = 0.017) and RF (p = 0.029) groups, while no significant difference was seen in the RΩ group (p = NS). Regarding Lp(a) elevations, no differences were found between groups. In the R group, a strong negative correlation between the changes in Lp(a) and LDL-C (r = -0.500, p = 0.049) was observed, while a significant negative correlation between the changes in Lp(a) and triglycerides (r = -0.531, p = 0.034) was noted in the RF group. CONCLUSIONS: Rosuvastatin and/or fenofibrate treatment increases Lp(a) levels in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. Novel therapies should target Lp(a) level reduction to decrease the residual ASCVD risk in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "Despite decades of research on the pathophysiology of depression, the development of new therapeutic interventions has been slow, and no biomarkers of treatment response have been clinically implemented. Several lines of evidence suggest that the clinical and biological heterogeneity among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) has hampered progress in this field. MDD with low-grade inflammation - \"inflamed depression\" - is a subtype of depression that may be associated with a superior antidepressant treatment response to anti-inflammatory compounds. Omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has anti-inflammatory properties, and preliminary data suggest that it may be particularly efficacious in inflamed depression. In this study we tested the hypothesis that add-on EPA has greater antidepressant efficacy in MDD patients with high baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) compared to MDD patients with low hs-CRP. All subjects received 2.2 g EPA, 400 mg docosahexaenoic acid and 800 mg of other fatty acids daily for 8 weeks, added to stable ongoing antidepressant treatment. The primary outcome was change in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17). Patients and raters were blind to baseline hs-CRP status. In an intention-to-treat analysis including all subjects with at least one post baseline visit (n = 101), ahs-CRPcut-off of ≥1 mg/L, but not ≥3 mg/L, was associated with a greater improvement in HAMD-17 total score. In addition to a general antidepressant effect among patients with hs-CRP ≥ 1 mg/L, adjuvant EPA treatment improved symptoms putatively related to inflamed depression such as fatigue and sleep difficulties. This adds to the mounting evidence that delineation of MDD subgroups based on inflammation may be clinically relevant to predict treatment response to anti-inflammatory interventions.",

HAE was assessed at the beginning and end of the study. Compared to placebo, ERN and P-OM3 alone significantly increased HAE by 15.1% [8.2, 22.0] (P<0.0001) and 11.1% [4.5, 17.7] (P<0.0005), respectively, while in combination they increased HAE by 10.0% [2.5, 15.8] (P = 0.005). When HAE was evaluated per unit mass of apoA-I ERN increased apoA-I specific exchange activity by 20% (2, 41 CI, P = 0.02) and P-OM3 by 28% (9.6, 48 CI, P<0.0006). However the combination had no statistically significant effect, 10% (-9, 31 CI, P = 0.39). With regard to P-OM3 therapy in particular, the HAE assay detected an increase in this property in the absence of a concomitant rise in HDL-C and apoA-I levels, suggesting that the assay can detect functional changes in HDL that occur in the absence of traditional biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "Three experiments evaluated omega-3 fatty acids, provided by O3 trial feed, on nursery pig growth performance, mortality, and response to an LPS immune challenge or natural Porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) outbreak. In experiment 1, 350 pigs (241 × 600, DNA; initially 5.8 kg) were used. Pens of pigs were randomly assigned to one of the five dietary treatments containing increasing omega-3 fatty acids (0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% O3 trial feed) with 14 replications per treatment. On day 25, two pigs per pen were injected intramuscularly with 20 μg Escherichia coli LPS per kg BW and one pig per pen was injected with saline as a control. Body temperature was taken from all three pigs prior to and 2, 4, 6, and 12 h post-LPS challenge. Serum IL-1β and TNF-α concentrations were determined in LPS-challenged pigs 24 h prior and 4 h post-LPS challenge. There was no interaction between treatment and time for change in body temperature (P > 0.10). Overall, increasing the O3 trial feed did not affect (P > 0.10) ADG, ADFI, G:F, IL-1β, or TNF-α. In experiment 2, 1,056 pigs (PIC TR4 × [Fast LW × PIC L02] initially 7.3 kg) were used. Pens of pigs were randomly assigned to one of the four dietary treatments containing increasing omega-3 fatty acids (0%, 0.75%, 1.5%, and 3% O3 trial feed) with 12 replications per treatment. Oral fluids tested negative on days 7 and 14, but then positive for North American PRRSV virus via PCR on days 21, 28, 35, and 42. Overall, increasing O3 trial feed increased (linear, P < 0.001) ADG, ADFI, and G:F and decreased (linear, P = 0.027) total removals and mortality. In experiment 3, 91,140 pigs (DNA 600 × PIC 1050; initially 5.1 kg), originating from PRRSV-positive sow farms, were used across eight nursery sites. Each site contained five barns with two rooms per barn and ~1,100 pigs per room. Rooms of pigs were blocked by nursery site and allocated within sow source to one of the two dietary treatments (control or 3% O3 trial feed) with 40 replications per treatment. Oral fluids from 61 of the 80 rooms tested positive for North American PRRSV virus 1 wk postweaning and 78 of the 80 rooms tested positive 3 wk after weaning. Overall, O3 trial feed did not affect ADG, ADFI, or G:F but increased (P < 0.001) total removals and mortalities. In summary, increasing omega-3 fatty acids, sourced by O3 trial feed, did not improve growth performance or immune response in healthy pigs given an LPS challenge. However, it appears that if omega-3 fatty acids are fed prior to a natural PRRSV break (as in experiment 2), growth performance may be improved, and mortality reduced."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with hyperlipidemia treated with statins remain at a residual cardiovascular (CV) risk. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids hold the potential to mitigate the residual CV risk in statin-treated patients, with persistently elevated triglyceride (TG) levels. METHOD: We reviewed the current evidence on the use of icosapent ethyl (IPE), an omega-3 fatty acid yielding a pure form of eicosapentaenoic acid. RESULTS: REDUCE-IT reported a significant 25% reduction in CV events, including the need for coronary revascularization, the risk of fatal/nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, and CV death in patients on IPE, unseen with other omega-3 fatty acids treatments. IPE was effective in all patients regardless of baseline CV risk enhancers (TG levels, type-2 diabetes status, weight status, prior revascularization, or renal function). Adverse events (atrial fibrillation/flutter) related to IPE have occurred mostly in patients with prior atrial fibrillation. Yet, the net clinical benefit largely exceeded potential risks. The combination with other omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular DHA, eliminated the effect of EPA alone, as reported in the STRENGTH and OMEMI trials. Adding IPE to statin treatment seems to be cost-effective, especially in the context of secondary prevention of CVD, decreasing CV event frequency and subsequently the use of healthcare resources. CONCLUSION: Importantly, IPE has been endorsed by 20 international medical societies as a statin add-on treatment in patients with dyslipidemia and high CV risk. Robust medical evidence supports IPE as a pillar in the management of dyslipidemia."

However, how omega-3 fatty acids act on β cells is not well understood. We have shown that omega-3 fatty acids reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated β-cell apoptosis by upregulating the expression of the ADP-ribosylhydrolase ARH3. Here, we further investigate the β-cell protection mechanism by ARH3 by performing siRNA of its gene Adprhl2 in MIN6 insulin-producing cells followed by treatment with a cocktail of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β + IFN-γ + TNF-α, and proteomics analysis. ARH3 regulated proteins from several pathways related to the nucleus (splicing, RNA surveillance and nucleocytoplasmic transport), mitochondria (metabolic pathways) and endoplasmic reticulum (protein folding). ARH3 also regulated the levels of cytokine-signaling proteins related to the antigen processing and presentation, and chemokine-signaling pathway. We further studied the role of ARH in regulating the chemokine CXCL9. We confirmed that ARH3 reduces the cytokine-induced expression of CXCL9 by ELISA. We also found that CXCL9 expression is regulated by omega-3 fatty acids. In conclusion, we showed that omega-3 fatty acids regulate CXCL9 expression via ARH3, which might have a role in protecting β cells from immune attack and preventing T1D development."

      "abstract": "This study provides the fatty acid profile, presence of Omega 3 fatty acids (ω3FAs) and therapeutic potential of the skin of Garfish (Belone belone), a highly nutritious fish. The ω3FAs were obtained using the urea crystallization method and confirmed by UV VIS spectroscopy, HPLC, FT-IR, and NMR. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of the ω3FAs was assessed through antioxidant, antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and toxicity assays. The oil extracted from Garfish skin (GS) predominantly contains ω3FAs, palmitic acids, and oleic acids. The ω3FAs exhibit high anti-free radical activity and ferric reducing activity. It reduces nitric oxide production as well as lipid peroxidation under certain time. They also demonstrate effective antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The biofilm formation is efficiently reduced by ω3FAs and eradication effects on biofilm are higher at 4000 µg/mL of concentration. When tested against brine shrimp larvae, ω3FAs were found to be non-toxic. The study indicates that GS skin oil contains a significant amount of omega-3 fatty acids and has potential therapeutic benefits due to its antioxidant and antibacterial properties, without causing any toxic effects. Omega-3 fatty acids have the potential to enhance the treatment of infections caused by harmful bacteria and their biofilm formation. Further research is needed to understand how omega-3 fatty acids work to kill bacteria and how they affect bacterial gene expression."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Omega-3 fatty acids have potent lipid-lowering and antiplatelet effects; however, randomized controlled trials have yet to examine the effect of high-dose omega-3 fatty acid administration on peripheral artery disease (PAD) in hemodialysis patients with dyslipidemia. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and remnant-like lipoprotein cholesterol (RLP-C) levels, which are indicators of PAD severity. Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight participants (mean age: 73.6 ± 12.7 years) were randomly assigned using stratified block randomization to either conventional therapy alone or conventional therapy supplemented with high-dose EPA/DHA (EPA: 1860 mg; DHA: 1500 mg) for a three-month intervention period. Patients in the conventional therapy alone group who opted to continue were provided with a low-dose EPA/DHA regimen (EPA: 930 mg; DHA: 750 mg) for an additional three months. The baseline and 3-month values for RLP-C, an atherogenic lipid parameter, and the ABI were recorded. Results: The results of the 3-month assessments revealed that the mean RLP-C changes were -3.25 ± 3.15 mg/dL and 0.44 ± 2.53 mg/dL in the EPA/DHA and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001), whereas the changes in the mean ABI values were 0.07 ± 0.11 and -0.02 ± 0.09 in the EPA/DHA and control groups, respectively (p = 0.007). In the EPA/DHA group, a significant negative correlation was found between the changes in RLP-C levels and the ABI (r = -0.475, p = 0.04). Additionally, the change in the RLP-C levels independently influenced the change in the ABI in the EPA/DHA group, even after adjusting for age, sex, and statin use (p = 0.042). Conclusions: Add-on EPA/DHA treatment improved the effectiveness of conventional therapy (such as statin treatment) for improving the ABI in hemodialysis patients with dyslipidemia by lowering RLP-C levels. Therefore, clinicians involved in dialysis should focus on RLP-C when considering residual cardiovascular disease risk in hemodialysis patients and should consider screening patients with elevated levels.",

      "abstract": "Omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) possess beneficial properties for cardiovascular (CV) health and elevated O3FA levels are associated with lower incident risk for CV disease (CVD.) Yet, treatment of at-risk patients with various O3FA formulations has produced disparate results in large, well-controlled and well-conducted clinical trials. Prescription formulations and fish oil supplements containing low-dose mixtures of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have routinely failed to prevent CV events in primary and secondary prevention settings when added to contemporary care, as shown most recently in the STRENGTH and OMEMI trials. However, as observed in JELIS, REDUCE-IT, and RESPECT-EPA, EPA-only formulations significantly reduce CVD events in high-risk patients. The CV mechanism of action of EPA, while certainly multifaceted, does not depend solely on reductions of circulating lipids, including triglycerides (TG) and LDL, and event reduction appears related to achieved EPA levels suggesting that the particular chemical and biological properties of EPA, as compared to DHA and other O3FAs, may contribute to its distinct clinical efficacy. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown different effects of EPA compared with DHA alone or EPA/DHA combination treatments, on atherosclerotic plaque morphology, LDL and membrane oxidation, cholesterol distribution, membrane lipid dynamics, glucose homeostasis, endothelial function, and downstream lipid metabolite function. These findings indicate that prescription-grade, EPA-only formulations provide greater benefit than other O3FAs formulations tested. This review summarizes the clinical findings associated with various O3FA formulations, their efficacy in treating CV disease, and their underlying mechanisms of action.",

      "abstract": "Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) is currently the main stay in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) disease. This treatment regimen typically combines three or more antiretroviral drugs and like most drug combinations or polypharmacy, has side effects including those on reproductive function which could place HIV patients on HAART under double risk in terms of reproductive function. Part of tissue damage following HAART administration is blamed on oxidative stress. We therefore sought to explore effects of Omega 3 and Selenium, two common antioxidants on HAART-induced male reproductive impairment in a non-HIV animal model. Sixteen male adult Wistar rats weighing 120g to 250g used for the study were grouped into 4 groups of four rats each (control, HAART-only, HAART + Omega 3 and HAART + Selenium groups). Duration of daily administration was six weeks. Results showed no significant changes in pH of epidydimal semen among the groups. Sperm count and viability were significantly reduced in HAART-only compared with control (p<0.05) but increased in HAART + Omega 3 and HAART + Selenium groups compared with HAART-only group (p< 0.05). Sperm motility was significantly reduced in HAART-only compared with control group (p< 0.05). A significantly higher percentage of total sperm defects was observed in HAART-only group compared with control (p <0.05) but significantly lower in the HAART + Selenium compared with HAART-only groups (p<0.05). Serum testosterone was significantly reduced in HAART-only compared with control groups (p<0.05) but significantly increased in HAART + Omega 3 and HAART + Selenium groups compared with HAART- only group (p<0.05). Serum concentration of luteinizing and follicle stimulating hormones were not significantly different among the groups. Testicular concentration of malondialdehyde was significantly increased in HAART-only compared with control (p<0.05) but significantly reduced in HAART + Omega 3 and HAART + Selenium groups compared with HAART-only group (p<0.05 in each). Testicular glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly reduced in HAART-only and HAART + Selenium groups compared with control (p< 0.05), but significantly higher in HAART + Omega 3 and HAART + Selenium compared with HAART-only groups (p<0.05 each). Testicular superoxide dismutase activity was significantly lower in the HAART-only and HAART + Selenium compared with control (p<0.05) but significantly higher in HAART + Omega 3 and HAART + Selenium compared with HAART-only groups (p<0.05 each). Level of tumour necrosis factor - alpha in testes was significantly higher in HAART-only (p<0.05) but lower in the HAART + Selenium (p<0.05) groups compared with control. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was however significantly reduced in HAART + Omega 3 and HAART + Selenium groups compared with HAART-only (p<0.05 each) groups. Interleukin-6 levels were significantly increased in all HAART-administered groups compared with control (p<0.05 each) though significantly reduced in HAART + Omega 3 and HAART + Selenium compared with HAART-only groups (p<0.05 each). In conclusion, co-administration of Omega 3 or Selenium with HAART ameliorates HAART-induced male reproductive impairment, alteration in redox and inflammatory status in rats.

Analyses of these scores as standardized categorical variables using a previously validated strategy may yield different results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ORIGIN trial recruited participants with dysglycaemia and additional cardiovascular risk factors from 573 sites in 40 countries. They completed a mini mental state examination and a subset completed the digit symbol substitution test at baseline and up to three subsequent visits. The effect of the interventions on country-standardized substantive cognitive impairment, defined as the first occurrence of a baseline-adjusted follow-up mini mental state examination or digit symbol substitution test score ≥1.5 standard deviations below the baseline mean score in each participant's country was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 2627 of 11 682 people (22.5%) developed country-standardized substantive cognitive impairment. The hazard of this outcome was reduced by 9% (hazard ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.85, 0.99; p = .023) in participants assigned to insulin glargine (21.6%) versus standard care (23.3%). Conversely, the hazard of this outcome was not affected by assignment to omega 3 fatty acid versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.86, 1.01; p = .074). CONCLUSIONS: In this post hoc exploratory analysis, insulin glargine-mediated normoglycaemia but not omega 3 fatty acids reduced the hazard of substantive cognitive impairment in people with dysglycaemia and additional cardiovascular risk factors.",

DATA SYNTHESIS: Five electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of ɷ-3 FAs on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD. The language was restricted to English. The risk ratio was pooled. Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate whether study-level variables might act as effect modifiers. A total of 12 studies involving 29913 patients were included. ɷ-3 FAs had no effects on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) (RR, 0.93; 95 % CI: 0.85 to 1.01, P = 0.09). While ɷ-3 FAs reduced the incidences of all-cause death (RR, 0.90; 95 % CI: 0.83 to 0.97, P = 0.005), cardiovascular death (RR, 0.82; 95 % CI: 0.75 to 0.90, P < 0.0001), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.77; 95 % CI: 0.68 to 0.86, P < 0.0001), revascularization (RR, 0.80; 95 % CI: 0.69 to 0.93, P = 0.003), sudden cardiac death (RR, 0.67; 95 % CI: 0.52 to 0.86, P = 0.002) and hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina pectoris (RR, 0.75; 95 % CI: 0.58 to 0.97, P = 0.03) in CAD. It did not statistically reduce the risk of stroke (RR, 0.96; 95 % CI: 0.77 to 1.21, P = 0.76). The favorable effects of ɷ-3 FAs on MACEs were significant in subgroups of intervention with EPA and baseline triglyceride ≥1.7 mmol/L. CONCLUSION: ɷ-3 FAs supplementation, especially EPA, appears to be an effective adjunct therapy for improving the prognosis of CAD. REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42022311237.",

      "abstract": "Migraine is a highly prevalent neurologic disorder with prevalence rates ranging from 9% to 18% worldwide. Current pharmacologic prophylactic strategies for migraine have limited efficacy and acceptability, with relatively low response rates of 40% to 50% and limited safety profiles. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are considered promising therapeutic agents for migraine prophylaxis. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare the efficacy and acceptability of various dosages of EPA/DHA and other current Food and Drug Administration-approved or guideline-recommended prophylactic pharmacologic interventions for migraine. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion if they enrolled participants with a diagnosis of either episodic or chronic migraine. All NMA procedures were conducted under the frequentist model. The primary outcomes assessed were 1) changes in migraine frequency and 2) acceptability (i.e., dropout for any reason). Secondary outcomes included response rates, changes in migraine severity, changes in the frequency of using rescue medications, and frequency of any adverse events. Forty RCTs were included (N = 6616; mean age = 35.0 y; 78.9% women). Our analysis showed that supplementation with high dosage EPA/DHA yields the highest decrease in migraine frequency [standardized mean difference (SMD): -1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.32, -0.39 compared with placebo] and the largest decrease in migraine severity (SMD: -2.23; 95% CI: -3.17, -1.30 compared with placebo) in all studied interventions. Furthermore, supplementation with high dosage EPA/DHA showed the most favorable acceptability rates (odds ratio: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.06, 17.41 compared with placebo) of all examined prophylactic treatments. This study provides compelling evidence that high dosage EPA/DHA supplementation can be considered a first-choice treatment of migraine prophylaxis because this treatment displayed the highest efficacy and highest acceptability of all studied treatments. This study was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022319577.",

Recently two large, randomised trials were published with discordant findings regarding the overall benefits of omega-3 supplementation, resulting in unnecessary confusion and therapeutic nihilism. Epidemiological studies clearly show high intake of fish and measured O3FA (mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) in tissues are inversely associated with cardiovascular events and total mortality. These fatty acids are 'essential' and depend almost entirely on intake with very little production from within the body. The efficacy of supplementation depends on background tissue levels, in contradistinction to drug therapy. Insufficient dosing of omega-3 supplementation using less than 1 g/day and lack of titration to target by failing to measure O3FA levels in the blood may explain these conflicting trial outcomes. We review the current evidence regarding O3FA supplementation and cardiovascular outcomes, describe possible reasons for the discrepant results in the literature including recent controversial data around the mineral oil comparator used in REDUCE-IT and discuss the potential use of the omega-3 index to guide management and optimise supplementation in those at greatest risk.",

      "abstract": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), such as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are reported to beneficially affect the intestinal immunity. The biological pathways modulated by n-3 PUFA during an infection, at the level of intestinal epithelial barrier remain elusive. To address this gap, we investigated the proteomic changes induced by n-3 PUFA in porcine enterocyte cell line (IPEC-J2), in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stress conditions using shotgun proteomics analysis integrated with RNA-sequencing technology. A total of 33, 85, and 88 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified in cells exposed to n-3 PUFA (DHA:EPA), LPS, and n-3 PUFA treatment followed by LPS stimulation, respectively. Functional annotation and pathway analysis of DAPs revealed the modulation of central carbon metabolism, including the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, and oxidative phosphorylation processes. Specifically, LPS caused metabolic dysregulation in enterocytes, which was abated upon prior treatment with n-3 PUFA. Besides, n-3 PUFA supplementation facilitated enterocyte development and lipid homeostasis. Altogether, this work for the first time comprehensively described the biological pathways regulated by n-3 PUFA in enterocytes, particularly during endotoxin-stimulated metabolic dysregulation. Additionally, this study may provide nutritional biomarkers in monitoring the intestinal health of human and animals on n-3 PUFA-based diets.",

However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the concomitant use of omega-3 fatty acids in addition to statins. This meta-analysis aims to uncover the complete effects of this combination therapy on cardiovascular outcomes, lipid biomarkers, inflammatory markers, and plaque markers. METHODS: A detailed literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane, and MEDLINE databases, and all the relevant studies found up to September 2023 were included. The primary outcomes assessed in this meta-analysis was 1) Composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, 2) Composite of fatal and non-fatal stroke, 3) Coronary revascularization, 4) Death due to cardiovascular causes, 5) MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events), 6) Unstable angina, 7) Hospitalization due to unstable angina, 8) and lipid volume index. Secondary outcomes included lipid markers, hsCRP, EPA levels, and EPA/AA ratio. RESULTS: 14 RCTs were included, featuring a total of 40,991 patients. Patients receiving the omega-3 + statin regimen were associated with a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of MI, MACE, unstable angina, hospitalization due to unstable angina, Total cholesterol levels, triglycerides, hsCRP, and lipid volume index in comparison to their counterparts receiving placebo + statin (P < 0.05). In contrast, our analysis found no statistically significant difference in the incidence of fatal and non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSION: Our research reinforces that all patients, regardless of their cardiovascular health, may benefit from adding omega-3 fatty acids to their statin therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is caused by insulin resistance or tissue insensitivity to insulin, as well as relative insulin insufficiency. Diabetes that is uncontrolled for an extended period of time is linked to substantial comorbidities and organ damage. The purpose of the current study is to assess the effect of coadministration of omega-3 fatty acids with glimepiride on blood glucose, lipid profile, serum irisin, and sirtuin-1 levels in T2DM patients. METHODS: This clinical trial involved 70 type 2 diabetic patients randomly assigned to glimepiride 3 mg with either omega-3 capsules contained fish oil 1000 mg, 13% of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 9% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (omega-3 group, n = 35) or placebo capsules contained corn oil and linoleic acid (control group, n = 35) daily for three months. Blood samples were obtained at the start of the study and 12 weeks later for biochemical examination of HbA1c%, FBG, fasting insulin, and lipid profile. In addition, the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) was calculated. Human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were utilized for assessing serum irisin and sirtuin-1 levels before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, omega-3 fatty acids decreased serum fasting blood glucose (FBG, p < 0.001), glycated hemoglobin percent (HbA1C%, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC, p < 0.001), triglycerides (TGs, p = 0.006), low density lipoprotein (LDL, p = 0.089), and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR, p = 0.021) after three months of intervention. However, a significant increase was reported in serum irisin and high density lipoprotein (HDL) between both groups after intervention (p = 0.026 and p = 0.007, respectively). The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) increased in the control group but decreased in the omega-3 group, with significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study found that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids might dramatically enhance blood irisin levels, as well as improve glycemic control and lipid profile in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients using glimepiride.

Despite interest in dietary strategies to improve management of oncology patients, there have been very few clinical studies showing the impact of diet on adverse effects of chemotherapy in dogs. This study was a randomised, controlled, double-blinded, multicenter clinical trial to investigate a high-protein, increased-fibre diet supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids, for dogs with cancer undergoing standard-of-care chemotherapy. Client-owned dogs with newly diagnosed grade 2 or higher mast cell tumours (or non-resectable/incompletely resected tumours) or multicentric lymphoma were randomised to receive the test diet (n = 24) or control diet (n = 21) for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were QOL assessments, faecal scores, and blood concentrations of C-reactive protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Of 12 QOL parameters, 10 significantly improved from baseline to Week 8 in the test group compared with one in the control group. However, differences between the two groups were only statistically significant for 'frequency of signs of illness' (P = .009). There were no significant differences in the incidence of any adverse events, including gastrointestinal adverse events or clinically significant differences in laboratory parameters or faecal scores between the two groups. The absence of an observed negative impact of the test diet, combined with the magnitude of QOL improvements associated with the diet, suggest that a larger trial is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory mechanisms are thought to contribute to the onset of psychosis in persons with an at-risk mental state (ARMS). We investigated whether the anti-inflammatory properties of minocycline and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3), alone or synergistically, would prevent transition to psychosis in ARMS in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Pakistan. METHODS: 10,173 help-seeking individuals aged 16-35 years were screened using the Prodromal Questionaire-16. Individuals scoring 6 and over were interviewed using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) to confirm ARMS. Participants (n = 326) were randomised to minocycline, omega-3, combined minocycline and omega-3 or to double placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was transition to psychosis at 12 months. FINDINGS: Forty-five (13.8 %) participants transitioned to psychosis. The risk of transition was greater in those randomised to omega-3 alone or in combination with minocycline (17.3.%), compared to 10.4 % in those not exposed to omega-3; a risk-ratio (RR) of 1.67, 95 % CI [0.95, 2.92] p = 0.07. The RR for transitions on minocycline vs. no minocycline was 0.86, 95 % CI [0.50, 1.49] p > 0.10. In participants who did not become psychotic, CAARMS and depression symptom scores were reduced at six and twelve months (mean CAARMS difference = 1.43; 95 % CI [0.33, 1.76] p < 0.01 in those exposed to omega-3. Minocycline did not affect CAARMS or depression scores. INTERPRETATION: In keeping with other studies, omega-3 appears to have beneficial effects on ARMS and mood symptom severity but it increased transition to psychosis, which may reflect metabolic or developmental consequences of chronic poor nutrition in the population. Transition to psychosis was too rare to reveal a preventative effect of minocycline but minocycline did not improve symptom severity.

AIM: We investigated the benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids associated with antioxidant vitamins in obese children. Magnesemia and calcemia were observed in relation with other metabolic parameters, before and after the treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 60 obese children were compared with 35 normal weight children. Each obese child received daily, one pill, containing: 130mg docosahexaenoic acid, 25mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, vitamin A 200µg, vitamin D 1,25µg, vitamin E 2,5mg and vitamin C 30mg for three months. All the participants were instructed not to change their lifestyle. RESULTS: The serum values for these minerals and for 25(OH) vitamin D were lower in obese children. The obese children had insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and an imbalance of serum adipocytokines. In obese children, the body mass index was negatively correlated with calcemia (r=-0.34) and serum 25(OH) vitamin D (r=-0.33). The HOMA-IR was negatively correlated with magnesemia (r=-0.34) and serum adiponectin (r=-0.29). The treatment improved the mineral serum level, the insulin sensitivity and the adipocytokines levels. CONCLUSION: In obese children, the intake of Omega-3 fatty acids associated with antioxidant vitamins, for three months improved calcemia and magnesemia and increased insulin sensitivity."

The study was conducted on 15 lactating Beetal goats for 3 months, which were divided into three groups. Treatment group T1 was kept as a control group with no linseed supplementation, whereas treatment group T2 received ground linseed at the rate 10% of concentrate per day per animal, and treatment group T3 received 20% ground linseed. The concentration of triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL concentration were found to be significantly lower (P < 0.05) in both 10% and 20% linseed supplemented group than the control group. Whereas, HDL concentration in T2 and T3 group were found to be significantly higher than the control group. The differential expression of targeted genes comparatively revealed highest relative expression in the group that received 20% linseed supplementation. Although the study did not show a significant effect of linseed supplementation on the expression of TLR-2 and IL-2 genes in goats, it highlights the potential benefits of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on immune system modulation in animals."

Whether higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with disease progression and survival in humans with pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the associations of plasma omega-3 fatty acid levels (a validated marker of omega-3 nutritional intake) with disease progression and transplant-free survival in pulmonary fibrosis? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Omega-3 fatty acid levels were measured from plasma samples of patients with clinically diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis from the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (n = 150), University of Virginia (n = 58), and University of Chicago (n = 101) cohorts. The N-3 index (docosahexaenoic acid + eicosapentaenoic acid) was the primary exposure variable of interest. Linear-mixed effects models with random intercept and slope were used to examine associations of plasma omega-3 fatty acid levels with changes in FVC and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide over a period of 12 months. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine transplant-free survival. Stratified analyses by telomere length were performed in the University of Chicago cohort. RESULTS: Most of the cohort were patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (88%) and male patients (74%). One-unit increment in log-transformed N-3 index plasma level was associated with a change in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 1.43 mL/min/mm Hg per 12 months (95% CI, 0.46-2.41) and a hazard ratio for transplant-free survival of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.24-0.83). Cardiovascular disease history, smoking, and antifibrotic usage did not significantly modify associations. Omega-3 fatty acid levels were not significantly associated with changes in FVC. Higher eicosapentaenoic acid plasma levels were associated with longer transplant-free survival among University of Chicago participants with shorter telomere length (P value for interaction = .02). INTERPRETATION: Further research is needed to investigate underlying biological mechanisms and whether omega-3 fatty acids are a potential disease-modifying therapy.",

However, data about the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on diabetic kidney disease in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are lacking. OBJECTIVES: This randomized-controlled trial assessed the effect of oral omega-3 supplementation on glycemic control, lipid profile, albuminuria level, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) in pediatric patients with T1DM and diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: Seventy T1DM patients and diabetic nephropathy were enrolled with a mean age 15.2 ± 1.96 years and median disease duration 7 years. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups; intervention group which received oral omega-3 fatty acids capsules (1 g daily). The other group received a matching placebo and served as a control group. Both groups were followed-up for 6 months with assessment of fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, fasting lipids, urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), KIM-1 and CIMT. RESULTS: After 6 months, omega-3 fatty acids adjuvant therapy for the intervention group resulted in a significant decrease in FBG, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, UACR, KIM-1 and CIMT, whereas, HDL-cholesterol was significantly higher post-therapy compared with baseline levels and compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Baseline KIM-1 levels were positively correlated to HbA1c, UACR and CIMT. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids was safe and well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acids as an adjuvant therapy in pediatric T1DM patients with diabetic nephropathy improved glycemic control, dyslipidemia and delayed disease progression and subclinical atherosclerosis among those patients.

Omega-3 fatty acids have well-established anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. The primary purpose of this pilot study was to assess whether omega-3 fatty acids could decrease P-APS and thus CIPN. METHODS: Patients scheduled to receive weekly paclitaxel for breast cancer were randomized to receive 4 g of omega-3 acid ethyl esters (Lovaza) or placebo, beginning 1 week prior and continued until paclitaxel was stopped. Patients completed acute pain questionnaires at baseline, daily after each treatment, and 1 month after completion of therapy. RESULTS: Sixty patients (49 evaluable) were randomized to treatment versus placebo. Seventeen (68.0%) patients receiving the omega-3 fatty acids intervention experienced P-APS, compared to 15 (62.5%) of those receiving placebo during the first week of treatment (p = 0.77). Over the full 12-week study, 21 (84.0%) patients receiving the omega-3 fatty acid intervention experienced P-APS, compared to 21 (87.5%) of those receiving placebo (p = 1.0). Secondary outcomes suggested that those in the intervention arm used more over-the-counter analgesics (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 0.72-3.78, p = 0.23), used more opiates (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 0.55-7.75, p = 0.28), and experienced higher levels of CIPN (12.8, 95% CI: 7.6-19.4 vs. 8.4, 95% CI: 4.6-13.2, p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study do not support further study of the use of omega-3 fatty acids for the prevention of the P-APS and CIPN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Number: NCT01821833.",

      "abstract": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) have been associated with several inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), and found to have an impact on gut microbiota. In fact, some randomized controlled studies suggest benefits to IBD patients, but others do not. Our aim was to review recent evidence on the effects of omega-3 on IBD and establish the contribution of the gut microbiome. Omega-3 mediate anti-inflammatory effects in IBD through various mechanisms, including suppression of NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) signaling; this results in the repression of the nuclear factor-kappa B (Nf-kB) pathway and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Omega-3 can also affect gut microbiota and revert the bacterial community to patterns associated with healthy status by increasing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and enhancing the mucosal gut barrier, thus promoting homeostasis. The combination of these immunoregulatory effects and anti-inflammation properties with the promotion of a balanced gut microbiome environment could suggest that omega-3 might benefit IBD patients. Considering the microbiota of IBD patients while using omega-3 might predict and improve omega-3 effectiveness. Combining omega-3 with bacteria-altering therapy, such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, may further enhance its efficacy; however, further studies are required to elucidate mechanisms and potential preventive or treatment roles of omega-3 in IBD.",

Many individuals benefit from pharmacotherapy including antidepressants, however, there is a fair likelihood of remission and recurrence. Of the several pathophysiologies, depression has been linked to inflammation. Complementary and alternative medications such as the use of omega-3 fatty acids are gaining popularity given their anti-inflammatory properties. The goal of this literature review is to assess the efficacy and the clinical use of omega-3 fatty acids in children and adolescents with depression. We conducted an extensive literature search on PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and PsycINFO from January 1, 2005, to September 2021, for published articles (case reports, systematic review, RCT) in any language. A total of seven published studies were included in our literature review. Results indicated a huge heterogenicity in the studies and hence the clinical use of omega-3 fatty acids as monotherapy in depression was not determined. However, it was well tolerated with an extremely low side effect profile. Further research on the use of omega-3 fatty acids as an adjunct to antidepressants would be valuable."

However, these recommendations are based on pathophysiological studies of inflammation rather than direct clinical evidence. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We retrieved literature from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANFANG, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Cochrane Library databases up to May 1, 2023. Data from studies comparing omega-3 fatty acids with a placebo or other pharmaceutical nutrients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 3032 records, 42 full-text articles were reviewed, five eligible studies were identified, and one study was found in the references. In total of six studies involving 273 patients were included, pooled, and analyzed. Compared to the control group, omega-3 fatty acid intervention reduced the overall mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (RR=0.76; 95% CI, [0.61, 0.93]; p=0.010). No serious or unexpected drug-related adverse events were observed. No statistical significance was observed in inflammatory markers such as CRP (MD=-9.69; 95% CI, [-22.52, 3.15]; p=0.14; I2=97%) and IL-6; however, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was significantly lower in the omega-3 FAs group on day 7 of intervention (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acid administration may be associated with reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Given the small sample size of enrolled studies, more rigorous and large-scale trials are urgently needed in the future to verify its efficacy.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to compare the standard treatment alone and adjunctive use of omega-3 PUFAs in combination with low-dose aspirin with or without standard treatment in patients with periodontitis. A systematic review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Central and Google Scholar databases. Selection criteria included the following: randomized controlled trials in subjects with periodontitis in the age group above 18 years old, with follow-up periods ranging from 6 weeks to 6 months. The meta-analysis was performed using standard methodological procedures according to Cochrane recommendations, including assessment of risk-of-bias and level of evidence (GRADE). Meta-analysis was performed for such clinical outcomes as plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP) and bleeding index (BI) based on data from seven randomized clinical trials conducted between 2010 and 2020. It was shown that adjunctive use of omega-3 PUFAs in combination with low-dose aspirin results in significant clinical improvement in PD, CAL and GI during both short and prolonged follow-up periods. The use of omega-3 PUFAs and low-dose aspirin in periodontitis patients may be promising as an adjunct therapy, however, due to a limited number of patients and significant heterogeneity, further studies need to be conducted.",

In this study, we assessed the efficacy of ω3-PUFAs in attenuating UUO injury and investigated their mechanism of action. The immortalized human proximal tubular cells human kidney-2 (HK2) were incubated for 72 h with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in various concentrations, in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. DHA/EPA reduced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the TGF-β-treated HK2 cells by enhancing autophagy flux and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups and treated as follows: sham (no treatment, n = 5), sham + ω3-PUFAs (n = 5), UUO (n = 10), and UUO + ω3-PUFAs (n = 10). Their kidneys and blood were harvested on the seventh day following UUO injury. The kidneys of the ω3-PUFAs-treated UUO mice showed less oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis compared to those of the untreated UUO mice. Greater autophagic flux, higher amounts of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II, Beclin-1, and Atg7, lower amounts of p62, and higher levels of cathepsin D and ATP6E were observed in the kidneys of the omega-3-treated UUO mice compared to those of the control UUO mice. In conclusion, ω3-PUFAs enhanced autophagic activation, leading to a renoprotective response against chronic kidney injury."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication in the acute care period following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in both short-term and long-term settings. Recently, the Vaughn Williams Classification of antiarrhythmic agents, first proposed in 1975 and widely viewed as the authoritative description of their electrophysiologic actions, was updated and notably omega-3 fatty acids (Ω-3 fatty acids) have been included in class VII, described as \"upstream target modulators,\" to mitigate pathological structural and electrophysiological remodeling changes in the aged and/or injured myocardium. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed literature search was performed. STUDY SELECTION: Studies examining the significance of complications in patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery were selected for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant data were qualitatively assessed and narratively summarized. DATA SYNTHESIS: POAF occurs in approximately 30% of patients, and inflammation from chronic coronary artery disease preoperatively, as well as acute atrial inflammation from surgery postoperatively are the leading causes. Inflammation underlies its pathophysiology; therefore Ω-3 fatty acids not only exhibit antiarrhythmic properties but are an effective anti-inflammatory treatment that may reduce the clinical risks of POAF. CONCLUSIONS: At present no effective prophylaxis is available to address POAF following CABG surgery. Clinical approaches that focus on the inflammatory response in this setting may optimize the response to treatment. The current literature supports the hypothesis that Ω-3 fatty acids may acutely reduce the inflammatory response via favorable alterations in the metabolism of prostaglandins and leukotrienes (eicosanoids) and specialized pro-resolving mediators."

      "abstract": "In the present study, the main objective was to reveal whether treatment by Omega-3 fatty acids could prevent the adverse effects of adolescent nicotine withdrawal on spatial and avoidance memory in male rats. For this purpose, Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests were performed on male Wistar rats and the hippocampal levels of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory indices, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nitrite, amyloid-B and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured. Moreover, density of dark neurons were assessed in CA1 and CA3 regions. Results showed that adolescent nicotine exposure followed by a period of drug cessation exacerbates the behavioral indices of learning and memory through affecting a variety of biochemical markers within the hippocampal tissues. These changes lead to elevation of oxidative and inflammatory markers, reduction of neurotrophic capacity and increased AChE activity in hippocampal tissues. In addition, it was observed that co-administration of nicotine with Omega-3 fatty acids significantly prevents nicotine withdrawal-induced adverse effects through restoration of the mentioned biochemical disturbances. Therefore, we suggest administration of Omega-3 fatty acids as a safe, inexpensive and effective therapeutic strategy for prevention of memory dysfunctions associated with nicotine abstinence during adolescence.",

      "abstract": "Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and serious neuropsychiatric syndrome among older patients, and lacks effective therapies. Omega-3 fatty acids, possessing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, have shown potent neuroprotective effects in several diseases. The present study investigated whether omega-3 fatty acids could exert a neuroprotective role against POD in aged mice. A mouse model of POD was established to explore the role of omega-3 fatty acids in laparotomy-induced delirium-like behavior by evaluating systemic inflammatory changes, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and behavior at different time points in aged mice. Oral gavage with omega-3 fatty acids (300 mg/kg) for 3 weeks before surgery significantly attenuated anesthesia/surgery-induced POD-like behavior and the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines from the peripheral blood in aged mice. Moreover, it also remarkably mitigated neuroinflammation and the oxidative stress response (malondialdehyde [MDA] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of surgical mice. Our findings provided evidence that pretreatment with omega-3 fatty acids may play a vital role in the treatment of POD through mechanisms involving its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may be a promising prevention strategy for POD in aged patients.",
