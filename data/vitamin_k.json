      "abstract": "Background: Vitamin K is a cofactor necessary for the biological activity of proteins like Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), which reduce calcification and help preserve lung function. This study aims to determine, first, whether low vitamin K status is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and secondary, whether the level of vitamin K is associated with COPD severity, smoking exposure, or mortality. Methods: The plasma concentration of dephosphorylated uncarboxylated (dp-uc) MGP was used as an inverse biomarker for vitamin K in 98 COPD patients from the CODEX-P COPD study and 986 controls from the DanFunD study. Low vitamin K status was defined as the upper quartile of dp-ucMGP (>589 pmol/L). Using a logistic regression model, we examined whether low vs. high/moderate vitamin K status increased the odds ratio (OR) of having COPD. Secondary analyses, in the COPD cohort only, examined the association between low vitamin K status and COPD severity, smoking exposure in packyears and all-cause mortality, using a Welch's t-test and log-rank test, respectively. Results: Low vitamin K status was associated with increased odds of having COPD, OR 9.7 (95% CI [5.5 to 17.5], p < 0.001). We found no associations between low vitamin K and COPD severity (est. -0.03, p = 0.7; 95% CI [-0.2 to 0.1]), smoking exposure (p = 0.7), or all-cause mortality (p = 0.5). Conclusions: Low vitamin K status was associated with substantially higher odds of having COPD compared to high/moderate vitamin K status. No association was found between low vitamin K status and COPD severity, smoking exposure, or all-cause mortality. Further studies are needed to determine if vitamin K plays a role in the pathophysiology of COPD and whether supplement therapy is indicated."

      "abstract": "Vitamin K (VK) deficiency (VKD) commonly causes coagulopathy across the age spectrum. The reduced form of VK is an essential cofactor for the post-translational γ-carboxylation of coagulation factors (Fs) II, VII, IX, and X; proteins C and S; and additional proteins. This carboxylation creates high-affinity calcium-binding sites that are important for their functions. VK is a fat-soluble vitamin, with half of the daily needs met by vitamin K1 from the diet (particularly green leafy vegetables) and the other half met by vitamin K2 produced by gut flora. VKD can develop within days because of limited tissue stores of VK. VKD increases risks for bleeding, with neonates and infants at the highest risk unless they are administered routine VK prophylaxis at birth. Diagnosing VKD is challenging because of the different forms and half-lives of VK isoforms. Often, patients with suspected VKD-related coagulopathies are assessed for coagulopathy correction within 1-2 days after receiving VK, either orally or parenterally. VKD increases the plasma levels of proteins induced by the absence of VK, such as des-γ-carboxylated factor II, which is more commonly used as a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma than as a VKD biomarker. VKD causes notable discrepancies in FII levels measured by factor assays based on the prothrombin time (PT) rather than Ecarin reagents, as the Ecarin prothrombin activator directly converts normal and des-γ-carboxylated FII to meizothrombin (resulting in higher FII levels than estimated with PT reagents). In this review, we summarize current information on the causes, consequences, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of VKD."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide further data support for the treatment of COVID-19 by conducting a comprehensive analysis of reports on dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which detects the functional vitamin K status post COVID-19 infection, using meta-analysis. METHODS: This study conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of relevant research on dp-ucMGP detection in patients infected with COVID-19 through meta-analysis. The article collection period ranged from January 2024 to April 2024. RESULTS: A total of 6 articles were included in this study. Baseline data analysis showed that the age of patients in the COVID-19 infected group was greater than that of the non-infected control group (p = 0.030); similarly, the age of patients in the severe infection group was also greater than that of the mild infection group (p = 0.003). In the analysis of underlying diseases, statistical differences were found between the Severe group and Mild group in the presence of CVD (p = 0.010). A total of 5 studies conducted dp-ucMGP detection in both the COVID-19 infected group and the control group. The results showed that the expression of dp-ucMGP was higher in the infected group than in the control group (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that the expression of dp-ucMGP in the severe infection group was also higher than that in the mild infection group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infected patients exhibit Low Vitamin K Status, which correlates positively with the severity of infection. Supplementation of vitamin K during COVID-19 infection may potentially mitigate the progression toward severe infection, necessitating further support from clinical data."

      "abstract": "AIM: Vascular calcification contributes to morbidity and mortality in aging and is accelerated in diabetes and in chronic kidney disease. Matrix Gla Protein is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification, which is activated by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX). However, through a currently unidentified mechanism, the activity of GGCX is reduced in experimental uremia, thereby contributing to the promotion of vascular calcifications. In this study, we aim to identify the cause of these functional alterations and to stimulate the enzyme activity by potential GGCX binding compounds as a new avenue of therapy. METHODS: Two rodent models of experimental uremia and human carotid plaques were assessed for GGCX activity and modifications, as well as calcification. In silico compound screening via BindScope identified potential binding partners of GGCX which were further validated in functional assays for enzymatic activity changes and for in vitro calcification. Mass spectrometry was applied to monitor molecular mass changes of the GGCX. RESULTS: Mass spectrometry analysis revealed post-translational modifications of the GGCX in uremic rats and mice, as well as in calcified human carotid plaques. Functional assays showed that the post-translational carbamylation of GGCX reduced the enzyme activity, which was prevented by vitamin K2. Chrysin, identified by compound screening, stimulated GGCX activity, reduced calcium deposition in VSMCs, and oxidized GGCX at lysine 517. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that the vitamin K-dependent enzyme GGCX plays a significant role in uremic calcification and may be modulated to help prevent pathological changes.",

      "abstract": "Optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy for left ventricular thrombous (LVT) is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness and safety of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) up to 12 months in patients with LVT. Patients diagnosed with LVT between 2011 and 2023 and treated with VKAs until LVT resolution or up to 12 months were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. Primary outcome included on-treatment LVT resolution, secondary outcomes acute ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral embolism, and major and clinically relevant non-major bleedings during the 12-month follow-up. Ninety patients were included. Median age was 66 years and 78.9% were male. Mean time in therapeutic range was 61% and 32.9% of patients received VKA monotherapy, with the remaining concomitant antiplatelet treatment. The 3, 6, 12 months cumulative incidences of LVT resolution were 27% (95% confidence intervals -95%CI-, 18%-36%), 47% (95%CI 36%-57%), and 70% (95% CI 60%-79%), respectively. At Cox regression model, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (Hazard Ratio 0.48; 95%CI 0.24-0.95) and left-ventricular aneurysms (Hazard Ratio 0.44; 95%CI 0.22-0.88) were associated with reduced LVT resolution. One patient developed an acute ischemic stroke and one an acute myocardial infarction. Two patients developed a major and four a clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Incidence of LVT resolution appeared to be higher at 12 than at 3 and 6 months of follow-up, and the rates of on-treatment acute arterial and bleeding events were low. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and left-ventricular aneurysm appeared to be associated with a lower rates of LVT resolution."

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in people over the age of 55. AMD currently affects approximately 8% of the world's population, and the number is growing as the global population ages. Growing evidence suggests that pathological choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is often related to more severe and rapid vision loss and blindness associated with AMD. The typical clinical treatment is intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. However, some patients do not respond well to this therapy, and the potential risks of long-term repeated injections cannot be ignored. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the specific mechanisms of CNV development and find new, safe, and effective treatments. In this study, our data indicate that ferroptotic damage of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and its induced VEGFA overexpression are critical promoting factors in the development of CNV. Vitamin K can mediate the protection of RPE cells from ferroptotic damage and regulate the expression of eIF2α-ATF4-VEGFA in a VKOR/FSP1-dependent manner, inhibiting new angiogenesis to alleviate CNV. On the contrary, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) represented by warfarin, can promote RPE ferroptotic damage and related vascular proliferation in mice and eventually aggravate CNV lesions. However, vitamin K still showed significant protective effects even in the presence of VKA. Due to its significant anti-ferroptosis and anti-neovascular effects, as well as its relative safety and convenience of use, vitamin K has excellent potential in the treatment of CNV and is expected to become a clinically effective and safe new CNV treatment strategy.",

      "abstract": "Fictitious disorder by proxy (FDP) is characterized by an adult, often a parent, alleging or fabricating symptoms in a child to induce repeated diagnostic tests or treatments. This form of abuse is particularly serious and difficult to diagnose. Worldwide, it is estimated that 0.5 to 1.2 per 100,000 children are abused in this way every year. We report the case of FDP in an 8-year-old child who presented with coagulation disorders secondary to the unknowing administration of Acenocoumarin. His parents had requested seven medical consultations over a six-month period. The parents systematically reported a coagulation pathology (factor VII deficiency), prompting further investigations and treatment. Biological tests showed deficiencies of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, raising suspicion of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) use. Toxicological tests revealed the presence of Acenocoumarin in the child's blood three times, at levels of 0.15 mg/L; 0.06 mg/L and 0.43 mg/L. The biological abnormalities corrected spontaneously after the child was hospitalized. A family investigation led to the diagnosis of medical child abuse in the child's older sister, who presented bleeding. The severity and recurrence of this syndrome correlated with the role that caregivers play in this type of abuse deserves our full attention to prevent and manage it as effectively as possible."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-dose (0.5 mg/day) colchicine improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stable coronary disease. Around 10-15% of these patients simultaneously use anticoagulant therapy, including vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs). In vitro studies and case reports have described a possible interaction between colchicine and VKAs leading to increased INR, but controlled studies are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate if there is a drug-drug interaction between low-dose colchicine and VKAs in patients with chronic coronary disease. METHODS: This study was a sub-analysis of the randomized low-dose colchicine for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease 2 (LoDoCo2) trial. This placebo-controlled trial investigated efficacy of colchicine 0.5 mg once daily in patients with chronic coronary disease. For the current study, we included a selection of Dutch patients who concomitantly used a VKA. Following a 30 days open-label colchicine run-in phase, patients were randomized to colchicine or placebo. The primary outcome was the intra-patient difference in international normalized ratio (INR) during the first month after starting or stopping colchicine as compared to the preceding month. Secondary outcomes included changes in VKA daily dosage, assessed in the same pattern and before and after randomization, and time in therapeutic range (TTR), assessed before and after randomization to reflect long-term effects. INR measurements were part of routine clinical care. RESULTS: In total, 73 patients were included (35 colchicine and 38 in the placebo group). No significant intra-patient change in INR was observed after starting colchicine during the open-label run-in phase (mean INR: 2.60 before vs. 2.67 during run-in, difference 0.07, 95% CI - 0.13 to 0.26; p = 0.50). Similarly, stopping colchicine treatment (i.e., randomization to placebo) did not significantly alter INR levels (mean INR: 2.70 during run-in vs. 2.81 after randomization, difference 0.11, 95% CI - 0.12 to 0.33; p = 0.34). The change in mean VKA daily dosage was - 0.01 mg (95% CI - 0.03 to 0.01; p = 0.35) when starting colchicine and - 0.01 mg (95% CI - 0.03 to 0.01; p = 0.41) when switching to placebo. TTR in patients allocated to active treatment was 65.8% in the year prior to the start of colchicine and 73.4% in the year after randomization to colchicine (change in TTR 7.56%, 95% CI - 0.14 to 15.26%; p = 0.05). Mean VKA dosage remained similar (change in VKA dosage of 0.01 mg; 95% CI - 0.11 to 0.13 mg; p = 0.84). CONCLUSION: No significant changes in INR, VKA dosage, or TTR in patients using VKAs after starting or stopping colchicine were observed. These results suggest that there is no need for additional INR monitoring beyond the standard of care when using low-dose colchicine, though further studies in larger populations would help to confirm this conclusion.",

      "abstract": "Gamma-carboxylation, catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), is a critical post-translational modification essential for the biological activity of vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs). Mutations in GGCX, depending on their specific location, result in vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency type 1 (VKCFD1), which encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe, including bleeding disorders, osteoporosis, and vascular calcification. The limited knowledge of GGCX's structure and functional regions hinders our understanding of the consequences of GGCX mutations and the treatment for VKCFD1. This study aimed to identify key functional regions of GGCX and their interactions with VKDPs to better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse clinical symptoms. Using AlphaFold 3 and molecular dynamics simulations, we developed a complex binding model of GGCX, FIX, and reduced vitamin K, which revealed critical regions and residues involved in their interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis and cell-based assays further validated the model, confirming that multisite and regional cooperative binding of FIX to GGCX plays a key role in modulating γ-carboxylation efficiency. Additionally, novel residues (I296, M303, M401, M402) were identified as essential for GGCX's dual enzymatic activities: carboxylation and vitamin K epoxidation. We further demonstrated that the spatial proximity of these active sites supports the hypothesis that GGCX's carboxylation and vitamin K epoxidation centers are interconnected, ensuring the efficient coupling of these processes. Our GGCX-FIX binding and carboxylation model aligns with known pathogenic GGCX mutations, providing valuable insights into the molecular basis of coagulation disorders caused by GGCX mutants."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Balancing the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains clinically challenging. Questions regarding the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after TAVR still need to be definitively answered. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs after TAVR in individuals with and without indication for anticoagulation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 7 October 2023 together with reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR in adults with or without an indication for anticoagulation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods and conducted random-effects pair-wise analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs). Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included four RCTs with 4808 participants in the NMA. Of these, one compared rivaroxaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared apixaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation or versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared edoxaban versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; and one compared edoxaban with antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR. The mean age of trial participants was 81 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 18 months. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in the included trials to be low in all domains except for blinding, which was assessed as high in all four studies. No studies evaluated dabigatran. In people without an indication for anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality after TAVR as compared to antiplatelet therapy (rivaroxaban: risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.46; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence; apixaban: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.02; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence), while edoxaban may result in little or no difference (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.36; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality (rivaroxaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.10; studies = 1, participants = 1644; apixaban: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.65; studies = 1, participants = 1049; edoxaban: RR 7.44, 95% CI 0.39 to 142.38; studies = 1, participants = 229) and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke (rivaroxaban: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00; studies = 1, participants = 1644; edoxaban: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; studies = 1, participants = 229). While rivaroxaban versus antiplatelets probably increases major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.65; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence), there may be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if edoxaban has an effect on major bleeding, although the point estimate suggests increased bleeding (versus antiplatelets: RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.30; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). In people with an indication for anticoagulation, low-certainty evidence suggests apixaban or edoxaban may result in little to no difference in our predefined primary efficacy outcomes after TAVR when compared to VKA (all-cause mortality: apixaban: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20; studies = 1, participants = 1426; cardiovascular mortality: apixaban: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.57; studies = 1, participants = 1426; stroke: apixaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; studies = 1, participants = 1426). While apixaban may result in a similar rate of bleeding as VKA in this population, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding after TAVR in people with an indication for anticoagulation (apixaban: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.54; studies = 1, participants = 451; low-certainty evidence; edoxaban: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; studies = 1, participants = 1426; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In people without an indication for oral anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality when compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban may result in little or no difference. There might be little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality, and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke. While rivaroxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR, there might be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and the effect of edoxaban on major bleeding remains unclear. In people with an indication for anticoagulation, apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as VKA in preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Apixaban may lead to a similar rate of major bleeding as VKA in this population. However, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR when compared to VKA. Our NMA did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the primary outcomes. Head-to-head trials directly comparing NOACs against each other are required to increase the certainty of the evidence.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for high-quality data from prospective studies on the safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of DOACs versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for the treatment of CVT in a setting that reflects daily clinical practice. METHODS: DOAC-CVT was an international, prospective, observational cohort study done in 65 hospitals in 23 countries across five continents. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) with radiologically confirmed CVT starting oral anticoagulant treatment with either DOACs or VKAs, as per local practice, within 30 days after diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were previous use of anticoagulants at the time of CVT diagnosis or an absolute contraindication to DOACs (eg, pregnancy and lactation, or severe renal or liver disease). Data were collected during routine clinical visits or telephone consultations at CVT diagnosis (baseline) and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after CVT diagnosis. The primary endpoint was a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism and major bleeding events (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria) at 6 months. Main outcomes were adjusted for the confounders age, renal function, active cancer, CNS infections, concomitant antiplatelet use, country of inclusion's income status, Glasgow Coma Scale score, intracranial haemorrhage, antiphospholipid antibodies, previous major bleeding, and previous venous thromboembolism using inverse probability-of-treatment weighting. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04660747) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Jan 27, 2021, and Jan 15, 2024, 619 patients were included; 401 (65%) patients started DOAC treatment, and 218 (35%) patients started VKA treatment. 390 (63%) of 619 patients were female and 229 (37%) of 619 patients were male. Patients' median age was 41 years (IQR 28-51). 6-month follow-up data were available for 617 (>99%) of 619 patients. 12 (3%) of 401 patients in the DOAC group and seven (3%) of 218 patients in the VKA group had a primary outcome event (weighted odds ratio [OR] 0·99 [95% CI 0·37-3·38]). Three (1%) of 401 patients in the DOAC group died versus three (1%) of 218 patients in the VKA group (weighted OR 0·55 [95% CI 0·11-2·80]). INTERPRETATION: The rate of recurrent thrombosis and major bleeding did not differ between patients with CVT treated with DOACs versus VKAs. This study adds to the increasing evidence that DOACs are a reasonable treatment option for CVT alongside VKAs. FUNDING: Netherlands Thrombosis Foundation.",

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants offer reduced bleeding risks, fixed dosing without frequent monitoring, and fewer drug and dietary interactions. Their effectiveness has been demonstrated in preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation, managing venous thromboembolism, and offering new options for patients with coronary artery disease and cancer-associated thrombosis. However, challenges remain, including bleeding risks, high costs, and limited efficacy in certain patient populations. Current research is focused on addressing these limitations, with Factor XI inhibitors emerging as a promising advancement for safer anticoagulation.

METHOD: This study is a single-center retrospective chart review utilizing the hospital electronic health record. The prevalence and percentage of bleeding events were reported for each antithrombotic regimen. RESULTS: Of the 539 patients receiving oral anticoagulants, 202 were using oral anticoagulants in combination with either single or dual antiplatelet therapy. Out of 35 patients using triple antithrombotic therapy, four (11.4%) experienced major bleeding. Based on the analysis of 73 patients using anticoagulants in combined with clopidogrel, the results showed that one patient (1.3%) suffered bleeding. Among the 94 patients treated with anticoagulants plus aspirin, seven (7.4%) experienced major bleeding events. CONCLUSION: The combination of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents is associated with an elevated bleeding risk. Patients receiving triple antithrombotic therapy experience high prevalence of bleeding. Nonetheless, the group receiving anticoagulant and clopidogrel alone exhibited low prevalence of bleeding risk."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In several settings, therapeutic-dose non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are superior to aspirin for the prevention of arterial and venous thromboembolism. PURPOSE: To estimate differences in bleeding risks between NOACs and single antiplatelet therapy. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to June 2024 without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing therapeutic-dose NOACs versus single antiplatelet therapy, with a minimum treatment duration of 3 months. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction was done independently and in duplicate. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nine RCTs with 26 224 participants were included. All studies used aspirin as antiplatelet therapy. Compared with aspirin, apixaban had similar rates of major bleeding (risk difference [RD], 0.0 percentage point [95% CI, -1.3 to 2.6 percentage points]; 5 trials) and intracranial hemorrhage (RD, -0.2 percentage point [CI, -0.6 to 1.4 percentage points]; 5 trials). Compared with aspirin, dabigatran had similar rates of major bleeding (RD, 0.5 percentage point [CI, -2.1 to 19.6 percentage points]; 2 trials) and intracranial hemorrhage (RD, 0.0 percentage point [CI, -1.1 to 24.5 percentage points]; 2 trials). Compared with aspirin, rivaroxaban had higher rates of major bleeding (RD, 0.9 percentage point [CI, -0.1 to 3.7 percentage points]; 2 trials) and intracranial hemorrhage (RD, 0.3 percentage point [CI, -0.1 to 79.7 percentage points]; 2 trials). The evidence certainty ranged from low to moderate. LIMITATION: Confidence intervals were wide and included the possibility of a null effect. CONCLUSION: In this systematic review of RCTs, rates of major bleeding for therapeutic-dose apixaban and dabigatran were similar to those for low-dose aspirin, whereas rates were higher for rivaroxaban.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has emerged as a viable therapy option in patients with severe mitral regurgitation and high surgical risk. Although atrial fibrillation is common among patients undergoing M-TEER, the optimal anticoagulatory treatment after the intervention is unknown. METHODS: A single-center retrospective observational analysis was conducted using data from the M-TEER registry at the University Hospital Cologne collected from 2019 untill 2021 including patients undergoing M-TEER between November 2012 and April 2019. Patients with atrial fibrillation receiving consistent anticoagulation following M-TEER were categorized into a direct oral anticoagulant or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) group. The primary end point was a composite of ischemic cerebrovascular and bleeding events. Additionally, overall survival was assessed. RESULTS: Among 613 patients undergoing M-TEER, 206 met the inclusion criteria, with 61 receiving direct oral anticoagulants and 145 receiving VKAs. After a median follow-up of 833 (interquartile range, 355-1271) days, the incidence of the composite primary end point did not differ between direct oral anticoagulant and VKA groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51 [95% CI, 0.23-1.12]; P=0.07). Similarly, rates of ischemic cerebrovascular events and bleeding events were similar between groups. However, the overall mortality rate was higher in the VKA group (HR, 2.56 [95% CI, 1.54-4.26]; P=0.002). In the multivariable analysis, oral anticoagulation with a VKA was an independent predictor for death (adjusted HR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.08-5.06]; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that direct oral anticoagulants may offer comparable efficacy and safety to VKAs in preventing thromboembolic events following M-TEER in patients with atrial fibrillation. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm these results and establish optimal anticoagulation strategies in this patient population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People undergoing major orthopaedic surgery are at increased risk of postoperative thromboembolic events. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are recommended for thromboprophylaxis in this population. New oral anticoagulants, including direct factor Xa inhibitors, are recommended as alternatives. They may have more advantages than disadvantages compared to LMWHs and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, another type of anticoagulant). OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of prophylactic anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors compared with low molecular weight heparins and vitamin K antagonists in people undergoing major orthopaedic surgery for elective total hip or knee replacement or hip fracture surgery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registers to 11 November 2023. We conducted reference checks to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of direct factor Xa inhibitors to LMWHs or VKAs in people undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, major venous thromboembolism (VTE), symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and serious hepatic and non-hepatic adverse events. We evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies using Cochrane's risk of bias 1 tool. We calculated estimates of treatment effects using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 53 RCTs (44,371 participants). Participants' average age was 64 years (range: 18 to 93 years). Only one RCT compared a VKA with direct factor Xa inhibitors. All 53 RCTs compared direct factor Xa inhibitors with LMWHs. Twenty-three studies included participants undergoing total hip replacement; 21 studies, total knee replacement; and three studies included people having hip fracture surgery. The studies' average duration was approximately 42 days (range: two to 720 days). Compared to LMWHs, direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.31; I2 = 0%; 28 studies, 29,698 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Direct factor Xa inhibitors may make little to no difference to major venous thromboembolic events compared to LMWHs, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; absolute risk difference: 12 fewer major VTE events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 16 fewer to 7 fewer; I2 = 48%; 28 studies, 24,574 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Compared to LMWHs, direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83; I2 = 0%; 33 studies, 31,670 participants; low-certainty evidence). The absolute benefit of substituting factor Xa inhibitors for LMWHs may be between two and five fewer symptomatic VTE episodes per 1000 patients. In the meta-analysis with all studies pooled, direct factor Xa inhibitors appeared to make little or no difference to major bleeding compared to LMWHs, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; I2 = 15%; 36 studies, 39,778 participants; very low certainty-evidence). • In a subgroup analysis limited to studies comparing rivaroxaban to LMWHs, people given rivaroxaban may have had more major bleeding events (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.98; I2 = 0%; 17 studies, 17,630 participants; low-certainty evidence). The absolute risk of substituting rivaroxaban for LMWH may be between one and seven more major bleeding events per 1000 patients. • In a subgroup analysis limited to studies comparing direct factor Xa inhibitors other than rivaroxaban to LMWHs, people given these other direct factor Xa inhibitors may have had fewer major bleeding events, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.02; absolute risk difference: 3 fewer major bleeding events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 5 fewer to 0 fewer; I2 = 0%; 19 studies, 22,148 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Direct factor Xa inhibitors may make little to no difference in serious hepatic adverse events compared to LMWHs, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 3.01, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.93; 2 studies, 3169 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Only two studies reported this outcome, with one death in the intervention group due to hepatitis reported in one study, and no events reported in the other study. People given direct factor Xa inhibitors may have a lower risk of serious non-hepatic adverse events than those given LMWHs (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; I2 = 18%; 15 studies, 26,246 participants; low-certainty evidence). The absolute benefit of substituting factor Xa inhibitors for LMWH may be between three and 14 fewer serious non-hepatic adverse events per 1000 patients. Only one study compared a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a VKA. It reported outcome data with imprecise results due to the small number of events. It showed no difference in the effects of the study drugs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may slightly reduce symptomatic VTE events when compared with LMWH. They may make little or no difference to major VTE events, but the evidence is very uncertain. In the evaluation of major bleeding, the evidence suggests rivaroxaban results in a slight increase in major bleeding events compared to LMWHs. The remaining oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on major bleeding, but the evidence is very uncertain. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce serious non-hepatic adverse events slightly compared to LMWHs. They may have little to no effect on serious hepatic adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. Due to the high rates of missing participants and selective outcome reporting, the effect estimates may be biased.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Vitamin K deficiency in chronic kidney disease (CKD) could potentially occur due to multiple factors, leading to an increased risk of vascular and valvular calcifications. Vitamin K status can be indirectly assessed by measuring the blood levels of vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs), such as matrix GLA protein (MGP). This study aims to examine the relationship between the levels of inactive MGP (dp-uc MGP) and the presence of valvular calcifications, as well as its association with mortality in hemodialysis patients. Methods: We conducted a single-center study that included 45 CKD G5D patients (hemodialysis for 6 months to 10 years) followed up for 24 months. All patients have been assessed at baseline regarding cardiovascular disease (medical history, echocardiography). Moreover, using standard methods, we determined blood biochemistry, complete blood count, and matrix GLA protein. At 24 months of follow-up, we assessed all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Results: In the studied hemodialysis patients, mean dp-uc MGP was 3285.93 +/- 2092.85 pmol/L. Patients with valvular calcifications had higher levels of dp-uc MGP compared to those without (4521.08 +/- 2263.82 vs. 2487.53 +/- 1446.94 pmol/L, however not statistically significant). The presence and severity of valvular calcifications were significantly associated with the history of treatment with vitamin K antagonists (p < 0.05). After 24 months of follow-up, we found an all-cause mortality rate of 24.4%. The level of dp-uc MGP was higher in the group of patients that died (3884.81 +/- 2439.20 vs. 3133.09 +/- 1925.26 pmol/L, p > 0.05). Patients with more than one valvular calcification on echocardiography had a significantly higher all-cause mortality risk (p = 0.04). In terms of traditional risk factors, we observed an increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.02) and aortic stenosis (p = 0.01). However, other cardiovascular markers, such as coronary heart disease and ejection fraction < 50%, did not have a statistically significant impact on mortality in our patients. Conclusions: In our study, we found that vitamin K deficiency, measured indirectly using the level of VKDP, especially dp-uc MGP, is a predictor of valvular calcifications. Severe valvular calcifications, aortic stenosis, and the presence of diabetes mellitus are risk factors for all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients."

      "abstract": "Data on risks and benefits of long-term anticoagulants in patients with a life-limiting disease are limited. This cohort study aims to describe (dis)continuation of anticoagulants and incidences of bleeding and thromboembolic events in vitamin K antagonist (VKA) users with a life-limiting disease.Data from five Dutch anticoagulation clinics were linked to data from Statistics Netherlands and the Netherlands Cancer registry. Prevalent VKA users diagnosed with a pre-specified life-limiting disease between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2019 were included and followed until December 31, 2019. Bleeding and thromboembolic events were identified by hospitalization data. Cumulative incidences of anticoagulant discontinuation, accounting for death as competing risk, and event rates for both anticoagulant exposed and unexposed person-years (PYs) were determined.Among 18,145 VKA users (median age 81 years [IQR: 74-86], 49% females, median survival time 2.03 years [95%CI: 1.97-2.10]), the most common life-limiting diseases were heart disease (60.0%), hip fracture (18.1%), and cancer (13.5%). One year after diagnosis, the cumulative incidence of anticoagulant discontinuation was 14.0% (95%CI: 13.5-14.6). Over 80% of patients continued anticoagulant therapy until the last month before death, with median 14 days between discontinuation and death. Event rates per 100 PYs (95%CI) were comparable during anticoagulant use and after discontinuation for bleeding 2.6 (2.4-2.8) versus 2.1 (1.5-2.8), venous thromboembolism 0.2 (0.1-0.2) versus 0.4 (0.2-0.7), and arterial thromboembolism 3.1 (2.9-3.3) versus 3.3 (2.6-4.2).Most VKA users with a life-limiting disease continued anticoagulant treatment during their last phase of life, with similar rates of bleeding and thromboembolic events during use and after discontinuation."

      "abstract": "Vitamin K deficiency is a common entity in infancy characterized by bleeding from various sites, intracranial bleeding being the most commonly reported feature. Nodular purpura is an uncommon manifestation of vitamin K deficiency in infancy with a few reported cases in literature. We present four cases of infants presenting with nodular purpura as a manifestation of late-onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). All four children presented with asymptomatic bluish-gray nodules, along with symptoms of hepatic dysfunction. Coagulation profile was deranged in all four children and symptoms improved with the administration of parenteral Vitamin K. The case series details the clinical course, treatment response, and follow-up for each patient. To conclude, nodular purpura can be a rare presentation of late-onset VKDB. \"Warning bleeds\" of VKDB are known to precede dangerous intracranial bleeds. Late-onset VKDB cannot be prevented by routine neonatal vitamin K prophylaxis and requires repeated vitamin K treatments. The case series is an attempt to highlight the unusual manifestation of a bleeding disorder that can be easily prevented by early intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamic acid carboxylation (Gla) proteins are calcium-binding and membrane-associated, participating in coagulation, bone turnover, and cancer biology. The molecular function of transmembrane proline-rich Gla proteins (PRRGs) remains unexplored. METHODS: Analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) datasets, including transcription profiles, clinical data, and tissue microarrays, was conducted to evaluate PRRG1 expression and its clinical relevance. PDAC cell lines with overexpressed, knockdown, and mutated PRRG1 were developed to study biological functions and pathways using RNA-seq, co-immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. In vivo xenograft and orthotopic models assessed PRRG1's impact on PDAC progression, with and without warfarin treatment. RESULTS: PRRG1 was significantly upregulated in PDAC compared to normal pancreas, correlating with poorer patient survival. PRRG1 knockdown reduced PDAC cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. PRRG1 localized at the plasma membrane, interacted with the HECT E3 ligase NEDD4 via the C-terminal PPXY motif, and promoted NEDD4 self-ubiquitination, reducing its protein levels. PRRG1 knockdown elevated NEDD4, destabilizing the oncoprotein KRAS and receptor EGFR, and attenuating downstream signaling and macropinocytosis under nutrient deprivation. The vitamin K-dependent Gla modification of PRRG1 was crucial for its membrane localization and pro-tumorigenic effects, and was inhibited by low-dose warfarin, a clinical vitamin K antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies PRRG1 as a key regulator of pro-tumorigenic signaling in PDAC, suggesting the potential of repurposing the anticoagulant warfarin as a therapeutic strategy. KEY POINTS: PRRG1 is identified as the transmembrane Gla protein mediating PDAC malignancy. PRRG1 recruits and induces self-ubiquitination of membrane-anchoring E3 ligase NEDD4. PRRG1 exerts a protective role toward KRAS and EGFR by inhibiting NEDD4. The anticoagulant warfarin can be utilized to inhibit PRRG1 and PDAC advancement.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) continue to be the principal anticoagulants for both the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. The use of VKA often requires regular monitoring to avoid over-anticoagulation and prevent thromboembolic complications. The aim was to determine the indication for VKA use and factors associated with suboptimal anticoagulation control among patients in northern Tanzania. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that examined the anticoagulation data of patients on long-term VKA from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2022. Eligible participants were those on VKAs for at least 7 days and with at least 3 international normalized ratio (INR) results. The level of anticoagulation control was determined through the calculation of the time-in-therapeutic range (TiTR) using the Rosendaal and the percent of INR in therapeutic range methods. RESULTS: TiTR was found to be 17% using the direct method and 16% using the Rosendaal formula. 102 tests out of 365 were within the target range (28%). Absence of health insurance (aRR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.06-1.44, P = .007), alcohol consumption (aRR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.15-1.62, P < .001), and prolonged intervals between tests of 14 to 28 days (aRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.05-1.74, P = .018) showed association with INR being out of range. CONCLUSION: Patients who achieved target therapeutic anticoagulation control were less than the acceptable 65%. Anticoagulation outcomes were better in patients with frequent INR monitoring and those with health insurance. Alcohol consumption carries a high risk of poor anticoagulation control. Further studies are needed to enforce better INR control.",

Those with OPLL had significantly longer prothrombin times and lower plasma protein C concentrations, consistent with vitamin K deficiency. Therefore, we next characterised the effects of vitamin K supplementation on spinal hyperostosis in ttw mice, a model of cervical OPLL, by feeding them standard chow, vitamin K-deficient chow, or standard chow accompanied by biweekly vitamin K2 injections for 6 weeks. We found that vitamin K supplementation resulted in longer stride lengths and superior inter-limb coordination using footprint analysis. Furthermore, supplementation caused a significant reduction in ectopic calcification of the cervical ligaments of the mice, according to microcomputed tomography analysis. Finally, supplementation caused an increase in the number of osteochondrogenic cells expressing Gla-rich protein, an inhibitor of ectopic calcification, and increased the circulating concentration. Thus, vitamin K insufficiency may be involved in the pathogenesis of OPLL and supplementation may represent a novel treatment for this condition.",

While guidelines exist for managing elevated prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (INR) in patients on warfarin, the treatment for warfarin overdose in these patients is yet to be standardized. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old woman ingested 230 mg of warfarin with suicidal intent, along with other medications. Initially unconscious, her INR was 1.0, and laboratory results were normal. Prophylactic continuous menaquinone-4, vitamin K2, injections were administered before the INR increased. After stopping vitamin K2 72 h later, her INR rose to 1.8, but she recovered without severe coagulopathy or bleeding, despite a high initial warfarin concentration. CONCLUSION: This is the first case of warfarin overdose managed with prophylactic vitamin K2 injections before INR elevation, successfully preventing severe complications. Prophylactic vitamin K infusion may be a practical approach for warfarin overdose treatment in non-dependent patients."

This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effect of VK3-mediated PDI against Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens) and to assess its impact on the quality of the blunt bream contaminated with P. fluorescens. The inhibition efficiency and photosensitization mechanism were investigated under different VK3 concentrations and UV-A light time conditions. The results showed that PDI could significantly inactivate P. fluorescens >7.0 log10 cfu/ml with 1 mM VK3 and 45 min of UV-A irradiation. Type I and type II photoresponses could co-occur in VK3-mediated PDI by quantitatively analyzing the photoresponse product ROS (OH, H2O2, 1O2). It was observed by SEM and TEM that the combined treatment of VK3 and UV-A disrupted the cellular integrity of P. fluorescens, leading to leakage of cell contents. Meanwhile, it degraded intracellular proteins and destroys genomic DNA, ultimately leading to bacterial death. In addition, the PDI system slowed down P. fluorescens' proliferation during the blunt bream storage at 4 °C. The PDI system effectively killed 59 % of P. fluorescens on the blunt bream fillets under 1.5 mM VK3 and 60 min of UV-A irradiation. The VK3-mediated PDI delayed pH change and TVB-N production, inhibited protein degradation and fat oxidation, and ultimately maintained the quality of fish fillets. This study provides a promising PDI system for controlling food microbial contamination and maintaining the storage quality of aquatic products.",

This report discusses two cases of CAE presenting as acute coronary syndrome. A 36-year-old man had proximal blockage in the left circumflex artery (LCx) and ectasia in the obtuse marginal artery and left anterior descending artery (LAD), while a 53-year-old male smoker had an ectatic LAD with a substantial thrombus. Both were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), specifically apixaban, along with atorvastatin. The first patient had complete resolution of LCx occlusion after 1 year, and the second patient had complete thrombus dissolution in the LAD in 2 months. These cases highlight the potential benefits of NOACs in managing CAE in acute coronary syndrome, suggesting that triple therapy can significantly improve clinical outcomes."

METHODS: A systematic computerized search of databases including PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov . was performed to gather research on the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin in the treatment of DVT, encompassing all records from the inception of each database through September 2024. The discrete data were presented as odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the meta-analysis was executed utilizing the Review Manager 5.4.1 and Stata 16 softwares. RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis of 16 studies encompassing 10,084 patients was conducted, with 6704 individuals in the experimental group receiving NOACs and 3380 in the control group treated with warfarin. The findings are as follows: (1) NOACs demonstrated enhanced treatment efficacy over warfarin, particularly in achieving vascular patency (OR = 1.57, 95% CI (1.09, 2.24), P = 0.01). (2) Regarding the incidence of major bleeding events (OR = 0.65, 95% CI (0.54, 0.78), P < 0.00001), other clinical adverse events-including pulmonary embolism, mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction and recurrent thrombosis (OR = 0.77, 95% CI (0.67, 0.88), P = 0.0002), and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) (OR = 0.62, 95% CI (0.47, 0.80), P = 0.0003); NOACs offered improved safety profiles in comparison to warfarin. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that the preventive efficacy of NOACs against PTS improves with longer follow-up periods (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: NOACs have demonstrated superior efficacy and safety profiles in the treatment of DVT compared to traditional warfarin anticoagulant therapy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This project did not involve any clinical data collection; the data utilized were derived from articles published in PubMed."

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of early initiation of NOACs with later initiation of NOACs in those patients, we conducted a meta-analysis of phase 3 or phase 4 randomized controlled trials. METHODS: We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase databases. A random effects model was selected to pool the effect measurement estimates (risk ratios [RRs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]). RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials with 6442 enrolled patients with AF and acute ischemic stroke were included. Compared with later NOAC therapy, early NOAC therapy was associated with nonsignificant reductions in the risk of primary outcomes (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65-1.05). Subgroup analysis found that in reducing risk of primary outcomes, early anticoagulation may benefit female patients more than male patients (0.54 [0.35-0.83] vs 0.97 [0.63-1.50]; P for interaction, .06). Numerically lower rates of recurrent ischemic stroke (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.15), death (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15), and systemic embolism (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16-1.11) were observed in early initiation of NOACs in comparison with later initiation of NOACs. There was no difference in major bleeding (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.55-1.74), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.43-1.96), or major extracranial bleeding (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.28-1.95) between groups. CONCLUSION: In AF patients with acute ischemic stroke, early initiation of NOACs is not inferior to later initiation of NOACs in reducing composite events, without increased hazard of bleeding, especially in female patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic stroke (HS) is associated with high risk of mortality or disability. To date, up to 25% of HSs are associated with anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. Early hemostatic therapy and correction of effect of antithrombotic drugs in patients with HS significantly reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. The latest international guidelines on this issue were presented almost 10 years ago. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In accordance with the PRISMA recommendations, we reviewed the PubMed, eLibrary and UpToDate databases and identified 137 articles. Of these, 52 were enrolled as the most relevant. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Regarding correction of the effect of indirect anticoagulants, various researchers discuss the possibility of either individual dosing or injection of a fixed dose of 4- or 3-factor prothrombin complex (1000-2000 IU regardless of body weight and international normalized ratio). To correct the effect of antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion and desmopressin are proposed. There is currently no evidence of safety and effectiveness of both methods in patients with HS. CONCLUSION: The optimal drug for correction of the effect of indirect anticoagulants is 4- or 3-factor prothrombin complex. In the last case, it is necessary to administer factor VIIa or fresh frozen plasma, as well as parenteral form of phytomenadione (vitamin K1) in all cases. The issue of correction of the effects of antiplatelet agents remains open. Regular analysis of available data with updating the guidelines for correction of the effect of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in HS is necessary.",

Clinical characteristics, recurrent arterial or VTE events, and hemorrhagic complications were analyzed over a one-year follow-up. RESULTS: Fifty APS patients were included: 31 (62%) treated with VKAs and 19 (38%) with DOACs. Thrombotic recurrences occurred in 5 VKA patients (16.1%) and 3 DOAC patients (15.8%). Major bleeding occurred in 2 VKA patients (6.45%) and none in the DOAC group. There were no significant differences in thrombotic recurrence (OR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.19-5.46) or major bleeding (OR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.14-8.52) between groups.

      "abstract": "Background. Alterations induced by direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to thromboelastometry and thrombin generation are not well defined. We performed a simultaneous investigation of thromboelastometry and thrombin generation for patients who were chronically anticoagulated with DOACs or VKAs. Methods. A total of 131 patients on DOACs [apixaban (n = 37), rivaroxaban (n = 34), dabigatran (n = 30), edoxaban (n = 30)] and 33 on VKAs were analyzed. Whole blood was analyzed for thromboelastometry and plasma was analyzed for thrombin generation. Results. While the thromboelastometry clotting time (CT) was responsive to the hypocoagulability induced by DOACs or VKAs, clot formation time and maximal clot formation were not. Cumulatively, the parameters denoting the velocity of thrombin generation (lag time, time-to-peak) were relatively less responsive to the hypocoagulability induced by VKAs than DOACs. Conversely, the parameters denoting the quantity of thrombin generation [peak-thrombin and the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP)] were more responsive to the hypocoagulability induced by VKAs than DOACs. Apixaban showed relatively small differences (peak vs. trough) in the plasma concentration and a relatively small (peak vs. trough) difference of hypocoagulability when assessed by the CT or the ETP. The CT and the ETP were strongly correlated with DOAC concentrations or with the VKA-INR. Conclusions. DOACs and VKAs altered thromboelastometry and thrombin generation to an extent that probably reflects the mode of action of these drugs and may also have practical implications for patients' management. Apixaban showed a small difference of hypocoagulability (peak vs. trough), suggesting a more stable anticoagulation over the daily course of treatment. Based on the correlations of the CT or the ETP vs. the DOAC concentrations, we estimated that critical values of the CT or the ETP would correspond to DOAC concentrations of 400 or 20 ng/mL. Whenever dedicated tests for DOAC concentrations are not available, the CT or the ETP can be used as surrogates to evaluate the level of anticoagulation induced by DOACs."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between an inverse proxy of functional vitamin K status, plasma dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), and cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVDRFs). METHODS: In a cross-sectional population-based health examination study of 4,092 individuals aged 24-77 years, the vitamin K status was assessed using plasma dp-ucMGP. All participants were linked to Danish National Prescription Register to obtain information on the use of vitamin K antagonists. The associations between log2 transformed dp-ucMGP values and CVDRFs were determined using regression models adjusted for sex, age, lifestyle factors, kidney function and waist circumference. RESULTS: Higher dp-ucMGP levels were associated with increased risk of central obesity (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.76, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 3.57-6.34), diabetes (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.11-3.45), hyperlipidaemia (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.01-2.03), and impaired kidney function (OR 9.83, 95% CI 5.49-17.59) per doubling in dp-ucMGP. Dp-ucMGP was not independently associated with hypertension or arterial stiffness. CONCLUSION: Higher dp-ucMGP levels were associated with central obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and impaired kidney function. Prospective studies and intervention studies examining the effects of improving vitamin K status are needed to clarify the potential role of vitamin K in relation to these CVDRFs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of antithrombotic agents typically use separate time-to-event analyses for bleeding and ischemic events, but this framework has limitations. Days alive and out of hospital (DAOH) is an alternative that may provide additional insight. We assessed the utility of DAOH as a clinical trial endpoint among patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention METHODS: AUGUSTUS, a randomized clinical trial, compared apixaban with warfarin and aspirin with placebo in 4614 patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. We used Poisson regression with a robust variance estimate to compare DAOH by treatment group. RESULTS: Mean (SD) DAOH was 168 (31); median (IQR) was 177 (169-180); 75% of patients neither died nor were hospitalized. Mean (SD) DAOH was 169 (28) with apixaban + placebo, 168 (29) with apixaban + aspirin, 168 (33) with warfarin + placebo, and 167 (33) with warfarin + aspirin. There were no significant differences in the rate ratio for DAOH for apixaban vs. warfarin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.01) or aspirin vs. placebo (RR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.01). Compared with warfarin, apixaban increased the proportion of patients who neither died nor were hospitalized during follow-up (76.8 vs. 73.3%; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95). CONCLUSION: In this analysis of AUGUSTUS, there was no difference in DAOH by treatment arm. These findings contrast with time-to-event analyses, which showed lower rates of major bleeding and hospitalization with apixaban and placebo. DAOH may not be very a useful measure of effects of antithrombotic therapies in this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02415400; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02415400.",

This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) vs vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in managing left ventricular thrombus among patients with and without recent myocardial infarction. METHODS: This retrospective observational study used data from the TriNetX research network. Patients with left ventricular thrombus treated with either DOACs or VKAs between December 1, 2013 and December 1, 2023, were included. Subgroup analyses were conducted for patients with or without recent acute coronary syndrome (<1 month). Risk and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were conducted at 90 days after the indexed event. RESULTS: A total of 39,770 patients were included. DOACs treatment had lower rates of stroke (11.8% vs 13.7%; relative risk [RR] 0.859; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.816-0.905; P < .001), major bleeding (4.8% vs 5.3%; RR 0.902; 95% CI, 0.829-0.982; P = .018), and systemic embolism (3.5% vs 4.2%; RR 0.841; 95% CI, 0.762-0.928; P = .001) compared with VKAs in overall cohort. Within the acute coronary syndrome group (n = 14,302), DOACs had lower stroke (12.3% vs 14.4%, RR 0.860; 95% CI, 0.791-0.935; P < .0001) and systemic embolism (3.1% vs 4%; RR 0.774; 95% CI, 0.651-0.919; P = .003) risks. For non-acute coronary syndrome group (n = 24,162), DOACs had lower stroke (11.4% vs 13.1%; RR 0.868; 95% CI, 0.811-0.929; P < .001) and major bleeding (4.8% vs 5.5%; RR 0.877; 95% CI, 0.787-0.977; P = .017) risks. No significant differences in all-cause mortality were observed across groups. CONCLUSION: DOACs demonstrated better safety and efficacy outcomes when compared with VKAs in left ventricular thrombus treatment, with or without recent acute coronary syndrome.",

This study aimed to analyze the consequences of poor anticoagulation control with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in Spanish patients with NVAF, focusing on thrombotic events, bleeding, mortality, healthcare resources (HRU), and costs. Methods: This observational, retrospective study used electronic medical records (BIG-PAC® database) of NVAF patients who started VKA treatment between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018. Patients were followed up for two years and classified by poor or adequate anticoagulation control. Demographic and clinical characteristics, treatments, incidence of cardiovascular events, mortality rates, HRU, and costs were analyzed. Results: Patients with poor control (n = 2136) had a 75% greater probability of suffering a cardiovascular event compared to patients with adequate control (n = 2351) (HR, 1.75 [95%CI: 1.43-2.14; p < 0.001]). Cardiovascular events, major bleeding, minor bleeding, systemic thromboembolism, and ischemic strokes were reduced by 32.1%, 46.2%, 29.6%, 22.2%, and 16.1%, respectively. It was estimated that adequate anticoagulant control saved EUR 455/patient with NAVF due to reduced hospitalization for cardiovascular events. Conclusions: For VKA-treated NVAF patients, poor anticoagulation control was associated with a higher number of cardiovascular events, greater consumption of HRU, and higher management costs than for patients with adequate control."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is linked to a high rate of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Rapid reversal can reduce ICH progression and mortality, but its effectiveness depends on the time between bleeding onset and coagulation normalization. OBJECTIVE: The PREVACT study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of prompt systematic reversal of anticoagulation in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) for recent mild-TBI while receiving a VKA. INTERVENTION: A randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint clinical trial was conducted in 21 French EDs. Patients receiving a VKA, having experienced a TBI within the last 6 h, and presenting a Glasgow Coma Score ≥13 were included. Patients were randomized to systematic immediate VKA reversal with 25 IU/kg of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4f-PCC) before any investigation (intervention group) or standard-of-care signifying reversal only if the initial cranial computed tomography (CT) scan indicated ICH (control group). The primary outcome was the rate of ICH detected on a cranial CT scan 24 h post-inclusion. RESULTS: The study was prematurely stopped for logistic reasons after the randomization of 202 patients (101 and 101 in the intervention and control groups, respectively, mean age 90; 51.8% female). On the 24-h cranial CT scan, 6 of 98 patients (6.1%) in the intervention group manifested ICH vs. 12 of 99 patients (12.1%) in the control group [odds ratio: 0.47 (95% confidence interval: 0.14-1.44); P = 0.215]. CONCLUSION: In patients with recent mild-TBI receiving a VKA, systematic prompt reversal with 4f-PCC did not statistically significantly reduce ICH rate at 24 h. However, the study was prematurely stopped and does not exclude a clinically relevant benefit of the strategy tested. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01961804)."

      "abstract": "Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors deficiency (VKCFD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by impaired levels of multiple coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X) and natural anticoagulants (proteins C and S). VKCFD is part of familial multiple coagulation factor deficiencies, reporting overall 50 affected families thus far. Disease manifestations are quite heterogeneous, bleeding symptoms may vary, and even, although generally mild, some patients may succumb to fatal outcomes. VKCFD diagnosis may be delayed because the disease phenotype simulates the most frequently acquired deficiencies of vitamin K. First-line coagulation assays, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), are both prolonged; mixing test typically normalizes the clotting times; and vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors will be variably decreased. Molecularly, VKCFD is associated with mutations in γ-glutamyl-carboxylase (GGCX) or vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) genes. Vitamin K is involved not only in the biosynthesis of coagulation proteins but also in bone metabolism and cell proliferation. Therapeutic options are based on vitamin K supplementation, coagulation factors (prothrombin complex), and fresh frozen plasma, in case of severe bleeding episodes. Two case studies here illustrate the diagnostic challenges of VKCFD: case 1 depicts a woman with a history of bleeding episodes, diagnosed, only in her third decade of life with inherited homozygous GGCX gene mutation. Case 2 shows a man with an acquired vitamin K deficiency caused by Crohn's disease. Better understanding of GGCX and VKORC1 mutations aids in prognosis and treatment planning, with emerging insights suggesting potential limitations in the effectiveness of vitamin K supplementation in certain mutations.",

In this work, we show that a pro-oxidant vitamin K precursor [menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)] suppresses PC progression in mice, killing cells through an oxidative cell death: MSB antagonizes the essential class III phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase VPS34-the regulator of endosome identity and sorting-through oxidation of key cysteines, pointing to a redox checkpoint in sorting. Testing MSB in a myotubular myopathy model that is driven by loss of MTM1-the phosphatase antagonist of VPS34-we show that dietary MSB improved muscle histology and function and extended life span. These findings enhance our understanding of pro-oxidant selectivity and show how definition of the pathways they impinge on can give rise to unexpected therapeutic opportunities.",

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on VKA treatment control in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study using the Clalit Health Services database. The cohort included patients who underwent either aortic or mitral valve replacement using a prosthetic mechanical valve. The primary outcomes included the overall time in therapeutic range (TTR) and the percent of patients with a TTR < 50% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to preceding year. RESULTS: The cohort included 2381 patients. The percentage of patients who had at least two international normalized ratio (INR) tests during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly lower compared to the year preceding the pandemic (81% and 87%, respectively, P < 0.001). In both years, the percentage of patients without any documented INR test was high (31.5% in the first COVID-19 pandemic year and 28.9% in the preceding year, P < 0.001). TTR was significantly lower during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the preceding year (68.1% ± 26 and 69.4% ± 24, P = 0.03). A TTR > 50% was demonstrated in 78% and 81% during the pandemic and the preceding year, P = 0.009. CONCLUSIONS: We noted overall poor VKA control in patients with mechanical heart valves. During the COVID-19 pandemic, VKA control became even worse as reflected by significantly lower TTR and INR tests rates.",

This review aimed to furnish clinicians with the latest clinical outcomes associated with apixaban and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in managing AF patients on dialysis. METHODS: Literature from the PubMed and Embase databases up to March 2024 underwent systematic scrutiny for inclusion. The results were narratively summarized. RESULTS: Six studies were included in this review, comprising the AXADIA-AFNET 8 study, the RENAL-AF trial, and four observational studies. In a French nationwide observational study, patients initiated on apixaban demonstrated a diminished risk of thromboembolic events (hazard ratios [HR]: 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-0.78) compared to those on VKAs. A retrospective review with a 2-year follow-up, encompassing patients with AF and ESKD on hemodialysis, evidenced no statistical difference in the risk of symptomatic bleeding and stroke between the apixaban and warfarin groups. Two retrospective studies based on the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) database both indicated no statistical difference between apixaban and VKAs in the risk of thromboembolic events. One study reported that apixaban correlated with a reduced risk of major bleeding relative to warfarin (HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.87), while the other study suggested that apixaban was associated with a decreased risk of mortality compared to warfarin (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.92). The AXADIA-AFNET 8 study found no differences between apixaban and VKAs in safety or effectiveness outcomes for AF patients on dialysis. The RENAL-AF trial, however, was deemed inadequate for drawing conclusions due to its small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, the published studies generally support that apixaban exhibits non-inferior safety and effectiveness outcomes compared to VKAs for AF patients on dialysis."

Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial on critically ill adult patients treated with cefoperazone-sulbactam. Patients received systemic cefoperazone-sulbactam antibiotics of 1.5 to 2 g every 12 hours. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: the intervention group (Gp-I), who received a 10 mg intravenous dose of vitamin K every week until cefoperazone-sulbactam therapy ended, and the control group (Gp-C), who received only cefoperazone-sulbactam. Results: Our main finding was the significantly higher survival probability from coagulopathy in Gp-I than in Gp-C using the Kaplan-Myers curve (χ2 = 25.5, P < .001). The adjusted hazard ratios for coagulopathy obtained from the Cox regression analysis revealed that the intervention was significantly associated with a 99% reduction in the hazard of coagulopathy relative to Gp-C (HR = 0.01, P = .001). The Kaplan-Myers curve indicated a significantly higher survival probability from bleeding in Gp-I than in Gp-C (χ2 = 9, degree of freedom = 1, P = .005). Conclusion: In critically ill patients, intravenous prophylactic doses of vitamin K of 10 mg per week prevent cefoperazone-sulbactam-induced coagulopathy. Therefore, we recommend adding vitamin K supplementation to ICU protocols in Egypt for cefoperazone-sulbactam safety."

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) prevent thromboembolic events, but information about the quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction in relation with the anticoagulant treatment is limited. Methods: REGUEIFA is a prospective, observational, and multicentre study that included patients with AF treated by cardiologists. We included patients treated with VKAs or DOACs. The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire evaluated QoL, and the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS) questionnaire investigated patient satisfaction with OAC. Results: A total of 904 patients were included (532 on VKA and 372 on DOACs). A total of 846 patients completed the EQ-5D questionnaire, with results significantly worse in patients on VKAs than on DOACs: more mobility limitations (37.6% vs. 24.2%, p < 0.001), more restriction in usual activities (24.7% vs. 18.3%, p = 0.026), more pain/discomfort (31.8% vs. 24.2%, p = 0.015), a lower visual analogue scale (VAS) score (66.4 ± 16.21 vs. 70.8 ± 15.6), and a lower EQ-D5 index (0.79 ± 0.21 vs. 0.85 ± 0.2, p < 0.001). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, VKA treatment was not an independent factor towards worse EQ-5D results. Also, 738 patients completed the ACTS questionnaire, and burden and profit scores were lower in patients on VKAs than for DOACs (52.1 ± 8.4 vs. 55.5 ± 6.8, p < 0.001 and 11.1 ± 2.4 vs. 11.8 ± 2.6, p < 0.001, respectively). The negative impact score was higher for VKAs than for DOACs (1.8 ± 1.02 vs. 1.6 ± 0.99, p < 0.001), with a general positive impact score lower for VKAs than for DOACs (3.6 ± 0.96 vs. 3.8 ± 1.02, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients on VKA have more comorbidity and worse EQ-5D and VAS scores than those on DOACs. VKA has a greater burden and higher negative impact on the patient's life than DOACs."

      "abstract": "Objectives: The pathophysiology of osteoarthritis is mainly unknown. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) and Gla-rich protein (GRP) are both vitamin-K-dependent mineralization inhibitors. In this study, we aimed to compare the levels of MGP and GRP in the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic (OA) and non-osteoarthritic (non-OA) knee joints. Materials and Methods: Two groups were formed, with one consisting of patients with OA and the other non-OA, serving as a control group. The non-OA group included individuals who had arthroscopic surgery for non-cartilage-related issues. In the OA group, all participants had undergone total knee arthroplasty because of grade 4 primary degenerative osteoarthritis. During the operation, at least 1 mL of knee synovial fluid was collected. The GRP and MGP levels in the synovial fluid were measured using an ELISA kit. Results: The mean age in the OA group (62.03 ± 11.53 years) was significantly higher than that in the non-OA group (47.70 ± 14.49 years; p = 0.0001). GRP levels were significantly higher in the OA group (419.61 ± 70.14 ng/mL) compared to the non-OA group (382.18 ± 62.34 ng/mL; p = 0.037). MGP levels were significantly higher in the OA group (67.76 ± 11.36 ng/mL) compared to the non-OA group (53.49 ± 18.28 ng/mL; p = 0.001). Calcium levels (Ca++) were also significantly higher in the OA group (12.89 ± 3.43 mg/dL) compared to the non-OA group (9.51 ± 2.15 mg/dL; p = 0.0001). There was a significantly positive correlation between MGP levels and age (p = 0.011, R = +0.335). Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of age on MGP levels (p = 0.011, R-Square = 0.112). The dependent variable in this analysis was MGP (ng/mL), and age was the predictor. Conclusions: In conclusion, both GRP and MGP are potentially usable biomarkers in osteoarthritis. However, GRP seems to be more valuable because it is not associated with age. In the future, both proteins could provide important contributions to the diagnosis and treatment of osteoarthritis."

      "abstract": "Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have revolutionized anticoagulant therapy, offering improved safety and efficacy over traditional agents like warfarin. This review comprehensively examines the dual roles of NOACs-apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran-not only as anticoagulants, but also as modulators of inflammation via protease-activated receptor (PAR) signaling. We highlight the unique pharmacotherapeutic properties of each NOAC, supported by key clinical trials demonstrating their effectiveness in preventing thromboembolic events. Beyond their established anticoagulant roles, emerging research suggests that NOACs influence inflammation through PAR signaling pathways, implicating factors such as factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin in the modulation of inflammatory responses. This review synthesizes current evidence on the anti-inflammatory potential of NOACs, exploring their impact on inflammatory markers and conditions like atherosclerosis and diabetes. By delineating the mechanisms by which NOACs mediate anti-inflammatory effects, this work aims to expand their therapeutic utility, offering new perspectives for managing inflammatory diseases. Our findings underscore the broader clinical implications of NOACs, advocating for their consideration in therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing inflammation-related pathologies. This comprehensive synthesis not only enhances understanding of NOACs' multifaceted roles, but also paves the way for future research and clinical applications in inflammation and cardiovascular health.",

METHODS: We searched the PubMed, LILACS, and MEDLINE databases to retrieve, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NOACs and VKAs in patients with AF and type 2 VHD, excluding mitral stenosis (moderate to severe, of rheumatic origin) or mechanical heart valves. The efficacy outcomes assessed were stroke and systemic embolism (SE), while safety outcomes included major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). RESULTS: Seven RCTs, including 16,070 patients with AF and type 2 VHD, were included. NOACs reduced the risk of stroke/SE (relative risk [RR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.89; P = 0.0005), with no significant difference in major bleeding (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.64-1.21; P = 0.43). The risk of ICH was reduced with NOACs (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.77; P = 0.003). For patients with AF and bioprosthetic heart valve (five trials, 2805 patients), stroke/SE risks (RR, 0.65, 95% CI, 0.44-0.96) with NOACs were superior to VKAs. Major bleeding risks without ENVISAGE TAVI AF trial (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.94; P = 0.03) with NOACs were superior to VKAs. The risks of ICH (RR, 0.61; 95% CI 0.34-1.09; P = 0.09) with NOACs were comparable to VKAs. CONCLUSIONS: NOACs demonstrate efficacy and safety in patients with AF and type 2 VHD and reduce the risk of stroke/SE and ICH when compared with those with VKAs."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate FII/FIIE abnormalities among patients assessed for coagulopathies and identify findings predictive of coagulopathy improvement after VK. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed consecutive cases from 2002 to 2021 with FII/FIIE tests and the sensitivity and specificity of FII/FIIE ratios and FIIE-FII differences for VKD defined as international normalized ratio correction/improvement of ≥0.5 after VK. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-two patients (males, 58.2%; adults, 85.6%; median age, 73 years) were evaluated (84.2% hospitalized, 48.3% in intensive care, 71.6% with active liver disease, and 28% deceased at discharge) and 25% to 38% had FII/FIIE findings suggestive of VKD. Among 170 patients assessed for response to VK, FII/FIIE ratios of ≤0.84 to 0.91 and FIIE-FII differences of >0.04 U/mL had similar modest sensitivity (47.7%-69.3%) and modest to good specificity (67.1%-91.5%) for VKD. FII/FIIE ratios of <0.86, suggestive of VKD (sensitivity, 47.7%; specificity, 90.2%), were more common in patients deficient in only VKDF (P = .0001), but were detected in 16% with non-VKDF deficiencies. Low FIIE was commonly associated with active liver disease (P = .0002). Patients with and without probable VKD (based on FII/FIIE ratios of <0.86) had similar mortality, bleeding, and rates of prothrombin complex concentrate and red cell transfusions (P ≥ .78), but fewer with probable VKD received plasma and fibrinogen replacement (P ≤ .024). CONCLUSION: FII/FIIE comparison aids the diagnosis of VKD and predicts clinical responses to VK treatment among patients with coagulopathies.",

      "abstract": "It remains unclear whether non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are more effective and safer than warfarin in low-weight patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Here, we retrospectively compared the effectiveness and safety of NOACs with those of warfarin in low-weight patients with AF. We extracted the July 2011-September 2022 data of patients with AF treated with a NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) or warfarin at a tertiary hospital. The patients were divided into low-weight (body weight ≤ 60 kg) and non-low-weight (body weight = 60-100 kg) groups. The primary outcomes were hospitalization for ischemic stroke (IS) or systemic embolism (SE) and major bleeding, whereas the secondary outcomes were any ischemic and bleeding events. We used the inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance the baseline characteristics between the groups. In total, 5,044 patients (mean age = 73.7 years, mean CHA2DS2-VASc score = 3.0, mean HAS-BLED score = 2.3) were enrolled and divided into low-weight and non-low-weight groups-containing 1,666 (1,406 NOAC users, 260 warfarin users) and 3,378 (2,978 NOAC users, 400 warfarin users) patients, respectively. NOACs were associated with a lower risk of any bleeding event in the low-weight group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.61, 95% confidence interval = 0.51-0.73). The between-group differences in the risks of IS/SE, any ischemic event, major bleeding, and any bleeding event were nonsignificant. Thus, the use of NOACs (specifically dabigatran or edoxaban) is associated with a lower risk of any bleeding event than warfarin use in low-weight patients with AF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent among patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing dialysis, and both conditions are associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular diseases. Anticoagulation is essential for preventing thromboembolic complications in these patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of factor Xa inhibitors compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for AF patients on dialysis. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed and Embase databases was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to June 2024. Eligible studies compared factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) with VKAs in AF patients on dialysis, with primary outcomes of stroke or systemic embolism(SSE) and major bleeding. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies (3 randomized controlled trials and 4 observational cohorts) were included. For the RCTs, the use of factor Xa inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of SSE compared to VKAs (odds ratio [OR] = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.15-0.93). There was no significant difference in the risk of major bleeding events between the two groups (OR = 0.65, 95%CI:0.32-1.33). Observational cohort studies yielded similar results with a decreased risk of SSE (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74, 95%CI:0.57-0.96) and no significant difference in major bleeding (HR = 0.87, 95%CI:0.62-1.22). No differences in treatment effect between apixaban and rivaroxaban were observed for efficacy (p-interaction = 0.44) and safety (p-interaction = 0.21) outcomes. CONCLUSION: Factor Xa inhibitors, particularly apixaban and rivaroxaban, were associated with a lower risk of SEE without an increase in major bleeding, which might be convenient alternatives to VKAs in managing AF in patients with ESKD on dialysis.",

Herein, we describe a case in which a patient was found to have coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency when he was transferred to a hospital for treatment for a postoperative infection of the lumbar spine. The coagulation disorder was caused by antimicrobial agents administered to the patient, who was suffering from hyponutrition. The patient was a 70-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus. He was diagnosed with lumbar spinal canal stenosis and underwent posterior decompression of the L2-L5 and S1 laminae at a previous hospital five months before transfer to our hospital. Four months before transfer, purulent discharge was observed from the wound, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was detected in the wound culture. Cefazolin was administered for two weeks, resulting in initial improvement. However, one month before the transfer, the wound infection recurred, accompanied by bacteremia and a psoas abscess. He had been treated with cefazolin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole, but the antibiotics' effects were insufficient. Upon transfer for debridement surgery due to uncontrolled infection, his coagulation parameters were as follows: prothrombin time (PT) 74.0 sec, PT-international normalized ratio (INR) 6.69, PT% 9.0, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 138 sec, fibrinogen (FIB) 664 mg/dl, fibrin degradation products (FDP) 7.1 μg/ml, and protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) 34400 mAU/ml. Because we suspected vitamin K deficiency, vitamin K 40 mg was administered as a test dose, and coagulation function improved to PT 16.4 sec, PT-INR 1.30, PT% 65.2, and APTT 79 sec after four hours. The diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency was confirmed, vitamin K was administered for four days, and the coagulation status normalized five days after transfer. Debridement was performed for the left psoas abscess. Cefazolin was administered for eight weeks, and administration was completed. The coagulation abnormality did not recur due to careful attention to his nutrition. We experienced a case of coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency caused by antimicrobial agents administered to a hyponourished patient with a postoperative infection of the lumbar spine. The cause of vitamin K deficiency, in this case, was thought to be low nutrition, suppression of vitamin K-producing bacteria by cefazolin and rifampicin, and the use of cefazolin with a methyl-thiadiazole thiol group. It should be kept in mind that severe coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency caused by antimicrobial treatment with hyponutrition can occur in postoperative infections."

AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of vitamin-K antagonist (VKA) versus dual antiplatelet (DAPT) therapy in management of patients with isolated and non-obstructive atherosclerotic CAE. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 79 patients diagnosed on elective coronary angiography to have either isolated CAE or non-obstructive atherosclerotic CAE. Patients were assigned in 1:1 pattern to receive either VKA (warfarin) or DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel). Patients were followed-up for nine-months. The primary endpoint was the cumulative events rate including acute coronary event, target vessel intervention, or cardiac death. Analysis of cumulative events at different time intervals, its individual components, and bleeding were considered secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Cumulative events rate was 33%, with mortality rate of 2.5%. Both treatment groups showed comparable cumulative events during the nine-months follow-up duration. Nevertheless, Kaplan-Meier analysis beyond the first 3-months of follow-up showed significantly higher event-free survival among the VKA-group. Recurrent events (≥2) were significantly higher among the DAPT-group. Both groups showed no major bleeding events. Multivariable cox-regression analysis showed that presence of significant coronary tortuosity, use of DAPT in reference to VKA, and lower percent time in therapeutic range (%TTR) among those receiving VKA were significant independent predictors of clinical adverse events beyond the first 3-months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Cumulative adverse events were comparable among both treatment groups for isolated non-obstructive CAE. However, adverse events were significantly more frequent in the DAPT-group beyond the first three months.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Millions of people take vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Some people who need urgent surgical procedures require rapid VKA reversal to prevent excessive intraoperative bleeding. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hemostatic noninferiority of an investigational 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) to a control 4F-PCC for rapid VKA reversal before urgent surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 3, double-blind, noninferiority randomized clinical trial (LEX-209) was conducted in 24 hospitals in the US, Russia, Georgia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Romania from June 7, 2017, through November 8, 2021; the study was stopped in February 2022. Participants were adult patients taking VKA who had an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 or higher and needed urgent surgery with a substantial bleeding risk (≥50 mL). Patients were randomized 1:1 to a single infusion of either the investigational 4F-PCC or the control 4F-PCC. Data analysis followed intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches. INTERVENTIONS: Single intravenous infusion was dosed by body weight and baseline INR. A dose of 25, 35, or 50 IU/kg of investigational 4F-PCC or control 4F-PCC was administered for baseline INR of 2 to less than 4, 4 to 6, or over 6, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary end point was hemostatic efficacy at surgery end. An independent adjudication board, blinded to the 4F-PCC treatment allocation, assessed hemostatic efficacy using an objective 4-point scale. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients (median [range] age, 67.5 [31-92] years; 118 males [56.7%]) received the investigational (n = 105) or the control (n = 103) 4F-PCC. The median (range) dose was 25 (16-50) IU/kg in the investigational group and 25 (15-50) IU/kg in the control group, with a median (range) infusion time of 12 (8-50) minutes and 13 (7-30) minutes and a median (range) time from infusion to surgery start of 1.42 (0.25-15.25) hours and 1.50 (0.42-18.50) hours, respectively. Baseline median (range) INR was 3.05 (1.97-21.10) in the investigational group and 3.00 (2.00-11.30) in the control group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the investigational 4F-PCC was noninferior to the control 4F-PCC, resulting in effective hemostasis in 94.3% of patients vs 94.2% of patients (proportion difference, 0.001; 95% CI, -0.080 to 0.082; P < .001), meeting the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.15. An INR of 1.5 or lower at 30 minutes after infusion occurred in 78.1% of patients in the investigational group vs 71.8% of patients in the control group (proportion difference, 0.063; 95% CI, -0.056 to 0.181). Thrombotic events (2.9% vs 0%, respectively) and mortality (4.8% vs 1.0%, respectively) were no different than expected for 4F-PCC use. One patient in each treatment group discontinued due to adverse events (cardiac disorders unrelated to 4F-PCC). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that the investigational 4F-PCC was hemostatically noninferior to the control 4F-PCC for rapid VKA reversal in patients needing urgent surgery with considerable bleeding risk; the safety profile of these two 4F-PCCs was similar. These results support the investigational 4F-PCC as a therapeutic option for surgical patients requiring rapid VKA reversal. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02740335.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DOACs compared with VKAs therapy in patients with LVT. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were systematically searched for randomized clinical trials or cohort studies that compared DOACs versus VKAs for LVT. Risk ratios (RRs) were computed for binary endpoints, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Statistical significance was defined as p value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 4 randomized clinical trials and 29 cohort studies were included, with 4,450 patients assigned to either DOACs or VKAs. There was no significant difference between groups for stroke or systemic embolic (SSE) events (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07; p = 0.157), stroke (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.11; p = 0.140), systemic embolic (SE) events (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.17; p = 0.166), thrombus resolution (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.11; p = 0.077), any bleeding (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00; p = 0.054), clinically relevant bleeding (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.03; p = 0.066), minor bleeding (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.23; p = 0.234), major bleeding (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.80; p = 0.705), and all-cause mortality (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.39; p = 0.752). Compared with VKAs, rivaroxaban significantly reduced SSE events (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91; p = 0.029) and SE events (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.95; p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: DOACs had a similar rate of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events, as well as thrombus resolution, compared to VKAs in the treatment of LVTs. Rivaroxaban therapy had a significant reduction in thromboembolic events, compared to VKAs.",

It has been suggested that prolonged use of VKAs can increase the development of vascular and valvular calcification, though this effect has not been examined in larger randomized prospective trials. This investigator-initiated multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label interventional trial randomized patients with baseline coronary or valvular calcification and an indication for prolonged oral anticoagulation therapy to Marcumar or Rivaroxaban. Patients were followed-up through repeat coronary computed tomographies to measure the progression of coronary and valvular calcification for up to 24 months. 192 patients were randomized between 2013 and 2018 to receive either Rivaroxaban or Marcumar and followed for up to 24 months. Coronary calcification significantly increased over time although there was no significant difference in progression between the groups after 12 and 24 months as measured by the Agatston score [360.7 (90.2; 1075.3) vs 380.4 (136.4; 1546.9) p = 0.69], the volume score [295.8 (93.0; 995.3) vs 335.5 (128.7; 1316.9) p = 0.95] and the mass score [58.5 (15.9; 172.0) vs 71.1 (24.8; 257.3) p = 0.5]. Dephosphorylated, uncarboxylated matrix Gla Protein (Dp-ucMGP) significantly decreased in the VKA group [Δ dp-uc MGP - 95.2 (- 554.1; 156.0) vs 231.3 (- 59.7; 388.1) p < 0.001]. There does not appear to be a relevant effect of vitamin K inhibition by the vitamin K antagonist marcumar upon coronary calcification.",

The impact of NOACs on chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) remains controversial. This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effectiveness and safety of NOACs compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with CTEPH. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library was conducted for relevant studies, encompassing data from inception until November 2023. The data were pooled using a fixed-effects model if the I2 value was less than 50%; otherwise, a random-effects model was employed. Overall, two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight observational studies involving 4556 patients with CTEPH were included. Patients receiving NOACs exhibited a significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.76) and major bleeding (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36-0.92) compared to those with VKAs. There were no significant differences in the rate of VTE recurrence (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.72-1.59), total bleeding (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.60-1.01), and minor bleeding (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.73-1.69) between the two studied groups. Similar results were found in the subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis.This meta-analysis provided evidence that NOACs could be superior to VKAs for the treatment of CTEPH. NOACs might be safe and a convenient alternative to VKAs for thromboprophylaxis in patients with CTEPH.",

These biological properties are also necessary for maintaining domesticated animal health. The synergistic impact of both VK and vitamin D (VD) maximizes these health benefits, specifically for the circulatory and skeletal systems. This manuscript reviews VK's properties, molecular structures, nutrikinetics, mechanisms of action, daily requirements, safety in supplemental form, biomarkers used for its detection, and impacts on various organs. The purpose of synthesizing this information is to evaluate the potential uses of VK for the treatment or prevention of diseases."

Selection of anticoagulants, duration of anticoagulation, decision of adjuvant therapy, and adjustment of the regimen in special situations are the major problems that need to be considered in the treatment of cancer-associated PE. Current first line treatment in long-term therapy following an episode of PE is low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) listed as viable alternatives. This study aims to explore long-term oral anticoagulation therapy for cancer patients.

Despite the limitations of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) drugs, it continues to be the recommended oral anticoagulation for LVT. Recently, nonvitamin K oral antagonist (NOAC) has gained popularity as an off-labeled treatment for systemic embolism prevention in LVT. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to compare the outcomes (stroke and bleeding) of warfarin versus NOAC therapy in patients with LVT. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compares NOAC and VKA therapy in LVT patients. We enrolled 201 patients with an echocardiography-confirmed LVT from January 2018 to December 2022. Patients who received NOAC therapy (NOAC, n = 77) were compared to VKA patients (VKA, n = 124). The primary endpoint was a composite of stroke, minor and major bleeding. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 17 months (25th-75th percentiles: 8-38). On unmatched analysis, both groups had no difference in major bleeding (log-rank, P = 0.61) and stroke (log-rank, P = 0.77). However, all bleeding events were higher with NOAC (log-rank, P = 0.01). On matched analysis, there was no difference between both groups in the overall bleeding events (P = 0.08), major bleeding (P = 0.57), and stroke (P = 0.66). Minor bleeding was significantly lower in the VKA group (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: In patients with LVT, NOAC was as effective as VKA in stroke prevention without increasing the risk of major bleeding."

This has led to uncertainty regarding the optimal anticoagulant therapy in this population at high risk of thromboembolic events. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety of DOACs versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation and liver cirrhosis. Databases including Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies. The primary effectiveness outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, and the safety outcome was major bleeding events. A total of 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to VKAs, the use of DOACs was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.92, p=0.005). The risk of all-cause mortality was comparable between the two groups (RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.74-1.07, p=0.23). Notably, DOACs demonstrated a significantly lower risk of major bleeding events (RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.61-0.73, p<0.01) compared to VKAs. This meta-analysis suggests that DOACs may be a favorable alternative to VKAs for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation and liver cirrhosis, with a lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding. However, further research is needed to establish optimal dosing strategies and assess the safety and efficacy of DOACs in patients with advanced liver disease."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after surgical mitral valve repair (MVR) or bioprosthetic valve replacement (BVR) in mitral position remains a controversial topic among the cardiovascular community, in particular in the early postoperative period. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs in the first three months after MVR or mitral BVR compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study with prospectively collected peri-intervention outcomes between 2020 and 2021. Records were retrieved and all participants were contacted by telephone. Patients were divided into groups according to OAC strategy. The primary outcome was a composite of death, rehospitalization, myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, mitral thrombosis, or bleeding during the first three months after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 65.5±12.2 years, 56.8% male. On discharge, 98 (66.2%) patients were on VKAs and 50 (33.8%) were on DOACs for at least three months. The primary outcome occurred in 22 (22.4%) patients in the VKA group and in three (6%) in the NOAC group (p=0.012), mainly driven by more bleeding events in the former. Independent predictors of the primary outcome were smoking (p=0.028) and OAC with VKAs at discharge, the latter predicting three times more events (p=0.046, OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.02-13.5). CONCLUSIONS: NOACs were associated with fewer events, supporting their efficacy and safety during the first three months after surgical MVR or mitral BVR.",

OBJECTIVES: XARENO (Factor XA-inhibition in RENal patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation Observational registry; NCT02663076) is a prospective observational study comparing adverse kidney outcomes in patients with AF and advanced chronic kidney disease receiving rivaroxaban or VKA. METHODS: Patients with AF and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included. Blinded adjudicated outcome analysis evaluated adverse kidney outcomes (a composite of eGFR decline to <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, need for chronic kidney replacement therapy, or development of acute kidney injury). A composite net clinical benefit outcome (stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, or cardiovascular death) was also analyzed. HRs with 95% CIs were calculated using propensity score overlap weighting Cox regression. RESULTS: There were 1,455 patients (764 rivaroxaban; 691 VKA; mean age 78 years; 44% females). The mean eGFR was 37.1 ± 9.0 in those receiving rivaroxaban and 36.4 ± 10.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in those receiving VKA. After a median follow-up of 2.1 years, rivaroxaban was associated with less adverse kidney outcomes (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.43-0.88) and all-cause death (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.98). No significant differences were observed in net clinical benefit. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AF and advanced chronic kidney disease, those receiving rivaroxaban had less adverse kidney events and lower all-cause mortality compared to those receiving VKA, supporting the use of rivaroxaban in this high-risk group of patients."

Traditional therapy involves Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs), but Newer Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) offer potential advantages. This study addresses a crucial knowledge gap in the Indian context, analyzing real-world data to guide CVT management decisions. METHODS: A single-center, ambispective cohort study included consecutive adult CVT patients. Data collection encompassed demographics, clinical data, imaging, and treatment details. Patients were categorized into VKA and NOAC groups. Outcomes measured recanalization status, functional outcomes, bleeding events, and adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: Among 181 enrolled patients, NOAC-treated (Group B) individuals had significantly higher rates of complete recanalization (58.5% vs. 31.1%) with a similar incidence of adverse events and also displayed better functional outcomes at weeks 8 and 12 compared to VKA-treated (Group A) patients. Recurrent thromboembolic events were absent in both groups during follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study highlights NOACs' potential advantages in CVT management, including improved functional outcomes, enhanced recanalization, and similar bleeding risk. Adverse events were milder with NOACs. While acknowledging limitations, these findings support NOACs as a promising alternative to VKAs, advancing CVT care and outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a widespread and significant cause of morbidity and mortality on a global scale. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study is to examine the impact of anticoagulant therapy on major organ hemorrhage events in patients diagnosed with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). Specifically, this research compares the effects of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study examined the medical records of 46 patients who had been diagnosed with VTE and were receiving treatment with DOACs or VKAs. The documentation of patient characteristics encompassed demographic information, comorbidities, and treatment particulars. Within 30 days of hospital admission, the incidence of significant organ bleeding events, with an emphasis on gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage, was the primary outcome evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 46 patients with VTE who were treated with oral anticoagulation therapy participated in the study. Twenty-four and 22 patients were administered VKAs and DOACs, respectively. The similarity in baseline characteristics between the DOAC and VKA groups ensured that the analyses were well-matched. The examination of bleeding sites unveiled subtle variations, as the DOAC group exhibited a progressive increase in the incidence of intracranial bleeding (12, 55.5%), while the VKA group demonstrated a surge in upper gastrointestinal bleeding (12, 50%) as well. While lacking statistical significance, these observed patterns are consistent with prior research that indicates that DOACs may have a lower risk of catastrophic hemorrhage in comparison to VKAs. The overall in-hospital mortality rate for patients treated with VKA was 33.3% (n=8), while that treated with DOAC was 18.2% (n=4). These differences did not reach statistical significance (P>0.05). In a similar vein, the evaluation of mortality associated with hemorrhage revealed six (25%) in the group receiving VKA and three (13.6%) in the group receiving DOAC; the P value was not statistically significant (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes valuable insights into bleeding outcomes associated with anticoagulant therapy for acute VTE. The nuanced differences in bleeding patterns highlight the complexity of anticoagulant selection, emphasizing the importance of considering bleeding site considerations. The comparable mortality rates support existing evidence regarding the favorable safety profile of DOACs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in comparison with warfarin using data from real practice based on the perspective of the health care system in Thailand. METHODS: A four-state Markov model encompassing well-controlled atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke and systemic embolism, major bleeding and death was utilised to forecast clinical and economic outcomes. Transitional probabilities, direct medical costs and utilities were derived from the real-world data of the 'COOL-AF Thailand' registry, Thailand's largest nationwide registry spanning 27 hospitals. The cohort comprised AF patients. The primary outcomes assessed were total costs, life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. All costs and outcomes were subject to an annual discount rate of 3.0%. A spectrum of sensitivity analyses was conducted. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 68.8 ± 10.7 years. The NOACs group incurred a marginally lower total lifetime cost than the warfarin group (247,857 Thai baht [THB] vs 253,654 THB or 7137 USD vs 7304 USD) and experienced gains of 0.045 life years and 0.043 QALYs over the warfarin group. Given the lower cost and higher benefits associated with NOACs, this implies that NOAC treatment is a dominant strategy compared to warfarin for AF patients. At a ceiling ratio of 160,000 THB (4607 USD) per QALY, NOACs presented a 61.2% probability of being cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants represent a cost-saving alternative to warfarin in the real clinical practice. However, with a probability of being cost effective below 65%, it suggests some parameter uncertainty regarding their overall cost effectiveness compared to warfarin.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Long-term oral anticoagulation is the primary therapy for preventing ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Different types of oral anticoagulant drugs can have specific effects on the metabolism of patients. Here we characterize, for the first time, the serum metabolomic and lipoproteomic profiles of AF patients treated with anticoagulants: vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples of 167 AF patients (median age 78 years, 62 % males, 70 % on DOACs treatment) were analyzed via high resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Data on 25 metabolites and 112 lipoprotein-related fractions were quantified and analyzed with multivariate and univariate statistical approaches. KEY FINDINGS: Our data provide evidence that patients treated with VKAs and DOACs present significant differences in their profiles: lower levels of alanine and lactate (odds ratio: 1.72 and 1.84), free cholesterol VLDL-4 subfraction (OR: 1.75), triglycerides LDL-1 subfraction (OR: 1.80) and 4 IDL cholesterol fractions (ORs ∼ 1.80), as well as higher levels of HDL cholesterol (OR: 0.48), apolipoprotein A1 (OR: 0.42) and 7 HDL cholesterol fractions/subfractions (ORs: 0.40-0.51) are characteristic of serum profile of patients on DOACs' therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support the usefulness of NMR-based metabolomics for the description of the effects of oral anticoagulants on AF patient circulating metabolites and lipoproteins. The higher serum levels of HDL cholesterol observed in patients on DOACs could contribute to explaining their reduced cardiovascular risk, suggesting the need of further studies in this direction to fully understand possible clinical implications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Warfarin is an effective anticoagulant but requires close International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring and may occasionally require correction of excessive anticoagulation. Current guidelines provide limited practical guidance on the administration of vitamin K for the management of supratherapeutic INR levels ≥ 5.0 in non-bleeding outpatients. OBJECTIVES: Based on expert consensus and guidelines, the Atrius Health Anticoagulation Management Services (AMS) has developed internal guidance for oral vitamin K use in highly selected populations. This study will describe the internal guidance for oral vitamin K use and present associated results and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Episodes with INR > 5.0 were included, with vitamin K considered for episodes with INR ≥ 6. Moreover, compelling indications and exclusions to select ideal patients for vitamin K intervention were also defined. RESULTS: Overall, episodes were managed conservatively; of the 246 collected episodes of excessive anticoagulation, in 18 episodes (7%), patients received vitamin K, and in 228 (93%) episodes, patients did not receive vitamin K. The mean index INR was 6.0 (range 5.0 - 10.5, SD 1.07), with nearly 57% of episodes achieving INR correction and 15% of episodes developing INR overcorrection. High thrombotic risk patients, regardless of hemorrhagic risk, were less likely to receive vitamin K. Three episodes (1.2%) resulted in bleeding complications. No thrombotic complications occurred during the 30-day follow-up of the index INR value ≥ 5.0. CONCLUSION: Our internal guidance is a novel, standardized approach that serves as a decision support tool for the management of warfarin-associated coagulopathy and vitamin K intervention using patient-specific characteristics and index INR values. This guidance may assist other anticoagulation management services with practical applications and require validation in a prospective clinical trial.",

      "abstract": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a subtype of pulmonary hypertension characterized by organized thrombi inside the pulmonary vasculature, leading to an increase in pulmonary artery pressure. CTEPH is seen in about 3-4% of patients with acute pulmonary embolism and is associated with poor outcomes. Apart from surgical intervention, lifelong anticoagulation is the mainstay of CTEPH management. Traditionally, CTEPH is managed with vitamin-K antagonists (VKA); however, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recently gaining popularity. However, the current literature comparing DOACs versus VKAs in CTEPH has inconsistent results. An electronic search of the major bibliographic databases was performed to retrieve studies comparing DOACs versus VKAs in CTEPH patients. For dichotomous outcomes, the odds ratio (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model to generate forest plots. Statistical significance was considered at P < 0.05. Ten studies were included with 3936 patients (1269 in the DOAC group and 2667 in the VKA group). Treatment with DOAC was associated with no statistically significant difference in the risk of all-cause mortality (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.35-1.71; P < 0.53), venous thromboembolism (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.59-2.40; P = 0.63), major bleeding (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.38-1.22; P = 0.20), and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.80-1.86; P = 0.37). Our analysis demonstrates that DOACs are noninferior to VKAs in terms of their safety and outcomes profile in CTEPH. Further trials are needed to evaluate more robust evidence and to compare additional outcomes."

However, there is limited real-world data for Japanese VTE patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The KUROSIO study (UMIN000023747) was a prospective long-term observational study comprising 1,017 patients with concurrent acute symptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism and proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or isolated calf DVT initially treated with DOACs. After excluding 24 patients, 993 (mean age, 66.3±15.1 years; 58.6% females) were analyzed. The incidences of recurrent symptomatic VTE and major bleeding for up to 52 weeks after diagnosis were 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed chemotherapy and anemia as significant risk factors associated with recurrent symptomatic VTE and major bleeding, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of DOACs in Japanese patients with VTE were determined in this real-world observational study.",

      "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) accounts for 40% of all cardiac arrhythmias and is associated with a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolic complications. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) that have been proven to prevent stroke in patients with non-valvular AF. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug interactions of DOACs, as well as new data from pharmacogenetic studies of these drugs. This review is aimed at analyzing the scientific literature on the gene polymorphisms involved in the metabolism of DOACs. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and CyberLeninka (Russian version) databases with keywords: 'dabigatran', 'apixaban', 'rivaroxaban', 'edoxaban', 'gene polymorphism', 'pharmacogenetics', 'ABCB1', 'CES1', 'SULT1A', 'ABCG2', and 'CYP3A4'. The articles referred for this review include (1) full-text articles; (2) study design with meta-analysis, an observational study in patients taking DOAC; and (3) data on the single-nucleotide polymorphisms and kinetic parameters of DOACs (plasma concentration), or a particular clinical outcome, published in English and Russian languages during the last 10 years. The ages of the patients ranged from 18 to 75 years. Out of 114 reviewed works, 24 were found eligible. As per the available pharmacogenomic data, polymorphisms affecting DOACs are different. This may aid in developing individual approaches to optimize DOAC pharmacotherapy to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications. However, large-scale population studies are required to determine the dosage of the new oral anticoagulants based on genotyping. Information on the genetic effects is limited owing to the lack of large-scale studies. Uncovering the mechanisms of the genetic basis of sensitivity to DOACs helps in developing personalized therapy based on patient-specific genetic variants and improves the efficacy and safety of DOACs in the general population.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a simplified, standardized protocol for perioperative management of direct factor Xa inhibitors in patients, with AF undergoing procedures associated with minor bleeding risk. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective single-arm registry study plans to enroll patients undergoing procedures with minor bleeding risk who were prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors for AF. The procedures with minor bleeding risk will include gastrointestinal endoscopy for diagnostic purposes, selected dental procedures, and ocular surgery for cataracts or glaucoma. For apixaban, patients will withhold the last evening dose and resume either from the evening dose of the procedure day or the following morning, depending on the bleeding risk of the patient. For edoxaban or rivaroxaban, patients will withhold only a single dose on the procedure day. The primary outcome is the occurrence of major bleeding events within 30 days. Secondary outcomes include systemic thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and a composite of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events. CONCLUSION: This study has the potential to generate evidence regarding the safety of perioperative management for patients, with AF undergoing procedures associated with minor bleeding risk.

METHODS: All types of studies published on PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science up to 10 September 2023 and comparing outcomes of apixaban vs. VKA in dialysis patients were eligible. RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six retrospective studies were included. Apixaban treatment was associated with significantly lower risk of major bleeding (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.77; I2 = 50%) and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.98, I2 = 9%) compared to VKA. Meta-analysis also showed that the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.85, I2 = 16%) and intracranial bleeding (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.84, I2 = 0%) was significantly reduced with apixaban. Meta-analysis showed no difference in the risk of ischemic stroke (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.06, 2.69, I2 = 0%), mortality (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.74, 2.16, I2 = 94%) and recurrent venous thromboembolism (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.21, I2 = 0%) between the two groups. Subgroup analysis of RCTs showed no difference in bleeding outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality evidence from a mix of RCTs and retrospective studies shows that apixaban may have better safety and equivalent efficacy as compared to VKA in dialysis patients. Apixaban treatment correlated with significantly reduced risk of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in observational studies but not in RCTs. The predominance of retrospective data warrants caution in the interpretation of results.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants have shown similar efficacy and lower bleeding rates than vitamin K antagonists for venous thromboembolism. However, this has not been proven in mesenteric vein thrombosis. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of vitamin K antagonists and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. METHODS: Between January 2014 and July 2022, mesenteric vein thrombosis was diagnosed on computed tomography in 225 patients in a tertiary hospital. Among them, a total of 44 patients who underwent long-term anticoagulation therapy over 3 months were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups based on the anticoagulant used: vitamin K antagonists (Group 1, n = 21) and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (Group 2, n = 23). The efficacy outcomes were symptom recurrence and thrombus resolution on follow-up computed tomography, and the safety outcome was bleeding complications. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 56 years (range, 46-68 years), and 52% were men. The most common risk factors were unprovoked intra-abdominal infections (30%). The median duration of anticoagulation therapy was 13 months (20 months in Group 1 vs 6 months in Group 2; P = .076). Of the 44 patients, 17 (39%) received the standard treatment. The median follow-up period was longer in Group 1 than in Group 2 (57 vs 28 months; P = .048). No recurrence of mesenteric vein thrombosis-related symptoms were observed in either group. The median duration of follow-up computed tomography was 31 months (42 months in Group 1 vs 18 months in Group 2; P = .064). Computed tomography revealed complete thrombus resolution, partial resolution, and no changes in 71%, 19%, and 10%, respectively (P = .075). Regarding bleeding complications, varix bleeding and melena developed in two patients in Group 2, and anticoagulation treatment thereafter ceased. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the short follow-up duration in the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants group, there was no clinically significant difference in the thrombus resolution rate or bleeding complications when compared with the vitamin K antagonists group. Although research on the long-term effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients is limited, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants can be considered an alternative to conventional treatments.",

METHODS: All clinical trials and cohorts that compared the efficacy or safety of VKAs with DOACs in the treatment of LVTs were systematically searched until April 15, 2023. RESULTS: The results of 32 studies with a pooled sample size of 4213 patients were extracted for meta-analysis. DOACs, especially rivaroxaban and apixaban, cause faster resolution, lower mortality, and fewer complications (SSE and bleeding events) than VKAs in the management of LVTs.

Strict and regular assessments are mandatory during VKA therapy to ensure a potent anticoagulatory effect within the desired range. From the patients' perspective, VKA are associated with relevant interactions and side effects reducing the quality of life and contributing to a high number of patients not achieving the optimal therapeutic target. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have replaced VKA therapy in the past for several indications, e.g., atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unclear if DOACs could replace VKA therapy in patients after mechanical aortic valve replacement. While the PROACT-Xa study did not show a sufficient anticoagulatory effect of apixaban plus aspirin compared to VKA therapy in patients after mechanical aortic valve replacement, the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the oral factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban showed promising results in comparable patient cohorts in smaller studies and case reports. Factor Xa inhibitors were able to prevent thrombosis and thrombo-embolic events in patients after mechanical aortic valve replacement. Therefore, factor Xa inhibitors or factor XI inhibitors could provide a potent alternative to VKA for patients after a mechanical aortic valve replacement."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) exposes patients to an increased risk of PAD. We examined how the use of VKAs modulates the risk of incident PAD in people with T2D. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SURDIAGENE is a French cohort including 1468 patients with T2D with a prospective follow-up from 2002 to 2015. The primary outcome of the current analysis was the first occurrence of PAD, a composite of lower-limb amputation (LLA) or lower-limb revascularization. LLA and lower-limb revascularization were considered individually as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: During a 7-year median follow-up, PAD occurred in 147 (10%) of the 1468 participants. The use of VKAs was not significantly associated with the risk of PAD [multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-2.31]. During the study period, LLA and lower-limb revascularization occurred in 82 (6%) and 105 (7%) participants, respectively. The use of VKAs was significantly associated with increased risk of LLA [multivariable adjusted HR 1.90 (95% CI, 1.04-3.47)], but not lower-limb revascularization [multivariable adjusted HR 1.08 (95% CI, 0.59-1.97)]. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, we did not observe any excess risk of PAD requiring lower-limb revascularization in people with type 2 diabetes using VKAs. However, our data suggest a high risk of LLA in VKA users. Further studies are required to confirm this observation.",

Liver transplantation (LT) is a radical strategy for treating patients with early-stage HCC, which may lead to a better prognosis compared to hepatectomy and ablation. However, survival of patients who develop HCC recurrence after LT is short, and early recurrence is the most common cause of death. Thus, efficient biomarkers are also needed in LT to guide precision therapy to improve patient prognosis and 5-year survival. Protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) is an abnormal prothrombin that cannot activate coagulation, and it is significantly increased in patients with HCC, obstructive jaundice, and those taking vitamin K antagonists. Over the past decades, substantial progress has been made in the study of PIVKA-II in diagnosing, surveilling, and treating HCC, but its role in LT still needs to be elaborated. In this review, we focused on the role of PIVKA-II as a biomarker in LT for HCC, especially its relationship with clinicopathologic features, early recurrence, long-term survival, and donor-recipient selection."

Our aim was to compare the incidence of late bleeding events between patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and those on vitamin-K antagonists (VKA). METHODS: This single-center observational study included TAVI patients requiring oral anticoagulation at discharge between 2015 and 2021. The primary endpoint was any clinically significant bleeding event. Secondary endpoints were stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 702 TAVI procedures were performed, with 297 patients requiring oral anticoagulation at discharge. Among them, 206 (69.4%) received VKA and 91 (30.6%) received DOAC. Baseline clinical, procedural and in-hospital characteristics did not significantly differ between groups, except for better renal function among DOAC patients. The median length of follow-up was 2.8 years. The risk of bleeding events was higher in patients receiving DOACs than in those receiving VKA (HR, 2.27; 95%CI, 1.21-4.26; incidence of 9.7 and 4.2 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up for DOAC and VKA patients, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of stroke (HR, 1.28; 95%CI, 0.4-4.3), heart failure hospitalization (HR, 0.92; 95%CI, 0.46-1.86), or all-cause mortality (HR, 1.02; 95%CI, 0.68-1.55). CONCLUSIONS: In older patients undergoing TAVI and receiving anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation, the use of DOAC was associated with a higher risk of late bleeding events than VKA.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the appropriateness of prescribing profiles and intake adherence to non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING: The study was conducted in the Regional Health Administration of Northern Portugal. PARTICIPANTS: The authors selected a database of 21 854 patients with prescriptions for NOACs between January 2016 and December 2018 and were classified with AF until December 2018. OUTCOME MEASURES: The appropriate dosage of NOAC for patients with AF divided into three categories: contraindicated, inconsistent and consistent, based on the 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for AF. RESULTS: Dabigatran had a lower percentage of guideline-consistent doses (n=1657, 50.1%) than other drugs such as rivaroxaban (n=4737, 81.6%), apixaban (n=3830, 78.7%) and edoxaban (n=436, 82.1%). Most patients with an inconsistent dose were prescribed a lower dose than recommended based on their glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among patients younger than 75 years with GFR >60 mL/min, 59.8% (n=10 028) had an adequate GFR range, while 27.8% (n=7166) of GFR measurements from patients older than 75 years old and 29.4% (n=913) of GFR measurements from patients younger than 75 years with GFR <60 mL/min were within an adequate time range. Adherence to NOACs varied across different drugs, with 59.1% (n=540) adhering to edoxaban, 56.3% (n=5443) to rivaroxaban, 55.3% (n=3143) to dabigatran and 53.3% (n=4211) to apixaban. CONCLUSIONS: Dabigatran had the lowest percentage of guideline-consistent doses. Patients younger than 75 years with GFR >60 mL/min had the highest percentage with an adequate GFR range, while other groups who require closer GFR monitoring had lower percentages within an adequate GFR range. Adherence to NOACs differed among different drugs, with greater adherence to treatment with edoxaban and less adherence to apixaban.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Major bleeding occurs annually in 1%-3% of patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), despite close monitoring. Genetic variants in proteins involved in VKA response may affect this risk. AIM: To determine the association of genetic variants (cytochrome P450 enzymes 2C9 [CYP2C9] and 4F2 [CYP4F2], gamma-glutamyl carboxylase [GGCX]) with major bleeding in VKA users, separately and combined, including vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit-1 (VKORC1). METHODS: A case-cohort study was established within the BLEEDS cohort, which includes 16,570 patients who initiated VKAs between 2012 and 2014. We selected all 326 major bleeding cases that occurred during 17,613 years of follow-up and a random subcohort of 978 patients. We determined variants in CYP2C9, CYP4F2, GGCX, VKORC1 and evaluated the interaction between variant genotypes. Hazard ratios for major bleeding with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by weighted Cox regression. RESULTS: Genotype was determined in 256 cases and 783 subcohort members. Phenprocoumon was the most prescribed VKA for both cases and the subcohort (78% and 75%, respectively). Patients with major bleeding were slightly older than subcohort patients. CYP4F2-TT carriership was associated with a 1.6-fold (95% CI 0.9-2.8) increased risk of major bleeding compared with CC-alleles, albeit not statistically significant. For the CYP2C9 and GGCX variants instead, the major bleeding risk was around unity. Carrying at least two variant genotypes in CYP2C9 (poor metabolizer), CYP4F2-TT, and VKORC1-AA was associated with a 4.0-fold (95%CI 1.4-11.4) increased risk, while carriers of both CYP4F2-TT and VKORC1-AA had a particularly increased major bleeding risk (hazard ratio 6.7, 95% CI 1.5-29.8) compared with carriers of CC alleles in CYP4F2 and GG in VKORC1. However, the number of major bleeding cases in carriers of multiple variants was few (8 and 5 patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: CYP4F2 polymorphism was associated with major bleeding, especially in combination with VKORC1 genetic variants. These variants could be considered to further personalize anticoagulant treatment.",

Despite the importance of vitamin K administration at birth in preventing hemorrhagic disease in infants, some parents still refuse administration to their newborns. One of the unexpected but preventable reasons is the language barrier related to special dialects, resulting in misunderstanding the benefits of vitamin K administration and complications related to vitamin K deficiency. We present a case of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn due to vitamin K deficiency following the parental refusal of postnatal prophylactic vitamin K due to a language barrier that resulted in miscommunication. Although appropriate education was provided to the family via Spanish interpreter as requested, it was later revealed that the family was speaking a special dialect, and they did not fully understand the importance of vitamin K prophylaxis. The patient experienced intracranial hemorrhage with full recovery after treatment and surgical intervention. Upon reviewing the case, the parents were speaking a rare dialect of Spanish, that was not known to the Spanish medical interpreters. A combination of a Spanish medical translator and a family friend was necessary for effective communication with the family."

METHODS: We report an 84-year-old male patient with gallstones and cholecystitis who had a severe coagulation disorder without bleeding symptoms after endoscopic papillary balloon dilation for removal of bile duct stones. After vitamin K supplementation, the coagulation dysfunction was corrected the next day. RESULTS: In this case, long-term antibiotic treatment, inadequate diet, and abnormal liver function led to coagulation dysfunction. After vitamin K supplementation, the blood coagulation disorder was corrected and serious consequences were prevented. Significantly elevated coagulation function was considered to be caused by vitamin K deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This case indicates that coagulation dysfunction caused by vitamin K deficiency may occur within a few days. Laboratory personnel should fully understand the risks of vitamin K deficiency in elderly patients undergoing surgery with severely restricted diet, impaired absorption, and long-term use of cephalosporin anti-inflammatory therapy, and promptly remind clinical doctors.",

This process increases arterial stiffness, decreases elasticity, influences shear stress events and is related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. In numerous in vivo and in vitro models, warfarin therapy has been shown to cause vascular calcification in the arterial wall. However, the exact mechanisms of calcification formation with warfarin remain largely unknown, although several molecular pathways have been identified. Circulating miRNA have been evaluated as biomarkers for a wide range of cardiovascular diseases, but their exact role in cardiovascular calcification is limited. This review aims to describe the current state-of-the-art research on the impact of warfarin treatment on the development of vascular calcification and to highlight potential molecular targets, including microRNA, within the implicated pathways."

Patients were classified into two groups: one taking DOAC and the other taking VKA with a therapeutic INR range. The control group comprised non-anticoagulated subjects. Participants were matched regarding dentoalveolar procedure. The primary predictor was anticoagulant status. The primary outcome was postoperative bleeding. The DOAC group comprised 77 patients, while the VKA group and control group each consisted of 103 participants. In each group, 103 dentoalveolar surgical procedures were conducted. Postoperative bleeding was recorded in 3/103 (2.9%), 5/103 (4.8%), and 1/103 (0.97%) occasions in the DOAC, VKA, and control groups, respectively, without significant difference (χ2; p = 0.54). The fully adjusted odds ratio for postoperative bleeding was 0.14 (CI 0.01-1.61; p = 0.05) for patients taking DOAC and 0.19 (CI 0.02-1.65; p = 0.285) for those taking VKA compared with non-anticoagulated controls. In conclusion, there was no increase in risk for clinically significant postoperative bleeding after dentoalveolar surgery in patients taking DOAC or VKA compared with non-anticoagulated subjects. Dentoalveolar surgery in patients taking DOAC and VKA can be performed safely without therapy cessation. The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04505475).",

However, no robust data are available to date as to whether this also applies to the early phase after stroke. In this prospective registry study, we aimed to investigate whether anticoagulation with FXa inhibitors in the early phase after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is associated with a lower risk of major bleeding events compared with VKAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Prospective Record of the Use of Dabigatran in Patients with Acute Stroke or TIA (PRODAST) study is a prospective, multicenter, observational, post-authorization safety study at 86 German stroke units between July 2015 and November 2020. Primary outcome was a major bleeding event during hospital stay. Secondary endpoints were recurrent strokes, recurrent ischemic strokes, TIA, systemic/pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, death and the composite endpoint of stroke, systemic embolism, life-threatening bleeding and death. RESULTS: In total, 10,039 patients have been recruited. 5,874 patients were treated with FXa inhibitors and 1,050 patients received VKAs and were eligible for this analysis. Overall, event rates were low. We observed 49 major bleeding complications during 33,297 treatment days with FXa-inhibitors (rate of 14.7 cases per 10,000 treatment days) and 16 cases during 7,714 treatment days with VKAs (rate of 20.7 events per 10,000 treatment days), translating into an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.70 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.37-1.32) in favor of FXa inhibitors. Hazards for ischemic endpoints (63 vs 17 strokes, aHR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.53-1.74), mortality (33 vs 6 deaths, aHR: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.33-2.34)) and the combined endpoint (154 vs 39 events, aHR: 0.99 (95% CI: 0.65-1.41) were not substantially different. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This large real-world study shows that FXa inhibitors appear to be similarly effective in terms of bleeding events and ischemic endpoints compared to VKAs in the early post-stroke phase of hospitalization. However, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the low precision of the estimates.",

      "abstract": "Complete resistance to vitamin K antagonists is a rare but serious condition. It can complicate therapeutic management, especially when direct oral anticoagulants cannot be used. Some single mutations in the VKORC1 gene have been identified in patients partially or completely resistant to vitamin K antagonists. We report the cases of two women in their fifties who presented an unexplained peripheral venous thrombosis. The aetiological assessment did not show any abnormalities. Genetic testing showed that both patients had the VKORC1 5417 GG genotype. The VKORC1 3673 genotype was GG in case 1 and GA in case 2. The two patients showed complete resistance to vitamin K antagonists which required a change in treatment with favourable outcomes. Our goal is to offer optimal care guided by a literature review."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation have a high mortality rate that is only partially attributable to vascular outcomes. The competing risk of death may affect the expected anticoagulant benefit. We determined if competing risks materially affect the guideline-endorsed estimate of anticoagulant benefit. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials that randomized patients with atrial fibrillation to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or either placebo or antiplatelets. For each participant, we estimated the absolute risk reduction (ARR) of VKAs to prevent stroke or systemic embolism using 2 methods-first using a guideline-endorsed model (CHA2DS2-VASc) and then again using a competing risk model that uses the same inputs as CHA2DS2-VASc but accounts for the competing risk of death and allows for nonlinear growth in benefit. We compared the absolute and relative differences in estimated benefit and whether the differences varied by life expectancy. RESULTS: A total of 7933 participants (median age, 73 years, 36% women) had a median life expectancy of 8 years (interquartile range, 6-12), determined by comorbidity-adjusted life tables and 43% were randomized to VKAs. The CHA2DS2-VASc model estimated a larger ARR than the competing risk model (median ARR at 3 years, 6.9% [interquartile range, 4.7%-10.0%] versus 5.2% [interquartile range, 3.5%-7.4%]; P<0.001). ARR differences varied by life expectancies: for those with life expectancies in the highest decile, 3-year ARR difference (CHA2DS2-VASc model - competing risk model 3-year risk) was -1.3% (95% CI, -1.3% to -1.2%); for those with life expectancies in the lowest decile, 3-year ARR difference was 4.7% (95% CI, 4.5%-5.0%). CONCLUSIONS: VKA anticoagulants were exceptionally effective at reducing stroke risk. However, VKA benefits were misestimated with CHA2DS2-VASc, which does not account for the competing risk of death nor decelerating treatment benefit over time. Overestimation was most pronounced when life expectancy was low and when the benefit was estimated over a multiyear horizon.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing revascularization for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), low-dose Factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI) taken with aspirin improved limb and cardiovascular outcomes compared to aspirin alone. Furthermore, in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, FXaI are recommended over vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for chronic anticoagulation. While studies have evaluated different perioperative anticoagulation regimens in patients treated for PAD, the optimal regimen for chronic anticoagulation in patients with PAD undergoing peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) has not been determined. This analysis compares outcomes of patients after PVI that require chronic anticoagulation with FXaI and VKA. METHODS: The Vascular Quality Initiative-PVI database was used. Patients consistently treated with FXaI or VKA before the procedure, at discharge, and on long-term follow-up were defined as those receiving chronic anticoagulation. Patient demographics, procedural details, and perioperative and long-term outcomes were compared between FXaI and VKA groups. RESULTS: A total of 109,268 patients were analyzed, and 6,885 were chronically anticoagulated with FXaI (N = 2,427) or VKA (N = 4,458). Patients anticoagulated with VKA were more frequently males (65.3% vs. 61.0%, P < 0.001) with end-stage renal disease (9.7% vs. 4.6%, P < 0.001) and more likely to be treated for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (58.1% vs. 52.7%, P < 0.001). Rates of hematoma following PVI were significantly higher in patients taking VKA compared to FXaI (3.5% vs. 1.9%, P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that VKA were associated with increased perioperative hematoma than FXaI (odds ratio = 1.89 [1.30-2.82]). Compared to patients taking VKA, those receiving FXaI had lower rates of major amputation (6.7% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.020) and mortality (7.6% vs. 15.2%, P ≤ 0.001). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients consistently anticoagulated with FXaI had improved amputation-free survival after PVI. Adjusting for significant patient and procedural characteristics, Cox proportional hazard regression demonstrated that there is an increased risk for major amputation or mortality in patients using VKA compared to FXaI (hazard ratio 1.61, [1.36-1.90]). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic anticoagulation with FXaI as compared to VKA was associated with superior perioperative and long-term outcomes in patients with PAD undergoing PVI. FXaI should be the preferred agents over VKA for chronic anticoagulation in patients with PAD undergoing PVI.",
