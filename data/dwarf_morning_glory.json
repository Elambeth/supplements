      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify morning glory syndrome, an uncommon optic disc anomaly. Generally, it is an isolated ocular abnormality; however, some cranial facial and neurologic associations have been reported. PATIENTS: We herein report two patients with morning glory syndrome and associated pituitary dwarfism. In one patient, the pituitary insufficiency was secondary to compression of the pituitary gland by a basal encephalocele; in the second patient, causative factors were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with morning glory syndrome should have a complete general physical examination and growth evaluation so that early recognition and treatment of the patient with pituitary dwarfism can occur.",
