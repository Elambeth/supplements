      "abstract": "This review explores the therapeutic potential of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 in addressing electrolyte imbalances, specifically hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypermagnesemia, and hyperlithemia. In hyperkalemia, BPC 157 demonstrated a comprehensive counteractive effect against KCl overdose (intraperitoneally, intragastrically, and in vitro), effectively mitigating symptoms such as muscular weakness, hypertension, sphincter dysfunction, arrhythmias, and lethality. It also counteracted the adverse effects of succinylcholine and magnesium overdose, including systemic muscle paralysis, arrhythmias, and hyperkalemia. In hypokalemia, BPC 157 (administered prophylactically or therapeutically, intraperitoneally or intragastrically) prevented fatal outcomes and addressed furosemide-induced hypokalemia, ECG changes, AV conduction block, ventricular arrhythmias, and skeletal muscle myoclonus. Following magnesium overdose, BPC 157 alleviated muscle weakness, brain lesions, and hyperkalemia-induced complications. In vitro studies (HEK293 cells) revealed the ability of BPC 157 to counteract hyperkalemia- and hypermagnesemia-induced depolarization and hypokalemia-induced hyperpolarization. In lithium intoxication, BPC 157 promoted collateral pathway activation, resolved vascular and multiorgan failure, and counteracted advanced Virchow triad conditions and occlusion-like syndromes. Collectively, these findings underscore the therapeutic promise of BPC 157 in managing electrolyte imbalances and warrant further investigation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This is a novel rat study using native peptide therapy, focused on reversing quadriceps muscle-to-bone detachment to reattachment and stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 per-oral therapy for shared muscle healing and function restoration. METHODS: Pharmacotherapy recovering various muscle, tendon, ligament, and bone lesions, and severed junctions (i.e., myotendinous junction), per-oral in particular (BPC 157/kg/day 10 µg, 10 ng), provides muscle-to-bone reattachment after quadriceps muscle detachment, both complete (rectus muscle) and partial (vastus muscles). RESULTS: Immediately post-injury, and at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 90 days post-injury, quadriceps muscle-to-bone detachment showed definitive healing failure (impaired walking and permanent knee flexure). Contrarily, macro/microscopic, ultrasonic, magnetic resonance, biomechanical, and functional assessments revealed that BPC 157 therapy recovering effects for all time points were consistent. All parameters of the walking pattern fully improved, and soon after detachment and therapy application, muscle approached the bone, leaving a minimal gap (on ultrasonic assessment), and leg contracture was annihilated. The healing process occurs immediately after detachment from both sides: the muscle and the bone. The reattachment fibers from the ends of the muscle could be traced into the new bone formed at the surface (note, at day 3 post-detachment, increased mesenchymal cells occurred with periosteum reactivation). Consequently, at 3 months, the form was stable, and the balance between the muscle and bone was the following: well-organized bone, newly formed as more cortical bone providing a narrower bone marrow space, and the muscle and mature fibers were oriented parallel to the bone axis and were in close contact with bone. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, to achieve quadriceps muscle-to-bone reattachment, the BPC 157 therapy reversing course acts from the beginning, resolving an otherwise insurmountable deleterious course."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Moderate to severe interstitial cystitis (also known as bladder pain syndrome) is a disabling disease with no effective treatment. Although pentosan polysulfate is an approved treatment for interstitial cystitis, some patients on this medication experience treatment failure after one year, and its long-term use has been linked to pigmentary maculopathy. The peptide Body Protective Compound 157 (BPC-157) is a possible treatment for interstitial cystitis but is currently not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of BPC-157 manufactured by a 503A compounding pharmacy as a treatment for interstitial cystitis. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve women between the ages of 39 and 76 years with a mean age of 58.3 years participated in this trial at a private clinic. Of these, 10 were White, one was Asian, and one was Latina. None of the 12 women had responded to pentosan polysulfate. METHODS: The women underwent cystoscopy and were treated with injections of the peptide BPC-157 (total of 10 mg) around the area of inflammation of the bladder during a single procedure. Global Response Assessment questionnaire was given to all the subjects to assess the efficacy of BPC-157. RESULTS: Complete resolution of symptoms after one treatment was reported in 10 of 12 patients, who rated their success at 100%. The remaining 2 of 12 patients rated their success at 80%, with most symptoms resolved but about 20% of their symptoms lingering. No one dropped out of the study, and no adverse events were reported. This therapy was successful because all 12 patients scored a 5/5 on the Global Response Assessment. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of intravesical BPC-157 (10 mg) injection to help patients with moderate to severe interstitial cystitis who did not respond to pentosan polysulfate treatment.",

      "abstract": "By introducing the healing of many distinctive anastomoses by BPC 157 therapy, this review practically deals with the concept of the resection and reconnection of the hollow parts of the gastrointestinal tract as one of the cornerstones of visceral surgery. In principle, the healing of quite distinctive anastomoses itself speaks for applied BPC 157 therapy, in particular, as a way in which the therapy of anastomoses can be successfully approached and carried out. Some of the anastomoses implicated were esophagogastric, colocolonic, jejunoileal, and ileoileal anastomoses, along with concomitant disturbances, such as esophagitis, sphincter dysfunction, failed intestinal adaptation, colitis, short bowel syndrome, major vessel occlusion, NO-system, and prostaglandins-system dysfunction, which were accordingly counteracted as well, and, finally, findings concerning other anastomoses healing (i.e., nerve and vessel). Moreover, the healing of fistulas, both external and internal, colocutaneous, gastrocutaneous, esophagocutaneous, duodenocutaneous, vesicovaginal, colovesical, and rectovaginal in rats, perceived as anastomoses made between two different tissues which are normally not connected, may also be indicative. This may be a particular reconnection of the parts of the gastrointestinal tract to re-establish adequate integrity depending on the tissue involved, given that both various intestinal anastomoses and various fistulas (intestinal and skin were accordingly healed simultaneously as the fistulas disappeared) were all healed."

      "abstract": "We highlight the particular aspects of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 pleiotropic beneficial activity (not destroyed in human gastric juice, native and stable in human gastric juice, as a cytoprotection mediator holds a response specifically related to preventing or recovering damage as such) and its possible relations with neurotransmitter activity. We attempt to resolve the shortage of the pleiotropic beneficial effects of BPC 157, given the general standard neurotransmitter criteria, in classic terms. We substitute the lack of direct conclusive evidence (i.e., production within the neuron or present in it as a precursor molecule, released eliciting a response on the receptor on the target cells on neurons and being removed from the site of action once its signaling role is complete). This can be a network of interconnected evidence, previously envisaged in the implementation of the cytoprotection effects, consistent beneficial particular evidence that BPC 157 therapy counteracts dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, adrenalin/noradrenalin, acetylcholine, and NO-system disturbances. This specifically includes counteraction of those disturbances related to their receptors, both blockade and over-activity, destruction, depletion, tolerance, sensitization, and channel disturbances counteraction. Likewise, BPC 157 activates particular receptors (i.e., VGEF and growth hormone). Furthermore, close BPC 157/NO-system relations with the gasotransmitters crossing the cell membrane and acting directly on molecules inside the cell may envisage particular interactions with receptors on the plasma membrane of their target cells. Finally, there is nerve-muscle relation in various muscle disturbance counteractions, and nerve-nerve relation in various encephalopathies counteraction, which is also exemplified specifically by the BPC 157 therapy application."

      "abstract": "Given in reperfusion, the use of stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 is an effective therapy in rats. It strongly counteracted, as a whole, decompression/reperfusion-induced occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome following the worst circumstances of acute abdominal compartment and intra-abdominal hypertension, grade III and grade IV, as well as compression/ischemia-occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome. Before decompression (calvariectomy, laparotomy), rats had long-lasting severe intra-abdominal hypertension, grade III (25 mmHg/60 min) (i) and grade IV (30 mmHg/30 min; 40 mmHg/30 min) (ii/iii), and severe occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome. Further worsening was caused by reperfusion for 60 min (i) or 30 min (ii/iii). Severe vascular and multiorgan failure (brain, heart, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal lesions), widespread thrombosis (peripherally and centrally) severe arrhythmias, intracranial (superior sagittal sinus) hypertension, portal and caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension were aggravated. Contrarily, BPC 157 therapy (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg sc) given at 3 min reperfusion times eliminated/attenuated venous hypertension (intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval) and aortal hypotension and counteracted the increases in organ lesions and malondialdehyde values (blood ˃ heart, lungs, liver, kidney ˃ brain, gastrointestinal tract). Vascular recovery promptly occurred (i.e., congested inferior caval and superior mesenteric veins reversed to the normal vessel presentation, the collapsed azygos vein reversed to a fully functioning state, the inferior caval vein-superior caval vein shunt was recovered, and direct blood delivery returned). BPC 157 therapy almost annihilated thrombosis and hemorrhage (i.e., intracerebral hemorrhage) as proof of the counteracted general stasis and Virchow triad circumstances and reorganized blood flow. In conclusion, decompression/reperfusion-induced occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome counteracted by BPC 157 therapy in rats is likely for translation in patients. It is noteworthy that by rapidly counteracting the reperfusion course, it also reverses previous ischemia-course lesions, thus inducing complete recovery."

      "abstract": "After inferior caval vein embolization therapy, post-embolization syndrome (sodium laurate 10 mg/kg, 0.1 mL into rat inferior caval vein, assessment at 15, 30, 60 min, prime lung lesions, thromboemboli occluding lung vessels), as a severe occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome, might be resolved as a whole by stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy. At 5 min after laurate injection, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was implemented as therapy (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg intraperitoneally or intragastrically). As before, confronted with the occlusion of major vessel(s) or similar noxious procedures, such as rapidly acting Virchow triad circumstances, the particular effect of the therapy (i.e., collateral pathways activation, \"bypassing vascular key\", i.e., direct blood flow delivery via activation of azygos vein) assisted in the recovery of the vessel/s and counteracted multiorgan failure due to occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome as a whole in the laurate-injected rats. Along with prime lung lesions and thromboemboli occluding lung vessels, post-embolization syndrome rapidly occurred peripherally and centrally as a shared multiorgan and vessel failure, brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract lesions, venous hypertension (intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval), aortal hypotension, progressing thrombosis in veins and arteries and stasis, congested and/or failed major veins, and severe ECG disturbances. Whatever the cause, these were all counteracted, eliminated, or attenuated by the application of BPC 157 therapy. As recovery with BPC 157 therapy commonly and rapidly occurred, reversing the collapsed azygos vein to the rescuing collateral pathway might initiate rapid direct blood delivery and start blood flow reorganization. In conclusion, we suggest BPC 157 therapy to resolve further vascular and embolization injuries."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Using rat stomach perforation as a prototypic direct lesion applied in cytoprotection research, we focused on the first demonstration of the severe occlusion/ occlusion-like syndrome induced by stomach perforation. The revealed stomach-induced occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome corresponds to the previously described occlusion/occlusion-like syndromes in rats suffering multicausal pathology and shared severe vascular and multiorgan failure. This general point was particularly reviewed. As in all the described occlusion/occlusion-like syndromes with permanent occlusion of major vessels, peripheral and central, and other similar noxious procedures that severely affect endothelium function, the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was resolving therapy. AIM: To reveal the stomach perforation-induced general occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome and BPC 157 therapy effect. METHODS: The procedure included deeply anesthetized rats, complete calvariectomy, laparotomy at 15 min thereafter, and stomach perforation to rapidly induce vascular and multiorgan failure occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome. At 5 min post-perforation time, rats received therapy [BPC 157 (10 µg or 10 ng/kg) or saline (5 mL/kg, 1 mL/rat) (controls)] into the perforated defect in the stomach). Sacrifice was at 15 min or 60 min post-perforation time. Assessment (gross and microscopy; volume) included: Brain swelling, peripheral vessels (azygos vein, superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, inferior caval vein) and heart, other organs lesions (i.e., stomach, defect closing or widening); superior sagittal sinus, and peripherally the portal vein, inferior caval vein, and abdominal aorta blood pressures and clots; electrocardiograms; and bleeding time from the perforation(s). RESULTS: BPC 157 beneficial effects accord with those noted before in the healing of the perforated defect (raised vessel presentation; less bleeding, defect contraction) and occlusion/occlusion-like syndromes counteraction. BPC 157 therapy (into the perforated defect), induced immediate shrinking and contraction of the whole stomach (unlike considerable enlargement by saline application). Accordingly, BPC 157 therapy induced direct blood delivery via the azygos vein, and attenuated/eliminated the intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal and caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension. Thrombosis, peripherally (inferior caval vein, portal vein, abdominal aorta) and centrally (superior sagittal sinus) BPC 157 therapy markedly reduced/annihilated. Severe lesions in the brain (swelling, hemorrhage), heart (congestion and arrhythmias), lung (hemorrhage and congestion), and marked congestion in the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract were markedly reduced. CONCLUSION: We revealed stomach perforation as a severe occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome, peripherally and centrally, and rapid counteraction by BPC 157 therapy. Thereby, further BPC 157 therapy may be warranted.",

      "abstract": "Recently, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy by activation of collateral pathways counteracted various occlusion/occlusion-like syndromes, vascular, and multiorgan failure, and blood pressure disturbances in rats with permanent major vessel occlusion and similar procedures disabling endothelium function. Thereby, we revealed BPC 157 cytoprotective therapy with strong vascular rescuing capabilities in glaucoma therapy. With these capabilities, BPC 157 therapy can recover glaucomatous rats, normalize intraocular pressure, maintain retinal integrity, recover pupil function, recover retinal ischemia, and corneal injuries (i.e., maintained transparency after complete corneal abrasion, corneal ulceration, and counteracted dry eye after lacrimal gland removal or corneal insensitivity). The most important point is that in glaucomatous rats (three of four episcleral veins cauterized) with high intraocular pressure, all BPC 157 regimens immediately normalized intraocular pressure. BPC 157-treated rats exhibited normal pupil diameter, microscopically well-preserved ganglion cells and optic nerve presentation, normal fundus presentation, nor- mal retinal and choroidal blood vessel presentation, and normal optic nerve presentation. The one episcleral vein rapidly upgraded to accomplish all functions in glaucomatous rats may correspond with occlusion/occlusion-like syndromes of the activated rescuing collateral pathway (azygos vein direct blood flow delivery). Normalized intraocular pressure in glaucomatous rats corresponded to the counteracted intra-cranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension in occlusion/occlusion-like syndromes, were all attenuated/eliminated by BPC 157 therapy. Furthermore, given in other eye disturbances (i.e., retinal ischemia), BPC 157 instantly breaks a noxious chain of events, both at an early stage and an already advanced stage. Thus, we further advocate BPC 157 as a therapeutic agent in ocular disease."

      "abstract": "We focused on the first demonstration that antiarrhythmics, particularly class II and class III antiarrhythmic and beta-blocker sotalol can induce severe occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome in rats. In this syndrome, as in similar syndromes with permanent occlusion of major vessels, peripheral and central, and other similar noxious procedures that severely disable endothelium function, the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157-collateral pathways activation, was a resolving therapy. After a high dose of sotalol (80 mg/kg intragastrically) in 180 min study, there were cause-consequence lesions in the brain (swelling, intracerebral hemorrhage), congestion in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, severe bradycardia, and intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal and caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension, and widespread thrombosis, peripherally and centrally. Major vessels failed (congested inferior caval and superior mesenteric vein, collapsed azygos vein). BPC 157 therapy (10 µg, 10 ng/kg given intragastrically at 5 min or 90 min sotalol-time) effectively counteracted sotalol-occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome. In particular, eliminated were heart dilatation, and myocardial congestion affecting coronary veins and arteries, as well as myocardial vessels; eliminated were portal and caval hypertension, lung parenchyma congestion, venous and arterial thrombosis, attenuated aortal hypotension, and centrally, attenuated intracranial (superior sagittal sinus) hypertension, brain lesions and pronounced intracerebral hemorrhage. Further, BPC 157 eliminated and/or markedly attenuated liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract congestion and major veins congestion. Therefore, azygos vein activation and direct blood delivery were essential for particular BPC 157 effects. Thus, preventing such and similar events, and responding adequately when that event is at risk, strongly advocates for further BPC 157 therapy."

      "abstract": "Even before behavioral disturbances, neuroleptics, amphetamine, and domperidone application rapidly emerged severe occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome, shared innate vascular and multiorgan failure in rats, comparable to occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome described with vessel(s) occlusion or similar noxious procedures application. As therapy, i.e., activation of the collateral pathways, \"bypassing key\" (activated azygos vein pathway, direct blood flow delivery), the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 is a novel solution. Recently, BPC 157 therapy particularly counteracted neuroleptic- or L-NAME-induced catalepsy, lithium intoxication, and schizophrenia positive and negative symptoms (amphetamine/methamphetamine/apomorphine/ketamine). In rats with complete calvariectomy, medication (BPC 157 10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg ip or ig) was given 5 min after distinctive dopamine agents (mg/kg ip) (haloperidol (5), fluphenazine (5), clozapine (10), risperidone (5), olanzapine (10), quetiapine (10), or aripiprazole (10), domperidone (25), amphetamine (10), and combined amphetamine and haloperidol) and assessed at 15 min thereafter. All neuroleptic-, domperidone-, and amphetamine-induced comparable vascular and multiorgan failure severe syndrome was alleviated with BPC 157 therapy as before major vessel(s) occlusion or other similar noxious procedures. Specifically, all severe lesions in the brain (i.e., immediate swelling, hemorrhage), heart (i.e., congestion, arrhythmias), and lung (i.e., congestion, hemorrhage), as well as congestion in the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal (stomach) tract, were resolved. Intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval hypertension and aortal hypotension were attenuated or eliminated. BPC 157 therapy almost annihilated arterial and venous thrombosis, peripherally and centrally. Thus, rapidly acting Virchow triad circumstances that occur as dopamine central/peripheral antagonists and agonist essential class-points, fully reversed by BPC 157 therapy, might be overwhelming for both neuroleptics and amphetamine."

      "abstract": "Conceptually, a wide beneficial effect, both peripherally and centrally, might have been essential for the harmony of brain-gut and gut-brain axes' function. Seen from the original viewpoint of the gut peptides' significance and brain relation, the favorable stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 evidence in the brain-gut and gut-brain axes' function might have been presented as a particular interconnected network. These were the behavioral findings (interaction with main systems, anxiolytic, anticonvulsive, antidepressant effect, counteracted catalepsy, and positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms models). Muscle healing and function recovery appeared as the therapeutic effects of BPC 157 on the various muscle disabilities of a multitude of causes, both peripheral and central. Heart failure was counteracted (including arrhythmias and thrombosis), and smooth muscle function recovered. These existed as a multimodal muscle axis impact on muscle function and healing as a function of the brain-gut axis and gut-brain axis as whole. Finally, encephalopathies, acting simultaneously in both the periphery and central nervous system, BPC 157 counteracted stomach and liver lesions and various encephalopathies in NSAIDs and insulin rats. BPC 157 therapy by rapidly activated collateral pathways counteracted the vascular and multiorgan failure concomitant to major vessel occlusion and, similar to noxious procedures, reversed initiated multicausal noxious circuit of the occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome. Severe intracranial (superior sagittal sinus) hypertension, portal and caval hypertensions, and aortal hypotension were attenuated/eliminated. Counteracted were the severe lesions in the brain, lungs, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. In particular, progressing thrombosis, both peripherally and centrally, and heart arrhythmias and infarction that would consistently occur were fully counteracted and/or almost annihilated. To conclude, we suggest further BPC 157 therapy applications."

      "abstract": "Using duodenocolic fistula in rats, this study attempts to highlight the particular cytoprotection aspects of the healing of fistulas and therapy potential of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, a cytoprotection mediator (i.e. upgrading minor vessels to induce healing at both fistula's sides). Upon duodenocolic fistula creation (two 'perforated' lesions put together) (assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 min), BPC 157, given locally at the fistula, or intragastrically (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg), rapidly induces vessel 'recruitment', 'running' toward the defect, simultaneously at duodenum and colon, providing numerous collaterals and branching. The mRNA expression studies done at that time provided strongly elevated (nitric oxide synthase 2) and decreased (cyclooxygenase-2, vascular endothelial growth factor A, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-1, NOS-3, nuclear factor-kappa-B-activating protein) gene expression. As therapy, rats with duodenocolic fistulas, received BPC 157 10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg, per-orally, in drinking water till sacrifice, or alternatively, intraperitoneally, first application at 30 min after surgery, last at 24 h before sacrifice, at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Controls exhibited both defects persisting, continuous fistula leakage, diarrhea, continuous weight loss, advanced adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction. Contrary, all BPC 157-treated rats have closed both defects, duodenal and colonic, no fistula leakage (finally, maximal instilled volume corresponds to healthy rats), no cachexia, the same weight as before surgery, no diarrhea, markedly less adhesion formation and intestinal passage obstruction. Thus, BPC 157 regimens resolve the duodenal/colon lesions and duodenocolic fistulas in rats, and rapid vessels recovery appears as the essential point in the implementation of the cytoprotection concept in the fistula therapy.",

As a follow up, we reviewed that with the BPC 157 therapy, its cytoprotective ability to organize simultaneous healing of different tissues of and full recovery of the myotendinous junction might represent the particular muscle therapy against distinctive etiopathology muscle disabilities and weakness. In this, BPC 157 therapy might recover many of muscle disabilities (i.e., succinylcholine, vascular occlusion, spinal cord compression, stroke, traumatic brain injury, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurotoxins, neuroleptics, alcohol, serotonin syndrome and NO-system blockade and tumor-cachexia). These might provide practical realization of the multimodal muscle-axis impact able to react depending on the condition and the given agent(s) and the symptoms distinctively related to the prime injurious cause symptoms in the wide healing concept, the concept of cytoprotection, in particular. Further, the BPC 157 therapy might be the recovery for the disabled heart functioning, and disabled smooth muscle functioning (various sphincters function recovery). Finally, BPC 157, native and stable in human gastric juice, might be a prototype of anti-ulcer cytoprotective peptide for the muscle therapy with high curing potential (very safe profile (lethal dose not achieved), with suited wide effective range (µg-ng regimens) and ways of application)."

      "abstract": "Recently, it was found that when confronted with major vessel occlusion and vascular failure, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy might rapidly functionally improve minor vessels to take over the function of disabled major vessels, reorganize blood flow, and compensate failed vessel function. We focused on the BPC 157 therapy effect obtained by giving 10 ng/kg ip to rats 5 min before sacrifice on the rat thoracic aorta, which we assessed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 90 min thereafter. We applied a principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA model showed, with a clear distinction being mostly due to the PC1 score, differences between the spectra of BPC 157- and saline-treated rats. The comparison of the averaged spectra of these two groups with their differential spectrum and PC loadings allowed us to identify the parts of the FTIR spectra that contributed the most to the spectral separation of the two observed groups. The PC1 loadings and the differential spectrum showed that the main bands affecting the separation were the amid I band around 1650 cm-1, the amid II band around 1540 cm-1, and the vibrational band around 1744 cm-1. Fitting the spectral range between 1450 and 1800 cm-1 showed changes in protein conformation and confirmed the appearance of the vibrational band at 1744 cm-1. Controls had a substantially more intense vibrational band at 1744 cm-1. These spectral results showed the cells from saline-treated (control) rats to be in the early stage of cell death, while the samples from BPC 157-rats were protected. Thus, BPC 157 therapy changed the lipid contents and protein secondary structure conformation, with a rapid effect on vessels, within a short time upon application."

      "abstract": "In heart disturbances, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 especial therapy effects combine the therapy of myocardial infarction, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension arrhythmias, and thrombosis prevention and reversal. The shared therapy effect occurred as part of its even larger cytoprotection (cardioprotection) therapy effect (direct epithelial cell protection; direct endothelium cell protection) that BPC 157 exerts as a novel cytoprotection mediator, which is native and stable in human gastric juice, as well as easily applicable. Accordingly, there is interaction with many molecular pathways, combining maintained endothelium function and maintained thrombocytes function, which counteracted thrombocytopenia in rats that underwent major vessel occlusion and deep vein thrombosis and counteracted thrombosis in all vascular studies; the coagulation pathways were not affected. These appeared as having modulatory effects on NO-system (NO-release, NOS-inhibition, NO-over-stimulation all affected), controlling vasomotor tone and the activation of the Src-Caveolin-1-eNOS pathway and modulatory effects on the prostaglandins system (BPC 157 counteracted NSAIDs toxicity, counteracted bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and in particular, leaky gut syndrome). As an essential novelty noted in the vascular studies, there was the activation of the collateral pathways. This might be the upgrading of the minor vessel to take over the function of the disabled major vessel, competing with and counteracting the Virchow triad circumstances devastatingly present, making possible the recruitment of collateral blood vessels, compensating vessel occlusion and reestablishing the blood flow or bypassing the occluded or ruptured vessel. As a part of the counteraction of the severe vessel and multiorgan failure syndrome, counteracted were the brain, lung, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal lesions, and in particular, the counteraction of the heart arrhythmias and infarction."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) is the major complication for cancer patients after radiation therapy. We investigated the protective effects of BPC 157 peptide in reducing RILD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were irradiated with a single dose of 12 Gy to induce acute liver injury with or without oral BPC 157. Plasma levels of AST and ALT were determined. In vitro rat liver clone 9 cells and in vivo liver tissues were harvested for MTT assay, TUNEL assay, lipid staining, polypoid cell counts, Western blotting of caspase-3, PCNA, KLF-4 and HIF-2α, and immunocytochemistry for PCNA, KLF-4 and HIF-2α. SiRNAs were used to knockdown KLF-4. KEY FINDINGS: BPC 157 was firstly demonstrated to reduce RILD by decreasing plasma levels of AST and ALT, and inhibiting hydropic degeneration of liver. BPC 157 significantly decreased radiation-induced cell apoptosis, increased PCNA expression, promoted the expression of KLF4, decreased the radiation-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and HIF-2α expression both in mice liver and in clone 9 liver cells. The knockdown of KLF4 abolished the protective effect of BPC 157 on radiation-induced apoptosis and lipid accumulation in clone 9 liver cells, indicating that the protective effect of BPC 157 was mediated by KLF4 in liver cells. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study provided a good model for molecular mechanism underlying the acute RILD. BPC 157, as a stable pentadecapeptide that can be chemically synthesized and purified easily for research, together with its in vivo markedly protective effect made it worth of being investigated for future clinical application for RILD.",

This might be the find out the NO-system organized therapy (i.e., simultaneously implied NO-system blockade (L-NAME) vs. NO-system over-stimulation (L-arginine) vs. NO-system immobilization (L-NAME+L-arginine)). The ketamine regimen (intraperitoneally/kg) included: 3 mg (cognitive dysfunction, novel object recognition test), 30 mg (anxiogenic effect (open field test) and anhedonia (sucrose test)), and 8 mg/3 days (social withdrawal). Medication (mg/kg intraperitoneally) was L-NAME (5), L-arginine (100), and BPC 157 (0.01), alone and/or together, given immediately before ketamine (L-NAME, L-arginine, and combination) or given immediately after (BPC 157 and combinations). BPC 157 counteracted ketamine-cognition dysfunction, social withdrawal, and anhedonia, and exerted additional anxiolytic effect. L-NAME (antagonization, social withdrawal) and L-arginine (antagonization, cognitive dysfunction, anhedonia) both included worsening cognitive dysfunction, anhedonia, and anxiogenic effect (L-NAME), social withdrawal, and anxiogenic effect (L-arginine). Thus, ketamine-induced resembling \"negative-like\" schizophrenia symptoms were \"L-NAME non-responsive, L-arginine responsive\" (cognition dysfunction), \"L-NAME responsive, L-arginine non-responsive\" (social withdrawal), \"L-NAME responsive, L-arginine responsive, opposite effect\" (anhedonia) and \"L-NAME responsive, L-arginine responsive, parallel effect\" (both anxiogening). In cognition dysfunction, BPC 157 overwhelmed NO-agents effects. The mRNA expression studies in brain tissue evidenced considerable overlapping of gene overexpression in healthy rats treated with ketamine or BPC 157. With the BPC 157 therapy applied immediately after ketamine, the effect on Nos1, Nos2, Plcg1, Prkcg, and Ptgs2 (increased or decreased expression), appeared as a timely specific BPC 157 effect on ketamine-specific targets."

Additionally, we revealed the therapy's effect on the acute pancreatitis as vascular failure and multiorgan failure, both peripherally and centrally following \"occlusion-like\" syndrome, major intoxication (alcohol, lithium), maintained severe intra-abdominal hypertension, and myocardial infarction, or occlusion syndrome, and major vessel occlusion. The application-sacrifice periods were ligation times of 0-30 min, 0-5 h, 0-24 h (cured periods, early regimen) and 4.30 h-5 h, 5 h-24 h (cured periods, delayed regimen). Otherwise, bile duct-ligated rats commonly presented intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal and caval hypertension and aortal hypotension, gross brain swelling, hemorrhage and lesions, heart dysfunction, lung lesions, liver and kidney failure, gastrointestinal lesions, and severe arterial and venous thrombosis, peripherally and centrally. Unless antagonized with the key effect of BPC 157 regimens, reversal of the inferior caval and superior mesenteric vein congestion and reversal of the failed azygos vein activated azygos vein-recruited direct delivery to rescue the inferior-superior caval vein pathway; these were all antecedent to acute pancreatitis major lesions (i.e., acinar, fat necrosis, hemorrhage). These lesions appeared in the later period, but were markedly attenuated/eliminated (i.e., hemorrhage) in BPC 157-treated rats. To summarize, while the innate vicious cycle may be peripheral (bile duct ligation), or central (rapidly developed brain disturbances), or peripheral and central, BPC 157 resolved acute pancreatitis and its adjacent syndrome."

Besides the demonstrated rapid and sustained recovery (1 year), we showed the particular points of the immediate effect of the BPC 157 therapy that began rapidly after its administration, (i) soon after injury (10 min), or (ii) later (4 days), in the rats with a definitive spinal cord injury. Specifically, in counteracting spinal cord hematoma and swelling, (i) in rats that had undergone acute spinal cord injury, followed by intraperitoneal BPC 157 application at 10 min, we focused on the first 10-30 min post-injury period (assessment of gross, microscopic, and gene expression changes). Taking day 4 post-injury as the definitive injury, (ii) we focused on the immediate effects after the BPC 157 intragastric application over 20 min of the post-therapy period. Comparable long-time recovery was noted in treated rats which had definitive tail paralysis: (iii) the therapy was continuously given per orally in drinking water, beginning at day 4 after injury and lasting one month after injury. BPC 157 rats presented only discrete edema and minimal hemorrhage and increased Nos1, Nos2, and Nos3 values (30 min post-injury, (i)) or only mild hemorrhage, and only discrete vacuolation of tissue (day 4, (ii)). In the day 4-30 post-injury study (iii), BPC 157 rats rapidly presented tail function recovery, and no demyelination process (Luxol fast blue staining)."

Agents (mg/kg) or saline (controls) were given at 1 min post-injury as an abdominal bath (10 ml/rat throughout 2 min). Within 1 - 15 min post-injury period, with cytoprotective BPC 157 (0.01 μg), the rapidly restored vessels 'run' (vessels filled/reappeared) toward the perforated defect, and there is less bleeding, and defect contraction; advanced perforated lesion healing (day 1) to complete healing (day 7), and less adhesions. With pantoprazole (10 mg), early (vessels (worsening), bleeding (prolongation), defect (attenuated widening)) effect means eventual lesions and adhesions severity as in controls. Ranitidine (10 mg) early effect (vessels (improvement), bleeding (less bleeding), defect (eliminated widening, defect not changed)) means final lesions attenuation, but not complete healing, less adhesions. L-NAME (5 mg) early (vessels worsening, less bleeding, attenuated defect widening) and final (lesions aggravation, more adhesions) effect, versus L-arginine (100 mg) early (vessels improvement, more bleeding, attenuated defect widening) and final (lesions attenuation, less adhesions) effect, combined few simultaneously occurring nitric oxide (NO)-system distinct processes. Finally, in the stomach tissue surrounding defect, increased malondialdehyde (MDA)- and decreased NO-values, BPC 157 reversed to the normal healthy values, and mRNA expression studies (Cox2, VEGFa, Nos1, Nos 2, Nos3, Nkap (NF-kappa-B-activating protein gene)), done at that very early post-perforation-time, indicate a way how BPC 157 may act beneficially in the perforated stomach lesion throughout NO- and prostaglandinds-system.",

BPC 157 (10 ng/kg, 10 µg/kg i.p.), L-NAME (5 mg/kg i.p.), and L-arginine (200 mg/kg i.p.) were given alone or together at (i) 30 min before or, alternatively, (ii) at 5 min after isoprenaline (75 or 150 mg/kg s.c.). At 30 min after isoprenaline 75 mg/kg s.c., we noted an early multiorgan failure (brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal lesions), thrombosis, intracranial (superior sagittal sinus) hypertension, portal and caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension, in its full presentation (or attenuated by BPC 157 therapy (given at 5 min after isoprenaline) via activation of the azygos vein). Further, we studied isoprenaline (75 or 150 mg/kg s.c.) myocardial infarction (1 challenge) and reinfarction (isoprenaline at 0 h and 24 h, 2 challenges) in rats (assessed at the end of the subsequent 24 h period). BPC 157 reduced levels of all necrosis markers, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and cTnT, and attenuated gross (no visible infarcted area) and histological damage, ECG (no ST-T ischemic changes), and echocardiography (preservation of systolic left ventricular function) damage induced by isoprenaline. Its effect was associated with a significant decrease in oxidative stress parameters and likely maintained NO system function, providing that BPC 157 interacted with eNOS and COX2 gene expression in a particular way and counteracted the noxious effect of the NOS-blocker, L-NAME."

      "abstract": "The stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 counteracts various venous occlusion-induced syndromes. Summarized are all these arguments, in the Robert's cytoprotection concept, to substantiate the resolution of different major vessel occlusion disturbances, in particular ischemia-reperfusion injury following the Pringle maneuver and Budd-Chiari syndrome, which was obtained by BPC 157 therapy. Conceptually, there is a new point, namely, endothelium maintenance to epithelium maintenance (the recruitment of collateral blood vessels to compensate for vessel occlusion and reestablish blood flow or bypass the occluded or ruptured vessel). In this paper, we summarize the evidence of the native cytoprotective gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, which is stable in the human gastric juice, is a membrane stabilizer and counteracts gut-leaky syndrome. As a particular target, it is distinctive from the standard peptide growth factors, involving particular molecular pathways and controlling VEGF and NO pathways. In the early 1990s, BPC 157 appeared as a late outbreak of the Robert's and Szabo's cytoprotection-organoprotection concept, like the previous theoretical/practical breakthrough in the 1980s and the brain-gut axis and gut-brain axis. As the time went on, with its reported effects, it is likely most useful theory practical implementation and justification. Meantime, several reviews suggest that BPC 157, which does not have a lethal dose, has profound cytoprotective activity, used to be demonstrated in ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis trials. Likely, it may bring the theory to practical application, starting with the initial argument, no degradation in human gastric juice for more than 24 h, and thereby, the therapeutic effectiveness (including via a therapeutic per-oral regimen) and pleiotropic beneficial effects.",

If not upgraded, one episcleral vein is regularly unable to acquire and take over the whole function, and glaucoma-like features persist. Recently, the rapid upgrading of the collateral pathways by a stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 has cured many severe syndromes induced by permanent occlusion of major vessels, veins and/or arteries, peripherally and centrally. In a six-week study, medication was given prophylactically (immediately before glaucoma surgery, i.e., three episcleral veins cauterization) or as curative treatment (starting at 24 h after glaucoma surgery). The daily regimen of BPC 157 (0.4 µg/eye, 0.4 ng/eye; 10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg) was administered locally as drops in each eye, intraperitoneally (last application at 24 h before sacrifice) or per-orally in drinking water (0.16 µg/mL, 0.16 ng/mL, 12 mL/rat until the sacrifice, first application being intragastric). Consequently, all BPC 157 regimens immediately normalized intraocular pressure. BPC 157-treated rats exhibited normal pupil diameter, microscopically well-preserved ganglion cells and optic nerve presentation, normal fundus presentation, normal retinal and choroidal blood vessel presentation and normal optic nerve presentation. As leading symptoms, increased intraocular pressure and mydriasis, as well as degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, optic nerve head excavation and reduction in optic nerve thickness, generalized severe irregularity of retinal vessels, faint presentation of choroidal vessels and severe optic nerve disc atrophy were all counteracted. In conclusion, we claim that the reversal of the episcleral veins cauterization glaucoma appeared as a consequence of the BPC 157 therapy of the vessel occlusion-induced perilous syndrome."

      "abstract": "Recently, the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was shown to counteract major vessel occlusion syndromes, i.e., peripheral and/or central occlusion, while activating particular collateral pathways. We induced abdominal compartment syndrome (intra-abdominal pressure in thiopental-anesthetized rats at 25 mmHg (60 min), 30 mmHg (30 min), 40 mmHg (30 min), and 50 mmHg (15 min) and in esketamine-anesthetized rats (25 mmHg for 120 min)) as a model of multiple occlusion syndrome. By improving the function of the venous system with BPC 157, we reversed the chain of harmful events. Rats with intra-abdominal hypertension (grade III, grade IV) received BPC 157 (10 µg or 10 ng/kg sc) or saline (5 ml) after 10 min. BPC 157 administration recovered the azygos vein via the inferior-superior caval vein rescue pathway. Additionally, intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval hypertension and aortal hypotension were reduced, as were the grossly congested stomach and major hemorrhagic lesions, brain swelling, venous and arterial thrombosis, congested inferior caval and superior mesenteric veins, and collapsed azygos vein; thus, the failed collateral pathway was fully recovered. Severe ECG disturbances (i.e., severe bradycardia and ST-elevation until asystole) were also reversed. Microscopically, transmural hyperemia of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal mucosa villi reduction, crypt reduction with focal denudation of superficial epithelia, and large bowel dilatation were all inhibited. In the liver, BPC 157 reduced congestion and severe sinusoid enlargement. In the lung, a normal presentation was observed, with no alveolar membrane focal thickening and no lung congestion or edema, and severe intra-alveolar hemorrhage was absent. Moreover, severe heart congestion, subendocardial infarction, renal hemorrhage, brain edema, hemorrhage, and neural damage were prevented. In conclusion, BPC 157 cured primary abdominal compartment syndrome."

Thereby, in this study, we investigated the effect of BPC 157 on the dissection of the quadriceps tendon from the quadriceps muscle in rats. (2) Materials and Methods: Myotendinous junction defect, which cannot heal spontaneously in rats, as evidenced with consistent macro/microscopic, biomechanical, functional assessments, eNOS, and COX-2 mRNA levels and oxidative stress and NO-levels in the myotendinous junctions. BPC 157 (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg) regimen was given (i) intraperitoneally, first application immediately after surgery, last 24 h before sacrifice; (ii) per-orally, in drinking water (0.16 µg/mL, 0.16 ng/mL, 12 mL/rat/day), till the sacrifice at 7, 14, 28 and 42 postoperative days. (3) Results: These BPC 157 regimens document prominent therapy effects (macro/microscopic, biomechanical, functional much like eNOS and COX-2 mRNA levels and counteracted oxidative stress and NO-levels in the myotendinous junctions), while controls have a poor presentation. Especially, in rats with the disabled myotendinous junction, along with full functional recovery, BPC 157 counteracts muscle atrophy that is regularly progressive and brings muscle presentation close to normal. Accordingly, unlike the perilous course in controls, those rats, when receiving BPC 157 therapy, exhibit a smaller defect, and finally defects completely disappear. Microscopically, there are no more inflammatory infiltrate, well-oriented recovered tissue of musculotendon junction appears in BPC 157 treated rats at the 28 days and 42 days. (4) Conclusions: BPC 157 restores myotendinous junction in accordance with the healing of the transected muscle, tendon, and ligament."

      "abstract": "Due to endothelial impairment, high-dose lithium may produce an occlusive-like syndrome, comparable to permanent occlusion of major vessel-induced syndromes in rats; intracranial, portal, and caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension; multi-organ dysfunction syndrome; brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal lesions; arterial and venous thrombosis; and tissue oxidative stress. Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 may be a means of therapy via activating loops (bypassing vessel occlusion) and counteracting major occlusion syndromes. Recently, BPC 157 counteracted the lithium sulfate regimen in rats (500 mg/kg/day, ip, for 3 days, with assessment at 210 min after each administration of lithium) and its severe syndrome (muscular weakness and prostration, reduced muscle fibers, myocardial infarction, and edema of various brain areas). Subsequently, BPC 157 also counteracted the lithium-induced occlusive-like syndrome; rapidly counteracted brain swelling and intracranial (superior sagittal sinus) hypertension, portal hypertension, and aortal hypotension, which otherwise would persist; counteracted vessel failure; abrogated congestion of the inferior caval and superior mesenteric veins; reversed azygos vein failure; and mitigated thrombosis (superior mesenteric vein and artery), congestion of the stomach, and major hemorrhagic lesions. Both regimens of BPC 157 administration also counteracted the previously described muscular weakness and prostration (as shown in microscopic and ECG recordings), myocardial congestion and infarction, in addition to edema and lesions in various brain areas; marked dilatation and central venous congestion in the liver; large areas of congestion and hemorrhage in the lung; and degeneration of proximal and distal tubules with cytoplasmic vacuolization in the kidney, attenuating oxidative stress. Thus, BPC 157 therapy overwhelmed high-dose lithium intoxication in rats."

      "abstract": "The emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak. COVID-19 is largely seen as a thrombotic and vascular disease targeting endothelial cells (ECs) throughout the body that can provoke the breakdown of central vascular functions. This explains the complications and multi-organ failure seen in COVID-19 patients including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular complications, liver damage, and neurological damage. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of COVID-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients. Here we discuss BPC 157, based primarily on animal model data, as a novel agent that can improve the clinical management of COVID-19. BPC 157 is a peptide that has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and endothelial-protective effects in different organ systems in different species. BPC 157 activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is associated with nitric oxide (NO) release, tissue repair and angiomodulatory properties which can lead to improved vascular integrity and immune response, reduced proinflammatory profile, and reduced critical levels of the disease. As a result, discussion of its use as a potential prophylactic and complementary treatment is critical. All examined treatments, although potentiality effective against COVID-19, need either appropriate drug development or clinical trials in humans to be suitable for clinical use."

      "abstract": "We redefined Robert's prototypical cytoprotection model, namely the intragastric administration of 96% alcohol in order to generate a general peripheral and central syndrome similar to that which occurs when major central or peripheral veins are occluded in animal models. With this redefinition, we used Robert's model to examine the cytoprotective effects of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157. The intragastric administration of alcohol induced gastric lesions, intracranial (superior sagittal sinus) hypertension, severe brain swelling and lesions, portal and vena caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, severe thrombosis, inferior vena cava and superior mesenteric vein congestion, azygos vein failure (as a failed collateral pathway), electrocardiogram disturbances, and heart, lung, liver and kidney lesions. The use of BPC 157 therapy (10 µg/kg or 10 ng/kg given intraperitoneally 1 min after alcohol) counteracted these deficits rapidly. Specifically, BPC 157 reversed brain swelling and superior mesenteric vein and inferior vena caval congestion, and helped the azygos vein to recover, which improved the collateral blood flow pathway. Microscopically, BPC 157 counteracted brain (i.e., intracerebral hemorrhage with degenerative changes of cerebral and cerebellar neurons), heart (acute subendocardial infarct), lung (parenchymal hemorrhage), liver (congestion), kidney (congestion) and gastrointestinal (epithelium loss, hemorrhagic gastritis) lesions. In addition, this may have taken place along with the activation of specific molecular pathways. In conclusion, these findings clarify and extend the theory of cytoprotection, offer an approach to its practical application, and establish BPC 157 as a prospective cytoprotective treatment."

Subsequent control fistula course (the subsequent 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks) since beginning revealed the failed healing, fistula leaking, adhesions, urinary leaking through vagina, failed epithelization, collagenization, granulation tissue and neovascularization, increased inflammation, and necrosis. Thereby, the later intervals revealed the persistent inability to sustain even minimal volume, vesical, and vaginal defects and stone formation at the end of the experiment (fistula-time day 56). BPC 157 therapy (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg, intraperitoneally once time daily or perorally in drinking water until sacrifice) was initiated with a considerable delay (at 2 weeks after fistula formation). Already within 1 week therapy, all BPC 157 regimens stopped urinary leaking through vagina, reversed the otherwise resistant poor healing course to the increased epithelization, collagenization, granulation tissue and neovascularization, decreased inflammation, and decreased necrosis. Thereby, at later intervals, all BPC 157 rats exhibited a five times larger volume that can be sustained before leaking as in healthy, vesical, and vaginal defects completely closed and no stone formation. Thus, macro/microscopic and functional recovery, and counteracted stone formation. Concluding, BPC 157 therapy's beneficial effects resulted in healing and no stone formation, with µg- and ng-regimens, either given daily perorally in drinking water or intraperitoneally."

Here, an integrated approach in experimental BPC 157 therapy was implemented, combining laboratory-controlled and field study results. The aim of a study was to assess the effects of BPC 157 additional feeding of newly emerged worker honeybees on few biochemical and immunological parameters in hemolymph (glucose, trehalose, lipids, proteins, vitellogenin, glucose-oxidase (GOX)), and hypopharyngeal gland (HPG), in laboratory-controlled conditions. Additionally, to examine the physiological status of protein digestion, the enzymatic activity of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) in the mid-guts of worker honeybees was analyzed. It was found that individual honeybees, in hoarding cages, following BPC 157 administration through carbohydrate food, showed positive physiological changes when compared to the control groups. Those results were complemented by strong and visible LAP activity, particularly noticeable in the apical parts of the epithelial cells in the mid-guts of young worker honeybees originated from treated hives, suggesting a link between alternative oral therapy with BPC 157 and honeybees' immunity."

Gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy in rats compensated irremovable occlusion of various vessels and counteracted the consequent multiorgan dysfunction syndromes by activation of the corresponding collateral bypassing loops. Thus, we used BPC 157 therapy against the irremovable occlusion of the end of the superior mesenteric vein. Methods. Assessments, for 30 min (gross recording, venography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry, and oxidative stress) include the portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, and centrally, the superior sagittal sinus hypertension, systemic arterial and venous thrombosis, ECG disturbances, MDA-tissue increase, and heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, and brain (cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus) lesions. Rats received BPC 157 medication (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 or 15 min ligation time. Results. BPC 157 rapidly activated the superior mesenteric vein-inferior anterior pancreati-coduodenal vein-superior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein-pyloric vein-portal vein pathway, reestablished superior mesenteric vein and portal vein connection and reestablished blood flow. Simultaneously, toward inferior caval vein, an additional pathway appears via the inferior mesenteric vein united with the middle colic vein, throughout its left colic branch to ascertain alternative bypassing blood flow. Consequently, BPC 157 acts peripherally and centrally, and counteracted the intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, ECG disturbances attenuated, abolished progressing venous and arterial thrombosis. Additionally, BPC 157 counteracted multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, and brain lesions, and oxidative stress in tissues. Conclusion. BPC 157 therapy may be specific management also for the superior mesenteric vein injuries."

      "abstract": "We reviewed the pleiotropic beneficial effects of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, three very recent demonstrations that may be essential in the gut-brain and brain-gut axis operation, and therapy application in the central nervous system disorders, in particular. Firstly, given in the reperfusion, BPC 157 counteracted bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries-induced stroke, sustained brain neuronal damages were resolved in rats as well as disturbed memory, locomotion, and coordination. This therapy effect supports particular gene expression in hippocampal tissues that appeared in BPC 157-treated rats. Secondly, there are L-NG-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)- and haloperidol-induced catalepsy as well as the rat acute and chronic models of 'positive-like' schizophrenia symptoms, that BPC 157 counteracted, and resolved the complex relationship of the nitric oxide-system with amphetamine and apomorphine (dopamine agents application), MK-801 (non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) and chronic methamphetamine administration (to induce sensitivity). Thirdly, after rat spinal cord compression, there were advanced healing and functional recovery (counteracted tail paralysis). Likewise, in BPC 157 therapy, there is specific support for each of these topics: counteracted encephalopathies; alleviated vascular occlusion disturbances (stroke); counteracted dopamine disturbances (dopamine receptors blockade, receptors super sensitivity development, or receptor activation, over-release, nigrostriatal damage, vesicles depletion), and nitric oxide-system disturbances (\"L-NAME non-responsive, L-arginine responsive,\" and \"L-NAME responsive, L-arginine responsive\") (schizophrenia therapy); inflammation reduction, nerve recovery in addition to alleviated hemostasis and vessels function after compression (spinal cord injury therapy). Thus, these disturbances may be all resolved within the same agent's beneficial activity, i.e., the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157."

      "abstract": "Background. Monocrotaline selectively injures the lung's vascular endothelium and induces pulmonary arterial hypertension. The stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 acts as a prototype cytoprotective agent that maintains endothelium, and its application may be a novel therapy. Besides, BPC 157 prevents and reverses thrombosis formation, maintains platelet function, alleviates peripheral vascular occlusion disturbances, and has anti-arrhythmic and anti-inflammatory effects. Monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats (wall thickness, total vessel area, heart frequency, QRS axis deviation, QT interval prolongation, increase in right ventricle systolic pressure and bodyweight loss) can be counteracted with early or delayed BPC 157 therapy. Methods and Results. After monocrotaline (80 mg/kg subcutaneously), BPC 157 (10 μg/kg or 10 ng/kg, days 1-14 or days 1-30 (early regimens), or days 14-30 (delayed regimen)) was given once daily intraperitoneally (last application 24 h before sacrifice) or continuously in drinking water until sacrifice (day 14 or 30). Without therapy, the outcome was the full monocrotaline syndrome, marked by right-side heart hypertrophy and massive thickening of the precapillary artery's smooth muscle layer, clinical deterioration, and sometimes death due to pulmonary hypertension and right-heart failure during the 4th week after monocrotaline injection. With all BPC 157 regimens, monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (including all disturbed parameters) was counteracted, and consistent beneficial effects were documented during the whole course of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension was not even developed (early regimens) as quickly as the advanced pulmonary hypertension was rapidly attenuated and then completely eliminated (delayed regimen). Conclusions. Thus, pentadecapeptide BPC 157 prevents and counteracts monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension and cor pulmonale in rats."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We investigated the occluded essential vessel tributaries, both arterial and venous, occluded superior mesenteric vein and artery in rats, consequent noxious syndrome, peripherally and centrally. As therapy, we hypothesized the rapidly activated alternative bypassing pathways, arterial and venous, and the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 since it rapidly alleviated venous occlusion syndromes. METHODS: Assessments were performed for 30 min (gross recording, venography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry, and oxidative stress), including portal hypertension, caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, and centrally, the superior sagittal sinus hypertension; systemic arterial and venous thrombosis, ECG disturbances, MDA-tissue increase, the multiple organs lesions, heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, including brain (swelling, and cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus lesions). Rats received BPC 157 medication (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 min ligation-time. RESULTS: BPC 157 rapidly activated collateral pathways. These collateral loops were the superior mesenteric vein-inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein-superior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein-pyloric vein-portal vein pathway, an alternative pathway toward inferior caval vein via the united middle colic vein and inferior mesenteric vein through the left colic vein, and the inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior mesenteric artery. Consequently, BPC 157 counteracted the superior sagittal sinus, portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, progressing venous and arterial thrombosis peripherally and centrally, ECG disturbances attenuated. Markedly, the multiple organs lesions, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, as well as brain lesions, and oxidative stress in tissues were attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: BPC 157 therapy rapidly recovered rats, which have complete occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein and artery."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Knee pain, a common complaint in primary care, has many causes, the most common of which is osteoarthritis (OA). Other common causes are meniscus tears, tendinosis, ligament tears or sprains, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and septic arthritis. Also, referred pain from hip joint pathology like slipped capital femoral epiphysis can result in knee pain.1 The use of peptides BPC157 and thymosin-beta-4 (TB4) has not been studied in the treatment of knee pain. METHODS: A retrospective study was done at the Institute for Hormonal Balance in Orlando, Florida, USA to see whether intra-articular injection of the peptide BPC 157, alone or combined with TB4, helped relieve knee pain. A 1-year chart review from 2019 to 2020 was performed. Since this was a retrospective study, patient follow-up varied, with most patients having had an injection of peptide into their knee 6 months to 1 year prior to the study. Of the 17 patients in the study, 16 were contacted by phone to follow up on the status of their knee pain. Only 1 patient could not be reached for the survey. Patients were asked to rate their pain prior to injection, the length of time the peptides helped ease the pain and the degree to which the injection helped them. No specific tools were used to measure their improvement in function, quality of life, stiffness or activities of daily living. The survey's main goal was to determine whether BPC157 helped with multiple types of knee pain in a primary care setting. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients, 12 had received only BPC 157 as an intra-articular injection. In this group, 11 of the 12 patients (91.6%) had significant improvement in knee pain, whereas 1 patient (8.3 %) had no improvement. The other 4 patients received a combination of 2 peptide injections of BPC 157 and TB4. Of the patients who received both peptides, 75% showed significant improvement, but 25% had no relief of their knee pain. Overall, 14 of 16 patients (87.5%) had relief of their knee pain when BPC 157 or a combination of BPC 157 and TB4 was used. CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that intra-articular injection of BPC-157 helps with multiple types of knee pain. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: BPC157 is a peptide with regenerative properties that can be used to relieve multiple types of knee pain.2,3 Future studies are needed to look at the different causes of knee pain with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) to document the peptide's benefits. BPC157 has the potential to repair tears, build cartilage and reduce the number of knee surgeries. Because of its reparative properties, treatment with BPC157 offers advantages over the use of steroids.

      "abstract": "Significance: The antiulcer peptide, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (previously employed in ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis trials, no reported toxicity (LD1 not achieved)), is reviewed, focusing on the particular skin wound therapy, incisional/excisional wound, deep burns, diabetic ulcers, and alkali burns, which may be generalized to the other tissues healing. Recent Advances: BPC 157 has practical applicability (given alone, with the same dose range, and same equipotent routes of application, regardless the injury tested). Critical Issues: By simultaneously curing cutaneous and other tissue wounds (colocutaneous, gastrocutaneous, esophagocutaneous, duodenocutaneous, vesicovaginal, and rectovaginal) in rats, the potency of BPC 157 is evident. Healing of the wounds is accomplished by resolution of vessel constriction, the primary platelet plug, the fibrin mesh which acts to stabilize the platelet plug, and resolution of the clot. Thereby, BPC 157 is effective in wound healing much like it is effective in counteracting bleeding disorders, produced by amputation, and/or anticoagulants application. Likewise, BPC 157 may prevent and/or attenuate or eliminate, thus, counteract both arterial and venous thrombosis. Then, confronted with obstructed vessels, there is circumvention of the occlusion, which may be the particular action of BPC 157 in ischemia/reperfusion. Future Directions: BPC 157 rapidly increases various genes expression in rat excision skin wound. This would define the healing in the other tissues, that is, gastrointestinal tract, tendon, ligament, muscle, bone, nerve, spinal cord, cornea (maintained transparency), and blood vessels, seen with BPC 157 therapy."

      "abstract": "We show the complex syndrome of the occluded superior sagittal sinus, brain swelling and lesions and multiple peripheral organs lesions in rat. Recovery goes centrally and peripherally, with the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, which alleviated peripheral vascular occlusion disturbances, rapidly activating alternative bypassing pathways. Assessments were gross recording, venography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry. The increased pressure in the superior sagittal sinus, portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, arterial and venous thrombosis, severe brain swelling and lesions (cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus), particular veins (azygos, superior mesenteric, inferior caval) dysfunction, heart dysfunction, lung congestion as acute respiratory distress syndrome, kidney disturbances, liver failure, and hemorrhagic lesions in gastrointestinal tract were all assessed. Rats received BPC 157 medication (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg) intraperitoneally, intragastrically, or topically to the swollen brain at 1 min ligation-time, or at 15 min, 24 h and 48 h ligation-time. BPC 157 therapy rapidly attenuates the brain swelling, rapidly eliminates the increased pressure in the ligated superior sagittal sinus and the severe portal and caval hypertension and aortal hypotension, and rapidly recruits collateral vessels, centrally ((para)sagittal venous collateral circulation) and peripherally (left superior caval vein azygos vein-inferior caval vein). In conclusion, as shown by all assessments, BPC 157 acts against the permanent occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus and syndrome (i.e., brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal lesions, thrombosis), given at 1 min, 15 min, 24 h or 48 h ligation-time. BPC 157 therapy rapidly overwhelms the permanent occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus in rat."

      "abstract": "Providing NO-system importance, we suggest that one single application of the NOS-blocker L-NAME may induce retinal ischemia in rats, and that the stable pentadecapeptide BPC 157 may be the therapy, since it may interact with the NO-system and may counteract various adverse effects of L-NAME application. A rat retinal ischemia study was conducted throughout 4 weeks, including fundoscopy, behavior presentation, tonometry, and histology assessment. Retrobulbar L-NAME application (5 mg/kg; 0.5 mg/0.1 ml saline/each eye) in rats immediately produced moderate generalized irregularity in the diameter of blood vessels with moderate atrophy of the optic disc and faint presentation of the choroidal blood vessels, and these lesions rapidly progressed to the severe stage. The specific L-NAME-induced vascular failure points to normal intraocular pressure (except to very transitory increase upon drug retrobulbar administration). When BPC 157 (10 μg; 10 ng/kg, as retrobulbar application, 1 μg; 1 ng/0.1 ml saline/each eye) is given at either 20 min after L-NAME or, lately, at 48 h after L-NAME, the regular retrobulbar L-NAME injection findings disappear. Instead, fundoscopy demonstrated only discrete generalized vessel caliber irregularity with mild atrophy of the optic disc, and then, quite rapidly, normal eye background and choroidal blood vessels, which remain in all of the subsequent periods. Also, histology assessment at 1, 2, and 4 weeks shows that BPC 157 counteracted the damaged inner plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer, and revealed normal retinal thickness. The poor behavioral presentation was also rescued. Thus, while further studies will be done, BPC 157 counteracted L-NAME-induced rat retinal ischemia."

      "abstract": "Gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy counteracts multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in rats, which have permanent occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery close to the abdominal aorta. Previously, when confronted with major vessel occlusion, its effect would rapidly activate collateral vessel pathways and resolve major venous occlusion syndromes (Pringle maneuver ischemia, reperfusion, Budd-Chiari syndrome) in rats. This would overwhelm superior mesenteric artery permanent occlusion, and result in local, peripheral, and central disturbances. Methods: Assessments, for 30 min (gross recording, angiography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry, and oxidative stress), included the portal hypertension, caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension, and centrally, the superior sagittal sinus hypertension; systemic arterial and venous thrombosis; ECG disturbances; MDA-tissue increase; and multiple organ lesions and disturbances, including the heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, as well as brain (cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus). BPC 157 therapy (/kg, abdominal bath) (10 µg, 10 ng) was given for a 1-min ligation time. Results: BPC 157 rapidly recruits collateral vessels (inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior mesenteric artery) that circumvent occlusion and ascertains blood flow distant from the occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery. Portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, and, centrally, superior sagittal sinus hypertension were attenuated or eliminated, and ECG disturbances markedly mitigated. BPC 157 therapy almost annihilated venous and arterial thrombosis. Multiple organ lesions and disturbances (i.e., heart, lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, as well as brain) were largely attenuated. Conclusions: Rats with superior mesenteric artery occlusion may additionally undergo BPC 157 therapy as full counteraction of vascular occlusion-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome."

      "abstract": "AIM: Although Clopidogrel is safe in healthy volunteers, it can induce recurrence of gastric ulcers in high-risk patients. Here, we investigated the protective effect of the natural product, stable gastric pentadecapeptide 157 (BPC 157) on Clopidogrel-induced gastric injury. METHODS: We used acetic acid to induce gastric ulcer in Sprague Dawley rats. Clopidogrel alone or in combination with BPC 157 or L-NAME (nitric oxide system blockade) were administered after healing of acetic acid-induced ulcer. One percent methylcellulose solution was used as control. Ulcer recurrence rate and the ulcer index were compared between these groups. Gastric mucosal apoptosis rate, microscopic inflammation activity and angiogenesis markers vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and CD34 were examined by TUNEL, histological evaluations (HE) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Pathways involved, expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptosis marker CHOP, angiogenic markers VEGF-A and its receptor VEGFR1, and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) were all analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: This study indicated that Clopidogrel significantly induced the gastric ulcers recurrence, severe inflammation and ER stress related apoptosis of the gastric mucosa, suppressed the synthesis of angiogenic markers and eNOS. Furthermore, Clopidrogel intervention resulted in the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38/MAPK). BPC 157 attenuated the gastric mucosal damage caused by Clopidogrel and reversed these molecular effects. However, NO blockade L-NAME weakened the protective effect and thus the molecular effects of BPC 157 on gastric mucosa. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these results suggest that BPC 157 inhibited Clopidogrel-induced gastric mucosa injury partially by inhibition of gastric mucosa cell ER stress-mediated apoptosis and inflammation, and promoting gastric mucosa angiogenesis via VEGF-A/VEGFR1 mediated-AKT/p38/MAPK signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: After parietal peritoneum excision with an underlying superficial layer of muscle tissue in rats, there is failed vasculature, and finally, increased adhesion formation. We hypothesized that unlike nitric oxide (NO)-agents, L-NAME and/or L-arginine, the application of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 with its most recent vascular effects (\"vascular recruitment\") means attenuated bowel adhesion formation and NO- and malondialdehyde (MDA)-tissue values. AIM: To focused on the bowel adhesion and the therapy with the BPC 157, its most and application of NO-agents. METHODS: Along with defect creation, medication was (1) during surgery, once, at 1 min after defect creation as an abdominal bath (1 mL/rat), BPC 157 (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg, 1 mL/rat), an equivolume of saline, L-NAME (5 mg/kg), L-arginine (200 mg/kg) alone and/or combined. Alternatively, medication was (2) intraperitoneally once daily, first application at 30 min after surgery, last application 24 h before assessment at d 7 or d 14. As a postponed therapy to pre-existing adhesion (3), BPC 157 (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg intraperitoneally, 1 mL/rat) was given once daily since d 7. RESULTS: The recovery effect of the BPC 157 regimens goes with the presence of abundant vascular vessels in and near the defect, which occurs rapidly. Lastly, also applied as post-treatment, BPC 157 creates attenuated adhesions, minimal or no adhesion. Contrarily, NO-agents have diverse initial and final effects: The initial weakening of blood vessel disappearance and finally, severe worsening of adhesions (L-NAME) vs the initial weakening of blood vessel disappearance and finally, attenuation of adhesions formation (L-arginine), which counteract each other response given together. Importantly, BPC 157 maintains its beneficial effect also when given with NO-agents (L-NAME + BC 157; L-arginine + BPC 157; L-NAME + L-arginine + BPC 157). Finally, with respect to the increased NO- and MDA- values-adhesion tissue formation relation, unlike diverse effect of the NO-agents, the BPC 157 application effect regularly combines decrease on the increased NO- and MDA- values and the beneficial outcome (less adhesion formation). CONCLUSION: BPC 157 therapy can be suited for the realization of the peritoneal defect healing with minimal or no adhesion formation."

The background is the proven therapy effect of BPC 157 in ischemia/reperfusion injuries in different tissues. Furthermore, there is the subsequent oxidative stress counteraction, particularly when given during reperfusion. The recovering effect it has on occluded vessels, results with activation of the alternative pathways, bypassing the occlusion in deep vein thrombosis. Finally, the BPC 157 therapy benefits with its proposed role as a novel mediator of Roberts' cytoprotection and bidirectional effects in the gut-brain axis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries for a 20-min period. At 30 s thereafter, we applied medication (BPC 157 10 µg/kg; or saline) as a 1 ml bath directly to the operated area, that is, trigonum caroticum. We documented, in reperfusion, the resolution of the neuronal damages sustained in the brain, resolution of the damages reflected in memory, locomotion, and coordination disturbances, with the presentation of the particular genes expression in hippocampal tissues. RESULTS: In the operated rats, at 24 and 72 hr of the reperfusion, the therapy counteracted both early and delayed neural hippocampal damage, achieving full functional recovery (Morris water maze test, inclined beam-walking test, lateral push test). mRNA expression studies at 1 and 24 hr, provided strongly elevated (Egr1, Akt1, Kras, Src, Foxo, Srf, Vegfr2, Nos3, and Nos1) and decreased (Nos2, Nfkb) gene expression (Mapk1 not activated), as a way how BPC 157 may act. CONCLUSION: Together, these findings suggest that these beneficial BPC 157 effects may provide a novel therapeutic solution for stroke.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Pringle maneuver [portal triad obstruction(PTO)] provides huge disturbances during ischemia and even more thereafter in reperfusion. Contrarily, a possible solution may be stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, with already documented beneficial effects in ischemia/reperfusion conditions. Recently, BPC 157, as a cytoprotective agent, successfully resolved vessel occlusions in rats (ischemic colitis; deep vein thrombosis, superior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein; bile duct cirrhosis) through rapid collateral vessel recruitment to circumvent vessel occlusion. Thereby, medication BPC 157 regimens were administered as a single challenge before and during ischemia or, alternatively, at various time points during reperfusion. AIM: To introduce BPC 157 therapy against pringle maneuver-damage. METHODS: In deeply anesthetised rats, the portal triad was clamped up for 30 min. Rats then underwent reperfusion for either 15 min or 24 h. Medication [(10 µg, 10 ng/kg) regimens, administered as a single challenge] picked (a) ischemia, PTO period [at 5 min before (ip) or at 5 or 30 min of ligation time (as a bath to PTO)] or (b) reperfusion, post-PTO period [at 1 or 15 min (bath during surgery) or 24 h (ip) reperfusion-time]. We provided gross, microscopy, malondialdehyde, serum enzymes, electrocardiogram, portal, caval, and aortal pressure, thrombosis and venography assessments. RESULTS: BPC 157 counteracts electrocardiogram disturbances (increased P wave amplitude, S1Q3T3 QRS pattern and tachycardia). Rapidly presented vascular pathway (portal vein-superior mesenteric vein-inferior mesenteric vein-rectal veins-left ileal vein-inferior caval vein) as the adequate shunting immediately affected disturbed haemodynamics. Portal hypertension and severe aortal hypotension during PTO, as well as portal and caval hypertension and mild aortal hypotension in reperfusion and refractory ascites formation were markedly attenuated (during PTO) or completely abrogated (reperfusion); thrombosis in portal vein tributaries and inferior caval vein or hepatic artery was counteracted during portal triad obstruction PTO. Also, counteraction included the whole vicious injurious circle [i.e., lung pathology (severe capillary congestion), liver (dilated central veins and terminal portal venules), intestine (substantial capillary congestion, submucosal oedema, loss of villous architecture), splenomegaly, right heart (picked P wave values)] regularly perpetuated in ischemia and progressed by reperfusion in Pringle rats. CONCLUSION: BPC 157 resolves pringle maneuver-damage in rats, both for ischemia and reperfusion."

      "abstract": "This review is focused on the healing of fistulas and stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157. Assuming that the healing of the various wounds is essential also for the gastrointestinal fistulas healing, the healing effect on fistulas in rats, consistently noted with the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, may raise several interesting possibilities. BPC 157 is originally an anti-ulcer agent, native to and stable in human gastric juice (for more than 24 h). Likely, it is a novel mediator of Robert's cytoprotection maintaining gastrointestinal mucosal integrity. Namely, it is effective in the whole gastrointestinal tract, and heals various wounds (i.e., skin, muscle, tendon, ligament, bone; ulcers in the entire gastrointestinal tract; corneal ulcer); LD1 is not achieved. It is used in ulcerative colitis clinical trials, and now in multiple sclerosis, and addressed in several reviews. Therefore, it is not surprising that BPC 157 has documented consistent healing of the various gastrointestinal fistulas, external (esophagocutaneous, gastrocutaneous, duodenocutaneous, colocutaneous) and internal (colovesical, rectovaginal). Taking fistulas as a pathological connection, this rescue is verified with the beneficial effects in rats with the various gastrointestinal anastomoses, esophagogastric, jejunoileal, colo-colonic, ileoileal, esophagojejunal, esophagoduodenal, and gastrojejunal. This beneficial effect occurs equally when the gastrointestinal anastomoses are impaired with the application of NSAIDs, cysteamine, large bowel resection, as well as concomitant esophageal, gastric, and duodenal lesions and/or ulcerative colitis presentation, short bowel syndrome progression, liver and brain disturbances presentation. Particular aspects of the BPC 157 healing of the fistulas are especially emphasized.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, as a possible therapy resolving solution, pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy, has been used in alleviating various vascular occlusion disturbances. BPC 157 was previously reviewed as novel mediator of Robert cytoprotection and endothelium protection in the stomach, and gut-brain axis, beneficial therapy in gastrointestinal tract, with particular reference to vascular recruitment, ulcerative colitis and tumor cachexia, and other tissues healing. Here we raised new hypothesis about BPC 157 therapy in the Budd-Chiari syndrome in rats, rapid bypassing of the suprahepatic inferior caval vein occlusion, and rats recovery with the active and effective pharmacotherapy treatment. AIM: To investigate Budd-Chiari syndrome model (inferior caval vein suprahepatic occlusion) resolution, since BPC 157 resolves various rat vascular occlusion. METHODS: We assessed the activated bypassing pathways between the inferior and superior caval veins and portocaval shunt, counteracted caval/portal hypertension, aortal hypotension, venous/arterial thrombosis, electrocardiogram disturbances, liver and gastrointestinal lesions (i.e., stomach and duodenum hemorrhages, in particular, congestion). Rats with suprahepatic occlusion of the inferior vena cava by ligation were medicated at 1 min, 15 min, 24 h, or 48 h post-ligation. Medication consisted of 10 µg/kg BPC 157, 10 ng BPC 157 or 5 mL/kg saline, administered once as an abdominal bath or intragastric application. Gross and microscopic observations were made, in addition to assessments of electrical activity of the heart (electrocardiogram), portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, thrombosis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and venography. Furthermore, levels of nitric oxide, malondialdehyde in the liver and serum enzymes were determined. RESULTS: BPC 157 counteracted increased P wave amplitude, tachycardia and ST-elevation, i.e., right heart failure from acute thrombotic coronary occlusion. The bypassing pathway of the inferior vena cava-azygos (hemiazygos) vein-superior vena cava and portocaval shunt occurred rapidly. Even with severe caval ˃ portal hypertension, BPC 157 antagonized portal and caval hypertension and aortal hypotension, and also reduced refractory ascites. Thrombosis of portal vein tributaries, inferior vena cava, and hepatic and coronary arteries was attenuated. In addition, there was reduced pathology of the lungs (severe capillary congestion) and liver (dilated central veins and terminal portal venules), decreased intestine hemorrhagic lesions (substantial capillary congestion, submucosal edema and architecture loss), and increased liver and spleen weight. During the period of ligation, nitric oxide- and malondialdehyde-levels in the liver remained within normal healthy values, and increases in serum enzymes were markedly reduced. CONCLUSION: BPC 157 counteracts Budd Chiari syndrome in rats."

      "abstract": "We suggest that the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 may rescue thrombocyte function. We focused on the antithrombotic agent aspirin, clopidogrel, and cilostazol application in rats; arachidonic acid, ADP, collagen, and arachidonic acid/PGE1 platelet aggregation (aggregometry) and blood clot viscoelastic properties (thromboelastometry); and the pentadecapeptide BPC 157. Rats received intragastrically for three days once daily treatment with antithrombotic agents-aspirin (10 mg/kg) or clopidogrel (10 mg/kg) or cilostazol (10 mg/kg). Medication (BPC 157 (10 μg/kg) or an equal volume of saline (5 ml/kg)) was given intragastrically, immediately after each antithrombotic agent application. For multiple electrode aggregometry and modified rotational thromboelastometry studies, blood sampling was at 2 h after last application. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP test 6.5 μM), arachidonic acid (ASPI test 0.5 mM), a combination of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E1 (ASPI test 0.5 mM and PGE1-test 30 nM), and collagen (COL test 3.2 μg/ml) were used as aggregation agonists. Given with aspirin, clopidogrel, or cilostazol in rats, BPC 157 counteracted their inhibitory effects on aggregation activated by arachidonic acid, ADP, collagen, and arachidonic acid/PGE1. Specifically, this includes recovery of the aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (vs. aspirin, vs. clopidogrel, and vs. cilostazol), arachidonic acid/PGE1 (vs. cilostazol), ADP (vs. clopidogrel), or collagen (vs. clopidogrel). Contrarily, there is no effect on the used tests (extrinsic/intrinsic hemostasis system, the fibrin part of the clot) EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM; clotting time; clot formation time; alpha-angle; maximum clot firmness; lysis index after 30 minutes; and maximum lysis. In conclusion, we revealed that BPC 157 largely rescues thrombocyte function.",

      "abstract": "We focused on the cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis (100 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally throughout three days) as a particular NO-system disturbance, and therapy possibilities. We demonstrated that it may be attenuated by subsequent administration of the NOS substrate L-arginine (100 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally), aggravated by NOS-blocker L-NAME (5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally), all influenced by the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (10 μg/kg/day, 10 ng/kg/day, intraperitoneally or perorally, in drinking water). Regularly, cyclophosphamide dose- and time-dependently induced severe hemorrhagic cystitis lesions, gross lesions, and corresponding urothelial necrosis, vesical edema, erosion, hemorrhage, inflammation, and ulceration, microscopically. The bladder wet weight dramatically increased. Functionally, already after first cyclophosphamide administration, there is an increased leak point pressure. Until the second cyclophosphamide administration, L-arginine consistently attenuated regular cyclophosphamide-induced severe hemorrhagic cystitis lesions, grossly and microscopically, but not functionally. L-NAME aggravated these lesions and eradicated beneficial effect of L-arginine when combined. BPC 157 administration after cyclophosphamide, given in either dose or in either regimen markedly attenuated all cyclophosphamide lesions, grossly, microscopically. The increase of the bladder wet weight was consistently attenuated. Functionally, increased leak point pressure was reversed to the values noted in normal rats. The similar findings were noted in rats that received BPC 157 together with L-NAME or L-arginine, given alone or combined. Thus, the lesions are NO-related based on the administration of L-NAME as well as administration of L-arginine, and their mutual interaction, and counteraction by BPC 157 application. Likewise, we reveal new therapeutic possibilities, emphasizing stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 and L-arginine, versus L-NAME in rats underwent cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We focused on the therapeutic effects of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 in spinal cord injury using a rat model. BPC 157, of which the LD1 has not been achieved, has been implemented as an anti-ulcer peptide in inflammatory bowel disease trials and recently in a multiple sclerosis trial. In animals, BPC 157 has an anti-inflammatory effect and therapeutic effects in functional recovery and the rescue of somatosensory neurons in the sciatic nerve after transection, upon brain injury after concussive trauma, and in severe encephalopathies. Additionally, BPC 157 affects various molecular pathways. METHODS: Therefore, BPC 157 therapy was administered by a one-time intraperitoneal injection (BPC 157 (200 or 2 μg/kg) or 0.9% NaCl (5 ml/kg)) 10 min after injury. The injury procedure involved laminectomy (level L2-L3) and a 60-s compression (neurosurgical piston (60-66 g) of the exposed dural sac of the sacrocaudal spinal cord). Assessments were performed at 1, 4, 7, 15, 30, 90, 180, and 360 days after injury. RESULTS: All of the injured rats that received BPC 157 exhibited consistent clinical improvement, increasingly better motor function of the tail, no autotomy, and resolved spasticity by day 15. BPC 157 application largely counteracted changes at the microscopic level, including the formation of vacuoles and the loss of axons in the white matter, the formation of edema and the loss of motoneurons in the gray matter, and a decreased number of large myelinated axons in the rat caudal nerve from day 7. EMG recordings showed a markedly lower motor unit potential in the tail muscle. CONCLUSION: Axonal and neuronal necrosis, demyelination, and cyst formation were counteracted. The functional rescue provided by BPC 157 after spinal cord injury implies that BPC 157 therapy can impact all stages of the secondary injury phase.",

      "abstract": "We reviewed again the significance of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 as a likely mediator of Robert's stomach cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection and organoprotection and as novel mediator of Selye's stress coping response to reestablish homeostasis. Specific points of BPC 157 therapy and the original concept of Robert's cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection/organoprotection are discussed, including the beneficial effects of BPC 157. First, BPC 157 protects stomach cells and maintains gastric integrity against various noxious agents (Robert's killing cell by contact) and is continuously present in the gastric mucosa and gastric juice. Additionally, BPC 157 protects against the adverse effects of alcohol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the gastric epithelium and other epithelia, that is, skin, liver, pancreas, heart (organoprotection), and brain, thereby suggesting its use in wound healing. Additionally, BPC 157 counteracts gastric endothelial injury that precedes and induces damage to the gastric epithelium and generalizes \"gastric endothelial protection\" to protection of the endothelium of other vessels (thrombosis, prolonged bleeding, and thrombocytopenia). BPC 157 also has an effect on blood vessels, resulting in vessel recruitment that circumvents vessel occlusion and the development of additional shunting and rapid bypass loops to rapidly reestablish the integrity of blood flow (ischemic/reperfusion colitis, duodenal lesions, cecal perforation, and inferior vena caval occlusion). Lastly, BPC 157 counteracts tumor cachexia, muscle wasting, and increases in pro-inflammatory/procachectic cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and significantly corrects deranged muscle proliferation and myogenesis through changes in the expression of FoxO3a, p-AKT, p-mTOR, and p-GSK-3β (mitigating cancer cachexia).",

      "abstract": "There is a current need for a therapy that can alleviate the social and economic burden that presents itself with debilitating and recurring musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries and disorders. Currently, several therapies are emerging and undergoing trials in animal models; these focus on the manipulation and administration of several growth factors implicated with healing. However, limitations include in vivo instability, reliance on biocompatible and robust carriers and restricted application procedures (local and direct). The aim of this paper is therefore to critically review the current literature surrounding the use of BPC 157, as a feasible therapy for healing and functional restoration of soft tissue damage, with a focus on tendon, ligament and skeletal muscle healing. Currently, all studies investigating BPC 157 have demonstrated consistently positive and prompt healing effects for various injury types, both traumatic and systemic and for a plethora of soft tissues. However, to date, the majority of studies have been performed on small rodent models and the efficacy of BPC 157 is yet to be confirmed in humans. Further, over the past two decades, only a handful of research groups have performed in-depth studies regarding this peptide. Despite this, it is apparent that BPC 157 has huge potential and following further development has promise as a therapy to conservatively treat or aid recovery in hypovascular and hypocellular soft tissues such as tendon and ligaments. Moreover, skeletal muscle injury models have suggested a beneficial effect not only for disturbances that occur as a result of direct trauma but also for systemic insults including hyperkalamia and hypermagnesia. Promisingly, there are few studies reporting any adverse reactions to the administration of BPC 157, although there is still a need to understand the precise healing mechanisms for this therapy to achieve clinical realisation.",

      "abstract": "Recently, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 reversed the high MDA- and NO-tissue values to the healthy levels. Thereby, BPC 157 therapy cured rats with bile duct ligation (BDL) (sacrifice at 2, 4, 6, 8 week). BPC 157-medication (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg) was continuously in drinking water (0.16 μg/ml, 0.16 ng/ml, 12 ml/rat/day) since awakening from surgery, or since week 4. Intraperitoneal administration was first at 30 min post-ligation, last at 24 h before sacrifice. Local bath BPC 157 (10 µg/kg) with assessed immediate normalization of portal hypertension was given immediately after establishing portal hypertension values at 4, 6, 8 week. BPC 157 therapy markedly abated jaundice, snout, ears, paws, and yellow abdominal tegmentum in controls since 4th week, ascites, nodular, steatotic liver with large dilatation of main bile duct, increased liver and/or cyst weight, decreased body weight. BPC 157 counteracts the piecemeal necrosis, focal lytic necrosis, apoptosis and focal inflammation, disturbed cell proliferation (Ki-67-staining), cytoskeletal structure in the hepatic stellate cell (α-SMA staining), collagen presentation (Mallory staining). Likewise, counteraction includes increased AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, total bilirubin, direct and indirect and decreased albumin serum levels. As the end-result appear normalized MDA- and NO-tissue values, next to Western blot of NOS2 and NOS3 in the liver tissue, and decreased IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β levels in liver tissue. Finally, although portal hypertension is sustained in BDL-rats, with BPC 157 therapy, portal hypertension in BDL-rats is either not even developed or rapidly abated, depending on the given BPC 157's regimen. Thus, BPC 157 may counteract liver fibrosis and portal hypertension.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To investigate whether duodenal lesions induced by major venous occlusions can be attenuated by BPC 157 regardless nitric oxide (NO) system involvement. METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent superior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein (SAPDV)-ligation and were treated with a bath at the ligated SAPDV site (BPC 157 10 μg, 10 ng/kg per 1 mL bath/rat; L-NAME 5 mg/kg per 1 mL bath/rat; L-arginine 100 mg/kg per 1 mL bath/rat, alone and/or together; or BPC 157 10 μg/kg instilled into the rat stomach, at 1 min ligation-time). We recorded the vessel presentation (filled/appearance or emptied/disappearance) between the 5 arcade vessels arising from the SAPDV on the ventral duodenum side, the inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein (IAPDV) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) as bypassing vascular pathway to document the duodenal lesions presentation; increased NO- and oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA)]-levels in duodenum. RESULTS: Unlike the severe course in the SAPDV-ligated controls, after BPC 157 application, the rats exhibited strong attenuation of the mucosal lesions and serosal congestion, improved vessel presentation, increased interconnections, increased branching by more than 60% from the initial value, the IAPDV and SMV were not congested. Interestingly, after 5 min and 30 min of L-NAME and L-arginine treatment alone, decreased mucosal and serosal duodenal lesions were observed; their effect was worsened at 24 h, and no effect on the collateral vessels and branching was seen. Together, L-NAME+L-arginine antagonized each other's response, and thus, there was an NO-related effect. With BPC 157, all SAPDV-ligated rats receiving L-NAME and/or L-arginine appeared similar to the rats treated with BPC 157 alone. Also, BPC 157 in SAPDV-ligated rats normalized levels of NO and MDA, two oxidative stress markers, in duodenal tissues. CONCLUSION: BPC 157, rapidly bypassing occlusion, rescued the original duodenal flow through IAPDV to SMV flow, an effect related to the NO system and reduction of free radical formation.",

      "abstract": "With intra(per)-oral strong alcohol application at the tongue, swallowed, we renewed Robert's stomach cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection concept. We assessed strong (96%) alcohol-induced severe or minute lesions in stomach, tongue-esophagus-stomach-duodenum lesions, and sphincter pressure (lower esophageal and pyloric) upon administration intragastrically (at 1 h) or intra(per)-orally at the tongue, and swallowed (at 1, 5, 15, 30 min; and 1, 2, 24 h). The assessment also included combined administrations (intra(per)-oral at the tongue, swallowed and intragastric (at 1 h)). Immediate post-alcohol intraperitoneal medication (mg/kg) was the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (0.01, 0.00001; a Robert's cytoprotection mediator; with a therapeutic effect), NOS-blocker L-NAME (5), and NOS-substrate L-arginine (100 mg), (NO-system involvement). After intragastric strong alcohol administration, severe stomach ulcerations appeared along with widespread tongue, esophagus, duodenum redness, and minimal sphincter pressures. By contrast, a particular syndrome (immediate overlapping of cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection) (minute gastric lesion or largely attenuated hemorrhagic ulceration, tongue affected, minute esophageal and duodenal lesions, but with intact mucosa; sphincters pressures lowered) appeared after intra(per)-oral administration (1 min-24 h) as well as after combined administrations (intra(per)-oral + intragastric). BPC 157 apparently cured all alcohol-lesions, amplified the spontaneously initiated strong mucosal beneficial effect, rescued sphincter pressures; NO-agents (L-arginine (slight mucosal amelioration) and L-NAME (aggravation)) showed NO-system involvement, but no comparable effects on dropped sphincters pressures. In conclusion, minute gastric lesions (with oral application of strong alcohol at the tongue and swallowed, without, or with intragastric application of strong alcohol) renew and revise Robert's stomach cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection concept. The tongue becomes a new initial target, resulting in spontaneous reversal of strong alcohol-stomach lesions. BPC 157 therapy functions also within the redirected complexity of Robert's stomach cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection concept.",

      "abstract": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are attractive hosts for the expression of heterologous proteins and can be engineered to deliver therapeutic proteins or peptides to mucosal surfaces. The gastric stable pentadecapeptide BPC-157 is able to prevent and treat gastrointestinal inflammation by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we used LAB Lactococcus lactis as a vector to deliver BPC-157 by surface display and trypsin shedding or by secretion to the growth medium. Surface display of BPC-157 was achieved by fusing it with basic membrane protein A (BmpA) or with the peptidoglycan binding domain of AcmA and Usp45 secretion signal. While the expression of BmpA-fusion proteins was higher than that of AcmA/Usp45-fusion protein, the surface display ability of BPC-157 was approximately 14-fold higher with AcmA/Usp45-fusion protein. Release of BPC-157 from the bacterial surface or from isolated fusion proteins by trypsinization was demonstrated with anti-BPC-157 antibodies or by mass spectrometry. The concentration of BPC-157 delivered by surface display via AcmA/Usp45-fusion was 30 ng/ml. This increased to 117 ng/ml by Usp45 signal-mediated secretion, making the latter the most effective lactococcal delivery approach for BPC-157. Secreted BPC-157 significantly decreased ROS production in 149BR fibroblast cell model, suggesting its potential benefit in the treatment of intestinal inflammations. Additionally, a comparison of different modes of small peptide delivery by L. lactis, performed in the present study, will facilitate the future use of L. lactis as peptide delivery vehicle.",

      "abstract": "Years ago, we revealed a novel cytoprotective mediator, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, particular anti-ulcer peptide that heals different organs lesions when given as a therapy, native in human gastric juice while maintaining GI-tract mucosal integrity, already tested in trials (ulcerative colitis and now multiple sclerosis). The stomach cytoprotection is the most fundamental concept, stomach cell protection and endothelium protection are largely elaborated, but so far cell, protection and endothelium protection outside of the stomach were not implemented in the therapy. However, having managed these two points, stomach cell protection and endothelium protection, either one or together, even much more than standard cytoprotective agents do, BPC 157 employed large scale of its beneficial effects seen in various organs. Providing endothelium protection, BPC 157 was shown to prevent formation and reverse established thrombosis in anastomosed abdominal aorta as well as venous thrombosis after inferior caval vein occlusion, and attenuate bleeding prolongation and thrombocytopenia after amputation, without or with anticoagulants, or venous occlusion, and finally counteract effect of L-NAME and/or L- arginine. Now, with BPC 157 application, we reveal the third most important part of the cytoprotection concept: with the stomach cell and endothelium protection to recover mucosal integrity, BPC 157 as prototype cytoprotective agent should also control blood vessel function, depending upon injury, perforated defect or vessel obstruction. After a perforated injury (i.e., stomach), BPC 157 therapy activates blood vessels \"running\" towards defect. After obstruction (i.e., inferior caval vein), BPC 157 activates vessels \"running\" towards bypassing defect, collaterals functioning. Reestablished blood flow, and largely reversed injurious course may practically implement the cytoprotection concept.",

As a novel approach in therapy, we hypothesize the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 in honeybee therapy, to control N. ceranae invasions in apiary conditions: BPC 157 treated sugar syrup (0.25 L sugar syrup supplemented with 0.1 μg/ml BPC 157), as well as the pure sugar syrup (0.25 L sugar syrup; control), was administered to honeybee colonies in feeders situated under the roof of the hives, during 21 consecutive days, at the end of beekeeping season. The strength of honeybee colonies was increased 20 and 30 days after initial feeding with BPC 157 supplement (Day 1, 36.100 ± 698; Day 20, 64.860 ± 468; Day 30, 53.214 ± 312 estimated number of honeybees), in field conditions. The similar successful outcome occurs with the N. ceranae spore loads counted in the homogenates of sampled adult honeybees (Day 1, 6.286 ± 2.336; Day 20, 3.753 ± 1.835; Day 30, 2.005 ± 1.534 million spores/bee). Accordingly, with the noted increased strength of the colonies fed with sugar syrup supplemented with BPC 157, the number of N. ceranae spores per honeybee gradually decreased as well. Besides, honeybees infected with N. ceranae fed with sugar syrup exhibited severe damage of midgut wall layers and epithelial cells. By contrast, in honeybees infected with N. ceranae fed with sugar syrup supplemented with BPC 157, all damages were markedly attenuated, damages of the outer muscular coat, in particular. In conclusion, the results of the first field trial on diseased honeybee colonies with BPC 157 indicate significant therapeutic effects with the used oral therapy with BPC 157 supplementation.",

We revealed that BPC 157's therapy collectively attenuated or counteracted all these events and the full syndrome. METHODS: We applied BPC 157 (10 μg, 10 ng/kg) as an early regimen or as a delayed therapy. Assessment includes gross assessment by microcamera; microscopy, venography, bleeding, blood pressure, ECG, thermography, MDA and NO-level in plasma and ICV, and gene expression. RESULTS: Direct vein injury, thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, prolonged bleeding were all counteracted. Also, rapid presentation of collaterals and redistribution of otherwise trapped blood volume (bypassing through the left ovarian vein (LOV) and other veins), with venous hypertension, arterial hypotension and tachycardia counteraction were shown. BPC 157-rats presented raised plasma NO-values, but normal MDA-values; in ICV tissue reverted low NO-values and counteracted increased MDA-levels. Altered expression of EGR, NOS, SRF, VEGFR and KRAS in ICV, ROV and LOV revealed increased or decreased levels, while some genes continuously remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: As a new insight, BPC 157 application largely attenuated or even completely eliminated all consequences of ICV ligation in rats.",

IC + OB-rats [IC-rats had additional colon obstruction (OB)] for 3 d (IC + OB-rats), then received BPC 157 bath. RESULTS: Commonly, in colon segment (25 mm, 2 ligations on left colic artery and vein, 3 arcade vessels within ligated segment), in IC-, IC + RL-, IC + OB-rats, BPC 157 (10 μg/kg) bath (1 mL/rat) increased vessel presentation, inside/outside arcade interconnections quickly reappeared, mucosal folds were preserved and the pale areas were small and markedly reduced. BPC 157 counteracted worsening effects induced by L-NAME (5 mg) and L-arginine (100 mg). MDA- and NO-levels were normal in BPC 157 treated IC-rats and IC + RL-rats. In addition, on day 10, BPC 157-treated IC + OB-rats presented almost completely spared mucosa with very small pale areas and no gross mucosal defects; the treated colon segment was of normal diameter, and only small adhesions were present. CONCLUSION: BPC 157 is a fundamental treatment that quickly restores blood supply to the ischemically injured area and rapidly activates collaterals. This effect involves the NO system.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To counteract/reveal celecoxib-induced toxicity and NO system involvement. METHODS: Celecoxib (1 g/kg b.w. ip) was combined with therapy with stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (known to inhibit these lesions, 10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg, or 1 ng/kg ip) and L-arginine (100 mg/kg ip), as well as NOS blockade [N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)] (5 mg/kg ip) given alone and/or combined immediately after celecoxib. Gastrointestinal, liver, and brain lesions and liver enzyme serum values in rats were assessed at 24 h and 48 h thereafter. RESULTS: This high-dose celecoxib administration, as a result of NO system dysfunction, led to gastric, liver, and brain lesions and increased liver enzyme serum values. The L-NAME-induced aggravation of the lesions was notable for gastric lesions, while in liver and brain lesions the beneficial effect of L-arginine was blunted. L-arginine counteracted gastric, liver and brain lesions. These findings support the NO system mechanism(s), both NO system agonization (L-arginine) and NO system antagonization (L-NAME), that on the whole are behind all of these COX phenomena. An even more complete antagonization was identified with BPC 157 (at both 24 h and 48 h). A beneficial effect was evident on all the increasingly negative effects of celecoxib and L-NAME application and in all the BPC 157 groups (L-arginine + BPC 157; L-NAME + BPC 157; L-NAME + L-arginine + BPC 157). Thus, these findings demonstrated that BPC 157 may equally counteract both COX-2 inhibition (counteracting the noxious effects of celecoxib on all lesions) and additional NOS blockade (equally counteracting the noxious effects of celecoxib + L-NAME). CONCLUSION: BPC 157 and L-arginine alleviate gastrointestinal, liver and brain lesions, redressing NSAIDs' post-surgery application and NO system involvement.",

      "abstract": "We revealed a new point with cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 7 days): we counteracted both rat stomach and duodenal ulcers and increased NO- and MDA-levels in these tissues. As a NO-system effect, BPC 157 therapy (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg, intraperitoneally once a day or in drinking water, till the sacrifice) attenuated the increased NO- and MDA-levels and nullified, in rats, severe cyclophosphamide-ulcers and even stronger stomach and duodenal lesions after cyclophosphamide + L-NAME (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally once a day). L-arginine (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally once a day not effective alone) led L-NAME-values only to the control values (cyclophosphamide + L-NAME + L-arginine-rats). Briefly, rats were sacrificed at 24 h after last administration on days 1, 2, 3, or 7, and assessment included sum of longest lesions diameters (mm) in the stomach and duodenum, oxidative stress by quantifying thiobarbituric acid reactivity as malondialdehyde equivalents (MDA), NO in stomach and duodenal tissue samples using the Griess reaction. All these parameters were highly exaggerated in rats who underwent cyclophosphamide treatment. We identified high MDA-tissue values, high NO-tissue values, ulcerogenic and beneficial potential in cyclophosphamide-L-NAME-L-arginine-BPC 157 relationships. This suggests that in cyclophosphamide damaged rats, NO excessive release generated by the inducible isozyme, damages the vascular wall and other tissue cells, especially in combination with reactive oxygen intermediates, while failing endothelial production and resulting in further aggravation by L-NAME which was inhibited by L-arginine. Finally, BPC 157, due to its special relations with NO-system, may both lessen increased MDA- and NO-tissues values and counteract effects of both cyclophosphamide and L-NAME on stomach and duodenal lesions.",

      "abstract": "Selye's syndrome produced by diverse nocuous agents and \"response to damage as such\" means Selye's stress triad in stress coping response to reestablish homeostasis. Logically, from the gastrointestinal tract viewpoint, such organoprotective/healing response implies the angiogenic growth factors that commonly signify the healing. Thereby, the gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157-organoprotection (huge range of beneficial effects) signifies the Selye's stress concept/stress coping response implemented in and from gastrointestinal tract, and BPC 157 as an integrative mediator that integrates the adaptive bodily response to stress. In clinical trials without side effects, LD1 not achieved, BPC 157 healing in gastrointestinal tract, and particularly the healing of the extragastrointestinal tissues (i.e., skin/tendon/ligament/muscle/bone; nerve; cornea/ brain) were referred throughout its integrative capabilities (i.e., ulcerative colitis/multiple sclerosis model equally counteracted), native in gastrointestinal tract, stability in human gastric juice (and thereby, strong efficacy and applicability), its relevance for dopamine-system function (and thereby, counteracting effects of dopamine-system dysfunction and overfunction, centrally and peripherally (mucosa maintenance); interaction with serotonin- and GABA-system)), afforded cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection/organoprotection (and thereby, beneficial effects on gastric and whole intestinal tract lesions and adaptation, wounds and fistulas healing, blood vessels, somatosensory neurons, NSAIDs-side effects (including also pancreas, liver, brain lesions, and blood disturbances, prolonged bleeding, thrombocytopenia, thrombosis)). Further, we combine such gut-brain axis and the NO-system where BPC 157 counteracts complications of either L-NAME application (i.e., various lesions aggravation, hypertension) or Larginine application (i.e., hypotension, prolonged bleeding, thrombocytopenia). Also, BPC 157 particularly affects genes functions (i.e., Fos, c-Jun, Egr-1), all together suggestive for an indicative generalization. Thus, we could suggest gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 and BPC 157 induced-organoprotection as integrative mediator that integrates the adaptive bodily response to stress, and thereby practically applied in further therapy and in effective realization of Selye's stress response.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, administered before a high-dose magnesium injection in rats, might be a useful peptide therapy against magnesium toxicity and the magnesium-induced effect on cell depolarization. Moreover, this might be an NO-system-related effect. Previously, BPC 157 counteracts paralysis, arrhythmias and hyperkalaemia, extreme muscle weakness; parasympathetic and neuromuscular blockade; injured muscle healing and interacts with the NOS-blocker and NOS-substrate effects. MAIN METHODS: Assessment included magnesium sulfate (560 mg/kg intraperitoneally)-induced muscle weakness, muscle and brain lesions, hypermagnesemia, hyperkalaemia, increased serum enzyme values assessed in rats during and at the end of a 30-min period and medication (given intraperitoneally/kg at 15 min before magnesium) [BPC 157 (10 µg, 10 ng), L-NAME (5 mg), L-arginine (100 mg), alone and/or together]. In HEK293 cells, the increasing magnesium concentration from 1 to 5 mM could depolarize the cells at 1.75 ± 0.44 mV. KEY FINDINGS: L-NAME + magnesium-rats and L-arginine + magnesium-rats exhibited worsened severe muscle weakness and lesions, brain lesions, hypermagnesemia and serum enzymes values, with emerging hyperkalaemia. However, L-NAME + L-arginine + magnesium-rats exhibited all control values and normokalaemia. BPC 157 abrogated hypermagnesemia and counteracted all of the magnesium-induced disturbances (including those aggravated by L-NAME or L-arginine). Thus, cell depolarization due to increasing magnesium concentration was inhibited in the presence of BPC 157 (1 µM) in vitro. SIGNIFICANCE: BPC 157 likely counteracts the initial event leading to hypermagnesemia and the life-threatening actions after a magnesium overdose. In contrast, a worsened clinical course, higher hypermagnesemia, and emerging hyperkalaemia might cause both L-NAME and L-arginine to affect the same events adversely. These events were also opposed by BPC 157.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To cure typically life-threatening esophagogastric anastomosis in rats, lacking anastomosis healing and sphincter function rescue, in particular. METHODS: Because we assume esophagogastric fistulas represent a particular NO-system disability, we attempt to identify the benefits of anti-ulcer stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, which was in trials for ulcerative colitis and currently for multiple sclerosis, in rats with esophagocutaneous fistulas. Previously, BPC 157 therapies have promoted the healing of intestinal anastomosis and fistulas, and esophagitis and gastric lesions, along with rescued sphincter function. Additionally, BPC 157 particularly interacts with the NO-system. In the 4 d after esophagogastric anastomosis creation, rats received medication (/kg intraperitoneally once daily: BPC 157 (10 μg, 10 ng), L-NAME (5 mg), or L-arginine (100 mg) alone and/or combined or BPC 157 (10 μg, 10 ng) in drinking water). For rats underwent esophagogastric anastomosis, daily assessment included progressive stomach damage (sum of the longest diameters, mm), esophagitis (scored 0-5), weak anastomosis (mL H2O before leak), low pressure in esophagus at anastomosis and in the pyloric sphincter (cm H2O), progressive weight loss (g) and mortality. Immediate effect assessed blood vessels disappearance (scored 0-5) at the stomach surface immediately after anastomosis creation. RESULTS: BPC 157 (all regimens) fully counteracted the perilous disease course from the very beginning (i.e., with the BPC 157 bath, blood vessels remained present at the gastric surface after anastomosis creation) and eliminated mortality. Additionally, BPC 157 treatment in combination with L-NAME nullified any effect of L-NAME that otherwise intensified the regular course. Consistently, with worsening (with L-NAME administration) and amelioration (with L-arginine), either L-arginine amelioration prevails (attenuated esophageal and gastric lesions) or they counteract each other (L-NAME + L-arginine); with the addition of BPC 157 (L-NAME + L-arginine + BPC 157), there was a marked beneficial effect. BPC 157 treatment for esophagogastric anastomosis, along with NOS-blocker L-NAME and/or NOS substrate L-arginine, demonstrated an innate NO-system disability (as observed with L-arginine effectiveness). BPC 157 distinctively affected corresponding events: worsening (obtained with L-NAME administration that was counteracted); or amelioration (L-arginine + BPC 157-rats correspond to BPC 157-rats). CONCLUSION: Innate NO-system disability for esophagogastric anastomoses, including L-NAME-worsening, suggests that these effects could be corrected by L-arginine and almost completely eliminated by BPC 157 therapy.",

      "abstract": "Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was previously used to ameliorate wound healing following major surgery and counteract diclofenac toxicity. To resolve the increasing early risks following major massive small bowel resectioning surgery, diclofenac combined with nitric oxide (NO) system blockade was used, suggesting therapy with BPC 157 and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS substrate) L-arginine, is efficacious. Immediately after anastomosis creation, short-bowel rats were untreated or administered intraperitoneal diclofenac (12 mg/kg), BPC 157 (10 μg/kg or 10 ng/kg), L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 5 mg/kg), L-arginine (100 mg/kg) alone or combined, and assessed 24 h later. Short-bowel rats exhibited poor anastomosis healing, failed intestine adaptation, and gastrointestinal, liver, and brain lesions, which worsened with diclofenac. This was gradually ameliorated by immediate therapy with BPC 157 and L-arginine. Contrastingly, NOS-blocker L-NAME induced further aggravation and lesions gradually worsened. Specifically, rats with surgery alone exhibited mild stomach/duodenum lesions, considerable liver lesions, and severe cerebral/hippocampal lesions while those also administered diclofenac showed widespread severe lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, cerebellar nuclear/Purkinje cells, and cerebrum/hippocampus. Rats subjected to surgery, diclofenac, and L-NAME exhibited the mentioned lesions, worsening anastomosis, and macro/microscopical necrosis. Thus, rats subjected to surgery alone showed evidence of deterioration. Furtheremore, rats subjected to surgery and administered diclofenac showed worse symptoms, than the rats subjected to surgery alone did. Rats subjected to surgery combined with diclofenac and L-NAME showed the worst deterioration. Rats subjected to surgery exhibited habitual adaptation of the remaining small intestine, which was markedly reversed in rats subjected to surgery and diclofenac, and those with surgery, diclofenac, and L-NAME. BPC 157 completely ameliorated symptoms in massive intestinal resection-, massive intestinal resection plus diclofenac-, and massive intestinal resection plus diclofenac plus L-NAME-treated short bowel rats that presented with cyclooxygenase (COX)-NO-system inhibition. L-arginine ameliorated only L-NAME-induced aggravation of symptoms in rats subjected to massive intestinal resection and administered diclofenac plus L-NAME.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain-gut interaction involves, among others, peptidergic growth factors which are native in GI tract and have strong antiulcer potency and thus could from periphery beneficially affect CNS-disorders. We focused on the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, an antiulcer peptidergic agent, safe in inflammatory bowel disease trials and now in multiple sclerosis trial, native and stable in human gastric juice. METHODS: Review of our research on BPC 157 in terms of brain-gut axis. RESULTS: BPC 157 may serve as a novel mediator of Robert's cytoprotection, involved in maintaining of GI mucosa integrity, with no toxic effect. BPC 157 was successful in the therapy of GI tract, periodontitis, liver and pancreas lesions, and in the healing of various tissues and wounds. Stimulated Egr-1 gene, NAB2, FAK-paxillin and JAK-2 pathways are hitherto implicated. Initially corresponding beneficial central influence was seen when BPC 157 was given peripherally and a serotonin release in particular brain areas, mostly nigrostriatal, was changed. BPC 157 modulates serotonergic and dopaminergic systems, beneficially affects various behavioral disturbances that otherwise appeared due to specifically (over)stimulated/damaged neurotransmitters systems. Besides, BPC 157 has neuroprotective effects: protects somatosensory neurons; peripheral nerve regeneration appearent after transection; after traumatic brain injury counteracts the otherwise progressing course, in rat spinal cord compression with tail paralysis, axonal and neuronal necrosis, demyelination, cyst formation and rescues tail function in both short-terms and long-terms; after NSAIDs or insulin overdose or cuprizone encephalopathies were attenuated along with GI, liver and vascular injuries. CONCLUSION: BPC 157, a gastric peptide, may serve as remedy in various CNS-disorders.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Rectovaginal fistula is a devastating condition providing more than 99% of patients for surgical treatment. We hypothesized that rectovaginal fistula may be healed by therapy with stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, in consistence with its initial clinical application and effect on external fistulas. MAIN METHODS: BPC 157 (10μg/kg or 10ng/kg) was given perorally, in drinking water (0.16μg/ml or 0.16ng/ml, 12ml/rat/day) till sacrifice, or alternatively, intraperitoneally, first application at 30min after surgery, last at 24h before sacrifice. Controls simultaneously received an equivolume of saline (5.0ml/kg ip) or water only (12ml/rat/day). The assessment (i.e., rectal and vaginal defect, fistula leakage, defecation through the fistula, adhesions and intestinal obstruction as healing processes) was at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21. KEY FINDINGS: Regularly, rectovaginal fistulas exhibited poor healing, with both of the defects persisting, continuous fistula leakage, defecation through the fistula, advanced adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction. By contrast, BPC 157 given perorally or intraperitoneally, in μg- and ng-regimens rapidly improved the whole presentation, with both rectal and vaginal defects simultaneously ameliorated and eventually healed. The maximal instilled volume was continuously raised till the values of healthy rats were achieved, there were no signs of defecation through the fistula. A counteraction of advanced adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction was achieved. Microscopic improvement was along with macroscopic findings. SIGNIFICANCE: BPC 157 effects appear to be suited to induce a full healing of rectovaginal fistulas in rats.",

      "abstract": "While very rarely reported, duodenocutanenous fistula research might alter the duodenal ulcer disease background and therapy. Our research focused on rat duodenocutaneous fistulas, therapy, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, an anti-ulcer peptide that healed other fistulas, nitric oxide synthase-substrate L-arginine, and nitric oxide synthase-inhibitor L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The hypothesis was, duodenal ulcer-healing, like the skin ulcer, using the successful BPC 157, with nitric oxide-system involvement, the \"wound healing-therapy\", to heal the duodenal ulcer, the fistula-model that recently highlighted gastric and skin ulcer healing. Pressure in the lower esophageal and pyloric sphincters was simultaneously assessed. Duodenocutaneous fistula-rats received BPC 157 (10 μg/kg or 10 ng/kg, intraperitoneally or perorally (in drinking water)), L-NAME (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally), L-arginine (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally) alone and/or together, throughout 21 days. Duodenocutaneous fistula-rats maintained persistent defects, continuous fistula leakage, sphincter failure, mortality rate at 40% until the 4(th) day, all fully counteracted in all BPC 157-rats. The BPC 157-rats experienced rapidly improved complete presentation (maximal volume instilled already at 7(th) day). L-NAME further aggravated the duodenocutaneous fistula-course (mortality at 70% until the 4(th) day); L-arginine was beneficial (no mortality; however, maximal volume instilled not before 21(st) day). L-NAME-worsening was counteracted to the control level with the L-arginine effect, and vice versa, while BPC 157 annulled the L-NAME effects (L-NAME + L-arginine; L-NAME + BPC 157; L-NAME + L-arginine + BPC 157 brought below the level of the control). It is likely that duodenocutaneous fistulas, duodenal/skin defect simultaneous healing, reinstated sphincter function, are a new nitric oxide-system related phenomenon. In conclusion, resolving the duodenocutanenous fistulashealing, nitric oxide-system involvement, should illustrate further wound healing therapy to heal duodenal ulcers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: BPC 157 is a stable gastric pentadecapeptide recently implicated with a role in hemostasis. While NO is largely implicated in hemostatic mechanisms, in tail-amputation-models under heparin- and warfarin-administration, both the NO-synthase (NOS)-blocker, L-NAME (prothrombotic) and the NOS-substrate L-arginine (antithrombotic), were little investigated. Objective. To investigate the effect of L-NAME and L-arginine on hemostatic parameters, and to reveal the effects of BPC 157 on the L-NAME- and L-arginine-induced hemostatic actions under different pathological condition: tail amputation without or with anticoagulants, heparin or warfarin. METHODS: Tail amputation, and/or i.v.-heparin (10 mg/kg), i.g.-warfarin (1.5 mg/kg/day for 3 days) were used in rats. Treatment includes BPC 157, L-NAME, L-arginine, per se and their combination. RESULTS: After (tail) amputation, with or without i.v.-heparin or i.g.-warfarin, BPC 157 (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg, i.p., i.v. (heparin), 10 μg/kg i.g. (warfarin)) always reduced bleeding time and/or haemorrhage and counteracted thrombocytopenia. As for L-NAME and/or L-arginine, we noted: L-arginine (100 mg/kg i.p.)-rats: more bleeding, less/no thrombocytopenia; L-NAME (5 mg/kg i.p.)-rats: less bleeding (amputation only), but present thrombocytopenia; L-NAME+L-arginine-rats also exhibited thrombocytopenia: L-NAME counteracted L-arginine-increased bleeding, L-arginine did not counteract L-NAME-thrombocytopenia. All animals receiving BPC 157 in addition (BPC 157 μg+L-NAME; BPC 157 μg+L-arginine, BPC 157 μg+L-NAME+L-arginine), exhibited decreased haemorrhage and markedly counteracted thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: L-NAME (thrombocytopenia), L-arginine (increased haemorrhage) counteraction and BPC 157 (decreased haemorrhage, counteracted thrombocytopenia) with rescue against two different anticoagulants, implicate a BPC 157 modulatory and balancing role with rescued NO-hemostatic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was suggested to link inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis, and thereby, shown to equally counteract the models of both of those diseases. For colitis, cysteamine (400 mg/kg intrarectally (1 ml/rat)) and colon-colon anastomosis (sacrifice at day 3, 5, 7, and 14) were used. BPC 157 (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg) was applied either intraperitoneally once time daily (first application immediately after surgery, last at 24 hours before sacrifice) or per-orally in drinking water (0.16 μg/ml/12 ml/day till the sacrifice) while controls simultaneously received an equivolume of saline (5 ml/kg) intraperitoneally or drinking water only (12 ml/day). A multiple sclerosis suited toxic rat model, cuprizone (compared with standard, a several times higher regimen, 2.5% of diet regimen + 1 g/kg intragastrically/day) was combined with BPC 157 (in drinking water 0.16 μg or 0.16 ng/ml/12 ml/day/rat + 10 μg or 10 ng/kg intragastrically/day) till the sacrifice at day 4. In general, the controls could not heal cysteamine colitis and colon-colon anastomosis. BPC 157 induced an efficient healing of both at the same time. Likewise, cuprizone-controls clearly exhibited an exaggerated and accelerated damaging process; nerve damage appeared in various brain areas, with most prominent damage in corpus callosum, laterodorsal thalamus, nucleus reunions, anterior horn motor neurons. BPC 157-cuprizone rats had consistently less nerve damage in all damaged areas, especially in those areas that otherwise were most affected. Consistently, BPC 157 counteracted cerebellar ataxia and impaired forelimb function. Thereby, this experimental evidence advocates BPC 157 in both inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since an originally anti-ulcer stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (PL 14736) was shown to promote healing of injured striated muscle and smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, we explored its therapeutic potentials for leak point pressure (LPP) recovery in rat stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after transabdominal urethrolysis (TU) and prolonged vaginal dilatation (VD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: During a 7-day period, TU-rats and VD-rats (or healthy rats) received BPC 157, either (i) intraperitoneally, 10 µg/kg or 10 ng/kg, once daily (first administration 30 min after surgery, last 24 h before LPP-testing and sacrifice), or (ii) per-orally, 10 µg/kg in drinking water (0.16 µg/mL, 12 mL/rat/day). Vesicourethral segments were harvested for immunohistochemical evaluation. RESULTS: All BPC 157 regimens counteracted decrease of LPP values in TU-rats and VD-rats. Additionally, BPC 157-TU rats (µg-intraperitoneally or per-orally) and BPC 157-VD rats (µg intraperitoneally) reached LPP values originally noted in healthy rats. Conversely, in healthy rats, BPC 157 did not alter LPP. Immunohistochemical studies revealed higher desmin (delineates striated organization of skeletal muscle), smooth muscle actin, and CD34 (angiogenic marker) positivity within the urethral wall in BPC 157-treated rats vs. controls, as well as overall preserved muscle/connective tissue ratio assessed with Mallory's trichrome staining. CONCLUSIONS: Pentadecapeptide BPC 157, applied parenterally or per-orally, appears to ameliorate the SUI in rat models, improving the otherwise detrimental course of healing after VD and TU, which may be analogous to human injury. These beneficial effects may possibly be selectively used in future strategies for treatment of SUI.",

(i) We demonstrated potential (/kg) of: BPC 157 (10ng, 10μg ip, complete counteraction), l-arginine (100mg ip, attenuation) vs. L-NAME (5mg ip, deadly aggravation), given alone and/or combined, before or after intraperitoneal KCl-solution application (9mEq/kg). Therapy was confronted with promptly unrelenting hyperkalemia (>12mmol/L), arrhythmias (and muscular weakness, hypertension, low pressure in lower esophageal and pyloric sphincter) with an ultimate and a regularly inevitable lethal outcome within 30min. Previously, we established BPC 157-NO-system interaction; now, a huge life-saving potential. Given 30min before KCl, all BPC 157 regimens regained sinus rhythm, had less prolongation of QRS, and had no asystolic pause. BPC 157 therapy, given 10min after KCl-application, starts the rescue within 5-10min, completely restoring normal sinus rhythm at 1h. Likewise, other hyperkalemia-disturbances (muscular weakness, hypertension, low sphincteric pressure) were also counteracted. Accordingly with NO-system relation, deadly aggravation by L-NAME: l-arginine brings the values to the control levels while BPC 157 always completely nullified lesions, markedly below those of controls. Combined with l-arginine, BPC 157 exhibited no additive effect. (ii) Intragastric KCl-solution application (27mEq/kg) - (hyperkalemia 7mmol/L): severe stomach mucosal lesions, sphincter failure and peaked T waves were fully counteracted by intragastric BPC 157 (10ng, 10μg) application, given 30min before or 10min after KCl. (iii). In HEK293 cells, hyperkalemic conditions (18.6mM potassium concentrations), BPC 157 directly affects potassium conductance, counteracting the effect on membrane potential and depolarizations caused by hyperkalemic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Esophagocutaneous fistulas are a failure of the NO-system, due to NO-synthase blockage by the NOS-blocker L-NAME consequently counteracted by l-arginine and gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (l-arginine <BPC 157), precipitating a therapeutic benefit. Previously, there was an established BPC 157-NO-system interaction. BPC 157 GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, MW 1419 (LD1 not achieved), is a safe and stable anti-ulcer peptide, successful in inflammatory bowel disease trials, counteracting esophagitis, sphincter failure, gastrointestinal and skin ulcers, gastrocutaneous or colocutaneous fistulas. We treated rats with established cervical esophagocutaneous fistulas throughout four days (both open skin and esophageal defects, with significant leakage) with BPC 157 (parenterally and perorally) and L-NAME (blocking NO genesis) and l-arginine (NO-substrate) alone or in combination. RT-PCR investigated eNOS, iNOS, COX-2 mRNA levels in the fistulas. We evidenced a closely inter-related process of unhealed skin, esophageal defects, unhealed fistulas (up regulated eNOS, iNOS and COX2 mRNA levels), usually lethal, particularly NO-system related and therapy dependent. Generally, the course of fistula healing was accelerated either to a greater extent (with BPC 157 (in particular, less eNOS gene expression) completely counteracting L-NAME effects, in L-NAME+BPC 157 and L-NAME+l-arginine+BPC 157 groups), or to a lesser extent (with l-arginine). Conversely, the process was aggravated, rapidly and prominently (with L-NAME). In particular, BPC 157 was effective either given per-orally/intraperitoneally, in μg- and ng-regimens. Shortly, defects started to heal, with less fistula leakage and no mortality at day 4. Failure of pyloric and lower esophageal sphincter pressure was restored, with practically no esophagitis.",

BPC 157, in addition to an antiulcer effect efficient in therapy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (PL 14736) so far only tested in clinical phase II, has a very safe profile, and exhibited a particular wound healing effect. It also has shown to interact with the NO-system, providing endothelium protection and angiogenic effect, even in severely impaired conditions (i.e., it stimulated expression of early growth response 1 gene responsible for cytokine and growth factor generation and early extracellular matrix (collagen) formation (but also its repressor nerve growth factor 1-A binding protein-2)), important to counteract severe complications of advanced and poorly controlled IBD. Hopefully, the lessons from animal studies, particularly advanced intestinal anastomosis healing, reversed short bowel syndrome and fistula healing indicate BPC 157's high significance in further IBD therapy. Also, this supportive evidence (i.e., no toxic effect, limit test negative, LD1 not achieved, no side effect in trials) may counteract the problems commonly exercised in the use of peptidergic agents, particularly those used on a long-term basis.",

      "abstract": "Possibly, acute esophagitis and pancreatitis cause each other, and we focused on sphincteric failure as the common causative key able to induce either esophagitis and acute pancreatitis or both of them, and thereby investigate the presence of a common therapy nominator. This may be an anti-ulcer pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (tested for inflammatory bowel disease, wound treatment) affecting esophagitis, lower esophageal and pyloric sphincters failure and acute pancreatitis (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg intraperitoneally or in drinking water). The esophagitis-sphincter failure procedure (i.e., insertion of the tubes into the sphincters, lower esophageal and pyloric) and acute pancreatitis procedure (i.e., bile duct ligation) were combined in rats. Esophageal manometry was done in acute pancreatitis patients. In rats acute pancreatitis procedure produced also esophagitis and both sphincter failure, decreased pressure 24 h post-surgery. Furthermore, bile duct ligation alone immediately declines the pressure in both sphincters. Vice versa, the esophagitis-sphincter failure procedure alone produced acute pancreatitis. What's more, these lesions (esophagitis, sphincter failure, acute pancreatitis when combined) aggravate each other (tubes into sphincters and ligated bile duct). Counteraction occurred by BPC 157 therapies. In acute pancreatitis patients lower pressure at rest was in both esophageal sphincters in acute pancreatitis patients. We conclude that BPC 157 could cure esophagitis/sphincter/acute pancreatitis healing failure.",

We focused on BPC 157 as a therapy in peridontitis, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, intestine, liver and pancreas lesions. Particularly, it has a prominent effect on alcohol-lesions (i.e., acute, chronic) and NSAIDs-lesions (interestingly, BPC 157 both prevents and reverses adjuvant arthritis). In rat esophagitis and failed function of both lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and pyloric sphincters (PS), BPC 157 increased pressure in both sphincters till normal and reduced esophagitis. However, in healthy rats, it may decrease (PS) or increase (LES) the pressure in sphincters. It has strong angiogenic potential, it acts protectively on endothelium, prevents and reverses thrombus formation after abdominal aorta anastomosis, affects many central disturbances (i.e., dopamine and 5-HT system), the NO-system (either L-arginine and L-NAME effects), endothelin, acts as a free radical scavenger (counteracting CCl4-, paracetamol-, diclofenac-injuries) and exhibits neuroprotective properties. BPC 157 successfully heals the intestinal anastomosis, gastrocutaneous, duodenocutaneous and colocutaneous fistulas in rats, as well as interacting with the NO-system. Interestingly, the fistula closure was achieved even when the BPC 157 therapy was postponed for one month. In short-bowel syndrome escalating throughout 4 weeks, the constant weight gain above preoperative values started immediately with peroral and parental BPC 157 therapy and the villus height, crypth depth and muscle thickness (inner (circular) muscular layer) additionally increased. Thus, BPC 157 may improve gastrointestinal tract therapy.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: We attempted to fully antagonize the extensive toxicity caused by NSAIDs (using diclofenac as a prototype). MAIN METHODS: Herein, we used the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, MW 1419), an anti-ulcer peptide shown to be efficient in inflammatory bowel disease clinical trials (PL 14736) and various wound treatments with no toxicity reported. This peptide was given to antagonize combined gastrointestinal, liver, and brain toxicity induced by diclofenac (12.5mg/kg intraperitoneally, once daily for 3 days) in rats. KEY FINDINGS: Already considered a drug that can reverse the toxic side effects of NSAIDs, BPC 157 (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg) was strongly effective throughout the entire experiment when given (i) intraperitoneally immediately after diclofenac or (ii) per-orally in drinking water (0.16 μg/mL, 0.16 ng/mL). Without BPC 157 treatment, at 3h following the last diclofenac challenge, we encountered a complex deleterious circuit of diclofenac toxicity characterized by severe gastric, intestinal and liver lesions, increased bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) serum values, increased liver weight, prolonged sedation/unconsciousness (after any diclofenac challenge) and finally hepatic encephalopathy (brain edema particularly located in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, more in white than in gray matter, damaged red neurons, particularly in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar nuclei, Purkinje cells and less commonly in the hippocampal neurons). SIGNIFICANCE: The very extensive antagonization of diclofenac toxicity achieved with BPC 157 (μg-/ng-regimen, intraperitoneally, per-orally) may encourage its further use as a therapy to counteract diclofenac- and other NSAID-induced toxicity.",

We investigate a particular aspect of the sudden onset of encephalopathy with extreme paracetamol overdose (5 g/kg intraperitoneally) so far not reported: rapidly induced progressive hepatic encephalopathy with generalized convulsions in rats. BPC 157 therapy (10 microg, 10 ng, 10 pg/kg, intraperitoneally or intragastrically) was effective (microg-ng range) against paracetamol toxicity, given in early (BPC 157 immediately after paracetamol, prophylactically) or advanced stage (BPC 157 at 3 hours after paracetamol, therapeutically). At 25 min post-paracetamol increased ALT, AST and ammonium serum values precede liver lesion while in several brain areas, significant damage became apparent, accompanied by generalized convulsions. Through the next 5 hour seizure period and thereafter, the brain damage, liver damage enzyme values and hyperammonemia increased, particularly throughout the 3-24 h post-paracetamol period. BPC 157 demonstrated clinical (no convulsions (prophylactic application) or convulsions rapidly disappeared (therapeutic effect within 25 min)), microscopical (markedly less liver and brain lesions) and biochemical (enzyme and ammonium serum levels decreased) counteraction. Both, the prophylactic and therapeutic benefits (intraperitoneally and intragastrically) clearly imply BPC 157 (microg-ng range) as a highly effective paracetamol antidote even against highly advanced damaging processes induced by an extreme paracetamol over-dose.",

Thereby, the effect of BPC 157 (10 microg/kg) was additionally studied at 24 h following aortic termino-terminal anastomosis.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of BPC 157 on inflammation and bone resorption in experimental periodontitis in rats. First the acute effect of BPC was tested on gingival blood flow by laser doppler flowmetry. Then periodontitis was produced by a silk ligature placed around the lower left first molar. Rats were treated with BPC 157 (once daily for 12 days) or vehicle. At day 13, the gingivomucosal tissues encircling the molars were removed on both sides. Inflammation was assessed by Evans blue plasma extravasation technique and by histology. Alveolar bone loss was analyzed by microCT. BPC 157 had no effect on gingivomucosal blood flow. Twelve day ligature caused a significantly increased Evans blue extravasation in the gingivomucosal tissue, histological signs of inflammation, and alveolar bone destruction. BPC 157 treatment significantly reduced both plasma extravasation, histological alterations and alveolar bone resorption. In conclusion, systemic application of BPC 157 does not alter blood circulation in healthy gingiva. Chronic application of the peptide has potent antiinflammatory effects on periodontal tissues in ligature induced periodontitis in rats. Taken together, this proof of concept study suggests that BPC 157 may represent a new peptide candidate in the treatment of periodontal disease.",

      "abstract": "We focused on over-dose insulin (250 IU/kg i.p.) induced gastric ulcers and then on other disturbances that were concomitantly induced in rats, seizures (eventually fatal), severely damaged neurons in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, hepatomegaly, fatty liver, increased AST, ALT and amylase serum values, breakdown of liver glycogen with profound hypoglycemia and calcification development. Calcium deposits were present in the blood vessel walls, hepatocytes surrounding blood vessels and sometimes even in parenchyma of the liver mainly as linear and only occasionally as granular accumulation. As an antidote after insulin, we applied the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (10 microg/kg) given (i) intraperitoneally or (ii) intragastrically immediately after insulin. Controls received simultaneously an equivolume of saline (5 ml/kg). Those rats that survived till the 180 minutes after over-dose application were further assessed. Interestingly, pentadecapeptide BPC 157, as an antiulcer peptide, may besides stomach ulcer consistently counteract all insulin disturbances and fatal outcome. BPC 157 rats showed no fatal outcome, they were mostly without hypoglycemic seizures with apparently higher blood glucose levels (glycogen was still present in hepatocytes), less liver pathology (i.e., normal liver weight, less fatty liver), decreased ALT, AST and amylase serum values, markedly less damaged neurons in brain and they only occasionally had small gastric lesions. BPC 157 rats exhibited mostly only dot-like calcium presentation. In conclusion, the success of BPC 157 therapy may indicate a likely role of BPC 157 in insulin controlling and BPC 157 may influence one or more causative process(es) after excessive insulin application.",

We introduced intraperitoneal, per-oral (in drinking water) and topical (thin cream layer) peptide therapy always given alone, without a carrier. Previously, as an effective peptide therapy, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, an anti-ulcer peptide effective in inflammatory bowel disease therapy (PL 14736)) particularly improved healing of transected tendon and muscle and wound healing effect including the expression of the early growth response 1 (egr-1) gene. After MCL transection BPC 157 was effective in rats when given once daily intraperitoneally (10 microg or 10 ng/kg) or locally as a thin layer (1.0 microg dissolved in distilled water/g commercial neutral cream) at the site of injury, first application 30 min after surgery and the final application 24 h before sacrifice. Likewise, BPC 157 was effective given per-orally (0.16 microg/ml in the drinking water (12 ml/day/rat)) until sacrifice. Commonly, BPC 157 microg-ng-rats exhibited consistent functional, biomechanical, macroscopic and histological healing improvements. Thus, we suggest BPC 157 improved healing of acute ligament injuries in further ligament therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of systemic and local peptide treatment effective in muscle contusion and then on counteraction of corticosteroid-induced impairment was tested. The pentadecapeptide BPC 157, given without a carrier, improved the healing of transected quadriceps muscle. It also improved muscle healing in rats with muscle crush injury when applied systemically or locally. Importantly, it counteracted corticosteroid-impairment in tendon to bone healing. Thus BPC 157 is proposed as an effective treatment that can improve muscle healing in spite of corticosteroid treatment. MATERIAL/METHODS: After the gastrocnemius muscle complex had been injured, rats received BPC 157 (intraperitoneally or locally as a cream) and/or 6alpha-methylprednisolone (intraperitoneally) only once (immediately after injury, sacrifice at 2 h) or once daily (final dose 24 hours before sacrifice and/or assessment procedure at days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14). Muscle healing was evaluated functionally, macroscopically, and histologically. RESULTS: Without therapy, crushed gastrocnemius muscle complex controls showed limited improvement. 6alpha-methylprednisolone markedly aggravated healing. In contrast, BPC 157 induced faster muscle healing and full function restoration and improved muscle healing despite systemic corticosteroid treatment when given intraperitoneally or locally and demonstrated functionally, macroscopically, and histologically at all investigated intervals. CONCLUSIONS: BPC 157 completely reversed systemic corticosteroid-impaired muscle healing.",

In therapy analogy, we challenged rats with digitalis, to show attenuation by BPC 157 and the relation between the NO-system and digitalis toxicity. (i). BPC 157 prophylactic effect. Development of cumulative intravenous digitalis toxicity, BPC 157 (50 microg, 10 microg, 10 ng/kg applied intravenously immediately before a methyldigoxin increment regimen (2.0/1.5/1.5/1.0 mg/kg at 15 min-intervals, total dose 6.0 mg/kg/45 min)) reduced the number of ventricular premature beats, prolonged the time before onset of ventricular tachycardia, reduced ventricular tachycardia and AV-block duration (microg-regimes) or reduced mainly the AV-block duration (ng-regimen). (ii). BPC 157 therapy. Advanced methyldigoxin toxicity (6.0 mg/kg i.v. bolus). BPC 157 applied at the 20th second of the grade 3 AV-block shortened AV-blocks, mitigated a further digitalis toxicity course. Ventricular tachycardias were either avoided (50 microg), or markedly reduced (10 microg, 10 ng). Fatal outcome was either avoided (50 microg), reduced (10 microg), or only delayed (10 ng) (iii) BPC 157, L-NAME, l-arginine, L-NAME+l-arginine application. L-NAME-application (5 mg/kg i.p.) aggravated methyldigoxin-arrhythmias. l-arginine (200 mg/kg i.p.) alone had no effect but blunted L-NAME-exaggeration (L-NAME+l-arginine). In this respect, BPC 157 (50 microg/kg i.p.) was prophylactically and therapeutically more effective: the antagonism of L-NAME with BPC 157 produced an effect similar to BPC 157 alone. In conclusion, digitalis-induced arrhythmias in rats could be prevented and counteracted by pentadecapeptide BPC 157, mainly through an interaction with the NO-system.",

Therefore, we studied for 4 weeks rats with escalating short bowel syndrome and progressive weight loss after small bowel resection from fourth ileal artery cranially of ileocecal valve to 5 cm beneath pylorus. BPC 157 (10 microg/kg or 10 ng/kg) was given perorally, in drinking water (12 ml/rat/day) or intraperitoneally (once daily, first application 30 min following surgery, last 24 h before sacrifice). Postoperatively, features of increasingly exhausted presentation were: weight loss appearing immediately regardless of villus height, twofold increase in crypt depth and fourfold increase in muscle thickness within the first week, jejunal and ileal overdilation, and disturbed jejunum/ileum relation. In contrast, constant weight gain above preoperative values was observed immediately with BPC 157 therapy, both perorally and parenterally, and villus height, crypt depth, and muscle thickness [inner (circular) muscular layer] also increased, at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Moreover, rats treated with pentadecapeptide BPC 157 showed not different jejunal and ileal diameters, constant jejunum-to-ileum ratio, and increased anastomosis breaking strength.

It may also be of clinical relevance as a systemic and local peptide treatment for crush injury of a major muscle, such as gastrocnemius muscle complex. BPC 157 is effective without a carrier, and it is presently undergoing trials for inflammatory bowel disease, and no toxicity has so far been reported. METHODS: In crushed rats (force delivered 0.727 Ns/cm2), BPC 157 was applied either intraperitoneally or locally, as a thin cream layer, immediately after injury (sacrifice at 2 h), and once a day for 14 days. RESULTS: BPC 157 improved muscle healing, macroscopically (less hematoma and edema, no post-injury leg contracture), microscopically, functionally, and also based on enzyme activity (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase). CONCLUSION: BPC 157, at all investigated intervals, given locally or intraperitoneally, accelerated post-injury muscle healing and also helped to restore the full function.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study focused on unhealed gastrocutaneous fistulas to resolve whether standard drugs that promote healing of gastric ulcers may simultaneously have the same effect on cutaneous wounds, and corticosteroid aggravation, and to demonstrate why peptides such as BPC 157 exhibit a greater healing effect. Therefore, with the fistulas therapy, we challenge the wound/growth factors theory of the analogous nonhealing of wounds and persistent gastric ulcers. METHODS: The healing rate of gastrocutaneous fistula in rat (2-mm-diameter stomach defect, 3-mm-diameter skin defect) validates macro/microscopically and biomechanically a direct skin wound/stomach ulcer relation, and identifies a potential therapy consisting of: (i) stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 [in drinking water (10 microg/kg) (12 ml/rat/day) or intraperitoneally (10 microg/kg, 10 ng/kg, 10 pg/kg)], (ii) atropine (10 mg/kg), ranitidine (50 mg/kg), and omeprazole (50 mg/kg), (iii) 6-alpha-methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg) [intraperitoneally, once daily, first application at 30 min following surgery; last 24 h before sacrifice (at postoperative days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 21)]. RESULTS: Greater anti-ulcer potential and efficiency in wound healing compared with standard agents favor BPC 157, efficient in inflammatory bowel disease (PL-14736, Pliva), given in drinking water or intraperitoneally. Even after 6-alpha-methylprednisolone aggravation, BPC 157 promptly improves both skin and stomach mucosa healing, and closure of fistulas, with no leakage after up to 20 ml water intragastrically. Standard anti-ulcer agents, after a delay, improve firstly skin healing and then stomach mucosal healing, but not fistula leaking and bursting strength (except for atropine). CONCLUSION: We conclude that BPC 157 may resolve analogous nonhealing of wounds and persistent gastric ulcers better than standard agents.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Surgical transection of the right Achilles tendon to bone area was performed in seventy two Wistar Albino male rats. Healing Achilles tendon edges were harvested at days 1-4 following the transection. Using Achilles functional index (AFI), myeloperoxidase activity, histological inflammatory cell influx and vascular index early functional recovery was evaluated. TREATMENT: Agents (stable peptide BPC 157 10 microg methylprednisolone 5 mg, normal saline 5 ml) were given alone (/kg b.w., intraperitoneally, once daily, first 30 min after surgery, last 24 h before analysis). Control group received normal saline 5 ml/kg. RESULTS: BPC 157 improved functional recovery (AFI values increased at all time points, p <0.05) by anti-inflammatory (decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological inflammatory cell influx, p <0.05) and increased new blood vessel formation (increased vascular index, p <0.05). Methyprednisolone decreased MPO activity and histological inflammatory cell influx, (p <0.05) but also decreased new blood vessel formation and did not affect early functional recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Stable peptide BPC 157 with combined anti-inflammatory action and induction of early new blood vessel formation facilitates early functional recovery in Achilles tendon to bone healing.",

      "abstract": "We report a simple novel rat model that combines prolonged esophagitis and parallel sphincters failure. The anti-ulcer gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, which was found to be stable in gastric juice, and is being evaluated in inflammatory bowel disease trials, is an anti-esophagitis therapy that recovers failed sphincters. Twelve or twenty months after the initial challenge (tubes sutured into sphincters for one week and then spontaneously removed by peristalsis), rats exhibit prolonged esophagitis (confluent hemorrhagic and yellowish lesions, thinner epithelium and superficial corneal layer, with stratification derangement); constantly lowered pressure of both sphincters (assessed by using a water manometer connected to the drainage port of a Foley catheter implanted into the stomach either through esophageal or duodenal incision); and both lower esophageal and pyloric sphincter failure. Throughout the esophagitis experiment, BPC 157 was given at either 10 micro g/kg, i.p., once a day (last application 24 h before assessment) or alternatively, it was given continuously in drinking water at 0.16 micro g/ml (12 ml/rat). This treatment recovers i) esophagitis (macroscopically and microscopically, at either region or investigated time period) and ii) pressure in both sphincters (cmH2O). In addition, BPC 157 (10 micro g/kg) or saline (1 ml/rat, 5 ml/kg) was specifically given directly into the stomach; pressure assessment was performed at 5 min thereafter. The effect of BPC 157 is specific because in normal rats, it increases lower esophageal sphincter-pressure, but decreases pyloric sphincter-pressure. Ranitidine, given as the standard drug using the same protocol (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily; 0.83 mg/ml in drinking water; or 50 mg/kg directly into the stomach) had no effect.",

Initially, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, M.W. 1419, PL-10, PLD-116, PL 14736 Pliva, Croatia; in trials for inflammatory bowel disease; wound treatment; no toxicity reported; effective alone without carrier) also superiorly accelerates the healing of transected Achilles tendon. Regularly, quadriceps muscle completely transected transversely 1.0 cm proximal to patella presents a definitive defect that cannot be compensated in rat. BPC 157 (10 microg, 10 ng, 10 pg/kg) is given intraperitoneally, once daily; the first application 30 min posttransection, the final 24 h before sacrifice. It consistently improves muscle healing throughout the whole 72-day period. Improved are: (i) biomechanic (load of failure increased); (ii) function (walking recovery and extensor postural thrust/motor function index returned toward normal healthy values); (iii) microscopy/immunochemistry [i.e., mostly muscle fibers connect muscle segments; absent gap; significant desmin positivity for ongoing regeneration of muscle; larger myofibril diameters on both sides, distal and proximal (normal healthy rat-values reached)]; (iv) macroscopic presentation (stumps connected; subsequently, atrophy markedly attenuated; finally, presentation close to normal noninjured muscle, no postsurgery leg contracture). Thus, posttransection healing-consistently improved-may suggest this peptide therapeutic application in muscle disorders.",

A stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 with very safe profile (inflammatory bowel disease clinical phase II, PL-10, PLD-116, PL-14736, Pliva) reduced the duration of immobility to a greater extent than imipramine, and, given peripherally, has region specific influence on brain 5-HT synthesis (alpha-[14C]methyl-L-tryptophan autoradiographic measurements) in rats, different from any other serotonergic drug. Thereby, we investigate this peptide (10 microg, 10 ng, 10 pg/kg i.p.) in (i) full serotonin syndrome in rat combining pargyline (irreversible MAO-inhibition; 75 mg/kg i.p.) and subsequent L-tryptophan (5-HT precursor; 100 mg/kg i.p.; BPC 157 as a co-treatment), or (ii, iii) using pargyline or L-tryptophan given separately, as a serotonin-substrate with (ii) pargyline (BPC 157 as a 15-min posttreatment) or as a potential serotonin syndrome inductor with (iii) L-tryptophan (BPC 157 as a 15 min-pretreatment). In all experiments, gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 contrasts with serotonin-syndrome either (i) presentation (i.e., particularly counteracted) or (ii) initiation (i.e., neither a serotonin substrate (counteraction of pargyline), nor an inductor for serotonin syndrome (no influence on L-tryptophan challenge)). Indicatively, severe serotonin syndrome in pargyline + L-tryptophan rats is considerably inhibited even by lower pentadecapeptide BPC 157 doses regimens (particularly disturbances such as hyperthermia and wet dog shake thought to be related to stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors), while the highest pentadecapeptide dose counteracts mild disturbances present in pargyline rats (mild hypothermia, feeble hind limbs abduction). Thereby, in severe serotonin syndrome, gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (alone, no behavioral or temperature effect) has a beneficial activity, which is likely, particular, and mostly related to a rather specific counteraction of 5-HT2A receptors phenomena.",

Because of the particular healing problems associated with laser use, we have now studied the effect of pentadecapeptide BPC 157 on CO(2) laser injuries (Sharplan 1075 laser: 20 W, distance 12.5 cm, spot size 0.8 mm and exposure time 1s) created on the dorsal skin of anaesthetised male NMRI-Hannover mice. The injury was either not treated or treated by topical application of a thin layer of neutral cream containing pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (1 microg, 1 ng or 1 pg (dissolved in saline)/g) or vehicle only, once daily, with the first application 60 min after injury and the last 24 h before killing (1, 7 and 21 days after the laser application). BPC 157 consistently improved healing after the CO(2) laser injury, both macroscopically and microscopically. The effect was produced with a simple method of application and favourable peptide stability (no carrier), and confirms the effectiveness of an ointment containing 1 microg BPC 157 (dissolved in saline)/g neutral cream.",

METHODS: Gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was administered (initial single or continuous administration) into rats either intragastrically or intramuscularly before (induced acute gastric ulcer) or after (induced chronic gastric ulcer) the applications of inducing agents, and each animal was sacrificed to observe the protective effects of BPC 157 on gastric ulcers. RESULTS: Both intramuscular (im) and intragastric (ig) administration of BPC 157 could apparently reduce the ulcer area and accelerate the healing of induced ulcer in different models and the effect of im administered BPC 157 was better than that of ig. The rats treated with higher dosages (400 ng/kg, 800 ng/kg) of BPC 157 (im and ig) showed significantly less lesion (P<0.01 vs excipient or saline control), the inhibition ratio of ulcer formation varied between 45.7% and 65.6%, from all measurements except 400 ng/kg BPC 157 in pylorus ligation induced model (P<0.05), in which the inhibition rate was 54.2%. When im administered (800 ng/kg BPC 157) in three models, the inhibition ratio of ulcer formation was 65.5%, 65.6% and 59.9%, respectively, which was better than that of famotidine (its inhibition rate was 60.8%, 57.2% and 34.3%, respectively). Continuous application of BPC 157 (in chronic acetate induced gastric ulcer) could accelerate rebuilding of glandular epithelium and formation of granulation tissue (P<0.05 at 200 ng/kg and P<0.01 at 400 ng/kg and 800 ng/kg vs excipient or saline control). CONCLUSION: Both im and ig administered gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 can apparently ameliorate acute gastric ulcer in rats and antagonize the protracted effect of acetate challenge on chronic ulcer.

      "abstract": "In studies intended to improve healing of transected Achilles tendon, effective was a stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, M.W. 1419). Currently in clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease (PLD-116, PL 14736, Pliva), it ameliorates internal and external wound healing. In rats, the right Achilles tendon transected (5 mm proximal to its calcaneal insertion) presents with a large tendon defect between cut ends. Agents (/kg b.w., i.p., once time daily) (BPC 157 (dissolved in saline, with no carrier addition) (10 microg, 10 ng or 10 pg) or saline (5.0 ml)), were firstly applied at 30 min after surgery, the last application at 24 h before autopsy. Achilles functional index (AFI) was assessed once time daily. Biomechanical, microscopical and macroscopical assessment was on day 1, 4, 7, 10 and 14. Controls generally have severely compromised healing. In comparison, pentadecapeptide BPC 157 fully improves recovery: (i) biomechanically, increased load of failure, load of failure per area and Young's modulus of elasticity; (ii) functionally, significantly higher AFI-values; (iii) microscopically, more mononuclears and less granulocytes, superior formation of fibroblasts, reticulin and collagen; (iv) macroscopically, smaller size and depth of tendon defect, and subsequently the reestablishment of full tendon integrity. Likewise, unlike TGF-beta, pentadecapeptide BPC 157, presenting with no effect on the growth of cultured cell of its own, consistently opposed 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), a negative modulator of the growth. HNE-effect is opposed in both combinations: BPC 157+HNE (HNE growth inhibiting effect reversed into growth stimulation of cultured tendocytes) and HNE+BPC 157(abolished inhibiting activity of the aldehyde), both in the presence of serum and serum deprived conditions. In conclusion, these findings, particularly, Achilles tendon transection fully recovered in rats, peptide stability suitable delivery, usefully favor gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 in future Achilles tendon therapy.",

Its effects on corticosteroid impaired healing of deep partial skin thickness burns, and burn-gastric lesions were investigated. Male NMRI-Hannover mice (sacrificed at 1-3,7,14 and 21 days following burning 20% of total burn area at the back (open flame for 7s) received intraperitoneally (per kg bw) 6alpha-methylprednisolone (Depo-medrol, 1.0 or 10.0mg), or an equal volume of saline (5.0 ml), once daily, first application 30 min after injury, last 24h before sacrifice. The injury was subsequently treated by topical application of a thin layer of pentadecapeptide BPC-157 cream at three different levels a neutral cream of no treatment. Pentadecapeptide BPC-157 consistently improved given burn healing (both microscopical and tensionmetry assessment), and counteracted corticosteroid-impairment of burn healing. In burn-gastric lesions investigation of the effects of BPC showed an anti-ulcer effect of its own in burned non-corticosteroid-treated mice and potentiated the anti-ulcer effect observed in 6alpha-methylprednisolone-treated mice. Pentadecapeptide BPC-157 inhibited corticosteroid immunosuppression. In vitro, in spleenic cells assessment, animals (sacrificed at day 21) treated with 6alpha-methylprednisolone 1mg showed decreased reactivity to nitrogen in comparison with control, healthy animals, while the addition of BPC-157 (1 microg/g cream) returned cell reactivity to values noted in control healthy animals.",

      "abstract": "The effects of the gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 were investigated when administered topically or systemically in burned mice. This agent is known to have a beneficial effect in a variety of models of gastrointestinal lesions, as well as on wound or fracture healing. Deep partial skin thickness burns (1.5x1.5 cm) covering 20% of total body area, were induced under anesthesia on the back of mice by controlled burning and gastric lesions were assessed 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days following injury. The first application of BPC 157 was immediately following burning, and thereafter, once daily, until 24 h before sacrifice. In the initial experiments, exposure to direct flame for 5 s, the BPC 157 was applied at 10 microg or 10 ng/kg b.w. intraperitoneally (i.p.) by injection or alternatively, topically, at the burn, as a thin layer of cream (50 microg of BPC 157 dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water was mixed with 50 g of commercial neutral cream (also used as local vehicle-control)), while silver sulfadiazine 1% cream was a standard agent acting locally. Others received no local medication: they were treated i.p. by injection of distilled water (distilled water-control) or left without any medication (control). In subsequent experiments involving deeper burns (direct flame for 7 s), BPC 157 creams (50 microg, 5 microg, 500 ng, 50 ng or 5 ng of BPC 157 dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water was mixed with 50 g of commercial neutral cream), or vehicle as a thin layer of cream, were applied topically, at the burn. Compared with untreated controls, in both experiments, in the BPC 157 cream-treated mice all parameters of burn healing were improved throughout the experiment: less edema was observed and inflammatory cell numbers decreased. Less necrosis was seen with an increased number of capillaries along with an advanced formation of dermal reticulin and collagen fibers. An increased number of preserved follicles were observed. Two weeks after injury, BPC 157 cream-treated mice completely reversed the otherwise poor re-epithelization ratio noted in the untreated control or mice treated with vehicle only. Tensiometry investigation showed an increased breaking strength and relative elongation of burned skin, while water content in burned skin decreased. This was, however, not the case with the vehicle or silver sulfadiazine. Relative to the control values, in silver sulfadiazine cream-treated mice, only collagen fiber formation was increased, in addition to a decreased inflammatory cell number. Relative to control values, BPC 157 given i.p. decreased the number of inflammatory cells, lowered water content in burned skin, and raised breaking strength and relative elongation of burned skin during tensiometry. Through the experimental period, gastric lesions were continuously noted in all thermally injured mice left without local medication and they were consistently attenuated only by BPC 157 treatments: either given i.p. (at either dose), or given locally (at either concentration). Other treatments (i.e. local treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream or neutral cream in mice subjected for 5 s to direct flame), led to only poor, if any attenuation. This stable gastric pentadecapeptide appears to be active and gives a stimulation to burn healing at the defect site. The agent may act by causing an upregulation of the growth factors, as well as influencing other local factors.",
