      "abstract": "Neurovascular flow-diverting stents (FDSs) are revolutionizing the paradigm for treatment of intracranial aneurysms, but they still face great challenges like post- implantation acute thrombosis and delayed reendothelialization. Surface modification is of crucial relevance in addressing such key issues. In this study, we fabricated an ultrathin nanocoating out of copper (II) together with protocatechuic acid (PCA) and nattokinase (NK) bioactive molecules on NiTi FDSs via a coordination chemistry approach, with favorable biophysiochemical interactions, to fulfill this goal. This coating was identified as covalently-anchored and compactly covering the FDSs substrate, with unique nano-structured morphology as well as superhydrophilicity. The in vitro coagulation and whole blood assays demonstrated that the modified FDS's surfaces showed improved antithrombogenicity, with reduced platelet and fibrinogen adhesion, as well as their aggregation and activation, and consequently prolonged clotting time leading to decreased thrombosis occurrence. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures confirmed the modified capability of FDSs to promote endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The ex vivo experiments verified that modified FDSs had clearly in-stent patency without thrombi formation, as compared to the bare FDSs bearing thromboembolic blockage. It was postulated that these enhanced biocompatibilities can be attributable to the copper-catalyzed nitric oxide (NO) released as a functional mediator, the nature of the PCA and NK molecules, as well as the synergic biophysiochemical surface/interface interactions. Our strategy may not only open a new avenue for surface-functionalizing neurovascular FDSs for medical purpose but also help better-understand interfacial phenomena on the advanced biomaterials.",

      "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) induced by thrombus formation is a prevalent cardiovascular disorder, and thrombolytic therapy continues to be a principal treatment modality. Prior research indicates a substantial association among MI, thrombosis, and the activation of oxidative stress pathways. The effectiveness of current thrombolytic drugs is relatively constrained, and the need for innovative and versatile thrombolytic medications remains critical. Nattokinase (NK) is a naturally-occurring enzyme known for its thrombolytic characteristics. Nonetheless, nattokinase's limited stability and susceptibility to inactivation in biological systems have impeded its clinical utility. This study designs a manganese oxide nanozyme (MnOx) loaded with NK (MnOx@NK), which exhibits both antioxidant and thrombolytic function. The administration of MnOx@NK through tail vein injection significantly restores vascular function and further reduces myocardial injury in a mouse model of myocardial infarction, demonstrating a pronounced protective effect against oxidative stress. These findings indicate that nattokinase-loaded nanozymes can be a promising approach for treating acute myocardial infarction, providing a new strategy for clinical application.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. Nattokinase is a serine protease extracellularly produced by natto, a fermented product of Bacillus subtilis var. natto. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of nattokinase in a rat model of AD induced by aluminum and D-galactose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal, vehicle, and orally administered nattokinase (NK65 and NK130 groups). Except for the normal group, all groups were treated with AlCl3 and D-galactose for 10 weeks. The NK65 and NK130 groups additionally received 65 mg/kg/day and 130 mg/kg/day nattokinase, respectively. We analyzed β-amyloid levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the spatial reference test was evaluated using the Morris water maze test. After the Morris water maze test, rats of all groups were subjected to micro-computed tomography (μCT) to assess constructional changes in the brain. Aluminum concentration and β-amyloid levels were analyzed by histochemical staining in all brain tissues. RESULTS: Oral administration of nattokinase in the AD rat model increased free-form β-amyloid levels in the CSF and improved aluminum and amyloid plaque accumulation in the brain. Brain μCT images showed enhanced brain volume with fewer constructional changes after treatment with nattokinase. In the behavioral tests, both the escape latency time in the spatial reference test and the time taken to cross the platform area in the spatial probe test improved partially. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that nattokinase has potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic nanorobots are emerging players in thrombolytic therapy due to their noninvasive remote actuation and drug loading capabilities. Although the nanorobots with a size under 100 nm are ideal to apply in microvascular systems, the propulsion performance of nanorobots is inevitably compromised due to the limited response to magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate a nattokinase-loaded magnetic vortex nanorobot (NK-MNR) with an average size around 70 nm and high saturation magnetization for mechanical propelling and thermal responsive thrombolysis under a magnetic field with dual frequencies. The nanorobots are stable in suspension and undergo the magneto-steered assembly into chain-like NK-MNRs, which are regulated to generate magnetic forces to mechanically damage and penetrate the thrombus by the low-frequency rotating magnetic field. Synergistically, enhanced magnetic hyperthermia is triggered by an alternating magnetic field of high frequency, enabling heat-induced NK release and fibrinolysis. In this dual frequency-regulated magnetothrombolysis (fRMT) strategy, nanorobots collaborate under the dual magnetic energy conversion model to achieve the vasculature recanalization rate of 81.0% in thrombotic mice. Overall, the nanorobot with the special magnetic vortex property and multimodel controls is a promising nanoplatform for in vivo focalized microvascular thrombolysis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Nattokinase (NK), a protease enzyme present in traditional fermented Japanese food, has shown fibrinolytic properties in vitro as well as in cardiac ischemia. In the present study, the Neuroprotective effect of standardized NK was evaluated in the thrombolytic focal cerebral ischemic model. METHODOLOGY: The parameters of behavioural assessment, cerebral blood flow, inflammatory mediators, excitatory amino acids, and immunohistochemistry were measured to support the NK effect. NK was administered at 150 and 300 mg/kg, and its effects were compared with streptokinase (STK) (100μl/rat). Each mg of NK contains 5.5 Units of the enzyme, which can cause lysis of the fibrin. RESULTS: The results indicate that 7 days of treatment of 300 mg NK restored the cerebral blood flow and prevented the release of cytokine and excitatory amino acids. Similarly, neurological scores were reduced, and grip strength increased significantly with NK treatment. The GFAP and synaptophysin staining of the hippocampus (CA1) and cerebrum have shown recovery of neurons from ischemic damage in comparison to vehicle-treated ischemic-reperfused rats. The NK (300 mg/kg) fibrinolytic effect is comparable to STK treatment. CONCLUSION: To conclude, NK, a serine protease, protects the brain from ischemic degeneration in thrombolytic cerebral ischemia. Consumption of this Japanese food might exhibit prophylactic activity."

      "abstract": "The use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has brought a significant progress in the management of cardiovascular diseases, considered clinically superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) particularly in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events. In addition, numerous advantages such as fixed dosing, lack of laboratory monitoring, and fewer food and drug-to-drug interactions make the use of NOACs superior to VKAs. While NOACs are synthetic drugs prescribed for specific conditions, nattokinase (NK) is a natural enzyme derived from food that has potential health benefits. Various experimental and clinical studies reported the positive effects of NK on the circulatory system, including the thinning of blood and the dissolution of blood clots. This enzyme showed not only fibrinolytic activity due to its ability to degrade fibrin, but also an affinity as a substrate for plasmin. Recent studies have shown that NK has additional cardioprotective effects, such as antihypertensive and anti-atherosclerotic effects. In this narrative review, we presented the cardioprotective properties of two different approaches that go beyond anticoagulation: NOACs and NK. By combining evidence from basic research with clinical findings, we aim to elucidate the comparative cardioprotective efficacy of these interventions and highlight their respective roles in modern cardiovascular care.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Nattokinase (NK), a potent serine endopeptidase, has exhibited a variety of pharmacological effects, including thrombolysis, anti-inflammation, and antioxidative stress. Building on previous research highlighting NK's promise in nerve regeneration, our study investigated whether NK exerted protective effects in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)-induced cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and the underlying mechanisms. Results: The rats were administered NK (5000, 10000, 20000 FU/kg, i.g., 7 days before surgery, once daily). We showed that NK treatment dose dependently reduced the infarction volume and improved neurological symptoms, decreased the proinflammatory and coagulation cytokines levels, and attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the infarcted area of tMCAO rats. We also found that NK could exert neuroprotective effects in a variety of vitro models, including the microglia inflammation model and neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model. Notably, NK effectively countered OGD/R-induced neuron death, modulating diverse pathways, including autophagy, apoptosis, PARP-dependent death, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, the neuroprotection of NK was blocked by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine endopeptidase inhibitor. We revealed that heat-inactive NK was unable to protect against tMCAO injury and other vitro models, suggesting NK attenuated ischemic injury by its enzymatic activity. We conducted a proteomic analysis and found inflammation and coagulation were involved in the occurrence of tMCAO model and in the therapeutic effect of NK. Innovation and Conclusion: In conclusion, these data demonstrated that NK had multifaceted neuroprotection in ischemic brain injury, and the therapeutic effect of NK was related with serine endopeptidase activity.

      "abstract": "AIMS: Cancer-related thrombosis (CAT) is a common complication in cancer patients, significantly impacting their quality of life and survival prospects. Nattokinase (NK) has potent thrombolytic properties, however, its efficacy is limited by low oral bioavailability and the risk of severe allergic reactions with intravenous use. Heparin (HP) is a widely used anticoagulant in clinical settings. This study aimed to overcome the intravenous toxicity of NK and explore its effect on CAT in advanced tumors. MAIN METHODS: In this study, NK-HP electrostatic complexes were constructed, and their safety and thrombolytic efficacy were verified through guinea pig allergy tests, mouse tail vein tests, and both in vivo and in vitro thrombolysis experiments. Additionally, an S180 advanced tumor model was developed and combined with sialic acid-modified doxorubicin liposomes (DOX-SAL) to investigate the impact of NK-HP on CAT and its antitumor effects in advanced tumors. KEY FINDINGS: We observed that NK-HP can eliminate the intravenous injection toxicity of NK, has strong thrombolytic performance, and can prevent thrombosis formation. Intravenous injection of NK-HP can enhance the antitumor effect of DOX-SAL by reducing the fibrin content in advanced tumors and increasing the levels of the cross-linked protein degradation product D-dimer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study developed a method to eliminate the intravenous injection toxicity of NK, proposing a promising therapeutic strategy for CAT treatment, particularly for CAT in advanced tumors, and improving the efficacy of nano-formulations in anti-tumor therapy.",

This study aims to evaluate the cardiovascular efficacy of nattokinase. METHODS: Four electronic databases were systematically searched to collect eligible randomized controlled trials. Data were extracted and summarized in a pre-designed form by two independent reviewers. Review Manager 5.4 software (Cochrane Library Software, Oxford, U.K.) was used for meta-analysis and bias risk assessment. RESULTS: Six studies were eligible for quantitative analysis with 546 participants. The overall methodological quality of included studies was high. Relatively low total dosage of nattokinase had a negative effect on blood total cholesterol (MD [mean difference] = 5.27, 95% CI [confidence intervals]: 3.74 to 6.81, p < 0.00001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = -2.76, 95% CI: -3.88 to -1.64, p < 0.00001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = 6.49, 95% CI: 0.83 to 12.15, p = 0.02). Nattokinase supplementation significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (MD = -3.45, 95% CI: -4.37 to -2.18, p < 0.00001) and diastolic blood pressure (MD = -2.32, 95% CI: -2.72 to -1.92, p < 0.00001), and led a slight increase in blood glucose (MD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.60, p < 0.0001) as compared to placebo. Nattokinase group with relatively high total dosage also had a higher total cholesterol (MD = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.29 to 4.06, p < 0.00001) than control interventions, but no significant differences were found in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. No significant correlation was found between nattokinase supplementation and triglyceride (p = 0.71). No notable adverse events were reported in all studies due to intake of nattokinase. CONCLUSIONS: This study further supports that nattokinase can be used as an effective adjunctive therapy for hypertension, but relatively low-dose supplementation of nattokinase may have no significant lipid-lowering effect. More work will need to be done to determine whether the positive efficacy of nattokinase on cardiovascular risk factors is dose-dependent.

Although NK has been recognized for its beneficial effect on humans with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the underlying mechanisms involved in vascular inflammation-atherosclerosis development remain largely unknown. The current study aimed to explore the effects of NK on gene regulation, autophagy, necroptosis and inflammasome in vascular inflammation. The transcriptional profiles of NK in endothelial cells (ECs) by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that NK affected THBS1, SRF and SREBF1 mRNA expression. In Q-PCR analysis, SRF and THBS1 were upregulated but SREBF1 was unaffected in ECs treated with NK. NK treatment induced autophagy and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome and necroptosis in ECs. Furthermore, the inhibition of SRF or THBS1 by siRNA suppressed autophagy and enhanced the NLRP3 inflammasome and necroptosis. In a mouse model, NK reduced vascular inflammation by activating autophagy and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and necroptosis. Our findings provide the first evidence that NK upregulates SRF and THBS1 genes, subsequently increasing autophagy and decreasing necroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome formation to reduce vascular inflammation. Therefore, NK could serve as nutraceuticals or adjuvant therapies to reduce vascular inflammation and possible atherosclerosis progression.",

      "abstract": "Nattokinase (NK), also known as subtilisin NAT (EC 3.4.21.62), is a serine protease produced by Bacillus subtilis natto that has anti-inflammatory and fibrinolytic properties. To study whether NK prevents the progression of pathological changes in diabetes as an inflammatory disease, we examined the effect of NK on pathological conditions in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats using the following parameters: fasting blood glucose (glucose), total plasma protein (TP), creatinine, histopathology of renal corpuscles and tubules, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and C-reactive protein (CRP). STZ-administered rats were maintained on a basic diet (CE-2) as control, low-NK diet (containing 0.2 mg NK/g diet), and high-NK diet (0.6 mg NK/g diet) for 14 days. High-dose NK significantly inhibited both glycogen deposition in the renal tubules and increase in the circulating AGE levels without downregulating glucose levels. Compared with the control group, the group treated with the high-NK diet presented a significant inhibition of the increase in the circulating CRP level on day 7 after the beginning of the treatment. However, the CRP level in the NK-H group reached the same level as that in the control group on Day 14. AGEs are known to induce CRP expression in hepatocytes, but the increase in CRP levels in our animal model was independent on the circulating AGE levels. In contrast, low-dose NK did not suppress changes in these parameters. Our present study suggests that NK suppresses glycogen deposition in renal tubules in a dose-dependent manner by the downregulation of AGE formation under hyperglycaemia in the rats with STZ-induced short-term diabetes. However, it is unclear whether this downregulation is caused by intact NK or peptides derived from NK during its digestion in the digestive tract."

However, its effective delivery remains demanding because of stability and bioavailability problems owing to its high molecular weight and proteineous nature. In this research, we have developed novel NK-loaded nontargeted liposomes (NK-LS) and targeted liposomes (RGD-NK-LS and AM-NK-LS) by the reverse phase evaporation method. The physiochemical characterizations (particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and morphology) were performed by a Zetasizer, SEM, TEM, and AFM. The Bradford assay and XPS analysis confirmed the successful surface conjugation of the targeting ligands. Platelet interaction studies by CLSM, photon imager optima, and flow cytometry showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) platelet binding affinity of targeted liposomes. In vitro evaluations were performed using human blood and a fibrinolysis study by CLSM imaging demonstrating the potent antithrombotic efficacy of AM-NK-LS. Furthermore, bleeding and clotting time studies revealed that the targeted liposomes were free from any bleeding complications. Moreover, the in vivo FeCl3 model on Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using a Doppler flow meter and ultrasound/photoacoustic imaging indicated the increased % thrombolysis and potent affinity of targeted liposomes toward the thrombus site. Additionally, in vitro hemocompatibility and histopathology studies demonstrated the safety and biocompatibility of the nanoformulations.",

This study aims to examine the effect of nattokinase monascus supplements (NMSs) on cardiovascular biomarkers and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in patients with dyslipidemia. A total of 113 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive either NMSs or a placebo (55 and 58, respectively). After a 120-day intervention, there were significant mean absolute changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and low-density cholesterol to high-density cholesterol ratio (LDL-C to HDL-C ratio), with values of -0.52 (95% CI: -0.51 to -0.54) mmol/L, -0.43 (95% CI: -0.45 to -0.41) mmol/L, -0.52 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.52) mmol/L, and -0.29 (95% CI: -0.30 to -0.28) mmol/L, respectively, between the two groups. However, no significant differences were found in triglycerides (TGs), high-density cholesterol (HDL-C), and CIMT. Furthermore, the results for lipids and CIMT remained essentially unchanged after adjusting for various confounding factors using the analysis of covariance model. There were no significant differences in coagulation, liver function, renal function, or other indicators. No intervention-related adverse events, such as mouth ulcers, drooling, and stomach pain, were reported. The study results demonstrate that NMSs can ameliorate lipid levels (TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and the LDL-C to HDL-C ratio) without the occurrence of adverse events. However, it did not significantly affect serum TG, HDL-C, and CIMT.",

In the field of medicine, nattokinase has been developed as an adjuvant drug for the treatment of thrombosis, and nattokinase-rich beverages and health foods have also shown great potential in the field of food development. At present, the poor thermostability of nattokinase limits its industrial production and application. In this study, we used several thermostability-prediction algorithms to predict nattokinase from Bacillus mojavensis LY-06 (AprY), and screened two variants S33T and T174V with increased thermostability and fibrinolytic activity. The t1/2 of S33T and T174V were 8.87-fold and 2.51-fold those of the wild type AprY, respectively, and their enzyme activities were also increased (1.17-fold and 1.28-fold, respectively). Although the thermostability of N218L was increased by 2.7 times, the fibrinolytic activity of N218L was only 73.3% of that of wild type AprY. The multiple-point mutation results showed that S33T-N218L and S33T-T174V-N218L variants lost their activity, and the T174V-N218L variant did not show any significant change in catalytic performance, while S33T-T174V increased its thermostability and activity by 21.3% and 24.8%, respectively. Although the S33T-T174V variant did not show the additive effect of thermostability, it combined the excellent transient thermostability of S33T with the better thrombolytic activity of T174V. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the overall structure of S33T and T174V variants tended to be stable, while the structure of S33T-T174V variant was more flexible. Local structure analysis showed that the increased rigidity of the active center region (positions 64-75) and the key loop region (positions 129-130, 155-163, 187-192, 237-241, and 268-270) determined the increased thermostability of all variants. In addition, the enhanced flexibility of S33T-T174V variant in the Ca1 binding region (positions 1-4, 75-82) and the peripheral region of the catalytic pocket (positions 210-216) may account for the inability to superpose its thermostability. We explored the effective strategy to enhance the thermostability of nattokinase, and the resulting variants have potential industrial production and application."

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a single dose of NK on changes in skin temperature after cold water immersion. A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover intervention study was performed on nine healthy men. The participants were randomised to receive either a single dose of 2,000 fibrinolytic units (FU) of NK or a placebo with subsequent crossover. Two hours after supplementation, the participants immersed both hands in a water bath maintained at 10 °C for 1 min. Skin temperature, perceived coldness, cardiac output, and sympathetic nervous activity were measured before, during, and after water immersion. Two-way analysis of variance showed a significant effect of treatment interaction on the skin temperature of the middle finger, palm, and back of the right hand (p < 0.05). These findings represented that the skin temperatures of the middle finger, palm, and back of the right hand immersed in the cold water were significantly dropped due to the cold water immersion, and then recovered more quickly by NK intake than by placebo intake. The results of the current study highlight the potential implications of NK for the prevention of excessive vasoconstriction. It may be more significant for those with cold-sensitive constitution, such as women and elderly. In contrast, the acute administration of 2,000 FU of NK did not affect changes in heart rate, cardiac output, sympathetic nervous activity compared with a placebo in healthy men."

We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of nattokinase (NK) for early DR and the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: A mouse model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin was utilized and NK was administered via intravitreal injection. Microvascular abnormities were evaluated by examining the leakage from blood-retinal barrier dysfunction and loss of pericytes. Retinal neuroinflammation was examined through the assessment of glial activation and leukostasis. The level of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and its downstream signaling molecules was evaluated following NK treatment. RESULTS: NK administration significantly improved the blood-retinal barrier function and rescued pericyte loss in the diabetic retinas. Additionally, NK treatment inhibited diabetes-induced gliosis and inflammatory response and protected retinal neurons from diabetes-induced injury. NK also improved high glucose-induced dysfunction in cultured human retinal micrangium endothelial cells. Mechanistically, NK regulated diabetes-induced inflammation partially by modulating HMGB1 signaling in the activated microglia. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the protective effects of NK against microvascular damages and neuroinflammation in the streptozotocin-induced DR model, suggesting that NK could be a potential pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of DR."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal accumulation of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neuronal damage. Although AD is typically considered a cognitive neurodegenerative disorder, almost all people diagnosed with AD develop neuropsychiatric complications at some stage in their life span. The present study investigated the effect of chronic Nattokinase (NK) administration on β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ1-42) induced neuropsychiatric conditions (depression-like behaviour, anxiety, and memory impairment) in mice. Aβ1-42 peptide injected mice demonstrated depression, anxiety, and impairment of cognitive abilities evaluated as increased immobility time in forced swim test (FST), decreased open arm time/entries in elevated plus maze (EPM) and reference and working memory error in radial arm maze (RAM) respectively with elevation in Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), reduction in Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunocontent within the hippocampus. Chronic administration of NK (50-100 mg/kg, i.p.) from day 8-27, prevented depression-like behaviour, anxiety, and memory impairment and normalized the neurochemical alteration within the hippocampus of mice injected with Aβ1-42 peptide. The effect of NK on psychiatric complications, learning, and memory was comparable to peripheral donepezil treatment. This study suggests that NK improves learning, memory impairment, and neuropsychiatric complications possibly through the downregulation of neuroinflammatory pathways and restoring BDNF signalling in AD.",

      "abstract": "The therapy of solid tumors is always hampered by the intrinsic tumor physical microenvironment (TPME) featured with compact and rigid extracellular matrix (ECM) microstructures. Herein, we introduce nattokinase (NKase), a thrombolytic healthcare drug, to comprehensively regulate the TPME for versatile enhancement of various therapy modalities. Intratumoral injection of NKase not only degrades the major ECM component fibronectin but also inhibits cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in generating fibrosis, resulting in decreased tumor stiffness, enhanced perfusion, and hypoxia alleviation. The NKase-mediated regulation of the TPME significantly promotes the tumoral accumulation of therapeutic agents, leading to efficient chemotherapy without inducing side effects. Additionally, the enhancement of tumor radiotherapy based on radiosensitizers was also achieved by the pretreatment of intratumorally injected NKase, which could be ascribed to the elevated oxygen saturation level in NKase-treated tumors. Moreover, a xenografted human breast MDB-MA-231 tumor model is established to evaluate the influence of NKase on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, illustrating that the pretreatment of NKase could boost the infiltration of CAR-T cells into tumors and thus be a benefit for tumor inhibition. These findings demonstrate the great promise of the NKase-regulated TPME as a translational strategy for universal enhancement of therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors by various treatments.",

Nattokinase is essential for the lysis of blood clots and the treatment of cardiac diseases including atherosclerosis, thrombosis, high blood pressure, and stroke. The demand for thrombolytic drugs rises as the prevalence of cardiovascular disease rises, and nattokinase is particularly effective for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases due to its long duration of action. In this study, we cloned the nattokinase gene from the Bacillus subtilis strain into the pET32a vector and expressed the protein in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The active recombinant nattokinase was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and then evaluated for fibrinolytic and blood clot lysis activity. Physiological parameters for optimizing protein production at optimal pH, temperature, IPTG concentration, and incubation time were investigated. A statistical technique was used to optimize media components for nattokinase overproduction, and Central Composite Design-Response Surface Methodology-based optimization was used to select significant components for protein production. The optimized media produced 1805.50 mg/L of expressed nattokinase and 42.80 gm/L of bacterial mass. The fibrinolytic activity obtained from refolded native protein was 58FU/mg, which was five times higher than the available orokinase drug (11FU/mg). The efficiency with which a statistical technique for media optimization was implemented improved recombinant nattokinase production and provides new information for scale - up nattokinase toward industrial applications.",

In light of its advanced beneficial cardiovascular effects and its nature as a serine protease, characterizing its biological substrates is essential for informing and ultimately delineating the molecular mechanism of its thrombolytic and anticoagulant activities that will unlock the powerful strategic design of effective therapies for CVDs. Given the efficacy of NK to break the vicious loop between inflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombosis, and the extensive role of thrombin in the loop, a stepwise computational strategy was developed to investigate the cleavage events of NK, including both a protein-protein complex model for protein substrate recognition and a protease-peptide complex model for the cleavage site identification, whereby their contact region was sited to allow for the prediction of the corresponding cleavage site that was successfully verified by both mass spectrometry (MS)-based N-terminal sequencing and various functional assays. Collectively, thrombin was predicted and identified to be a novel biological substrate of NK, which expanded the comprehensive antithrombus mechanism of NK via breaking the vicious loop between inflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombosis. This study not only provided insight into the interaction characteristics between NK and its hydrolytic substrate for a better understanding toward its catalytic mechanism but also developed a comprehensive computational strategy to elucidate the proteolytic targets of NK for the breakthrough of feature drug development.",

The nattokinase/ovalbumin-naringenin hydrogel had the strongest hardness and springiness. All nattokinase/ovalbumin-flavonoids hydrogels were more elastic than viscous. After in vitro digestion, the thrombolytic capacities of all nattokinase/ovalbumin-flavonoids hydrogels were significantly higher than that of free nattokinase. Moreover, nattokinase/ovalbumin-flavonoids hydrogels showed higher thermal and pH stability than free nattokinase. Fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking analysis revealed that the main interactions between nattokinase and daidzein, nattokinase and genistein were mainly hydrogen bond, while the main interactions between nattokinase and naringin, nattokinase and puerarin, nattokinase and naringenin were hydrophobic interaction.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nattokinase (NK) is a promising alternative in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases due to its potent fibrinolytic activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of crude nattokinase extract on the healing of acetic acid-induced oral mucositis in mice. METHODS: Bacillus subtilis culture media (BSCM) was isolated into the supernatant, named nattokinase crude extract (NCE), and the pellet was named Bacillus subtilis mass (BSM). An oral mucositis model was established in mice by applying 50% glacial acetic acid to the buccal mucosa. According to the treatment conditions, the mice were divided into BSCM, NCE, BSM and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) groups. The weight of the mice, oral mucositis healing score and histopathological examination were used to evaluate the treatment. RESULTS: Fibrinolytic activities of BSCM, NCE and BSM were approximately 8069, 10,800 and 80 U/ml, respectively. The weight gain of mice in the NCE group was significantly different from the PBS group after three days' treatment (p < 0.05). The oral mucositis score of NCE group was significantly higher than other groups (p < 0.05). The differences in histopathology scores between the NCE and other groups were statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: NCE could possess remarkable potential to reduce pain and promote oral mucositis healing with minimal safety concerns. In this study, we first report that NCE from the supernatant of Bacillus subtilis can promote the healing of oral mucositis, which extends the application scope of NK.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Even though tofu is a traditional Chinese food loved by Asian people the wastewater generated during the production of tofu can pollute the environment, and the treatment of this generated wastewater can increase the operating cost of the plant. In this study, the production of nattokinase could be achieved by using the nitrogen source in tofu processing wastewater (TPW) instead of using the traditional nattokinase medium. This meets the need for the low-cost fermentation of nattokinase and at the same time addresses the environmental pollution concerns caused by the wastewater. Bacillus subtilis 13,932 is, a high yielding strain of nattokinase, which is stored in our laboratory. To increase the activity of nattokinase in the tofu process wastewater fermentation medium, the medium components and culture parameters were optimized. Nattokinase with high enzymatic activity was obtained in 7 L and 100 L bioreactors when TPW was used as the sole nitrogen source catalyzed by Bacillus subtilis. Such a result demonstrates that the production of nattokinase from TPW fermentation using B. subtilis can be implemented at an industrial level. RESULTS: The peptide component in TPW is a crucial factor in the production of nattokinase. Box-Behnken design (BBD) experiments were designed to optimize various critical components, i.e., Glucose, TPW, MgSO4·7H2O, CaCl2, in nattokinase fermentation media. A maximum nattokinase activity was recorded at 37 °C, pH 7.0, 70 mL liquid medium, and 200 rpm. The highest nattokinase activities obtained from 7 to 100 L bioreactors were 8628.35 ± 113.87 IU/mL and 10,661.97 ± 72.47 IU/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: By replacing the nitrogen source in the original medium with TPW, there was an increase in the enzyme activity by 19.25% after optimizing the medium and culture parameters. According to the scale-up experiment from conical flasks to 100 L bioreactors, there was an increase in the activity of nattokinase by 47.89%.",

Participants with fasting serum glucose concentrations of 100-140 mg/dL were recruited and randomly assigned to an AGM or placebo group. Participants of the AGM group (n = 40) were given an AGM granule containing 4 g of freeze-dried Aronia, red ginseng, shiitake mushroom, and nattokinase (3.4: 4.1: 2.4: 0.1 w/w) twice daily for 12 weeks, and the placebo group participants (n = 40) were provided with corn starch granules identical in appearance, weight, and flavor for 12 weeks. Serum glucose and insulin concentrations were measured during oral-glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) after administering 75 g of glucose in a fasted state. HOMA-IR, liver damage, and inflammation indices were determined, and safety parameters and adverse reactions were assessed. As determined by OGTT, serum glucose concentrations were not significantly different between the AGM and placebo groups after the intervention. However, changes in serum insulin concentrations in the fasted state and Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index after the intervention were significantly lower in the AGM group than in the placebo group (-3.07 ± 7.06 vs. 0.05 ± 6.12, p = 0.043 for serum insulin; -0.85 ± 2.14 vs. 0.07 ± 1.92, p = 0.049 for HOMA-IR). Serum adiponectin concentrations were reduced by intervention in the placebo group but not in the AGM group. Changes in liver damage indexes, including serum activities of the γ-glutamyl transferase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, were lower in the AGM group and significantly reduced in the AGM group more than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Changes in serum high sensitive-C-reactive protein concentrations in AGM and placebo groups were significantly different (-0.12 ± 0.81 vs. 0.51 ± 1.95, p = 0.06). In conclusion, AGM possibly improves insulin sensitivity and β-cell function and reduces liver damage and inflammation in prediabetic adults."

Even if it could be used for the treatment of several diseases, no data have been published supporting its use patients who underwent vascular surgery. In this study, we evaluated both the efficacy and the safety of nattokinase (100 mg/day per os) in patients admitted to vascular surgery. Patients were of both sexes, >18 years of age, with vascular diseases (i.e., deep vein thrombosis, superficial vein thrombosis, venous insufficiency), and naïve to specific pharmacological treatments (anticoagulants or anti-platelets). Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1: patients with deep vein thrombosis, treated with fondaparinux plus nattokinase. Group 2: patients with phlebitis, treated with enoxaparin plus nattokinase. Group 3: patients with venous insufficiency after classical surgery, treated with nattokinase one day later. During the study, we enrolled 153 patients (age 22-92 years), 92 females (60.1%) and 61 males (39.9%;), and documented that nattokinase was able to improve the clinical symptoms (p < 0.01) without the development of adverse drug reactions or drug interactions. Among the enrolled patients, during follow-up, we did not record new cases of vascular diseases. Attention to patients' clinical evolution, monitoring of the INR, and timely and frequent adjustment of dosages represent the cornerstones of the safety of care for patients administered fibrinolytic drugs as a single treatment or in pharmacological combination. Therefore, we can conclude that the use of nattokinase represents an efficient and safe treatment able to both prevent and treat patients with vascular diseases.",

Here, we reported an antineovascular effect of NK against experimental retinal neovascularization. METHODS: The inhibitory effect of NK against retinal neovascularization was evaluated using an oxygen-induced retinopathy murine model. Expressions of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and glial activation in the NK-treated retinae were measured. We also investigated cell proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after NK administration. RESULTS: NK treatment significantly attenuated retinal neovascularization in the OIR retinae. Consistently, NK suppressed VEGF-induced cell proliferation and migration in a concentration-dependent manner in cultured vascular endothelial cells. NK ameliorated ischemic retinopathy partially via activating Nrf2/HO-1. In addition, NK orchestrated reactive gliosis and promoted microglial activation toward a reparative phenotype in ischemic retina. Treatment of NK exhibited no cell toxicity or anti-angiogenic effects in the normal retina. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the anti-angiogenic effect of NK against retinal neovascularization via modulating Nrf2/HO-1, glial activation and neuroinflammation, suggesting a promising alternative treatment strategy for retinal neovascularization.",

However, no large-scale, long-term cardiovascular study has been conducted with nattokinase supplementation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of nattokinase on subclinical atherosclerosis progression and atherothrombotic biomarkers. METHODS: In this double-blinded trial, 265 individuals of median age 65.3 years, without clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were randomized to oral nattokinase 2,000 fibrinolytic units or matching placebo. Primary outcome was rate of change in subclinical atherosclerosis measured by serial carotid ultrasound every 6 months as carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid arterial stiffness (CAS). Additional outcomes determined at least every 6 months were clinical parameters including blood pressure and laboratory measures including metabolic factors, blood rheology parameters, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis factors, inflammatory markers and monocyte/macrophage cellular activation markers. RESULTS: After median 3 years of randomized treatment, annualized rate of change in CIMT and CAS did not significantly differ between nattokinase supplementation and placebo. Additionally, there was no significant effect of nattokinase supplementation on blood pressure or any laboratory determination. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this trial show that nattokinase supplementation has a null effect on subclinical atherosclerosis progression in healthy individuals at low risk for CVD.",

Nattokinase (NK) is an extract from a popular Japanese food, natto, which consists of boiled soybeans fermented with bacteria. Nattokinase exerts strong fibrinolytic and thrombolytic activities and can unblock blood vessels. To deliver NK to thrombus sites in tumors, we modified the surface of NK with polysialic acid (PSA), which formed complexes via electrostatic interactions, resulting in NK-PSA. Particle size and zeta potential of NK-PSA were evaluated, and differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and morphological analyses of NK-PSA were performed. To determine the efficacy of the NK-PSA complex on delivery of nanoparticulate drugs, sialic acid-modified doxorubicin liposomes (DOX-SAL) were used as a model drug. In vivo pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution analyses showed that the blood clearance rate of DOX-SAL was significantly enhanced by NK-PSA, and NK-PSA increased accumulation of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) labeled SAL (DiR-SAL) in tumors. Analysis of anti-tumor efficacy showed that the combination of NK-PSA and DOX-SAL enhanced anti-tumor activity. These results suggested that NK-PSA combined with DOX-SAL may be an effective strategy to clear CAT and increase the ability of nanoparticles and immune cells to reach tumors.",

Nattokinase and t-PA delayed thrombus formation, near-fully (> 90%) inhibiting at 75 and 8.5 mg/kg, respectively. As adverse effects, t-PA induced petechial haemorrhage at 10 mg/kg in the lungs and thymus, and extensive bleeding at 20 mg/kg. Nattokinase also caused pulmonary haemorrhage from 300 mg/kg. Collectively, the standard safety margins (SSMs) for t-PA and nattokinase were calculated to be 1.2 and 4.0, respectively. Combinational treatment with dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) increased the efficacy and safety of t-PA and nattokinase, widening their SSMs to 2.4 and 8.0, respectively. The results indicate that nattokinase delayed thrombus formation and dissolved thrombi, and that nattokinase could be a good candidate anti-thrombotic agent with relatively-low haemorrhagic risk."

Therefore, the prevention and treatment of CVDs has become an important subject. In this study, we verified the thrombolytic activities of a nattokinase-like protease named NK-01 in vivo. Label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique was used in our study. NK-01 could inhibit the activity of coagulation factors though the up-regulation of proteinase C inhibitors and protein S. NK-01 also could inhibit the angiotensinogen conversion to AngII and promote the degradation of kininogen to reduce the blood pressure. In addition, NK-01 could increase the content of paraoxonase 1, which could prevent atherosclerosis. In our study, we found that NK-01 cloud effect some key proteins which participant in CVDs associated metabolic processes such as coagulation system, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. Taken together, the underlying molecular mechanisms for the biological beneficial of NK-01 were investigated. Our proteomic study will provide further theoretical basis for application of NK in prevention or adjuvant treatment in biomedicine areas."

In this study, we assessed the effects of NK on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a principal malignancy of the liver that causes morbidity and mortality worldwide. Crude extracts of NK (NCE) were isolated from fermentation medium by centrifugation and separated into three fractions (<10 K, 100~30 K and >30K). Orthotopic HCC mouse models were established and NCE was administered by oral gavage. H&E staining was performed to examine the pathology of HCC livers. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate FOXM1, CD31, CD44 and vimentin expression in the liver. Compared to PBS groups, NCE increased the survival rates of HCC-bearing mice to 31% and decreased ascites. Low-intensity ultrasound imaging showed that the hypoechoic mass area was lower in NCE-treated mice and that tumor growth significantly decreased. IHC staining showed that the expression of FOXM1 was inhibited by NCE treatment. Immunofluorescence results revealed lower levels of CD31, CD44 and vimentin in the NCE groups. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NCE from Bacillus subtilis natto improves survival and inhibits tumor growth in HCC mice.",

Subjects presenting with hypercholesterolemia (serum cholesterol: 200-280 mg dL-1) were randomly divided into nattokinase and placebo groups (n = 50, respectively). No significant between-group differences were found at baseline in collagen-epinephrine closure time (C-EPI CT), prothrombin time (PT), or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). After 8 weeks of treatment, the nattokinase group exhibited significant increases in C-EPI CT, PT, and aPTT. The nattokinase group showed significantly greater increases in C-EPI CT (P = 0.001) and aPTT (P = 0.016) than the placebo group. Moreover, at 8 weeks, the nattokinase group showed a significantly higher C-EPI CT than the placebo group (P = 0.001). Additionally, a significant correlation between PT and aPTT was observed (r = 0.491, P < 0.001). In conclusion, nattokinase supplementation was associated with prolonged C-EPI CT and aPTT in nondiabetic and borderline-to-moderate hypercholesterolemic subjects.",

Extensive work has been done to improve its production for the food industry. The aim of our study was to enhance NK production by tandem promoters in Bacillus subtilis WB800. RESULTS: Six recombinant strains harboring different plasmids with a single promoter (PP43, PHpaII, PBcaprE, PgsiB, PyxiE or PluxS) were constructed, and the analysis of the fibrinolytic activity showed that PP43 and PHpaII exhibited a higher expression activity than that of the others. The NK yield that was mediated by PP43 and PHpaII reached 140.5 ± 3.9 FU/ml and 110.8 ± 3.6 FU/ml, respectively. These promoters were arranged in tandem to enhance the expression level of NK, and our results indicated that the arrangement of promoters in tandem has intrinsic effects on the NK expression level. As the number of repetitive PP43 or PHpaII increased, the expression level of NK was enhanced up to the triple-promoter, but did not increase unconditionally. In addition, the repetitive core region of PP43 or PHpaII could effectively enhance NK production. Eight triple-promoters with PP43 and PHpaII in different orders were constructed, and the highest yield of NK finally reached 264.2 ± 7.0 FU/ml, which was mediated by the promoter PHpaII-PHpaII-PP43. The scale-up production of NK that was promoted by PHpaII-PHpaII-PP43 was also carried out in a 5-L fermenter, and the NK activity reached 816.7 ± 30.0 FU/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrated that NK was efficiently overproduced by tandem promoters in Bacillus subtilis. The highest fibrinolytic activity was promoted by PHpaII-PHpaII-PP43, which was much higher than that had been reported in previous studies. These multiple tandem promoters were used successfully to control NK expression and might be useful for improving the expression level of the other genes.",

For NK to be applied as an oral medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, it must overcome the extremely acidic environments of the gastrointestinal tract despite its limited acidic stability. In this study, three strategies were adopted to improve the acid resistance of NK: (a) Surface charge engineering, (b) sequence alignment, and (c) mutation based on the literature. Eleven variants were constructed and four single-point mutations were screened out for their distinctive catalytic properties: Q59E increased the specific activity; S78T improved the acid stability; Y217K enhanced the acid and thermal stabilities; and N218D improved the thermostability. Based on these observations, multipoint variants were constructed and characterized, and one variant with better acid stability, catalytic efficiency, and thermostability was obtained. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to clarify the molecular mechanism of the increased stability of S78T and Y217K mutants under acidic conditions. This study explored effective strategies to engineer acid resistance of NK; moreover, the NK variants with better catalytic properties found in this study have potential applications for the medical industry.",

The present study aimed to produce a soluble nattokinase in low cost media, which has with high activity and resistance to metal ions, detergents, and organic solvents, and can be easily used in medicines or as detergents. METHODS: Generally, most of the native extracellular proteins, such as nattokinase from Bacillus subtilis, are lysed by secretory proteases. One way for solving this problem is to employ other hosts for nattokinase production. For producing secretory form of nattokinase from Bacillus subtilis, different factors such as a suitable host, optimized media for the maximum enzyme activity and easy purification are important. RESULTS: These factors are studied in this investigation. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), as a reliable host was selected for a high yield production of an extracellular recombinant nattokinase. A mature nattokinase gene from Bacillus subtilis 1023, was cloned in the expression vector pET22b by which the host was transformed. The recombinant nattokinase was expressed through induction with IPTG. The expressed protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and its fibrinolytic activity was assayed on the fibrin plates. Afterwards, the enzyme was purified by Ni-NTA native affinity column. Different media components were evaluated for maximum nattokinase production and activity. The highest enzyme activity of 883.107 U/ml was obtained, when a medium approximately consisting of yeast extract (4.38 g/L), tryptone (4 g/L), K2HPO4 (1.61 g/L) and CaCl2 (0.01 g/L) was used. CONCLUSION: Entrapping the transformed host in calcium alginate could lead to more enzyme activity and decrease media cost.",

Nattokinase (NK), the most active ingredient of natto, possesses a variety of favourable cardiovascular effects and the consumption of Natto has been linked to a reduction in CVD mortality. Recent research has demonstrated that NK has potent fibrinolytic activity, antihypertensive, anti-atherosclerotic, and lipid-lowering, antiplatelet, and neuroprotective effects. This review covers the major pharmacologic effects of NK with a focus on its clinical relevance to CVD. It outlines the advantages of NK and the outstanding issues pertaining to NK pharmacokinetics. Available evidence suggests that NK is a unique natural compound that possesses several key cardiovascular beneficial effects for patients with CVD and is therefore an ideal drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of CVD. Nattokinase is a promising alternative in the management of CVD."

      "abstract": "Nattokinase (NK), which has been identified as a potent fibrinolytic protease, has remarkable potential in treatment of thrombolysis, and even has the ability to ameliorate chronic vein thrombosis. To reduce the hemorrhagic risk from an intravenous injection of NK, nattokinase-tauroursodeoxycholate (NK-TUDCA) complex was prepared at different pH values and with different ratios of NK and TUDCA. When assessing survival time, survival state, tail injury, and the body weight of mice, it was found that the NK-TUDCA complex (NK: 10 kIU/ml; TUDCA: 10 mg/ml; pH 5.0) had a lower toxicity when administered at an NK dosage of 130 kIU/kg in the acute toxicity test and 13 kIU/kg in the repeated low-dose challenge. From the results of the in vitro thrombolytic test and characterization of NK-TUDCA, we speculated that the delayed release of NK-TUDCA might be the main cause of toxicity reduction by the complex. This study described the preparation of an NK complex with low toxicity following intravenous administration, which could be utilized for further clinical study of NK."

      "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, globally there are around 18 million patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this number is expected to double by 2025. The pathophysiology of AD includes selective deposition of Aβ peptide in the mitochondria of cells, which inhibits uptake of glucose by neurons and key enzyme functions. Current drug treatments for AD are unable to rectify the underlying pathology of the disease; they only provide short-term symptomatic relief, so there is a need for the development of newer treatment regimes. The antiamyloid activity, antifibrinolytic activity, and antithrombotic activity of nattokinase holds potential for the treatment of AD. As nattokinase is a protein, its stability restricts its usage to a greater extent, but this limitation can be overcome by nanoencapsulation. In this work, we successfully synthesized polymeric nanoparticles of nattokinase and characterized its use by different techniques: transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, DTS Nano, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thioflavin T-binding assay, in vitro drug release, antifibrinolytic activity, and in vivo antiamyloid activity. As brain targeting of hydrophilic drugs is complicated due to the stringent nature of blood-brain barrier, in the current experimental study, we conjugated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-encapsulated nattokinase with Tet1 peptide, which exhibits retrograde transportation properties because of its affinity to neurons. Our study suggests that PLGA-encapsulated nattokinase polymeric nanoparticles are able to downregulate amyloid aggregation and exhibit antifibrinolytic activity. The encapsulation of nattokinase in PLGA did not affect its enzyme activity, so the prepared nanoformulation containing nattokinase can be used as an effective drug treatment against AD.",

Methods: All enrolled patients were from the Out-Patient Clinic of the Department of TCM at the 3(rd) Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Using randomised picking method, all patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, NK and Statin (ST) group. NK Group-patients were given NK at a daily dose of 6 000 FU and ST Group-patients were treated with statin (simvastatin 20 mg) daily. The treatment course was 26 weeks. CCA-IMT, carotid plaque size and blood lipid profile of the patients were measured before and after treatment. Results: A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the study and 76 patients (NK 39, ST 37) completed the study. Following the treatments for 26 weeks, there was a significant reduction in CCA-IMT and carotid plaque size in both groups compared with the baseline before treatment. The carotid plaque size and CCA-IMT reduced from(0.25±0.12)cm(2) to (0.16±0.10)cm(2) and from (1.13±0.12)mm to (1.01±0.11)mm, repectively. The reduction in the NK group was significantly profound (P<0.01, 36.6% reduction in plaque size in NK group versus 11.5% change in ST group). Both treatments reduced total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG). While the reduction in both groups was shown to be statistically significant (P<0.01), the reduction of TC, LDL-C and TG in ST group was significantly greater (P<0.05). In addition, NK significantly increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P<0.05), in contrast, HDL-C in the ST group did not change. The lipid lowering effect observed in the NK group was not correlated to the reduction of CCA-IMT and carotid artery plaque size (r=0.35, P=0.09). Conclusions: Our findings from this pioneer clinical study suggests that daily NK supplementation is an effective way to manage the progression of atherosclerosis and potentially may be a better alternative to statins which are commonly used to reduce atherosclerosis and further to prevent cardiovascular attack and stroke in patients. The mechanism underlying the reduction of carotid atherosclerosis by NK may be independent from its lipid-lowering effect, which is different from that of statins.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is often comorbid with asthma and resistant to therapeutic interventions. We recently reported that excessive fibrin deposition caused by impairment of fibrinolysis might play pivotal role in forming nasal polyp. Nattokinase (NK), a serine protease produced by Bacillus subtilis, has been reported to be a strong fibrinolytic enzyme. NK could be a promising drug candidate for use in the treatment of both CRSwNP and asthma. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of NK on nasal polyp tissues from patients with CRSwNP. The nasal discharge from patients with CRSwNP and sputum from subjects with asthma were also used to investigate whether NK influences the viscosity of mucus. METHODS: To examine the effects on NK on nasal polyp tissues, pieces of nasal polyps were incubated either with saline or NK (10-1000 FU/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h. We assessed the presence of fibrin in nasal polyp tissue incubated with NK by means of immunohistochemistry. To examine the effects of NK on nasal discharge and sputum from patients with CRSwNP and asthma, respectively, were incubated with NK solution at 37 °C for 1 h. RESULTS: NK effectively shrinks the nasal polyp tissue through fibrin degradation. We also found that the viscosity of the nasal discharge and sputum from patients with CRSwNP and asthma, respectively, was significantly reduced by incubation with NK solution. CONCLUSIONS: NK may be an effective alternative therapeutic option in patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma by causing fibrin degradation.",

Multiple NK genes have been cloned, characterized, and produced in various expression system studies. Recombinant technology represents a promising approach for the production of NK with high purity for its use in antithrombotic applications. This review covers the history, benefit, safety, and production of NK. Opportunities for utilizing plant systems for the large-scale production of NK, or for the production of edible plants that can be used to provide oral delivery of NK without extraction and purification are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Nattokinase is an important fibrinolytic enzyme with therapeutic applications for cardiovascular diseases. The full-length and mature nattokinase genes were cloned from Bacillus subtilis var. natto and expressed in pQE30 vector in Escherichia coli. The full-length gene expressed low nattokinase activity in the intracellular soluble and the medium fractions. The mature gene expressed low soluble nattokinase activity and large amount insoluble protein in inclusion bodies without enzyme activity. Large amount of refolding solutions (RSs) at different pH values were screening and RS-10 and RS-11 at pH 9 were selected to refold nattokinase inclusion bodies. The recombinant cells were lysed with 0.1mg/mL lysozyme and ultrasonic treatment. After centrifugation, the pellete was washed twice with 20mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100 to purify the inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in water at pH 12.0 and refolded with RS-10. The refolded proteins showed 42.8IU/mg and 79.3IU/mg fibrinolytic activity by the traditional dilution method (20-fold dilution into RS-10) and the directly mixing the protein solution with equal volume RS-10, respectively, compared to the 52.0IU/mg of total water-soluble proteins from B. subtilis var. natto. This work demonstrated that the inclusion body of recombinant nattokinase expressed in E. coli could be simply refolded to the natural enzyme activity level by directly mixing the protein solution with equal volume refolding solution.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy has become a conventional treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), yet currently, clinically prescribed thrombolytic drugs have problems such as delayed action and other side effects. Fibrinolytic enzymes have attracted interest as thrombolytic agents because of their efficiency in the fibrinolytic process, including plasmin activation. Nattokinase (NK) is a potent fibrinolytic agent for thrombosis therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to enhance the production of NK from Pseudomonas aeruginosa CMSS by media optimization and strain improvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a potent NK-producing strain was isolated from cow milk and identified. To enhance the yield of NK, effect of various parameters such as pH, temperature, carbon source, nitrogen source and inoculum size were optimized. Strain improvement of P. aeruginosa CMSS was done by random UV-mutagenesis. Nattokinase was partially purified and the activity was determined by the casein digestion method, blood clot lysis and fibrin degradation assay. RESULTS: Based on morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization, the strain was confirmed as P. aeruginosa (GenBank accession number: JX112657), designated as P. aeruginosa CMSS. The optimum condition at pH 7 and temperature at 25˚C showed activity of NK as 1514 U mL(-1) and 1532 U mL(-1), respectively. Sucrose as the carbon source and shrimp shell powder (SSP) as the nitrogen source expressed NK activity of 1721 U mL(-1) and 2524 U mL(-1), respectively. At 1% inoculum size, the maximum rate of enzyme production was achieved with 2581 U mL(-1). The NK activity of the mutant strain UV60 was 4263 U mL(-1), indicating a two-fold increase in activity compared to the wild strain (2581 UmL(-1)). Nattokinase produced from mutant strain P. aeruginosa CMSS UV60 showed 94% blood clot lysis at ten minutes. The degradation of fibrin clot by the produced NK was observed after two hours of incubation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) confirmed the molecular mass of CMSS UV60 NK to be 21kDa. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated the enhanced production of NK by P. aeruginosa CMSS. This study is unique and the findings are the first report on the production of NK from P. aeruginosa CMSS isolated from cow milk."

      "abstract": "Nattokinase (NK) is a serine protease extracted from a traditional Japanese food called natto. Due to its strong fibrinolytic and thrombolytic activity, NK is regarded as a valuable dietary supplement or nutraceutical for the oral thrombolytic therapy. In addition, NK has been investigated for some other medical applications including treatment of hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and vitreoretinal disorders. The most widely used clinical anticoagulants are heparin and low molecular weight heparins. The interactions between heparin and proteins modulate diverse patho-physiological processes and heparin modifies the activity of serine proteases. Indeed, heparin plays important roles in almost all of NK's potential therapeutically applications. The current report relies on surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to examine NK interacting with heparin as well as other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These studies showed that NK is a heparin binding protein with an affinity of ~250 nM. Examination with differently sized heparin oligosaccharides indicated that the interaction between NK and heparin is chain-length dependent and the minimum size for heparin binding is a hexasaccharide. Studies using chemically modified heparin showed the 6-O-sulfo as well as the N-sulfo groups but not the 2-O-sulfo groups within heparin, are essential for heparin's interaction with NK. Other GAGs (including HS, DS, and CSE) displayed modest binding affinity to NK. NK also interfered with other heparin-protein interactions, including heparin's interaction with antithrombin and fibroblast growth factors.",

A double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over NK intervention study was carried out in 12 healthy young males. Following the baseline blood draw, each subject was randomized to receive either a single-dose of 2,000 FU NK (NSK-SD, Japan Bio Science Laboratory Co., Ltd) or placebo with subsequent cross-over of the groups. Subjects donated blood samples at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours following administration for analysis of coagulation/fibrinolysis parameters. As a result, D-dimer concentrations at 6, and 8 hours, and blood fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products at 4 hours after NK administration elevated significantly (p < 0.05, respectively). Factor VIII activity declined at 4 and 6 hours (p < 0.05, respectively), blood antithrombin concentration was higher at 2 and 4 hours (p < 0.05, respectively), and the activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged significantly at 2 and 4 hours following NK administration (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). All the changes, however, were within the normal range. In conclusion, thus, a single-dose of NK administration appears enhancing fibrinolysis and anti-coagulation via several different pathways simultaneously.",

In this study, high-level expression of nattokinase was achieved in Bacillus licheniformis WX-02 via host strain construction and signal peptides optimization. First, ten genes (mpr, vpr, aprX, epr, bpr, wprA, aprE, bprA, hag, amyl) encoding for eight extracellular proteases, a flagellin and an amylase were deleted to obtain B. licheniformis BL10, which showed no extracellular proteases activity in gelatin zymography. Second, the gene fragments of P43 promoter, Svpr, nattokinase and TamyL were combined into pHY300PLK to form the expression vector pP43SNT. In BL10 (pP43SNT), the fermentation activity and product activity per unit of biomass of nattokinase reached 14.33 FU/mL and 2,187.71 FU/g respectively, which increased by 39 and 156 % compared to WX-02 (pP43SNT). Last, Svpr was replaced with SsacC and SbprA, and the maximum fermentation activity (33.83 FU/mL) was achieved using SsacC, which was 229 % higher than that of WX-02 (pP43SNT). The maximum NK fermentation activity in this study reaches the commercial production level of solid state fermentation, and this study provides a promising engineered strain for industrial production of nattokinase, as well as a potential platform host for expression of other target proteins.",

After being weaned, 7-week-old male SHR and 7-week-old male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were randomized into seven groups. Until the 8th week of life, the rats in each group were given one of the following: Group 1, high dose of GABA and nattokinase in the SHR (SHD); Group 2, medium dose of GABA and nattokinase in the SHR (SMD); Group 3, low dose of GABA and nattokinase in the SHR (SLD); Group 4, negative control in the SHR (SD); Group 5, positive control in the SHR (SM); Group 6, high dose of GABA and nattokinase in the WKY (WHD); and Group 7, negative control in the WKY (WD). Distilled water served as the negative control, and captopril (50 mg/kg), a known ACE inhibitor, served as the positive control. Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure values were measured weekly from the 8th week to the 16th week of life using the tail-cuff method. A definite decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure values could be observed in the rats treated with captopril and in the rats that received GABA and nattokinase. The greatest antihypertensive effect was observed when the pharmacological treatment was administered. The effect of the daily intake of fermented beans containing GABA and nattokinase may be helpful in controlling blood pressure levels in hypertensive model animals. The fermentation of beans with B. subtilis B060 may therefore constitute a successful strategy for producing a functional food with antihypertensive activity."

In this study, we hypothesized that SP and NK could modulate certain factors that are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology in the experimental model. Oral administration of aluminium chloride (AlCl3) in a dose of 17 mg/kg body weight (bw) daily for 45 days induced AD-like pathology in male rats with a significant increase in brain acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Fas and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Meanwhile, AlCl3 supplementation produced significant decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) when compared with control values. Also, AlCl3 administration caused significant decline in the expression levels of disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 9 (ADAM9) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 10 (ADAM10) genes in the brain. Histological investigation of brain tissue of rat model of AD showed neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus and focal hyalinosis with cellular as well as a cellular amyloid plaques formation. Oral administration of SP or NK in a rat model of AD daily for 45 days resulted in a significant decrease in brain AchE activity, TGF-β, Fas and IL-6 levels. Also, the treatment with these enzymes produced significant increase in BDNF and IGF-1 levels when compared with the untreated AD-induced rats. Moreover, both SP and NK could markedly increase the expression levels of ADAM9 and ADAM10 genes in the brain tissue of the treated rats. These findings were well confirmed by the histological examination of the brain tissue of the treated rats. The present results support our hypothesis that the oral administration of proteolytitc enzymes, SP and/or NK, would have an effective role in modulating certain factors characterizing AD. Thus, these enzymes may have a therapeutic application in the treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Nattokinase is a serine protease and is derived from natto, a traditional Japanese, fermented, soybean food meal. Multiple authors have described the significant fibrinolytic, antithrombotic, and antihypertensive effects of natto. Nattokinase has been growing in popularity for use as a dietary supplement for the benefit of cardiovascular health. Little is known regarding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of this enzyme, and the bioavailability of nattokinase is currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study intended to (1) detect nattokinase directly and immunologically, (2) show that nattokinase and/or its metabolites were detectable in human blood following ingestion of a commercial preparation, and (3) chart a pharmacokinetic dosing effect for nattokinase. DESIGN: The research team designed the pilot study as an in vivo, human clinical trial. Healthy human subjects responded to an advertisement and were screened. Subjects who satisfied both inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. Subjects were then instructed to orally ingest a single capsule containing a known concentration of nattokinase immediately following a baseline blood draw. Subsequent blood draws occurred over a 24-h period. SETTING: This study was conducted in Oakland, California, at a clinical reference laboratory and was performed with the approval of an institutional review board (IRB) to ensure that appropriate ethical standards were met. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven healthy participants (five male, six female, ages 21-65), who met eligibility criteria, were enrolled. INTERVENTION(S): Administration of nattokinase occurred orally with the ingestion of a single daily dose (2000 FU) of nattokinase. Capsules, each containing approximately 100 mg of nattokinase, in softgel form (NSK-SD, Japan Bio Science Laboratory, Osaka, Japan), were used in the study. OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Baseline blood samples were collected, and participants were observed swallowing a single capsule of the nattokinase supplement before returning at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h post ingestion for subsequent blood draws. The presence of nattokinase in serum was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a rabbit, polyclonal, antinattokinase-capture antibody. A pharmacokinetic pattern was observed for nattokinase between baseline and 48 h postdose. RESULTS: Peak serum levels of nattokinase were observed at approximately 13.3 h ± 2.5 h (mean ± standard error) postdose. Statistically significant increases in binding were detectable from baseline when comparing averaged data at time points t = 2 h-t = 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: These results provided the first evidence that nattokinase can be measured directly in the blood of humans. The results further suggest that a larger, more extensive, pharmacokinetic study of nattokinase is warranted. Additionally, looking for intact enzyme and bioactive nattokinase peptides should be a consideration for future studies investigating the pharmacokinetic profile of nattokinase.",

Subtilisin NAT (nattokinase) produced by B. subtilis also inhibited ACE, and the inhibition was markedly stimulated by heat treatment of subtilisin at 120 °C for 15 min. Inhibition of ACE by subtilisin was of a mixed type: the decrease in V(max) and the increase in K(m) value. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that heat treatment of subtilisin caused inactivation with fragmentation of the enzyme protein into small peptides. The inhibitory action of subtilisin was not due to an enzymatic action of protease, but may be ascribed to the potent ACE-inhibitory peptides such as LY and FY, amino acid sequences in subtilisin. HPLC-MS analysis of heat-inactivated subtilisin confirmed that LY and FY were liberated by fragmentation of the enzyme. Inhibition of ACE by subtilisin and its degradation peptides such as LY and FY may participate in the suppression of blood pressure by ingestion of natto.",

      "abstract": "To determine whether the antihypertensive effect of nattokinase is associated with the protease activity of this enzyme, we compared nattokinase with the fragments derived from nattokinase, which possessed no protease activity, in terms of the effect on hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In the continuous oral administration test, the groups were given a basic diet alone (control), the basic diet containing nattokinase (0.2, 2.6 mg/g diet) or the basic diet containing the fragments derived from nattokinase (0.2, 0.6 mg/g diet). The group fed the basic diet containing high-dosage nattokinase (2.6 mg/g diet) showed significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and plasma fibrinogen level, compared with control group and no influence on activities of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1), and plasma angiotensin II level in the renin-angiotensin system. The treatment of the basic diet containing high-dosage fragments (0.6 mg/g diet) significantly decreased SBP, DBP and plasma angiotensin II level in plasma but the treatment did not influence on plasma fibrinogen level. These results suggest that nattokinase and its fragments are different from each other in the mechanism to reduce hypertension. Nattokinase, retained its protease activity after absorbance across the intestines, may decrease blood pressure through cleavage of fibrinogen in plasma. The fragments, which absorbed as nattokinase-degradation products, prevents the elevation of plasma angiotensin II level to suppress hypertension.",

In the current report, DNA family shuffling was used to improve the fibrinolytic activity of nattokinase. Three homologous genes from B. natto AS 1.107, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CICC 20164 and Bacillus licheniformis CICC 10092 were shuffled to generate a mutant library. A plate-based method was used to screen the mutant libraries for improved activity. After three rounds of DNA shuffling, one desirable mutant with 16 amino acid substitutions was obtained. The mutant enzyme was purified and characterized. The kinetic measurements showed that the catalytic efficiency of the mutant NK was approximately 2.3 times higher than that of the wild-type nattokinase. In addition, the molecular modeling analysis suggested that the mutations affect the enzymatic function by changing the surface conformation of the substrate-binding pocket. The current study shows that the evolution of nattokinase with improved fibrinolytic activity by DNA family shuffling is feasible and provides useful references to facilitate the application of nattokinase in thrombolytic therapy.",

Although there is debate on whether the toxicity is due to amyloids or their precursors, research on the degradation of amyloids may help prevent or alleviate these diseases. In this study, we explored the amyloid-degrading ability of nattokinase, a fibrinolytic subtilisin-like serine protease, and determined the optimal conditions for amyloid hydrolysis.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 86 participants ranging from 20 to 80 years of age with an initial untreated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130 to 159 mmHg received nattokinase (2,000 FU/capsule) or a placebo capsule for 8 weeks. Seventy-three subjects completed the protocol. Compared with the control group, the net changes in SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were -5.55 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI], -10.5 to -0.57 mmHg; p<0.05) and -2.84 mmHg (CI, -5.33 to -0.33 mmHg; p<0.05), respectively, after the 8-week intervention. The corresponding net change in renin activity was -1.17 ng/mL/h for the nattokinase group compared with the control group (p<0.05). In conclusion, nattokinase supplementation resulted in a reduction in SBP and DBP. These findings suggest that increased intake of nattokinase may play an important role in preventing and treating hypertension.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of intravitreal injection of nattokinase (subtilisin NAT), a serine protease that is produced by Bacillus subtilis (natto), for induction of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). METHODS: Different doses of nattokinase (1, 0.1, or 0.01 fibrin-degradation units [FU]) or physiologic saline as a control were injected into the vitreous cavity of rabbit eyes. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the retinal surfaces of four rabbit eyes per concentration. Histologic alterations were assessed by light microscopy, using four eyes from each group. Electroretinography (ERG) was performed to observe retinal function, ranging from 1 hour to 1 week after the nattokinase (1 or 0.1 FU) or saline solution administration, using four eyes from each group at each time point. Also, findings in all rabbits were monitored by slit lamp examination and by indirect ophthalmoscopy with a 20-D lens. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy showed smooth retinal surfaces, indicating the occurrence of PVD at 30 minutes after intervention in all the experimental eyes injected with 0.1 or 1.0 FU nattokinase, but none of the control eyes. Light microscopy and ERG analysis showed no critical change even after the use of 0.1 FU nattokinase, an amount sufficient to induce PVD. However, toxicity in the forms of preretinal hemorrhage and ERG changes was noted with the higher dose (1 FU) of nattokinase. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that nattokinase is a useful enzyme for pharmacologic vitreolysis because of its efficacy in inducing PVD.",

The optimal temperature for forward and backward extraction were 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C respectively. Nattokinase became more thermosensitive during reverse micelles extraction. And it could be enriched in the stripping phase eight times during backward extraction. It was found that nattokinase could be purified by AOT reverse micelles with up to 80% activity recovery and with a purification factor of 3.9.",

NK capsules were also administered orally to dogs with experimentally induced thrombosis, and lysis of the thrombi was observed by angiography. The results obtained suggest that NK represents a possible drug for use not only in the treatment of embolism but also in the prevention of the disease, since NK has a proven safety and can be massproduced.",
