      "abstract": "BackgroundHealthy dietary patterns have been linked to reduced risks for cardiovascular diseases and dementia, making nutrition an essential part of a comprehensive approach for dementia prevention. Knowledge about factors associated with a healthy diet in people with increased dementia risk is scarce.ObjectiveTo analyze dietary habits and associated factors in older adults with increased dementia risk in Germany.MethodsWe used baseline-data of the AgeWell.de-trial (n = 1001, %female = 52.2, Mage = 69.0, SD = 4.9). Nutrition was assessed using a composite score, comprising 11 components covered by national recommendations for a healthy diet (range = 0-11 points). Linear regressions assessed associations of sociodemographic, social, health-related and psychological factors with consumption of a healthy diet. Further, we assessed stages of change based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change.ResultsConsumption of a healthy diet was moderate (Median = 4, IQR = 2). Female sex (b = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.88), higher levels of motivation for healthy eating (b = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.34) and higher self-efficacy (b = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.46) were linked to a healthy diet. Regarding the stages of behavior change, the majority were in the maintenance stage (45.2%), followed by the contemplation (21.5%) and precontemplation (21.2%) stages.ConclusionsResults suggest room for improvement regarding a healthy diet in our sample. Lifestyle-based interventions in older adults should be tailored towards current levels of motivation and self-efficacy of participants. Including modules targeting motivation and self-efficacy might help maximize intervention effectiveness."

      "abstract": "The magnitude of the problem of stunting is high in low- to middle-income countries, including Indonesia. The government of Indonesia has implemented specific and sensitive intervention programs to reduce this problem. This public health problem requires multidisciplinary management with suitable approaches and programs. In the first 1000 days of life, the quality of life is determined by conception and delivery until two years old. The requirement and fulfillment of nutrients during this period would benefit the growth and development of children. Indonesia is an archipelago country with 100,000 km of coastline and 16,771 islands with great potential for fishing. In coastal areas, optimizing protein consumption from the sea and enhancing educational programs in psychosocial care are appropriate intervention programs that will benefit stunting eradication. The complexity of the stunting problem puts authorities and other stakeholders together to formulate and design appropriate comprehensive intervention programs to improve the quality of life of the next generation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An Elimination Diet (ED) or Healthy Diet (HD) may be effective in reducing symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but long-term maintenance effects and feasibility have never been examined. METHODS: One-year prospective follow-up of a sample of 165 children (5-12 years) with ADHD randomized (unblinded; 1:1) to 5 weeks treatment with either ED (N = 84) or HD (N = 81) and a non-randomized comparator arm including 58 children being treated with Care as Usual (CAU). Dietary participants were allowed to add or switch to CAU treatment after 5 weeks. The primary outcome was a 5-point ordinal measure of improvement based on both parent and teacher ratings on ADHD and dysregulation problems, determined after 1 year prospective follow-up. Ordinal regression analyses and linear mixed models analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis. In addition, as-treated analyses were performed. The trial is closed and registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NL5324. RESULTS: At 1 year follow-up, 24% of the participants still complied with the ED and 37% still complied with the HD. In the ED (+CAU) trajectory, fewer participants showed (partial) improvement after 1-year prospective follow-up compared to the HD (+CAU) trajectory (47% vs. 64%, χ2 (4, N = 152) = 11.97, p = 0.018). The HD (+CAU) - but not ED (+CAU) - trajectory had comparable 1-year outcomes compared to the non-randomized CAU-trajectory. Results for secondary outcomes (e.g. health, parental stress) did not differ between the ED (+CAU) and HD (+CAU) trajectories. The prevalence of psychostimulant use was lower in the ED (+CAU) and HD (+CAU) trajectories compared to the non-randomized CAU-trajectory (38%, 45%, 78%, respectively). Predictors for long-term benefit from dietary treatments included high initial severity of ADHD problems, low severity of emotional problems and sufficient parental mental resources. CONCLUSIONS: In line with the short-term effects, prospective 1-year follow-up outcomes are in favor of treatment with HD and not ED. Initial 5-week treatment with HD and if needed/preferred followed by CAU may reduce psychostimulant use without negatively impacting 1-year outcomes."

Despite this, current eating habits diverge significantly from established dietary recommendations, namely the MD among young university students. The eating habits of young people are characterised by a high consumption of energy-dense foods and a low consumption of vegetables and fruit. Thus, university canteen food services are essential in promoting a healthy and sustainable diet. This systematic review aimed to identify the strategies for promoting adherence to the MD and healthy diets in Higher Education food service. This systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Of the 39 studies that were retrieved, all focused on strategies to improve healthy eating, and none specifically used the term \"Mediterranean\". Studies were conducted in different countries worldwide. Architectural nudges, discounts on healthy food and nutritional information were identified as successful strategies, especially among females and students with higher nutrition education. A combination of nudging strategies in food service is a promising way to promote healthier food habits.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: A healthy diet plays an important role for chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment, but adherence to nutritional recommendations is frequently low. The aim of the present study was to describe barriers and facilitators to adherence to a healthy diet in people with CKD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study; 80 predialysis (n=20), hemodialysis (n=20), peritoneal dialysis (n=20) and transplant (n=20) patients matched by age and sex, were included. Nutritional evaluation included subjective global assessment, anthropometry, quality of food consumption (Mini-ECCA v.2), self-perception about diet and willingness to change. Barriers and facilitators were evaluated with a qualitative approach (semi-structured interviews). Concepts were converted into \"in vivo\" and \"theoretical\" codes, then, grouped into categories. A second analysis was performed with the ATLAS.ti software. RESULTS: Frequency of malnutrition was 50% in people receiving dialysis. Quality of food consumption was healthier on people with CKD stages 3b-5 (40%) and people with kidney transplant (65%) compared to peritoneal dialysis (25%) and hemodialysis (0%). The main themes influencing adherence to a healthy diet were: need for nutritional guidance, economy, dietary restrictions, willingness to change, relationship with consequences in disease control and health status, aversion for healthy foods, bad and good self-perception, family support, feelings and emotions, environment, eating habits and CKD itself. Lack of time, work, economy, food preferences and cravings were the main barriers in people with CKD stage 3b-5 and transplant, while low willingness to eat healthy foods and dietary restrictions were the main barriers in people receiving dialysis. CONCLUSION: Personal, environmental, health professional-related, CKD related as well as feelings and emotions aspects that people with CKD face in a daily basis, act as barriers or facilitators when trying to follow a healthy diet. Individualizing nutritional treatment taking into account people with CKD perspectives and situations is of utmost importance to improve adherence to nutritional treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) prevalence is rising worldwide, but optimal dietary strategies remain unclear. The eMOM pilot RCT compared a plant-protein rich Healthy Nordic Diet (HND) and a moderately carbohydrate restricted diet (MCRD) and their potential effects on time in glucose target range (≤ 7.8 mmol/L, %TIR), and on newborn body composition. METHODS: Forty-two participants were randomized to either HND (n = 20) or MCRD (n = 22) face-to-face nutritional counseling from gestational weeks (GW) 24 + 0-28 + 6 (baseline) until delivery. The HND intervention had no restriction in carbohydrate intake and emphasized plant-based protein sources and Nordic food, while the MCRD had a moderate carbohydrate restriction (~ 40% in proportion to total daily energy consumption, E%). Continuous glucose monitoring was worn for 14 days to assess glucose levels and %TIR. Blood samples for glucose and lipid metabolism and 3-day food diaries were collected at baseline and at GW 34 + 0-35 + 6. Neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography. Difference between groups were analysed with t-test and Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: Thirty-two women completed the study. Both groups maintained the %TIR during majority of the time (98.9 and 99.3% for MCRD and HND respectively, p = 0.921) in GW 34 + 0 - 35 + 6. The mean glucose was lower in the MCRD group compared to the HND group (5.0 SD 1.03 vs. 5.2 SD 0.96 mmol/l, p < 0.001). No differences were observed in glucose variability, lipid metabolism, gestational weight gain, or in the body composition of the newborns. HND had lower diet macronutrient adherence than the MCRD, resulting in similar macronutrient composition in both groups. The mean macronutrient intakes were fat: 40.6 vs. 39.5 E%, carbohydrate: 40.5 vs. 42.4 E%, protein: 18.9 vs. 18.1 E% for the MCRD and HND groups, respectively. The HND decreased intake of meat and increased fish consumption significantly compared to the MCRD. CONCLUSIONS: Both a moderately restricted carbohydrate diet and a diet focused on plant-based protein effectively maintained a large time within the treatment target range in women with GDM. Further research could explore the impact of protein quantity and sources in maternal diets on glycemic control and newborn outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The eMOM pilot trial is registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (21/09/2018, NCT03681054)."

      "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic disease correlated with numerous risk factors that not only negatively affect all body functions but also increase the chances of developing chronic diseases and the associated morbidity and mortality rates. This study proposes a novel system that bridges the gap between healthcare providers and patients by offering both parties some tools for navigating the intricacies of dietary planning. In this system, machine learning techniques are used to determine the required calories before starting an obesity treatment. A hybrid precision model with minimal parameters is also developed to estimate the appropriate number of calories for losing weight and to formulate a healthy diet plan. A real dataset of 15 anthropometric measurements is analyzed using SVR, LR, and DTR regression models, and all the data are preprocessed before analysis to enhance model performance. Results show that the required calories can be estimated with a high correlation (R = 0.985) from independent measurements. The proposed model also calculates the healthy daily percentages of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates based on a knowledge base of medical rules and functions, thus facilitating the sequential treatment of obese patients. In sum, this study applies different models to design a practical, cost-effective approach for accurately determining the required calories and formulating valuable diet plans for obesity treatment and management.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) disproportionately impacts Black Americans, who are three times more likely to develop AD. While heart-healthy diets have shown potential in reducing AD risk, research on adapted dietary interventions for Black American communities remains limited. This pilot study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted brain healthy diet intervention (MIND + SOUL) and explored changes in cardiometabolic risk and cognition. Twenty-nine participants completed the 12-week intervention, which included culturally tailored health education, cooking classes, health coaching, and groceries. Feasibility was assessed by attendance and retention rates, while acceptability was measured by two questionnaires. Participants had a mean age of 70.3, with 10.3% male. The intervention demonstrated high feasibility (89.3% retention) and acceptability (mean = 71.9, SD = 8.59), with meaningful improvements in body mass index (estimate = -0.54, P = 0.009), dietary intake (estimate = 28.39, P = 0.042), and executive function (estimate = 3.32, P < 0.001). However, no significant changes in blood-based biomarkers were observed. The MIND + SOUL intervention demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability, improvements in body composition, cognitive function, and dietary behaviors, despite no significant changes in blood-based biomarkers. Findings suggest potential benefits for reducing AD risk factors and promoting healthy aging. Clinical Trials Registry: ClinicalTrials.Gov; NCT05414682."

The aim of this systematic review is to examine the nature and findings of eSBIs targeting diet and/or physical activity (PA) among adult patients in healthcare settings since smartphone technologies emerged. METHODS: Three systematic searches in PubMed, ScienceDirect and PsycINFO were conducted from January 2010 to May 2023. We include all studies assessing eSBI towards lifestyle habits (dietary habits and/or PA at least), implemented in healthcare settings and targeting adult participants. RESULTS: Of 1981 articles identified, 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Most of them documented eSBIs implemented in primary care (n = 11), targeting PA (n = 11) and diet (n = 9) alone or combined (n = 5). Some eSBIs targeted additional behaviors (e.g. smoking, drinking). Delivery modes included computer (n = 8), printed documents (n = 8) or phone (n = 2) but only four eSBIs were interactive (or partially automated). In addition to personalized feedback, most common behavior change techniques were \"information about social and environmental consequences\" (n = 9), \"goal setting\" (n = 7), and \"information about health consequences\" (n = 7). Most studies assessing behavior change had a control group (8 in 10), and eight studies found positive changes in behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Although implementing eSBIs towards PA/diet among adult patients in medical settings seems promising for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention, common conceptual framework, intervention and outcomes are severely lacking, and the extent to which they follow existing SBI guidelines remains unclear. Demonstrating their effectiveness requires fixing these issues before conducting prospective assessment studies in medical settings.",

However, evidence regarding their combined effects in older adults is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a combined 12-week Mediterranean diet-based sustainable healthy diet (SHD) and multicomponent training (MT) intervention on body composition, anthropometry, and physical fitness in older adults. METHODS: Diet intervention groups received a weekly SHD food supply and four sessions, including a SHD culinary practical workshop. The exercise program included MT 50 min group session, three times a week, on non-consecutive days. Body composition and physical fitness variables were assessed through dual X-ray absorptiometry, anthropometric measurements, and senior fitness tests. Repeated measures ANOVA, with terms for group, time, and interaction, was performed. RESULTS: Our results showed that a combined intervention significantly lowered BMI and total fat. Also, significant differences between assessments in all physical fitness tests, except for aerobic endurance, were observed. Adjusted models show significant differences in BMI (p = 0.049) and WHR (p = 0.037) between groups and in total fat (p = 0.030) for the interaction term. Body strength (p < 0.001), balance tests (p < 0.001), and aerobic endurance (p = 0.005) had significant differences amongst groups. Considering the interaction term, differences were observed for upper body strength (p = 0.046) and flexibility tests (p = 0.004 sit and reach, p = 0.048 back scratch).

The Sustainable HEalthy Diet index was developed to measure the nutritional, environmental, and sociocultural components of sustainable diets and healthy eating patterns. However, a methodological approach has yet to be proposed for Turkish adults. This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of the SHED index in Turkish adults. METHODS: Data were collected from 558 healthy adults using a web-based questionnaire. Internal consistency reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and repeatability was evaluated using the test-retest method. Construct validity was investigated using the EAT-Lancet diet and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), and the adapted SHED index structures' accordance was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: Good reliability and repeatability were found (r = 0.758 and 0.795, respectively). A higher SHED index score was related to a greater intake of grains, fruits, and vegetables and a lower intake of meat, eggs, and dairy compared to EAT-Lancet diet food groups. A higher SHED index score was associated with a lower saturated fat and added sugar intake. While the SHED index was associated with greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (r = 0.334, p < 0.001), it was negatively associated with non-alcoholic and diet non-alcoholic beverage consumption (r = -0.257 and -0.264, respectively; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The SHED index showed good validity and reliability in Turkish adults. Our results suggest that the SHED index can be used in epidemiological and intervention studies because it allows the measurement of diets in terms of health and sustainability to propose adaptations accordingly.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: To examine associations between weight self-stigma and healthy diet or physical activity, and potential moderating effects of self-esteem, diabetes self-efficacy, and diabetes social support, among adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Diabetes MILES-2 data were used, an Australian cross-sectional online survey. Participants with type 2 diabetes who considered themselves overweight, and reported concern about weight management (N = 726; 48% insulin-treated), completed the Weight Self-Stigma Questionnaire (WSSQ; total score and subscales: self-devaluation, fear of enacted stigma), measures of diabetes self-care (diet, exercise), and hypothesised psychosocial moderators (self-esteem, diabetes self-efficacy, and diabetes social support). Adjusted linear regression tested associations and interaction effects, separately by insulin treatment status. RESULTS: Greater weight self-stigma (WSSQ total) was associated with less optimal dietary self-care (both groups: β = -0.3), and with a lower level of exercise (non-insulin only: β = -0.2; all p < 0.001). All hypothesised moderators were negatively associated with weight self-stigma (range r = -0.2 to r = -0.5). Positive associations were identified between the hypothesised moderators and self-care behaviours (strongest between diet and diabetes self-efficacy, r = > 0.5). No significant interaction effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence of negative associations between weight self-stigma and self-care behaviours among adults with type 2 diabetes. Weight self-stigma is a demonstrated barrier to self-care behaviours in type 2 diabetes cohorts. Acknowledgement and strategies to address weight self-stigma are needed in clinical care and health programmes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders still rank as leading causes of morbidity worldwide despite increasing awareness and improvements in treatment. Notably, low- and middle-income countries like Uganda, are disproportionately affected by such disorders. The burden of depressive symptoms in these countries is particularly high among students, aggravated by poverty, malnutrition, and inadequate public health governance, yet it is clearly under-researched, making it hard to achieve several of UN Sustainability Development Goals. Current treatment options are insufficient to tackle the increased burden of depressive disease. This is more challenging for low-resource regions especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting the need for alternative treatments that can swiftly be applied if proven effective. The main aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is therefore to examine if a low-cost healthy diet (based on local Ugandan foods) combined with easy-to access mindfulness cognitive therapy can reduce depressive symptoms among university students in Uganda. METHODS: We will recruit female and male students at Makerere University, the largest public university in Uganda, to an open, intention-to-treat, two-armed RCT. Those who score above a predefined threshold on a self-reported assessment of depressive symptoms, measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression score (CES-D), are eligible for study inclusion and will be randomized to either an intervention (n = 125) or a control (n = 125) group. The intervention group will receive educational group-based sessions on how to prepare a Mediterranean-type of healthy diet and how to adhere to the principles of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Outcome measures include self-reported depression symptoms, quality of life, and dietary intakes. In addition we will perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. The RCT intervention will last 9 months, followed by additional 15 months with regular data collections. DISCUSSION: We here describe a novel approach to treat depressive symptoms among university students living in resource constraint settings, by combining a healthy diet with low threshold psychotherapy. If this intervention succeeds, our project can be viewed as a step towards evidence-based behavior practices for young adults with a common mental disorder (depression) that are beneficial to public mental health initiatives and management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The RCT is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05848973). The date of registration was August 14, 2023.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The risk of MetS can be transmitted via epigenetic processes from both the mother and the father. Therefore, it is essential that both members of a couple are targeted in pre-conception nutrition and physical activity-based lifestyle programs. However, lifestyle interventions targeting both members of a couple are scarce in the literature. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators of a couples-based lifestyle intervention. METHODS: Nulliparous couples who had an interest in having children in the future were recruited to the study and each member interviewed separately to gain insight into to gain insight into designing future couples-based lifestyle interventions. Interviews were conducted between June and October 2021. Reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) was applied to conduct and analyse semi-structured, in-depth interviews with nulliparous couples who had an interest in having children in the future. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified in nine couples aged 25-34 years (here referred to as \"millennials\"): Millennials are committed to preparation for their future offspring; millennials know features of a good program likely to have high adherence and long-term behavior change; millennials acknowledge the importance of couples-based programs; and millennials appreciate that future global emergencies may require lifestyle modifications. CONCLUSION: This study found that millennial couples showed a strong intention to create optimal emotional, financial, and health conditions for their children. They supported couples-based approach (CBA) lifestyle interventions to mitigate potential epigenetic risks. Couples believed that participating together in these programs would enhance adherence to healthy habits, promoting long-term well-being. The findings advocate for exploring and testing CBA interventions that target both partners, as joint participation not only aids in healthy conception and reduces metabolic syndrome risks but also establishes a foundation for family health. These insights highlight the potential of CBA interventions to positively impact future generations."

There are educational pamphlets or booklets to improve patients' knowledge about healthy diets. As video presentation is more desirable than the presentation of readable materials, we designed an educational video on healthy diets in renal failure patients who was played during several sessions of hemodialysis. We compared the effect of this modality on the knowledge, attitudes and metabolic control of the patients before and after the intervention. METHODS: In this interventional study, all the patients who were referred to the hemodialysis ward at Ashrafi-Esfahani Medical Center (Tehran, Iran) between May 2018 and March 2019 were enrolled (N = 190). Totally, 130 patients had inclusion criteria. An educational video about a healthy diet was shown seven times (once a week in the first month, once every two weeks in the second month, and once in the third month) during hemodialysis for the patients. The nephrologist prepared a video in the form of a lecture with graphic images for 20 min based on the healthy nutrition of the Kidney Federation of Iran's Guide for hemodialysis patients. The questionnaire was completed in terms of awareness and attitudes, and blood and urine tests were performed at the 1st, 3rd, and 12th months. Serum parameters, including electrolytes, lipid profile, CBC-diff, dialysis efficacy (Kt/V), and the URR (urine filtration rate) were examined. Pre and post intervention values were compared via the statistical analysis performed using IBM SPSS. P-Value < 0.05 was significant. RESULTS: The data of 128 people were analyzed at the end of the study. 55% of patients were 10-40 years old and 60% were male. 56% of patients were illiterate or had an elementary school education. The most common underlying diseases were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Ten to 19% of participants had enough knowledge about the various components of a healthy diet for patients on hemodialysis. Approximately 25%, 14%, and 45% of the participants consumed a healthy diet for breakfast, lunch and dinner, respectively. A comparison of the mean values of the serum parameters before and after the intervention revealed significant changes in phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, and hemoglobin with mean differences of -118.41 ± 22.84, 21.51 ± 10.38 (both P < 0.001), and 0.29 ± 1.18 (P = 0.044), respectively. The mean Kt/V was similar at all phases. CONCLUSION: The use of an educational video was effective for normalizing the metabolic parameters in patients under hemodialysis and can be an appropriate option, especially for illiterate patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Healthy dietary patterns and exercise practices have been associated with improved metabolic and inflammatory profiles. However, studies regarding the combined effect of these interventions on plasma biomarkers and metabolome in older adults are sparser. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a combined Mediterranean Diet-based Sustainable Healthy Diet (SHD) and Multicomponent Training (MT) intervention on the plasma biomarkers and metabolome and how dietary intake and exercise could modulate these effects. METHODS: SHD intervention included a weekly supply of Mediterranean Diet-based SHD food and four nutrition sessions involving a Mediterranean-Diet culinary workshop, and the exercise program included 50-min MT group sessions, held three times a week, lasting both 12 weeks. Plasma biomarkers were obtained through standard biochemical analysis. A proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolomics approach was used to study the metabolome in blood plasma. Repeated measures ANOVA were performed and adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: SHD + MT intervention significantly decreased HDL-C and calcium. SHD + MT showed some changes in common with the SHD and MT group, namely a significant decrease in citrate levels (p = 0.009 for SHD + MT; p = 0.037 for SHDT) and an increase in pyruvate (p < 0.001 for MT and SHD + MT). The SHD + MT group also revealed specific changes in the levels of some amino acids (decrease in alanine, glutamine and lysine: p = 0.026; p < 0.001; p = 0.038, respectively). Increases in formate (p = 0.025) and unsaturated lipids (p = 0.011) are consistent with changes in energy and lipoprotein metabolism. CONCLUSION: Our data show that a combined lifestyle intervention program, including a Mediterranean Diet-based SHD and MT, could modulate biomarker and metabolome and there seems to be a metabolic path associated to these interventions in older adults. Due to its wide-ranging relevance, it is pertinent to assess to what extent combined SHD and MT can contribute to better clinical profiles.",

The school-based Healthy School Start intervention aims to promote healthy dietary and activity habits in the home environment and prevent child obesity through parental support. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the third iteration of the programme on children's dietary and activity behaviours, and body composition through a cluster-randomised controlled trial. The trial included 17 schools (8 intervention) in disadvantaged areas in mid-Sweden with 353 families with 5- to 7-year-old children. The primary outcomes were intake of selected healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages measured using photography. Secondary outcomes were physical activity and sedentary time measured by accelerometry, and measured weight and height. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and post-intervention (8 months). Linear multi-level regression showed significant favourable effects of the intervention for intake of sweet beverages (b =  - 0.17, p = 0.04), intake of healthy foods (b = 0.11, p = 0.04), and more time in moderate to vigorous physical activity during weekdays (b = 5.68, p = 0.02). An unfavourable sub-group effect of the intervention was found for children from families with low education regarding sedentary time on weekends (b = 23.04, p = 0.05). The results align with the previous two trials of the programme, indicating that school-based parental support is a useful approach for health promotion in young children in disadvantaged areas.

Our past work revealed a more pronounced obesity-cancer link in certain ethnic groups, motivating us to develop a tailored dietary intervention called the Healthy Diet and Lifestyle 2 (HDLS2). The study protocol is described herein for this randomized six-month trial examining the effects of intermittent energy restriction (5:2 Diet) plus the Mediterranean dietary pattern (IER + MED) on visceral adipose tissue (VAT), liver fat, and metabolic biomarkers, compared to a standard MED with daily energy restriction (DER + MED), in a diverse participant group. Using MRI and DXA scans for body composition analysis, as well as metabolic profiling, this research aims to contribute to nutritional guidelines and strategies for visceral obesity reduction. The potential benefits of IER + MED, particularly regarding VAT reduction and metabolic health improvement, could be pivotal in mitigating the obesity epidemic and its metabolic sequelae. The ongoing study will provide essential insights into the efficacy of these energy restriction approaches across varied racial/ethnic backgrounds, addressing an urgent need in nutrition and metabolic health research.

While multicomponent interventions have been shown to be effective in changing the lifestyle behaviours of children, there is a limited understanding of the feasibility of such interventions in primary schools in Singapore. A multiphase mixed method study was conducted to develop and examine the feasibility of a theory-based multicomponent school-based intervention-Promoting hEatlthy Eating and Active Lifestyle (PEDAL). METHODS: Underpinned by Kincaid's ideation model, the PEDAL intervention was developed to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and decrease sedentary behaviours among children. This study consists of three phases. Phase 1 details the development of PEDAL, which consists of four components: (A) a series of interactive health education lessons, (B) actionable home activities to support habit formation, (C) parental/guardian engagement, and (D) optimising the school environment. In Phase 2, components A and B of PEDAL were implemented in two public, co-educational primary schools among Primary 5 students (aged 10-12 years) in Singapore. Data was collected quantitatively using questionnaires and qualitatively using focus group discussions (FGDs) with students and teachers. The feasibility dimensions of components A and B, including recruitment capability, data collection, social validity, and practicality were examined, and ideation on healthy eating and physical activity was explored. In Phase 3, the full PEDAL intervention was pilot-tested in two other public, co-education primary schools with the same target population, using a concurrent mixed method quasi-experimental study design. Feasibility dimensions and potential effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed. DISCUSSION: This study will provide insights into the feasibility of PEDAL and inform its refinement. Findings from the pilot test will guide the planning of a larger-scale definitive trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered with ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN16114046) on 16 October 2022."

Intakes and the cost of seafood, dairy products, fruits, soybeans and nuts, whole grains and mixed beans were higher for the CHH diet-SC than for the control diet (P < 0·001). Intakes of vitamin B1, vitamin B6, vitamin C, Mg and phosphorus were positively correlated with the cost (P < 0·05). CONCLUSIONS: The CHH diet-SC costs more than the conventional Sichuan diet, partly due to the high cost of specific food groups. Positive correlations between the intakes of vitamin B1, vitamin B6, vitamin C, Mg, phosphorus and the dietary cost could be a direction to adjust the composition within the food groups to reduce the cost of the CHH diet-SC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among the most urgent public health challenges, of the twenty-first century, is obesity. This can be attributed to its relationship with several non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as well as premature mortality. Being overweight or obese is a major concern not only in high-income countries, but also in low-income and middle-income countries, particularly in urban areas. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of obesity, among Middle Eastern-descent adolescents, studying in Arabic secondary schools, located in Malaysia. Intervention studies, directed at Middle Eastern adolescents in Malaysia, are limited. This paper, describes the protocol, for an integrated health education intervention process. Titled 'Healthy lifestyle', it is a primary prevention process, aimed at curbing obesity and disordered eating, among Middle Eastern secondary school adolescents, aged 13-14 years old, residing in Malaysia. METHODS AND ANTICIPATED RESULTS: A cluster randomized controlled study will be conducted, involving 250 Middle Eastern adolescents, in Arabic schools in Malaysia. The participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. While the intervention group participates in six weeks of fortnightly six sessions (45 minutes per session), the control group will carry on with their regular curriculums, and normal physical activity routines. The variables which will be evaluated include anthropometric measurements, knowledge, attitude, daily routines, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, food assessment, eating attitudes test-26, and a structured questionnaire based on the HBM. Data will be collected from the intervention and control groups at baseline, post-intervention, and two months following the intervention. Data analysis will be performed by way of the SPSS Statistics software version 26. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) will be used, to test the effect of the intervention program, with regards to the selected variables (outcomes), between and within-group at baseline, as well as six weeks and two months following intervention, after adjusting for clustering. Outcomes will be assessed at each time point, along with a derived average over all three-time points; thus, ensuring that both the cumulative and overall effects are determined. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will provide useful information for improving the knowledge, attitude, and practices of Middle Eastern adolescents, with regards to body weight status, physical activity level, nutrition status (BMI and dietary intake), and disordered eating. This will go a long way, towards ensuring their adherence to appropriate physical activities, and a healthy diet, to keep non-communicable diseases at bay.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization, an unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity constitute the primary global health risks. The purpose of this study was to as-certain the barriers to a healthy diet (HD) and physical activity (PA) as perceived by the Polish population in order to implement public health interventions. METHODS: A quantitative survey was conducted using the computer-assisted telephone interview technique on a randomly selected representative sample of 2000 Polish citizens aged 18-88 years. The research tool was a questionnaire consisting of two parts: sociodemographic characteristics and examining barriers to an HD (Cronbach's alpha = 0.899) and regular PA (Cronbach's alpha = 0.923). RESULTS: Women constituted more than half of the sample (53.4%), and most of the respondents lived in urban areas (60.5%), considered their financial situation as average (56.9%), and their health as satisfactory (42.3%). Barriers to an HD include the cost of healthy food (43%), lack of motivation (26.7%), and lack of time (25.4%). Barriers to taking up PA include competing priorities (29%), a lack of motivation to exercise (27.3%), feeling of constant fatigue, and lack of energy (24.4%). Limiting factors in the adoption of both an HD and PA are gender (women > men; HD p < 0.01; PA p < 0.001), financial situation (unsatisfactory; HD and PA p < 0.001), health condition (unsatisfactory; HD and PA p < 0.001), type of work (blue-collar workers; HD p < 0.001; PA p < 0.05), and employment status (people running household; HD and PA p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide important information about barriers to adopting healthy lifestyle principles. The practical implications of our work can be used by policymakers responsible for intervention strategies and programmes to increase the number of people adhering to recommendations for an HD and PA by removing barriers."

Low diet quality is usually caused by perceived barriers that stop people to do certain behavior. Perceived barriers can be overcome by implementing proper method such as conducting nutrition education. This study aimed to analyze the impact of nutrition education on perceived barrier to healthy diet among adults with and without covid-19 history in Padang, Indonesia. This study was a pre-experimental study using pre and post-design. This study was conducted on 70 adults with or without COVID-19 infection history, residing in Padang, Indonesia. The intervention was given in the form of nutrition education. Difference test was conducted to assess the impact of nutrition education on respondents' nutrition knowledge and perceived barriers. The majority of the respondents both with and without COVID-19 history (71.4 and 80%) had medium level of nutritional knowledge before the intervention. After the intervention, there was a significant (P<0.05) improvement on respondents' nutritional knowledge for both groups (100%). The result also showed 40% of the respondents with COVID-19 history had medium level of perceived barriers, while 28.6% respondents without COVID-19 history (65.7%) had medium level of perceived barriers before the intervention. A significant improvement (P<0.05) also showed on respondents' perceived barriers after the intervention. On both groups more 90% of the respondents only had low level of perceived barriers. The result shows that nutrition education has significant impact both on respondents' nutritional knowledge and perceived barriers."

Several studies have provided conflicting evidence concerning the role of dietary approaches in improving PMS symptoms. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the possible influence of a healthy diet and motivational strategies on PMS symptoms and health-related quality of life among Omani adolescents. This open-label, randomized, prospective controlled trial was conducted at two randomly selected secondary schools, in Al Seeb Willayah, in Muscat region. Adolescents with PMS symptoms, who were in grade 10 or 11, aged 16 years or above, had regular menstrual cycles, and were not known to have psychiatric disorder were included in this study. Participants in the intervention group received an individual face-to-face dietary consultation and motivational phone consultation. The health outcomes, including the PMS symptoms in both groups, and quality of life, were recorded using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems questionnaire (DRSP) and the 14-item Self-Reporting-Based Perceived Stress Scale tools, respectively. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean premenstrual symptom scores between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included the quality of life and stress levels of participants. The study period was from 1 February and ended 30 June 2021. SPSS was used to analyze the data, and intention-to-treat analysis was utilized. A total of 72 adolescents with PMS were randomized into intervention and control groups (n = 36 each). Both groups were similar at baseline (p-value > 0.05). No significant association was found between a healthy diet and PMS symptoms (p-value > 0.05). In addition, no significant association was found between a healthy diet and quality of life at follow-up (p-value = 0.216). The outcomes of this study refuted any possible relationships between a healthy diet and PMS symptoms. Accordingly, dietary consultations may not facilitate the clinical management of PMS symptoms in adolescent females.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Healthy diet is essential for cardiovascular disease risk management, but its effects among Chinese patients, whose diets differ from Western diets, remain largely unknown. METHODS: In this multicenter, patient- and outcome assessor-blind, randomized controlled feeding trial, 265 Chinese adults with baseline systolic blood pressure 130 to 159 mmHg were randomly assigned into Chinese heart-healthy (CHH) diet or usual diet for a 28-d intervention after a 7-d run-in period on usual diet. Blood lipids and glucose were measured from overnight fasting blood samples before and after the intervention. Ten-year cardiovascular disease risk was estimated using models previously developed and validated in Chinese. The changes in secondary outcomes of serum total cholesterol (TC), blood glucose, and 10-y cardiovascular disease risk over the intervention period were compared between intervention groups, adjusting for center, among participants with baseline and follow-up blood samples available. Sensitivity analyses were done with further adjustment for baseline values and covariables; missing data imputed; and among per-protocol population. RESULTS: Among 256 eligible participants (130 on CHH diet, 126 on control diet), 42% had hypercholesterolemia and 15% had diabetes at baseline. In the control group, TC and 10-y cardiovascular disease risk decreased after the intervention by 0.16 mmol/L and 0.91%, respectively, but blood glucose increased by 0.25 mmol/L. Compared with usual diet, the CHH diet lowered TC (-0.14 mmol/L, P = 0.017) and 10-y cardiovascular disease risk (-1.24%, P = 0.001) further. No effect on blood glucose was found. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results on TC and 10-y cardiovascular disease risk, and analysis with multiple variables adjusted showed a borderline significant effect on blood glucose (-0.17 mmol/L, P = 0.051). The differences in intake of nutrients and food groups between intervention groups explained the results. CONCLUSIONS: The CHH diet reduced TC and 10-y cardiovascular disease risk and was likely to reduce blood glucose among Chinese adults with mild hypertension. Further studies with longer terms are warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03882645.",

General CVD prediction model was used in manners of intention-to-treat and per-protocol set. After a 7-d run-in period, fifty-three participants with pre- and grade I hypertension from local communities were randomised and provided with either CHH diet-SC (n 27) or a control diet (n 26) for 4 weeks. Mean absolute and relative estimated CVD risks were reduced by 4·5 % and 27·9 % in the CHH diet-SC group, and the between-group relative risk reduction was 19·5 % (P < 0·001) using linear mixed-effects models. The sensitivity analysis with datasets and models showed consistent results, and pre-specified factors were not associated with the intervention effects. The vascular age of CHH-SC group was theoretically 4·4 years younger than that of the control group after intervention. Compared with a typical diet, adopting the CHH diet-SC over 1 month significantly reduced 10-year CVD risks and vascular ages among local adults with mild hypertension.",

We aimed at evaluating covariates of healthy diet and physical activity self-management among patients undergone bariatric surgery using Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, 272 patients with a history of bariatric surgery were selected from the data registry of Tehran Obesity Treatment Study (TOTS). Data were collected using bariatric surgery self-management standard questionnaire (BSSQ), and items based on HAPA model for healthy diet and physical activity self-management. Data were analyzed using Path analysis and AMOS version 24. RESULTS: The mean score of self-management was (32 ± 10SD). Coping planning construct (β = 0.22; p<0.001) and risk perception (β = 0.02; p<0.01) in dietary self-management and action planning (β = 0.16; p = 0.001) and risk perception (β = 0.001; p = 0.17) in physical activity self-management had the highest and lowest effect powers, respectively. Coping planning (β = 0.22; p<0.001) and action planning (β = 0.17; p<0.03) in diet, and action planning (β = 0.16; p = 0.010) in physical activity were significantly related to self-management. Also, task-coping self-efficacy (β = 0.28; and p<0.001), outcome expectancies (β = 0.37; p<0.001), risk perception (β = 0.13; p = 0.015) in diet and coping self-efficacy (β = 0.50; p<0.001), outcome expectancies (β = 0.12; p = 0.021) in physical activity were significantly related to behavioral intention. The values of CFI = 0.939 and RMSEA = 0.052 for diet and CFI = 0.948 and RMSEA = 0.048 for physical activity indicated adequate fit. CONCLUSION: HAPA was applicable as a framework for interventions promoting healthy diet and physical activity self-management in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.",

Different types of interventions have been suggested to promote nutritional health in children. This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence from experimental studies on the efficacy of digital media tools for the promotion of a healthy diet in school-aged children. METHODS: According to PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted in the three main electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase e Scopus) until April 2022. We included all experimental studies assessing the effectiveness of digital media tools for nutritional health promotion in children from 5 to 12 years of age. RESULTS: Four studies were included in our analysis, all carried out in school settings. Three of them investigated the use of a videogame, while one study involved watching a cartoon. Each intervention tested was effective in promoting a healthy diet in school-aged children in the short term, regardless of the type of intervention and age of the children involved. A statistically significant increase was observed post-intervention in all studies, both in knowledge of food groups and food frequencies, and in practices (i.e. the amount of fruit and vegetables servings consumed per meal), although the effect faded over time (when follow-up was available). CONCLUSIONS: Digital media tools can be used to effectively implement health promotion interventions to improve knowledge and adherence to healthy diets in school-aged children. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term effectiveness of these interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity and a healthy diet, is increasingly part of type 2 diabetes (T2D) management. As many people with T2D have difficulty living and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, there is a need for effective interventions. eHealth interventions that incorporate behavior change theories and tailoring are considered effective tools for supporting a healthy lifestyle. The E-Supporter 1.0 digital coach contains eHealth content for app-based eHealth interventions and offers tailored coaching regarding physical activity and a healthy diet for people with T2D. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the acceptability of E-Supporter 1.0 and explore its limited efficacy on physical activity, dietary behavior, the phase of behavior change, and self-efficacy levels. METHODS: Over a span of 9 weeks, 20 individuals with T2D received daily motivational messages and weekly feedback derived from behavioral change theories and determinants through E-Supporter 1.0. The acceptability of the intervention was assessed using telephone-conducted, semistructured interviews. The interview transcripts were coded using inductive thematic analysis. The limited efficacy of E-Supporter 1.0 was explored using the Fitbit Charge 2 to monitor step count to assess physical activity and questionnaires to assess dietary behavior (using the Dutch Healthy Diet index), phase of behavior change (using the single-question Self-Assessment Scale Stages of Change), and self-efficacy levels (using the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale). RESULTS: In total, 5 main themes emerged from the interviews: perceptions regarding remote coaching, perceptions regarding the content, intervention intensity and duration, perceived effectiveness, and overall appreciation. The participants were predominantly positive about E-Supporter 1.0. Overall, they experienced E-Supporter 1.0 as a useful and easy-to-use intervention to support a better lifestyle. Participants expressed a preference for combining E-Supporter with face-to-face guidance from a health care professional. Many participants found the intensity and duration of the intervention to be acceptable, despite the coaching period appearing relatively short to facilitate long-term behavior maintenance. As expected, the degree of tailoring concerning the individual and external factors that influence a healthy lifestyle was perceived as limited. The limited efficacy testing showed a significant improvement in the daily step count (z=-2.040; P=.04) and self-efficacy levels (z=-1.997; P=.046) between baseline and postintervention. Diet was improved through better adherence to Dutch dietary guidelines. No significant improvement was found in the phase of behavior change (P=.17), as most participants were already in the maintenance phase at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this explorative feasibility study, we expect E-Supporter 1.0 to be an acceptable and potentially useful intervention to promote physical activity and a healthy diet in people with T2D. Additional work needs to be done to further tailor the E-Supporter content and evaluate its effects more extensively on lifestyle behaviors."

      "abstract": "An Elimination Diet (ED) may be effective in reducing symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but has never been compared to an active control condition [i.e., Healthy Diet (HD)]. In a two-armed RCT, a total of N = 165 children (5-12 years) with ADHD were randomized by means of minimization (1:1) to either an ED (N = 84) or HD (N = 81) within two Dutch child and adolescent psychiatry centers. The design included a non-randomized comparator arm including N = 58 children being treated with Care as Usual (CAU). Treatment allocation was unblinded. The primary outcome was a 5-point ordinal measure of respondership based on a combination of parent and teacher ratings on ADHD and emotion regulation, determined after 5 weeks of treatment. Ordinal regression analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. Fewer ED (35%) than HD (51%) participants showed a partial to full response, despite overall good-to-excellent treatment adherence (> 88%) and comparable high parental prior believes. A younger age and higher problem severity predicted a better respondership. CAU-preferring participants responded more often favorably (56%) compared to ED-but not HD-participants. Small-to-medium improvements in physical health (blood pressure, heart rate, and somatic complaints) were found in response to ED/HD versus decrements in response to CAU (74% received psychostimulants). The lack of superiority of the ED versus HD suggests that for the majority of children, dietary treatment response is not rooted in food-allergies/-sensitivities. The comparable results for treatment with HD and CAU are remarkable given that CAU participants were probably 'easier to treat' than HD (and ED) participants with proportionally fewer with a (suboptimal/non-response to) prior treatment with medication (4% versus 20%). Further assessment of long-term effects is needed to evaluate the potential place of dietary treatment within clinical guidelines. The trial is closed and registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NL5324 ( https://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/25997 ).",

Secondary data analysis was conducted utilising cross-sectional baseline survey data from ANDALE Pittsburgh, a home-based intervention study. Measures included parent-reported information on child dietary intake, screen time and the home environment, and objectively measured physical activity and anthropometry. χ2 and Fischer's exact tests were used to determine associations. The study was conducted in an ELC in western Pennsylvania in the US. Fifty-one Latina mothers (age: 33⋅5 ± 6⋅1 years; 63 % Mexican origin; 86 % low acculturation) and their children (age: 3⋅9 ± 1⋅3 years; 55 % male) 2-5 years of age. On average, children consumed 2⋅25 ± 1⋅44 cups of fruits/vegetables, viewed 98⋅7 ± 74⋅2 min of screen time, accumulated 12⋅9 ± 2⋅9 min/h of total physical activity and consumed 15⋅5 ± 26⋅0 kcals of sugar-sweetened beverages per day. Forty-one percent met the fruit/vegetable recommendation, 54 % met the screen time recommendation, 27 % met the physical activity recommendation and 58 % met the sugary drink recommendation. Country of origin (P = 0⋅032) and acculturation (P = 0⋅048) were significantly associated with children meeting sugary drink recommendations. No other relationships were significant. The proportion of children in this sample meeting diet and activity recommendations was mixed. More research with larger sample sizes is needed in ELCs to identify effective intervention strategies for improving health behaviours.",

Healthy Eating Index (HEI) is a tool used as a valid measurement of the individual's diet quality. We aimed at investigating the relationship between diet quality as assessed by HEI-2015 and the risk of MetS and its components in a cross-sectional sample of suburban individuals from PERSIAN Kavar cohort study (PKCS), Fars province, Iran. METHODS: 2225 individuals meeting the eligibility criteria participated in the study. The relevant data were obtained from the baseline phase of PKCS. MetS was defined according to cut-offs presented by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). HEI-2015 was calculated for the included individuals. Odds ratios were estimated. P-values <0.05 were considered as significant. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of MetS was 27.3%. Individuals with lower HEI-2015 scores had higher odds for MetS and its components. We observed that those who were categorized as the top HEI-2015 tertile had 42% (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38-0.90) lower odds of high blood pressure in the overall population. Also, the odds of high serum triacylglycerol was lower (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.57-0.90) in those with the highest HEI-2015 scores. CONCLUSION: We found that higher dietary quality measured by HEI will decrease the risk of developing MetS, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia among Iranian adults. However, future interventional studies are required to further elucidate the issue.",

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of olive oil and flaxseed consumption as part of a healthy diet on endothelial function, plasma inflammatory factors, and lipid profile in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHOD: This randomized nonblinded trial was performed on CHD patients. In the control group, participants received general heart-healthy dietary recommendations while in the intervention group, in addition to these recommendations, the participants consumed 25 ml of olive oil and 30 g of flaxseeds daily for 3 months. At baseline and after 3 months, changes in brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), plasma asymmetric dimethyl arginine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and lipids and lipoproteins were measured. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients finished the trial ( n  = 24 in the intervention and n  = 26 in the control groups). Compared to the control group, consumption of flaxseed and olive oil significantly improved brachial artery FMD%, and reduced plasma IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, total cholesterol, and tended to reduce hs-CRP, and non-HDL-cholesterol but the concentration of other study indices were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of olive oil and flaxseed in the diet of CHD patients may contribute to secondary prevention by improving endothelial function and plasma inflammatory factors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased uptake of sodium is a major cause for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Reduction of daily salt intake below a reference level of 2 g per day (the equivalent to 5 g salt/day) is known to effectively reduce cardiovascular mortality. The widespread use of social media, with a constant increase in video consumption, is opening new avenues for the dissemination of innovative and scalable approaches to health-related information and recommendations for a healthy diet, such as via video interventions with short animated stories (SAS). OBJECTIVE: This study will evaluate the effect of a sodium intake-SAS video intervention on immediate and medium-term knowledge about dietary sodium. Beyond that, immediate and medium-term effects on behavioral expectation to reduce sodium intake as well as voluntary post-trial engagement with the video content will be examined. METHODS: In this 4-armed, parallel, randomized controlled trial, 10,000 adult, US participants will be randomly assigned to (1) a short, animated storytelling intervention video on sodium as a cardiovascular disease risk factor followed by surveys assessing the facts on sodium and cardiovascular disease conveyed in the video (2) the surveys only, (3) an attention placebo control video followed by the before mentioned surveys, and (4) an arm that is exposed to neither the video nor the surveys. Two weeks later, participants in all four arms will complete all of the surveys. RESULTS: Primary outcomes are the immediate and medium-term effects of the short, animated storytelling intervention video on knowledge about dietary sodium. Secondary outcomes are immediate and medium-term effects of the short, animated storytelling intervention on behavioral expectation to reduce sodium intake as well as voluntary post-trial engagement with the video content. CONCLUSION: This study will extend the knowledge on the effects of short, animated storytelling for the containment of the global cardiovascular disease burden. Knowledge on the groups that may be more likely to voluntarily engage with SAS video content will help to improve targeting of future interventions towards audiences at risk.

A multi-center study was conducted from July 2020 to March 2021 on 972 hemodialysis patients in eight hospitals in Vietnam to explore the factors associated with TA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected, including socio-demographics, an End-Stage Renal Disease Adherence Questionnaire (ESRD-AQ), 12-item short-form health literacy questionnaire (HLS-SF12), 4-item digital healthy diet literacy scale (DDL), 10-item hemodialysis dietary knowledge scale (HDK), 7-item fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S), and suspected COVID-19 symptoms (S-COVID19-S). Bivariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to explore the associations. Higher DDL scores were associated with higher TA scores (regression coefficient, B, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, 0.59, 2.12; p = 0.001). Higher FCoV-19S scores were associated with lower TA scores (B, -1.78; 95%CI, -3.33, -0.24; p = 0.023). In addition, patients aged 60-85 (B, 24.85; 95%CI, 6.61, 43.11; p = 0.008) with \"very or fairly easy\" medication payment ability (B, 27.92; 95%CI, 5.89, 44.95; p = 0.013) had higher TA scores. Patients who underwent hemodialysis for ≥5 years had a lower TA score than those who received <5 years of hemodialysis (B, -52.87; 95%CI, -70.46, -35.28; p < 0.001). These findings suggested that DDL and FCoV-19S, among other factors, should be considered in future interventions to improve TA in hemodialysis patients.",

We assessed the effects of a 12-week lifestyle intervention in children with IBD. METHODS: This study was a randomized semi-crossover controlled trial, investigating a 12-week lifestyle program (3 physical training sessions per week plus personalized healthy dietary advice) in children with IBD. Endpoints were physical fitness (maximal and submaximal exercise capacity, strength, and core stability), patient-reported outcomes (quality of life, fatigue, and fears for exercise), clinical disease activity (fecal calprotectin and disease activity scores), and nutritional status (energy balance and body composition). Change in maximal exercise capacity (peak VO 2 ) was the primary endpoint; all others were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (median age 15 [IQR: 12-16]) completed the program. At baseline, peak VO 2 was reduced (median 73.3% [58.8-100.9] of predicted). After the 12-week program, compared to the control period, peak VO 2 did not change significantly; exercise capacity measured by 6-minute walking test and core-stability did. While medical treatment remained unchanged, Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index decreased significantly versus the control period (15 [3-25] vs 2.5 [0-5], P = 0.012), and fecal calprotectin also decreased significantly but not versus the control period. Quality of life (IMPACT-III) improved on 4 out of 6 domains and total score (+13 points) versus the control period. Parents-reported quality of life on the child health questionnaire and total fatigue score (PedsQoL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale) also improved significantly versus the control period. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week lifestyle intervention improved bowel symptoms, quality of life, and fatigue in pediatric IBD patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Changing current dietary patterns into sustainable healthy diets (ie, healthy diets with low environmental impact and socioeconomic fairness) is urgent. So far, few eating behavior change interventions have addressed all the dimensions of sustainable healthy diets at once and used cutting-edge methods from the field of digital health behavior change. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this pilot study were to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of an individual behavior change intervention toward the adoption of a more environmentally sustainable healthy diet as a whole and changes in specific relevant food groups, food waste, and obtaining food from fair sources. The secondary objectives included the identification of mechanisms of action that potentially mediate the effect of the intervention on behaviors, identification of potential spillover effects and covariations among different food outcomes, and identification of the role of socioeconomic status in behavior changes. METHODS: We will run a series of ABA n-of-1 trials over a year, with the first A phase corresponding to a 2-week baseline evaluation, the B phase to a 22-week intervention, and the second A phase to a 24-week postintervention follow-up. We plan to enroll 21 participants from low, middle, and high socioeconomic statuses, with 7 from each socioeconomic group. The intervention will involve sending text messages and providing brief individualized web-based feedback sessions based on regular app-based assessments of eating behavior. The text messages will contain brief educational messages on human health and the environmental and socioeconomic effects of dietary choices; motivational messages to encourage the adoption of sustainable healthy diets by participants, providing tips to achieve their own behavioral goals; or links to recipes. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected. Quantitative data (eg, on eating behaviors and motivation) will be collected through self-reported questionnaires on several weekly bursts spread through the study. Qualitative data will be collected through 3 individual semistructured interviews before the intervention period, at the end of the intervention period, and at the end of the study. Analyses will be performed at both the individual and group levels depending on the outcome and objective. RESULTS: The first participants were recruited in October 2022. The final results are expected by October 2023. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study will be useful for designing future larger interventions on individual behavior change for sustainable healthy diets.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adolescence is a distinctive period of life when intense physical, psychological, and cognitive development occurs. A healthy diet helps prevent various forms of malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The current study aimed to assess the change in behavioral intentions (measured based on the TPB) toward healthy dietary practices through health promotion intervention among adolescents studying in selected schools in an urban area of West Bengal, India. METHODS: The current study was a non-randomized controlled interventional study conducted among adolescents in either seventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth grades and aged between 12 and 16 years. Two-step cluster analysis with maximum likelihood estimation identified the intenders of a healthy diet. The intervention effect was measured using Relative Risk (RR) for being in the higher intention cluster through Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a log-linear link under Poisson distribution assumptions and robust standard errors. A P-value of 0.05 or lesser was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the mean score of \"Attitude\" in both groups. The mean score of \"Subjective Norm\" among the intervention group increased after intervention, and the difference was statistically significant. The mean score of \"Perceived behavioral control\" in the intervention group increased after the intervention, but the difference was statistically not significant. The intervention group's post-intervention proportion of intenders increased, and the difference was statistically significant. The relative risk of becoming an intender for healthy diet consumption in the Intervention group compared to the Control group was 2.07 (1.44-2.97). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention package effectively brought about a positive change in behavioral intention toward healthy dietary practices among adolescents. Model-based and construct-oriented intervention packages can be adopted in school-setting to promote behavioral intention toward a healthy diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood overweight and obesity is a public health priority. We have previously reported the efficacy of a parent-oriented mobile health (mHealth) app-based intervention (MINISTOP 1.0) which showed improvements in healthy lifestyle behaviors. However, the effectiveness of the MINISTOP app in real-world conditions needs to be established. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a 6-month mHealth intervention (MINISTOP 2.0 app) on children's intake of fruits, vegetables, sweet and savory treats, sweet drinks, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and screen time (primary outcomes), and on parental self-efficacy (PSE) for promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, and children's body mass index (BMI) (secondary outcomes). METHODS: A hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design was utilized. For the effectiveness outcomes, a two-arm, individually randomized controlled trial was conducted. Parents (n = 552) of 2.5-to-3-year-old children were recruited from 19 child health care centers across Sweden, and, randomized to either a control (standard care) or intervention group (MINISTOP 2.0 app). The 2.0 version was adapted and translated into English, Somali and Arabic to increase reach. All recruitment and data collection were conducted by the nurses. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after six months, using standardized measures (BMI) and a questionnaire (health behaviors, PSE). RESULTS: Among the participating parents (n = 552, age: 34.1 ± 5.0 years), 79% were mothers and 62% had a university degree. Twenty-four percent (n = 132) of children had two foreign-born parents. At follow-up, parents in the intervention group reported lower intakes of sweet and savory treats (-6.97 g/day; p = 0.001), sweet drinks (-31.52 g/day; p < 0.001), and screen time (-7.00 min/day; p = 0.012) in their children compared to the control group. The intervention group reported higher total PSE (0.91; p = 0.006), PSE for promoting healthy diet (0.34; p = 0.008) and PSE for promoting physical activity behaviors (0.31; p = 0.009) compared to controls. No statistically significant effect was observed for children's BMI z-score. Overall, parents reported high satisfaction with the app, and 54% reported using the app at least once a week. CONCLUSION: Children in the intervention group had lower intakes of sweet and savory treats, sweet drinks, less screen time (primary outcomes) and their parents reported higher PSE for promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors. Our results from this real-world effectiveness trial support the implementation of the MINISTOP 2.0 app within Swedish child health care.

The MED-E project's primary aim is to assess the effect of the different 3-month sustainable healthy diet (SHD) and multicomponent training (MT) interventions on several health outcomes in the elderly. A quasi-experimental study assigned older adults into four groups: (1) SHD, (2) MT, (3) SHD + MT, or (4) control group (CG). The SHD intervention included a weekly offer of a mixed food supply and individual and group nutritional sessions on the principles of an SHD. The MT groups were submitted to 50-min exercise sessions three times a week. The primary outcomes were blood biomarkers and metabolic profile alterations that were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Additionally, data on dietary intake and nutritional adequacy, physical fitness, body composition and anthropometry, cognitive function, quality of life, and geographical data were assessed at the same time points. The MED-E project's study protocol and future results will add to knowledge about the importance and beneficial contribution of combined SHD and MT interventions on healthy ageing policies.",

The program is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and is supported by life skills training. The recipients of the program were high school students (n = 367; 168 boys and 199 girls) from 14 schools in Greece who attended 10 1 h sessions implemented by their schoolteachers. Data were collected before and after the program implementation through online questionnaires for: a. attitude, intention, subjective norms, and PBC toward healthy eating; b. knowledge about healthy eating; c. exercise behavior and attitude toward the DIEX program; and d. satisfaction with the DIEX program (only post-program). The results showed that there were significant differences among the pre- and post-measures of students' knowledge and behavior about healthy diet, as well as attitudes and satisfaction toward the program's application. The results show that the DIEX program may have improved nutrition behavior variables. Conclusively, a theory-based behavioral intervention with skills training may result in positive behavioral changes for young students during health education in school settings with the assistance of new technologies."

Lack of access to healthy foods, sedentary behaviour, and other social environmental factors contribute to disease risk. Yup'ik Alaska Native communities are experiencing lifestyle changes that are likely to affect their cardiometabolic risks. Barrera & Castro's Cultural Adaptation Framework was used to adapt an evidence-based intervention (EBI) originally designed for Latino communities for use in Yup'ik communities. Focus groups and key informant interviews were held in two Yup'ik communities. Major themes included causes of obesity, barriers and facilitators to healthy foods and physical activity, and intervention ideas. The adaptation process was guided by a Community Planning Group of Yup'ik women and included information gathering, preliminary adaptation design, preliminary adaptation tests, and adaptation refinement. Two of the adapted educational modules were pilot tested. Involving community members as co-researchers in cultural adaptation is vital for an EBI to be effective in another population. Small group gatherings led by local lay health workers are culturally appropriate and may be an effective health promotion model in Yup'ik communities. Social environmental factors affecting healthy food availability and physical activity need further exploration.",

      "abstract": "The tryptophan-kynurenine pathway has been linked to cancer aetiology and survivorship, and diet potentially affects metabolites of this pathway, but evidence to date is scarce. Among 247 stage I-III CRC survivors, repeated measurements were performed at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year post-treatment. Adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund/ American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF) and Dutch Healthy Diet (DHD) recommendations was operationalized using seven-day dietary records. Plasma kynurenines of nine metabolites were analysed. Longitudinal associations of adherence to these dietary patterns and plasma kynurenines were analysed using confounder-adjusted linear mixed-models. In general, higher adherence to the dietary WCRF/AICR and DHD recommendations was associated with lower concentrations of kynurenines with pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory, and neurotoxic properties (3-hydroxykynurenine (HK) and quinolinic acid (QA)), and higher concentrations of kynurenines with anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties (kynurenic acid (KA) and picolinic acid (Pic)), but associations were weak and not statistically significant. Statistically significant positive associations between individual recommendations and kynurenines were observed for: nuts with kynurenic-acid-to-quinolinic-acid ratio (KA/QA); alcohol with KA/QA, KA, and xanthurenic acid (XA); red meat with XA; and cheese with XA. Statistically significant inverse associations were observed for: nuts with kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio (KTR) and hydroxykynurenine ratio; alcohol with KTR; red meat with 3-hydroxyanthranilic-to-3-hydroxykynurenine ratio; ultra-processed foods with XA and KA/QA; and sweetened beverages with KA/QA. Our findings suggest that CRC survivors might benefit from adhering to the dietary WCRF and DHD recommendations in the first year after treatment, as higher adherence to these dietary patterns is generally, but weakly associated with more favourable concentrations of kynurenines and their ratios. These results need to be validated in other studies.",

Behavioral-economic approaches may improve the incentivization effectiveness. This study compares and ranks the effectiveness of standard and behavioral incentivization for healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity promotion. PURPOSE: To investigate whether behavioral-economic insights improve incentivization effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline and Scopus was performed from database inception to December 2020. Study characteristics, program designs, and risk ratio (RR) were extracted. A two-stage network meta-analysis pooled and ranked intervention effects. RESULTS: There were 35 eligible RCTs. For diet-weight control, standard FI, deposit contract (deposit), lottery-based incentive (lottery), and standard-FI + lottery increased goal achievement compared to no-FI but only deposit was statistically significant with pooled RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 1.21 (0.94, 1.56), 1.79 (1.04, 3.05), 1.45 (0.99, 2.13), and 1.73 (0.83, 3.63). For physical activity, standard-FI, deposit, and lottery significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI, with pooled RRs of 1.38 (1.13, 1.68), 1.63 (1.24, 2.14) and 1.43 (1.14, 1.80), respectively. In a follow-up period for physical activity, only deposit significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI, with pooled RRs of 1.39 (1.11, 1.73). CONCLUSION: Deposit, followed by lottery, were best for motivating healthy diet, weight control and physical activity at program end. Post-intervention, deposit then standard-FI were best for motivating physical activity. Behavioral insights can improve incentivization effectiveness, although lottery-based approaches may offer only short-term benefit regarding physical activity. However, the imprecise intervention effects were major concerns.",

METHODS: A pragmatic randomized pilot trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of a web-app-based intervention for women without breast cancer diagnosis. Women in the intervention group participated in a 6-month intervention web-app based on the Behaviour Change Wheel Model. The web-app includes information about breast cancer risk factors, early detection, physical activity and diet. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-fifth women aged 25-50 were invited to join the study. Two hundred and twenty-four were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (IG = 134) or control group (CG = 90) according to their place of residence. Adherence among women in the IG increased significantly from pre- to post-intervention for eight of the 12 healthy behaviors and for the identification of six risk factors and six symptoms compared to women in the CG and, among whom adherence only increased for two behaviors, the identification of one risk factor and 0 symptoms. The intervention significantly improved the mean number of risk factors + 1.06 (p < 0.001) and symptoms + 1.18 (p < 0.001) identified by women in the IG. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results of this study suggest that an educational intervention using a web-app and based on the Behaviour Change Wheel model could be useful to improve knowledge of breast cancer risk factors and symptoms and to improve adherence to a healthy diet and physical activity in women without a previous breast cancer diagnosis.",

A rat model of maternal obesity to examine whether a diet switch intervention could reverse the adverse effects of an unhealthy postweaning diet is used. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male and female offspring born to dams fed standard chow or a high-fat, high-sugar \"cafeteria\" (Caf) diet are weaned onto chow or Caf diets until 22 weeks of age, when Caf-fed groups are switched to chow for 5 weeks. Adiposity, gut microbiota composition, and place recognition memory are assessed before and after the switch. Body weight and adiposity fall in switched groups but remain significantly higher than chow-fed controls. Nonetheless, the diet switch improves a deficit in place recognition memory observed in Caf-fed groups, increases gut microbiota species richness, and alters β diversity. Modeling indicate that adiposity most strongly predicts gut microbiota composition before and after the switch. CONCLUSION: Maternal obesity does not alter the effects of switching diet on metabolic, microbial, or cognitive measures. Thus, a healthy diet intervention lead to major shifts in body weight, adiposity, place recognition memory, and gut microbiota composition, with beneficial effects preserved in offspring born to obese dams.",

      "abstract": "Background: People with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) have increased energy requirements. However, in recent years concerns have emerged regarding the 'cystic fibrosis (CF) diet' in terms of reliance on energy-dense, nutrient poor foods, which tend to be higher in saturated fat, sugar, and salt. These foods lack essential nutrients and are aetiologically linked with diet-related chronic diseases. The aim is to explore habitual dietary intakes in PWCF and (i) assess adherence to CF dietary guidelines and population specific healthy eating guidelines; (ii) derive a diet quality score and the inflammatory potential for the average diet consumed by PWCF and assess associations with patient reported outcome measures; (iii) assess drivers for current consumption patterns and enablers and barriers to eating a healthy diet. Methods: The aim is to recruit between 100-180 PWCF. A mixed methods study will be performed. Using three-day food diaries and food frequency questionnaires, aims (i) and (ii) will be addressed. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and Healthy Eating Index-International (HEI-I) will derive diet quality scores. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) will ascertain inflammatory potential of the diet. Validated questionnaires will be used to report health related quality of life measures. Online focus groups and semi-structured interview with PWCF will address aim (iii). Conclusions: It is timely to revise dietary priorities and targets for CF. However, a greater understanding of what adults with CF currently consume and what they require in terms of nutrition and dietary guidance into the future is needed. In doing so, this research will help to clarify nutrition priorities and simplify the dietary aspects of CF treatment, thereby supporting adherence."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Innovations are needed for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and for reaching diverse communities in remote regions. The current study reports on a telemedicine-delivered intervention promoting a traditional heart-healthy diet and medication adherence with Alaska Native men and women residing in the Norton Sound region of Alaska. METHODS: Participants were 299 men and women with high blood pressure or high cholesterol smoking daily who were randomized to receive telemedicine-delivered counseling and printed materials on diet and medication adherence or on smoking and physical activity. Intervention contacts were at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-months follow-up, with a final assessment at 18 months. Nutrition outcomes were the ratio of heart-healthy foods and traditional heart-healthy foods relative to all foods reported on a 34-item food frequency questionnaire. Recent and typical adherence for heart medications were self-reported. RESULTS: Intervention effects were significant for the heart-healthy foods ratio at 6 months only (p = 0.014) and significant for the traditional heart-healthy foods ratio at 6 months only for those aged 47+ (p = 0.031). For recent and typical medication adherence, there were no significant group differences by time. DISCUSSION: In a remote region of Alaska, telemedicine proved feasible and acceptable for engaging Alaska Native men and women in counseling on CVD risk behaviors. The findings indicate that more touchpoints may be necessary to impart comprehensive lasting change in heart-healthy eating patterns. Medication adherence group differences were not significant; however, medication adherence was high overall.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effect of the pandemic period on 66 children (aged 5-18 years) with type 1 diabetes using scales evaluating family functionality, nutritional habits, adherence to treatment and depression status. DESIGN: It is a cross-sectional clinical and laboratory study using certain scales for its descriptive features. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, laboratory investigations were evaluated. Family functionality of the patients were evaluated with Smilkstein's family APGAR scale, motivation and knowledge levels were evaluated with the 6-item Morisky medication adherence scale (MMAS-6), nutritional habits were evaluated with the Mediterranean diet quality index (KIDMED), and depression status was evaluated with the children depression inventory (CDI). RESULTS: The mean HbA1c level increased significantly in the first year of the pandemic compared to the onset of the pandemic period (8.5% vs. 8.9%, p: 0.003). In the responses to these scales, children with diabetes have high family functionality (89.4%), high motivation (90.9%) and high knowledge level about adherence to treatment (97%). Furthermore, healthy eating habits (high KIDMED index scores 92.4%), and low degree of depression score (95.5%) have been observed. We detected a statistically significant positive correlation between HbA1c and CDI scores (r: 0.27; p: 0.02), and a negative correlation between HbA1c and MMAS-6 motivation score (r: -0.30; p: 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the effect of motivation and mood changes on glycemic control was more clearly demonstrated."

Daily food consumption was estimated by the single 24 h dietary recall method. Antioxidant vitamins (C, E, and β-carotene) and minerals (Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu) from the diet and supplements were calculated using 5D Diet software, and dietary total polyphenol intake (DTPI) was determined using the Phenol-Explorer database and our database. Total diet quality was measured by the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the prevention of CVD. DTAC was calculated using the data on food consumption and the antioxidant potential of foods measured by the FRAP (ferric ion reducing antioxidant potential) method. It was shown that higher DTAC was associated with a higher intake of polyphenols, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals. Moreover, a higher quartile of DTAC was associated with a reduced odds ratio for cardiovascular diseases in a Polish population, as well as with a higher HDI. Therefore, dietary recommendations for the prevention and therapy of CVDs should take into account a high DTAC. DTAC, measured by the FRAP method, can be considered an indicator of healthy diet quality.",

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to August 2021 that tested mobile health (mHealth) PA and/or dietary interventions among cancer survivors and reported on the feasibility, satisfaction, behavioral change, and/or quality of life (QOL) outcomes. Results: In total, 61 articles were identified on PubMed, and 23 of those met the inclusion criteria. The most common cancers were breast (n = 1000), prostate (n = 713), and colorectal (n = 650). Participants were predominantly White (median: 84%, interquartile range (IQR): 20%) and college-educated (58%). The interventions varied, but the most common combination of components (six studies) was a website/mobile app with an activity tracker and coaching. In terms of duration, 70% (n = 16) of the interventions lasted 12 weeks. The median total tracker wear was 87% of the study days (IQR: 6%) and the median text-message reply rate was 73% (IQR 4%). Most participants (median: 87%; IQR: 16%) were satisfied with at least one intervention component. Eleven out of 18 studies examining behavioral change reported significant between-group differences and six out of 11 studies examining QoL reported significant improvements. Conclusions: mHealth interventions are a promising approach to improving the PA and diets of cancer survivors. Research in racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse populations is needed."

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the evidence on benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity in adults without known cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors to inform a US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through February 2021, with ongoing surveillance through February 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of behavioral counseling interventions targeting improved diet, increased physical activity, or decreased sedentary time among adults without known elevated blood pressure, elevated lipid levels, or impaired fasting glucose. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent data abstraction and study quality rating and random effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: CVD events, CVD risk factors, diet and physical activity measures, and harms. RESULTS: One-hundred thirteen RCTs were included (N = 129 993). Three RCTs reported CVD-related outcomes: 1 study (n = 47 179) found no significant differences between groups on any CVD outcome at up to 13.4 years of follow-up; a combined analysis of the other 2 RCTs (n = 1203) found a statistically significant association of the intervention with nonfatal CVD events (hazard ratio, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.88]) and fatal CVD events (hazard ratio, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.93]) at 4 years. Diet and physical activity behavioral counseling interventions were associated with small, statistically significant reductions in continuous measures of blood pressure (systolic mean difference, -0.8 [95% CI, -1.3 to -0.3]; 23 RCTs [n = 57 079]; diastolic mean difference, -0.4 [95% CI, -0.8 to -0.0]; 24 RCTs [n = 57 148]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (mean difference, 2.2 mg/dL [95% CI, -3.8 to -0.6]; 15 RCTs [n = 6350]), adiposity-related outcomes (body mass index mean difference, -0.3 [95% CI, -0.5 to -0.1]; 27 RCTs [n = 59 239]), dietary outcomes, and physical activity at 6 months to 1.5 years of follow-up vs control conditions. There was no evidence of greater harm among intervention vs control groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Healthy diet and physical activity behavioral counseling interventions for persons without a known risk of CVD were associated with small but statistically significant benefits across a variety of important intermediate health outcomes and small to moderate effects on dietary and physical activity behaviors. There was limited evidence regarding the long-term health outcomes or harmful effects of these interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: More than one-fifth of the world's population consumes Chinese cuisines regularly, but no evidence-based healthy diets fitting the Chinese food culture are available for implementation. METHODS: A multicenter, patient- and outcome assessor-blind, randomized feeding trial was conducted among 265 participants with 130 to 159 mm Hg baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) for 4 major Chinese cuisines (Shangdong, Huaiyang, Cantonese, Szechuan). After a 7-day run-in period on a control diet matching the usual local diets, participants were randomized to continue with the control diet or the cuisine-based Chinese heart-healthy diet for another 28 days. The primary outcome was SBP, and secondary outcomes included diastolic blood pressure and food preference score. Linear regression models were used to estimate the intervention effects and adjustments for the center. The incremental cost per 1 mm Hg reduction in SBP was also calculated. RESULTS: A total of 265 participants were randomized (135 on the Chinese heart-healthy diet and 130 on the control diet), with 52% women, mean age of 56.5±9.8 years, and mean SBP and diastolic blood pressure of 139.4±8.3 and 88.1±8.0 mm Hg, respectively, at baseline. The change in SBP and diastolic blood pressure from baseline to the end of the study in the control group was -5.0 (95% CI, -6.5 to -3.5) mm Hg and -2.8 (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.9) mm Hg, respectively. The net difference of change between the 2 groups in SBP and diastolic blood pressure were -10.0 (95% CI, -12.1 to -7.9) mm Hg and -3.8 (95% CI, -5.0 to -2.5) mm Hg, respectively. The effect size did not differ among cuisines (P for interaction=0.173). The mean food preference score was 9.5 (with 10 the best preferred) at baseline, and the net change during intervention was 0.1 (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; P=0.558). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per 1 mm Hg SBP reduction was CNY 0.4 (USD 0.06) per day. No difference in the number of adverse events was found between the 2 groups (P=0.259), and none of the adverse events was associated with the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese heart-healthy diet is effective, palatable, and cost-effective in reducing blood pressure in Chinese adults with high blood pressure, with a clinically significant effect applicable across major Chinese cuisine cultures.

This umbrella review aims to evaluate the effects of diet and/or physical activity interventions during pregnancy on preventing GDM. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reporting preventive effects of diet and/or physical activity in reducing the incidence of GDM were included from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane library. Two authors independently assessed the overlapping and quality of the 35 selected reviews using AMSTAR 2. The results, although variable, tend to defend the protective role of diet and physical activity interventions separately and independently of each other in the prevention of GDM. However, the results for the combined interventions show a possible protective effect; however, it is not entirely clear because most of the analyzed meta-analyses tend to approach 1, and heterogeneity cannot be ruled out. Establishing conclusions about the most efficient type of intervention and a dose-effect relationship was not feasible given the low quality of systematic reviews (83% low to critically low) and the variability in reporting interventions. Therefore, more studies with better quality and definition of the interventions are required. The protocol was previously registered in PROSPERO as CRD42021237895.",

Observational evidence shows a clear link between prevention and development of invasive BC and lifestyle-based interventions such as a healthy diet and physical activity. The recent findings reveal that even minimal amounts of daily exercise and a healthy diet reduced the risk of BC, mitigated the side effects of cancer treatment, and stopped the recurrence of cancer in the survivors. Despite the myriad benefits, the implementation of these lifestyle interventions in at-risk and survivor populations has been limited to date. Given the need to disseminate information about the role of physical activity and nutrition in BC reduction, the review aimed to present the recent scientific outreach and update on associations between the lifestyle interventions and BC outcomes to narrow the gap and strengthen the understanding more clearly. This review covers more direct, detailed, and updated scientific literature to respond to frequently asked questions related to the daily lifestyle-based interventions and their impact on BC risk and survivors. This review also highlights the importance of the oncology provider's job and how oncology education can reduce the BC burden.",

An important element of the environment is market imperfections in food retail that distort prices. We use a rich dataset on quantities and prices of food purchases in the United States and a structural model of dietary choices to examine variation in diets across households that have different levels of income and live in different neighborhoods. We find that price distortions account for one-third of the gap between the recommended and actual intake of fruits and vegetables. A feasible fiscal intervention that remedies these distortions makes all consumers better off."

Totally seventy menus, which consisted of LSHP diets and the usual diets for a 7-d cycle, were composed from the analysis of the Indonesian food composition database. The correlation coefficient of the potassium content of all menus with nutritional quality and diet cost was analysed using the Pearson test. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the most important nutrient in determining diet cost. A comparison of nutrition quality and diet cost from the two menus was analysed using the independent t-test. LSHP diet had significantly higher carbohydrate, protein, fibre, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, potassium density and diet cost but lower total fat, saturated fat and energy density than the usual diet (P < 0⋅05). Furthermore, there was a strong positive correlation between fibre, potassium and diet cost (coefficient correlation of >0⋅8). Potassium is a nutrient that is closely related to diet quality although the cost of the diet often may inhibit its intake. A targeted and effective strategy is required to provide affordable food for achieving a sustainable nutrient-rich diet.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate the diet quality of tuberculosis patients and healthy adults by using the China Healthy Diet Index (CHDI) and to provide guidance for the diet of tuberculosis patients in the future. METHODS: A case-control study of 1241 patients and 1241 healthy individuals matchedfor sex and age. The CHDI was used to score the overall diet quality of patients in the casegroup and the control group. RESULTS: The CHDI score of tuberculosis patients was 61.61 and that of healthy controls was 63.97. After adjustment for confounders, participants with >80 on CHDI were 73.5% less likely to develop tuberculosis than participants with <51 (OR: 0.265, 95% CI: 0.086, 0.813, p < 0.05). In the original model, the CHDI scores in the highest range were inversely associated with tuberculosis risk compared with the lowest range (OR: 0.687, 95% CI: 0.420,1.122, p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, the CHDI score was significantly associated with a reduced risk of tuberculosis (OR: 0.265, 95% CI: 0.086, 0.813, p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, a high-quality diet was positively correlated with anti-tuberculosis treatment outcomes (OR:0.957, 95% CI: 0.918,0.998, p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Compared with healthy adults, tuberculosis patients have poor diet quality with unreasonable diet structure. The insufficient intake of whole grains, vegetables, beans, aquatic products, meat and eggs and the excessive intake of pure energy food and solid fat suggests that the dietary structure of tuberculosis patients was unreasonable. This study provides an idea of the diet structure of tuberculosis patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caregivers' influence on young children's eating behaviors is widely recognized. Nutritional interventions that focus on the promotion of children's healthy diet should actively involve parents, focusing on their feeding behaviors and practices. METHODS: This work aims to describe the development and study protocol of the SmartFeeding4Kids (SF4K) program, an online self-guided 7-session intervention for parents of young (2-6 years old) children. The program is informed by social cognitive, self-regulation, and habit formation theoretical models and uses self-regulatory techniques as self-monitoring, goal setting, and feedback to promote behavior change. We propose to examine the intervention efficacy on children's intake of fruit, vegetables, and added sugars, and parental feeding practices with a two-arm randomized controlled with four times repeated measures design (baseline, immediately, 3 and 6 months after intervention). Parental perceived barriers about food and feeding, food parenting self-efficacy, and motivation to change will be analyzed as secondary outcomes. The study of the predictors of parents' dropout rates and the trajectories of parents' and children's outcomes are also objectives of this work. DISCUSSION: The SmartFeeding4Kids program relies on technological resources to deliver parents' self-regulation techniques that proved effective in promoting health behaviors. The study design can enhance the knowledge about the most effective methodologies to change parental feeding practices and children's food intake. As a self-guided online program, SmartFeeding4Kids might overcome parents' attrition more effectively, besides being easy to disseminate and cost-effective.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a) a Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) intervention on reducing smoking, increasing physical activity and adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern in people aged 45-75 years compared to usual care; and b) an implementation strategy. METHODS: A cluster randomised effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial-type 2 with two parallel groups was conducted in 25 Spanish Primary Health Care (PHC) centres (3062 participants): 12 centres (1481 participants) were randomised to the intervention and 13 (1581 participants) to the control group (usual care). The intervention was based on the Transtheoretical Model and focused on all target behaviours using individual, group and community approaches. PHC professionals made it during routine care. The implementation strategy was based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Data were analysed using generalised linear mixed models, accounting for clustering. A mixed-methods data analysis was used to evaluate implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity) and determinants of implementation success. RESULTS: 14.5% of participants in the intervention group and 8.9% in the usual care group showed a positive change in two or all the target behaviours. Intervention was more effective in promoting dietary behaviour change (31.9% vs 21.4%). The overall adoption rate by professionals was 48.7%. Early and final appropriateness were perceived by professionals as moderate. Early acceptability was high, whereas final acceptability was only moderate. Initial and final acceptability as perceived by the participants was high, and appropriateness moderate. Consent and recruitment rates were 82.0% and 65.5%, respectively, intervention uptake was 89.5% and completion rate 74.7%. The global value of the percentage of approaches with fidelity ≥50% was 16.7%. Eight CFIR constructs distinguished between high and low implementation, five corresponding to the Inner Setting domain. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to usual care, the EIRA intervention was more effective in promoting MHBC and dietary behaviour change. Implementation outcomes were satisfactory except for the fidelity to the planned intervention, which was low. The organisational and structural contexts of the centres proved to be significant determinants of implementation effectiveness. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03136211 .

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: It is difficult to change dietary habits and maintain them in the long run, particularly in elderly people. We aimed to assess whether adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and cardiovascular risk factor were similar in the middle-aged and oldest participants in the PREDIMED study. METHODS: We analyzed participants belonging to the first and fourth quartiles of age (Q1 and Q4, respectively) to compare between-group differences in adherence to the nutritional intervention and cardiovascular risk factor (CRF) control during a 3-year follow-up. All participants underwent yearly clinical, nutritional, and laboratory assessments during the following. RESULTS: A total of 2278 patients were included (1091 and 1187 in Q1 and Q4, respectively). At baseline, mean ages were 59.6 ± 2.1 years in Q1 and 74.2 ± 2.6 years in Q4. In Q4, there were more women, greater prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and lower obesity and smoking rates than the younger cohort (P ≤ 0.001, all). Adherence to the MedDiet was similar in Q1 and Q4 at baseline (mean 8.7 of 14 points for both) and improved significantly (P < 0.01) and to a similar extent (mean 10.2 and 10.0 points, respectively) during follow-up. Systolic blood pressure, low density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and body weight were similarly reduced at 3 years in Q1 and Q4 participants. CONCLUSION: The youngest and oldest participants showed improved dietary habits and CRFs to a similar extent after 3 years' intervention. Therefore, it is never too late to improve dietary habits and ameliorate CRF in high-risk individuals, even those of advanced age.

      "abstract": "Many reports detail taste dysfunction in humans and animals with obesity. For example, mice consuming an obesogenic diet for a short period have fewer taste buds than their lean littermates. Further, rats with diet-induced obesity (DIO) show blunted electrophysiological responses to taste in the brainstem. Here, we studied the effects of high energy diet (HED)-induced peripheral taste damage in rats, and whether this deficiency could be reversed by returning to a regular chow diet. Separate groups of rats consumed a standard chow diet (Chow), a HED for 10 weeks followed by a return to chow (HED/chow), or a HED for 10 weeks followed by a restricted HED that was isocaloric with consumption by the HED/chow group (HED/isocal). Fungiform taste papilla (FP) and circumvallate taste bud abundance were quantified several months after HED groups switched diets. Results showed that both HED/chow and HED/isocal rats had significantly fewer FP and lower CV taste bud abundance than control rats fed only chow. Neutrophil infiltration into taste tissues was also quantified, but did not vary with treatment on this timeline. Finally, the number of cells undergoing programmed cell death, measured with caspase-3 staining, inversely correlated with taste bud counts, suggesting taste buds may be lost to apoptosis as a potential mechanism for the taste dysfunction observed in obesity. Collectively, these data show that DIO has lasting deleterious effects on the peripheral taste system, despite a change from a HED to a healthy diet, underscoring the idea that obesity rather than diet predicts damage to the taste system.",

Epidemiological studies have established a link between the consumption of tomatoes, which contain carotenoids, and a reduction in the risk of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Ripe tomato fruits are dark red in color due to the carotenoid lycopene, which is synthesized during fruit ripening. The aim of this review was to summarize and analyze modern data on the role of tomatoes and their processed products in healthy human nutrition. Results. The beneficial effects of this vegetable on bone health, cognitive function, and the cardiovascular system have been studied. However, large intervention studies are needed to confirm a real causal relationship between tomato consumption and the risk of these diseases. Given the presence of various useful bioactive components in tomatoes, the results of most studies provide a reason to include more tomatoes and their processed products in the diet. However, both excessive and regular consumption of this vegetable can cause some side effects in the human body. Conclusion. Recent studies highlight the relationship between tomato consumption and a reduced risk of various diseases such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Tomatoes, thanks to the bioactive substances they contain, with an adequate level of consumption, can become effective component of a healthy diet.",

This cross-sectional study was conducted on COVID-19 survivors in Saudi Arabia to investigate the influence of a healthy diet on the recovery time from COVID-19. A questionnaire was developed to assess participants' dietary habits, based on the 2015 Dutch food-based dietary guidelines. A total of 738 COVID-19 survivors participated in the study, of whom 237 (32.1%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment while 501 (76.9%) were not hospitalized, and 320 (43.4%) were females and 418 (56.6%) were males. Overall, no significant difference was noted in healthy diet score between males and females; however, this score was significantly lower for Saudis compared to non-Saudis. Among the non-hospitalized patients, eating a more healthy diet was associated with a shorter duration of recovery (p < 0.05) and was significantly affected by gender (15.8 ± 9.3 male vs. 12.1 ± 8.9 female; p < 0.001) and marital status (12.1 ± 8.4 singles vs. 13.7 ± 9.3 married vs. 16.1 ± 11.8 divorced; p < 0.05). In contrast, no significant correlation was found with age or BMI. In this study, a more healthy diet was associated with a shorter duration of recovery from COVID-19. However, further studies are needed to thoroughly investigate the relationship between diet and recovery time from COVID-19.",

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention in promoting physical activity (PA) and healthy diet and its implications on body mass index and glycemic control in adults with diabetes attending primary care. METHODS: A one year 1:1 cluster randomized controlled trial will be utilized to compare the use of phone consultations, a multi component interactive phone application and pedometers with the usual diabetes care on promoting PA and healthy diet. Participants will be screened for inactivity and should be T2D, aged18-65 years, and overweight or obese. Eight primary centers will be randomly selected in each arm (n = 375). The primary outcome is the between arms differences in PA and diet scores, BMI and HbA1c over 12 months from baseline. Additionally, secondary outcomes will include cardiovascular outcomes (BP, and lipids). The trial has received ethical approval from the Omani Research and Ethical Review and Approval Committee. All eligible participants will be invited to their respected health centers to provide informed consent. DISCUSSION: This study will contribute to the integration of healthy lifestyle approach using artificial intelligence to primary diabetes care.

      "abstract": "Physical activity and healthy diet are recognized as effective approaches for disease prevention. Controlled laboratory clinical trials support these approaches, yet minimal data exists supporting implementation of exercise as medicine within a healthcare setting. Objectives: To understand perception and barriers to exercise and nutrition from patients and physicians from a family medicine clinic (FMC) to inform the implementation of a laboratory-based exercise and nutrition lifestyle intervention (Phase I), and to determine the feasibility, adherence, and preliminary outcomes of implementing this lifestyle intervention into a FMC (Phase II). Methods: In phase I 10 patients and 5 physicians were interviewed regarding perceptions of exercise and nutrition practices. In phase II patients at risk for cardiovascular disease were enrolled into a lifestyle intervention (n = 16), within a FMC, manipulating diet and exercise. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), body composition, and metabolic blood markers were completed at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and at 24 weeks. Feasibility was defined by patients who completed the intervention and number of sessions vs. total available. Results: Prescribing high-intensity interval training and a meal replacement for 12 weeks in patients with at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease, was shown to have moderate feasibility with 62.5% (n = 10) for patients completing the 12 week intervention, and poor feasibility for assessing effects 12 weeks after cessation of the intervention, with 50% (n = 5) participants returning. Tracking exercise electronically via FitBit had moderate fidelity (n = 9), with hardcopy logs yielding poor compliance (n = 6). This pilot study demonstrated preliminary effectiveness of this home-based approach for improving cardiorespiratory fitness with an average 4.31 ± 5.67 ml·kg·min-1 increase in peak oxygen consumption. Blood triglycerides and insulin were improved in 70% and 60% of the patients, respectively. Conclusions: Despite moderate feasibility, a home-based exercise and nutrition has the potential to be used as an effective approach for managing and mitigating cardiovascular disease risk factors. There were key lessons learned which will help to develop and adapt a larger scale lifestyle intervention into a clinical setting.

      "abstract": "The Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial (WHIRCDMT) was designed to test whether the US Department of Agriculture's 1977 Dietary Guidelines for Americans protects against coronary heart disease (CHD) and other chronic diseases. The only significant finding in the original 2006 WHIRCDMT publication was that postmenopausal women with CHD randomised to a low-fat 'heart-healthy' diet in 1993 were at 26% greater risk of developing additional CHD events compared with women with CHD eating the control diet. A 2017 WHIRCDMT publication includes data for an additional 5 years of follow-up. It finds that CHD risk in this subgroup of postmenopausal women had increased further to 47%-61%. The authors present three post-hoc rationalisations to explain why this finding is 'inadmissible': (1) only women in this subgroup were less likely to adhere to the prescribed dietary intervention; (2) their failure to follow the intervention diet increased their CHD risk; and (3) only these women were more likely to not have received cholesterol-lowering drugs. These rationalisations appear spurious. Rather these findings are better explained as a direct consequence of postmenopausal women with features of insulin resistance (IR) eating a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 13 years. All the worst clinical features of IR, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in some, can be 'reversed' by the prescription of a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet. The Women's Health Study has recently reported that T2DM (10.71-fold increased risk) and other markers of IR including metabolic syndrome (6.09-fold increased risk) were the most powerful predictors of future CHD development in women; blood low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration was a poor predictor (1.38-fold increased risk). These studies challenge the prescription of the low-fat high-carbohydrate heart-healthy diet, at least in postmenopausal women with IR, especially T2DM. According to the medical principle of 'first do no harm', this practice is now shown to be not evidence-based, making it scientifically unjustifiable, perhaps unethical.",

Many women with breast cancer do not follow these guidelines and delay efforts toward following them until active treatment is complete. However, adoption of these recommended lifestyle behaviors soon after diagnosis may prevent adverse treatment-related side effects and may improve adherence to treatment, resulting in improved breast cancer prognosis. The Lifestyle, Exercise, and Nutrition Early after Diagnosis (LEANer) study is testing the effect of a nutrition and physical activity intervention on chemotherapy completion rates. METHODS: 172 women with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy will be randomized 1:1 to a yearlong, 16 session, nutrition and exercise intervention or usual care control group. The intervention is delivered by registered dietitians specializing in oncology nutrition and exercise training. The intervention includes goal setting to meet nutrition and physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors. After each chemotherapy session, date and dose of each drug administered, and reason for dose-adjustments and/or dose-delays are abstracted from the electronic medical record or obtained from the treating oncologist. Chemotherapy completion rate is assessed as the average relative dose-intensity (RDI) for the originally planned regimen based on standard formulas. Secondary endpoints of endocrine therapy adherence, treatment-related side effects, and changes in inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, body composition, and patient reported outcomes are assessed at four timepoints. DISCUSSION: If successful, this study has the potential to make healthy lifestyle interventions a standard component of breast cancer treatment.",

METHODS: One hundred-thirty patients who underwent heart valve replacement surgery in our hospital from January 2018 to January 2020 were enrolled as the research subjects. They were randomly divided into study group (65 patients, phased written health education combined with health Diet) and control group (65 cases, routine health education). The drug compliance and the degree of anticoagulant drugs knowledge were compared between the two groups in the first and second stage rehabilitation and the recovery stage. The health behavior ability and quality of life at different phases were also observed. RESULTS: During the first and the second stage rehabilitation, and the recovery stage, the drug compliance of the study group was superior to that of the control group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the knowledge of anticoagulant drugs in the study group was better than that in the control group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Before intervention, there was no significant difference in health behavior ability and quality of life between the two groups (P > 0.05). The healthy behavior ability of study group for each stage was superior to the control group, the difference was significant (P < 0.05). The healthy behavior ability and quality of life showed the same results with statistical significance (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of phased written health education combined with healthy diet in patients after heart valve replacement can effectively improve patients' medication compliance, anticoagulant drugs knowledge, healthy behavior ability and quality of life at different stages, and is worthy of clinical application.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poor-quality diet is associated with one in five deaths globally. In the United States, it is the leading cause of death, representing a bigger risk factor than even smoking. For many, education on a healthy diet comes from their physician. However, as few as 25% of medical schools currently offer a dedicated nutrition course. We hypothesized that an active learning, culinary nutrition experience for medical students would improve the quality of their diets and better equip them to counsel future patients on food and nutrition. METHODS: This was a prospective, interventional, uncontrolled, non-randomized, pilot study. Ten first-year medical students at the Wayne State University School of Medicine completed a 4-part, 8-h course in culinary-nutritional instruction and hands-on cooking. Online assessment surveys were completed immediately prior to, immediately following, and 2 months after the intervention. There was a 100% retention rate and 98.8% item-completion rate on the questionnaires. The primary outcome was changes in attitudes regarding counselling patients on a healthy diet. Secondary outcomes included changes in dietary habits and acquisition of culinary knowledge. Average within-person change between timepoints was determined using ordinary least squares fixed-effect models. Statistical significance was defined as P ≤ .05. RESULTS: Participants felt better prepared to counsel patients on a healthy diet immediately post-intervention (coefficient = 2.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 4.0 points; P < .001) and 2 months later (2.2 [1.0, 3.4]; P = .002). Scores on the objective test of culinary knowledge increased immediately after (3.6 [2.4, 4.9]; P < .001) and 2 months after (1.6 [0.4, 2.9]; P = .01) the intervention. Two months post-intervention, participants reported that a higher percentage of their meals were homemade compared to pre-intervention (13.7 [2.1, 25.3]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: An experiential culinary nutrition course may improve medical students' readiness to provide dietary counselling. Further research will be necessary to determine what effects such interventions may have on the quality of participants' own diets.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Promoting sustainable diets through sustainable food choices is essential for achieving the sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. Establishing a practical tool that can measure and score sustainable and healthy eating is highly important. METHODS: We established a 30-item questionnaire to evaluate sustainable-dietary consumption. Based on the literature and a multidisciplinary advisory panel, the questionnaire was computed by principal component analysis, yielding the Sustainable-HEalthy-Diet (SHED) Index. A rigorous multi-stage process included validation in training-verification sets, across recycling efforts, as an indicator of environmental commitment; and validation across the proportion of animal-protein consumption, as an indicator of adherence to a sustainable and healthy dietary-pattern. The EAT-Lancet reference-diet and the Mediterranean-Diet-score were used to investigate the construct validity of the SHED Index score. Reliability was assessed with a test-retest sample. RESULTS: Three-hundred-forty-eight men and women, aged 20-45 years, completed both the SHED Index questionnaire and a validated Food-Frequency-Questionnaire. Increased dietary animal-protein intake was associated with a lower SHED Index total score (p < 0.001). Higher recycling efforts were associated with a higher total SHED Index score (p < 0.001). A linear correlation was found between the SHED Index score and food-groups of the Eat-Lancet-reference diet. A significant correlation was found between the Mediterranean-Diet-score and the SHED Index score (r = 0.575, p < 0.001). The SHED Index score revealed high reliability in test-retest, high validity in training and verification sets, and internal consistency. CONCLUSION: We developed the SHED Index score, a simple, practical tool, for measuring healthy and sustainable individual-diets. The score reflects the nutritional, environmental and sociocultural aspects of sustainable diets; and provides a tangible tool to be used in intervention studies and in daily practice.",

There is an increasing number of studies combining a multiple health behavior change (MHBC) intervention paradigm with eHealth approaches to jointly promote weight-related health behaviors among people with NCD; yet, a comprehensive summary of these studies is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to meta-analyze the effectiveness and systematically summarize the characteristics of the relevant intervention studies for improving the outcomes of physical activity, healthy diet, and weight among people with NCD. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, 4 electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus) were systematically searched to identify eligible articles based on a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Article selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by 2 authors. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for 3 intervention outcomes (physical activity, healthy diet, and weight), and subsequent subgroup analyses were performed for gender, age, intervention duration, channel, and theory. Calculations were conducted, and figures were produced in SPSS 22 and Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Of the 664 original hits generated by the systematic searches, 15 eligible studies with moderate to high quality were included. No potential publication bias was detected using statistical analyses. Studies varied in intervention channel, intensity, and content. The meta-analysis revealed that the eHealth MHBC interventions significantly promoted physical activity (SMD 0.85, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.47, P=.008) and healthy diet (SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.43, P=.02), but did not contribute to a healthy weight status (SMD -0.13, 95% CI= -0.47 to 0.20, P=.43) among people with NCDs, compared to the control conditions. Results from subgroup analysis indicated that theory-based interventions achieved greater effect than nontheory-based interventions in promoting physical activity, and interventions with traditional approaches (SMS, telephone) were more effective than those with modern internet-based approaches in promoting healthy diet. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review indicates that eHealth MHBC interventions achieve preliminary success in promoting physical activity and healthy diet behaviors among people with NCD. Future studies could improve the intervention design to achieve better intervention effectiveness.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen participants with SCI were enrolled from an acute inpatient rehabilitation unit and outpatient SCI clinic; ten participants completed the intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Six tele-nutrition counseling sessions over 3 months, utilizing videoconferencing and a photographic food diary. OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight, waist circumference, Life Satisfaction Index A (LSIA), Knowledge and Nutrition Evaluation with Supplement on Eating Behavior, and Program Satisfaction Survey (PSS). RESULTS: Ten participants completed both baseline and 3-month follow-up evaluations and were used in this analysis. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline to 3-month follow up in weight, waist circumference, Knowledge and Nutrition Evaluation, and LSIA (P > .48). Using the Supplement on Eating Behavior total score to measure overall changes in healthy food choices, 9 out of 10 participants rated their healthy food choices as improving (P = .008). A post-hoc exploratory itemized analysis on the Supplement on Eating Behavior revealed significant improvements from baseline to 3-month follow-up in participant's self-reported choice of balanced meals (P = .008), reading food labels (P = .031), logging meals (P = .007), and monitoring portions of eating favorite foods (P = .031).

In addition, we assessed participants' feedback of HDLS. HDLS is a randomized pilot intervention that compared the effect of intermittent energy restriction combined with a Mediterranean diet (IER + MED) to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, with matching PA regimens, for reducing visceral adipose tissue area (VAT). METHODS: Analyses included the 59 (98%) participants who completed at least 1 week of HDLS. Dietary and PA adherence scores were collected 8 times across 12 weeks, using a 0-10 scale (0 = not at all, 4 = somewhat, and 10 = following the plan very well). Adherence scores for each participant were averaged and assigned to high and low adherence categories using the group median (7.3 for diet, 7.1 for PA). Mean changes in VAT and weight from baseline to 12 weeks are reported by adherence level, overall and by randomization arm. Participants' feedback at completion and 6 months post-intervention were examined. RESULTS: Mean ± SE, dietary adherence was 6.0 ± 0.2 and 8.2 ± 0.1, for the low and high adherence groups, respectively. For PA adherence, mean scores were 5.9 ± 0.2 and 8.5 ± 0.2, respectively. Compared to participants with low dietary adherence, those with high adherence lost significantly more VAT (22.9 ± 3.7 cm2 vs. 11.7 ± 3.9 cm2 [95% CI, - 22.1 to - 0.3]) and weight at week 12 (5.4 ± 0.8 kg vs. 3.5 ± 0.6 kg [95% CI, - 3.8 to - 0.0]). For PA, compared to participants with low adherence, those with high adherence lost significantly more VAT (22.3 ± 3.7 cm2 vs. 11.6 ± 3.6 cm2 [95% CI, - 20.7 to - 0.8]). Participants' qualitative feedback of HDLS was positive and the most common response, on how to improve the study, was to provide cooking classes. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the use of self-rated adherence as an effective method to monitor dietary and PA compliance and facilitate participant goal setting. Study strategies were found to be effective with promoting compliance to intervention prescriptions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03639350 .

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some American households experience food insecurity, where access to adequate food is limited by lack of money and other resources. As such, we implemented a free 6-month Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program within a large urban safety-net hospital. METHODS: 32 participants completed a baseline and postintervention qualitative evaluation about food-related behaviour 6 months after study completion. Deductive codes were developed based on the key topics addressed in the interviews; inductive codes were identified from analytically reading the transcripts. Transcripts were coded in MAXQDA V.12 (Release 12.3.2). RESULTS: The information collected in the qualitative interviews highlights the many factors that affect dietary habits, including the environmental and individual influences that play a role in food choices people make. Participants expressed very positive sentiments overall about their programme participation. CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted intervention that targets individual behaviour change, enhances nutritional knowledge and skills, and reduces socioeconomic barriers to accessing fresh produce may enhance participant knowledge and self-efficacy around healthy eating. However, socioeconomic factors remain as continual barriers to sustaining healthy eating over the long term. Ongoing efforts that address social determinants of health may be necessary to promote sustainability of behaviour change."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US, and poor diet and lack of physical activity are major factors contributing to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To review the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions to improve diet and physical activity in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through September 2019; literature surveillance through July 24, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of behavioral counseling interventions to help people with elevated blood pressure or lipid levels improve their diet and increase physical activity. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted from studies by one reviewer and checked by a second. Random-effects meta-analysis and qualitative synthesis were used. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cardiovascular events, mortality, subjective well-being, cardiovascular risk factors, diet and physical activity measures (eg, minutes of physical activity, meeting physical activity recommendations), and harms. Interventions were categorized according to estimated contact time as low (≤30 minutes), medium (31-360 minutes), and high (>360 minutes). RESULTS: Ninety-four RCTs were included (N = 52 174). Behavioral counseling interventions involved a median of 6 contact hours and 12 sessions over the course of 12 months and varied in format and dietary recommendations; only 5% addressed physical activity alone. Interventions were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (pooled relative risk, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.87]; 9 RCTs [n = 12 551]; I2 = 0%). Event rates were variable; in the largest trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea [PREDIMED]), 3.6% in the intervention groups experienced a cardiovascular event, compared with 4.4% in the control group. Behavioral counseling interventions were associated with small, statistically significant reductions in continuous measures of blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, fasting glucose levels, and adiposity at 12 to 24 months' follow-up. Measurement of diet and physical activity was heterogeneous, and evidence suggested small improvements in diet consistent with the intervention recommendation targets but mixed findings and a more limited evidence base for physical activity. Adverse events were rare, with generally no group differences in serious adverse events, any adverse events, hospitalizations, musculoskeletal injuries, or withdrawals due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Medium- and high-contact multisession behavioral counseling interventions to improve diet and increase physical activity for people with elevated blood pressure and lipid levels were effective in reducing cardiovascular events, blood pressure, low-density lipoproteins, and adiposity-related outcomes, with little to no risk of serious harm.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is still a major health problem in many countries, including Sweden. Childhood obesity and obesity-related behaviours in childhood, such as low physical activity and unhealthy eating habits, tend to track into adulthood, which highlights the need for early prevention. Our aims are to evaluate whether a parent-oriented mobile health app (the MINISTOP 2.0 app) integrated into primary child health care can improve diet and physical activity behaviours and reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity in preschool-aged children as well as to evaluate the implementation among child health care nurses and parents. METHODS: This trial uses a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design. Families (n = 500) who attend a routine visit to one of 15-20 primary child health care centres throughout Sweden, when their child is 2.5 years, are offered participation in a randomised controlled trial (effectiveness evaluation). After acceptance, families will be randomised (1:1) to control or intervention groups. The intervention group receives a 6-month parent-oriented smartphone intervention aimed at improving the dietary and activity behaviours of their child (the MINISTOP 2.0 app) and the control group receives routine child health care. Dietary habits, physical activity and screen time (primary outcomes), body weight and height in children, and parental self-efficacy (secondary outcomes) are measured at baseline and at 6 months post randomisation. Implementation outcomes (i.e. perceived acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility) of the intervention will be assessed among primary child health care nurses and parents in the trial through questionnaires and qualitative interviews. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate whether the MINISTOP 2.0 app can be used in primary child health care to improve diet and physical activity behaviours, and prevent overweight and obesity, in preschool-aged children. If effectiveness is proven, and the MINISTOP 2.0 app is considered acceptable, appropriate and feasible, it can be implemented nationally as part of the preventive strategies to combat childhood obesity provided by routine child health care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the Clinicaltrials.gov register platform (ID NCT04147039 ) on 31 October 2019.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. METHODS: We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. RESULTS: Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. CONCLUSIONS: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.",

      "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by a progressive decline in muscle mass and an increase in fat mass, which are detrimental changes associated with the development of health conditions such as type-2 diabetes mellitus or chronic low-grade inflammation. Although both exercise as well as nutritional interventions are known to be beneficial in counteracting those age-related changes, data to which extent untrained elderly people may benefit is still sparse. Therefore, a randomized, controlled, 12-week interventional trial was conducted in which 134 healthy untrained participants (96 women and 38 men, age 59.4 ± 5.6 years, body mass index (BMI) 28.4 ± 5.8 kg/m2) were allocated to one of four study groups: (1) control group with no intervention (CON); (2) 2×/week aerobic and resistance training only (EX); (3) exercise routine combined with dietary counseling in accordance with the guidelines of the German Nutrition Society (EXDC); (4) exercise routine combined with intake of 2 g/day oil from Calanus finmarchicus (EXCO). Body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis), as well as markers of glucose metabolism and blood lipids, were analyzed at the beginning and the end of the study. The highest decreases in body fat were observed within the EXCO group (-1.70 ± 2.45 kg, p < 0.001), and the EXDC (-1.41 ± 2.13 kg, p = 0.008) group. Markers of glucose metabolism and blood lipids remained unchanged in all groups. Taken together results of this pilot study suggest that a combination of moderate exercise and intake of oil from Calanus finmarchicus or a healthy diet may promote fat loss in elderly untrained overweight participants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Food may trigger Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Therefore, an elimination diet (ED) might be an effective treatment for children with ADHD. However, earlier studies were criticized for the nature of the control group, potential confounders explaining the observed effects, unsatisfactory blinding, potential risks of nutritional deficiencies and unknown long term and cost-effectiveness. To address these issues, this paper describes the rationale, study design and methods of an ongoing two arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the short (5 week) and long term (1 year) effects of an elimination diet and a healthy diet compared with care as usual (CAU) in children with ADHD. METHODS: A total of N = 162 children (5-12 years) with ADHD will be randomized to either an ED or a healthy diet. A comparator arm including N = 60 children being solely treated with CAU (e.g. medication) is used to compare the effects found in both dietary groups. The two armed RCT is performed in two youth psychiatry centers in the Netherlands, with randomization within each participating center. The primary outcome measure is response to treatment defined as a ≥ 30% reduction on an ADHD DSM-5 rating scale (SWAN) and/or on an emotion dysregulation rating scale (SDQ: dysregulation profile). This is assessed after 5 weeks of dietary treatment, after which participants continue the diet or not. Secondary outcome measures include the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observational Schedule (DB-DOS), parent and teacher ratings of comorbid symptoms, cognitive assessment (e.g. executive functions), school functioning, physical measurements (e.g. weight), motor activity, sleep pattern, food consumption, nutritional quality of the diet, adherence, parental wellbeing, use of health care resources and cost-effectiveness. Assessments take place at the start of the study (T0), after five weeks (T1), four months (T2), eight months (T3) and 12 months of treatment (T4). T0, T1 and T4 assessments take place at one of the psychiatric centers. T2 and T3 assessments consist of filling out online questionnaires by the parents only. DISCUSSION: This RCT will likely contribute significantly to clinical practice for ADHD by offering insight into the feasibility, nutritional quality, (cost-)effectiveness and long term effects of dietary treatments for ADHD.

      "abstract": "Objectives: Smartphone applications (\"apps\") can be used to promote health behavior change and expand the reach of behavioral interventions. To date, only a few existing apps have been developed for health promotion among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. To address this gap, we developed an app-based intervention, using game design characteristics, theory-based behavioral strategies, and assistance from a health coach to motivate health behavior change for adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. This article describes the development and initial feasibility evaluation of the intervention. Methods: Using a theoretical framework and an extensive formative process, we developed an app-based game (\"Mila Blooms\") that promotes healthy eating and physical activity among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. A single-arm 8-week intervention, using this app-based game, with assistance from a health coach, was conducted among a sample of pediatric cancer survivors (n = 15) to evaluate its initial feasibility for promoting health behavior change. Results: Results from the feasibility evaluation were encouraging. The majority of enrolled participants were retained throughout the 8-week intervention (93.8%). Participant satisfaction feedback indicated positive experiences, related to ease of use and enjoyment of the app. Although there was little evidence for behavior change attributable to the app in this first stage of development, there was a solid demonstration of the viability and appeal of the game features, and there were no adverse side effects. Conclusions: Results provide insights into how gamification can be used to promote health behaviors through an app-based intervention. Mila Blooms holds promise for promoting health behavior change. Lessons learned from our experiences could be useful for the future development and implementation of app-based adolescent health interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to present the development of the Feel4Diabetes Healthy Diet Score and to evaluate its clinical validity. METHODS: Study population consisted of 3268 adults (63% women) from high diabetes risk families living in 6 European countries. Participants filled in questionnaires at baseline and after 1 year, reflecting the dietary goals of the Feel4Diabetes intervention. Based on these questions the Healthy Diet Score was constructed, consisting of the following components: breakfast, vegetables, fruit and berries, sugary drinks, whole-grain cereals, nuts and seeds, low-fat dairy products, oils and fats, red meat, sweet snacks, salty snacks, and family meals. Maximum score for each component was set based on its estimated relative importance regarding T2DM risk, higher score indicating better quality of diet. Clinical measurements included height, weight, waist circumference, heart rate, blood pressure, and fasting blood sampling, with analyses of glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. Analysis of (co) variance was used to compare the Healthy Diet Score and its components between countries and sexes using baseline data, and to test differences in clinical characteristics between score categories, adjusted for age, sex and country. Pearson's correlations were used to study the association between changes from baseline to year 1 in the Healthy Diet Score and clinical markers. To estimate reproducibility, Pearson's correlations were studied between baseline and 1 year score, within the control group only. RESULTS: The mean total score was 52.8 ± 12.8 among women and 46.6 ± 12.8 among men (p <  0.001). The total score and its components differed between countries. The change in the Healthy Diet Score was significantly correlated with changes in BMI, waist circumference, and total and LDL cholesterol. The Healthy Diet Score as well as its components at baseline were significantly correlated with the values at year 1, in the control group participants. CONCLUSION: The Feel4Diabetes Healthy Diet Score is a reproducible method to capture the dietary information collected with the Feel4Diabetes questionnaire and measure the level of and changes in the adherence to the dietary goals of the intervention. It gives a simple parameter that associates with clinical risk factors in a meaningful manner. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02393872. Registered March 20, 2015.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Healthy dietary patterns and physical activity (PA) represent important lifestyle behaviors with considerable potential to influence on age-related metabolic health. Yet, data on the combined effects of these lifestyle behaviors on metabolic health including low-grade systemic inflammation in aging populations remain scarce. Therefore, this protocol describes a randomized controlled trial aiming to examine the impacts of healthy dietary patterns alone or combined with PA on metabolic health in middle-aged and older men and women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The ORUDIET study is a 3-arm randomized controlled 16-week trial: Healthy Diet (HD), Healthy diet plus PA (HD-PA), and control (CON). The trial is open label, randomized with allocation concealment, parallel groups with passive controls. Participants without overt disease aged between 55 and 70 years, with BMI below 35, a current intake of a maximum of 1 serving of fruit and vegetable per day, and noncompliance to PA guidelines are eligible for inclusion. Participants in HD are instructed to increase fruit and vegetable intake to 5 servings per day (equivalent to 500 g). Participants in HD-PA receive the same dietary intervention as the HD and are additionally instructed to engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activities for at least 150 minutes per week. The primary study outcomes are changes in metabolic and inflammatory health biomarkers. Secondary outcomes are changes in body composition and perceived health. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the ethical review board in Uppsala, Sweden. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated in national and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04062682 Pre-results.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This proposed study aims to translate the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension with Sodium (Na) Reduction for Chinese Canadians (DASHNa-CC), a classroom-based, antihypertensive, dietary educational intervention, to an innovative smartphone app (mDASHNa-CC). This study will enable Chinese Canadian seniors to access antihypertensive dietary interventions anytime, regardless of where they are. It is hypothesized that senior Chinese Canadians will be satisfied with their experiences using the mDASHNa-CC app and that the use of this app could lead to a decrease in their blood pressure and improvement in their health-related quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to design and test the usability and feasibility of a smartphone-based dietary educational app to support a healthy diet and hypertension control for Chinese Canadian seniors. METHODS: A mixed-method two-phase design will be used. The study will be conducted in a Chinese immigrant community in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Chinese Canadian seniors, who are at least 65 years old, self-identified as Chinese, living in Canada, and with elevated blood pressure, will be recruited. In Phase I, we will design and test the usability of the app using a user-centered approach. In Phase II, we will test the feasibility of the app, including implementation (primary outcomes of accrual and attrition rates, technical issues, acceptability of the app, and adherence to the intervention) and preliminary effectiveness (secondary outcomes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, health-related quality of life, and health service utilization), using a pilot, two-group, randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 60 participants in a Chinese Canadian community. RESULTS: The study is supported by the Startup Research Grant from Nipissing University, Canada. The research ethics application is under review by a university research ethics review board. CONCLUSIONS: The study results will make several contributions to the existing literature, including illustrating the rigorous design and testing of smartphone app technology for hypertension self-management in the community, exploring an approach to incorporating traditional medicine into chronic illness management in minority communities and promoting equal access to current technology among minority immigrant senior groups.

      "abstract": "Depression symptoms and lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are associated with inflammation. This multicenter dietary intervention was shown to reduce inflammation in older people. This was the main outcome. Here, we describe the effects on HRQoL, anxiety, and depressive symptoms according to inflammation status. Overall, 125 healthy older subjects (65-80 year) were recruited (Italy, France, and Germany) and randomized into four arms (A, Healthy diet (HD); B, HD plus De Simone Formulation probiotic blend; C, HD plus AISA d-Limonene; D, HD plus Argan oil). The HD was weight maintaining, rich in antioxidant vitamins, polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids (n6: n3 ratio = 3:1), and fiber. Data on inflammatory parameters, mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component summaries of HRQoL (SF-36), anxiety symptoms (STAI state), and depressive symptoms (CES-D) were collected before and after 56 days of intervention. Body fat mass proportion (BFM) was considered a co-variable. A decrease of CES-D score was seen in the four arms (A: -40.0%, p = 0.001; B: -32.5%, p = 0.023; C: -42.8%, p = 0.004; and D: -33.3%, p = 0.21). Within the subgroups of subjects with medium/high inflammation a similar decrease in CES-D score occurred in all groups (A: -44.8%, p = 0.021; B, -46.7%, p = 0.024; C, -52.2%, p = 0.039; D, -43.8%, p = 0.037). The effect of interventions on CES-D was not related to baseline inflammation. MCS-HRQoL improved in A and C. There was no change in anxiety or PCS-HRQoL. In this trial with no control group, a decrease in depressive symptoms in healthy older volunteers was observed after a 2-month healthy diet intervention, independently of inflammation but with possible limitations due to participation.",

      "abstract": "The definition of what constitutes a healthy diet is continually shifting to reflect the evolving understanding of the roles that different foods, essential nutrients, and other food components play in health and disease. A large and growing body of evidence supports that intake of certain types of nutrients, specific food groups, or overarching dietary patterns positively influences health and promotes the prevention of common non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Greater consumption of health-promoting foods and limited intake of unhealthier options are intrinsic to the eating habits of certain regional diets such as the Mediterranean diet or have been constructed as part of dietary patterns designed to reduce disease risk, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets. In comparison with a more traditional Western diet, these healthier alternatives are higher in plant-based foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts and lower in animal-based foods, particularly fatty and processed meats. To better understand the current concept of a \"healthy diet,\" this review describes the features and supporting clinical and epidemiologic data for diets that have been shown to prevent disease and/or positively influence health. In total, evidence from epidemiological studies and clinical trials indicates that these types of dietary patterns reduce risks of NCDs including cardiovascular disease and cancer.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury (SCI) predisposes those who suffer from it to physical inactivity and weight gain; consequently, death due to cardiovascular diseases is more frequent among people with SCI than in the general population. The literature documents a consensus about an interdisciplinary multimodal approach for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors including overweight and obesity in people with SCI, focusing on diet, physical activity (PA) and behavioural interventions. This study will investigate implementation of recommendations from a recent clinical practice guideline for identification and management of cardiometabolic risk after SCI through multimodal patient education in a subacute clinical setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All patients who are aged 18 years or older with an SCI within the previous 12 months and admitted to highly specialised rehabilitation are included, regardless of SCI aetiology or neurological level. A primary study designed as a controlled, pragmatic, preintervention- postintervention study with 6-month follow-up evaluates the effect of the clinical intervention; a prospective national cohort study on body mass index (BMI) serves as a historical control. The intervention consists of a standardised approach to patient education about cardiovascular risk factors, PA and a healthy diet that begins at the outset of primary SCI rehabilitation and is integrated into existing settings and workflows. Outcome measures are collected at admission, discharge and 6 months after discharge and include peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) (primary outcome), BMI, body composition, metabolic profile, neurological status, level of functioning, depression, quality of life, objective PA (accelerometry), self-reported PA, self-assessed PA ability, shared decision making, and dietary habits. Test-retest reliability of four VO2peak test protocols are investigated, as is test-retest reliability of a multisensor accelerometer in a rehabilitation setting. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project is approved by the Committees on Health Research Ethics in the Capital Region of Denmark on 10 July 2018 (Journal-nr.: H-18018325). The principal investigator obtains informed consent from all participants. The interventions in the project are closely related to existing rehabilitation care, and the risk of pain and discomfort is considered modest. Any unintended events related to the elements of the intervention are reported, according to existing regional procedures. Data are stored in a secure web-based database (Redcap). The primary study and prospective cohort study are registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. Positive and negative results will be submitted to relevant scientific journals related to SCI for publication. Important protocol modifications are reported to the Committees on Health Research Ethics in the Capital Region of Denmark. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: NCT03689023 and NCT03369080.",

AIM: The current study was conducted to assess the knowledge of mothers/caregivers towards a healthy, safe, and affordable diet and to cover the detected knowledge gap using a community-based approach. METHODS: A pre-posttest experimental design was carried out at a community level at three Upper Egypt governorates: Assiut, Qena, and Sohag over six months from September 2017 till February 2018. In the preparatory phase, 22 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were selected per governorate, and 15 trainers were prepared at the central level to train 40 trainees from each governorate. In the implementation phase, 11,000 women were approached, 6548 of them agreed to participate in the baseline knowledge assessment: 1774 women from Assiut, 2337 from Qena, and 2437 from Sohag. RESULTS: A significant improvement in the participants' subtotal and total knowledge scores in all dimensions of nutrition education which are: food economics, food safety, and a healthy diet. The highest percent change was in Assiut 77.1 (69.3: 109.9), followed by Qena 54.9 (27.2: 93.3), and then Sohag 43.7 (31.6: 61.4) which was noticed among the participants from the 3 governorates. CONCLUSION: This community-based approach was a successful intervention to deliver effective health education messages; thus, improving participants' knowledge regarding food safety, healthy diet, and food economics. It represented the success of NGOs to enhance health and nutrition literacy among the participating women living in underprivileged areas. It is recommended to encourage collaboration with NGOs to move the community towards healthy behaviours."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality of coronary heart disease can be largely reduced by modifying unhealthy lifestyles. However, the long-term effectiveness of interventions for modifying unhealthy diet and physical inactivity of patients with coronary heart disease remain unsatisfactory worldwide. This study aims to systematically design a set of theory-based and evidence-based, individualized, and intelligent interventions for promoting the adoption and maintenance of a healthy diet and physical activity level in patients with coronary heart disease. METHODS: The interventions will be delivered by a mobile health care system called Individualized, Intelligent and Integrated Cardiovascular Application for Risk Elimination. Three steps of the intervention mapping framework were used to systematically develop the interventions. Step 1: needs assessment, which was carried out by a literature review, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Step 2: development of objective matrix for diet and physical activity changes, based on the intersection of objectives and determinants from the Contemplation-Action-Maintenance behavior change model. Step 3: formulation of evidence-based methods and strategies, and practical applications, through a systematic review of existing literature, research team discussions, and consultation with multidisciplinary expert panels. RESULTS: Three needs relevant to content of the intervention, one need relevant to presentation modes of the intervention, and four needs relevant to functional features of the application were identified. The objective matrix includes three performance objectives, and 24 proximal performance objectives. The evidence-based and theory-based interventions include 31 strategies, 61 evidence-based methods, and 393 practical applications. CONCLUSIONS: This article describes the development of theory-based and evidence-based interventions of the mobile health care system for promoting the adoption and maintenance of a healthy diet and physical activity level in a structured format. The results will provide a theoretical and methodological basis to explore the application of intervention mapping in developing effective behavioral mobile health interventions for patients with coronary heart disease.

We examined the associations of the diet quality of patients who have colorectal cancer with the characteristics of the patients and their families, the patient's perceived barriers to following the diet, and the family's attempts to change the diet. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was employed. Patients with colorectal cancer were recruited from National University Hospitals in South Korea. Enrolled patients were over 19 years old. Enrolled relatives served as the primary caregivers of the patients. METHODS: A total of 216 patients who had colorectal cancer and their family caregivers were enrolled. We assessed patients' diet quality, their perceived barriers to following the dietary plan, and family caregivers' attempts to improve diet quality. FINDINGS: Patients with colorectal cancer were less likely to have healthy eating habits if they perceived barriers to the recommended dietary plan, and more likely to have healthy eating habits if they had family caregivers who attempted to change their own dietary habits. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies that target patients' perceived barriers to following a healthy diet and that encourage family members to facilitate the adoption of a healthy diet can be integrated into the treatment plan of patients with colorectal cancer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results can be used as evidence for promoting the notion that diet interventions for patients with colorectal cancer focus on the patient-family dyad, which support overall quality of care in oncology care hospitals.",

The objective of the study was to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation and impact evaluation of projects oriented to promote physical activity and healthy diet at community level. We analyzed experiences of the projects implemented within the Healthy Municipalities and Communities Program (HMCP) in Argentina. Methods: A mixed methods approach included (1) in-depth semi-structured interviews, with 44 stakeholders; and (2) electronic survey completed by 206 individuals from 96 municipalities across the country. Results: The most important barriers included the lack of: adequate funding (43%); skilled personnel (42%); equipment and material resources (31%); technical support for data management and analysis (20%); training on project designs (12%); political support from local authorities (17%) and acceptance of the proposed intervention by the local community (9%). Facilitators included motivated local leaders, inter-sectorial participation and seizing local resources. Project evaluation was mostly based on process rather than outcome indicators. Conclusions: This study contributes to a better understanding of the difficulties in the implementation of community-based intervention projects. Findings may guide stakeholders on how to facilitate local initiatives. There is a need to improve project evaluation strategies by incorporating process, outcome and context specific indicators.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: The effect of a lifestyle intervention to reduce liver fat content in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in humans is influenced by genetics. We hypothesized that the amino acid exchange in human Gly388Arg (mouse homolog: Gly385Arg) in fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), which regulates bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism, could determine hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin sensitivity. Mechanisms of this substitution were studied in mice under normal chow and high-fat diets. DESIGN: In humans, the Gly388Arg polymorphism was studied for its relationship with changes in liver fat content and insulin sensitivity during 9 months of a lifestyle intervention. We also studied a knock-in mouse strain with an Arg385 allele introduced into the murine FGFR4 gene under normal chow and high-fat diets. RESULTS: In humans, the FGFR4 Arg388 allele was not associated with liver fat content or insulin sensitivity in subjects who were overweight and obese before lifestyle intervention. However, it was associated with less decrease in liver fat content and less increase in insulin sensitivity during the intervention. In mice receiving normal chow, the FGFR4 Arg385 allele was associated with elevated hepatic triglyceride content, altered hepatic lipid composition, and increased hepatic expression of genes inducing de novo lipogenesis and glycolysis. Body fat mass and distribution, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity were unaltered. The FGFR4 Arg385 allele had no effect on glucose or lipid metabolism under the high-fat diet. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the FGFR4 Arg388(385) allele affects hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism specifically during healthy caloric intake.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Beyond the well-known effects on blood pressure (BP) of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) and the Mediterranean diets associated to a correct lifestyle, often a lifestyle change is not simple and can show only long-time results: in this sense, a possible support might be derived from the use of some anti-hypertensive supplements or nutraceuticals, which may provide a significant reduction in blood pressure. AIM: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in a group of 36 pre-hypertensive and first-degree hypertensive patients. METHODS: The treatment period with a mix of bioactive substances (BPLN®, containing a donor of nitric oxide, magnesium, and vitamins) or placebo was 16-week long and was preceded by 4 weeks of diet stabilization. RESULTS: At the end of the intervention, patients treated with the nutraceutical product showed a significant reduction of all morning pressure parameters and of evening systolic blood pressure, both versus the baseline and versus the group treated with placebo. These effects were maintained even after the first 16 weeks of treatment, confirming that the preliminary results were not due to simple changes in volume and do not lead to adaptation/tachyphylaxis. No patient complained of any side effects while taking the active treatment and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The tested nutraceutical composite reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the medium term, leading to a significant reduction in the estimated cardiovascular risk in a sample of patients with pre-hypertension or first-degree hypertension.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health behaviors among low-income groups have become a major issue in the context of increasing social inequalities. The low-income population is less likely to be receptive to nutritional recommendations, but providing cooking advice could be more effective. In this domain, taking advantage of digital devices can be a bonus with its own challenges. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and deploy NutCracker, a social network-based cooking app for low-income population, including cooking tips and nutritional advices, aiming at creating small online communities. We further determined the usefulness, perceptions, barriers, and motivators to use NutCracker. METHODS: The smartphone app, designed jointly with beneficiaries of the social emergency services, was implemented in a disadvantaged neighborhood of Magny, (Paris region, France). Once the app became available, 28 subjects, living in the neighborhood, tested the app for a 6-month period. Logs to the app and usages were collected by the software. In total, 12 in-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted among the users and the social workers to analyze their uses and perceptions of the app relative to their interest in cooking, cooking skills, socioeconomic constraints, and social integration. These interviews were compared with 21 supplementary interviews conducted among low-income individuals in the general population. RESULTS: NutCracker was developed as a social network-based app, and it includes cooking tips, nutritional advice, and Web-based quizzes. We identified barriers to uses (especially technical barriers, lack of knowledge in the field of new technologies and written comprehension, and search for real contacts) and motivators (in particular, good social integration, previous use of social networks, and help of children as intermediaries). Cooking skills were both a barrier and a lever. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting the low-income groups through a cooking app to promote healthier behaviors offers many advantages but has not been fully explored. However, the barriers in low-income milieu remain high, especially among the less socially integrated strata. Lessons from this intervention allow us to identify barriers and possible levers to improve nutrition promotion and awareness in deprived areas, especially in the time of social crisis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk begins in utero in offspring of obese mothers. A critical unmet need in this field is to understand the pathways and biomarkers underlying fetal hepatic lipotoxicity and whether maternal dietary intervention during pregnancy is an effective countermeasure. METHODS: We utilized a well-established non-human primate model of chronic, maternal, Western-style diet induced obesity (OB-WSD) compared with mothers on a healthy control diet (CON) or a subset of OB-WSD mothers switched to the CON diet (diet reversal; OB-DR) prior to and for the duration of the next pregnancy. Fetuses were studied in the early 3rd trimester. RESULTS: Fetuses from OB-WSD mothers had higher circulating triglycerides (TGs) and lower arterial oxygenation suggesting hypoxemia, compared with fetuses from CON and OB-DR mothers. Hepatic TG content, oxidative stress (TBARs), and de novo lipogenic genes were increased in fetuses from OB-WSD compared with CON mothers. Fetuses from OB-DR mothers had lower lipogenic gene expression and TBARs yet persistently higher TGs. Metabolomic profiling of fetal liver and serum (umbilical artery) revealed distinct separation of CON and OB-WSD groups, and an intermediate phenotype in fetuses from OB-DR mothers. Pathway analysis identified decreased tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, increased amino acid (AA) metabolism and byproducts, and increased gluconeogenesis, suggesting an increased reliance on AA metabolism to meet energy needs in the liver of fetuses from OB-WSD mothers. Components in collagen synthesis, including serum protein 5-hydroxylysine and hepatic lysine and proline, were positively correlated with hepatic TGs and TBARs, suggesting early signs of fibrosis in livers from the OB-WSD group. Importantly, hepatic gluconeogenic and arginine related intermediates and serum levels of lactate, pyruvate, several AAs, and nucleotide intermediates were normalized in the OB-DR group. However, hepatic levels of CDP-choline and total ceramide levels remained high in fetuses from OB-DR mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide new metabolic evidence that, in addition to fetal hepatic steatosis, maternal WSD creates fetal hypoxemia and increases utilization of AAs for energy production and early activation of gluconeogenic pathways in the fetal liver. When combined with hyperlipidemia and limited antioxidant activity, the fetus suffers from hepatic oxidative stress and altered intracellular metabolism which can be improved with maternal diet intervention. Our data reinforce the concept that multiple \"first hits\" occur in the fetus prior to development of obesity and demonstrate new biomarkers with potential clinical implications for monitoring NAFLD risk in offspring.",
