      "abstract": "Sarcopenia negatively affects the quality of life and health of older individuals. Physical exercise is a standard treatment for sarcopenia. Recently, the potential benefits of green tea catechins (GTCs) in sarcopenia have gained considerable attention. In this study, we investigated the effects of a combination of GTCs and physical exercise on the symptoms and pathologies of sarcopenia using male senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8). These mice were divided into four groups: control, GTCs, exercise (Ex), and GTCs + Ex. GTC-fed mice were fed a diet containing 0.33 % GTCs. The mice were subjected to exercise training (voluntary wheel running) for 12 weeks, from 5 to 8 months of age, and grip strength and gastrocnemius muscle alterations were investigated. SAMP8 mice exhibited symptoms and pathologies of sarcopenia, including loss of muscle mass, decreased grip strength, reduced mitochondrial capacity, increased oxidative stress, reduced number of satellite cells, and an increased ratio of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive nuclei located within the muscle cells in the aged muscle. The GTCs and/or Ex groups showed improved symptoms and pathologies of sarcopenia. In addition, the GTCs + Ex group exhibited enhanced mitochondrial capacity, myogenic differentiation, and maturation in aged skeletal muscle than that observed in the GTCs group. Our findings suggested that GTCs and/or Ex are effective in ameliorating several age-related changes in muscle morphology and function. Notably, GTCs intake, together with habitual exercise, may enhance the beneficial effects on the symptoms and pathologies of sarcopenia in aged muscle.",

The efficacy of ad libitum dosing was assessed by analyzing the bioaccumulation of tea catechins in urine samples collected from metabolic cages on days 0, 30, 60, and 90, using LC/Q-TOF analysis. PD-related behavioral impairments were measured with open field and rotarod performance tests on days 0, 45, and 90. On day 90, plasma α-synuclein levels were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess treatment effects.Results: Circulating tea catechin metabolites were detected in treated groups by day 30, with levels progressively increasing through day 90. By day 90, control mice exhibited significant deficits in rotarod performance, while both low- and high-dose groups maintained or improved their maximum time on the rotarod. Open field testing indicated reduced anxiety-related behavior in control mice compared to treated groups. ELISA analysis revealed significantly lower circulating α-synuclein levels in high-dose mice compared to controls.Conclusion: Our findings indicate that sustained administration of tea catechins significantly reduces circulating α-synuclein levels in blood plasma, improves motor coordination in a dose-dependent manner, and modulates anxiety-related behaviors in a PD mouse model."

Although vaccination and medications (such as neuraminidase inhibitors) are the mainstay of pharmacological approaches to prevent and treat influenza, however, frequent mutations in the influenza genome often result in treatment failure and resistance to standard medications which limit their effectiveness. In recent years, green tea catechins have been evaluated as potential anti-influenza agents. Herein, in this review, we highlighted the effects and mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant ingredient in green tea, against different influenza viral infections, and their clinical benefits toward prevention and treatment. In addition, as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) causes the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, our review also delineates the current perspective on SARS-CoV-2 and future insights as to the potential application of EGCG on suppressing the flu-like symptoms caused by COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We encountered a urine sample suspected of being mixed with tea, submitted by a suspect attempting to camouflage illegal drugs. Although urine should turn reddish-pink during a urea test with p-Dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DAC), this suspect's sample exhibited a blue coloration when tested with DAC. AIM: Our aim was to examine the influence and mechanism of green tea on various urine identification tests. RESULTS: Our examination revealed that DAC forms a compound with the urea in urine, resulting in a reddish pink coloration with a molecular weight of 217. However, it has been reported that DAC binds to polyphenols such as catechin. In the case of catechin, DAC binds to the C8 position, forming a compound that exhibits the highest absorption at 640 nm and appears blue. we investigated the effect of urine from volunteers who had consumed a large amount of catechin on the urea test with DAC. Additionally, we carried out quantitative analysis of catechin in urine by LC-MS/MS after enzymatic treatment with β-glucuronidase. The concentration of urinary excreted catechin reached its peak approximately 3 to 4 h after ingestion. During the DAC test, urine samples collected 3 to 4 h after catechin ingestion displayed a bluish pink color, but not the blue color observed in the original suspect sample. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the impact of catechin on urine tests, revealing that a blue color in the DAC test indicates a high likelihood of camouflage by the suspect.",

      "abstract": "Green tea catechins are bioactive polyphenol compounds which have attracted significant attention for their diverse biological activities and potential health benefits. Notably, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has emerged as a potent apoptosis inducer through mechanisms involving caspase activation, modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, disruption of survival signaling pathways and by regulating the redox balance, inducing oxidative stress. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that green tea catechins can modulate epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. In addition to their apoptotic actions, ROS signaling effects and reversal of epigenetic alterations, green tea catechins have shown promising results in promoting the differentiation of leukemia cells. This review highlights the comprehensive actions of green tea catechins and provides valuable insights from clinical trials investigating the therapeutic potential of green tea catechins in leukemia treatment. Understanding these multifaceted mechanisms and the outcomes of clinical trials may pave the way for the development of innovative strategies and the integration of green tea catechins into clinical practice for improving leukemia patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and visual impairment, affecting more than 80 million individuals worldwide. Oxidative stress and inflammation-induced neurodegenerative insults to retinal ganglion cells are the main pathogenesis of glaucoma. Retinal ganglion cells, the retinal neurons transmitting the visual signals to the visual cortex in the brain, have very limited regeneration or recovery capacity after damages. Apart from intraocular pressure-lowering treatments, there is still no clinically effective treatment to rescue the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma. Dietary antioxidants are easily accessible and can be applied as supplements assisting in the clinical treatments. Catechins, a chemical family of flavonoids, are the phenolic compounds found in many plants, especially in green tea. The anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of green tea catechins in vitro and in vivo have been well proven. They could be a potential treatment ameliorating retinal ganglion cell degeneration in glaucoma. In this review, the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic properties of green tea catechins were summarized. Research updates on the biological effects of green tea catechins in cellular and animal experimental glaucoma models were reviewed. In addition, clinical potentials of green tea catechins for glaucoma treatment were also highlighted."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation of tooth-supporting tissue and the pulp tissue is followed by wound healing and regeneration process that involves the specific type of connective tissue cells, the fibroblasts. During periodontitis and pulpitis, the inflammation of the tissue causes damage to the fibroblasts. These fibroblasts secrete collagen proteins and maintain the structural framework; along with this the inflammatory process moves toward healing where in the specific cells such as the fibroblast cells play important roles. Green tea catechins epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) being one of the major catechins is known to have multiple beneficial effects on human fibroblasts. OBJECTIVE: To assess the in vitro cytotoxicity of green tea catechins on the human periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts and human dental pulp fibroblasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human PDL fibroblasts (hPDLFs) and human dental pulp fibroblasts were isolated from the two extracted premolar teeth that were indicated for orthodontic treatment. The fibroblasts were then seeded in 96 well tissue culture plate for cell viability study. EGCG was used at different concentration to treat the cells. After 48 h; (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) (MTT) assay was performed to determine the cell viability. RESULTS: The vitality of hPDLFs and human dental pulp fibroblasts was found to be inversely proportional to EGCG concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: hPDLFs have shown 37% proliferation at lowest concentration of EGCG used and human dental pulp fibroblasts have shown 99% viability at lowest concentration of EGCG used."

Using monosodium-glutamate-induced obesity mice, the present study investigated the synergistic obesity-reducing effects of tea catechins and the antioxidant β-cryptoxanthin present in mandarin oranges. The results show that the obese mice that ingested both tea catechin and β-cryptoxanthin for 4 weeks had a significantly decreased body weight, with no difference in body weight compared with control mice. Moreover, the blood biochemical test results were normal, and the body fat percentage was significantly decreased according to the histopathological analysis. Additionally, the abundance of M1 macrophages, which release pro-inflammatories, was significantly reduced in adipose tissue. Indeed, a significant decrease was detected in M1-macrophage-secreted tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. Meanwhile, M2 macrophage levels were recovered, and adiponectin, which is released from adipocytes and involved in suppressing metabolic syndrome, was increased. Collectively, these results suggest that the combination of tea catechins and antioxidant foods can alleviate chronic obesity, indicating that a combination of various ingredients in foods might contribute to reducing chronic obesity.",

Cancer remedies have been sought from all possible directions, including chemicals, irradiation, nanomaterials, natural compounds, and the like. In this current review, we surveyed the milestones achieved by green tea catechins and what has been accomplished in cancer therapy. Specifically, we have assessed the synergistic anticarcinogenic effects when green tea catechins (GTCs) are combined with other antioxidant-rich natural compounds. Living in an age of inadequacies, combinatorial approaches are gaining momentum, and GTCs have progressed much, yet there are insufficiencies that can be improvised when combined with natural antioxidant compounds. This review highlights that there are not many reports in this specific area and encourages and recommends research attention in this direction. The antioxidant/prooxidant mechanisms of GTCs have also been highlighted. The current scenario and the future of such combinatorial approaches have been addressed, and the lacunae in this aspect have been discussed.",

Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) has been identified as a therapeutic target in several cancers and plays an important role in inflammatory responses. Many phytochemicals, including catechins, have been reported in the scientific literature with efficient anticancer potential and minimal side effects. This study aims to gain insights into the inhibitory mechanism of catechin derivatives epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) using in silico and in vitro studies especially considering NF-κB targeting. We explored the binding pose, interacting residues and molecular interactions for catechin derivatives with NF-κB. Docking analysis showed that the catechin derivatives acted as covalent inhibitors with the p65 subunit of NF-κB and interacted with other residues through non-bonding interactions and hydrogen bonds. Further, we validated the effect of EGCG on NF-κB activity in pancreatic cancer cell lines MIAPaCa-2 and SU 86.86. Our in vitro data showed EGCG effectively reduced cell growth and proliferation, induced apoptosis, and inhibited NF-κB activity in the studied cell lines. In addition, EGCG repressed the expression of NF-κB target genes including MMP9, MMP2, cMyc, and BCL-2. Thus, targeting NF-κB with EGCG could be a potential therapeutic alternative for pancreatic cancer treatment."

Our previous study showed that low doses of green tea extract enriched in epigallocatechin-3-gallate (GTE-EGCG), administered continuously from embryonic day 9 to postnatal day 29, reduced facial dysmorphologies in the Ts65Dn (TS) mouse model of DS, but high doses could exacerbate them. Here, we extended the analyses to other skeletal structures and systematically evaluated the effects of high and low doses of GTE-EGCG treatment over postnatal development in wild-type (WT) and TS mice using in vivo µCT and geometric morphometrics. TS mice developed shorter and wider faces, skulls, and mandibles, together with shorter and narrower humerus and scapula, and reduced BMD dynamically over time. Besides facial morphology, GTE-EGCG did not rescue any other skeletal phenotype in TS treated mice. In WT mice, GTE-EGCG significantly altered the shape of the skull and mandible, reduced the length and width of the long bones, and lowered the BMD. The disparate effects of GTE-EGCG depended on the dose, developmental timepoint, and anatomical structure analyzed, emphasizing the complex nature of DS and the need to further investigate the simultaneous effects of GTE-EGCG supplementation.",

Unfermented green tea is the finest source of these chemicals. Catechins have the ability to effectively neutralize reactive oxygen species. The catechin derivatives of green tea include epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG has the greatest anti-inflammatory and anticancer potential. Notably, catechins in green tea have been explored for their ability to prevent a variety of cancers. Literature evidence, based on epidemiological and laboratory studies, indicates that green tea catechins have certain properties that can serve as the basis for their consideration as lead molecules in the synthesis of novel anticancer drugs and for further exploration of their role as pharmacologically active natural adjuvants to standard chemotherapeutics. The various sections of the article will focus on how catechins affect the survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of tumors by modulating cellular pathways.",

      "abstract": "Tea catechins are a group of flavonoids that show many bioactivities. Catechins have been extensively reported as a potential treatment for skin disorders, including skin cancers, acne, photoaging, cutaneous wounds, scars, alopecia, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and microbial infection. In particular, there has been an increasing interest in the discovery of cosmetic applications using catechins as the active ingredient because of their antioxidant and anti-aging activities. However, active molecules with limited lipophilicity have difficulty penetrating the skin barrier, resulting in low bioavailability. Nevertheless, topical application is a convenient method for delivering catechins into the skin. Nanomedicine offers an opportunity to improve the delivery efficiency of tea catechins and related compounds. The advantages of catechin-loaded nanocarriers for topical application include high catechin loading efficiency, sustained or prolonged release, increased catechin stability, improved bioavailability, and enhanced accumulation or targeting to the nidus. Further, various types of nanoparticles, including liposomes, niosomes, micelles, lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, liquid crystalline nanoparticles, and nanocrystals, have been employed for topical catechin delivery. These nanoparticles can improve catechin permeation via close skin contact, increased skin hydration, skin structure disorganization, and follicular uptake. In this review, we describe the catechin skin delivery approaches based on nanomedicine for treating skin disorders. We also provide an in-depth description of how nanoparticles effectively improve the skin absorption of tea catechins and related compounds, such as caffeine. Furthermore, we summarize the possible future applications and the limitations of nanocarriers for topical delivery at the end of this review article.",

Cytosolic Ca2+ elevation plays a crucial role in ABA-induced stomatal closure during drought stress; however, to what extent the Ca2+ movement across the plasma membrane from the apoplast to the cytosol contributes to this process still needs clarification. Here the authors identify (-)-catechin gallate (CG) and (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), components of green tea, as inhibitors of voltage-dependent K+ channels which regulate K+ fluxes in Arabidopsis thaliana guard cells. In Arabidopsis guard cells CG/GCG prevent ABA-induced: i) membrane depolarization; ii) activation of Ca2+ permeable cation (ICa ) channels; and iii) cytosolic Ca2+ transients. In whole Arabidopsis plants co-treatment with CG/GCG and ABA suppressed ABA-induced stomatal closure and surface temperature increase. Similar to ABA, CG/GCG inhibited stomatal closure is elicited by the elicitor peptide, flg22 but has no impact on dark-induced stomatal closure or light- and fusicoccin-induced stomatal opening, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of CG/GCG is associated with Ca2+ -related signaling pathways. This study further supports the crucial role of ICa channels of the plasma membrane in ABA-induced stomatal closure. Moreover, CG and GCG represent a new tool for the study of abiotic or biotic stress-induced signal transduction pathways.",

This systematic review surveyed the effects of EGCG or green tea extract (GTE) on NAFLD reported in studies involving rodent models or humans with a focus on clinicopathologic outcomes, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammatory, oxidative stress, and liver injury markers. Articles involving clinical efficacy of EGCG/GTE on human subjects and rodent models were gathered by searching the PUBMED database and by referencing additional articles identified from other literature reviews. EGCG or GTE supplementation reduced body weight, adipose tissue deposits, and food intake. Mechanistically, the majority of these studies confirmed that EGCG or GTE supplementation plays a significant role in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism and expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. Importantly, EGCG and GTE supplementation were shown to have beneficial effects on oxidative stress-related pathways that activate pro-inflammatory responses, leading to liver damage. In conclusion, green tea catechins are a potentially useful treatment option for NAFLD. More research is required to determine the ideal dosage, treatment duration, and most effective delivery method of EGCG or GTE, and to provide more definitive conclusions by performing large, randomized clinical trials."

Polyphenols (tea catechins) are an ideal option as alternative chemotherapeutics owing to their inherent anticancer properties, antioxidant properties and being naturally occurring compounds, are deemed safe for consumption. However, without proper administration, the bioavailability of these compounds is low and inefficient. Therefore, proper delivery of these phenolic compounds is vital for cancer therapy. Herein, we analyzed three potential solutions to creating nanoparticle drugs using naturally occurring phenolic compounds (piceatannol (PIC), epigallocatechin gallate hydrophilic (EGCG) and l-epicatechin (EPI)). By using a simple pi-pi stacking mechanism, we utilized boronated PEG (PEG-Br) as an anchor to efficiently load EPI, PIC and EGCG, respectively, to produce three effective phenolic compound-based nanoparticles, which could be delivered safely in systemic circulation, yet detach from its cargo intracellularly to exert its anticancer effect for effective cancer therapy."

For the in vitro experiment, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were extracted from demineralized human coronary dentin powder (citric acid, pH 2.3) and assessed via a colorimetric assay and electrophoresis in gelatin. The gels were exposed to buffers with: control (no treatment), 0.05% sodium fluoride (NaF), 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX), GT infusion, and 0.1% EGCG, and their respective activity was analyzed by zymography. For the in situ experiment, 20 healthy volunteers (aged 20-32 years) participated in this single-center, blind, crossover study. The subjects wore upper removable devices containing four human dentin blocks. Erosive challenge (coke-1 min) was performed four times/day/5 days. Blocks were treated for 1 min with: control (No treatment), 0.05% NaF, 0.1% EGCG, and GT. Thereafter, the specimens were subjected to stylus profilometry and SEM. ANOVA was used to evaluate dentin roughness and wear, with a significance level of 5%. In the zymography analysis, 0.12% CHX, GT, and 0.1% EGCG were found to inhibit the action of MMPs; however, in the colorimetric assay, only green tea inhibited the activity of MMPs. There were no significant differences observed in dentin roughness or wear (p > 0.05). Herein, EGCG and GT inhibited the activity of endogenous proteases, resulting in protection against erosion-induced dentin damage; however, they could not prevent tooth tissue loss in situ.",

      "abstract": "Pterygium belongs to an ocular surface disease with triangular-shaped hyperplastic growth, characterized by conjunctivalization, inflammation, and connective tissue remodeling. We previously demonstrated neoplastic-like properties of pterygium cells. Green tea catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), has been shown to possess antitumorigenic properties; herein, we aimed to determine the effects of green tea catechins on human primary pterygium cell survival and migration and compared to that on patients' conjunctival cells. Both human primary pterygium and conjunctival cells expressed EGCG receptor, the 67 kDa laminin receptor. Seven-day treatment of green tea extract (Theaphenon E; 16.25 μg/mL) and EGCG (25 μM) attenuated pterygium cell proliferation by 16.78% (p < 0.001) and 24.09% (p < 0.001) respectively, without significantly influencing conjunctival cells. Moreover, green tea extract (16.25 μg/mL) and EGCG (25 μM) treatments also hindered pterygium cell migration by 35.22% (p < 0.001) and 25.20% (p = 0.019), respectively, but not conjunctival cells. Yet, green tea extract and EGCG treatments did not significantly induce pterygium cell apoptosis. Furthermore, green tea extract and EGCG treatments significantly increased the phosphorylation of p38 protein but reduced the phosphorylation of p42/p44 protein in pterygium cells. In summary, this study revealed that green tea extract and EGCG attenuated human primary pterygium cell survival and migration in vitro without damaging conjunctival cells, suggesting a novel potential therapeutic approach for primary pterygium treatment.",

After ingestion, the pharmacokinetic changes in plasma hesperetin (HEP) and catechins were measured. Study 2: 36 healthy male and female subjects (mean age, 53 ± 2 years; mean BMI, 25.2 ± 0.5 kg m-2) were recruited for a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which they ingested a test beverage containing 165 mg GHES with 387 mg GTC or a placebo beverage daily for 4 weeks. Fasting serum TG and other lipids and glucose metabolites were analyzed. Study 1 showed that the pharmacokinetics of HEP did not differ significantly between the 336 mg GHES without GTC treatment and the 168 mg GHES with GTC treatment. Study 2 showed that continuous ingestion of 165 mg GHES and 387 mg GTC for 4 weeks significantly decreased fasting serum TG levels compared with baseline values (change in TG, -30 ± 13 mg dl-1, P = 0.040) in the intention-to-treat analysis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that GTC affects the oral bioavailability of GHES, and combined ingestion of low doses of GHES with GTC effectively improves fasting TG levels.",

Two intervention studies with different test beverages, beverage-C (40 mL, containing 73.4 mg of catechins) and beverage-XT (40 mL, beverage-C containing 100 mg xanthan gum) were conducted in 20 healthy volunteers (mean age 38.7 years). Catechin concentrations were measured in buccal mucosa samples collected at 10 min, 40 min, and 60 min after ingesting test beverages, and the catechin variability of the tissue after intake was compared between test beverages. As a result, the mean (SEM) concentrations of EGCG were 99.9 (27.2), 58.2 (16.6), and 22.3 (5.7) ng/mg-mucosa at 10, 40, and 60 min, respectively, after ingestion of beverage-XT. Similarly, the catechin concentrations were 86.1 (20.3), 32.2 (5.3), and 27.8 (5.9) ng/mg-mucosa after ingestion of beverage-C. The total retention volume over 60 min tended to be slightly higher after ingestion of beverage-XT, though the difference was not statistically significant. Additional studies are needed to confirm the effect of xanthan gum on improving oral retention of catechins.",

To evaluate if tea and tea catechin consumption has the same protective effects as gargling with tea, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Ichu-shi Web databases. The search provided six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four prospective cohort studies (n = 3748). The quality of each trial or study was evaluated according to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool or Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We collected data from publications meeting the search criteria and conducted a meta-analysis of the effect of tea gargling and tea catechin consumption for preventing URTI using a random effects model. RESULTS: Tea gargling and tea catechin consumption had significant preventive effects against URTI (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.87). In sub-analyses, a significant preventive effect was observed by study type (prospective cohort study: RR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; RCT: RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94) and disease type (influenza: RR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.84; acute URTI: RR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98). Both gargling with tea and consuming tea catechins effectively protected against URTI (tea and tea catechins consumption: RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.87; tea gargling: RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that tea gargling and tea catechin consumption may have preventive effects against influenza infection and URTI. The potential effectiveness of these actions as non-pharmaceutical interventions, however, requires further investigation.",

Irinotecan (IRN) is a highly effective chemotherapeutic drug against various types of cancer including colon cancer along with its analogous dose-limiting side effects viz. diarrhea, neutropenia, leucopenia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as major toxicities. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects of GT alone or in combination with IRN in inflammation-associated colon cancer mouse model induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). We also evaluated the effect of GT- on IRN-induced toxicity and histopathological alterations. Animals were divided into six groups (n = 5 per group). After induction of cancer model, animals were treated with GT and/or IRN. We observed the inflammation, tumor progression, and ameliorative effects of GT and IRN alone or in combination. RESULTS: Because of antioxidant potential of GT, IRN-induced toxicity ameliorative effect of GT was also studied in combined treated groups. It was found that co-administration of IRN and GT significantly decreased number of tumors and simultaneously was found to ameliorate diarrhea along with leucopenia and neutropenia. Besides these, mitigation of adenomatous characters and NAFLD was also observed in the IRN- and GT-treated group when analyzed histologically. CONCLUSIONS: GT significantly reduced the toxicity induced by IRN in terms of diarrhea, neutropenia, leucopenia, and NAFLD and works as an effective anticancer agent as it mitigates histopathology of colon adenocarcinoma.",

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: An open-label randomized controlled trial involving 84-healthy older individuals (age ≥65 years) without sarcopenia, diabetes, and kidney disease, was conducted. They were allocated to the exercise (n=28), exercise and essential AA ingestion (n=28), and exercise, essential AA, and TC ingestion groups (n=28). The participants underwent a 24-week program of resistance exercise (performed twice per week) along with essential AA and TC intake (3,000 and 540 mg, respectively). RESULTS: Six participants could not complete the intervention after randomization. After the 24-week intervention period, the exercise, essential AA, and TC ingestion groups showed an increase in the skeletal muscle mass index, one-legged balance test, and physical quality of life score (skeletal muscle mass index, p=0.004; one-legged balance test, p=0.045; physical quality of life, p=0.020). After the 24- week intervention period, the exercise and essential AA ingestion group showed an increase in the skeletal muscle mass index and physical quality of life score (skeletal muscle mass index, p=0.014; physical quality of life, p=0.041). However, the exercise group did not show an increase in the skeletal muscle mass index. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that resistance exercise, essential AA, and TC intake in healthy older people could improve physical performance.",

      "abstract": "Tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide after water, and green tea accounts for 20% of the total tea consumption. The health benefits of green tea are attributed to its natural antioxidants, namely, catechins, which are phenolic compounds with diverse beneficial effects on human health. The beneficial effects of green tea and its major bioactive component, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on health include high antioxidative, osteoprotective, neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-hyperlipidemia and anti-diabetic effects. However, the review of green tea's benefits on female reproductive disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis and dysmenorrhea, remains scarce. Thus, this review summarises current knowledge on the beneficial effects of green tea catechins on selected female reproductive disorders. Green tea or its derivative, EGCG, improves endometriosis mainly through anti-angiogenic, anti-fibrotic, anti-proliferative and proapoptotic mechanisms. Moreover, green tea enhances ovulation and reduces cyst formation in PCOS while improving generalised hyperalgesia, and reduces plasma corticosterone levels and uterine contractility in dysmenorrhea. However, information on clinical trials is inadequate for translating excellent findings on green tea benefits in animal endometriosis models. Thus, future clinical intervention studies are needed to provide clear evidence of the green tea benefits with regard to these diseases.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Alcohol consumption is associated with hyperuricemia and gout. Previous studies have indicated a role for green tea catechins in uric acid (UA) metabolism. This study aimed to elucidate the acute effect of green tea catechins in terms of enhancing urinary excretion of UA and xanthine/hypoxanthine (Xa/HX; UA precursors) after alcohol ingestion. METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, ten healthy Japanese subjects consumed test meals, including a Japanese distilled spirit (Shōchū) with water (SW) or Shōchū with catechin-rich green tea (SC), each containing 20 g of alcohol. The SC contained 617 mg of catechin in total. Serum and urine UA and Xa/HX concentrations were measured. Blood samples were collected after 2.5 h, and urine samples were collected between 0 and 5 h after consuming the test meal. RESULTS: Urine UA and Xa/HX excretions were significantly higher in the SC group than in the SW group (UA: SW, 0.45 ± 0.08; SC, 0.52 ± 0.09; Xa/HX: SW, 0.08 ± 0.04; SC, 0.16 ± 0.05 mg/kg/h). UA clearance (CUA) and fractional UA excretion (FEUA) tended to increase more in the SC group than in the SW group (CUA: SW, 7.76 ± 2.14; SC, 8.75 ± 2.23 mL/min/1.73 m2; FEUA: SW, 6.08 ± 1.36; SC, 6.64 ± 1.42%). No significant differences in serum UA and Xa/HX concentrations were observed between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that green tea catechins can enhance the excretion of UA and Xa/HX, even though alcohol is ingested. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000040076. Retrospectively registered 7 April 2020. https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000045687 Key Points • Green tea catechins enhance the excretion of uric acid and xanthine/hypoxanthine, even when alcohol is ingested simultaneously. • In case of non-adherence of limiting alcohol intake, catechin-rich green tea may be an effective dietary component to continue dietary therapy.",

While searching for an anti-FDP reagent, we found that green tea extract (GTE) and fractions rich in flavonol glycosides (FLGs) and crude tea polysaccharides (CTPs) had protective effects against FDP-stimulated cellular damage in the BEAS-2B airway epithelial cell line. The GTE, FLGs, and CTPs significantly increased viability and lowered oxidative stress levels in FDP-treated cells. Combined treatment with GTE, FLGs, and CTPs also exerted synergistic protective effects on cells and attenuated FDP-induced elevations in inflammatory gene expression. Moreover, the green tea components increased the proportion of ciliated cells and upregulated ciliogenesis in the airway in FDP-stimulated BEAS-2B cells. Our findings provide insights into how natural phytochemicals protect the airway and suggest that green tea could be used to reduce FDP-induced airway damage as an ingredient in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and also cosmeceutical products.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is the second most common disease only secondary to cardiovascular disease, with the risk of fracture increasing with age. Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance between osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis processes. Osteoclastogenesis may be enhanced, osteoblastogenesis may be reduced, or both may be evident. Inflammation and high reactive oxygen enhance osteoclastogenesis while reducing osteoblastogenesis by inducing osteoblast apoptosis and suppressing osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation. Catechins, the main polyphenols found in green tea with potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, can counteract the deleterious effects of the imbalance of osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis caused by osteoporosis. Green tea catechins can attenuate osteoclastogenesis by enhancing apoptosis of osteoclasts, hampering osteoclastogenesis, and prohibiting bone resorption in vitro. Catechin effects can be directly exerted on pre-osteoclasts/osteoclasts or indirectly exerted via the modulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)/stromal cell regulation of pre-osteoclasts through activation of the nuclear factor kB (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system. Catechins also can enhance osteoblastogenesis by enhancing osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and increasing osteoblastic survival, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. The in vitro effects of catechins on osteogenesis have been confirmed in several animal models, as well as in epidemiological observational studies on human subjects. Even though randomized control trials have not shown that catechins provide anti-fracture efficacy, safety data in the trials are promising. A large-scale, placebo-controlled, long-term randomized trial with a tea regimen intervention of optimal duration is required to determine anti-fracture efficacy."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by the apoptosis of cholinergic neurons and the consequent attenuation of acetylcholine mediated neurotransmission, resulting in neurodegeneration. Acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BuChE) are attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of AD since inhibition of these enzymes can be used to restore synaptic concentrations of acetylcholine. Whilst inhibitors for these enzymes such as galantamine and rivastigmine have been approved for use, none are able to halt the progression of AD and are responsible for the production of troublesome side-effects. Efficacious cholinesterase inhibitors have been isolated from natural plant-based compounds with many demonstrating additional benefits beyond cholinesterase inhibition, such as antioxidation and anti-inflammation, which are key parts of AD pathology. In this study, five natural flavan-3-ol (catechin) compounds: ((-)-epicatechin (EC), catechin, (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG),) (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), isolated from green tea, were screened for their cholinesterase inhibitory activity using the Ellman assay. The kinetics of inhibition was determined using reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. EGCG was the only compound found to produce statistically significant, competitive inhibition, of both AChE (p < 0.01) and BuChE (p < 0.01) with IC50 values of 0.0148 µmol/mL and 0.0251 µmol/mL respectively. These results, combined with previously identified antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, highlight the potential use of EGCG in the treatment of AD, provided it can be delivered to cholinergic neurons in therapeutic concentrations. Further testing of EGCG in vivo is recommended to fully characterise the pharmacokinetic properties, optimal method of administration and efficacy of this novel plant-based compound.",

Methods: To evaluate the antibacterial potential of the developed NE, microtiter biofilm formation assay was performed. The cytotoxicity analysis was done to assess the toxicity profile of the NEs. Further antibacterial analysis against uropathogenic strains was performed to check the developed NEs were effective against these strains. Results: In microtiter dish biofilm formation assay, both NE formulations inhibited the growth more effectively (Av. % inhibition ~84%) as compared to corresponding aqueous solution (Av. % inhibition ~64%) and placebo (Av. % inhibition ~59%) at their respective minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Cytotoxicity analysis using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT assay) showed that the formulations were nontoxic to Vero cells. The antibacterial studies against uropathogenic resistant strains also showed that NEs effectively inhibited the growth of bacterial strains. Conclusion: From different studies it was concluded that both the NE's were able to inhibit bacterial strains and could be further used for the treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). The antibacterial activity of developed NEs showed that these could be used as alternative therapies for the treatment of UTI."

This study aimed to examine the effect of repeated intake of tea catechins on energy metabolism in the resting state in middle-aged men and women. METHODS: A total of 30 middle-aged men and women [13 women; age (mean ± SD) 52 ± 4 years; BMI 21.9 ± 2.2 kg/m2] were recruited. A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted using a tea catechin-enriched beverage (611 mg catechins, 88 mg caffeine) and a placebo beverage (0 mg catechins, 81 mg caffeine) as test beverages. After 2 weeks of continuous test beverage intake, fasting RMR and energy expenditure (EE) after the ingestion of test beverage were measured. Measurements of forehead temperature (proxy for core temperature) and skin temperature were also obtained simultaneously. RESULTS: Among participants who underwent measurements, 26 (10 women; mean age 52 ± 4 years; mean BMI 22.1 ± 2.1 kg/m2) were analyzed. The EE increased significantly after ingestion of the tea catechin beverage compared with the placebo beverage (placebo treatment: 5502 ± 757 kJ/day; catechin treatment: 5598 ± 800 kJ/day; P = 0.041). No between-treatment differences in fasting RMR or the respiratory quotient were detected. In addition, the forehead and skin temperature did not differ significantly between the placebo and catechin treatments. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that continuous intake of tea catechins with caffeine for 2 weeks significantly increased EE after ingestion of the tea catechin but not fasting RMR in middle-aged men and women.

Despite the existence of various treatment strategies, treatment of prostate cancer still presents serious difficulties (especially in advanced stages). Polyphenols have been extensively assessed in terms of their potential use for prostate cancer treatment and prevention. Catechins are among the most well-known polyphenols in this respect. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we summarize clinical study results concerning catechin applications with regard to prostate cancer treatment and prevention. We discuss some of the main mechanisms of the anticarcinogenic action of catechins. CONCLUSION: The main mechanisms of the anticarcinogenic action of catechins are subdivided into two major types: (i) direct action on cancer cells and (ii) indirect effect based on catechins's impact on the microenvironment of cancer cells, particularly in relation to the immune system. At this level catechins might reduce tumor-associated inflammation and immune tolerance.",

Tea catechins, including epicatechin, epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3- O-gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin-3- O-gallate (EGCG), are considered as the major bioactive polyphenols in tea. The present study was designed to elucidate the potential antifibrogenic role of three abundant tea catechins (ECG, EGC, and EGCG) in a CCl4-induced fibrotic rat and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Tea catechins, especially groups of ECG, EGC, and EGCG, effectively induced several beneficial alterations of liver injury markers, oxidative status, and liver histology. Furthermore, catechins ameliorated liver fibrosis, as evidenced by the reduced expression of desmin, α-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and downstream ERK1/2 and Smad1/2 phosphorylation. The most significant inhibitory effect on those proteins was observed in ECG (300 mg/kg) and EGCG (300 mg/kg) groups. In addition, catechins conferred their protective role by downregulating the proinflammation cytokines TGF-β, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 17. It is postulated that tea catechins, particularly ECG and EGCG, are potential therapeutic candidates in antifibrotic therapy.",

Green-tea-extract (GTE) constituents possess antiangiogenesis properties. We used VEGF to induce human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and applied GTE, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and mixtures of different compositions of purified catechins (M1 and M2) to evaluate their efficacies of inhibition and their underlying mechanisms using cell-cycle analysis and untargeted metabolomics techniques. GTE, EGCG, M1, and M2 induced HUVEC apoptosis by 22.1 ± 2, 20.0 ± 0.7, 50.7 ± 8.5, and 69.8 ± 4.1%, respectively. GTE exerted a broad, balanced metabolomics spectrum, involving suppression of the biosynthesis of cellular building blocks and oxidative-phosphorylation metabolites as well as promotion of the biosynthesis of membrane lipids and growth factors. M2 mainly induced mechanisms associated with energy and biosynthesis suppression. Therefore, GTE exerted mechanisms involving both promotion and suppression activities, whereas purified catechins induced extensive apoptosis. GTE could be a more promising antineovascularization remedy for ocular treatment.",

This study aimed to establish the feasibility and acceptability of dietary modification in men at increased risk of prostate cancer. Men were invited with a PSA level of 2.0-2.95 ng/mL or 3.0-19.95 ng/mL with negative prostate biopsies. Randomization (3 × 3 factorial design) to daily green tea and lycopene: green tea drink (3 cups, unblinded) or capsules [blinded, 600 mg flavan-3-ol ()-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) or placebo] and lycopene-rich foods (unblinded) or capsules (blinded, 15 mg lycopene or placebo) for 6 months. Primary endpoints were randomization rates and intervention adherence (blinded assessment of metabolites) at 6 months with secondary endpoints of acceptability (from interviews), safety, weight, blood pressure, and PSA. A total of 133 of 469 (28.4%) men approached agreed to be randomized and 132 were followed-up (99.2%). Mean lycopene was 1.28 [95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.09-1.50, P = 0.003] times higher in the lycopene capsule group and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.21-1.66; P < 0.001) times higher in the lycopene-enriched diet group compared with placebo capsules. Median EGCG was 10.7 nmol/L (95% CI, 7.0-32.0) higher in in the active capsule group and 20.0 nmol/L (95% CI, 0.0-19.0) higher in the green tea drink group compared with placebo capsules (both P < 0.001). All interventions were acceptable and well tolerated although men preferred the capsules. Dietary prevention is acceptable to men at risk of prostate cancer.

The failures of conventional therapeutic options as well as the predicted dramatic rise in the prevalence of cognitive decline in the coming future show the necessity for novel therapeutic agents. Recently, a wide range of research has focused on pharmacological activities of green tea catechins worldwide. Current investigations have clarified mechanistic effects of the catechins in inflammatory cascades, oxidative damages, different cellular transcription as well as transduction pathway in various body systems. It has been demonstrated that green tea polyphenols prevent age-related neurodegeneration through improvement of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms, modulation of neural growth factors, attenuation of neuroinflammatory pathway, and regulation of apoptosis. The catechins exhibited beneficial effects in cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, MS, and Parkinson's disease. The present review discusses the current pharmacological targets, which can be involved in the treatment of cognitive decline and addresses the action of catechin derivatives elicited from green tea on the multiple neural targets.",

Produced mainly in Asian countries from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, the potential health benefits have been widely studied. Recently, researchers have studied the ability of green tea to eradicate infectious agents and the ability to actually prevent infections. The important components in green tea that show antimicrobial properties are the catechins. The four main catechins that occur in green tea are (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Of these catechins, EGCG and EGC are found in the highest amounts in green tea and have been the subject of most of the studies. These catechins have been shown to demonstrate a variety of antimicrobial properties, both to organisms affected and in mechanisms used. Consumption of green tea has been shown to distribute these compounds and/or their metabolites throughout the body, which allows for not only the possibility of treatment of infections but also the prevention of infections.",

DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design randomized controlled trial with 26-day intervention phases and a 30-day washout period. SETTING: The Institute for Dementia Research and Prevention at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Ten independently-living, cognitively-healthy older adults (mean age: 67.3 + 2.01 years). INTERVENTION: Daily consumption of an investigational product (trade name \"Cerbella TM\") consisting of an emulsified liquid combination of standardized fish oil, panax ginseng extract, and green tea catechins in a flavored base of lecithin phospholipids optimized to maximize bioavailability of the active ingredients. MEASUREMENTS: Before and after supplementation with the investigational product or placebo, participants completed cognitive tests including the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), Stroop test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and Immediate and Delayed Recall tests, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a standard cognitive task switching paradigm. RESULTS: Performance on the MMSE, Stroop test, and DSST increased significantly over one month of supplementation with the investigational product (one-sample t tests, p<.05) although differences between these changes and corresponding changes during supplementation with placebo were not significant (two-sample t tests, p>.05). During supplementation with the investigational product, brain activation during task performance increased significantly more than during supplementation with placebo in brain regions known to be activated by this task (anterior and posterior cingulate cortex). Functional connectivity during task execution between task regions (middle frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex) increased significantly during supplementation with the investigational product, relative to placebo. Functional connectivity during rest between task regions (precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus) and default mode network regions (medial frontal gyrus and precuneus) decreased during supplementation with the investigational product relative to placebo, suggesting greater segregation of task and rest related brain activity. CONCLUSION: One-month supplementation with a combination of omega 3 essential fatty acids, green tea catechins, and ginsenosides was associated with suggestive changes in cognitive functioning as well as modification of brain activation and brain functional connectivity in cognitively healthy older adults.",

      "abstract": "Tea is one of the most consumed beverages in the world. Green tea, black tea, and oolong tea are made from the same plant Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze. Among them, green tea has been the most extensively studied for beneficial effects on diseases including cancer, obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Several human observational and intervention studies have found beneficial effects of tea consumption on neurodegenerative impairment, such as cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. These studies supported the basis of tea's preventive effects of Parkinson's disease, but few studies have revealed such effects on Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, several human studies have not reported these favorable effects with regard to tea. This discrepancy may be due to incomplete adjustment of confounding factors, including the method of quantifying consumption, beverage temperature, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and differences in genetic and environmental factors, such as race, sex, age, and lifestyle. Thus, more rigorous human studies are required to understand the neuroprotective effect of tea. A number of laboratory experiments demonstrated the benefits of green tea and green tea catechins (GTCs), such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and proposed action mechanisms. The targets of GTCs include the abnormal accumulation of fibrous proteins, such as Aβ and α-synuclein, inflammation, elevated expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, and oxidative stress, which are associated with neuronal cell dysfunction and death in the cerebral cortex. Computational molecular docking analysis revealed how EGCG can prevent the accumulation of fibrous proteins. These findings suggest that GTCs have the potential to be used in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and could be useful for the development of new drugs.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat especially when it becomes hormone resistant such as castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and subsequent metastatic CRPC. Apart from the genetic alterations in prostate cancer, epigenetic modifications also play an important role in the development and neoplastic progression of this disease. These include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding microRNAs. miRNAs are a novel class of small endogenous single-stranded non-coding RNAs of 19-25 nucleotides in length that typically silence gene expression. Considering the reversibility of epigenetic alterations in early carcinogenesis process, reversion (correction) of these modifications by green tea catechins could be a promising strategy for cancer chemoprevention and therapy. Recent evidence suggests that green tea catechins such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) not only act as epigenetic modulators but can also modify miRNA expression and their target mRNAs, consistently contributing to the inhibition of prostate carcinogenesis. Various studies also indicate that several green tea polyphenols (GTPs) exert synergistic effects with other cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, the use of appropriate combinations of green tea catechins with the existing chemotherapeutics will lead to a reduction in side effects without decreasing the chemotherapeutic effects. This review will summarize the key results from recent studies detailing the effects of green tea catechins such as EGCG on epigenetic alterations and miRNA expression in prostate cancer.",

In order to evaluate the efficacy of green tea catechins for chemoprevention of PCa in patients with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) we performed a phase II clinical trial. METHODS: Sixty volunteers with HG-PIN were enrolled to carry out a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. Treated group took daily 600 mg of green tea catechins (Categ Plus®) for 1 year. Patients were screened at 6 and 12 months through prostatic biopsy and measurements of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). RESULTS: Despite the statistically significant reduction of PSA observed in subjects who received green tea catechins for 6 and 12 months, we did not find any statistical difference in PCa incidence between the experimental groups neither after 6 nor after 12 months. However, throughout the one-year follow- up we observed very limited adverse effects induced by green tea catechins and a not significant improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Although the small number of patients enrolled in our study and the relatively short duration of intervention, our findings seems to deny the efficacy of green tea catechins. However, results of our clinical study, mainly for its low statistical strength, suggest that the effectiveness of green tea catechins should be evaluated in both a larger cohort of men and longer trial.",

Based on the mixture design, 28 experiments were performed to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) in RAW 264.7 cells and hepatotoxicity in Chang liver cells. Significant candidates, EGCG, EC, gallocatechin and catechin, were selected after optimization. The combination showing simultaneous enhancement of NO inhibition and reduction of hepatotoxicity was EGCG and gallocatechin at a ratio of 0.65 to 0.35 by surface response methodology and desirability function, through which their co-treatment was validated. Here, we describe a platform for simultaneously determining the optimized combination of natural components exerting enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although preclinical, epidemiological and prior clinical trial data suggest that green tea catechins (GTCs) may reduce prostate cancer (PCa) risk, several preclinical studies and case reports have reported liver toxicities and acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on these observations, regulatory bodies have required stringent inclusion criteria with frequent, excessive toxicity monitoring and early stopping rules in clinical trials. These requirements have impeded recruitment and retention of subjects in chemoprevention trials and subsequent progress in agent development efforts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of Polyphenon E® (PolyE®), a proprietary mixture of decaffeinated GTCs, containing 400 mg (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) per day, in 97 men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and/or atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP). PolyE® containing 200 mg EGCG was administered with food, BID. A secondary study endpoint in this trial was a comparison of the overall one-year treatment related adverse events and grade 3 or higher adverse event on the two study arms. Monthly assessments of toxicity (CTCAE 4.0), concomitant medications and organ function, including hepatic panel, PT/PTT and LDH, were performed. RESULTS: Daily intake of a standardized, decaffeinated, catechin mixture containing 200 mg EGCG BID taken with food for 1 year accumulated in plasma and was well tolerated and did not produce treatment related adverse effects in men with baseline HGPIN or ASAP. CONCLUSION: The current data provides evidence of safety of decaffeinated, catechin mixture containing 200 mg EGCG BID to be further tested for prostate cancer prevention or other indications.",

We first review our brief historical development of green tea cancer prevention. Based on exciting evidence that green tea catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in drinking water inhibited lung metastasis of B16 melanoma cells, we and other researchers have studied the inhibitory mechanisms of metastasis with green tea catechins using biomechanical tools, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microfluidic optical stretcher. Specifically, determination of biophysical properties of cancer cells, low cell stiffness, and high deformability in relation to migration, along with biophysical effects, were studied by treatment with green tea catechins. The study with AFM revealed that low average values of Young's moduli, indicating low cell stiffness, are closely associated with strong potential of cell migration and metastasis for various cancer cells. It is important to note that treatments with EGCG and green tea extract elevated the average values of Young's moduli resulting in increased stiffness (large elasticity) of melanomas and various cancer cells. We discuss here the biophysical basis of multifunctions of green tea catechins and green tea extract leading to beneficial effects for cancer prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with the active phases of tissue and bone destruction in periodontitis, an inflammatory disease characterized by a significant breakdown of tooth support. In the present study, we used a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture model of macrophages and gingival fibroblasts to investigate the ability of a green tea extract and its major constituent epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to regulate the secretion of MMP-3, -8, and -9. METHODS: The 3D co-culture model was composed of gingival fibroblasts embedded in a type I collagen matrix overlaid with macrophages. Two arbitrary ratios were tested. The ratio composed of 1 macrophage to 10 fibroblasts was used to mimic a slightly inflamed periodontal site while the ratio composed of 10 macrophages to 1 fibroblast was used to mimic a severely inflamed periodontal site. The 3D co-culture model was pre-treated for 2h with either the green tea extract or EGCG. It was then stimulated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The model was also first stimulated with LPS for 2h and then incubated with the green tea extract or EGCG. The concentrations of secreted MMP-3, -8, and -9 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassays. RESULTS: When the 3D co-culture model was stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, the 10:1 ratio of macrophages to gingival fibroblasts was associated with a highest secretion of MMP-3 and -9 and, to a lesser extent, MMP-8, than the 1:10 ratio. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of the green tea extract or EGCG reduced the basal secretion levels of all three MMPs. A 2-h treatment with the green tea extract or EGCG prior to the stimulation with LPS resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in MMP secretion, with MMP-9 showing the most significant decrease. A decrease in MMP secretion was also observed when the green tea extract or EGCG was added following a 2-h stimulation with LPS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that green tea catechins, and more specifically EGCG, offer promising prospects for the development of a novel adjunctive treatment for periodontitis because of their ability to decrease the secretion of MMPs, which are important tissue-destructive enzymes produced by mucosal and immune cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nutritional and absorption-promoting properties of stachyose combined with tea catechins (TC) have been revealed. However, the mechanism involved in non-digestible oligosaccharides-mediated enhancement of flavonoid absorption has largely remained elusive. METHODS: This study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of stachyose in enhancing absorption and transportation of TC in mice. Mice were orally pre-treated with stachyose (50, 250, and 500 mg/kg·bw) for 0-8 weeks, and 1 h before sacrifice, mice were treated with TC (250 mg/kg·bw). RESULTS: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that serum concentrations of epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate were dose- and time-dependently elevated with stachyose pre-treatment in mice. Furthermore, pre-treatment with stachyose in mice reduced intestinal sulfotransferase and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase levels by 3.3-43.2% and 23.9-30.4%, relative to control mice, respectively. Moreover, intestinal P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 contents were decreased in mice by pre-administration of stachyose in dose- and time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time to demonstrate that suppression of Phase II metabolic enzymes and efflux transporters of TC in the intestine can play a major role in increasing absorption of TC by stachyose feeding."

The catechins were isolated from green tea leaves of Assam, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand regions of India. The synergistic activity of combinations against Candida species was assessed following microdilution checkerboard technique and time kill assay. The inhibitory action of most significant combination on treated Candida cells was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Cytotoxicity of synergistic compositions was further analyzed by performing MTT assay on Vero cell lines. Purified catechins of Assam and Himachal Pradesh green tea showed synergistic activity with fluconazole and amphotericin B against Candida species. Time kill assay depicted synergistic activity at minimum inhibitory concentration and twice of minimum inhibitory concentration of purified catechins and antimycotics. Further, Copper sulphate increased anticandidal efficacy of synergistic combinations by 0.4% to 6.63%. SEM analysis revealed morphological distortions of treated Candida cells. Cytotoxicity analysis of synergistic composition depicted high percentage viability (≥91.4% to≥100%) of Vero cell line, which suggests non-cytotoxic activity of proposed composition on healthy cells. It can be inferred that present evaluated synergistic composition can confer promising anticandidal efficacy and requires further investigation of safety and translational guidelines for effective and safer green tea based potent therapeutic drug.",

Understanding the molecular interaction of these compounds with various anti-Parkinsonian drug targets is of interest. The present study is intended to explore binding modes of catechins with molecular targets having potential role in PD. Lamarckian genetic algorithm methodology was adopted for molecular docking simulations employing AutoDock 4.2 program. Toxicity potential and molecular properties responsible for good pharmacokinetic profile were calculated by Osiris property explorer and Molinspiration online toolkit, respectively. A strong correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.893) was obtained between experimentally reported and docking predicted activities of native co-crystallized ligands of the 18 target receptors used in current study. Analysis of docked conformations revealed monoamine oxidase-B as most promising, while N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was recognized as the least favorable target for catechins. Benzopyran skeleton with a phenyl group substituted at the 2-position and a hydroxyl (or ester) function at the 3-position has been identified as common structural requirements at majority of the targets. The present findings suggest that epigallocatechin gallate is the most promising lead to be developed as multitarget drug for the design and development of novel anti-Parkinsonian agents.",

These catechins-caffeine mixtures seem to counteract the decrease in metabolic rate that occurs during weight loss. Their effects are of particular importance during weight maintenance after weight loss. Other metabolic targets may be fat absorption and the gut microbiota composition, but these effects still need further investigation in combination with weight loss. Limitations for the effects of green tea catechins are moderating factors such as genetic predisposition related to COMT-activity, habitual caffeine intake, and ingestion combined with dietary protein. In conclusion, a mixture of green tea catechins and caffeine has a beneficial effect on body-weight management, especially by sustained energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and preservation of fat free body-mass, after energy restriction induced body-weight loss, when taking the limitations into account.",

This study investigated the chemical conversions of 8 catechins under heat treatment with the involvement of epimerization, hydrolysis and oxidation/condensation reactions. Three reactions were enhanced as temperature increased from 30 °C to 90 °C. The epimerization of non-gallated catechins was favored by epi-configuration but hindered by pyrogallol moiety, and the hydrolysis reaction of gallated catechins was facilitated by pyrogallol moiety. Epicatechin and epigallocatechin had the lowest thermostabilities due to epimerization and oxidation/condensation reactions respectively. Sufficient O2 was not a precondition for the occurrence of chemical conversions of catechins under heat treatment. Non-enzymatic oligomerization occurred to epi type catechins and catechin under heat treatment, and dehydrodicatechins A were mainly responsible for the browning of epicatechin and catechin solutions. The evidence of generation of catechin oligomers provides a novel way to explain sensory change of tea and relevant products during thermal processing.",

      "abstract": "Dietary flavonoids may protect against sunburn inflammation in skin. Preliminary reports using less complete analysis suggest that certain catechins and their metabolites are found in skin biopsies and blister fluid after consumption of green tea; however, it is not known if they are affected by solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation (UVR) or whether conjugated forms, with consequently altered bioactivity, are present. The present study tested the hypothesis that UVR affects the catechin levels in the skin of healthy volunteers after consumption of green tea and how catechins in the plasma are related to their presence in skin tissue samples. In an open oral intervention study, 11 subjects consumed green tea and vitamin C supplements daily for 3months. Presupplementation and postsupplementation plasma samples, suction blister fluid and skin biopsies were collected; the latter two samples were collected both before and after UVR. A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assay was used to measure the intact catechin metabolites, conjugates and free forms. Seven green tea catechins and their corresponding metabolites were identified postsupplementation in skin biopsies, 20 in blister fluid and 26 in plasma, with 15 green tea catechin metabolites present in both blister fluid and plasma. The valerolactone, O-methyl-M4-O-sulfate, a gut microbiota metabolite of catechins, was significantly increased 1.6-fold by UVR in blister fluid samples. In conclusion, there were some common catechin metabolites in the plasma and blister fluid, and the concentration was always higher in plasma. The results suggest that green tea catechins and metabolites are bioavailable in skin and provide a novel link between catechin metabolites derived from the skin and gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "Green tea catechins have been shown to attenuate obesity in animals and humans. The catechins activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and thereby increase fatty acid oxidation in liver and skeletal muscles. Green tea catechins have also been shown to reduce body fat in humans. However, the effect of the catechins on lipolysis in adipose tissue has not been fully understood. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of green tea catechins on lipolysis in adipocytes and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Differentiated mouse adipocyte cell line (3T3-L1) was stimulated with green tea catechins in the presence or absence of norepinephrine. Glycerol and free fatty acids in the media were measured. Phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was determined by Western blotting, and the mRNA expression levels of HSL, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and perilipin were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The cells were treated with inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase G (PKG), or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to determine the responsible pathway. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with green tea catechins increased the level of glycerol and free fatty acids released into the media in the presence, but not absence, of norepinephrine, and increased the level of phosphorylated HSL in the cells. The catechins also increased mRNA and protein levels of HSL and ATGL. PKA inhibitor (H89) attenuated the catechin-induced increase in glycerol release and HSL phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that green tea catechins enhance lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine via a PKA-dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, providing a potential mechanism by which green tea catechins could reduce body fat.",

Based on these results, we paid special attention to Japanese cancer patients, who consume green tea every day and are administered anticancer drugs. This encouraged us to study whether the combination of green tea catechins and anticancer drugs has the potential to enhance the efficacy of the drugs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The combination of GTE and NSAIDs synergistically inhibited tumor development in rodents through the activation of the GADD153-DR5-TRAIL apoptotic pathway. Since then, this study was further extended by various investigators to the combinations of EGCG and other green tea catechins with anticancer compounds, the latter of which include NSAIDs, phytochemicals, and anticancer drugs. In order to demonstrate whether diversity of the combinations would generally induce synergistic anticancer effects on numerous human cancer cell lines, we studied the results of 42 in vitro combination experiments and the synergistic inhibition of tumor volume of 13 combination experiments using xenograft mouse models, which were previously reported by other investigators. The various combinations of EGCG and anticancer compounds induced similar synergistic anticancer effects for both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and showed an average reduction in tumor volume by 70.3%. Considering the evidence showing that treatment with EGCG inhibited self-renewal of cancer stem cells, the combination shows a great advantage. CONCLUSION: Green tea is a cancer preventive for humans, showing a new trend of green tea catechins as synergists with anticancer compounds.",

Experimental trials suggest a synergistic interaction of green tea catechins with tamoxifen or raloxifene in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer through estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. No evidence of an interaction of green tea catechins with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant has been reported. As green tea catechins are natural compounds with a rather favorable safety profile, the strategy of co-administrating green tea catechins with tamoxifen seems to be a rational approach in chemoprevention, adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer treatment that needs further investigation.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate a natural formulation containing tea catechins in 60 patients with xerostomia, including patients with Sjögren syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: This study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design. The functional placebo contained all natural formulation ingredients and 500 mg xylitol, but without the key plant extracts. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of therapy, the xylitol-containing placebo failed to modulate saliva output. In comparison, the catechin-containing natural formulation resulted in a statistically significant increase in unstimulated (3.8-fold) and stimulated (2.1-fold) saliva output vs baseline. The quality of life score showed a significant improvement in both groups but no significant difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The catechin-containing natural formula partially restored salivary function in patients with xerostomia and provided an objective improvement in saliva output, which warrants large-scale clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) plays crucial functions in multiple stages of mitosis and is considered to be a potential drug target for cancer therapy. The functions of PLK1 are mediated by its N-terminal kinase domain and C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD). Most inhibitors targeting the kinase domain of PLK1 have a selectivity issue because of a high degree of structural conservation within kinase domains of all protein kinases. Here, we combined virtual and experimental screenings to identify green tea catechins as potent inhibitors of the PLK1 PBD. Initially, (-)-epigallocatechin, one of the main components of green tea polyphenols, was found to significantly block the binding of fluorescein-labeled phosphopeptide to the PBD at a concentration of 10 μm. Next, additional catechins were evaluated for their dose-dependent inhibition of the PBD and preliminary structure-activity relationships were derived. Cellular analysis further showed that catechins interfere with the proper subcellular localization of PLK1, lead to cell-cycle arrest in the S and G2M phases, and induce growth inhibition of several human cancer cell types, such as breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), lung adenocarcinoma (A549), and cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa). Our data provides new insight into understanding the anticancer activities of green tea catechins.",

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), one of the major tea catechins, has been widely associated with cancer prevention and treatment. In addition, tea catechins in combination with anticancer drugs are being evaluated as a new cancer treatment strategy. However, the interactions of anticancer drugs with tea catechins are largely unknown. Accumulated data indicate significant interactions between anticancer drugs and tea catechins, such as synergistic tumor inhibition or antagonist activity. Therefore, it is critical to understand comprehensively the effects of tea catechins on anticancer drugs. Focusing on evidence from preclinical studies, this paper will review the interactions between anticancer drugs and tea catechins, including pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics effects. We hope that by detailing the interactions between anticancer drugs and tea catechins, more attention will be directed to this important therapeutic combination in the future.",

      "abstract": "Delivery of optimal amounts of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to regions of the brain affected by neurodegenerative diseases is a daunting task. Using natural products with neuroprotective properties, such as green tea polyphenols, would be a highly useful complementary approach for inexpensive long-term treatment of these diseases. In this study, we used PC12(TrkB) cells which ectopically express TrkB, a high affinity receptor for BDNF. They differentiate and induce neurite outgrowth in response to BDNF. Using this model, we show for the first time that treatment with extremely low concentrations (<0.1 μg/ml) of unfractionated green tea polyphenols (GTPP) and low concentrations (<0.5 μM) of their active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), potentiated the neuritogenic ability of a low concentration (2 ng/ml) of BDNF. A synergistic interaction was observed between GTPP constituents, where epigallocatechin and epicatechin, both individually lacking this activity, promoted the action of EGCG. GTPP-induced potentiation of BDNF action required the cell-surface associated 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) to which EGCG binds with high affinity. A cell-permeable catalase abolished GTPP/EGCG-induced potentiation of BDNF action, suggesting the possible involvement of H2O2 in the potentiation. Consistently, exogenous sublethal concentrations of H2O2, added as a bolus dose (5 μM) or more effectively through a steady-state generation (1 μM), potentiated BDNF action. Collectively, these results suggest that EGCG, dependent on 67 LR and H2O2, potentiates the neuritogenic action of BDNF. Intriguingly, this effect requires only submicromolar concentrations of EGCG. This is significant as extremely low concentrations of polyphenols are believed to reach the brain after drinking green tea.",

      "abstract": "We developed an analytical method for the simultaneous determination of tea catechins and gallic acid (GA) in human serum using ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. GA was measured to estimate the amount of gallate moiety produced by degradation of gallated catechins ((-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, ECG; (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, EGCG). Ethyl gallate was adopted as an internal standard to correct for the extraction efficiency. To maximize extraction efficiency, a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter was selected for pre-treatment prior to separation. HPLC separation was performed using a C18 reversed-phase column with a gradient mobile phase of phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) containing tetrahexylammonium hydrogensulfate as an ion-pair reagent. Using this method, (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), ECG, EGCG, ethyl gallate, and GA were detected as single peaks. The resolution values for target analytes were 4.0-13.0 and the mean values of the absolute recoveries of catechins and GA were 77.3-93.9%. The detection limits for catechins and GA in serum were 0.4-3.1ng/mL. The serum catechin levels of eight healthy volunteers after ingestion of a single dose of green tea tablets were measured using this method. The concentration of total catechins (free+conjugated forms) in serum peaked 60min after ingestion. From these results, this method is thought to enable the simultaneous quantification of GA, the hydrolysis product of gallated catechins, and target catechins, and to be sufficiently sensitive for pharmacokinetic studies of catechins following oral administration of green tea.",

We summarize the efficacy of a single catechin and the synergetic effects of multiple catechins. We also discuss the enhanced anticancer effects of green tea catechins when they are combined with anticancer drugs. The information present in this review might promote the development of strategy for the co-administration of green tea catechins with other anticancer drugs to increase the potency of currently available anticancer medicine.

Despite advances in breast cancer treatment, mortality from breast cancer is still high. Undoubtedly novel treatment strategies are needed for chemoprevention of high risk women and for the treatment of receptor negative breast cancer. Green tea catechins have been shown to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells and to block carcinogenesis. This review attempts a critical presentation of the mechanisms of action of green tea catechins in breast cancer. Several mechanisms of action of green tea catechins in breast cancer have been proposed including modulation of extracellular signalling, induction of apoptosis through redox regulation, or through modulation of epigenetic alterations. A number of molecular targets of green tea catechins have been suggested i.e molecular chaperones, telomerase, apoptotic cascade. Although the molecular links among the proposed mechanisms of action of green tea catechins are often missing, it must be emphasized that all the proposed mechanisms indicate that green tea catechins inhibit growth and /or promote apoptosis. It would be interesting if future experimental trials could take into account that green tea catechins are multi-target agents and attempt to link every novel proposed target with the other already proposed targets of green tea catechins.",

At the doses that conferred protection against lethal polymicrobial infection (induced by cecal ligation and puncture), EGCG significantly reduced bacterial loads particularly in the liver and lung. To elucidate its bactericidal mechanisms, we determined whether EGCG affected the fluorescence intensities of bacteria-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 dyes. When mixed with unconjugated Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 dyes, EGCG or analogs did not affect the fluorescence intensity of these dyes. In a sharp contrast, EGCG and some analogs (e.g., Catechin Gallate, CG), markedly reduced the fluorescence intensity of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus-conjugated Alexa 594 and Gram-negative Escherichia coli-conjugated Alexa 488. Interestingly, co-treatment with ethanol impaired the EGCG-mediated fluorescence quenching of the G(+) S. aureus, but not of the G(-) E. coli-conjugated Alexa Flour dyes. In light of the notion that Alexa Fluor dyes can be quenched by aromatic amino acids, it is plausible that EGCG exerts antimicrobial activities possibly by altering microbial protein conformations and functions. This possibility can now be explored by screening other fluorescence-quenching agents for possible antimicrobial activities.",

This systematic review aims to generate in vitro and in vivo data on the effect of green tea catechins on breast carcinogenesis. Electronic databases were searched with the appropriate search terms. Existing evidence suggests that green tea catechins modulate breast cell carcinogenesis. The effect of green tea catechins on breast cell carcinogenesis has been investigated in different experimental models and under different experimental conditions, that is, carcinogen investigated, green tea catechin dosage regimen, treatment with green tea extract versus pure synthetic EGCG, and time point of treatment with green tea catechins in relation to the exposure to the carcinogen. Although the effect of green tea catechins was not always statistically significant, the protective effect of green tea catechins was demonstrated in all the trials, suggesting that treatment with green tea catechins should be further investigated in the clinical setting of chemoprevention of high-risk women. However, it should be emphasized that the reported actions of green tea catechins are observed in high concentrations that are difficult to achieve in the clinical setting. This drawback could be overcome by designing green tea catechins with better bioavailability and/or by cotreatment combining breast cancer endocrine treatment with green tea catechins.",

Over the last few decades, green tea has been subjected to many scientific and medical studies. AIM: The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of green tea catechins on the red complex organisms using Polymerase Chain Reaction for microbiological analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A split mouth study was conducted, in which a total of 20 subjects were included. Green tea catechin as local drug delivery was placed at study sites. Clinical parameters namely probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) were recorded. Sub-gingival plaque samples were collected, and red complex micro-organisms were studied using PCR. Clinical and microbiological parameters were recorded at baseline, 1(st), and 5(th) week after treatment. RESULTS: The results showed statistically significant difference in PPD, GI, and PI and significant reduction of red complex organisms from baseline to 1(st) week and baseline to 5(th) week in both study and control groups (P < 0.001). Intergroup comparison between study and control group was statistically insignificant for PPD, PI, and GI. A significantly greater reduction in Tannerella forsythus (Tf) at 1(st) week and 5(th) week and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) at 1(st) week was observed in study group when compared to control group. CONCLUSION: Green tea catechin can be used as an effective local drug delivery along with scaling and root planing in treatment of chronic periodontitis."

GTC supplementation significantly attenuated the increased body and liver weights and the elevated serum and liver triglyceride levels. Meanwhile, GTCs increased the PPARγ levels in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SWAT) and decreased the PPARγ levels in visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT). In addition, GTC treatment up-regulated the levels of PPARδ in SWAT, VWAT, and brown adipose tissue and increased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in brown adipose tissue. Our results suggest that GTCs exert their anti-obesity mechanism in part by modulating PPAR signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a block in differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation. FLT3 is a commonly mutated gene found in AML patients. In clinical trials, the presence of a FLT3-ITD mutation significantly correlates with an increased risk of relapse and dismal overall survival. Therefore, activated FLT3 is a promising molecular target for AML therapies. In this study, we have shown that green tea polyphenols including (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) suppress the proliferation of AML cells. Interestingly, EGCG, EGC and ECG showed the inhibition of FLT3 expression in cell lines harboring FLT3 mutations. In the THP-1 cells harboring FLT3 wild-type, EGCG showed the suppression of cell proliferation but did not suppress the expression of FLT3 even at the concentration that suppress 100% cell proliferation. Moreover, EGCG-, EGC-and ECG-treated cells showed the suppression of MAPK, AKT and STAT5 phosphorylation. Altogether, we suggest that green tea polyphenols could serve as reagents for treatment or prevention of leukemia harboring FLT3 mutations.",

Increases in gallic acid (GA), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-)-epicatechin (EC) were observed in the green tea extract after tannase treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to investigate the anti-wrinkle effects of topical applications of green tea extract exhibiting high antioxidant activity after tannase treatment. METHODS: Subjects, randomly divided into two groups, received the application of either tannase-converted green tea extract (TGE) or normal green tea extract (NGE) on their crow's feet for 8 weeks. The anti-wrinkle effects were evaluated with two methods: (i) self-assessment; and (ii) average roughness of skin surface (R(a), R(z), and R(t) value) using skin replica and Skin-Visiometer SV 600. RESULTS: The scavenging abilities of TGE against radicals were significantly higher compared to NGE. The evaluation of skin wrinkle index values after 8 weeks of treatment showed that reductions of R(a), R(z), and R(t) values in the TGE group were significantly greater than in the NGE group, which indicated that tannase treatment improved the anti-wrinkle effects of green tea extract. According to the overall ratings for wrinkle treatment by applying the formulations, most of the TGE group (63.60%) reported marked or moderate improvement in wrinkles compared with only 36.30% of the NGE group. CONCLUSION: Tannase treatment can improve the antioxidant activity of green tea extract, conferring anti-wrinkle activities. These results suggest that TGE may have beneficial properties as an anti-wrinkle agent.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Green tea is a rich source of polyphenols, mainly catechins (flavanols), which significantly contribute to the beneficial health effects of green tea in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. In this study the effects of four green tea catechins on protein ERp57, also known as protein disulfide isomerase isoform A3 (PDIA3), have been investigated in an in vitro model. METHODS: The interaction of catechins with ERp57 was explored by fluorescence quenching and surface plasmon resonance techniques and their effect on ERp57 activities was investigated. RESULTS: A higher affinity was observed for galloylated cathechins, which bind close to the thioredoxin-like redox-sensitive active sites of the protein, with a preference for the oxidized form. The effects of these catechins on ERp57 properties were also investigated and a moderate inhibition of the reductase activity of ERp57 was observed as well as a strong inhibition of ERp57 DNA binding activity. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high affinity of galloylated catechins for ERp57 and their capability to inhibit ERp57 binding to other macromolecular ligands, some effects of catechins interaction with this protein on eukaryotic cells may be expected. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides information to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activities of catechins and to design new polyphenol-based ERp57-specific inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "Polyphenols, including green tea catechins, are secondary plant compounds often discussed in the context of health-promoting potential. Evidence for such effects is mainly derived from epidemiological and cell culture studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate antidiabetic, antiadipogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects at nonpharmacological doses in an obese diabetic mouse model that exerts early relevant clinical signs of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Female db/db mice received a flavonoid-poor diet either without additive, with rosiglitazone (RSG, 0.02 g/kg diet), or with green tea extract (low-dose green tea extract [LGTE] and high-dose green tea extract [HGTE], 0.1 and 1 g/kg diet). Food and water were freely available. The body weight was monitored weekly. Blood was sampled (12-h fasted) from the tail vein on day 28 and analyzed for glucose, cholesterol, triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, adiponectin, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1). Blood glucose was also analyzed on day 14. Furthermore, sICAM-1 release was investigated in tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated EAhy926 cells. After 14 days, fasting glycemia was improved by RSG or HGTE supplementation compared to controls. However, at the end of the study (day 28), only RSG exhibited glucose-lowering effects and induced plasma adiponectin concentrations, paralleled by higher body weight gain and reduced periuterine fat pads compared to controls. However, only GTE treatment reduced sICAM-1 release in vitro and in vivo. Nonpharmacological HGTE supplementation in db/db mice caused (1) no adiponectin-inducing or antiadipogenic effects, (2) reduced sICAM-1 release, thereby potentially exerting anti-inflammatory effects in the progressive diabetic state, and (3) a transient improvement in glycemia.",

The primary objective is to discuss the proposed antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunostimulatory activity of catechins based on strong evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies conducted to date, including two preclinical in vitro studies with sinecatechins, a proprietary mixture of catechins. This review also discusses the clinical implications of catechins for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts (EGWs) and other conditions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). While the MOA of catechins in the treatment of EGWs and other HPV-related conditions may be related to or associated with postulated or proven antiviral and immunostimulatory activity, the precise clinical significance of the various in vitro findings remains largely unknown.",

Many potential mechanisms have been proposed, yet the precise mechanism of lung cancer prevention by green tea catechins remains unclear. microRNAs (miRs) are a class of 21-24 nucleotide small non-coding RNAs and play critical roles throughout cellular development and regulation. Emerging evidence demonstrates that tea catechins influence the expression of miRs in human cancer cells to inhibit tumorigenesis. Both let-7a-1 and let-7g were detected in the human lung cancer cells treated with tea catechins. The cell viability and cell cycle were analyzed after tea catechins treatment. In the present study, we found that tea catechins upregulated the tumor-suppressor miRs, let-7a-1 and let-7g, in lung cancer cell lines. The upregulation of let-7a/7g repressed the expression of their targets, C-MYC and the regulatory protein of LIN-28, at the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the cell growth assay indicated that tea catechins significantly inhibited cell proliferation, and the flow cytometric analysis revealed an increase in the number of cells in the G2/M phase and a decrease in the number of cells in the S phase after treatment with tea catechins. These observations suggest that green tea catechins mediate the inhibition of proliferation of lung cancer cells through the let-7 signaling pathway."

METHODS: A total of 128 women aged over 75 years were defined as sarcopenic and randomly assigned into four groups: exercise and tea catechin supplementation (n = 32), exercise (n = 32), tea catechin supplementation (n = 32) or health education (n = 32). The exercise group attended a 60-min comprehensive training program twice a week and the tea catechin supplementation group ingested 350 mL of a tea beverage fortified with catechin daily for 3 months. Body composition was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Interview data and functional fitness measurements, such as muscle strength, balance and walking ability, were collected at baseline and after the 3-month intervention. RESULTS: There were significant group × time interactions observed in timed up & go (P < 0.001), usual walking speed (P = 0.007) and maximum walking speed (P < 0.001). The exercise + catechin group showed a significant effect (odds ratio 3.61, 95% confidence interval 1.05-13.66) for changes in the combined variables of leg muscle mass and usual walking speed compared with the health education group. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of exercise and tea catechin supplementation had a beneficial effect on physical function measured by walking ability and muscle mass.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Ovary hormone deficiency and the age-related changes in post-menopausal women are subjected to a number of urological dysfunctions, including overactive bladder syndrome. Green tea is a popular healthy drink worldwide and its extract catechin has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. EGCG, the major type of catechin, is an antioxidant polyphenol flavonoid isolated from green tea. EGCG supplement could prevent ovariectomy-induced bladder dysfunction in a dose-related manner through its anti-oxidant, anti-fibrosis and anti-apoptosis effects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether green tea extract, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), could prevent ovariectomy-induced overactive bladder (OAB) and to investigate its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrosis effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 48 female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. After bilateral ovariectomy, the first group served as the ovariectomy control, the second group received EGCG 1 µM/kg daily i.p. injection after ovariectomy surgery, and the third group received EGCG 10 µM/kg daily i.p. injection. The fourth group was taken as the sham without ovariectomy surgery. The rats were killed after 6 months after ovariectomy surgery. Cystometrograms were performed for the measure of bladder overactivity. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay was used to evaluate apoptotic cells. Western immunoblots were performed to determine the expressions of inflammatory markers, apoptosis-associated proteins and oxidative stress markers. RESULTS: Long-term ovariectomy significantly increased non-voiding contractions and decreased bladder compliance. Treatment with EGCG significantly increased bladder compliance and diminished non-voiding contractions. Ovariectomy significantly increased apoptotic cells and enhanced interstitial fibrosis in bladders. The expression of caspase-3 significantly increased, while that of Bcl-2 notably decreased after ovariectomy. Inflammatory and fibrosis markers, TGF-β, fibronectin and type I collagen expressions were significantly increased after 6 months of ovariectomy surgery. Treatment with EGCG significantly decreased TGF-β and type I collagen expressions. Oxidative stress markers, nitrotyrosine and protein carbonylation levels were significantly increased in the ovariectomy group. EGCG could attenuate this oxidative damage in dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Ovariectomy increased oxidative damage, enhanced voiding frequency and decreased bladder compliance. EGCG could restore ovariectomy-induced bladder dysfunction in a dose-dependent fashion through antioxidant, anti-fibrosis and anti-apoptosis effects.",

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of TC on antioxidant status of hepatocytes challenged with H2 O2 . Primary hepatocytes of goat were exposed to 1 mm H2 O2 without or with 5, 50 and 500 μg/ml TC. The cells were harvested at 48 h post-treatment to determine effects of TC on proliferation, apoptotic features and membrane integrity of cells, and expression of genes and activities of antioxidant enzymes. H2 O2 exposure caused damage to cells (p < 0.001). A lower concentration of TC (5 μg/ml) displayed a protective effect by inhibiting exorbitant cell proliferation and DNA degradation. Both H2 O2 exposure and TC pre-incubation affected expression of antioxidant enzymes at mRNA and protein levels (p < 0.001). The activities of catalase (CAT) (p = 0.027), CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) (p < 0.001) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (p < 0.001) increased with TC pre-incubation followed by H2 O2 challenge. Changes of CuZn-SOD activity induced by H2 O2 and TC basically paralleled the changes in the corresponding mRNA and protein levels, but the correlation in CAT and GPx expression displayed slightly different patterns at different concentrations of TC. These findings infer that oxidative stress can induce deleterious cellular responses and this unfavourable condition may be alleviated by treatment with TC.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A rat model of ovariectomy-induced voiding dysfunction has been established, which mimicked the urge incontinence in postmenopausal women. Previous studies have identified strong anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties of green tea and its associated polyphenols. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the green tea extract, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), could prevent an ovariectomy-induced overactive bladder. METHODS: The study included 48 female Sprague-Dawley rats, which were divided into four groups. After bilateral ovariectomy during the following 6-month period, 12 rats received an intraperitoneal injection of saline, 24 rats received either a low-dose (1 μM kg(-1) d(-1)) or a high-dose (10 μM kg(-1) d(-1)) EGCG intraperitoneal injection. The sham group consisted of twelve rats that were not ovariectomized. In vivo isovolumetric cystometrograms were performed in all groups before the animals were euthanized. The immunofluorescence study used neurofilament stains to evaluate intramural nerve damage. Western immunoblots and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine M2 and M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptors (MChRs) at both protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions. RESULTS: Long-term ovariectomy significantly increased non-voiding contractions, whereas treatment with EGCG significantly attenuated the frequency of non-voiding contractions. Ovariectomy significantly decreased the numbers of neurofilament and increased M2 and M3 MChR protein and mRNA expressions. Treatment with EGCG restored the amount of neurofilament staining and decreased M2 and M3 MChR protein and mRNA overexpressions. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that ovary hormone deficiency induced overactive bladder dysfunction via intramural nerve damage and muscarinic receptor overexpression. EGCG prevented ovariectomy-induced bladder dysfunction through neuroprotective effects in a dose-dependent fashion.",

      "abstract": "Melanoma is the most serious type of skin disease and a leading cause of death from skin disease due to its highly metastatic ability. To develop more effective chemopreventive agents for the prevention of melanoma, we have determined the effect of green tea catechins on the invasive potential of human melanoma cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects using A375 (BRAF-mutated) and Hs294t (Non-BRAF-mutated) melanoma cell lines as an in vitro model. Employing cell invasion assays, we found that the inhibitory effects of green tea catechins on the cell migration were in the order of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)>(-)-epigallocatechin>(-)-epicatechin-3-gallate>(-)-gallocatechin>(-)-epicatechin. Treatment of A375 and Hs294t cells with EGCG resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell migration or invasion of these cells, which was associated with a reduction in the levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, prostaglandin (PG) E(2) and PGE(2) receptors (EP2 and EP4). Treatment of cells with celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, also inhibited melanoma cell migration. EGCG inhibits 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-, an inducer of COX-2, and PGE(2)-induced cell migration of cells. EGCG decreased EP2 agonist (butaprost)- and EP4 agonist (Cay10580)-induced cell migration ability. Moreover, EGCG inhibited the activation of NF-κB/p65, an upstream regulator of COX-2, in A375 melanoma cells, and treatment of cells with caffeic acid phenethyl ester, an inhibitor of NF-κB, also inhibited cell migration. Inhibition of melanoma cell migration by EGCG was associated with transition of mesenchymal stage to epithelial stage, which resulted in an increase in the levels of epithelial biomarkers (E-cadherin, cytokeratin and desmoglein 2) and a reduction in the levels of mesenchymal biomarkers (vimentin, fibronectin and N-cadherin) in A375 melanoma cells. Together, these results indicate that EGCG, a major green tea catechin, has the ability to inhibit melanoma cell invasion/migration, an essential step of metastasis, by targeting the endogenous expression of COX-2, PGE(2) receptors and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.",

Cells were harvested at 48 h postincubation with TCs to investigate the effects of TCs on cell proliferation, cell membrane integrity, antioxidant enzyme activities, and antioxidant enzyme genes and protein expression levels. Results showed that H(2)O(2) induction inhibited cell proliferation with or without TC incubation; moreover, the inhibition effect was enhanced in the presence of TCs (P < 0.001). H(2)O(2)-induced stress increased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the absence or presence of TC incubation, but concentrations of TCs, less than 5 μg/mL, showed protective functions against LDH leakage than in other H(2)O(2)-induced treatments. The catalase (CAT) activity increased when SMCs were stress induced with H(2)O(2) in the absence or presence of TC incubation (P < 0.001). H(2)O(2)-induced stress decreased CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, whereas this effect was prevented by incubation with TCs in a concentration-dependent manner. H(2)O(2)-induced stress with or without TC incubation had significant effects on mRNA and protein expression levels of CAT, CuZn-SOD, and GPx (P < 0.001). CAT and CuZn-SOD mRNA expression levels were increased by different concentrations of TC incubation, and this tendency was basically consistent with corresponding protein expression levels. The GPx mRNA expression level increased with a low concentration of TCs but decreased with concentrations greater than 5 μg/mL of TCs, whereas GPx protein expression in all TC-incubated groups was lower than in the control treatment. The current findings imply that TCs had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and enhanced damage to the cell membrane integrity, but TCs affected antioxidant status in SMCs by modulating antioxidant enzyme activities at mRNA and protein expression levels.",

In the present study we investigated the health effects of dietary supplementation with green tea catechins and the potential modifying effect of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val/Met genotype. Subjects (sedentary males, aged 40-69 years, with BMI ≥ 28 and ≤ 38 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to consume decaffeinated green tea extract (DGT; 530 mg containing about 400 mg total catechins/capsule, twice daily) and placebo in a complete cross-over design. Ambulatory blood pressure and biomarkers of metabolic function (cholesterol, TAG, glucose and insulin) were measured at weeks 0 and 6. Although a marked increase in the concentration of plasma epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), urinary epigallocatechin (EGC) and urinary 4'-O-methyl EGC was found after DGT treatment, no effect on blood pressure or biomarkers of metabolic function was observed. However, a period × treatment interaction (P < 0·05) was detected for body-weight change. Despite a similar increase in estimated energy intake during intervention period 1, body weight decreased by 0·64 (sd 2·2) kg and increased by 0·53 (sd 1·9) kg in the DGT and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0·025), suggesting a protective effect of green tea catechins on weight gain. Additionally, the COMT Val/Met genotype influenced urinary accumulation of EGC and 4'-O-methyl EGC (P < 0·01). Mean concentrations were lower in individuals homozygous for the high-activity G-allele, possibly reflecting increased metabolic flux and a more rapid conversion to downstream metabolic species, compared with individuals carrying at least one copy of the low-activity A-allele. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and further explore the modifying effect of genotype.",

This study was conducted to determine whether taking green tea catechins and theanine can clinically prevent influenza infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 200 healthcare workers conducted for 5 months from November 9, 2009 to April 8, 2010 in three healthcare facilities for the elderly in Higashimurayama, Japan. INTERVENTIONS: The catechin/theanine group received capsules including green tea catechins (378 mg/day) and theanine (210 mg/day). The control group received placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of clinically defined influenza infection. Secondary outcomes were (1) laboratory-confirmed influenza with viral antigen measured by immunochromatographic assay and (2) the time for which the patient was free from clinically defined influenza infection, i.e., the period between the start of intervention and the first diagnosis of influenza infection, based on clinically defined influenza infection. RESULTS: Eligible healthcare workers (n = 197) were enrolled and randomly assigned to an intervention; 98 were allocated to receive catechin/theanine capsules and 99 to placebo. The incidence of clinically defined influenza infection was significantly lower in the catechin/theanine group (4 participants; 4.1%) compared with the placebo group (13 participants; 13.1%) (adjusted OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.76, P = 0.022). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection was also lower in the catechin/theanine group (1 participant; 1.0%) than in the placebo group (5 participants; 5.1%), but this difference was not significant (adjusted OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.01 to 1.10; P = 0.112). The time for which the patient was free from clinically defined influenza infection was significantly different between the two groups (adjusted HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.84; P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Among healthcare workers for the elderly, taking green tea catechins and theanine may be effective prophylaxis for influenza infection.

However, their anti-inflammatory effect and a feasible mechanism in haemorrhage/resuscitation (H/R)-induced liver injury remain unknown. We investigated the effects of GTE and the role of NF-κB in the pathogenesis of liver injury induced by H/R, and their effects on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and neutrophil infiltration. Female Lewis rats were fed a standard chow diet (control, ctrl) or a diet containing 0·1 % polyphenolic GTE for five consecutive days before H/R. Rats were haemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 30 (sem 2) mmHg for 60 min and resuscitated. Control groups (sham_ctrl and sham_GTE) underwent surgical procedures without H/R. At 2 h after resuscitation, tissues were harvested. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and IL-6 were measured. Hepatic necrosis, ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMNL) infiltration were assessed. Hepatic expression of IκBα (phospho) was measured. H/R induced strong liver damage with increased necrosis and serum ALT levels. Compared with both sham groups, inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and hepatic PMNL infiltration) were elevated after H/R (P < 0·05). Also, H/R increased IκBα phosphorylation. GTE administration markedly (P < 0·05) decreased serum ALT and IL-6 levels, hepatic necrosis as well as PMNL infiltration and the expression of ICAM-1 and phosphorylated IκBα compared with H/R. In conclusion, we observed that NF-κB activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of liver injury after H/R through the up-regulation of hepatic ICAM-1 expression and subsequent PMNL infiltration. GTE pre-treatment prevents liver damage in this model of acute inflammation through a NF-κB-dependent mechanism.",

Current treatments are unsatisfactory. Green tea sinecatechin Polyphenon E ointment is a botanical extract from green tea leaves exhibiting anti-oxidant, anti-viral and anti-tumour properties. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to integrate valid information and provide basis for rational decision making regarding efficacy and safety of green tea extracts in the treatment of EGWs. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases was conducted using specific key terms. Main search was performed independently by two reviewers. The accumulated relevant literature was subsequently systematically reviewed and a meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating efficacy and safety of Polyphenon E 15% and 10% in the treatment of warts were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 660 men and 587 women were enrolled. Regarding primary outcome, both Polyphenon E 15% and 10% demonstrated significantly higher likelihood of complete clearance of baseline and baseline and new warts compared with controls. No significant heterogeneity was detected. Recurrence rates were very low. Commonest local skin sign was erythema and local skin symptom was itching. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of Polyphenon 15% and 10%, at least for the primary endpoint, is clearly indicated. Polyphenon E treatment exhibits very low recurrence rates and appears to have a rather favourable safety and tolerability profile. Recommendations for future studies should include evaluation of the efficacy of green tea catechins in the treatment of internal anogenital warts and direct comparison with its principal comparator, imiquimod.",

      "abstract": "Green tea is now recognized as the most effective cancer preventive beverage. In one study, 10 Japanese-size cups of green tea daily supplemented with tablets of green tea extract limited the recurrence of colorectal polyps in humans to 50%. Thus, cancer patients who consume green tea and take anticancer drugs will have double prevention. We studied the effects of combining (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and anticancer drugs, focusing on inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Numerous anticancer drugs, such as tamoxifen, COX-2 inhibitors, and retinoids were used for the experiments, and the combination of EGCG and COX-2 inhibitors consistently induced the enhancement of apoptosis. To study the mechanism of the enhancement, we paid special attention to the enhanced expressions of DDIT3 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 153, GADD153), GADD45A, and CDKN1A (p21/WAF1/CIP1) genes, based on our previous evidence that a combination of EGCG and sulindac specifically induced upregulated expression of GADD153 and p21 genes in PC-9 lung cancer cells. The synergistic enhancements of apoptosis and GADD153 gene expression in human non-small cell lung cancer cells by the combination of EGCG and celecoxib were mediated through the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This article reviews the synergistic enhancement of apoptosis, gene expression, and anticancer effects using various combinations of EGCG and anticancer drugs, including the combination of (-)-epicatechin (EC) and curcumin. Based on the evidence, we present a new concept: green tea catechins as synergists with anticancer drugs.",

Results from a number of randomized, controlled intervention trials have shown that consumption of GTC (270 mg to 1200 mg/day) may reduce body weight and fat. There are several proposed mechanisms whereby GTC may influence body weight and composition. The predominating hypothesis is that GTC influences sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, increasing energy expenditure and promoting the oxidation of fat. Caffeine, naturally present in green tea, also influences SNS activity, and may act synergistically with GTC to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Other potential mechanisms include modifications in appetite, up-regulation of enzymes involved in hepatic fat oxidation, and decreased nutrient absorption. This article reviews the evidence for each of these purported mechanisms, with particular reference to studies in humans.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: this study examined the effects of a dentifrice containing green tea catechins on gingival oxidative stress and periodontal inflammation using a rat model. DESIGN: twenty-four male Wister rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group (Control group) received no treatment for 8 weeks. Periodontal inflammation was induced in the second group for 8 weeks. Periodontal inflammation was induced in the last two groups for 8 weeks and dentifrices with or without green tea catechins were topically applied to the gingival sulcus daily for 4 weeks prior to the end of the experimental period. RESULTS: rats that had experimental periodontal inflammation showed apical migration of the junctional epithelium, alveolar bone loss and inflammatory cell infiltration in the connective tissue subjacent to the junctional epithelium at 8 weeks, whilst the control group showed no pathologic changes. Topical application of a green tea catechin-containing dentifrice reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in the periodontal lesions to a greater degree than the control dentifrice at 8 weeks. The gingiva in which green tea catechin-containing dentifrice was applied also showed a lower level of expression of hexanoyl-lysine (a marker of lipid peroxidation), nitrotyrosine (a marker of oxidative protein damage), and tumour necrosis factor-α (an indicator of pro-inflammatory cytokines) at 8 weeks compared to gingiva in which the control dentifrice was applied. CONCLUSIONS: adding green tea catechins to a dentifrice may contribute to prevention of periodontal inflammation by decreasing gingival oxidative stress and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

RTKs have emerged as molecular targets for the treatment of various cancers. Green tea and its polyphenolic compounds, the catechins, exhibit chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties in many human cancer cell types, as well as in various carcinogenicity models in vivo. Epidemiological studies are somewhat less convincing, but some positive correlations have been observed. The tea catechins, including (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), have pleiotropic effects on cellular proteins and signaling pathways. This review focuses on the ability of the tea constituents to suppress RTK signaling, and summarizes the mechanisms by which EGCG and other catechins might exert their protective effects towards dysregulated RTKs in cancer cells. The findings are discussed in the context of ongoing clinical trials with RTK inhibitors, and the possibility for drug/nutrient interactions enhancing therapeutic efficacy.",

In the brain, this vicious cycle is more severe as brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. In our study, 14-month-old female C57BL/6J mice were orally administered 0.05% green tea catechins (GTC, w/v) in drinking water for 6 months. We found that GTC supplementation prevented the decrease in total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in serum as well as reduced the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and protein carbonyl contents in the hippocampus of aged mice. The activation of transcriptional factor nuclear factor-kappa B and lipofuscin formation in pyramidal cells of hippocampal CA1 region, which are all related to oxidative stress, was also reduced after GTC treatment. We also found that long-term GTC treatment prevented age-related reductions of two representative post-synaptic proteins post-synaptic density 95 and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 1 in the hippocampus. These results demonstrated that chronic 0.05% green tea catechins administration may prevent oxidative stress related brain aging in female C57BL/6J mice.",

      "abstract": "Green tea catechins have been reported to have antitumor activity. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of catechins on the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX) in a murine model for chemoresistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) are the most abundant polyphenolic compounds in green tea. Here, we show that ECG or EGCG at higher doses had a slight inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in the resistant human HCC cell line BEL-7404/DOX in vitro and in vivo, whereas the administration of DOX with these compounds at lower doses significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation in vitro and hepatoma growth in a xenograft mouse model, compared with treatment with either agent alone at the same dose. Furthermore, the administration of DOX in combination with ECG or EGCG markedly enhanced intracellular DOX accumulation, which implies that the catechins inhibited P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump activity. Consistent with these results, the intracellular retention of rhodamine 123, a P-gp substrate, was increased and the level of P-gp was decreased in cells concurrently treated with DOX and ECG or EGCG. EGCG increased topo II expression, but did not alter GST protein levels in tumor xenografts. The expression of MDR1 and HIF-1alpha mRNA was obviously reduced, whereas MRP1 and LRP expression was not changed significantly. These data suggest that tea catechins at non-toxic doses can augment DOX-induced cell killing and sensitize chemoresistant HCC cells to DOX. The chemosensitizing effect of catechins may occur directly or indirectly by reversal of multidrug resistance, involving the suppression of MDR1 expression, or by enhancement of intracellular DOX accumulation, involving inhibition of P-gp function.",

Proliferation indices and apoptotic indices were determined by PCNA immunostaining and TUNEL assay, respectively. The results showed that dietary curcumin, catechins and combination administration significantly inhibited the total number of ACF per rat. The combination treatment displayed the most potent inhibitory effect, while there was no difference of inhibition between curcumin and catechins-treated groups. The incidence of colorectal cancer in the treated groups was significantly lower than that of positive control group. Compared with the positive control group, the proliferation index was significantly decreased and the apoptotic index was significantly increased in all treatment groups, while the effect of the combination was the greatest among the treated groups.

Molecular signaling pathways of catechin-induced apoptosis were analyzed using Human signal transduction RT(2) Profiler PCR array (SuperArray). Compared to control-treated cells, treatment with catechin agents significantly suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent fashion (P < 0.01), with strongest effects evoked by ECG and EGCG in UROtsa cells, ECG in low-grade RT4 and SW780 cells, and PP-60 and EGCG in high-grade TCCSUP and T24 cells.

The objective of the present study was to examine the separate and combined effects of different catechins and caffeine on energy expenditure (EE) and fat oxidation over a single day. Fifteen healthy, normal-weight males received capsules containing placebo, caffeine alone (150 mg), or caffeine plus a catechin mixture (600 mg) enriched in either epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin or a mix of catechins, in a randomised cross-over double-blinded design. On each test day EE, respiratory quotient (RQ) and substrate oxidation were measured under sedentary conditions in a respiratory chamber for 13.5 h. We found no significant treatment effect on EE (P = 0.20) or RQ (P = 0.68). EGCG with caffeine insignificantly raised EE and fat oxidation v. caffeine-only and placebo (EE 5.71 (SE 0.12) v. 5.68 (SE 0.14) v. 5.59 (SE 0.13) MJ/12.5 h, respectively; fat oxidation 84.8 (SE 5.2) v. 80.7 (SE 4.7) v. 76.8 (SE 4.0) g/12.5 h). Catechin/caffeine combinations at these dosages and mode of application had non-significant acute effects on EE and fat oxidation. The maximum observed effect on EE of about 2 % could still be meaningful for energy balance over much longer period of exposure. However, higher short-term effects reported in the literature may reflect variations in green tea extracts, added caffeine, or synergies with physical activity. The specific mechanisms and conditions that may underpin observed longer-term benefits of catechin-enriched green tea consumption on body composition remain to be confirmed.",

Our microarray data showed that the green tea component epicatechin-3-gallate suppressed NUDT6 expression, and this was confirmed by RT-PCR. Subsequently, the use of different catechins showed that the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was stronger than that of other catechins. At the posttranscriptional level, EGCG decreased the RNA stability of NUDT6, indicating it as a potential mechanism of NUDT6 suppression. Further cloning of the 3' untranslated region of human NUDT6 mRNA resulted in reduced luciferase activity by EGCG treatment. This effect was at least, in part, mediated by the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and p38MAPK pathways. Finally, increased cell proliferation and cell growth in soft agar were observed in NUDT6-overexpressing cells. These findings provide a novel mechanism for the suppression of the proliferative gene NUDT6 by green tea catechins in human colorectal cancer.",

There is conclusive evidence from in vitro and animal studies which provide the concepts for underlying functional mechanisms of green tea catechins and their biological actions. An increasing number of human studies have explored the effects of green tea catechins on the major MetS conditions such as obesity, type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the human studies addressing the potential benefits of green tea catechins on the MetS. The number of human studies in this field is still limited. However, the majority of human epidemiological and intervention studies demonstrate beneficial effects of green tea or green tea extracts, rich in EGCG on weight management, glucose control and cardiovascular risk factors. The optimal dose has not yet been established. The current body of evidence in humans warrants further attention. In particular, well-controlled long-term human studies would help to fully understand the protective effects of green tea catechins on parameters related to the MetS.",

      "abstract": "Current therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer and Parkinson disease (AD and PD, respectively) are merely symptomatic, intended for the treatment of symptoms, but offer only partial benefit, without any disease-modifying activity. Novel promising strategies suggest the use of antiinflammatory drugs, antioxidants, iron-complexing molecules, neurotrophic factor delivery, inhibitors of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)-processing secretases, gamma and beta (that generate the amyloid-beta peptides, Abeta), anti-Abeta aggregation molecules, the interference with lipid cholesterol metabolism and naturally occurring plant flavonoids to potentially reverse the course of the diseases. Human epidemiological and new animal data suggest that tea drinking may decrease the incidence of dementia, AD, and PD. In particular, its main catechin polyphenol constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been shown to exert neuroprotective/neurorescue activities in a wide array of cellular and animal models of neurological disorders. In the current article, we review the literature on the impact of the multimodal activities of green tea polyphenols and their neuroprotective effect on AD and PD.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies have established a positive correlation between green tea consumption and cardiovascular health. Catechins, the major polyphenolic compounds in green tea, exert vascular protective effects through multiple mechanisms, including antioxidative, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-thrombogenic, and lipid lowering effects. (1) Tea catechins present antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals, chelating redox active transition-metal ions, inhibiting redox active transcription factors, inhibiting pro-oxidant enzymes and inducing antioxidant enzymes. (2) Tea catechins inhibit the key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and reduce intestinal lipid absorption, thereby improving blood lipid profile. (3) Catechins regulate vascular tone by activating endothelial nitric oxide. (4) Catechins prevent vascular inflammation that plays a critical role in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. The anti-inflammatory activities of catechins may be due to their suppression of leukocyte adhesion to endothelium and subsequent transmigration through inhibition of transcriptional factor NF-kB-mediated production of cytokines and adhesion molecules both in endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. (5) Catechins inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by interfering with vascular cell growth factors involved in atherogenesis. (6) Catechins suppress platelet adhesion, thereby inhibiting thrombogenesis. Taken together, catechins may be novel plant-derived small molecules for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights current developments in green tea extracts and vascular health, focusing specifically on the role of tea catechins in the prevention of various vascular diseases and the underlying mechanisms for these actions. In addition, the possible structure-activity relationship of catechins is discussed.",

A recent large epidemiological study in Japan demonstrates that increased tea consumption is associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality (but not cancer mortality) in a dose-dependent manner. The polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant tea catechin. Beneficial effects of EGCG therapy have been reported in a number of human and animal studies. Emerging evidence suggests that EGCG may improve endothelial function, hypertension, coronary heart disease, obesity, insulin resistance, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. Studies in cultured cells and animal models suggest molecular mechanisms for EGCG to activate specific cellular signaling pathways that may play major roles in prevention and amelioration of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In this review, the beneficial health effects of tea and molecular mechanisms of EGCG related to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases will be discussed.",

Male BrlHan:WIST@Jcl (GALAS) rats were given N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN), N-methylnitrosourea (MNU), 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) and 2,2'-dihydroxy-di-n-propylnitrosamine (DHPN) for a total multiple initiation period of 4 weeks (DMBDD treatment). Rats were then given a diet containing copper gluconate at a concentration of 0, 10, 300, 3000 or 6000 ppm with or without a co-administration of catechins starting 1 week later by admixing in the drinking water at a concentration of 5000 ppm. All survivors were sacrificed at the end of week 29. Number of putatively preneoplastic, glutathione S-transferase placental form-positive, liver lesions significantly increased by copper gluconate of 300 ppm or greater. In addition, both incidence and grade of hyperplasia in the forestomach significantly increased by copper gluconate of 6000 ppm. Catechins, exerting no effects by themselves, inhibited these effects of copper gluconate. The present results indicate that copper gluconate may possess carcinogenic risks for the liver and forestomach at its high dose level, and that co-administered green tea catechins may exert preventive effects.",

      "abstract": "The beneficial health effects associated with drinking green tea are widely considered to be due primarily to tea catechins. Heat treatment of marketed green tea beverages for sterilization causes epimerization and/or polymerization of tea catechins. Safety studies on heat-treated tea catechins are limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate potential adverse effects, if any, of two standardized green tea catechin (GTC) preparations: one that underwent heat sterilization (GTC-H) and one that was not heat-sterilized (GTC-UH). A decaffeinated preparation of the GTC-H (GTC-HDC) was also evaluated to ascertain if any effects were due to caffeine. The GTC preparations were administered to rats once daily at levels up to 2000 mg/kg/day for 28 days. There were no deaths attributable to the GTC preparations. The clinical condition of the animals, functional observational battery, motor activity, clinical pathology evaluations, organ weights, and gross necropsy findings were unaffected by any of the GTC preparations. GTC-HDC or GTC-UH dosing had no effects on body weights or microscopic findings, whereas lower body weights and food consumption were observed in the 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day GTC-H group males. The no observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for localized gastric effects for GTC-H was 1000 mg/kg/day. No other target organs were identified. Thus, the NOAEL for systemic toxicity following oral administration was 2000 mg/kg/day for GTC-H, GTC HDC, and GTC-UH under the conditions of this study.",
