      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a key clinical condition that has puzzled clinicians for many years since there is currently no efficient drug therapy. Vitamin E is found to exert a vital antioxidant role and can protect the kidney. However, clinical studies that analyze the correlation between vitamin E and AKI are scarce, and no consistent conclusions are reported from current studies. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the impact of vitamin E on treating AKI. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were comprehensively searched on 27 December 2023. Qualified studies were selected following the eligibility criteria. The incidence of AKI, serum creatinine, and urea nitrogen levels after vitamin E treatment were evaluated. Then, the data were combined with a fixed- or random-effects model, depending on the heterogeneity test results. RESULTS: Six eligible randomized controlled trials that used vitamin E for the prevention of kidney injury were included. According to our pooled analysis, vitamin E elevated eGFR levels [MD: 0.36; 95% CI (0.19, 0.53), p = 0.000], reduced serum creatinine levels [MD: -0.32; 95% CI (-0.48, 0.16), p = 0.000], and effectively inhibited the occurrence of AKI [RR: 0.69; 95% CI (0.49, 0.98), p = 0.036]. CONCLUSION: Vitamin E elevates eGFR levels, reduces serum creatinine levels, and efficiently suppresses AKI occurrence.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Ovariectomized rodents experience metabolic dysfunction in whole-body and skeletal muscle. A disrupted balance between oxidative stress and antioxidants might exacerbate metabolic dysfunction in ovariectomized rodents. Dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin E intake, before or during exercise would be beneficial by mitigating the exercise-induced increase in oxidative stress in ovariectomized rodents. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the potential effect of vitamin E intake combined with voluntary exercise on whole-body and skeletal muscle metabolism in ovariectomized mice. Methods: This study used C57BL/6J wild-type female mice (n = 40, 8 weeks old), which were randomly assigned into sham (SHM), ovariectomy (OVX), ovariectomy with exercise (OVXVE), ovariectomy with vitamin E (OVXV), ovariectomy with exercise and vitamin E (OVXVE) groups. Body composition, resting metabolic rate, glucose tolerance, skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, and protein contents were assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, indirect calorimetry, glucose tolerance test, O2K OROBOROS, and Western blot, respectively. Results: The combined treatment of vitamin E and voluntary wheel running did not show a beneficial effect on whole-body metabolism such as fat mass, energy expenditure, and glucose tolerance. However, independent of exercise intervention, vitamin E intake enhanced mitochondrial function, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1-a), and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels and also reduced oxidative stress in the skeletal muscles of ovariectomized mice. Specifically, in the soleus muscle, vitamin E intake enhanced mitochondrial function and PGC1-a content (p < 0.05). In the gastrocnemius muscle, vitamin E intake enhanced PGC1-a and AMPK levels and reduced a marker of oxidative stress (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Vitamin E, as a potent antioxidant, may play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal muscle health in ovariectomized mice. More studies are necessary to investigate whether this finding is applicable to women.",

      "abstract": "In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, two vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, as treatments for tardive dyskinesia (TD). Additionally, some trials have suggested that vitamin E may benefit TD patients. However, the mechanistic basis for these treatments remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the mechanisms of valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, and vitamin E in TD treatment utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches. Putative target genes associated with valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, and vitamin E were retrieved from the PharmMapper, CTD, GeneCards, SwissTargetPrediction, and DrugBank databases. TD-related targets were identified using the GeneCards, DisGeNET, OMIM, and TTD databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created to identify core targets. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted via DAVID, and Cytoscape was used to build a drug-pathway-target-disease network. Molecular docking evaluated drug-target interactions. A total of 32, 36, and 62 targets relevant to the treatment of TD were identified for valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, and vitamin E, respectively. PPI and KEGG pathway analyses suggested that valbenazine and deutetrabenazine may influence TD through the dopaminergic synapse signaling pathway via common core targets (e.g., Dopamine Receptor D1 (DRD1), DRD2, Monoamine Oxidase B (MAOB), Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 3 (SLC6A3), SLC18A2) and specific targets (DRD3 for valbenazine, MAOA for deutetrabenazine). Vitamin E may affect TD by targeting the PI3K-Akt pathway through AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (AKT1), Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Insulin (INS), Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 (NOS3), and Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4). This study provides insights into the common and unique molecular mechanisms by which valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, and vitamin E may treat TD. Pharmacological experiments should be conducted to verify and further explore these results. The findings offer a theoretical basis for further pharmacological investigation and a resource for TD drug screening."

      "abstract": "The pathway of testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury (TIRI) has been shown to involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the ischemic phase and later phase of reperfusion. This study was therefore designed to investigate the effect of blockage of ROS in the ischemic and reperfusion phases of TIRI. Thirty male Wistar rats were grouped into five groups (n = 6 rats each): sham, torsion + detorsion (TD), febuxostat (FEB)-administered (TFD) group, vitamin E (V)-administered (TDV) group, and FEB and vitamin E-administered (TFDV) group. Blood samples (for inflammatory and hormonal assay), testicular (for oxidative stress and histopathology), and epididymal (for sperm DNA damage and indices) tissues were collected after 3 days of detorsion. The TFD and TFDV groups showed a significant reduction in XO and MDA (p < 0.001; η2 > 0.7), as well as a concomitant increase in CAT, thiols, and SOD levels when compared with the TD group (p < 0.01, η2 > 0.5). The TFD group significantly reduced all inflammatory markers (p < 0.05; η2 = 0.75). The observed increase (p < 0.05; η2 = 0.92) in LH level, in response to a low level of testosterone in the TD group, was significantly raised in TFD and TFDV groups. The observed decrease (p < 0.001) in inhibin level in the TD group was raised (p < 0.05; η2 = 0.90) in the TDV group only. A significant increase (p < 0.001) in sperm DNA damage in the TD group was significantly reduced (p < 0.05; η2 = 0.88) in all the treatment groups while the reduced sperm viability (p < 0.01) in the TD group was increased (p < 0.05) in the TFDV group only. There was an improvement in the testicular cytoarchitecture in the TFD and TFDV groups. This study showed that sequential administration of febuxostat in the ischemic phase of TT and vitamin E in the later phase of reperfusion protects the testes against TIRI via inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and sperm DNA damage."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common comorbidity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with shared pathophysiological mechanisms, including insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the effects of vitamin E and ertugliflozin, individually and in combination, alongside standard pioglitazone therapy, on hepatic and metabolic parameters in patients with NAFLD and T2DM. METHODS: A 24-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial on 173 patients with NAFLD and T2DM was assigned into four groups: vitamin E (n = 42), pioglitazone (n = 43), ertugliflozin (n = 44), and vitamin E + ertugliflozin (n = 44) combination therapy. The primary outcome was to monitor changes in liver steatosis assessed via ultrasound. Secondary outcomes included evaluation of liver enzymes, glycemic control, fibrosis markers, and lipid profiles. RESULTS: Combination therapy of vitamin E + ertugliflozin showed the highest decrease in liver fat content, with 11 participants achieving successful Grade 0 (p < 0.001). Significant improvements were also observed in glycemic control, HbA1c, triglycerides, and liver enzymes. Ertugliflozin monotherapy showed significant efficacy in improving liver enzymes, glycemic parameters, and fibrosis markers. Pioglitazone improved the initial stage of NAFLD but had a limited impact on advanced fibrosis. Ertugliflozin, in combination with vitamin E, decreases oxidative stress; however, vitamin E by itself has no impact on the metabolic and fibrosis index. CONCLUSION: The ertugliflozin and vitamin E combination is a very effective treatment for patients with NAFLD and T2DM. It improves hepatic steatosis and metabolic indicators. Exploration is required for combination therapy in order to assess the prolonged efficacy and safety of the treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wound healing is a complex process involving inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Aloe vera and vitamin E (Evion®) are well-known for their wound-healing properties because of their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and collagen-promoting effects. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of A. vera leaf extract, vitamin E, and their combined application on wound healing in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). METHODS: Twenty male rabbits were divided into four groups: control (treated with saline), A. Vera, vitamin E, and combined (A. Vera + vitamin E). Full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of each rabbit, and treatments were applied daily for 14 days. Wound closure rates were measured on days 0, 4, 7, 10, and 14, followed by histopathological and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: By day 14, the combined treatment group demonstrated the most significant wound closure, reducing the wound area by 75% compared with 50% in the A. Vera group, 55% in the vitamin E group, and 35% in the control group. Histopathological analysis showed near-complete re-epithelialization, dense granulation tissue, and enhanced collagen deposition in the combined treatment group. The biochemical results indicated that the hydroxyproline levels were highest in the combined group (6.0 mg/g tissue) and that the antioxidant enzyme activity was elevated. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a synergistic effect between A. Vera and vitamin E, leading to accelerated wound healing and improved tissue repair. The combination treatment has the potential to be a superior therapeutic approach for wound management.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Nicotine, a well-known neurotoxin, induces oxidative stress in fetal tissues, leading to organ damage and fetal growth retardation. This study aims to evaluate oxidative stress parameters in the brain tissue of rat offspring exposed to perinatal nicotine and assess vitamin E's protective effects. METHODS: Twenty-five pregnant rats were administered 10 mg/L of nicotine and 300 mg/L of Vitamin E in drinking water starting from the first day of gestation. On gestational day 21, some offspring were euthanized to form the prenatal group. The remaining litters were born naturally, and dams received treatments via drinking water during gestation and lactation (6 weeks). After the lactation period, the pups were weaned and directly treated for an additional 9 weeks, resulting in an overall treatment duration of 15 weeks. Brain tissues were analyzed for MDA, GSH, TOS, TAS, OSI, BDNF, Caspase-3 activity, and histopathological changes. RESULTS: The nicotine-exposed pups exhibited significantly reduced crown-rump length, body mass, and brain mass compared to controls. Nicotine exposure decreased BDNF, GSH, and TAS levels and increased MDA, TOS, and OSI levels. Histopathologically, the nicotine prenatal group showed a significantly higher number of heterochromatic nuclei in brain tissue. Caspase-3 activity did not show a significant increase in nicotine groups compared to the control. Vitamin E supplementation mitigated nicotine-induced brain damage in some measured parameters. CONCLUSION: Perinatal nicotine exposure induces oxidative damage in the brain tissue of rat offspring, while vitamin E exerts a protective antioxidant effect, preventing nicotine-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, the significant reduction in BDNF levels and the increase in heterochromatic nuclei in the nicotine-exposed groups highlight the detrimental impact of nicotine on neurodevelopment, which can be effectively mitigated by vitamin E supplementation."

Alongside, we investigated feed consumption, carcass traits, arsenic levels in blood and organs, mineral distribution in different tissues, and potential human health risks from consuming meat from arsenic-exposed goats. Thirty healthy male Black Bengal goat weaned kids, averaging 6.15 ± 0.32 kg and 142.87 ± 9.28 days old, were involved in the trial. They were divided into five equal treatment groups. The diet consisted of chopped sorghum sudan grass as roughage and a concentrate mixture for growth and maintenance of young goats. Arsenic was administered through the concentrate as sodium arsenite, with T0 as the control (no arsenic). To prevent stress-related issues, kids under T1-T4 groups received gradually increasing arsenic doses over a three-week adaptation period, followed by a consistent 50 ppm dose for 17 weeks. Vitamin E and yeast culture were introduced concurrently with arsenic exposure, with DL-α-Tocopherol added to the concentrate at 250 IU/kg of feed dry matter for T2 and T4, and T3 and T4 received 4 × 109 colony forming units of yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) daily. High arsenic levels led to reduced feed dry matter intake (g/kg body weight) (p = 0.01) and crude protein consumption (g/kg body weight) (p < 0.001) in arsenic-challenged goats. However, supplementation with vitamin E, yeast culture, or both mitigated these effects and decreased blood arsenic levels (p < 0.001). Interestingly, neither arsenic exposure nor the mitigation strategies significantly impacted the levels of Ca, P, Mg, Cu, Mn, Zn and Fe in various organs and carcass components except for liver copper levels, which showed a negative correlation (p < 0.008) with arsenic concentration. Organs such as the liver, kidneys and testes accumulated higher (p < 0.001) arsenic levels compared to other body parts. Vitamin E, alone or with yeast culture, significantly reduced (p < 0.001) arsenic deposition in carcass components, while yeast culture alone showed no additional benefit. Despite supplementation, arsenic levels in meat and carcass parts from exposed goats (T1, T2, T3 and T4) remained higher (p < 0.001) than in the control group, posing a cancer risk exceeding acceptable thresholds value (1 × 10-6). Vitamin E supplementation, alone or combined with S. cerevisiae, partially mitigated arsenic deposition in various organs and body parts, offering a promising solution to the issue.",

METHOD: In the present study, experimental chemical burns were induced in the right eyes of 22 New Zealand rabbits. The eyes were then divided into four groups for subsequent analysis: Trehalose + HA (Group T, n = 6); dexpanthenol + HA (Group P, n = 6); coenzyme Q10+vitamin E + HA (Group V, n = 6); and one control group (CG, n = 4). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the size of the epithelial defect area between the groups on days 1, 3, and 5. However, a marked difference in the healing of epithelial defects was observed. Histologic analysis revealed optimal healing in terms of stromal edema, epithelial disruption, and lymphatic infiltration in group P. Alpha SMA (alpha smooth actin)-positive areas was higher in groups P and V. Electron microscopic examination revealed enhanced anterior surface epithelial formation and collagen arrangement in the treatment groups compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study are consistent with those of other studies in the literature, which have shown the superiority of trehalose, dexpanthenol, and coenzyme Q10 to the control group. Furthermore, histologic and immunohistochemical evaluations revealed that the P and V groups exhibited superior healing signs in comparison to the T group. Notably, our study is the first to comparatively analyze artificial tears with trehalose, dexpanthenol, and coenzyme Q10 in terms of epithelial defect healing, incorporating electron microscopic examination."

      "abstract": "The increase in tocopherol (vitamin E) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis during drought and osmotic stress, but not during high light or nitrogen deprivation, is mediated by abscisic acid. Plants increase the production of antioxidants including tocochromanols (vitamin E) during stress. To study the regulation of tocochromanol synthesis, Arabidopsis plants were exposed to drought, osmotic stress stimulated by polyethylene glycol, abscisic acid (ABA), nitrogen deprivation, and high light. ABA treatment resulted in increased contents of tocochromanols, and expression of the key tocopherol biosynthesis genes VTE2 and HPPD was upregulated, indicating that tocochromanol accumulation was regulated by ABA. Under drought and osmotic stress, the ABA and tocochromanol contents as well as VTE2 and HPPD expression were also increased. ABA levels did not change during nitrogen deprivation or high light treatment, indicating that tocochromanol accumulation under these conditions was ABA-independent. Tocochromanol accumulation during drought or osmotic stress was not compromised in the ABA-deficient aba1-6, aba2-1 and aba3-2 mutants, suggesting that tocochromanol synthesis under these conditions was mostly regulated in an ABA-independent way. Therefore, the accumulation of tocochromanols in Arabidopsis can be regulated by ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signaling pathways, based on the specific conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Antioxidants, including vitamin E (VE) and grape seed extract (GSE), as anti-aging supplementation have been widely used to improve human health. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in health and affects the treatment effect of various interventions. However, the role of gut microbiota in VE remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the longitudinal impact of VE treatment on body health and the gut microbiota. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 90 healthy individuals. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: a treatment group receiving VE, another antioxidant treatment group receiving GSE, and a control group receiving a placebo. We found that VE ameliorated blood cholesterol levels by reducing the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in healthy volunteers. After the intervention, there was an increase in the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and bile acid metabolizers. Specifically, the abundances of Lachnospira sp. and Faecalibacterium spp. increased in the VE. Interestingly, the gut microbiota of poor responders harbored a greater proportion of disease-associated bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: VE could promote health by lowering LDL-C, partly and indirectly by affecting gut bacteria with the ability to produce SCFAs or metabolize bile acids. REGISTRATION NUMBER FOR CLINICAL TRIALS: The clinical trial was registered on August 28, 2021. Registration number was ChiCTR2100050567 (https://www.chictr.org.cn)."

      "abstract": "There is growing interest among consumers in the nutritional value of the food they consume. The objectives of this study were (1) to document the nutritional value, with a focus on the fatty acid profile, of beef from cattle from one commercial production system that only ever received grass-based feed ingredients compared with similar animals finished in more conventional, i.e., with high-concentrate or concentrate-supplemented grass silage, production systems; (2) to determine the effect of the dietary treatments on muscles representing a range in intramuscular fat concentrations and commercial value, viz supraspinatus, semitendinosus, longissimus lumborum and psoas major; and (3) to determine if the fatty acid profile can be used to distinguish between different beef muscles. Dietary treatment and muscle type influenced the concentration of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid, with the highest concentrations observed in psoas major from cattle fed grass only. These data should be of use to the meat industry and to those updating nutritional databases. The possibility of discriminating beef according to its dietary background based on the fatty acid profile was confirmed. While this approach was moderately successful with respect to the separation of supraspinatus, longissimus lumborum and psoas major, discrimination between the more valuable longissimus lumborum and the lower-value semitendinosus is more challenging."

Vitamin E is a powerful fat-soluble antioxidant; some studies have shown its beneficial effects in reducing oxidized LDL levels. Due to the inconsistent reports, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of vitamin E supplementation on oxidation of LDL levels. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to find clinical trials published in English. A total of 21 records with 29 intervention arms were included in this review. In the meta-analysis of 6 studies that reported changes in oxidized LDL levels, a significant decrease in LDL oxidation was observed (95% CI: -1.44 [-2.5, -0.38]; I2 = 95.8%, P < 0.001; Tau-squared: 1.6171). Moreover, a meta-analysis of 7 studies that reported lag time as a measure of LDL oxidation showed that vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the lag time of LDL oxidation (95% CI: 20.45 [12.46, 28.43]; I2 = 95.9%, P < 0.001; Tau-squared: 103.3545). Two studies used the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay to evaluate the susceptibility to LDL oxidation. One of them showed a significant decrease in LDL susceptibility to oxidation after supplementation with tocopherol, while the other one did not show a significant effect. Vitamin E significantly reduced the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and increased the lag time of LDL oxidation.",

We hypothesize that different dietary tocopherol isoforms have different health effects in people with CKD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between dietary vitamin E and tocopherol isoforms and risks of CKD progression and all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 3 791 participants with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) were included. The main exposures included dietary vitamin E and tocopherol isoforms, which were estimated by the validated Diet History Questionnaire at baseline, year 2, and year 4 before the study outcome was diagnosed. The primary outcome was CKD progression, defined as a 50% decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline or initiation of kidney replacement therapy. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 5.5 years, 1 188 (31.3%) CKD progression events occurred. There was an L-shaped relationship between total vitamin E intake and risks of CKD progression and all-cause mortality. Regarding dietary tocopherol isoforms, there was an L-shaped relationship of dietary beta-tocopherol with risks of CKD progression and all-cause mortality, a reversed J-shaped relationship between dietary gamma-tocopherol and the risk of CKD progression and a U-shaped association between dietary delta-tocopherol and the risk of CKD progression. There was no significant association between dietary alpha-tocopherol and risks of CKD progression and all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There was an L-shaped association between total vitamin E and CKD progression in patients with CKD. Different dietary tocopherol isoforms have different relationships with CKD progression in patients with CKD, which included an L-shaped association for beta-tocopherol, a reversed J-shaped association for gamma-tocopherol, a U-shaped association for delta-tocopherol and a non-significant association for alpha-tocopherol."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The research is based on the assessment of the beneficial role of vitamin E (vit-E) supplementation on the reproductive and renal functions in Cadmium (Cd)-exposed male mice. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Mice (n = 15 in each group) were kept untreated (Group A) or fed with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) (3.5 mg/kg, Group B) per day or both CdCl2 (3.5 mg/kg) with vit-E supplementation (200 mg/kg, Group C) daily for 60 days. Mice were euthanized, blood samples were collected, and serum was prepared for biochemical and hormonal analysis. Sperm motility, sperm concentration, testis weight, and diameter were taken. Tissues from the kidneys and testicles were collected in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histotexture study. RESULTS: Cd treatment reduced the serum thyroxine (T4) and testosterone levels, but vit-E supplementation increased both T4 and testosterone levels in the Cd-treated mice. Cd treatment decreased sperm motility and concentration, testicular weight, and diameter, and induced degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules, which significantly improved upon vit-E supplementation. Increased serum urea, uric acid, and creatinine concentrations, along with cellular infiltration in the renal tubular epithelium and glomerular hyperplasia, were found in the Cd-treated mice, which were not found in the vit-E-supplemented mice. CONCLUSION: The study points to the harmful consequences of Cd on reproductive performance and renal functions that could potentially be mitigated upon vit-E supplementation in the diet."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant effect of vitamin E on diabetic nephropathy. A control group and three groups of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (untreated diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with vitamin E 250 and 500 mg/kg) were studied. After 4 weeks of treatment, the kidneys were removed under anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital. The kidneys were weighed, the AT1 and AT2 receptor expression was measured by Western blot, and the activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase were determined in the renal cortex. Rats with diabetes mellitus had hyperglycemia, increased food and water consumption, and higher urinary volume than control rats. In diabetic rats (DM), kidney hypertrophy was observed and measured by kidney weight, protein/DNA ratio in the renal cortex, and proximal tubular cell area; proteinuria and reduced creatinine clearance were observed. AT1 and AT2 receptor expression in the kidney cortex of DM rats increased significantly compared to normoglycemic rats; antioxidant enzyme activities were decreased; treatment with vitamin E reversed kidney hypertrophy and reduced proteinuria; reduction in expression of AT1 and AT2 receptors was associated with increased antioxidant activity. Thus, treatment with vitamin E slows the progress of DN.",

      "abstract": "Excessive inflammation in cells are a common cause of inflammation-related diseases such as cardiometabolic diseases. The cellular multiprotein complex nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a cellular key modulator of inflammatory processes. In addition to classic medications, phytochemicals are known for their anti-inflammatory potential. In African folk medicine the seeds of Garcinia kola are used to support the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Of particular interest is the phytochemical garcinoic acid (GA, trans-13'-carboxy-δ-tocotrienol), which is isolated from the Garcinia kola seeds. This derivative and potential metabolite of the vitamin E congener δ-tocotrienol (T3) shows anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. To get better insights into the molecular mode of action, murine J774A.1 macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) only or in combination with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which led to canonical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent pyroptosis. A combined treatment with GA resulted in significantly reduced stimulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor 'ĸ-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NF-ĸB), decreased expression of inflammasome-related genes and marked downregulation of autoproteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 (Casp-1). Consequently, GA had an inhibitory effect on pyroptosis. The results have been validated using the well-known NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950. In conclusion, GA was shown to have relevant effects on the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis in vitro. Our study provides new mechanistic insights into the anti-inflammatory mode of action of GA and highlights its relevance as a potential phytochemical drug for the treatment of inflammation."

We aimed to determine the risk of developing iron deficiency during treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) with vitamin E. Iron status was monitored prospectively in 20 people with MASLD treated with 200 - 800 IU/d vitamin E (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01792115). To gain mechanistic insights liver histology, hepatic gene expression, hepatic 4-hydroxynonenal, haptoglobin genotype and plasma vitamin E levels were assessed. We found iron deficiency to occur in 11/20 subjects (55%) after a median 11 weeks (range 4-13) of vitamin E treatment, and anemia to occur in 6 of the 11 (30% of study population) after 23 weeks (16-36). Ferritin (84.5 ± 85.2 to 47.8 ± 54.9μg/L, p < 0.001) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV, 86.2 ± 4.9 to 84.3±4.3fL, p = 0.003) significantly decreased, with a concomitant rise in red-cell distribution width (RDW, 13.4 ± 1.3 to 14.4 ± 1.9%, p = 0.003). A gastrointestinal bleeding source was found in 75% of subjects with complete work-up. Iron deficiency occurred in all diabetics vs. 47% of non-diabetics (p 0.007). Iron deficiency risk was not associated with cirrhosis, platelet count, prothrombin time, haptoglobin genotype, or plasma vitamin E level. Changes in hepatic gene expression and oxidative stress were suggestive of an extrahepatic effect. Iron deficiency resolved with appropriate care even with continued vitamin E treatment. We conclude that occult gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency were frequently observed during vitamin E treatment, possibly reflecting an effect on platelet function. Close monitoring is warranted during the first months of treatment, especially in diabetics and subjects with risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin E (VitE), a potent antioxidant, has demonstrated significant potential in mitigating oxidative stress and cellular damage, making it a valuable agent for countering environmental toxicities, including those caused by polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs). This study examined the effects of PSNPs on the zebrafish visual system and evaluated the protective role of VitE. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to PSNPs (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/mL) with or without 20 μM VitE co-treatment from fertilization to 6 days post-fertilization (dpf). Visual function, morphology, and molecular responses were assessed at 4 or 6 dpf. Exposure to PSNPs at concentrations of 0.1 to 10 μg/mL significantly increased bioaccumulation in the zebrafish eye in a concentration-dependent manner and disrupted the visual system. These disruptions caused a reduction in the eye-to-body length ratio and decreased optomotor response positivity and swimming distance, indicating impaired visual function and behavior. Furthermore, PSNPs elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, induced retinal apoptosis, and disrupted gene expression related to visual development (six6, pax2, pax6a, and pax6b), apoptosis (tp53, casp3, bax, and bcl2a), and antioxidant defense (sod1, cat, and gpx1a). VitE co-treatment significantly mitigated these adverse effects, reducing oxidative damage, restoring antioxidant defenses, and preserving retinal function. This study highlights the potential of VitE as a protective agent against PSNP-induced visual dysfunction and underlines the urgent need to address nanoplastic pollution to protect aquatic ecosystems.",

One hundred and five 10-week-old quail cocks were acclimated and divided into five treatment groups: negative control - G1, DEX-treated (20 mgL-1 of drinking water) - G2, DEX + VE (180 mg kg diet-1) - G3; DEX + Se (0.3 mg kg diet-1) - G4; and DEX + VE (180 mg kg diet-1) + Se (0.3 mg kg diet-1) - G5. The birds received their respective treatments over 21 days, and various performance, hematological, and semen quality parameters were measured. Results indicated that DEX treatment significantly reduced weight gain (WG) and feed intake (P < 0.05). Supplementation with VE and Se, individually and combined, ameliorated these effects, with groups G3, G4, and G5 showing similar WG to the control. Hematological analysis revealed significant increases (P < 0.05) in packed cell volume, hemoglobin, and white blood cell count in DEX-treated groups compared to G1. Treatment did not affect blood glucose and cholesterol levels (P ≥ 0.05). Plasma antioxidant assays showed elevated superoxide dismutase and catalase functions and reduced malondialdehyde levels in G3, G4, and G5 compared to G2, indicating reduced oxidative stress. No marked differences were seen in the plasma glutathione peroxidase activities across groups. Sperm motility was impaired in the DEX-only group but improved (P < 0.05) with antioxidant supplementation. In conclusion, dietary VE and Se effectively mitigated the negative impacts of DEX-induced stress on growth, antioxidant status, and spermatozoa motility in Japanese quail cocks. VE and Se supplementation could be beneficial in enhancing the welfare and productivity of poultry under stress.",

RESULTS: Monosex Nile tilapia fingerlings were sourced from the Bazina farm and hatchery in Ismailia Governorate, Egypt, where the experiment was also conducted. The fish were acclimatized for 15 days before the trial. A total of 240 fingerlings (average weight 46 ± 3.0 g/fish) were divided equally across 12 concrete tanks (1 × 1 × 1.2 m, 1 m³ capacity), with 20 fish per tank. The fish were fed a control diet (T0), which was a basal diet with no supplementation, or one of three experimental diets for 60 days: T1 (1 mg SeNPs/kg), T2 (100 mg VE/kg), and T3 (1 mg SeNPs + 100 mg VE/kg). The experiment followed a completely randomized design (CRD) with three replicates per treatment. The combination of SeNPs and VE (T3) resulted in the best feed conversion ratio. A slight but significant increase (P < 0.05) in whole-body composition was observed in all treatment groups compared to the control. Biochemical parameters, serum digestive enzyme activity, and antioxidant levels improved significantly with dietary supplementation. Histopathological analysis revealed somewhat lacerated gill arches in fish fed SeNPs, VE, or their combination, but the overall gill structure remained normal. The SeNPs + VE group exhibited improved villi length and normal morphology of portal veins and hepatic sinusoids, though some vacuolated hepatocytes were noted. Fish in the SeNPs + VE group had the lowest mortality rates and the highest resistance to A. flavus. CONCLUSION: Supplementing diets with SeNPs and/or VE enhances growth, body composition, biochemical parameters, and histopathology in Nile tilapia. The combination of 1 mg SeNPs + 100 mg VE/kg improves immune response and growth, offering a promising strategy to enhance Tilapia health and productivity.",

Selenium deficiency can also result in signs of cardiac disease, upper gastrointestinal dysfunction, and abortion or the birth of weak foals. Deficiencies can usually be readily established by evaluating the dietary intake of individuals and by measurement of blood concentrations of these nutrients.

MARTIALS AND METHOD: This single-center, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted at Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. Ninety male patients, aged 15-25 years, with infertility and varicocele grade 2 or 3, were randomized into two groups. The intervention group received 400 units of vitamin E daily for 3 months, while the control group received a placebo. Sperm analysis was conducted before and 3 months after the intervention. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23, with significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were enrolled and equally randomized into two groups (n = 45 per group). The mean age was 30.68 ± 6.31 years. Post-intervention, the improvement in sperm motility was significantly higher in the vitamin E group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.03). Both groups showed significant improvements in sperm motility, count, and morphology from pre- to post-intervention (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Vitamin E supplementation post-varicocelectomy is associated with improved sperm parameters, suggesting potential benefits in the management of male infertility related to varicocele. However, varicocelectomy alone also results in significant improvements. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20200911048689N1). Registered on October 10, 2020.",

      "abstract": "Retinopathy with vitamin E deficiency is a familial disease in the English Cocker Spaniel dog breed. Ophthalmic abnormalities observed in retinopathy with vitamin E deficiency-affected English Cocker Spaniel include lipofuscin granule deposition within the tapetal fundus and subsequent retinal degeneration resulting in visual deficits. Affected dogs may also exhibit neurological signs that include ataxia and hindlimb proprioceptive deficits. In all cases, circulating plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol are low. This study sought to investigate the genetic basis of retinopathy with vitamin E deficiency in the English Cocker Spaniel breed. We undertook a genome-wide association study comprising 30 English Cocker Spaniels with normal fundic examinations aged 6 years or older (controls) and 20 diagnosed with retinopathy with vitamin E deficiency (cases) and identified a statistically associated signal on chromosome 29 (Praw = 1.909 × 10-17). Whole genome sequencing of 2 cases identified a 102 bp deletion in exon 1 of the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein gene (TTPA), truncating the protein by 34 amino acids. The c.23_124del variant segregated with retinopathy with vitamin E deficiency in a total of 30 cases and 43 controls. Variants in TTPA are causal for ataxia with vitamin E deficiency in humans which is a phenotypically similar disease to retinopathy with vitamin E deficiency. The identification of the canine variant is extremely significant as the availability of a DNA test will allow for identification of presymptomatic dogs and early therapeutic intervention which may prevent development of retinopathy and improve neurological signs. Breeders can also use the DNA test to efficiently eradicate the disease from this breed.",

Pigs were fed diets containing SO that was either unprocessed (23 °C; peroxide value (PV) of 3 meq/kg and an anisidine value of 4) or thermally processed at 135 °C for 42 h (PV of 30 meq/kg and an anisidine value of 501). The corn-soybean meal-based diets contained either 10% SO (EXP 1) or 8% SO (EXP 2). Pigs were fed the experimental diets for 22 d (EXP 1, 13.5 to 24.0 kg, 2 pigs/pen) or 27 d (EXP 2, 21.3 to 37.5 kg, 1 pig/pen), each with 10 replications per dietary treatment. Pigs fed diets containing the peroxidized SO had reduced ADG, ADFI, and GF compared to pigs fed diets containing the unheated SO (P ≤ 0.01). Pigs fed diets containing peroxidized SO had increased plasma concentrations of F2-isoprostanes and reactive oxygen metabolites compared to pigs fed diets containing unheated SO (P ≤ 0.01). In contrast, plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentrations tended to decrease in pigs fed diets containing peroxidized SO compared to pigs fed diets containing unheated SO (P = 0.10). There was no apparent effect of pigs consuming diets containing peroxidized SO on plasma antioxidant adsorbent capacity or an oxidative stress index (P ≥ 0.19). Pigs fed diets containing peroxidized SO resulted in a reduction in plasma vitamin E compared to pigs fed diets containing unheated SO (P ≤ 0.01). Results indicate that adding SO that has been thermally processed thereby containing high concentrations of aldehydes resulted in inconsistent changes of markers of oxidative stress, but dramatically reduced plasma vitamin E concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a global epidemic associated with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic disorders. Bariatric surgery is a highly effective intervention for sustained weight loss and the improvement of obesity-related comorbidities. However, post-surgery nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin E, remain a concern. This study investigates the role of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to vitamin E transport and bioavailability in determining vitamin E levels post bariatric surgery. A cohort of 140 patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery was analyzed. Serum vitamin E levels were measured before and one year after surgery, and SNPs in genes associated with vitamin E transport and metabolism were genotyped using PCR, DHPLC, and sequencing methods. Associations between SNPs, haplotypes, and vitamin E levels were statistically evaluated. Significant associations were observed between the APOE rs7412 SNP and serum vitamin E levels. The rare T allele was linked to lower vitamin E levels post surgery, with an increased frequency in patients with severe deficiency (<11.6 μmol/L). Haplotype analysis of APOE revealed that the ε2 haplotype (T-T) was strongly associated with vitamin E deficiency. Other SNPs, including CD36 rs1761667, SCARB1 rs4238001, and ABCA1 rs4149314, were also linked to changes in vitamin E levels, suggesting that an impaired bioavailability and transport can be the reason for low vitamin E levels post surgery. Genetic polymorphisms in APOE, CD36, SCARB1, and ABCA1 significantly influence vitamin E status after bariatric surgery. These findings highlight the importance of personalized supplementation strategies considering patients' genetic profiles to mitigate the risk of vitamin E deficiency and related complications.",

In this study, twenty-eight male rats, ten weeks old and weighing between 250 and 300 grams, were divided into four groups. The first group served as the control and received daily intraperitoneal injections of Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for four weeks. The second group received a single dose of Busulfan at 40 mg/kg body weight via intraperitoneal injection. The third group received the same single dose of Busulfan along with daily intraperitoneal injections of Vitamin E at 100 mg/kg body weight for four weeks. The fourth group was given only Vitamin E at the same dosage for four weeks. At the end of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed, and blood samples were collected to test antioxidant enzyme levels (GSH, SOD, CAT) and analyze serum concentrations of reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, and testosterone). Additionally, sperm motility and viability were assessed after collecting epididymal spermatozoa. The findings revealed that Busulfan significantly increased serum levels of both FSH and LH while causing a notable decrease in testosterone levels. Furthermore, Busulfan treatment resulted in a significant reduction in sperm count, motility, and viability, along with a marked increase in sperm morphological abnormalities. In contrast, supplementation with Vitamin E alongside Busulfan improved hormone levels and enhanced sperm function. In conclusion, Busulfan has a toxic effect on sperm and directly impacts body weight and testicular weight. However, Vitamin E demonstrates beneficial therapeutic effects on testicular tissue and enhances sperm production in rats treated with Busulfan.",

This study examines the effects of palm vitamin E on bone histomorphometry in a male rat model of alcohol-induced osteoporosis. Methods: Three-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into seven groups, with one baseline control group (BC) and six experimental groups undergoing a two-phase treatment. In the first month, the control group received normal saline, while experimental groups received intraperitoneal alcohol (3 g/kg) three times weekly. For the subsequent two months, alcohol treatment continued in one group (A), while others received olive oil (C), saline (AN), alpha-tocopherol (AA), or palm vitamin E (AE) orally. Results: Femur histomorphometric analysis post-sacrifice showed that alcohol exposure significantly decreased osteoblastic activity and impaired bone microarchitecture, evidenced by reduced Ob.S/BS, OS/BS, OV/BV, Tb.Th, BV/TV, and Tb.N, alongside increased Oc.S/BS, ES/BS, and Tb.Sp. Both alpha-tocopherol and palm vitamin E improved bone parameters, with palm vitamin E showing superior efficacy except in OV/BV. Conclusions: These findings suggest that palm vitamin E may offer a therapeutic benefit for mitigating alcohol-induced bone damage."

Forty rats were divided into four groups: a control group, an azithromycin treatment group, selenium and vitamin E treatment group, and a combined treatment group receiving both azithromycin, selenium, and vitamin E. Results showed that the azithromycin-treated group exhibited significant increases in interleukin-10 levels, myocardial fibrosis, and cell structure degeneration, while combined selenium and vitamin E treatment markedly reduced these adverse effects, indicating a protective effect.

This study investigated the potential effects of zinc and vitamin E on neurobehavioural alterations in male Wistar rats fed with Bonny light crude oil (BLCO)-contaminated diet. Methods: Thirty (30) male Wistar rats (160 ± 10 g) were assigned into five groups (n = 6). Group 1 received standard rat feed, Group 2 was exposed to BLCO (0.1 mL/g of rat feed) for 3 weeks, and groups 3-5 were treated with zinc (50 mg/kg/day), vitamin E (400 IU/kg), or both [vitamin E (400 IU/kg) + zinc (50 mg/kg/day)], respectively for 1 week after BLCO exposure for 3 weeks. Locomotive, anxiolytic, depressive-like behaviours and spatial memory were assessed using the open-field test, elevated plus maze, forced swim test and Y-maze. Rats were sacrificed and the brain samples were collected for biochemical assays at the end of the behavioural tests. Results: Zinc and vitamin E supplementation (individually or combined) significantly increased brain total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha) and lipid peroxidation, normalized neurotransmitter levels in the brain and improved behavioural performance. Conclusion: Treatment with Zn and/or vitamin E reverses BLCO-induced neurobehavioural alterations via modulation of oxidative stress, inflammation and neurotransmitters."

      "abstract": "Natural forms of vitamin E include four tocopherols and four tocotrienols (α, β, γ, and δ), which are essential as lipophilic antioxidants. Among these eight isoforms, α-tocopherol (αT), the predominant form of vitamin E found in tissues, has traditionally received the most attention in disease prevention research due to its robust antioxidant activity. However, recent studies suggest that other forms of vitamin E exhibit distinct and potentially more potent beneficial activities in disease prevention and treatment. These non-αT forms of vitamin E are metabolized in vivo, producing various metabolites, including 13'-carboxychromanol, though their biological roles remain largely unknown. Notably, sphingolipids, known for their significant roles in cancer biology, may be involved in the anticancer effects of vitamin E through the modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. This review focuses on the diverse biological activities of different vitamin E forms and their metabolites, particularly their anticancer effects, while highlighting the underlying mechanisms, including their novel impact on regulating sphingolipid pathways. By elucidating these interactions, we aim to provide a deeper understanding on the multifaceted roles of vitamin E in cancer prevention and therapy.",

A total of 32 male mice, aged 12 months, were divided into a control group and three treatment groups. These groups received varying daily doses of vitamin E for a period of 28 days. The results showed significant improvements in cognitive function, specifically in working memory and spatial learning, in the groups that received vitamin E (100, 200, or 400 mg/kg) compared to the control group. The markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities also demonstrated improvements, with higher doses of vitamin E showing greater effects. The analysis of gene expression revealed increased expression of SIRT1, Nrf2, and Calstabin2, particularly at higher doses of vitamin E. These findings suggest that vitamin E supplementation may help counteract age-related cellular changes. The study concludes that vitamin E supplementation can reduce oxidative stress, enhance cognitive function, and affect genetic markers of aging in mice, which may have therapeutic benefits in addressing age-related cognitive decline and oxidative damage. Further research is necessary to investigate the clinical implications of these findings in humans."

Alcohol has the potential to hinder the liver's capacity, which results in a variety of metabolic imbalances and deficiencies. This research aimed to investigate alterations in the liver tissue due to alcohol administered orally, along with exploring the potential protective effects of vitamin E against these alterations. METHODS: An assortment of male pet rabbits (totaling 18) was part of the study. The categorized groups included: Control group A, which received normal saline as a placebo treatment. Experimental group B, administered with an oral dose of a 30% ethanol solution mixed with normal saline. Experimental group C, given an oral dose of a combination containing a 30% ethanol solution, vitamin E, and normal saline. At the end of experiment, blood samples were obtained to assess ALT levels, and liver tissue sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for microscopic analysis of hepatocyte structure. RESULTS: Highly significant differences between the blood ALT levels, hepatocyte count/size/nuclear count/size, sinusoids size in control and experimental groups were observed. Vitamin treated rabbits showed preserved morphology of hepatocytes as compared to non-vitamin treated rabbits during alcohol consumption by showing less ballooning of hepatocytes and shrinkage of nuclei which are the main initial signs of hepatocytes damage. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent alcohol intake leads to swift alterations in liver tissue and blood ALT levels over brief spans, yet these effects may be reduced through the antioxidative properties of vitamin E.",

Oxidative stress associated with renal and metabolic dysfunctions is one of the cardiovascular complications (CVC) in haemodialysis patients. The aim of the present study is to analyse the oxidative stress markers in CDK patients supplemented with antioxidants and vitamin E, with monitoring of CVC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on 99 subjects. CKD patients received oral supplementation of vitamin E (300 mg/day) for 2 years. Oxidative stress markers, nitric oxide (NO); myeloperoxidase (MPO); oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDLox); malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione were measured before and after the vitamin treatment. RESULTS: NO (62.62 ±2.80 μmol/l), LDLox (10.55 ±4.62 μmol/l), MDA (6.11 ±2.83 μmol/l) and MPO (53.35 ±3.82 UI/ml) were overconcentrated, while glutathione (62.09 ±4.15 UI/ml) was less concentrated in CKD patients with cardiovascular complications, compared to those without cardiovascular complications (67.08 ±1.90 μmol/l, 31.18 ±5.25 μmol/l, 16 ±6.47 μmol/l, 57.00 ±7.24 UI/ml, 43.09 ±3.33 UI/ml, respectively). After 2 years of vitamin E treatment, the overall cardiovascular complications were not significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that oral complementation with vitamin E did not affect the occurrence of cardiovascular complications associated with CKD. These findings may pave the way for future innovative strategies for antioxidant supplementation in CKD patients."

This study aims to evaluate the potential of vitamin E supplements as a protective agent against spleen injury by examining physiological, hematological, biochemical, and histological changes in diabetic rat model. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male wistar albino rats through an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg Streptozotocin, and the rats were randomly divided into five groups. The rats were then administered varying doses of vitamin E for 14 consecutive days. Assessments included renal function tests, blood glucose levels, complete blood counts, lipid profiles, tissue oxidative stress and spleen histology. An acute toxicity study was also conducted on normal rats. RESULTS: Vitamin E supplementation did not result in any mortality up to 5000 mg/kg body weight. The treated diabetic group showed improved metabolic characteristics, such as normal body weight, food and water intake and a reduced spleen index compared to the untreated diabetic group. Significant improvements were observed in hematological parameters like packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration, RBC (red blood cells) and WBC (white blood cells) counts. HCA (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis) of these parameters indicated that doses of 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg were most similar to normal condition. Catalase and MDA (Malondialdehyde) assays showed a substantial reduction in oxidative stress in spleen tissue and histopathological examination revealed significant regenerative effects. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that vitamin E supplementation significantly enhanced various metabolic, hematological, biochemical, and histological parameters in the diabetic group compared to those who did not receive the treatment. Among the doses tested, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg body weight were found to yield the most favorable outcomes.",

They significantly contribute to preserving skin health, particularly by regulating the epidermal barrier and moisture levels within the skin. This study aims to explore the moisturizing and antioxidant effect of skin barrier restoring cream Moiz MM (MZ) with shea butter, silkflo and vitamin E by investigating its protective effect against oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and therapeutic mechanisms in human keratinocytes cells (HaCaT). METHODS: The in vitro antioxidant activity of MZ was evaluated by DPPH, ABTS and NO assays. For the cell culture study, HaCaT cells were cultured and stimulated using H2O2 and then treated with different concentrations of MZ. Then, it was subjected to DCFH-DA staining, reverse transcriptase PCR and western blot analysis for the evaluation of various skin-moisture-related components in human keratinocyte cells. Type I procollagen was examined using ELISA technique. RESULTS: The results highlighted that oxidative stress in HaCaT cells decreased type I procollagen synthesis, while MZ treatment significantly increased the synthesis. Moreover, the viability of HaCaT cells was not affected in the presence of MZ, which demonstrates its non-toxic effect. Furthermore, MZ can counteract H2O2-mediated oxidative stress by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activity such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, and decrease reactive oxygen species generation in skin cells. Additionally, MZ greatly promotes hyaluronic acid production by enhancing the expression of the hyaluronic acid synthase-1 gene and Aquaporin 3 protein. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MZ has the potential to serve as a moisturizing and antioxidant skincare formula.",

Triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in serum and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities (CAT) in the liver significantly reduced at 0.95 TSAA: Lys ratio (P < 0.05). Fatty acid synthase (FAS), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 alpha (CPT-1α) also upregulated at this TSAA: Lys ratio (P < 0.05). Compared with the DL-Met group, the OH-Met group had lower Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher TC, LDL, and VLDL concentrations (P < 0.05).The expression of FAS,CPT-1α), glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), glutathione synthetase (GSS), and Nrf2 were significantly higher in OH-Met compared with the DL-Met group (P < 0.05). OH-Met at 0.95 and DL-Met at 0.90 TSAA: Lys ratio showed higher CAT and lower aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Moreover, OH-Met at 0.90 and DL-Met at 0.95 of the TSAA: Lys ratio had a significant reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) (P < 0.05). Overall, these results suggest that OH-Met source with a lower level of VE positively influenced production performance and improved liver health in aged laying hens through improved lipid metabolism and hepatic antioxidant function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glyphosate (Gly) is a nonselective pesticide with high potential to toxic effects on the reproductive system. Recent studies suggest that Vitamin E can indeed have a positive impact on the reproductive system, while Gly, a nonselective pesticide, has been linked to significant risks of toxicity on reproductive health. It's crucial to be mindful of the potential impacts of such substances on the reproductive system. METHODS: Seventy female mice were categorized into seven groups.: (1) control, (2) olive oil (as Vit E solvent), (3) Vit E, (4) L-Gly, (5) H-Gly, (6) L-Gly + Vit E, and (7) H-Gly + Vit E. Various factors related to oxidative stress, antioxidant activity, steroid hormones, and mRNA expression levels of genes involved in apoptosis and steroidogenesis were assessed. RESULTS: After treatment with both doses of Gly, the malondialdehyde level significantly increased in comparison to the control group. Conversely, the activity of catalase and the levels of glutathione, estrogen, and progesterone decreased. Treatment of mice with both doses of Gly resulted in increased mRNA levels of Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 genes, as well as a decreased mRNA level of the Bcl-2 gene and factors involved in steroidogenesis (StAR and 3-β-HSD) comparison to the control group. CONCLUSION: These results offer that vitamin E could help improve some of the adverse effects of Gly in the ovaries of female mice."

An alternative approach to cancer treatment, such as cancer immunotherapy, is needed as the existing chemotherapy and radiotherapy approaches target the cancer cells and healthy dividing cells. Vitamin E is a plant-derived lipid-soluble antioxidant with numerous health-promoting benefits, including anticancer and immunomodulatory properties. Vitamin E comprises eight natural isoforms: tocopherols (α, β, δ, and γ) and tocotrienols (α, β, δ, and γ). While initial research focused on the anticancer properties of α-tocopherol, there is growing interest in other natural forms and modified synthetic analogues of vitamin E due to their unique properties and enhanced anticancer effects. Hence, this review is aimed at outlining the effect of vitamin E and its analogues at various steps of the cancer-immunity cycle that can be used to stimulate anticancer immune responses.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin E, encompassing tocopherols and tocotrienols is celebrated for its powerful antioxidant properties, which help neutralize free radicals and protect cells from oxidative damage. Over the years, research has shown that both tocopherols and tocotrienols offer significant benefits, including protection against radiation damage, cholesterol regulation, cardiovascular health, and neurological disorders. This wide range of benefits highlights the need for further exploration of vitamin E's role in managing various diseases. One particularly promising area is its potential application in treating ocular diseases like glaucoma. Despite advances in treatment, current options have limitations, making the investigation of alternative approaches crucial. Omics technologies, which allow for a detailed examination of biological systems, could provide valuable insights into how tocopherols and tocotrienols work at a molecular level. Their neuroprotective and antioxidative properties make them promising candidates for glaucoma management. Additionally, the sustainability of vitamin E is noteworthy, as by-products from its production can be repurposed into valuable resources for nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. As research continues, integrating omics technologies with the study of vitamin E derivatives could unveil new therapeutic possibilities, further enhancing our understanding of its diverse health benefits and its potential role in preventing and managing diseases."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting an estimated 3 in 10 people. The available treatment is far from optimal. Diet and lifestyle changes to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance are the basic management of NAFLD, but these are difficult to achieve and maintain. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects on oxidative stress, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of vitamin E for people with NAFLD. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin E alone, or vitamin E in combination with other vitamins or minerals, versus placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD. SEARCH METHODS: We used recommended Cochrane search methods. The latest search was performed on 2 February 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, at any dose, duration, and route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention, in people with NAFLD of any age, sex, or ethnic origin. We included participants with imaging techniques or histology-proven NAFLD and minimal alcohol intake, and participants with steatohepatitis who had liver biopsies. OUTCOMES: Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, non-serious adverse events, biochemical response, and imaging assessment of the degree of fatty liver. RISK OF BIAS: We used Cochrane's RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias for each of the predefined outcomes. SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. INCLUDED STUDIES: We included 16 randomised clinical trials involving 1066 paediatric and adult participants with NAFLD. Experimental groups received vitamin E alone (14 trials) or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C (2 trials). Control groups received placebo in 13 trials and no intervention in three trials. Daily dosages of oral vitamin E ranged from 298 international units (IU) to 1000 IU. Co-interventions were lifestyle and low-calorie diet interventions in 13 trials, ursodeoxycholic acid in one trial, unchanged diet and physical activity in one trial, and baseline treatments for type 2 diabetes in one trial. Nine trials had more than two intervention groups, but we used only the groups in which vitamin E alone or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C were compared with placebo or no intervention. In total, 7.9% (84/1066) of participants dropped out. Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 24 months. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: Vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 20.86; 3 trials, 351 participants; very low certainty evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 12.01; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. There were no data on liver-related mortality or liver-related morbidity. The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on physical health-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.74, 95% CI -0.52 to 2.01; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); psychosocial health-related quality of life (MD -0.57, 95% CI -4.11 to 2.97; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); and non-serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are also very uncertain. There were no data on proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (MD -9.29, 95% CI -13.69 to -4.89; 11 trials, 708 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD -4.90, 95% CI -7.24 to -2.57; 11 trials, 695 participants; moderate certainty evidence) levels compared with placebo or no intervention. Vitamin E may slightly reduce serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (MD -5.21, 95% CI -9.88 to -0.54; 5 trials, 416 participants; very low certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Vitamin E plus vitamin C versus placebo There were no data on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on reducing serum ALT (MD -0.50, 95% CI -4.58 to 3.58; 2 trials, 133 participants; very low certainty evidence), AST (MD 0.09, 95% CI -3.39 to 3.57; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (MD 1.58, 95% CI -3.22 to 6.38; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. We identified three ongoing trials, and six trials are awaiting classification. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know if long-term treatment (18 months to 24 months) with vitamin E administered alone affects all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, quality of life, or non-serious adverse events in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo or no intervention. We found no data on liver-related mortality, liver-related morbidity, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely reduces ALT and AST slightly when compared with placebo, but whether this has any impact on the clinical course in people with NAFLD is unknown. The trials on vitamin E plus vitamin C did not report on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, or non-serious adverse events. Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know the effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on liver enzymes in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo. FUNDING: Three trials disclosed no external funding. Five trials were industry funded. Five trials were funded by organisations with no vested interests. Three trials did not provide any information on clinical trial support or sponsorship. REGISTRATION: Protocol: doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015033.",

      "abstract": "Our study aimed to evaluate the dualistic effect of heat stress on muscle differentiation at different temperatures, and whether vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant, could offset any negative effects, using bovine skeletal-muscle-derived cells (BSMCs) with myogenic properties. The BSMCs were extracted from the skeletal muscle of 30-mo-old Korean native cattle and subjected to myogenic differentiation under 3 heat exposure conditions: 37 °C (control; CON), 39 °C (mild heat stress; MHS), and 41 °C (severe heat stress; SHS) for 24 h with or without vitamin E treatment (NE or VE). After 24 h treatments, the cells were returned to 37 °C incubators and differentiated until day 6. On day 1, because of the heat exposure, the gene expression of MYOG was the highest in MHS (P = 0.047), suggesting a promotive effect of mild heat stress on myogenic differentiation, while on day 6, compared with CON and MHS, MYOD (P = 0.013) and MYOG (P = 0.029) were the lowest in SHS. Vitamin E treatment also lowered MYOG (P = 0.097), regardless of heat exposure. On day 1, HSPB1 (P = 0.001) and HSP70 (P < 0.001) were the highest in SHS, and an interaction between heat exposure and vitamin E treatment was found on day 6 (P < 0.027). BCL-2 was also the highest on day 1 in SHS (P = 0.05), and an interaction of heat exposure and vitamin E treatment was found on day 1 on BAX expression (P = 0.038). For antioxidant genes, SOD1 (P = 0.002) and GPX1 (P < 0.001) were affected by heat exposure, with the highest levels being observed in SHS, and on day 6, GPX1 was still the highest in SHS (P = 0.027). The fusion index was also affected by heat exposure, showing a decrease in SHS and an increase in MHS compared with CON (P < 0.001). Significant effects were noted from heat exposure (P < 0.001), vitamin E treatment (P < 0.001), and the interaction of heat exposure and vitamin E treatment (P = 0.002) on the protein content. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that vitamin E could ameliorate the harmful effects of heat exposure by modulating heat shock proteins and apoptosis regulators, improving the protein synthesis of BSMCs during myogenic differentiation. These results suggest that vitamin E supplementation could potentially protect muscle development in beef cattle under summer heat stress.",

      "abstract": "Antipsychotic medications, while crucial in managing severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are frequently associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia (TD). TD, characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, especially of the face and limbs, poses a substantial clinical challenge due to its often irreversible nature. Conventional management strategies, including dose reduction and switching to atypical antipsychotics, frequently offer limited success, prompting exploration of alternative therapies. This case report highlights the effectiveness of vitamin E, a potent antioxidant, in treating a 28-year-old male with severe antipsychotic-induced EPS and TD, unresponsive to traditional therapies. The patient, who had been receiving paliperidone injections as part of his psychotic disorder treatment regimen, developed marked EPS, including muscle rigidity, a parkinsonian gait, significant motor disturbances as well as tardive dyskinesia. Despite discontinuation of paliperidone and initiation of procyclidine, propranolol, clonazepam, and omega-3 supplements, his symptoms persisted. Introduction of oral vitamin E at 400 IU daily led to a dramatic improvement, with an 80% reduction in EPS and TD symptoms within weeks. The patient's Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score decreased from 24 to 4, and his overall quality of life improved significantly. Gradual increase of vitamin E dosage to 1200 IU daily, coupled with tapering of other medications, eventually led to complete resolution of symptoms, as evidenced by an AIMS score of 0. The patient maintained symptom-free status during follow-up, with no recurrence of psychotic symptoms. This case underscores the potential role of vitamin E as a viable adjunctive treatment for TD, particularly in patients who do not respond adequately to conventional therapies. While the literature presents mixed evidence regarding vitamin E's effectiveness, this case adds to the growing body of research suggesting its benefits, especially when introduced early in the disease course. Further large-scale studies are warranted to establish the most effective treatment protocols and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from vitamin E therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The combination of oral pentoxifylline (Ptx) and vitamin E (VitE) has been used to treat radiation-induced fibrosis and soft tissue injury. Here, we review outcomes and perform a radiomic analysis of treatment effects in patients prescribed Ptx + VitE at our institution for the treatment of radiation necrosis (RN). METHODS: A total of 48 patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) had evidence of RN and had MRI before and after starting Ptx + VitE. The radiation oncologist's impression of the imaging in the electronic medical record was used to score response to treatment. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to train a model of radiomics features derived from radiation necrosis on pre- and 1st post-treatment T1 post-contrast MRIs that can classify the ultimate response to treatment with Ptx + VitE. RESULTS: A total of 43.8% of patients showed evidence of improvement, 18.8% showed no change, and 25% showed worsening RN upon imaging after starting Ptx + VitE. The median time-to-response assessment was 3.17 months. Nine patients progressed significantly and required Bevacizumab, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or surgery. Patients who had multiple lesions treated with SRS were less likely to show improvement (p = 0.037). A total of 34 patients were also prescribed dexamethasone, either before (7), with (16), or after starting (11) treatment. The use of dexamethasone was not associated with an improved response to Ptx + VitE (p = 0.471). Three patients stopped treatment due to side effects. Finally, we were able to develop a machine learning (SVM) model of radiomic features derived from pre- and 1st post-treatment MRIs that was able to predict the ultimate treatment response to Ptx + VitE with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) of 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: Ptx + VitE appears safe for the treatment of RN, but randomized data are needed to assess efficacy and validate radiomic models, which may assist with prognostication.",

The current study aims to study it as a reproductive toxin on the caprine testicular cells at 4- and 6-hour exposure duration. Paraquat treatment decreased the cell viability percentage and induced histological architectural alterations such as disruption of germinal epithelium, vacuolization, and pyknotic nuclei in the testis. The differential EB/AO staining also revealed an increased incidence of apoptosis after paraquat treatment at both dosages, i.e. 10 mM and 100 mM. Paraquat also induces oxidative stress, as evident via increased Malondialdehyde levels (a byproduct of lipid peroxidation) and a decline in the antioxidant capacity (FRAP). However, co-administration of Vitamin E significantly reduced the paraquat-mediated decline in cell viability percentage, histological alterations, and apoptosis incidences and generated oxidative stress, indicating its antioxidative properties against paraquat exposure. This research concludes that Vitamin E co-administration considerably reduced the toxicity of paraquat elicited in testicles, suggesting that Vitamin E may have advantageous potential in preventing the male gonadotoxicity caused by paraquat use in agriculture."

Five groups were utilized in the study: control, heat stress (NS), Q10, Vit E, and the combination group (Q10+Vit E). The mice were subjected for 15 min/day to a temperature of 43°C for 14 consecutive days, followed by daily treatments for two weeks with either normal saline, Q10 (500 mg/kg), Vit E (250 mg/kg), or their combination. The forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were employed to evaluate despair behavior, whereas the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) were used to assess anxious behaviors. Subsequently, the animals were sacrificed, and serum corticosterone levels, protein expression of inflammasome-related proteins, and hsp70 gene expression were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The study revealed that treatment with Vit E and Q10, alone or together, provided anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in the heat-stress-subjected animals. Also, giving Vit E and Q10 alone or together greatly lowered serum corticosterone levels. In the PFC, they also lowered the levels of hsp70 mRNA and NF-κB, caspase 1, NLRP3, and IL-1β proteins. It is speculated that treatment with Q10 and Vit E can attenuate heat stress-associated anxious and depressive responses by inhibiting the inflammatory pathways and modulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a proven and effective treatment for end-stage osteoarthritis. The success of THA is due in part to highly crosslinked polyethylene (XL) implants. In 2007, a new generation of polyethylene liners entered clinical use. The new liners infused polyethylene with vitamin E and became vitamin E infused polyethylene (EP). The EP liner was hypothesized to prevent the loss of mechanical properties caused by oxidation, extending the lifetime of the implant. This international prospective study aimed to quantify the clinical outcomes of a 977 patient cohort receiving EP and XL liners 10 years after surgery. METHODS: The prospective cohort study began in 2007, including eight countries and 17 centers. The final cohort included 977 patients (EP liner: n = 520; XL liner: n = 457). Patients were followed preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. Each follow-up visit involved clinical evaluation, radiography, and survey collection. The demographics and revisions were also recorded. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to evaluate statistical differences. RESULTS: At 10 years following surgery, 534 patients were eligible for follow-up. Of those eligible, 352 patients returned for clinical evaluation (65.9% eligible; 36.0% overall). No statistical differences were found (P > 0.05) in the demographics of the followed-up cohort. The linear wear rates were 0.00338 mm/year for EP liners and 0.0236 mm/year for XL liners using individual regression (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was observed in wear rates using cohort regression. Similarly, surveys suggested no significant outcomes between the EP and XL liner cohorts. The overall incidence of revision was 2.3% for EP and 2.0% for XL liners. CONCLUSIONS: The EP liner demonstrated significantly lower wear than its XL counterparts at 10 years after implantation. Results are promising, as vitamin E polyethylene may improve the lifetime performance of THA implants and ensure that arthroplasty innovations reflect the changing patient population.",

This study investigates the short term effects, and the ameliorative consequence of vitamin E on retinal changes that were associated with administration of AMIO. This is accomplished by investigating both retinal structural and conformational characteristics using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Fundus examination. Three groups of healthy rabbits of both sexes were used; the first group served as control. The second group was orally treated with AMIO (160 mg /kg body weight) in a daily basis for two weeks. The last group orally received AMIO as the second group for two weeks then, oral administration of vitamin E (100 mg/kg body weight) for another two weeks as well. FTIR results revealed significant structural and conformational changes in retinal tissue constituents that include lipids and proteins due to AMIO administration. AMIO treatment was associated with fluctuated changes (increased/decreased) in the band position and bandwidth of NH, OH, and CH bonds. This was concomitant with changes in the percentage of retinal protein constituents in particularly α-helix and Turns. AMIO facilitates the formation of intra-molecular hydrogen bonding and turned retinal lipids to be more disordered structure. In conclusion, the obtained FTIR data together with principal component analysis provide evidence that administration of vitamin E following the treatment with AMIO can ameliorate these retinal changes and, these biophysical changes are too early to be detected by Fundus examination.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) involves excessive liver fat accumulation and is closely linked to oxidative stress, which contributes to liver inflammation and damage. This study aimed to evaluate how interventions such as resistance training (RT) and vitamin E supplementation (VES) can modulate markers of NAFLD and key proteins regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, such as C1Q/TNF-related proteins (CTRPs). METHODS: Forty participants with NAFLD (mean age: 32.4 ± 8.2 years) were randomly assigned to one of four groups for 12 weeks: placebo (PLB), VES, PLB + RT, and VES + RT. VES was administered at 800 IU/day in a double-blind manner. The RT regimen included eight exercises at 60-80% of one-repetition maximum (1RM), with three sets of 8-12 repetitions, performed three times per week. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included body composition, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lipid profile, glycemic control, CTRP-2, CTRP-9, and 1RM evaluations. RESULTS: Following the interventions, there was a significant improvement in body composition, lipid profile, glycemic control, and 1RM indices in the exercise groups compared to non-exercise groups (p < 0.05). AST and ALT levels decreased in all groups (p < 0.05) compared to the PLB group. There was also a significant difference between the VES + RT group and both the VES and PLB + RT groups (p < 0.05). CTRP-2 and CTRP-9 levels decreased in the exercise groups compared to non-exercise groups (p < 0.05), and their changes showed a marked correlation with body composition, lipid profile, and glycemic control indices (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the benefits of RT on various health parameters among NAFLD patients. While adding VES to RT resulted in greater decreases in aminotransferases, it did not provide further improvements in other variables. Additionally, enhancements in body composition, lipid profile, and glycemic control indices were possibly associated with decreased levels of CTRPs.

This prospective clinical trial assessed the oxidant-antioxidant status in Egyptian patients with GD and the efficacy and safety and of vitamin E as an adjuvant antioxidant therapy. Forty children and adolescents with GD on stable doses of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) were enrolled. Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography were performed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes (reduced glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], and peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2]) were assessed. Patients were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with GD were randomized either to receive oral vitamin E for 6 months or not. All patients with GD had significantly higher MDA levels with lower levels of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Vitamin E and PRDX2 were negatively correlated to severity score index (SSI), lyso GL1, and MDA. After 6 months of vitamin E supplementation, SSI and liver and spleen volumes and liver stiffness were significantly lower. Lyso GL1 and MDA were significantly decreased post-vitamin E therapy while antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher compared with baseline levels and with patients without vitamin E therapy. Oxidative stress is related to disease severity in pediatric patients with GD. A 6-month vitamin E supplementation for those patients represents a safe therapeutic adjuvant agent increasing the efficacy of ERT, reducing oxidative stress, and improving outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this work is to examine the effects of vitamin E addition to water on the structure of the gill tissue and energy metabolism of crucian carp (Carassius auratus) under cooling stress. The crucian carp were chilled using a cold acclimation intelligent chilling equipment from 20 °C to 5 °C. They were divided into three groups: the control group (E1), the negative control group (E2), and the 100 mg/L vitamin E (E3) solution. Three different temperature points (20 °C, 10 °C, and 5 °C) were used to collect, test, and analyze the samples. The findings demonstrated that in the E3 treatment group, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, total cholesterol, urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and fatty acid synthase contents were significantly lower under cooling stress than those in the E1 and E2 treatment groups (P < 0.05). The E3 therapy group had significantly greater blood glucose, glycogen, and glycogen synthase levels than the E1 and E2 treatment groups (P < 0.05). The levels of pyruvate kinase in the E1, E2, and E3 treatment groups did not differ significantly. Crucian carp's gill tissue changed under cooling stress, including capillary dilatation, and the E3 treatment group experienced less damage overall than the E1 and E2 treatment groups. In conclusion, supplementing water with vitamin E to treat crucian carp can decrease damage, improve the body's ability to withstand cold, and slow down the stress response brought on by cooling stress. This provides a theoretical basis for supplementing water with vitamin E to fish stress relief.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is a growing concern, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant consequence. Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat NAFLD in children. However, a recent study explored the potential of vitamin E enriched with tocotrienol (TRF) as a powerful antioxidant for NAFLD. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effectiveness and safety of TRF in managing children with obesity and NAFLD. METHODS: A total of 29 patients aged 10 to 18 received a daily oral dose of 50 mg TRF for six months (January 2020 to February 2022), and all had fatty liver disease were detected by ultrasonography and abnormally high alanine transaminase levels (at least two-fold higher than the upper limits for their respective genders). Various parameters, including biochemical markers, FibroScan, LiverFASt, DNA damage, and cytokine expression, were monitored. RESULTS: APO-A1 and AST levels decreased significantly from 1.39 ± 0.3 to 1.22 ± 0.2 g/L (P = 0.002) and from 30 ± 12 to 22 ± 10 g/L (P = 0.038), respectively, in the TRF group post-intervention. Hepatic steatosis was significantly reduced in the placebo group from 309.38 ± 53.60 db/m to 277.62 ± 39.55 db/m (p = 0.048), but not in the TRF group. Comet assay analysis showed a significant reduction in the DNA damage parameters in the TRF group in the post-intervention period compared to the baseline, with tail length decreasing from 28.34 ± 10.9 to 21.69 ± 9.84; (p = 0.049) and with tail DNA (%) decreasing from 54.13 ± 22.1to 46.23 ± 17.9; (p = 0.043). Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels were significantly lower in the TRF group compared to baseline levels for IL-6 (2.10 6.3 to 0.7 1.0 pg/mL; p = 0.047 pg/mL) and TNF-1 (1.73 5.5 pg/mL to 0.7 0.5 pg/mL; p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that TRF supplementation may offer a risk-free treatment option for children with obesity and NAFLD. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of TRF offer a promising adjuvant therapy for NAFLD treatment. In combination with lifestyle modifications such as exercise and calorie restriction, TRF could play an essential role in the prevention of NAFLD in the future. However, further studies are needed to explore the long-term effects of TRF supplementation on NAFLD in children.

Despite available evidence, vitamin E is not widely used. This study aimed to assess the effect of vitamin E on serum markers of liver inflammation, specifically serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, and histology, including resolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), in adult patients with MASLD. METHODS: A systematic literature search on randomized controlled trials published in English was conducted using electronic databases. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and mean difference (MD) were used for continuous outcomes, while risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous outcomes, with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included in the qualitative synthesis while seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Vitamin E significantly reduced serum ALT and AST levels with SMD of -0.82 (95% CI, -1.13 to -0.51) and -0.68 (95% CI, -0.94 to -0.41), respectively. Vitamin E significantly reduced steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning with a MD of -0.60 (95% CI, -0.83 to -0.37), -0.34 (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.16), -0.32 (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.12), and increased MASH resolution with a RR of 1.9 (95%CI, 1.20 to 3.02). However, vitamin E did not reduce fibrosis, with a MD of -0.23 (95% CI, -0.51 to 0.05).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The notable decline in the number of Tregs within Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) intestinal tissues，contribute to excessive inflammation and necrosis, yet the precise underlying factors remain enigmatic. Ferroptosis, a novel cell death stemming from a disrupted lipid redox metabolism, is the focus of this investigation. Specifically, this study delves into the ferroptosis of Treg cells in the context of NEC and observes the protective effects exerted by vitamin E intervention, which aims to mitigate ferroptosis of Treg cells. METHODS: To investigate the reduction of Treg cells in NEC intestine, we analyzed its association with ferroptosis from multiple angles. We constructed a mouse with a specific knockout of Gpx4 in Treg cells, aiming to examine the impact of Treg cell ferroptosis on NEC intestinal injury and localized inflammation. Ultimately, we employed vitamin E treatment to mitigate ferroptosis in NEC intestine's Treg cells, monitoring the subsequent amelioration in intestinal inflammatory damage. RESULTS: The diminution of Treg cells in NEC is attributed to ferroptosis stemming from diminished GPX4 expression. Gpx4-deficient Treg cells exhibit impaired immunosuppressive function and are susceptible to ferroptosis. This ferroptosis of Treg cells exacerbates intestinal damage and inflammatory response in NEC. Notably, Vitamin E can inhibit the ferroptosis of Treg cells, subsequently alleviating intestinal damage and inflammation in NEC. Additionally, Vitamin E bolsters the anti-lipid peroxidation capability of Treg cells by upregulating the expression of GPX4. CONCLUSION: In the context of NEC, the ferroptosis of Treg cells represents a significant factor contributing to intestinal tissue damage and an exaggerated inflammatory response. GPX4 is pivotal for the viability and functionality of Treg cells. Vitamin E exhibits the capability to mitigate the ferroptosis of Treg cells, thereby enhancing their number and function, which plays a crucial role in mitigating intestinal tissue damage and inflammatory response in NEC.",

      "abstract": "Subfertility is a multifactorial disorder that affects the rabbit production industry. However, subfertility may be treated by using a simple intervention such as vitamin supplementation. Vitamin E and selenium (Se) are potent antioxidants that protect the male reproductive system. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of vitamin E and Se on testicular size, semen quality and freezability, antioxidant activity, testosterone levels, and fertility in subfertile rabbits. Twenty-one New Zealand rabbits were classified as subfertile rabbits based on their semen characteristics and fertility records. The rabbits were randomly allocated into 3 equal groups (G1: control; G2: injected with Vit E 100 IU/head + Se 0.1 mg/kg b.w.; G3: injected with Vit E 200 IU/head + Se 0.2 mg/kg b.w. once weekly for 8 weeks).Once weekly for 8 W, blood samples were collected to measure serum testosterone level and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and semen samples were collected by artificial vagina to assess the quality of fresh and frozen semen. At the 8th week of the study, 150 multiparous does were artificially inseminated with fresh semen to assess the fertility of rabbits after treatment; 50 does for each group. At the end of the study, rabbits were slaughtered to assess testicular morphometry. Fresh and post-thaw semen quality parameters were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in G3in comparison with G2and G1, respectively. Also, testosterone level was significantly (p < 0.05) increased at the 2nd week in G3in comparison with other groups. Conception and kindling rates were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in does which were inseminated with semen fromG3. In conclusion, injection of vitamin E and selenium at a higher dose (G3) improved the testicular morphology, quality of fresh and post-thaw semen, and most importantly, the fertility of subfertile rabbits.",

      "abstract": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a serious condition that may develop in patients undergoing diagnostic radiologic procedures. Several treatments have been assessed to prevent CIN development. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of vitamin E in the prevention of CIN compared to intravenous (IV) saline hydration. The literature search included MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Web of Science, ProQuest, and Scopus for articles published until May 11, 2024, without language or time limits. The outcomes included the incidence of CIN, new-onset dialysis, and death (primary), as well as the change in serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (secondary). Numerical and dichotomous outcomes were presented as standardized mean difference (SMD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Six clinical trials were included. Vitamin E was administered orally in varying doses, but one study used IV infusion. Vitamin E decreased the risk of developing CIN by 59% (n=5; pooled RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.65; P<0.001) compared to IV hydration. None of the patients required renal replacement therapy. One patient on vitamin E died due to the occurrence of acute coronary syndrome. Vitamin E is a promising effective prophylaxis against CIN. However, the number of included studies and their sample sizes are small. The studies showed several limitations. There is a need for further high-quality clinical trials to ascertain the effectiveness of vitamin E compared to IV hydration and to compare vitamin E to other therapies, such as N-acetyl cysteine."

      "abstract": "Vitamin D3 (25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (VD)) and vitamin E (VE) have proven to have immunomodulatory and antioxidant functions along with capacities to improve the reproductive function in chickens. Coccidiosis in laying hens at different stages of growth has been shown to negatively affect performance, immune response, and oxidative status, thus increasing the cost of production. A study was conducted to evaluate the influence of dietary VD or VE on performance, gut health, immune response, and oxidative status of laying hens at peak production. Laying hens (23 wk-of-age, n = 225) were randomly allocated into 5 treatment groups (n = 9 hens/replicate) with 5 replicate groups each: 1) unchallenged control (UC), 2) pair-fed control (PF), 3) challenged control (CC), 4) challenged control top-dressed with 5,000 IU of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (VD) per kg of diet, and 5) challenged control top-dressed with 100 IU of DL-α-tocopherol (VE). At 25 wk-of-age, hens grouped in CC, VD, and VE were challenged with mixed Eimeria spp. to induce coccidiosis. VD or VE supplemented hens did not impact bird body weight; however, egg production increased by 10.36% and 13.77%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the gut health of the hens was improved with either VD or VE supplementation, as indicated by lowered gut permeability and intestinal lesion scores (P < 0.05). VE significantly reduced the heterophil count (P = 0.0490) alongside numerically increasing the peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocyte counts (P > 0.05). Both VD or VE increased the TAC at 14 DPI compared to UC (P<0.05). Preliminary findings suggest that dietary VD or VE supplementation has the potential to improve gut health, modulate the immune response, and increase egg production in coccidiosis-infected laying hens.",

The biological membranes are constituted by phospholipids (PLs), and vitamin E (Vit E) protects them from oxidative stress (OS). The aim of this study was to demonstrate if treatment with Vit E restores the modified profile of the FA in PLs in serum from patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). We evaluated Vit E, total fatty acids (TFAs), fatty acids of the phospholipids (FAPLs), total phospholipids (TPLs), 8-isoprostane, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandins (PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum from 22 COVID-19 patients before and after treatment with Vit E and compared the values with those from 23 healthy subjects (HSs). COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in Vit E, TPLs, FAPLs, and TFAs in serum in comparison to HSs (p ≤ 0.01), and Vit E treatment restored their levels (p ≤ 0.04). Likewise, there was an increase in IL-6 and CRP in COVID-19 patients in comparison with HSs (p ≤ 0.001), and treatment with Vit E decreased their levels (p ≤ 0.001). Treatment with Vit E as monotherapy can contribute to restoring the modified FA profile of the PLs in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this leads to a decrease in lipid peroxidation, OS, and the inflammatory process."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our hypothesis centred on the potential to mitigate ascites outbreaks in birds exposed to cold stress by inhibiting pulmonary artery contraction through dietary intervention. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of natural and synthetic medications on growth performance, ascites-related parameters and the expression of ascites-related genes in the lung tissue of broiler chickens under low ambient temperature. METHODS: We randomly assigned 450 one-day-old male Ross 308 chicks to six dietary treatments across five replicate pens, each containing 15 chicks. The treatments included a basal diet (control), and the basal diet was supplemented with hydroalcoholic extracts of sumac (HES, 200 mg/kg), Syrian mesquite (HEM, 200 mg/kg), l-arginine (40% above requirement), captopril (15 mg/kg) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg). RESULTS: Diets containing HEM, l-arginine and vitamin E resulted in increased average daily gain on days 8-14 and 0-28, whereas HES showed a similar effect only during days 8-14 compared to the control diet (p < 0.05). Additionally, feed additives decreased packed cell volume, left and right ventricle volumes and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05). Moreover, chickens fed the control and l-arginine diets exhibited higher levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA in lung tissue compared to those fed HES, HEM and captopril (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, supplementation with HEM and l-arginine increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in lung tissue compared to other treatments (p < 0.05). Regarding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) expression, feed additives increased mRNA level in lung tissue, except for captopril (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the plant extracts may reduce the incidence of ascites syndrome not only through their antioxidant properties but also by modulating the expression of ACE, iNOS and Cu/Zn-SOD genes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the effect of proanthocyanidin, palm oil and vitamin E against erosive and erosive+abrasive challenges in vitro after enamel pellicle formation in situ. METHODOLOGY: Bovine enamel blocks (n=84) were obtained and divided into the following treatment groups: negative control (NC) - deionized water; positive control (PC) - SnCl2/NaF/AmF-containing solution; palm oil (PO); 2% proanthocyanidin (P2); vitamin E (VitE); 2% proanthocyanidin+palm oil (P2PO); and 2% proanthocyanidin+vitamin E (P2VitE). For 5 days, one half of the sample from each group was subjected to erosion and the other half was subjected to erosion+abrasion. The acquired enamel pellicle (AEP) was pre-formed in situ for 30 minutes. The specimens were then treated in vitro with solutions (500 µl, 30s for each group). Subsequently, the blocks were left in the oral cavity for another hour to obtain the modified AEP. The blocks were immersed in 0.5% citric acid (pH=2.5) for 90s, 4×/day. AEP formation and treatment were carried out before the first and third erosive challenges, and after these challenges, abrasive cycles (15s) were performed on half of the samples. Enamel wear was quantified by profilometry and data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p<0.05). RESULTS: All groups showed higher wear when exposed to erosion+abrasion than when exposed to erosion alone (p=0.0001). PO, P2VitE, P2, and P2PO showed enamel wear similar to the PC group, but only PC, PO and P2VitE differed from the NC group. The other groups behaved similarly to NC. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the combination of proanthocyanidin and vitamin E was effective in reducing wear in the face of in vitro erosive and erosive+abrasive challenges.",

The current study aimed to evaluate the anti-kindling effects of ivermectin (IVM) and rufinamide (RUFI) alone and their combination with vitamin E. The mice were administered 11 injections of PTZ (40 mg/kg) followed by assessment for anxiety-like behavior and cognitive abilities in a series of behavior tests with subsequent brain isolation for biochemical and histopathological evaluation. The outcomes showed a marked protection by IVM + RUFI (P<0.001) from kindling progression, anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficit. However, additional supplementation with vitamin E worked superior to duo therapy as these mice were noted to be most fearless to visiting open, illuminated and elevated zones of open field, light/dark and elevated-plus maze (P<0.0001). Further, they showed marked remembrance of the familiar milieu in y-maze (P<0.01) and novel objection recognition (P<0.05) tests. Additionally, their recollection of aversive stimuli in passive avoidance and spatial memory in Morris water maze were evident (P<0.0001), in comparison to kindled mice. The IVM + RUFI duo therapy and its co-administration with vitamin E prevented kindling-triggered oxidative stress in brains and neuronal damage in hippocampus. We conclude that the benefits of the co-administration of vitamin E might be the results of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin E which might be potentiating the antiseizure effects of RUFI and GABA-A modulating potential by ivermectin.",

Freshwater fish subjected to salt bath become exhausted and stressed. In this experiment, Nile tilapia were exposed to a salt bath at a dose of 30 ppt for 30 min a day. Vitamin C and vitamin E are well-known antioxidants that are used in aquaculture. Fish received dietary nanoparticles of chitosan-vitamin C and chitosan-vitamin E (CCE-NPs) for different periods (7 and 14 days) pre- (G2) and post-salt treatment (G3). In the control fish (G1), cortisol 5.44 µg/dL and glucose 91.67 mg/dL were significantly up-regulated post-salt treatment by 1 h and 24 h, respectively, whereas those (G2) fed CCE-NPs diet had significantly lower values of 4.72 and 3.25 µg/dL; 86.3 and 84.3 mg/dL, respectively. A rapid decrease of glucose 68.3 and 66.3 mg/dL was noticed in those (G2) fed CCE-NPs diet compared to the control 84.67 mg/dL at 48 h post-stress. Regardless of the supplementation period, fish (G2) could partially restore normal food reflex at 48 h (post-salt bath) and fully restored at 72 h compared to 7 days in the control (G1). After 48 h, fish that received dietary CCE-NPs (G2 and G3) restored normal mucus lysozyme levels, whereas the control did not restore pre-treatment values till the seventh day. Mucus antibacterial activity, fish received rapid dietary CCE-NPs (G2) and partially restored average values (pre-salt bath) at 96 h. The salt treatment could provoke gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis (TNF)-α in the head kidney of fish at 24 h post-salt bath to 5.9-8.35 fold-change, respectively, with a rapid decline in fish (G2) the gene expression. Post-salt bath (24 h), the gene expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) was higher in fish (G2) than in the control group (G1) regardless of the supplementation period (7 and 14 days). Bacterial infection S. agalactiae (OL471408), a significantly lower MR was recorded in G2 at 40% and 33.3% compared to the control G1 MR (53.3%), with an RPL of 24.95% and 37.5%. In conclusion, Nile tilapia treated with a 30 ppt salt became more vulnerable to S. agalactiae. Adding CCE-NPs to the Nile tilapia diet for 7- and 14-day pre-salt bath could increase immune and antioxidant-related gene expression to counteract S. agalactiae infection.",

The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of DHA + vitamin E versus placebo in reducing hepatic fat fraction (%) relative to baseline after 6 months of intervention. Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of vitamin E or DHA alone versus placebo on reducing liver fat at 6 months. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 203 subjects with a mean age of 51 years, 53% female, 91% White, 59% Hispanic ethnicity. The combination of vitamin E + DHA had no effect on the primary endpoint of reducing hepatic steatosis as determined by MRI-PDFF (p = 0.98). Neither vitamin E alone (p = 0.91) nor DHA alone (p = 0.14) significantly reduced hepatic steatosis compared to placebo. However, the trial was not powered adequately for this analysis. Compared with placebo, no statistically significant differences were detected in the 3-month or 6-month levels for ALT (U/L) or AST (U/L) in all three intervention groups.

      "abstract": "It is known that the inflammation process leading to oxidative stress and thyroid hormone metabolism dysfunction is highly altered in metabolic dysfunction associated with steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This study aims to address the effect of ornithine aspartate (LOLA) and vitamin E (VitE) in improving these processes. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to five groups and treated for 28 weeks: controls (n = 10) received a standard diet (for 28 weeks) plus gavage with distilled water (DW) from weeks 16 to 28. MASLD groups received a high-fat and choline-deficient diet for 28 weeks (MASLD group) and daily gavage with 200 mg/kg/day of LOLA, or twice a week with 150 mg of VitE from weeks 16-28. LOLA diminished collagen deposition (p = 0.006). The same treatment diminished carbonyl, TBARS, and sulfhydryl levels and GPx activity (p < 0.001). Type 3 deiodinase increased in the MASLD group, downregulating T3-controlled genes, which was corrected in the presence of LOLA. LOLA also promoted a near-normalization of complex II, SDH, and GDH activities (p < 0.001) and improved reticulum stress, with a reduction in GRP78 and HSPA9/GRP75 protein levels (p < 0.05). The enhanced energy production and metabolism of thyroid hormones, probably because of GSH replenishment provided by the L-glutamate portion of LOLA, opens a new therapeutic approach for MASLD.",

Our aim was to compare serum lipidomic profile between patients with NAFLD having received monotherapy with vitamin E (400 IU/d) and those having received combination therapy with vitamin E (400 IU/d) and low-dose spironolactone (25 mg/d) for 52 weeks. Methods: This was a post hoc study of a randomized controlled trial (NCT01147523). Serum lipidomic analysis was performed in vitamin E monotherapy group (n = 15) and spironolactone plus vitamin E combination therapy group (n = 12). We employed an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry lipid profiling approach in positive and negative ionization mode. Results: Univariate analysis revealed 36 lipid molecules statistically different between groups in positive mode and seven molecules in negative mode. Multivariate analysis in negative mode identified six lipid molecules that remained robustly different between groups. After adjustment for potential confounders, including gender, omega-3 supplementation, leptin concentration and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), four lipid molecules remained significant between groups: FA 20:5, SM 34:2;O2, SM 42:3;O2 and CE 22:6, all being higher in the combination treatment group. Conclusions: The combination of spironolactone with vitamin E led to higher circulating levels of four lipid molecules than vitamin E monotherapy, after adjustment for potential confounders. Owing to very limited relevant data, we could not support that these changes in lipid molecules may be beneficial or not for the progression of NAFLD. Thus, mechanistic studies are warranted to clarify the potential clinical significance of these findings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to investigate the effect of vitamin E supplementation as an addition to a commercial renal diet on survival time of cats with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, we were interested whether vitamin E supplementation affects selected oxidative stress and clinical parameters. Thirty-four cats with CKD and 38 healthy cats were included in the study. Cats with CKD were classified according to the IRIS Guidelines; seven in IRIS stage 1, 15 in IRIS stage 2, five in IRIS stage 3 and seven in IRIS stage 4. Cats with CKD were treated according to IRIS Guidelines. Cats with CKD were randomly assigned to receive vitamin E (100 IU/cat/day) or placebo (mineral oil) for 24 weeks in addition to standard therapy. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) concentrations, DNA damage of peripheral lymphocytes and plasma vitamin E concentrations were measured at baseline and four, eight, 16 and 24 weeks thereafter. Routine laboratory analyses and assessment of clinical signs were performed at each visit. RESULTS: Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on the survival time and did not reduce the severity of clinical signs. Before vitamin E supplementation, no significant differences in vitamin E, MDA and PC concentrations were found between healthy and CKD cats. However, plasma MDA concentration was statistically significantly higher (p = 0.043) in cats with early CKD (IRIS stages 1 and 2) than in cats with advanced CKD (IRIS stages 3 and 4). Additionally, DNA damage was statistically significantly higher in healthy cats (p ≤ 0.001) than in CKD cats. Plasma vitamin E concentrations increased statistically significantly in the vitamin E group compared to the placebo group four (p = 0.013) and eight (p = 0.017) weeks after the start of vitamin E supplementation. During the study and after 24 weeks of vitamin E supplementation, plasma MDA and PC concentrations and DNA damage remained similar to pre-supplementation levels in both the placebo and vitamin E groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E supplementation as an addition to standard therapy does not prolong survival in feline CKD.",

Extracorporeal circulation was performed for 6 h in continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration mode using a hemofilter for CRRT filled with a polysulfone hollow fiber membrane or ViLIFE, and the differences in inflammatory reactions were evaluated. RESULTS: The ViLIFE group exhibited low platelet and cytokine levels (p < 0.05 vs. sham-CRRT group). Additionally, the ViLIFE group had lower lactate and high mobility group box 1 levels than the other groups. CONCLUSION: ViLIFE represents a promising CRRT modality that can inhibit the inflammatory response in circulation and inhibit further biological invasions.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Genitourinary syndrome, previously defined as vulvovaginal atrophy, manifests with signs and symptoms deriving from estrogen diminution in the female genitourinary tract. Stable ozonides are derivatives of artemisinin found to be stable against strong basic and acidic conditions. Vitamin E is an important antioxidant diminishing the output of reactive oxygen species in the oxidation of fats and the emanation of free radicals, reducing cellular injury and aging. The primary aim of the present study was to assess the positive effects of an ozonide plus a vitamin E acetate-based compound (Ozoile) on genitourinary syndrome symptom relief after a maximum of 20 days of treatment. Materials and Methods: The inclusion criteria for patients' enrollment were women of child-bearing age or in menopause reporting genitourinary syndrome's related symptoms, such as pain, burning, a bad smell, dyspareunia, dryness, itching, bleeding, and nervousness. The exclusion criteria were Sjogren's syndrome and patients administered retinoic acid, an agent that causes mucosal dryness. Participants completed a questionnaire before and after 20 days of treatment. Results: The incidence of pain decreased from 16.7% to 11.8% (p-value < 0.0001). In addition, the mean symptom intensity decreased from 2.10 to 0.87 (p-value < 0.0001). Dryness was the most frequent pre-treatment symptom and decreased from 85.5% to 53.8% (p-value < 0.0001) (mean: 2.21 vs. 0.90; p-value < 0.0001). Conclusions: Ozoile was effective in reducing most gynecologic symptoms related to genitourinary syndrome. However, further studies are needed to compare its effect with other standards of care.",

Here we investigated the underlying mechanistic effect of oxidative stress on light-mediated vasodilation by using pressure myography on dissected murine arteries and immunofluorescence on endothelial cells. Treatment with antioxidants Trolox and catalase decreased vessel dilation. In the presence of catalase, a lower number of exosomes were detected in the vessel bath. Light exposure resulted in increased cellular free radical levels. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were also more abundant but did not alter cellular ATP production. Red light enhanced the co-localization of late exosome marker CD63 and cellular S-nitrosoprotein to a greater extent than high glucose, suggesting that a mild oxidative stress favors the localization of NO precursor in late exosomes. Exocytosis regulating protein Rab11 was more abundant after irradiation. Our findings conclude that red-light-induced gentle oxidative stress facilitates the dilation of blood vessels, most likely through empowering the traffic of vasodilatory substances. Application of antioxidants disfavors this mechanism."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate whether the addition of vitamins E and C as two conventional antioxidants improves the cryotolerance of preantral follicles enclosed in ovine ovarian tissue slices. For this purpose, ovarian slices were obtained from abattoired juvenile lambs and randomly distributed to the following groups: fresh, toxicity, vitriﬁed (control), and three treatment groups in two experiments. Vitamin E, vitamin C, or vitamin E + C was added to the vitriﬁcation media alone in the first experiment and added to all vitrification, warming, and culture media in the second experiment. Finally, the treated tissues were cultured in vitro for 12 hours. The histological analysis showed that single or combined use of vitamins E and C increases intact preantral follicles in comparison to the control in two experiments (p < 0.05), and simultaneous use of vitamins E and C had a synergistic effect on increasing the percentage of normal preantral follicles in experiment 2 (p < 0.05). Due to the better results in Experiment 2, stromal cell density, antioxidant activity, and molecular evaluation were followed only in this experiment. The vitamin E + C group had higher stromal cell density compared with control group (p < 0.05). Vitamin E strengthened antioxidant capacity compared with the control and vitamin C groups (p < 0.05). This effect was exacerbated when used in combination with vitamin C (p < 0.05). The expression of all evaluated genes (BMP4, BMP15, GDF9, and KITLG) was significantly increased in ovarian tissue treated with vitamin E + C compared with the control group (p < 0.05). This increase was also observed in BMP4, GDF9, and KITLG genes compared with the vitamin C group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study revealed the positive effects of vitamins E and C on preantral follicle viability and to some extent a synergistic action of vitamin C on the protective effects of vitamin E against preantral follicle degeneration and increasing antioxidant capacity and development of preantral follicles after ovine ovarian tissue vitrification.",

We found that knockdown of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene led to subsequent activation of Wnt signaling in colon epithelial cells (NCM460-APCsiRNA) and induction of β-catenin and its downstream target proteins c-MYC, cyclin D1, and survivin. When aspirin and DT3 were combined, cell growth and survival were inhibited and apoptosis was induced in colon epithelial cells and CCSCs. However, DT3 and/or aspirin had little or no effect on the control of normal colon epithelial cells (NCM460-NCsiRNA). The induction of apoptosis was directly related to the activation of caspase 8 and cleavage of BH3-interacting-domain (BID) to truncated BID. In addition, DT3- and/or aspirin-induced apoptosis was associated with cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), elevated levels of cytosolic cytochrome c and BAX, and depletion of antiapoptotic protein BCl-2 in CCSCs. The combination of aspirin and DT3 inhibited the self-renewal capacity, Wnt/β-catenin receptor activity, and expression of β-catenin and its downstream targets c-MYC, cyclin D1, and survivin in CCSCs. We also found that treatment with DT3 alone or combined with aspirin significantly inhibited intestinal adenoma formation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and induced apoptosis, compared with vehicle, in APCmin/+ mice. Our study demonstrated a rationale for further investigation of the combination of DT3 and aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention and therapy.",

METHODS: Forty-eight rats were divided into six groups: Control, Swimming, Swimming + vitamin E, Swimming + Epilepsy, Swimming + Epilepsy + vitamin E, and Epilepsy. Vitamin E was administered to the animals chronically by gavage at a dose of 500 mg/kg every other day for 3 months. Epileptiform activity was induced with penicillin in animals 24 hours after the last vitamin E intake. The exercise program consisted of daily 30-minute swimming sessions. At the end of the treatment period, the levels of calcium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, lead, and zinc (µg/gram tissue) in bone tissue samples were measured using an atomic emission device. RESULTS: The results showed that all epileptic groups had significantly lower bone chromium levels compared to the control groups (p<0.05). The epileptic, and epileptic swimming groups had the lowest levels of bone calcium, magnesium, and zinc (p<0.05). Vitamin E administration resulted in a significant increase in bone calcium, magnesium, and zinc levels in the epileptic swimming group with vitamin E compared to the epileptic and epileptic swimming groups. (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings of the study show that the administration of vitamin E improves calcium, magnesium, and zinc metabolism in the deteriorated bone tissue of the epileptic rat model."

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness and vision impairment worldwide and represents one of the most common complications among diabetic patients. Current treatment modalities for DR, including laser photocoagulation, intravitreal injection of corticosteroid, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, target primarily vascular lesions. However, these approaches are invasive and have several limitations, such as potential loss of visual function, retinal scars and cataract formation, and increased risk of ocular hypertension, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and intraocular inflammation. Recent studies have suggested mitochondrial dysfunction as a pivotal factor leading to both the vascular and neural damage in DR. Given that Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a proven mitochondrial stabilizer with antioxidative properties, this study investigated the effect of CoQ10 eyedrops [in conjunction with vitamin E d-α-tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol) 1000 succinate (TPGS)] on DR-induced neurodegeneration using a type 2 diabetes mouse model (C57BLKsJ-db/db mice). Utilizing a comprehensive electroretinography protocol, supported by immunohistochemistry, our results revealed that topical application of CoQ10 eyedrops conjugated with vitamin E TPGS produced a neuroprotective effect against diabetic-induced neurodegeneration by preserving the function and histology of various retinal neural cell types. Compared to the control group, mice treated with CoQ10 exhibited thicker outer and inner nuclear layers, higher densities of photoreceptor, cone cell, and rod-bipolar cell dendritic boutons, and reduced glial reactivity and microglial cell density. Additionally, the CoQ10 treatment significantly alleviated retinal levels of MMP-9 and enhanced mitochondrial function. These findings provide further insight into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of DR and suggest CoQ10 eyedrops, conjugated with vitamin E TPGS, as a potential complementary therapy for DR-related neuropathy."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Some age-related testicular changes, such as Sertoli cell vacuolization and blood-testis barrier breakdown, reduce total sperm production and male fertility. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of vitamin E on restoring testicular function in aged mice. Sperm cryo-resistance was also assessed. METHODS: Twenty-eight 48-week-old male Naval Medical Research Institute mice were divided into four groups for a daily gavage of vitamin E: the control group received distilled water, while the three treatment groups were administered 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, respectively, for 4 weeks. Subsequently, semen analyses, DNA fragmentation index (DFI), and protamine deficiency tests were conducted. Testicular histology, tissue antioxidant enzyme activity, and gene expression levels were also assessed. RESULTS: The two higher dosages of vitamin E were associated with a higher sperm count, greater progressive motility, and improved sperm morphology (p<0.05). These benefits were also evident after sperm freezing (p<0.05). Although chromatin abnormalities increased following vitrification, the treatment groups showed better outcomes (p<0.05). The tubular diameter, epithelium height, and luminal diameters remained unchanged with age. The tissue antioxidant capacity was greater in the groups receiving the high doses of vitamin E. Additionally, significant increases in inhibitor of DNA binding protein-4 (Id4) and GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (Gfra1) expression were observed in the higher vitamin E dosage groups, and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (Plzf) expression was notably present in the 400 mg/kg treatment group compared to the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Antioxidant supplementation might enhance reproductive outcomes in aging males. The observed effects included improved sperm cryo-resistance, which is advantageous for future applications such as sperm freezing or fertility preservation."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bacterial vaginitis (BV) is a common vaginal disease. Vitamin E has been shown to reduce BV by enhancing immune function, but no studies have analyzed the relationship between vitamin E and BV at different BMIs and ages. METHOD: This study used 2242 participants from four cycles of NHANES 1999-2006 in American. Participants' vitamin E levels were divided into four groups, and analyses such as study population description, stratified analysis, multiple logistic regression analysis, and curve fitting were performed. To perform data processing, the researchers used the statistical package R (The R Foundation; http://www.r-project.org ; version 3.6.3) and Empower Stats software ( www.empowerstats.net , X&Y solutions, Inc. Boston, Massachusetts). RESULT: The concentrations of serum vitamin E were negatively correlated with the risk of BV, especially when vitamin E were at 1198-5459ug/dL with (OR = -0.443, 95%CI = 0.447-0.923, P = 0.032) or without (OR = -0.521, 95%CI = 0.421-0.837, P = 0.006) adjustment for variables. At the same time, at lower levels, there was no significant association. Vitamin E supplementation may significantly reduce the risk of BV (p < 0.001). In addition, the risk of having BV decreased and then increased with increasing vitamin E concentrations at high BMI levels (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Vitamin E at moderate to high concentrations may significantly reduce BV risk, says the study, providing clinical evidence for the prevention and the treatment of BV.",

There is an urgent need to develop a proper and cost-effective therapeutic modality that can reverse and/or ameliorate lung fibrosis. Vitamin E is one of the widely investigated dietary antioxidants which has been linked to improvement of many health problems. The current study was conducted to evaluate the possible roles of vitamin E in prevention and treatment of bleomycin (BLM) induced lung fibrosis. Physiological, anatomical, histopathological and immunohistochemical studies were done to assess and compare between the structure and function of the lung tissue in lung fibrosis model, early and late treated groups with vitamin E. Furthermore, measurement of transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β), E-cadherin, Smad-3, BAX, BCL2, malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were done. The study revealed that administration of vitamin E helped to improve signs of lung fibrosis, as reflected by amelioration of structure and functions of lungs as well as the decrease in TGF-β levels and inhibition of α-SMA/collagen I profibrotic pathway. These findings highlight the importance of administration of vitamin E as a prophylactic agent prior to BLM therapy and as an adjuvant treatment in cases of lung fibrosis.",

Histopathologic changes and the flow cytometric apoptotic index were evaluated for liver tissue. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparisons between groups. The statistical significance level was accepted as p < 0.05. RESULTS: In the histopathological analysis, hepatocyte degeneration, dilatation of sinusoids, mononuclear cell infiltration, hydropic degeneration in hepatocytes, vacuolization, and pycnotic nucleus were observed in the MTX group. In the MTX + vitamin E group, hepatocyte degeneration, pycnotic nuclei, and dilatation in sinusoids were significantly lower compared to the MTX group. In the MTX group, glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes was lower compared to the control group. In the MTX + vitamin E group, glycogen accumulation in hepatocy-tes was higher compared to the MTX group. The flowcytometric apoptotic index (AI) percentage in the MTX group was 34.4% and in the MTX + vitamin E group the value was 9.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that vitamin E ameliorates MTX-induced liver damage. Co-using vitamin E and MTX drugs will be beneficial for the treatment of various diseases."

According to many clinical studies, elevated blood bilirubin and low vitamin E (VE) levels in newborns are associated. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of oxidative stress of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in patients who underwent phototherapy with additional vitamin E supplementation (25 mg/kg/day over the course of three days) and patients without additional vitamin E. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A set of 100 neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia patients was enrolled at neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of the pediatric departments at Al Azhar University Hospitals during the period from February 2021 to October 2022 after obtaining signed written informed consent of all neonates' parents with an explanation of the aim of study. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the studied groups regarding serum bilirubin on the third day of admission (p = 0.039). Patients who were treated with vitamin E had lower serum bilirubin on the third day of admission (8.25 ±3.41) than the control group (11.66 ±3.22). Also, among the VE group, serum bilirubin was significantly decreased on the third day of admission (8.25 ±3.41) compared to zero days of admission (14.10 ±4.39) (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E supplementation has an important role in treatment of indirect hyperbilirubinemia in neonates. Early administration of vitamin E in preterm neonates resulted in a significant decrease of serum bilirubin and increased total antioxidant capacity. Vitamin E supplementation in full term decreased the duration of phototherapy."

Despite their prevalence, effective treatment options remain limited. Evening primrose oil (EPO) and vitamin E have been proposed as potential therapies for cyclical mastalgia; however, their efficacy remains uncertain, particularly when used in combination. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of EPO, vitamin E, and their combination in alleviating breast pain associated with cyclical mastalgia through a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Premenopausal women (n=126) with cyclical mastalgia were recruited from gynecology clinics and randomized to receive EPO (1000 mg twice daily), vitamin E (400 mg once daily), their combination, or a placebo for six months. Randomization was performed using computer-generated random numbers. Participants were assessed at baseline and monthly intervals for six months. The primary outcome was the change in breast pain severity measured using a validated pain questionnaire such as the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire. The secondary outcomes included changes in breast pain characteristics, adverse effects, and treatment adherence. RESULTS: A total of 126 participants participated in this study. The combination of EPO and vitamin E demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing breast pain severity compared with individual treatments and placebo (p < 0.001). Participants in the combination group experienced a mean reduction in breast pain severity of 4.5 points on the pain scale, whereas those in the EPO and vitamin E groups experienced reductions of 2.5 and 3.0 points, respectively. Both EPO and vitamin E alone also showed significant improvements compared with placebo (p < 0.05), with mean reductions in breast pain severity of 2.0 and 2.5 points, respectively. Adverse effects were minimal and comparable across the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with EPO and vitamin E appears to be an effective treatment option for cyclical mastalgia, offering superior pain relief compared with individual treatments and placebo."

Suckling piglets (n = 24) were randomly selected from two litters for an oral supplementation (1 mL/day) with fish oil or hemp oil and vitamin E supplementation (60 mg natural vitamin E/mL oil) from day 10 to 28 of age. At day 29 and 30 of age, each piglet was orally inoculated with 6.7 × 108 and 3.96 × 108 CFU of F4 and F18 E. coli, respectively. Blood was sampled from all piglets on day 28 before E. coli challenge and on day 35 of age to investigate immunological and oxidative stress markers in plasma. One week after weaning and exposure to E. coli, a general reduction in the α-tocopherol concentration and activity of GPX1 was obtained. Vitamin E supplementation lowered the extent of lipid peroxidation and improved the antioxidative status and immune responses after E. coli challenge. Hemp oil had the greatest effect on antioxidant enzyme activity. Provision of hemp oil and vitamin E to suckling piglets may reduce the incidence of post-weaning diarrhea.",

This study explored potential fluorescence quenching reversal effects of a water-soluble vitamin E conjugate (d-α-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate, TPGS) when applied to polymicrobial biofilms grown on dentine that had been exposed to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) to cause quenching. METHOD: Extracted human teeth were debrided, embedded in transparent acrylic resin and sectioned. After smear layer removal, tooth dentine sections were inoculated with a polymicrobial inoculum, and cultured for 7 days to create biofilms. Samples (n = 8 per group) were exposed to 1 % or 4 % NaOCl for 2 or 4 min, and then treated with TPGS. Bacterial fluorescence readings under laser excitation at 655 nm were assessed over 10 min using a calibrated DIAGNOdent device. All data were assessed for normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and analysed with ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests. RESULTS: NaOCl at both concentrations quenched fluorescence readings of biofilms grown on dentine samples, with a maximal reduction of 40.4 % at 5 min after 4 % NaOCl. Treatment with TPGS gave faster recovery of fluorescence readings compared to the control at 5 and 10 min. CONCLUSION: The water-soluble antioxidant TPGS partially reversed fluorescence quenching caused by NaOCl. This agent may have value clinically for reducing the time needed for fluorescence readings to recover when NaOCl is used as an irrigant. This will facilitate more accurate assessment of endpoints for canal debridement.",

The study aims to determine the effect of supplementing biogenic selenium (Se) from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, ADS18 (ADS18) in laying hens' diet on yolk lipid oxidation status (MDA), beta-carotene (β-carotene) content, cholesterol, fatty acids, Se, and vitamin E (VE) level. A total of one hundred and twenty (120) laying hens of Lohmann Brown strains aged 50 weeks, weighing 1500 to 2000 g were reared individually in A-shape two-tier stainless-steel cages sized 30 cm x 50 cm x 40 cm (width, depth height). The hens were randomly allotted into four treatments with six replications in a complete randomised design for the period of 12 weeks. The basal diet contains 100 mg/kg VE. Treatment diets consist of basal diet as control, SS containing 0.3 mg/kg sodium selenite, Se-yeast containing 0.3 mg/kg selenised yeast, and VADS18 containing 0.3 mg/kg of ADS18. Forty-eight eggs were collected and freeze-dried biweekly for analysis. The results of the present study showed that hens supplemented ADS18 had significantly (P < 0.05) lower MDA and cholesterol levels while their egg yolks had higher levels of Se and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). The control group had significantly (P < 0.05) higher saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents than the VE and dietary Se-supplemented groups, while the ADS18 group had the lowest SFA contents. Conversely, in comparison to the inorganic and control groups, the VE content of the egg yolk was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in organic Se-supplemented (Se-yeast and VADS18) groups. Hens with SS supplementation had significantly (P < 0.05) higher egg yolk β-carotene content. When compared to other treatment groups, the control group had higher (P < 0.05) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content. The ADS18 is therefore deemed comparable to other Se sources. To prevent Se toxicity, however, a better understanding of the levels of ADS18 incorporation in poultry diets is required.",

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of combining carbimazole (CBZ) with vitamin E (VE) on testicular injury induced by experimental hyperthyroidism in adult albino rats, focusing on oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic pathways. In this experimental study, 64 adult male albino Wistar rats were divided into eight groups: Group I (control-untreated), Group II (CBZ-control), Group III (VE-control), Group IV (CBZ + VE-control), Group V (levothyroxine-induced testicular injury), Group VI (levothyroxine + CBZ-treated), Group VII (levothyroxine + VE-treated), and Group VIII (levothyroxine + CBZ + VE-treated). The study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University (Ismailia, Egypt). After cervical decapitation, both testes and epididymis were examined histopathologically and immunohistochemically. Significant differences were observed among groups concerning malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT; all P < 0.001). Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed significant differences in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α ), interleukin-10 (IL-10), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl2), p53, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- κ B) mRNA levels (all P < 0.001). Hyperthyroid group treated with CBZ alone (Group VI) exhibited testicular side effects, affecting seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis. However, the Group VIII showed improved spermatogenesis and a decrease in testicular side effects. The addition of VE to the treatment of hyperthyroid rats with CBZ reduced testicular side effects and seminiferous tubular affection when potentially improving spermatogenesis. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms fully.",

Saroglitazar, a novel dual peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor ɑ/γ agonist, is approved in India for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). No head-to-head comparative study for vitamin E and saroglitazar is available. We studied the efficacy and safety of saroglitazar and vitamin E in NAFLD/NASH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively randomised 175 NAFLD patients into four arms as Saroglitazar 4 mg daily alone (n = 44), vitamin E 800IU daily alone (n = 41), vitamin E and saroglitazar combination (n = 47), and control arm (n = 43). All the baseline variables including liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) were recorded. Reassessment was done after 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The mean age and body mass index was 45 ± 11 years and 26 ± 3.6 kg/m2, respectively. Compared to control, the decrease in alanine amino transferase levels with saroglitazar, vitamin E, and combination therapy was significant (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.27-28.25, P = 0.002, 95% CI: -3.39 to 18.88, P = 0.047 and 95% CI: 8.10-29.54, P = 0.001, respectively). The reduction in CAP was significant with saroglitazar and combination therapy (95% CI: -31.94 to 11.99, P = 0.015 and 95% CI: -10.48 to 30.51, P = 0.026, respectively). Only combination therapy shows significant reduction in LSM (95% CI: 0.41-1.68, P = 0.001). Among glycaemic parameters, both saroglitazar alone and combination therapy significantly improved glycosylated haemoglobin levels (P = 0.001 and P = 0.015, respectively), and only combination therapy significantly improved homoeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (P = 0.047). Saroglitazar alone showed significant reduction in triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein levels (P = 0.038 and P = 0.018, respectively), and combination therapy showed significant increase in high-density lipoprotein levels (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Combination of Saroglitazar and vitamin E showed statistically significant reduction of LSM and CAP along with biochemical, glycaemic, and lipid parameters.

      "abstract": "High levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) during the transition period lead to increased oxidative stress and immunosuppression in cows. Feeding them a vitamin-E-supplemented diet reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the blood and diminishes immunosuppression in the transition period. However, whether the restoration of immune cell function occurs through the direct action of vitamin E in cells is still a topic that requires further discussion. Therefore, in this experiment, we aimed to investigate the effect of NEFAs on peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and whether vitamin E mitigates the impact of NEFAs. We employed three groups: (1) blank, (2) NEFA only, and (3) pre-culturing with vitamin E before NEFA treatment (VENEFA). In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), there were no differences in vitamin E content among the three groups. However, in the vitamin E pre-treatment group, the vitamin E levels of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were significantly higher than those in the other two groups. NEFA levels increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in PBMCs, but pre-treatment with vitamin E reduced accumulation of MDA levels. Regarding the expression of proinflammatory genes, NEFAs increased the expression of interleukin-1β in PBMCs and colony-stimulating factor 2 in PMNs. Vitamin E pre-treatment restored the increase in interleukin-1β levels caused by NEFAs in PBMCs. None of the groups affected the phagocytosis of PMNs. Few studies have confirmed that NEFAs cause oxidative stress in bovine PBLs. In summary, this study found that NEFAs induce oxidative stress in PBLs and alter the expression of inflammation-related genes; meanwhile, vitamin E can reduce some of the effects caused by NEFAs. This result may suggest that vitamin E can assist bovine PBLs in resisting the immune suppression caused by an NEB during the transition period."

Oxidative stress damage and inflammation are major risk factors for IBD. Vitamin E has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Our previous work and other investigations have shown that vitamin E has a positive effect on the prevention and treatment of IBD. In this paper, the source and structure of vitamin E and the potential mechanism of vitamin E's role in IBD were summarized, and we also analyzed the status of vitamin E deficiency in patients with IBD and the effect of vitamin E supplementation on IBD. The potential mechanisms by which vitamin E plays a role in the prevention and treatment of IBD include improvement of oxidative damage, enhancement of immunity, maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity, and suppression of inflammatory cytokines, modulating the gut microbiota and other relevant factors. The review will improve our understanding of the complex mechanism by which vitamin E inhibits IBD, and it also provides references for doctors in clinical practice and researchers in this field."

      "abstract": "Anthracycline antibiotics, namely, doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin, are among the most widely used anticancer therapies, yet are notoriously associated with severe myocardial damage due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Studies have indicated the strong pharmacological properties of Berberine (Brb) alkaloid, predominantly mediated via mitochondrial functions and nuclear networks. Despite the recent emphasis on Brb in clinical cardioprotective studies, pharmaceutical limitations hamper its clinical use. A nanoformulation for Brb was developed (mMic), incorporating a cationic lipid, oleylamine (OA), into the TPGS-mixed corona of PEGylated-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) micelles. Cationic TPGS/PEG-PE mMic with superior Brb loading and stability markedly enhanced both intracellular and mitochondria-tropic Brb activities in cardiovascular muscle cells. Sub-lethal doses of Brb via cationic OA/TPGS mMic, as a DOX co-treatment, resulted in significant mitochondrial apoptosis suppression. In combination with an intense DOX challenge (up to ~50 µM), mitochondria-protective Brb-OA/TPGS mMic showed a significant 24 h recovery of cell viability (p ≤ 0.05-0.01). Mechanistically, the significant relative reduction in apoptotic caspase-9 and elevation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 seem to mediate the cardioprotective role of Brb-OA/TPGS mMic against DOX. Our report aims to demonstrate the great potential of cationic OA/TPGS-mMic to selectively enhance the protective mitohormetic effect of Brb to mitigate DOX cardiotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal associated with osteoporosis, liver, and kidney disease. The black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens may be exposed to Cd during the transformation of livestock manure. The BSF has a high tolerance to Cd. In the previous work of the laboratory, we found that vitamin E (VE) may play a role in the tolerance of BSF to Cd exposure. The main findings are as follows: The BSF larvae pretreated with exogenous VE had heavier body weight, lower content and toxicity of Cd under similar Cd exposure. Even in high Cd exposure at the concentrations of 300 and 700 mg/kg, the BSF larvae pretreated with exogenous VE at a concentration of 100 mg/kg still reduced the Cd toxicity to 85.33 % and 84.43 %, respectively. The best-fitting models showed that metallothionein (MT) content, oxidative damage (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine content, malondialdehyde content), antioxidant power (total antioxidant power, peroxidase activity) had a great influence on content and toxicity of Cd bioaccumulated in the larvae. The degree of oxidative damage was reduced in the larvae with exogenous VE pretreatments. This variation can be explained by their changed MT content and increased antioxidant power because of exogenous VE. These results reveal the roles of VE in insects defense against Cd exposure and provide a new option for the prevention and therapy of damage caused by Cd exposure.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Phthalates (PEs) could cause reproductive harm to males. A mixture of three widely used PEs (MPEs) was used to investigate the ameliorative effects of zinc (Zn) and vitamin E (VE) against male reproductive toxicity. METHODS: Fifty male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10). Rats in MPEs group were orally treated with 160 mg/kg/d MPEs, while rats in MPEs combined Zn and/or VE groups were treated with 160 mg/kg/d MPEs plus 25 mg/kg/d Zn and/or 25 mg/kg/d VE. After intervention for 70 days, it's was measured of male reproductive organs' weight, histopathological observation of sperms and testes, serum hormones, PIWI proteins and steroidogenic proteins. RESULTS: Compared with control, anogenital distance, testes weight, epididymides weight, and sex hormones were significantly decreased, while the sperm malformation rate was markedly increased in MPEs group (p < .05); the testicular tissues were injured in MPEs group with disordered and decreased spermatids, and arrested spermatogenesis. PIWIL1, PIWIL2, StAR, CYP11A1 and CYP19A1 were down-regulated in MPEs group (p < .05). However, the alterations of these parameters were restored in MPEs combined Zn and/or VE groups (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Zn and/or VE improved steroid hormone metabolism, and inhibited MPEs' male reproductive toxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sexual satisfaction is a crucial part of a fulfilled life, and the ability to have satisfying sexual function is crucial to one's sexual health. This study investigated the effect of the combined administration of saffron and vitamin E and vitamin E alone on the sexual function of women in their reproductive years. METHODS: A triple-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 50 participants experiencing sexual dysfunction without comorbid sleep disorders or severe depression. They were allocated into two groups using a block randomization method (stratified based on the severity of moderate or mild/normal depression). During the 8-week intervention period, participants in the experimental group were administered a 15 mg saffron capsule (safrotin) in the morning and a combination capsule containing 15 mg saffron and 50 mg vitamin E (safradide) in the evening. During the same period, the control group consumed one saffron placebo capsule in the morning and one capsule containing 50 mg of vitamin E and saffron placebo in the evening (in identical appearance to safradide). The Female Sexual Function Index was used to assess sexual function, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to measure levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. These measures were administered at baseline as well as four and eight weeks post-intervention, with an additional measurement taken four weeks after the intervention ceased. The repeated measures ANOVA, ANCOVA, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the groups. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the experimental group (saffron and vitamin E) demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the overall mean score of sexual function compared to the control group (placebo of saffron and vitamin E) (adjusted mean difference (AMD): 4.6; 95%CI: 3.1 to 6.1; p < 0.001). The mean scores for sexual function dimensions, namely libido, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, except for pain, were consistently higher than those of the control group across all time points (p < 0.001). Additionally, the mean score for lubrication was significantly higher only at the eighth-week measurement (p = 0.004). The mean depression score in the experimental group was significantly lower than in the control group at all-time points, i.e., four (p = 0.011) and eight weeks after the intervention (p = 0.005), and four weeks after the end of the intervention (p = 0.007). The experimental group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in mean anxiety score compared to the control group at four weeks into the intervention (p = 0.016) and four weeks following the end of the intervention (p = 0.002). At eight weeks post-intervention, however, there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.177). Additionally, the experimental group exhibited a significant reduction in the overall mean stress score compared to the control group after the intervention (AMD: -2.3; 95%CI: -3.1 to -1.5; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Using the combination of saffron and vitamin E is more effective in improving sexual function and its domains compared to vitamin E alone in women of reproductive age with sexual dysfunction without severe depression. Also, it diminishes the degree of depression, anxiety, and stress more compared to vitamin E alone. However, further research is required to arrive at a more definitive conclusion.

      "abstract": "In recent years, temperatures have increased globally, and nestlings of many bird species are likely regularly exposed to increased temperatures both pre- and postnatally. Even small increases in nest temperature during incubation affect offspring growth and survival in a variety of species, one cause of which is thought to be increased production of prooxidants in embryos and nestlings. Defences marshalled in response to this oxidative stress could, in turn, result in trade-offs that lead to reduced survival or growth. If so, any downstream negative effects on nestlings of increased ambient temperatures during incubation could be counteracted by increasing their antioxidant intake. We predicted, therefore, that dietary supplements of an antioxidant would reduce or eliminate any detrimental effects on nestling growth and survival of experimentally increased nest temperature during the incubation period. We employed a split-brood design in which we increased nest temperature of entire clutches and, after hatching, provided dietary supplements of the antioxidant vitamin E to half of the nestlings within broods. We also recorded female incubation and provisioning behaviour to control for the possibility that heating nests might also influence maternal behaviour. There was a significant interaction between nestbox heating treatment and vitamin E treatment in their effect on nestling mass, a trait that is positively correlated with survival and future reproductive success in the study population. Vitamin E supplementation promoted increased nestling mass in heated nests, whereas it had the opposite effect in control nests, but these effects were weak. Heating significantly affected female incubation behaviour, with females in heated nestboxes investing less in incubation than those in unheated boxes. These results suggest that within at least some range of expected increased ambient temperatures during the 21st century, effects of climate change on nestling bird development can be mitigated by adjustments in female incubation behaviour."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of VE on growth performance and flesh quality in sub-adult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 450 fish (713.53 ± 1.50 g) were randomly divided into six treatment groups (three replicates per treatment) and fed for nine weeks with different experimental diets (dietary lipid 47.8 g/kg) that contained different levels of VE (5.44, 52.07, 96.85, 141.71, 185.66, and 230.12 mg/kg diet, supplemented as dl-α-tocopherol acetate). Notably, the treatment groups that were fed with dietary VE ranging from 52.07 to 230.12 mg/kg diet showed improvement in the percent weight gain, special growth rate, and feed efficiency of grass carp. Moreover, the treatment groups supplemented with dietary VE level of 141.71, 185.66, and 230.12 mg/kg diet showed enhancement in crude protein, lipid, and α-tocopherol contents in the muscle, and the dietary levels of VE ranging from 52.07 to 141.71 mg/kg diet improved muscle pH24h and shear force but reduced muscle cooking loss in grass carp. Furthermore, appropriate levels of VE (52.07 to 96.85 mg/kg diet) increased the muscle polyunsaturated fatty acid content in grass carp. Dietary VE also increased the mRNA levels of fatty acid synthesis-related genes, including fas, scd-1, fad, elovl, srebp1, pparγ, and lxrα, and up-regulated the expression of SREBP-1 protein. However, dietary VE decreased the expression of fatty acid decomposition-related genes, including hsl, cpt1, acox1, and pparα, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes, including perk, ire1, atf6, eif2α, atf4, xbp1, chop, and grp78, and down-regulated the expression of p-PERK, p-IRE1, ATF6, and GRP78 proteins. In conclusion, dietary VE increased muscle fatty acid synthesis, which may be partly associated with the alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ultimately improves fish flesh quality. Moreover, the VE requirements for sub-adult grass carp (713.53 to 1590.40 g) were estimated to be 124.9 and 122.73 mg/kg diet based on percentage weight gain and muscle shear force, respectively."
