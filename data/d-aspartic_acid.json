      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the impact of olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine as adjunctive treatments for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. And it is expected to add supporting points related to the rebalance of neurotransmitters in the brain through adjuvant therapy in the clinical management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who received standardized immunotherapy at Hunan Brain Hospital between January 2018 and December 2020. RESULTS: Compared to the olanzapine group, both the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups showed lower scores on the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS) total score after 3 weeks of treatment (all P < 0.05). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were significantly higher than in the olanzapine group after 3 weeks and 3 months of treatment (all P < 0.05). After 3 months of treatment, the proportions of patients with a modified Rankin scale score (mRS) of 0-1 in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were significantly higher than in the olanzapine group (all P < 0.05). The electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormality ranks at 3 months were significantly lower in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups compared with the olanzapine group (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, the Glx/Cr ratio significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (all P < 0.05) in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups, while the Glx/Cr ratio in the olanzapine group showed no significant change (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with olanzapine, the addition of magnesium valproate or lamotrigine to immunotherapy might be associated with a lower PANSS score, higher MoCA score, and lower mRS score. The improvement of neurological functions and cognitive function may be related to the decreased Glx/Cr ratio.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of middle-aged and elderly people, clinically characterized by resting tremor, myotonia, reduced movement, and impaired postural balance. Clinically, patients with PD are often administered levodopa (L-DOPA) to improve their symptoms. However, after years of L-DOPA treatment, most patients experience complications of varying severity, including the \"on-off phenomenon\", decreased efficacy, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). The development of LID can seriously affect the quality of life of patients, but its pathogenesis is unclear and effective treatments are lacking. Glutamic acid (Glu)-mediated changes in synaptic plasticity play a major role in LID. The N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR), an ionotropic glutamate receptor, is closely associated with synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation can modulate NMDAR activation or expression; in addition, neuroinflammation may be involved in the development of LID. However, it is not clear whether NMDA receptors are co-regulated with neuroinflammation during LID formation. Here we review how neuroinflammation mediates the development of LID through the regulation of NMDA receptors, and assess whether common anti-inflammatory drugs and NMDA receptor antagonists may be able to mitigate the development of LID through the regulation of central neuroinflammation, thereby providing a new theoretical basis for finding new therapeutic targets for LID.",

However, insights into the pharmacological modulation of NMDA receptors were mainly lack of subunit and synaptic selectivity. The purpose of the present study was to develop a novel strategy to rapidly recognize NMDA subunit 2A (NMDA-2A) ligands from natural products and provide subunit-selective drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The recombinant NMDA-2A containing a tag of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and immobilized on ibrutinib-modified microspheres based on the specific reaction between EGFR and its inhibitor ibrutinib. A novel affinity stationary phase was synthesized to screen NMDA-2A ligands from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis. RESULTS: The immobilized receptor column exhibited excellent receptor selectivity and ligand-binding activity. Crocetin was screened by using this method. In a cellular model of AD, the protein level of NMDA-2A was significantly decreased compared with the control group, while treatment with crocetin significantly increased NMDA-2A level in a concentration-dependent manner, confirming that crocetin could bind to NMDA-2A in vitro. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we developed a reliable method for the rapid identification of NMDA-2A ligands from natural products, which may be used as a platform for new drug discovery to generate high-quality drug candidates.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The number of patients with diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) continues to increase, but available treatments are limited. This study aimed to examine the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)-NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)- N -methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 2B (NR2B) pathway on type 2 DNP. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a high-fat and high-sugar diet for 8 weeks. Then, rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg) to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats. Diabetic rats with <85% of their basic levels in mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency were classified as DNP rats on day 14 after STZ injection. DNP rats were treated with ROS scavenger N-tert-Butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN, 100 mg·kg -1 ·d -1 ) or TXNIP small interfering ribonucleic acid (10 μg/d) once daily for 14 days. The level of ROS, protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-1 (caspase-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), NR2B phosphorylation at Tyr1472 (p-NR2B), total NR2B (t-NR2B), and distribution of NLRP3 in the spinal cord were examined. In vitro experiments, BV2 cells and PC12 cells were individually cultured and cocultured in a high-glucose environment (35 mmol/L D-glucose). The level of ROS and protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, caspase-1, and IL-1β in BV2 cells, and p-NR2B, t-NR2B in PC12 cells were detected. The level of ROS was detected by the flow cytometry approach. The protein levels were detected by the Western blot technique. The location of NLRP3 was observed by immunofluorescent staining. The interaction between TXNIP and NLRP3 was detected by coimmunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: The level of spinal ROS increased in DNP rats. The mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia of DNP rats were alleviated after systemic administration of PBN. This administration decreased protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, caspase-1, IL-1β, and p-NR2B and the coupling of TXNIP to NLRP3 in spinal cords of DNP rats. Furthermore, knockdown of spinal TXNIP alleviated nociceptive hypersensitivity and decreased protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, caspase-1, IL-1β, and p-NR2B in DNP rats. The level of ROS and protein levels of NLRP3, TXNIP, caspase-1, IL-1β, the coupling of TXNIP to NLRP3, and the IL-1β secretion increased in BV2 cells, and the protein expression of p-NR2B increased in cocultured PC12 cells in a high-glucose environment. All of these in vitro effects were significantly blocked after treatment of PBN. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that spinal ROS can contribute to type 2 DNP through TXNIP-NLRP3-NR2B pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is the main cause of dental implant failure, which is associated with pyroptosis. The roles of D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) on pyroptosis and the mechanism of the protective effect of D-Asp on human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of D-Asp on the pyroptosis of HGFs induced by high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of D-Asp on HGFs was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, the membrane permeability was investigated by propidium iodide/ Hoechst 33,342 double staining, flow cytometry analysis, and lactate dehydrogenase releasing, The gene and protein expression levels were detected by real-time quantitative PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Cell viability analysis showed that D-Asp ≤ 30 mM had no cytotoxicity to HGFs. HMGB1 drastically raised the membrane permeability of HGFs, while 1/10/30 mM D-Asp suppressed the permeability and remained the integrity of the membrane. HMGB1 promoted the mRNA expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1β, and IL-18, and the protein expression of IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1, GSDMD, and NLRP3. CONCLUSIONS: With the pretreatment of HGFs with D-Asp of 1/10/30 mM for 24 h, the cell membrane permeability was reduced and the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1β, and IL-18 was significantly decreased compared with the HMGB1 group, indicating the competitive antagonism of D-Asp against HMGB1 on the binding with toll-like receptors. Hence, this study may provide a novel insight into preventing pyroptosis and propose a new strategy for the treatment of peri-implantitis.",

      "abstract": "Intrauterine hypoxia is a common complication during pregnancy and could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in offspring. However, the underlying mechanism is controversial. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is reported to be a potential cardio-protective agent. We hypothesized that antenatal memantine treatment could prevent heart injury in neonatal offspring exposed to intrauterine hypoxia. Pregnant rats were exposed to gestational hypoxia or antenatal memantine treatment during late pregnancy. Newborns were then sacrificed to assess multiple parameters. The results revealed that Intrauterine hypoxia resulted in declining birth weight, heart weight, and an abnormally high heart weight/birth weight ratio. Furthermore, intrauterine hypoxia caused mitochondrial structural, functional abnormalities and decreased expression of DRP1, and upregulation of NMDAR1 in vivo. Antenatal memantine treatment,an NMDARs antagonist, improved these changes. In vitro, hypoxia increased the glutamate concentration and expression of NMDAR1. NMDAR activation may lead to similar changes in mitochondrial function, structure, and downregulation of DRP1 in vitro. Pharmacological blockade of NMDARs by the non-competitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 or knockdown of the glutamate receptor NR1 significantly attenuated the increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and calcium overload-induced by hypoxia exposure. These facts suggest that memantine could provide a novel and promising treatment for clinical use in intrauterine hypoxia during pregnancy to protect the cardiac mitochondrial function in the offspring. To our best knowledge, our research is the first study that shows intrauterine hypoxia can excessively activate cardiac NMDARs and thus cause mitochondrial dysfunction."

      "abstract": "Our previous studies demonstrated that effects of moxibustion heavily relied on heat-sensitization response, a specific sensation induced by moxibustion in the ill body. On the sensation, long-term potentiation (LTP) of prelimbic cortex was attributed to heat-sensitization responses. The N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor plays a key role in LTP induction; however, little is known about the role of NMDA receptor in heat-sensitization response. The present study investigated the role of NMDA receptor in heat-sensitization response, specifically, NMDA receptor was inhibited by competitive glutamatergic antagonist, (±)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), observing the frequency of heat-sensitization response in moxibustion treatment and evaluating the conducive outcomes to cerebral infarct rats for rehabilitation. Heat-sensitization response in cerebral infarct rats was regularly measured for all the samples when exposed to moxibustion. Intraperitoneal injection of CPP was conducted, and soon afterwards, a significant drop of heat-sensitization response in all the samples was measured. Moreover, moxibustion efficiency on rehabilitation was unfavourably affected in cerebral infarct rats when compared to vehicle injection control. This indicated that NMDA receptor antagonist made a negative impact on induction of heat-sensitization response and consequently affected cerebral infarct rats to rehabilitate under moxibustion treatment. It also suggested that activating NMDA receptor played a positive part in ischemic stroke rehabilitation, and regulating its activity could be a feasible way to increase heat-sensitization response, improving the effect of moxibustion."

In the present study, we investigated effects of acute administration of lenalidomide on clonic seizure threshold in mice induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and possible role of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) and nitric oxide (NO) pathway. METHODS: We have utilized a clonic model of seizure in NMRI mice induced by PTZ to evaluate the potential effect of lenalidomide on seizure threshold. Different doses of lenalidomide (5, 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) were administered 1 hour before PTZ. To evaluate probable role of NMDAR/NO signaling, the non-selective NO synthase inhibitor L-N G-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10 mg/kg, i.p.), neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 30 mg/kg, i.p.), selective inducible NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG; 100 mg/kg, i.p.), selective NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.), and selective NMDAR agonist D-serine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) were injected 15 minutes before lenalidomide. RESULTS: Lenalidomide at 10 and 20 mg/kg significantly elevated the PTZ-induced seizure thresholds. Interestingly, L-NAME (10 mg/kg, i.p), 7-NI (30 mg/kg, i.p), and AG (100 mg/kg, i.p) reversed the anticonvulsive effect of lenalidomide (10 mg/kg). Moreover, treatment with the NMDAR agonist D-serine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) did not alter the anticonvulsive properties of lenalidomide (10 mg/kg, i.p). However, the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (0.01 mg/kg, i.p) significantly reversed the anticonvulsive effects of lenalidomide (10 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a role for the NMDAR/NO pathway in the anticonvulsive effects of lenalidomide on the PTZ-induced clonic seizures in mice."

      "abstract": "Herein is reported the first evidence of the protective role of D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) in preventing the toxic effect exerted by the alkylating agent ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS) in the rat testis. We confirmed that EDS treatment specifically destroyed Leydig cells (LC), resulting in the drastic decrease of the serum testosterone level and producing morphological changes in the germinal tubules, i.e., altered organization of the epithelium, loss of cell contacts and the consequent presence of empty spaces between them, and a reduce number of spermatozoa. Moreover, an increase of TUNEL-positive germ cells, other than alteration in the protein level and localization of two LC \"markers\", StAR and PREP, were observed. Interestingly, results obtained from rats pre-treated with D-Asp for 15 days before EDS-injection showed that all the considered parameters were quite normal. To explore the probable mechanism(s) involved in the protection exerted by D-Asp, we considered the increased oxidative stress induced by EDS and the D-Asp antioxidant effects. Thiobarbiturc acid-reactive species (TBARS) levels increased following EDS-injection, while no change was observed in the D-Asp + EDS treated rats. Our results showed that D-Asp may be used as a strategy to mitigate the toxic effects exerted by environmental pollutants, as endocrine disrupters, in order to preserve the reproductive function."

Among the women without NMDA receptor encephalitis, the mean age was 33.3 ± 14.9 years, 84.0% were of reproductive age, 5.2% were premenarchal, and 10.8% were menopausal. The mean diameter of the dermoid cyst in this group was 77.3 ± 33.3-mm. The 2 patients diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis were 21 years old and 42 years old. The diameters of their dermoid cysts were 15-mm and 80-mm, respectively. The patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis were managed with laparoscopic resection, plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulins, and corticosteroids; 1 patient also received immunosuppressive treatment. Both recovered without significant neurologic sequela. CONCLUSION: Paraneoplastic syndrome due to NMDA receptor antibodies is a rare complication of dermoid cysts. This complication may occur in younger or older women, as well as in small- or large-diameter cysts. Thus, a high index of suspicion is required to correctly diagnose and treat women presenting with neurologic symptoms in the presence of dermoid cysts.",

We report a rare case of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 3 complicated by anti-NMDA-R encephalitis. After hospitalization for type 1 diabetes, the 39-year-old patient developed various schizophreniform symptoms and seizures after cold-like symptoms. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis. Immune-related encephalitis was suspected at the early phase of the disease, and cerebrospinal fluid was positive for anti-NMDA-R antibody. Early steroid pulse therapy was initiated during the disease course. The condition improved gradually to full recovery. Early detection and treatment of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis should enhance a positive outcome, considering that besides thyroid diseases and type 1 diabetes, various autoimmune diseases are associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 3.",

      "abstract": "Depression is immensely attributed to the overactivation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor in the brains. As regulatory binding partners of NMDA receptor, both Zn2+ and H+ are intimately interrelated to NMDA receptor's activity. Therefore, exploring synergistic changes on the levels of Zn2+ and H+ in brains will promote the knowledge and treatment of depression. However, the lack of efficient, appropriate imaging tools limits simultaneously tracking Zn2+ and H+ in living mouse brains. Thus, a well-designed dual-color fluorescent probe (DNP) was fabricated for the simultaneous monitoring of Zn2+ and H+ in the brains of mice with depression. Encountering Zn2+, the probe evoked bright blue fluorescence at 460 nm. Meanwhile, the red fluorescence at 680 nm was decreased with H+ addition. With blue/red dual fluorescence signal of DNP, we observed the synchronous increased Zn2+ and H+ in PC12 cells under oxidative stress. Notably, in vivo imaging for the first time revealed the simultaneous reduction of Zn2+ and pH in brains of mice with depression-like behaviors. Further results implied that the NMDA receptor might be responsible for the coinstantaneous fluctuation of Zn2+ and H+ during depression. Altogether, this work is conducive to the knowledge of neural signal transduction mechanisms, advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis in depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that low-intensity ultrasound (LIUS), a noninvasive mechanical stimulus, inhibits brain edema formation induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) or treatment with glutamate, a mediator of OGD-induced edema, in acute rat hippocampal slice model in vitro. METHODS: In this study, we treated the rat hippocampal slices with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) or (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) to determine whether these different glutamate receptor agonists induce edema. The hippocampal slices were then either sonicated with LIUS or treated with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, namely, MK-801 and ketamine, and observed their effects on edema formation. RESULTS: We observed that treatment with NMDA, an agonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors, induced brain edema at similar degrees compared with that induced by OGD. However, treatment with DHPG, an agonist of metabotropic glutamate receptors, did not significantly induce brain edema. Treatment with the NMDAR antagonists MK-801 or ketamine efficiently prevented brain edema formation by both OGD and NMDA in a concentration-dependent manner. N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced brain edema was alleviated by LIUS in an intensity-dependent manner when ultrasound was administered at 30, 50, or 100 mW/cm2 for 20 minutes before the induction of the edema. Furthermore, LIUS reduced OGD- and NMDA-induced phosphorylation of NMDARs at Y1325. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LIUS can inhibit OGD- or NMDA-induced NMDAR activation by preventing NMDAR phosphorylation, thereby reducing a subsequent brain edema formation. The mechanisms by which LIUS inhibits NMDAR phosphorylation need further investigation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Sodium salicylate (SS) is well known for its ototoxic properties that induce functional and morphological changes in the cochlea and brain. Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has been widely used for treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases; however, its effects on salicylate-induced ototoxicity remain unclear. Herein, we examined the effects of EGb 761 (EGb), a standard form of GBE, on the plasticity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (GluN2B) in the inferior colliculus (IC) following SS administration. METHODS: Seven-week-old Sprague Dawley rats (n=24) were randomly allocated to control, SS, EGb, and EGb+SS groups. The SS group received a single intraperitoneal SS injection (350 mg/kg), the EGb group received EGb orally for 5 consecutive days (40 mg/kg), and the EGb+SS group received EGb for 5 consecutive days, followed by an SS injection. The auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were assessed at baseline and 2 hours after SS administration. GluN2B expression was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in ABR threshold shifts among the groups. The expression of the GluN2B protein normalized by which of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was significantly lower in the EGb+SS group, as compared to the SS group (P=0.012). Weak and diffused GluN2B immunoreactivity was detected in the IC neural cells of the EGb+SS group, while those of the SS group exhibited strong and diffused GluN2B positivity. CONCLUSION: EGb may play a role in regulating the GluN2B expression in the IC of salicylate-induced ototoxicity model."

Here, we investigated the short-term effects of DAA on serum biomarkers of the HPG-axis in male climbers. Using a single-blinded, placebo-controlled design, 16 climbers were randomly assigned to either a DAA (3 g/day) or placebo (3 g/day) supplement for 2 weeks. The reverse treatment commenced after a 2-week washout, with all conditions administered in a balanced manner. The subjects maintained their normal weekly training across this study. Serum samples taken before and after each treatment were analyzed for T, luteinizing hormone, sex hormone binding globulin, and cortisol (C), and free T was calculated (cFT). The DAA supplement did not significantly affect serum T, cFT, and luteinizing hormone levels. Only a main effect of time on sex hormone binding globulin (6.8% increase) and C (13.6% decrease) emerged (p < .03). Significant negative associations were identified between pretest values and changes (%) in T, cFT, luteinizing hormone, and C levels with DAA and/or placebo, but these relationships did not differ between treatments (p > .46). Additional measures of physical function and serum hematology also failed to respond to DAA. In summary, a daily dose of DAA during a short training period did not influence T and selected indicators of the HPG-axis in male climbers. Other parameters linked to athletic performance and health status were also unaffected. Our findings support evidence showing that DAA (including DAA-blended supplements) at either recommended or higher dosages does not afford any ergogenic benefits for athletic males.",

A 58-year-old woman presented with altered mental status and an 8-month history of weight loss, apathy and somnolence. Laboratory evaluation confirmed Graves' disease with thyrotoxicosis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Despite treatment, she continued to have a fluctuating mental status. Further diagnostic evaluation included an abdominal MRI that showed a cystic lobular left adnexal mass. Serum anti-NMDA-R antibodies were positive, raising concern for NMDA-R encephalitis. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, with pathology consistent with cystadenofibroma. She had a favourable recovery with marked clinical improvement. Anti-NMDA-R antibodies were negative 2 months following surgery. The concomitant occurrence of APS and anti-NMDA-R encephalitis suggests a shared mechanism of autoimmune pathophysiology.",

The cytotoxicity and serum stability of WSLP loaded with siRNA were evaluated, and the knockdown efficiency of WSLP/NR2B-siRNA in PC12 cells was examined. The results showed that WSLP could protect the loading siRNAs from enzymatic degradation in serum and exhibit low cytotoxicity to cells. After transfection, WSLP/NR2B-siRNA complexes reduced the NR2B transcriptional level by 50% and protein level by 55% compared to control siRNA. Moreover, 3 days after intrathecal injection of WSLP/NR2B-siRNA complexes into rats, the NR2B protein expression decreased significantly to 58%, compared to control treatment (p < 0.01). Injection of WSLP with scrambled siRNA or of polyethylenimine (PEI) with NR2B-siRNA did not show this inhibitory effect. Additionally, injection of WSLP/NR2B-siRNA complexes significantly relieved inflammatory pain in rats at 3, 4, and 5 days with reduced MWT and decreased TWL scores, while injection of WSLP with scrambled siRNA or of PEI with NR2B-siRNA did not. These results demonstrated that WSLP can efficiently deliver siRNA targeting NR2B to PC12 cells and relieve pain in rats with chronic inflammatory pain.",

      "abstract": "It has been identified that chronic ethanol exposure damages the nervous system, particularly neurons. There is scientific evidence suggesting that neuronal loss caused by chronic ethanol exposure has an association with neuron apoptosis and intracellular calcium oscillation is one of the primary inducers of apoptosis. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the inductive effects of intracellular calcium oscillation on apoptosis in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells and the protective effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, memantine, on SK-N-SH cell apoptosis caused by chronic ethanol exposure. SK-N-SH cells were treated with 100 mM ethanol and memantine (4 µM) for 2 days. Protein expression of NR1 was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi). Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double-staining and flow cytometry and cell viability was detected using an MTS kit. Fluorescence dual wavelength spectrophotometry was used to determine the intracellular calcium concentration and the levels of NR1 and caspase-3 were detected using western blotting. NR1 mRNA levels were also detected using qPCR. It was found that chronic ethanol exposure reduced neuronal cell viability and caused apoptosis of SK-N-SH cells, and the extent of damage in SK-N-SH cells was associated with ethanol exposure concentration and time. In addition, chronic ethanol exposure increased the concentration of intracellular calcium in SK-N-SH cells by inducing the expression of NMDAR, resulting in apoptosis, and memantine treatment reduced ethanol-induced cell apoptosis. The results of the present study indicate that the application of memantine may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of alcoholic dementia."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Research on d-aspartic acid (DAA) has demonstrated increases in total testosterone levels in untrained men, however research in resistance-trained men demonstrated no changes, and reductions in testosterone levels. The long-term consequences of DAA in a resistance trained population are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of DAA to alter basal testosterone levels over 3 months of resistance training in resistance-trained men. DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in healthy resistance-trained men, aged 18-36, had been performing regular resistance training exercise for at least 3 d.w-1 for the previous 2 years. Randomised participants were 22 men (d-aspartic acid n = 11; placebo n = 11) (age, 23.8±4.9 y, training age, 3.2±1.5 y). INTERVENTION: D-aspartic acid (6 g.d-1, DAA) versus equal-weight, visually-matched placebo (PLA). All participants performed 12 weeks of supervised, periodised resistance training (4 d.w-1), with a program focusing on all muscle groups. MEASURES: Basal hormones, total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), estradiol (E2), sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin (ALB); isometric strength; calf muscle cross-sectional area (CSA); calf muscle thickness; quadriceps muscle CSA; quadriceps muscle thickness; evoked V-wave and H-reflexes, were assessed at weeks zero (T1), after six weeks (T2) and after 12 weeks (T3). RESULTS: No change in basal TT or FT were observed after the intervention. DAA supplementation (n = 10) led to a 16%, 95% CI [-27%, -5%] reduction in E2 from T1-T3 (p<0.01). The placebo group (n = 9) demonstrated improvements in spinal responsiveness (gastrocnemius) at the level of the alpha motoneuron. Both groups exhibited increases in isometric strength of the plantar flexors by 17%, 95% CI [7%, 28%] (p<0.05) as well as similar increases in hypertrophy in the quadriceps and calf muscles. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this paper indicate that DAA supplementation is ineffective at changing testosterone levels, or positively affecting training outcomes. Reductions in estradiol and the blunting of peripheral excitability appear unrelated to improvements from resistance training.

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms and other neuropsychiatric dysfunctions are common in neurodegenerative disorders, including chronic pain and dementia. A correlation between the β-amyloid protein accumulation and the development of depression has been suggested, however the underlying mechanisms are unknown. d-Aspartate (d-Asp) is a free d-amino acid found in the mammalian brain and involved in neurological and psychiatric processes, such as cognition and affective disorders. In this study we have investigated the effects of a repeated treatment with d-Asp in a long-lasting (12 months) model of neuropathic pain, the spared nerve injury (SNI), in mice. Specifically, we evaluated i) the pain sensitivity and related emotional/cognitive dysfunctions induced by SNI, ii) possible changes in the β-amyloid protein accumulation in specific brain regions involved in pain mechanisms ii) possible changes in steroids level in neuropathic animals with or without d-Asp in the same brain areas. SNI mice showed an increase of the insoluble form of Aβ1-42 at hippocampal level and displayed cognitive impairments, stereotypical and depressive-like behaviours. d-Asp treatment reduced abnormal behaviours and normalized the β-amyloid protein expression. Moreover, d-Asp dramatically increased steroids level measured in the prefrontal cortex and in the hippocampus. Our findings provide new insights into pain mechanisms and suggest a possible role of β-amyloid protein in neuropsychiatric dysfunctions associated with chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor) encephalitis, first described in 2007, is a rare, autoimmune limbic encephalitis. In half of the cases anti-NMDAR antibodies are paraneoplastic manifestations of an underlying tumor (mostly ovarian teratoma). In the early stage of the disease psychiatric symptoms are prominent, therefore 60-70% of the patients are first treated in a psychiatric department. In most of the cases, typical neurological symptoms appear later. Besides the clinical picture and typical symptoms, verifying presence of IgG antibodies in the serum or CSF is necessary to set up the diagnosis. Other diagnostic tools, including laboratory tests, MRI, lumbar puncture or EEG are neither specific, nor sensitive enough. Therapy is based on supportive care, plasma exchange and immune suppression, intensive care administration can be necessary. If there is an underlying tumor, tumor removal is the first-line treatment. The disease can cause fatal complications in the acute phase but with adequate therapy long-term prognosis is good, although rehabilitation can last for months. In the past few years besides the typical clinical picture and illness course an increasing number of case reports described no typical neurological symptoms, only psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, disorganized behavior, and catatonic symptoms. Immune suppressive treatment was still effective in most of these cases. Such cases present a difficult diagnostic challenge. These patients may receive unnecessary antipsychotic treatment because of the suspected schizophrenia, although they often suffer from serious extrapyramidal side effects. A few years ago there was a hypothesis that a small part of the patients who are treated with therapy-resistant schizophrenia may suffer from anti-NMDAR encephalitis, so they require a different kind of medication. Evidence from the latest publications did not confirm this hypothesis, although the connection between anti-NMDAR antibodies and disorders with psychotic symptoms is still not clear. After reviewing the most important studies regarding the psychiatric aspects of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, we present a case report of a patient with a pure psychiatric manifestation of this disease. We conclude with a short outline of the design and plan of our future study.",

Twenty 55-week-old roosters were selected and equally split into four groups (n = 5 rooster/group). Different daily D-Asp doses including 0 (D-0), 100 (D-100), 200 (D-200) or 300 (D-300) mg/kg BW were capsulated and individually administered for 12 weeks to roosters in each group. Semen samples were weekly collected from 7th to 12th week of experiment. Sperm quality from 7th to 11th week was evaluated in both fresh (total and forward motility and plasma membrane functionality) and post-thawed (total and forward motility, plasma membrane functionality, apoptosis status and mitochondrial activity) conditions. Also, collected semen samples on the 12th week were frozen and artificially inseminated to evaluate fertility and hatchability. The results from fresh condition showed that total and forward motility and plasma membrane functionality were significantly higher in D-200 compared to other groups. Also, interaction effect of time and treatment was not significant for all assessed parameters in fresh condition. In post-thawed condition, D-200 showed significantly higher total and forward motility, fertility and hatchability compared to other groups. The higher value for plasma membrane functionality and mitochondrial activity was observed in D-200 compared to D-0 and D300 groups. However, the percentage of live, early apoptotic and dead spermatozoa were not significantly affected by applied treatment in the current study. No significant difference for time and treat interaction effect was observed for all assessed parameters except forward motility. In conclusion, it seems that D-Asp administration could improve fresh and post-thawed sperm quality and post-thawed sperm fertility in male broiler breeders.",

      "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteine has become a critical risk for atherosclerosis and can stimulate proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) is a receptor of homocysteine and mediates the effects of homocysteine on VSMCs. Bioinformatics analysis has shown NMDAR is a potential target of microRNA-217 (miR-217), which exerts multiple functions in cancer tumorigenesis and carotid plaque progression. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of miR-217 in VSMCs phenotype transition under homocysteine exposure and elucidate its effect on atherosclerotic plaque formation. After treating with several doses of homocysteine (0-8 × 10(-4)  mol/L) for 24 hours, the expression of miR-217 in HA-VSMCs and rat aortic VSMCs was not altered. Intriguingly, the expression of NMDAR mRNA and protein was reduced by homocysteine in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of miR-217 mimic significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of VSMCs with homocysteine treatment, while transfection of miR-217 inhibitor promoted VSMCs migration. Moreover, miR-217 mimic down-regulated while miR-217 inhibitor up-regulated NMDAR protein expression but not NMDAR mRNA expression. Through luciferase reporter assay, we showed that miR-217 could directly bind to the 3'-UTR of NMDAR. MiR-217 mimic transfection also released the inhibition of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-PGC-1α signalling induced by homocysteine. Additionally, restoration of PGC-1α expression via AdPGC-1α infection markedly suppressed VSMCs proliferation through the degradation of NADPH oxidase (NOX1) and reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, our study identified the role of miR-217 in regulating VSMCs proliferation and migration, which might serve as a target for atherosclerosis therapy.",

However, the mechanisms of inflammatory injury following ICH are still unclear, particularly the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome, which are crucial to sterile inflammatory responses. In this study, we aim to test the hypothesis that NLRP3 signaling pathway takes a vital position in ICH-induced secondary inflammatory damage and detect the role of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 1 (NMDAR1) in this progress. METHODS: ICH was induced in mice by microinjection of hemin into the striatum. The protein levels of NMDAR1, NMDAR1 phosphorylation, NLRP3 and IL-1b were measured by Western blot. The binding of NMDAR1 to NLRP3 was detected by immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: The expression of NMDAR1, NMDAR1 phosphorylation, NLRP3 and IL-1b were rapidly increased after ICH. Hemin treatment enhanced NMDAR1 expression and NMDAR1 phosphorylation, as well in cultured microglial cells treated by hemin. Hemin up regulated NLRP3 and IL-1b level, which was reversed by MK801 (NMDAR antagonist) in vitro. Hemin also promoted the binding of NMDAR1 to NLRP3. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that NMDAR1 plays a pivotal role in hemin-induced NLRP3-mediated inflammatory damage through synergistic activation.",

We designed and synthesized a novel series of Pin1 inhibitors based on a glutamic acid or aspartic acid scaffold bearing an aromatic moiety to provide a hydrophobic surface and a cyclic aliphatic amine moiety with affinity for the proline-binding site of Pin1. Glutamic acid derivatives bearing cycloalkylamino and phenylthiazole groups showed potent Pin1-inhibitory activity comparable with that of known inhibitor VER-1.

      "abstract": "Ketamine abusers have greatly increased in number worldwide during recent years. The consumption of ketamine has increased, as have the number of published accounts of devastating urological sequelae. However, the mechanism of ketamine-associated urinary tract dysfunction remains unclear. This study was to evaluate the ketamine dose-dependency of ketamine-induced cystitis (KC) in a rat model. A total of 42 Sprague-Dawley rats (female, 10-week-old) were used. Each of the 7 KC rat models were induced by 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg ketamine intravenous injection for two weeks. For the sham group (n = 7), a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle was used rather than ketamine hydrochloride. The cystometric parameters, histological examinations, staining for Masson's trichome, cytokeratin, toluidine blue and quantitative PCR were measured at two weeks following the intervention. The voiding interval gradually decreased depending upon the ketamine dose of 1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg, respectively, and was decreased compared with Sham. Bladder capacity was decreased as ketamine dose increased. In particular, the increase of fibrosis and submucosal apoptosis were found according to the increase of the ketamine dose. The bladder apoptosis in the KC rat model makes the fibrotic bladder change, and led us to hypothesize that fibrosis could contribute to the lower urinary-tract symptoms. We suggest that according to the pathophysiology evidence, fibrosis induced by apoptosis plays a key role in KC.",

      "abstract": "Neural injury is associated with the development of diabetic retinopathy. Müller cells provide structural and metabolic support for retinal neurons. High glucose concentrations are known to induce Müller cell activity. Agmatine is an endogenous polyamine, which is enzymatically formed in the mammalian brain and has exhibited neuroprotective effects in a number of experimental models. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether agmatine protects Müller cells from glucose-induced damage and to explore the mechanisms underlying this process. Lactate dehydrogenase activity and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA expression were significantly reduced in Müller cells exposed to a high glucose concentration, following agmatine treatment, compared with cells not treated with agmatine. In addition, agmatine treatment inhibited glucose-induced Müller cell apoptosis, which was associated with the regulation of Bax and Bcl-2 expression. Agmatine treatment suppressed glucose-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein in Müller cells. The present study demonstrated that the protective effects of agmatine on Müller cells were inhibited by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). The results of the present study suggested that agmatine treatment protects Müller cells from high-concentration glucose-induced cell damage. The underlying mechanisms may relate to the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of agmatine, as well as to the inhibition of the MAPK pathway, via NMDA receptor suppression. Agmatine may be of use in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for patients with diabetic retinopathy.",

However, research has shown that the induction and maintenance of central sensitization is dependent on N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) activation. Chronic morphine exposure has been shown to result in spinal sensitization and activation of spinal NMDARs. Chronic morphine treatment and the activation of spinal NMDARs may be synergistic and form a closed loop that may worsen the development of morphine analgesic tolerance and spinal sensitization. Inhibition of NMDARs with an antagonist could effectively alleviate the development of morphine analgesic tolerance. So, what is the effect of modulating spinal NMDAR activation with exogenous agonists or neuropathic input on the development of morphine-induced analgesic tolerance? Our hypothesis is that chronic morphine treatment may worsen the already activation of spinal NMDARs and spinal sensitization after agonist application or neuropathic input to shorten the process of morphine-induced analgesic tolerance.",

The metabolism and disposition of lanicemine was determined in six healthy male subjects after a single intravenous infusion dose of 150 mg [(14)C]-lanicemine. 2.Blood, urine and feces were collected from all subjects. The ratios of Cmax and AUC(0-∞) of lanicemine to plasma total radioactivity were 84 and 66%, respectively, indicating that lanicemine was the major circulating component with T1/2 at 16 h. The plasma clearance of lanicemine was 8.3 L/h, revealing that lanicemine is a low-clearance compound. The mean recovery of radioactivity from urine was 93.8% of radioactive dose. 3.In urine samples, 10 metabolites of lanicemine were identified. Among which, an O-glucuronide conjugate (M1) was the most abundant metabolite (∼11% of the dose in excreta). In plasma, the circulatory metabolites were identified as a para-hydroxylated metabolite (M1), an O-glucuronide (M2), an N-carbamoyl glucuronide (M3) and an N-acetylated metabolite (M6). The average amount of each of metabolite was less than 4% of total radioactivity detected in plasma or urine. 4.In conclusion, lanicemine is a low-clearance compound.

      "abstract": "Statins are potent cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors that exert protective effects in humans and in experimental models of stroke. The mechanisms involved in these protective actions are not completely understood. This study evaluates whether atorvastatin (ATV) treatment affects the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor in the somatosensory cerebral cortex at short and long periods following ischemia. Sham and ischemic male Wistar rats received 10 mg/kg of ATV or placebo by gavage every 24 hr for 3 consecutive days. The first dose was administered 6 hr after ischemia-reperfusion or the sham operation. ATV treatment resulted in faster recovery of neurological scores than placebo, prevented the appearance of pyknotic neurons, and restored microtubule-associated protein 2 and neuronal nuclei staining to control values in the somatosensory cerebral cortex and the hippocampus at 72 hr and 15 days postischemia. Furthermore, ATV prevented spatial learning and memory deficits caused by cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia reduced the number of GluN1/PSD-95 and GluN2B/PSD-95 colocalization clusters in cortical pyramidal neurons and reduced the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cerebral cortex. These effects of the ischemic insult were prevented by ATV, which also induced GluN2B/PSD-95 colocalization in neuronal processes and an association of GluN2B with TrkB. The GluN2B pharmacological inhibitor ifenprodil prevented the increase in BDNF levels and the motor and cognitive function recovery caused by ATV in ischemic rats. These findings indicate that GluN2B is involved in the neuroprotective mechanism elicited by ATV to promote motor and cognitive recovery after focal cerebral ischemia.",

      "abstract": "Capsaicin, a transient receptor potential vanilloid type1 (TRPV1) agonist, has been reported to protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury in various organs, including the brain, heart, and kidney, whereas activation of TRPV1 was also reported to contribute to neurodegeneration, including pressure-induced retinal ganglion cell death in vitro. We histologically investigated the effects of capsaicin and SA13353, TRPV1 agonists, on retinal injury induced by intravitreal N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA; 200 nmol/eye) in rats in vivo. Under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to intravitreal NMDA injection. Capsaicin (5.0 nmol/eye) was intravitreally admianeously with NMDA injection. SA13353 (10mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered 15 min before NMDA injection. Morphometric evaluation at 7 days after NMDA injection showed that intravitreal NMDA injection resulted in ganglion cell loss. Capsaicin and SA13353 almost completely prevented this damage. Treatment with capsazepine (TRPV1 antagonist, 0.5 nmol/eye), CGRP (8-37) (calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, 0.5 pmol/eye), or RP67580 (tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, 0.5 nmol/eye) almost completely negated the protective effect of capsaicin in the NMDA-injected rats. Seven days after intravitreal NMDA injection, the cell number of retinal ganglion cell was significantly smaller than in the eye that had received capsaicin in B6.Cg-TgN(Thy1-CFP)23Jrs/J transgenic mice that express the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein in retinal ganglion cells in the retina. These results suggested that activation of TRPV1 protects retinal neurons from the injury induced by intravitreal NMDA in rats in vivo. Activation of CGRP and tachykinin NK1 receptors is possibly involved in underlying protective mechanisms.",

After incubation with 6-OHDA, simvastatin, and/or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 1 (NMDAR1) siRNA for 24 hr, test kits were used to detect the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutamate released from PC12 cells exposed to different culture media. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were determined by RT-PCR, and the protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. NMDAR1 were also determined by RT-PCR and the protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. LDH and glutamate levels in 6-OHDA-incubated PC12 cells increased compared with those in the controls, and incubation with simvastatin inhibited this elevation. Silencing of NMDAR1 with siRNA inhibited the expression of LDH and glutamate to a degree similar to simvastatin. The expression levels of NMDAR1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly upregulated after treatment with 6-OHDA. The 6-OHDA-stimulated mRNA and protein levels of the proinflammatory cytokines NMDAR1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were reduced by simvastatin. Silencing of NMDAR1 with siRNA decreased the NMDAR1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA and protein expression levels in 6-OHDA-stimulated PC12 cells. Simvastatin could also inhibit the expression of NMDAR1 and cytokines to a degree similar to silencing of NMDAR1 with siRNA. Our results suggest that NMDAR1 modulation could explain the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of simvastatin in experimental parkinsonian cell models.",

METHODS: Sixty male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation (sham) group, CCI model group and EA group (n = 20). CCI model was established by ligature of the right sciatic nerve with a piece of surgical chromic suture. For rats of the sham group, the right sciatic nerve was just isolated without ligature. The rats of the EA group were given with EA stimulation of \"Weizhong\" (BL 40) and \"Huantiao\" (GB 30) on the injured side at a frequency of 2 Hz, electric current of 1-3 mA for 30 min (increasing 1 mA every 10 min). The treatment was conducted once a day from the 11th day to the 20th day after modeling. NMDA receptor 2 B subunit (NR 2 B) protein and mRNA expression levels in the spinal cord were determined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively, and spinal NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR 1) protein and mRNA expression levels were measured by Western blot and RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: In comparison with the sham group, NR 1 protein and mRNA expression levels of the model group in the spinal cord were considerably upregulated after CCI (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). In comparison with the model group NR 1 protein and mRNA expression levels of the EA group in the spinal cord were evidently down-regulated (P < 0.05). No significant changes of NR 2 B protein and mRNA expression after CCI and EA stimulation were found after immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR measurements (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: EA intervention is effective in alleviating neuropathic pain in CCI rats, which may be closely related to its effects in lowering functional activity of NR 1 protein and mRNA in the spinal cord.",

      "abstract": "Excessive activation of glutamate receptors and overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the spinal dorsal horn, are key mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which endogenous IL-1β alters glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the spinal dorsal horn in rats with neuropathic pain induced by ligation of the L5 spinal nerve. We demonstrated that endogenous IL-1β in neuropathic rats enhances glutamate release from the primary afferent terminals and non-NMDA glutamate receptor activities in postsynaptic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) is a mediator used by IL-1β to enhance non-NMDA glutamate receptor activities in postsynaptic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Presynaptic NMDA receptors are effector receptors used by the endogenous IL-1β to enhance glutamate release from the primary afferents in neuropathic rats. This is further supported by the fact that NMDA currents recorded from small neurons in the dorsal root ganglion of normal rats are potentiated by exogenous IL-1β. Furthermore, we provided evidence that functional coupling between IL-1β receptors and presynaptic NMDA receptors at the primary afferent terminals is mediated by the neutral sphingomyelinase/ceramide signaling pathway. Hence, functional coupling between IL-1β receptors and presynaptic NMDA receptors at the primary afferent terminals is a crucial mechanism leading to enhanced glutamate release and activation of non-NMDA receptors in the spinal dorsal horn neurons in neuropathic pain conditions. Interruption of such functional coupling could be an effective approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain.",

      "abstract": "Neurosteroids are endogenous allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors (GABARs), and they enhance GABAR-mediated inhibition. However, GABARs expressed on hippocampal dentate granule neurons of epileptic animals are modified such that their neurosteroid sensitivity is reduced and δ subunit expression is diminished. We explored the molecular mechanisms triggering this GABAR plasticity. In the cultured hippocampal neurons, treatment with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) (10 μM) for 48 hours reduced the surface expression of δ and α4 subunits but did not increase the expression of γ2 subunits. The tonic current recorded from neurons in NMDA-treated cultures was reduced, and its neurosteroid modulation was also diminished. In contrast, synaptic inhibition and its modulation by neurosteroids were preserved in these neurons. The time course of NMDA's effects on surface and total δ subunit expression was distinct; shorter (6 hours) treatment decreased surface expression, whereas longer treatment reduced both surface and total expression. Dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) blocked NMDA's effects on δ subunit expression. Chelation of calcium ions by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) or blockade of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation by UO126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio] butadiene) also prevented the effects of NMDA. Thus, prolonged activation of NMDA receptors in hippocampal neurons reduced GABAR δ subunit expression through Ca(2+) entry and at least in part by ERK1/2 activation.",

Results showed that, compared with N-methyl-Daspartic acid-induced injury neurons, the activity of cells markedly increased, apoptosis was significantly reduced, leakage of lactate dehydrogenase decreased, and intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in neurons reduced after KN-93 treatment. The expression of caspase-3, phosphorylated calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and total calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II protein decreased after KN-93 treatment.

Recovery is mostly good but little is known about the disease course in patients whose treatment has been delayed severely. We present a 16-year-old girl with a 36-month follow-up. A single course of methylprednisolone attenuated some symptoms but severe and incapacitating frontotemporal syndrome remained. Second-line treatment with rituximab was initiated 12months after the onset of symptoms. A surprising recovery occurred 18months after treatment and 30months after onset. Recovery in NMDA receptor antibody-associated encephalitis can be severely delayed and does not have to be linear. Whether delayed therapy contributed to recovery in this patient cannot be answered with certainty. Spontaneous recovery independent of therapy is possible, as it has been observed previously as late as 3years after onset. Although serum antibodies disappeared with recovery in this patient, previous cases have shown serum antibodies to be unreliable markers of disease activity. Second-line treatment, especially with substances as well tolerated as rituximab, should at least be considered in NMDA receptor encephalitis with persistent neuropsychiatric syndromes after first-line therapy.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) express the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4) and are mainly responsible for non-image-forming visual tasks such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. Compared to other classes of RGCs, ipRGCs are more resistant to cell death in several experimental models such as ocular hypertension, optic nerve transection, and others. Here, we tested whether ipRGCs are also resistant to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. METHODS: Mice were injected intravitreally with NMDA, and subsequent expression levels of Opn4 and Brn3a mRNA were analyzed with semiquantitative real-time PCR. Cells immunopositive for BRN3A and OPN4 were quantified in retinal flat mounts of NMDA- and PBS-injected eyes. The molecular response of the retina to NMDA treatment was analyzed with real-time PCR and western blotting. Intravitreal injections of wortmannin and AG-490 were used to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling, respectively. RESULTS: In contrast to retinal Brn3a expression and BRN3A-containing cells, levels of Opn4 mRNA and the number of OPN4-expressing cells were not reduced after NMDA injection. Survival of ipRGCs after NMDA injection was not strain specific, did not require the presence of photoreceptor cells, and did not depend on PI3K/AKT or JAK/STAT signaling, although both signaling pathways were activated after NMDA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the existence of an efficient survival system for ipRGCs. This system does not depend on PI3K/AKT or JAK/STAT signaling. Identification of the responsible molecular survival mechanisms may provide clues to protect \"traditional\" ganglion cells in diseases such as glaucoma.",

      "abstract": "Ginseng has been shown to have memory-improving effects in human. However, little is known about the active components and the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects. Recently, we isolated novel lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs)-ginseng protein complex derived from ginseng, gintonin. Gintonin activates G protein-coupled LPA receptors with high affinity. Gintonin activated Ca²⁺-activated Clchannels in Xenopus oocytes through the activation of endogenous LPA receptor. In the present study, we investigated whether the activation of LPA receptor by gintonin is coupled to the regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor channel activity in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat NMDA receptors. The NMDA receptor-mediated ion current (I ( NMDA )) was measured using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. In oocytes injected with cRNAs encoding NMDA receptor subunits, gintonin enhanced I ( NMDA ) in a concentration-dependent manner. Gintonin-mediated I ( NMDA ) enhancement was blocked by Ki16425, an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist. Gintonin action was blocked by a PLC inhibitor, IP₃ receptor antagonist, Ca²⁺ chelator, and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The site-directed mutation of Ser1308 of the NMDA receptor, which is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC), to an Ala residue, or co-expression of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase with the NMDA receptor attenuated gintonin action. Moreover, gintonin treatment elicited a transient elevation of [Ca²⁺](i) in cultured hippocampal neurons and elevated longterm potentiation (LTP) in both concentration-dependent manners in rat hippocampal slices. Gintonin-mediated LTP induction was abolished by Ki16425. These results indicate that gintonin-mediated I ( NMDA ) potentiation and LTP induction in the hippocampus via the activation of LPA receptor might be responsible for ginseng-mediated improvement of memory-related brain functions.",

Here we report, for the first time, that there is a direct correlation among brain levels of D-Asp, P450 aro, E2 and Estradiol Receptor (ERα) in the male frogs during the reproductive as well as the post-reproductive phases of the breeding cycle, with highest levels being observed in the post-reproductive period. D-Asp i.p. administration to frogs ready for reproduction, induced an increase of brain P450 aro protein expression with concomitant enhancement of both E2 levels and ERα expression; at the same time, brain T levels and Androgen receptor expression decreased. In contrast, in the post-reproductive frogs, D-Asp treatment did not modify any of these parameters. Taken together, these results imply that the regulation of P450 aro expression by D-Asp could be an important step in the control of E2 levels in the frog brain.",

      "abstract": "Infantile spasms is an age-specific epileptic syndrome associated with poor developmental outcomes and poor response to nearly all traditional antiepileptic drugs except adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). We investigated the protective mechanism of ACTH against brain damage. An infantile spasm rat model induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in neonate rats was used. Pregnant rats were randomly divided into the stress-exposed and the non-stress exposed groups, and their offspring were randomly divided into ACTH-treated spasm model, untreated spasm model, and control groups. A proteomics-based approach was used to detect the proteome differences between ACTH-treated and untreated groups. Gel image analysis was followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric protein identification and bioinformatics analysis. Prenatal stress exposure resulted in more severe seizures, and ACTH treatment reduced and delayed the onset of seizures. The most significantly up-regulated proteins included isoform 1 of tubulin β-5 chain, cofilin-1 (CFL1), synaptosomal-associated protein 25, malate dehydrogenase, N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1, annexin A3 (ANXA3), and rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 (ARHGDIA). In contrast, tubulin α-1A chain was down-regulated. Three of the identified proteins, ARHGDIA, ANXA3, and CFL1, were validated using western blot analysis. ARHGDIA expression was assayed in the brain samples of five infantile spasm patients. These proteins are involved in the cytoskeleton, synapses, energy metabolism, vascular regulation, signal transduction, and acetylation. The mechanism underlying the effects of ACTH involves the molecular events affected by these proteins, and protein acetylation is the mechanism of action of the drug treatment.",

      "abstract": "Opioids are the most effective analgesics for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. However, chronic opioid treatment can cause both hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance, which limit their clinical efficacy. In this study, we determined the role of pre- and postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in controlling increased glutamatergic input in the spinal cord induced by chronic systemic morphine administration. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were performed on dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. Chronic morphine significantly increased the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs evoked from the dorsal root and the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs, and these changes were largely attenuated by blocking NMDARs and by inhibiting PKC, but not PKA. Also, blocking NR2A- or NR2B-containing NMDARs significantly reduced the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs and the amplitude of evoked EPSCs in morphine-treated rats. Strikingly, morphine treatment largely decreased the amplitude of evoked NMDAR-EPSCs and NMDAR currents of dorsal horn neurons elicited by puff NMDA application. The reduction in postsynaptic NMDAR currents caused by morphine was prevented by resiniferatoxin pretreatment to ablate TRPV1-expressing primary afferents. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of the NMDAR antagonist significantly attenuated the development of analgesic tolerance and the reduction in nociceptive thresholds induced by chronic morphine. Collectively, our findings indicate that chronic opioid treatment potentiates presynaptic, but impairs postsynaptic, NMDAR activity in the spinal cord. PKC-mediated increases in NMDAR activity at nociceptive primary afferent terminals in the spinal cord contribute critically to the development of opioid hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance.",

      "abstract": "The neuroendocrine impact on rheumatoid arthritis is not yet fully described although numerous neurotransmitters are shown to act as inflammatory modulators. One of these is the excitatory transmitter glutamate (Glu). In this study, the influence of the Glu receptor (GluR)-mediated effects on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was investigated. CIA was induced in DBA/1 mice by immunization with chicken collagen type II (CII). Mice were exposed to the following GluR antagonists: group 1, the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor channel blocker memantine; group 2, the metabotropic GluR antagonist AIDA, and group 3, the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KA). Arthritis was evaluated clinically and histologically and compared to PBS-treated controls. The effects of treatment on T cell populations and the levels of anti-CII and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies were evaluated. Memantine treatment significantly improved the course of CIA, reducing synovitis (p = 0.007) and the frequency of erosions (p = 0.007). Memantine treatment up-regulated the expression of Foxp3 in spleen CD4+ T cells followed by an increase in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. The other GluR antagonists, AIDA and KA, had no effect on CIA. These results demonstrate that blockade of the NMDA receptor channel with memantine delays and attenuates the development of arthritis, probably by promoting the development of regulatory T lymphocytes.",

To assess whether other N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist have an improved therapeutic utility index, we compared antinociceptive, side effect, and locomotor activity of three N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. METHODS: Ketamine, its active metabolite norketamine, and the NR2B-selective antagonist traxoprodil (CP-101,606) were tested in rat models of acute antinociception (paw-withdrawal response to heat) and chronic neuropathic pain (spared nerve injury). Side effects (stereotypical behavior, activity level) were scored and locomotor function of the nerve-injured paw was assessed using computerized gait analysis. In the chronic pain model, treatment was given 7 days after surgery, for 3 h on 5 consecutive days. RESULTS: All three N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists caused dose-dependent antinociception in the acute pain model and relief of mechanical and cold allodynia for 3-6 weeks after treatment in the chronic pain model (P < 0.05 vs. saline). In both tests, ketamine was most potent. Norketamine was as much as two times less potent and traxoprodil was up to 8 times less potent than ketamine (based on area under the curve measures). Nerve injury caused an inability to use the affected paw that either did not improve after treatment (ketamine, traxoprodil) or showed only a limited effect (norketamine). Traxoprodil, but not ketamine or norketamine, showed clear separation between effect and side effect. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that traxoprodil causes relief of chronic pain outlasting the treatment period with no side effects makes it an attractive alternative to ketamine in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabinoids bind to cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 and produce analgesia in several pain models, but central side effects from cannabinoid 1 receptors limit their clinical use. Because of the pain-relieving effects of cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor agonists in inflammation pain, incision pain, and neuropathic pain models, we tested whether spinal CB2 receptor activation would induce antihyperalgesia in cancer pain. Our previous study showed that the 2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NR2B) receptor in the spinal cord participates in bone cancer pain in mice. In the present study, we also tested the cannabinoid effect on the expression of NR2B. METHODS: Seventy-two mice were randomly allocated to 7 different groups: (1) control; (2) sham and tumor-bearing mice, which include (3) V; (4) J1; (5) J2; (6) J3; and (7) J4. In the groups of tumor-bearing mice, C(3)H/Hej mice were implanted with NCTC2472 fibrosarcoma cells into the femur bone to induce bone cancer-related pain behaviors. The sham mice were implanted with minimal essential medium α modification, whereas the control mice received no injection. On day 14 after implantation, tumor-invoked tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed. Tumor-bearing mice were assigned to intrathecal administration of the CB2 receptor agonist JWH015 (0.5, 1, and 2 μg), CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 (2 μg), or vehicle, and the assessment of withdrawal thresholds was then performed. Tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed before administration and at 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after administration. Spinal NR2B activation of all tumor-bearing mice at 12 hours and 72 hours were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses. RESULTS: At day 14 after operation, tumor-evoked tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were higher in tumor-bearing mice compared with the sham and control mice. Intrathecal administration of JWH015 dose dependently attenuated tumor-evoked tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia but this effect was prevented by intrathecal administration of AM630 30 minutes before. The mRNA expression of NR2B was similar to this result. At 12 hours after administration, the expression of NR2B mRNA in the spinal cord was lower in mice that were administered JWH015 compared with the vehicle group. However, this phenomenon was reversed in the group that was preadministered AM630. CONCLUSION: These data indicated that intrathecal administration of cannabinoid receptor agonists might relieve cancer pain, probably by reducing NR2B-dependent activity in the spinal cord. These results also suggested that cannabinoids might be a useful alternative or adjunct therapy for relieving cancer pain.",

This study was performed to investigate the relationship between NO-mediated cell death of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10, 11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5, 10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK801). METHODS: Human PDLFs were treated with various concentrations (0 to 4 mM) of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) with or without 200 µM MK801 in culture media for 16 hours and the cell medium was then removed and replaced by fresh medium containing MTS reagent for cell proliferation assay. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the effects of SNP on the expression of Bax, cytochrome c, and caspase-3 proteins. The differences for each value among the sample groups were compared using analysis of variance with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: In the case of SNP treatment, as a NO donor, cell viability was significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, a synergistic effect was shown when both SNP and NMDA receptor antagonist was added to the medium. SNP treated PDLFs exhibited a round shape in culture conditions and were dramatically reduced in cell number. SNP treatment also increased levels of apoptotic marker protein, such as Bax and cytochrome c, and reduced caspase-3 in PDLFs. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was activated by treatment of SNP and NMDA receptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that excessive production of NO may induce apoptosis and that NMDA receptor may modulate NO-induced apoptosis in PDLFs."

      "abstract": "OBJECT: Neuroinflammation, which is characterized by the overproduction of cytokines and chemokines, plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the brain, chemokines are predominantly released by astrocytes and microglias. Expression of RANTES, as well as other cytokines, is involved in the inflammatory cascade that contributes to neurodegeneration in AD. Expression of RANTES may also have a neuroprotective effect. We sought to investigate whether curcumin exhibited neuroprotective and antioxidant activity via enhanced RANTES expression by astrocytes in cortical neuron cultures. We evaluated the neuroprotective and anti-neurodegenerative effects of curcumin in NMDA toxicity and in long-term cultures. METHODS: Pregnant female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used for primary culture of cortical neurons, and neonatal 0- to 2-day-old SD rats were used for primary culture of astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were conditioned with curcumin to prepare astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess RANTES and iNOS mRNA expression in astrocytes following curcumin treatment. ELISA was used to detect astrocyte-secreted RANTES protein in ACM with curcumin treatment. JAK/STAT, PI-3K, PKC and MAPK inhibitors were used to ascertain whether the effects of curcumin involved these signaling pathways. To evaluate the effects of curcumin-enhanced astrocytes on neuronal survival, cultured cortical neurons treated or untreated with NMDA were incubated in ACM with or without curcumin treatment. Long-term culture (15days in vitro, DIV) was performed to investigate the effects of curcumin-treated astrocytes on the survival of cultured cortical neurons. Neuronal survival rate was assessed by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction activity assay (for cell viability), and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay (for cell death). RESULTS: We demonstrated that curcumin enhanced RANTES expression in primary cultured astrocytes, and that this effect was related to activation of PI-3K and MAPK signaling pathways. We found that curcumin inhibited iNOS expression in primary cultured astrocytes in non-stressed condition. We also found that neurons exposed to NMDA and cultured with curcumin treated ACM, which characteristically exhibited elevated RANTES expression showed higher level of cell viability and lower level of cell death. Using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown model, we found evidence that the basal level of RANTES expression in non-stimulated astrocytes provided neuroprotection. CONCLUSION: We postulate that the enhanced neuronal survival by curcumin treatment in NMDA toxicity and long-term cultures was in part attributable to elevated astrocyte-derived RANTES expression via activation of PI3K/MAPK signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "We have previously shown that β-amyloid (Aβ) treatment resulted in an age-dependent calpain activation leading to Tau cleavage into a neurotoxic 17-kDa fragment in a cellular model of Alzheimer disease. This detrimental cellular response was mediated by a developmentally regulated increase in membrane cholesterol levels. In this study, we assessed the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol modulated Aβ-induced Tau cleavage in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results indicated that these mechanisms did not involve the regulation of the binding of Aβ aggregates to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, experiments using N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor inhibitors suggested that these receptors played an essential role in cholesterol-mediated Aβ-dependent calpain activity and 17-kDa Tau production. Biochemical and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that decreasing membrane cholesterol levels in mature neurons resulted in a significant reduction of the NR1 subunit at the membrane as well as an increase in the number of large NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunit clusters. Moreover, the majority of these larger N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunit immunoreactive spots was not juxtaposed to presynaptic sites in cholesterol-reduced neurons. These data suggested that changes at the synaptic level underlie the mechanism by which membrane cholesterol modulates developmental changes in the susceptibility of hippocampal neurons to Aβ-induced toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain is more sensitive to stressors and consumes significant quantities of alcohol under basal as well as stressful conditions when compared to other strains. Given that the glutamate neurotransmitter system has been implicated in depression and addiction, the goals of the present study were to investigate the effects of stress and stress-alcohol interactions on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the rat brain. Thus this study measured the binding of [(3)H] MK-801 to NMDA receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), caudate putamen (CPu), nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus (HIP) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in WKY rats in comparison to the Wistar (WIS) rat strain. Our results suggested that while voluntary alcohol consumption did not alter NMDA receptors in the PFC, CPu or NAc in either rat strain, it increased NMDA receptors in the HIP and BLA in both strains. In contrast, chronic stress increased NMDA receptors in the PFC, CPu, NAc in WKY rats but not in WIS rats. Chronic stress also decreased NMDA receptors in the HIP and increased NMDA receptors in the BLA in both strains. Alcohol co-treatment with stress increased NMDA receptors in the PFC, CPu and NAc in WKY rats but not in WIS rats. Interestingly, while alcohol co-treatment did not reverse stress induced decreases in NMDA receptors in the HIP, it reduced the binding of NMDA receptors in the BLA to control levels in both strains. Thus it appears that NMDA receptors in the PFC, CPu and NAc may be more sensitive to the effects of stress and could be implicated in the stress-induced alcohol consumption behavior seen in WKY rats. In contrast, NMDA receptors in the HIP and BLA may reflect an adaptive response and may not be responsible for the stress susceptible phenotype of the WKY rat strain.",

High concentrations of free D-Asp were found in the testes (0.21+/-0.02 micromol/g b.w), in the liver (0.20+/-0.03 micromol/g b.w), and in the Harderian gland (HG) (0.19+/-0.03 micromol/g b.w). A higher activity of both D-AspO and D-AAO with respect to L-AAO was endogenously present in all examined frog tissues, particularly within the kidney, liver, and brain. Our in vivo experiments, consisting of i.p. injections of 2.0 micromol/g b.w. D-Asp in frogs, revealed that all examined tissues can take up and accumulate D-Asp and that this amino acid specifically triggers D-AspO activity. Indeed, no increase in both D-AAO and L-AAO was found in all frog tissues after D-Asp treatment. The optimum pH for D-AspO activity was around 8.2 and the optimum temperature was about 37 degrees C. Furthermore, its activity linearly increased with increasing D-Asp incubation times. In vitro experiments assaying the substrate specificity of D-AspO indicated that the enzyme had greater affinity for N-methyl-D-aspartate than for D-Asp and D-glutamate. This study provides evidence of the presence of free D-Asp in frog R. esculenta tissues, along with its role in triggering D-AspO activity. These findings suggest that D-AspO could play an essential role in decreasing excessive amounts of D-Asp in frog tissues, a phenomenon that, if left unchecked, could have detrimental physiological effects on the animal.",

Oral administration of sodium D-aspartate (40 mM) for 12-16 days improved the rats' cognitive capability to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze system. Two sessions per day for three consecutive days were performed in two groups of 12 rats. One group was treated with Na-D-aspartate and the other with control. A significant increase in the cognitive effect was observed in the treated group compared to controls (two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements: F ((2, 105)) = 57.29; P value < 0.001). Five further sessions of repeated training, involving a change in platform location, also displayed a significant treatment effect [F ((2, 84)) = 27.62; P value < 0.001]. In the hippocampus of treated rats, D-Asp increased by about 2.7-fold compared to controls (82.5 +/- 10.0 vs. the 30.6 +/- 5.4 ng/g tissue; P < 0.0001). Moreover, 20 randomly selected rats possessing relatively high endogenous concentrations of D-Asp in the hippocampus were much faster in reaching the hidden platform, an event suggesting that their enhanced cognitive capability was functionally related to the high levels of D-Asp. The correlation coefficient calculated in the 20 rats was R = -0.916 with a df of 18; P < 0.001. In conclusion, this study provides corroborating evidence that D-aspartic acid plays an important role in the modulation of learning and memory.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. As dementia progresses to the end stage and patients become hospice-eligible, clinicians consider whether or not to continue these therapies without the benefit of scientific evidence. We sought to describe hospice medical directors practice patterns and experiences in the use and discontinuation of cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists in hospice patients that meet the Medicare hospice criteria for dementia. STUDY DESIGN: Mail survey of hospice medical directors from a random sample from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. RESULTS: Of the 413 eligible participants, 152 completed surveys were returned, yielding a response rate of 37%. Of the respondents, 75% and 33% reported that at least 20% of their patients were taking a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, respectively, at the time of hospice admission. The majority of respondents do not consider these therapies effective in persons with end-stage dementia, however, a subset believe that these medications improved patient outcomes including stabilization of cognition (22%), decrease in challenging behaviors (28%), and maintenance of patient function (22%) as well as caregiver outcomes namely reduced caregiver burden (20%) and improved caregiver quality of life (20%). While 80% of respondents recommended discontinuing these therapies to families at the time of hospice enrollment, 72% of respondents reported that families experienced difficulty stopping these therapies. A subset of respondents observed accelerated cognitive (30%) and functional decline (26%) or emergence of challenging behaviors (32%) with medication discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this survey indicate that cholinesterase inhibitors and/or NMDA receptor antagonists are prescribed for a subset of patients with advanced dementia and that a proportion of hospice medical directors report clinical benefit from the ongoing use of these agents. In addition, physician preferences for discontinuing these therapies are frequently at odds with the wishes of family members. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical impact of the discontinuation of these therapies on patient and caregiver outcomes.",

METHODS: According to simple random method, 46 Wistar rats were divided into burn group (B, with 30% TBSA deep partial-thickness burn, n = 10), depression group (D, with moderate stress stimulation in chronic and unpredictable, n = 12), B + D group (with the same stress stimulation inflicted to B group after burn, n = 12), healthy control group ( HC, without treatment, n = 12). Changes in escape latency was examined in water maze test. Expression of hippocampal NMDA in CA1, CA2 regions and dentate gyrus were observed with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with that of HC group (22 +/- 20 s), water maze escape latency in B, D, B + D groups on 2 day after training prolonged (38 +/- 31, 41 +/- 36, 42 +/- 33 s, respectively, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Water maze escape latency in B + D group on 4th day after training was longer than that of other groups (P < 0.01). There was no obvious difference in positive expression of NMDA in CA1, CA2 regions among groups (P > 0.05). The positive count of NMDA in dentate gyrus in D group (198 +/- 14) and B + D group (191 +/- 6) were lower than that of HC group (224 +/- 23, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but there was no obvious difference between HC group and B group (219 +/- 25, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Burn complicated with depression can reduce LMA, which may be due to a decrease in NMDA in dentate gyrus.",

      "abstract": "The current study provides substantial evidence that the pattern of synthesis of D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) in the testes of lizard Podarcis s. sicula throughout the reproductive cycle is in parallel with seasonal variations of testosterone, c-kit receptor protein, tyrosine kinase activity, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein. Although the trend is the same in all phases of the sexual cycle, the peaks of these three molecules are detectable only during the reproductive period. Using Western blot technique, we demonstrated that both polyclonal c-kit and PCNA antibodies specifically recognized bands with molecular mass of approximately 150 and approximately 36 kDa, respectively. By immunocytochemical methods, D-Asp immunopositivity appeared spread in the germinal epithelium as well as in the interstitial compartment of the testes. We also found specific c-kit labeling in I and II spermatogonia (SPG), in I and II spermatocytes (SPC), in the elongated spermatides, in spermatozoa, in Sertoli and Leydig cells. Like c-kit, PCNA positivity was located in the germinal epithelium pattern. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between testosterone, c-kit receptor, tyrosine kinases activity and PCNA following treatment with D-Asp. In vivo experiments, entailing a single injection of D-Asp (2.0 micromol/g body weight), demonstrated that this amino acid significantly accumulated in the testes. After 3 h, its uptake was accompanied by an increase in testosterone levels and in the expression and intensity of immunostaining of c-kit receptor protein. Furthermore, at 6 h, exogenous D-Asp affected the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases, whose activation was positively correlated with the temporal uptake of both D-Asp and testosterone detected in the testes. Thereafter, between 6 and 15 h, the expression of PCNA was induced and an increase in its immunolabeling intensity was observed. Taken all together, these results provide new insights into the testicular activity during the reproductive cycle of Podarcis s. sicula, suggesting that a sequential cascade of a functional relationship between testosterone levels, c-kit receptor protein, tyrosine kinase activity and PCNA could be partly mediated by D-aspartic acid.",

We investigated the effects of the NMDAR antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) on the expression of NMDAR subtypes in the identified interneurons in young adult rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) by using laser microdissection and real-time polymerase chain reaction, combined with Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. We found that MK-801 induced distinct changes of NMDAR subunits in the parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV-ir) interneurons vs. pyramidal neurons in the PFC circuitry. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of all NMDAR subtypes, including NR1 and NR2A to 2D, exhibited inverted-U dose-dependent changes in response to MK-801 treatment in the PFC. In contrast, subunit mRNAs of NMDARs in PV-ir interneurons were significantly down-regulated at low doses, unaltered at medium doses, and significantly decreased again at high doses, suggesting a biphasic dose response to MK-801. The differential effects of MK-801 in mRNA expression of NMDAR subunits were consistent with the protein expression of NR2A and NR2B subunits revealed with Western blotting and double immunofluorescent staining. These results suggest that PV-containing interneurons in the PFC exhibit a distinct responsiveness to NMDAR antagonism and that NMDA antagonist can differentially and dose-dependently regulate the functions of pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the prefrontal cortical circuitry.",

In the present study, we determined the extent of oxidative stress in the testis of prepubertal rats that were administered D-Asp (100 and 500 mg/kg bw/d, i.p. 7 days). D-Asp treatment significantly elevated the levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and hydroperoxide in cytosol and mitochondria of testis, which were accompanied by enhanced glutathione levels, elevated activities of glutathione-dependent enzymes and catalase suggesting a state of oxidative stress. Further, the activities of D-aspartate oxidase and 3beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase were elevated in the testis. The testis mitochondria of D-Asp-treated rats showed altered citric acid and complex enzyme activities, reduction in membrane potential, increased permeability and intracellular Ca(2+) levels. Collectively, these findings suggest the potential of D-Asp to induce oxidative perturbations in the testis of prepubertal rats and this mechanism may in part be responsible for the observed physiological effects.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Electrophysiological responses to auditory stimuli have provided a useful means of elucidating mechanisms and evaluating treatments in psychiatric disorders. Deficits in gating during paired-click tasks and lack of mismatch negativity following deviant stimuli have been well characterized in patients with schizophrenia. Recently, analyses of basal, induced, and evoked frequency oscillations have gained support as additional measures of cognitive processing in patients and animal models. The purpose of this study is to examine frequency oscillations in mice across the theta (4-7.5 Hz) and gamma (31-61 Hz) bands in the context of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction and dopaminergic hyperactivity, both of which are thought to serve as pharmacological models of schizophrenia. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded from mice in five treatment groups that consisted of haloperidol, risperidone, amphetamine, ketamine, or ketamine plus haloperidol during an auditory task. Basal, induced and evoked powers in both frequencies were calculated. RESULTS: Ketamine increased basal power in the gamma band and decreased the evoked power in the theta band. The increase in basal gamma was not blocked by treatment with a conventional antipsychotic. No other treatment group was able to fully reproduce this pattern in the mice. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-induced alterations in EEG power spectra are consistent with abnormalities in the theta and gamma frequency ranges reported in patients with schizophrenia. Our findings support the hypothesis that NMDAR hypofunction contributes to the deficits in schizophrenia and that the dopaminergic pathways alone may not account for these changes.",

In recent years integration of the dopamine and glutamate signaling pathways has received increasing attention. This research has been fueled by the fact that many psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, seem to be due to imbalances in both the glutamatergic and the dopaminergic system, and that many addictive drugs seem to affect both systems. Thus more knowledge about the interaction between the glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems will have important implications for the generation of new treatment for psychiatric disorders. This review will focus on the intraneuronal interaction between the glutamate and dopamine systems.",

      "abstract": "Abnormalities in glutamatergic signalling are proposed in schizophrenia in light of the schizophreniform psychosis elicited by NMDA antagonists. The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) interacts closely with the NMDA receptor and is implicated in several behavioural endophenotypes of schizophrenia. We have demonstrated that mice lacking mGluR5 have increased sensitivity to the hyperlocomotive effects of the NMDA antagonist MK-801. Mice lacking mGluR5 also show abnormal locomotor patterns, reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI), and deficits on performance of a short-term spatial memory task on the Y-maze. Chronic administration of the antipsychotic drug clozapine ameliorated the locomotor disruption and reversed the PPI deficit, but did not improve Y-maze performance. Chronic clozapine increased NMDA receptor binding ([3H]MK-801) but did not alter dopamine D2 ([3H]YM-09151), 5-HT2A ([3H]ketanserin), or muscarinic M1/M4 receptor ([3H]pirenzepine), binding in these mice. These results demonstrate behavioural abnormalities that are relevant to schizophrenia in the mGluR5 knockout mouse and a reversal of behaviours with clozapine treatment. These results highlight both the interactions between mGluR5 and NMDA receptors in the determination of schizophreniform behaviours and the potential for the effects of clozapine to be mediated by NMDA receptor regulation.",

DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Administrative database of a national hospice pharmacy provider. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10,065 persons with end-stage dementia admitted to one of 441 U.S. hospices in 2004. MEASUREMENTS: The frequency of AChEI and memantine use was determined and utilized as the unit of analysis for bivariate and multivariate comparisons with patient and hospice program characteristics. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent (2148/10,065) of patients were prescribed AChEI and/or memantine therapy at the time of hospice enrollment. Of these, 49.5% were prescribed donepezil. Odds of receiving AChEI and/or memantine therapy were less likely if the patient was female, (odds ratio [OR] 0.68, 0.62-0.76), died while enrolled in hospice (OR 0.75, 0.67-0.85), received care at home (0.80, 0.71-0.89), or had a hospice length of stay (LOS) less than 7 days (0.53, 0.45-0.62). Patients who had a LOS of at least 60 days were significantly more likely to have received such therapies (OR 1.41 [1.24-1.60] for 61-180 days and 1.33 [1.15-1.54] for over 180 days). CONCLUSION: A notable number of hospice enrollees with a primary diagnosis of dementia were prescribed AChEI and/or NMDA receptor antagonist therapy. Studies are needed to better define the role of these agents as well as the impact of medication discontinuation in persons with end-stage dementia.",

In all three preparations, DA enhanced (P<0.001) lipid peroxidation, manifest as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Further, DA-induced oxidative induction was potentiated (P<0.001) in the presence of iron (5 microM) and 3-amino triazole and mercaptosuccinate (P<0.001), known inhibitors of the peroxide metabolizing enzymes, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, respectively. Testis homogenates exposed to L-arginine (LA) per se had reduced (P<0.001) endogenous levels of ROS and MDA; furthermore, pre-incubation with L-arginine markedly suppressed (P<0.001) DA-induced oxidative induction, suggesting an antagonistic action, perhaps due to LA-derived nitric oxide. In conclusion, DA caused significant oxidative induction in prepubertal rat testis, but this action was abrogated by L-arginine. The relevance of this phenomenon in vivo merits further study, as both of these molecules have specific physiological functions in the testis.",

Here we develop a new model of flexion spasms based on prenatal exposure to betamethasone combined with postnatal administration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and determine brain structures involved in the induction of flexion spasms. METHODS: Pregnant rats received two doses of betamethasone on day 15 of gestation. Offspring was injected with NMDA on postnatal day 15. Effects of adrenocorticotropin therapy on the development of age-specific flexion spasms were determined and electroencephalographic correlates recorded. C-fos immunohistochemistry and [14C]2-deoxyglucose imaging identified brain structures involved in the development of flexion spasms. RESULTS: Prenatal betamethasone exposure sensitizes rats to development of NMDA-induced spasms and, most importantly, renders the spasms sensitive to adrenocorticotropin therapy. Ictal electroencephalogram results correspond to human infantile spasms: electrodecrement or afterdischarges were observed. Imaging studies defined three principal regions involved in NMDA spasms: limbic areas (except the dorsal hippocampus), hypothalamus, and the brainstem. INTERPRETATION: Despite certain limitations, our new model correlates well with current infantile spasm hypotheses and opens an opportunity for development and testing of new effective drugs.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between Akt activity and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death induced by N-Methyl-D-Aspartic acid (NMDA) in the rat retina. METHODS: Two microlitres of 1, 10, 50, 100, or 200 mM NMDA, or vehicle was injected into the vitreous cavity of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n=125). Retinal damage was estimated by counting ganglion cells labeled with fluorochrome and retinal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL. Akt activity was determined by immunohistochemical analysis with a specific antibody to the activated (phosphorylated) form of Akt. To investigate the mechanism of dephosphorylation of Akt, Okadaic acid, a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, was injected 1 h before NMDA injury and accessed the number of phosphorylated Akt positive cells 1 h after NMDA injection. To stimulate Akt activity in the retina, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was injected into the vitreous 15 min before NMDA injection. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a reduction in phosphorylated Akt in RGCs and amacrine cells one hour after NMDA injury. The RGCs and amacrine cells showed TUNEL positivity at 6 h and a decrease in cell number at 7 days after NMDA injury. No other cells in the retina stained positive with phosphorylated Akt antibody and TUNEL. Okadaic acid prevented the dephosphorylation of Akt by NMDA. The exogenous administration of BDNF prevented the dephosphorylation of Akt in N-Shc/ShcC-positive RGCs and significantly suppressed the NMDA-induced RGC death. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that Akt is one of the key signaling proteins in RGC death induced by NMDA, and that the presence of N-Shc/ShcC enhances BDNF-mediated neuroprotection via phosphorylated Akt. The regulation of phosphorylated Akt by growth factors and protein phosphatase activity may play an important role in cell fate following NMDA injury. Thus, an increase in phosphorylated Akt may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of glutamate-related disease.",

SCG10 is a neuronal-specific stathmin protein with microtubule destabilizing activity that is affected by multiple phosphorylation, at least in vitro. SCG10 has four major phosphorylation sites: Ser50 and Ser97 targeted by protein kinase A (PKA), and Ser62 and Ser73 targeted by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). To explore the potential roles of site-specific phosphorylation in physiological models, we developed phosphorylation site-specific antibodies and examined the SCG10 status in primary cultured hippocampal neurons and tissues. Although SCG10 is concentrated in growth cones and the Golgi apparatus in primary cultured neurons, the phosphorylated form was also detected in both regions, suggesting that MT dynamics within the growth cone may be regulated by protein phosphorylation. In the adult hippocampus, an intense stimulus such as kainate treatment induced a rapid phosphorylation of Ser73 within 15 min that was sustained for at least 60 min. This response was mediated through the N-methyl D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor and was ablated by the antagonist MK-801. The MAPK enzyme Erk2 was simultaneously activated along a similar time course to SCG10, suggesting that Erk2 may directly phosphorylate Ser73. These results demonstrate that changes in the phosphorylation status of SCG10 in vivo, dependent upon neural activity and/or plasticity, could affect the microtubule dynamics in neuronal dendrites.",

SETTING: Department of Pathophysiology for Human Reproduction, Hospital \"S. Luca,\" Salerno, Italy, and Department of Neurobiology and Comparative Physiology, Zoological Station \"A. Dohrn,\" Naples, Italy. PATIENT(S): Ten normospermic, 10 oligoasthenoteratospermic, and 10 azoospermic (nonobstructive) men. INTERVENTION(S): D-aspartic acid was determined by a specific enzymatic high-performance liquid chromatography method on purified seminal plasma and on isolated spermatozoa and by an immunohistochemical method using light and electronic microscopic techniques. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Concentration of D-Asp in seminal plasma and in isolated spermatozoa; subcellular localization of D-Asp in the acrosome and nucleus. RESULT(S): The concentration of D-Asp in seminal plasma and in spermatozoa was significantly reduced in oligoasthenoteratospermic donors. In the seminal fluid of normospermic donors, D-Asp occurs at a concentration of 80 +/- 12 nmol/mL semen (10.4 +/- 1.5 microg/mL), whereas 26 +/- 6 nmol/mL semen were found in oligoasthenoteratospermic donors, and 12 +/- 1.5 nmol/mL semen were found in azoospermic donors. In spermatozoa from normospermic donors, D-Asp occurred at a concentration of 130 +/-15 fmol per spermatozoa (17.0 +/- 1.96 ng per spermatozoa), vs. 60.5 +/- 5.0 fmol per spermatozoa from oligoasthenoteratospermic subjects. Other D-amino acids analyzed were not present in seminal plasma or in spermatozoa in a significant concentration compared with D-Asp. CONCLUSION(S): D-aspartic acid occurs in human seminal plasma and spermatozoa and is implicated in male fertility.",

However, the capsaicin concentration dependency of the development of secondary mechanical allodynia and the underlying mechanisms of development and maintenance of capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia are not fully understood. In the present study, we clarify the capsaicin concentration dependency for development and maintenance of secondary mechanical allodynia and the role of spinal opioid receptor like1 (ORL1) receptor and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the development and maintenance of secondary mechanical allodynia induced by an intradermal capsaicin injection. Capsaicin 50 microL of 0.03% induced the most intense secondary mechanical allodynia. Intrathecal injection of nociceptin, an ORL1 receptor agonist, attenuated the maintenance of secondary mechanical allodynia but had no effect on the development of secondary mechanical allodynia. An intrathecal injection of MK801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, had no effect on the development and maintenance of secondary mechanical allodynia. These findings suggest that spinal ORL1 receptor should be the target of study for the treatment of secondary mechanical allodynia induced by tissue injury.",

Unilateral intrastriatal administration of NMDA to rats resulted in the loss of intrinsic striatal neurones and the degeneration of NADPH-diaphorase positive interneurones within 24 h. NMDA administration caused activation of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive astroglial cells and MAC-1 ir microglia. Marked iNOS immunoreactivity was expressed within both astroglial and microglial cells and there was marked cellular labelling for 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). One month following the NMDA lesion, administration of (+)-amphetamine (AMPH) produced a circling response in rats. Pre-treatment of rats with the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG) decreased the extent of NMDA-induced striatal cell loss at 24 h and reduced 3-NT expression but was without effect on glial cell activation. AG pre-treatment also prevented the onset of rotation to AMPH at 30 days following NMDA lesioning. NMDA administration unexpectedly caused a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-ir) fibres in the striatum at 24 h and at 30 days the number of TH-ir cells were decreased in the substantia nigra. The loss of nigral cells was prevented by AG pre-treatment. This study demonstrates a role for iNOS induction in NO-mediated NMDA excitotoxicity to rat striatum and suggests that inflammatory mechanisms play a key role in this process.",

In 8 patients with chronic PLP, memantine was tested in a placebo-controlled double-blinded crossover trial of 4 wk duration per trial. The intensity of PLP was rated hourly by the patients on a visual analog scale during baseline and both treatment periods. At the same time points, the functional organization of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was determined by neuromagnetic source imaging. In comparison to baseline and placebo, the NMDA receptor antagonist had no effect on the intensity of chronic PLP. In none of the periods were significant changes in the functional organization of SI observed. Although the conclusions regarding the clinical effect are limited because of the small sample size, the data indicate that in the studied dosage the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine is ineffective in the treatment of chronic PLP and is also ineffective for the reduction of associated neural plasticity in the primary SI. IMPLICATIONS: NMDA receptors play a substantial role in central nervous system changes underlying neuropathic pain. In a placebo-controlled double-blinded study we tested the effect of 30 mg memantine on chronic phantom limb pain and pain-associated cortical reorganization.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Developmental changes in NR1 splice variants and NR2 subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor have been associated with changes in the sensitivity of NMDA receptors to agonists, antagonists, and pharmacologic modulators. The authors have investigated changes in the effect of isoflurane on NMDA-gated currents from cultured cortical neurons with time in culture and related these changes to the subunit composition of the NMDA receptors. METHODS: N-methyl-D-aspartate-gated currents were measured using whole-cell voltage clamp recording in cortical neurons cultured for 1-4 weeks and HEK 293 cells transiently expressing NR1-1a + NR2A or NR1-1a + NR2B subunit-containing receptors. NMDA alone or NMDA with treatment agents (isoflurane or ifenprodil) was applied to cells using a U tube. RESULTS: The effect of isoflurane and the NR2B selective antagonist ifenprodil on NMDA-gated currents from cortical neurons decreased significantly with time in culture. NMDA-gated currents mediated by NR2A-containing receptors were less sensitive to isoflurane than those mediated by NR2B-containing receptors. Tachyphylaxis to repeated application of isoflurane was found in cortical neurons and HEK 293 cells with recombinant NMDA receptors. Hooked tail currents were induced by isoflurane in cultured cortical neurons and HEK 293 cells with expressed NMDA receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane inhibits NMDA-gated currents at concentrations well below 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). This effect of isoflurane was subunit dependent with the NR2B-containing receptors more sensitive to isoflurane than the NR2A-containing receptors. A potent tachyphylaxis occurred after brief exposure to isoflurane.",

      "abstract": "Recently we demonstrated that N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) is present as an endogenous compound in the nervous tissues and endocrine glands of the rat where it plays a role in the regulation of the luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, and prolactin (FASEB J. 14 (2000) 699; Endocrinology 141 (2000) 3861). Based on the prediction that NMDA could have future importance in neuroendocrinology, we have devised an improved method for the specific and routine determination of NMDA in biological tissue. This method is based on the detection by HPLC of methylamine (CH(3)NH(2)) which comes from the oxidation of NMDA by D-aspartate oxidase, an enzyme which specifically oxidizes NMDA, yielding CH(3)NH(2) as one of the oxidative products of the reaction. The sensitivity of the method permits the accurate determination of NMDA in the supernatant of a tissue homogenate at levels of about 5-10 picomol/assay. However, for those tissues in which the concentration of NMDA is less than 1nmol/g, the sample must be further purified by treatment with o-phthaldialdehyde in order to separate the NMDA from the other amino acids and amino compounds and then concentrated and analyzed by HPLC. Using this method we have conducted a comparative study in order to measure the amount of NMDA in neuroendocrine and other tissues of various animal phyla from mollusks to mammals.",

The average food intake was 8.6 g in 50 min, and during the infusion rats spent 26% of the time eating, compared to less than 1% before NMDA treatment. In contrast, NMDA did not affect feeding when reverse dialyzed into the anterior LH (aLH), posterior LH (pLH) or the medial hypothalamus (MH). NMDA had no apparent behavioral effect in the aLH; in contrast, it significantly decreased the time spent resting/sleeping when infused into each of the other three areas tested. Additionally, in the medial hypothalamus, NMDA infusions increased time spent grooming; while in the pLH only alertness was significantly increased. These data underscore the functional and anatomical heterogeneity of the hypothalamus, and implicate glutamate and NMDA receptors in different portions of the hypothalamus in the control of eating, grooming and arousal.",

It was determined that D-Asp concentrations vary significantly during phases of the reproductive cycle: they vary inversely with testosterone concentrations and directly with oestradiol concentrations in the ovary and plasma. Experimental treatment showed that administration of D-Asp induces a decrease in testosterone and an increase in oestradiol, and that treatment with other amino acids (L-Asp, D-Glu and D-Ala) instead of D-Asp has no effects. Experiments in vitro confirmed these results. Furthermore, these experiments showed an increase in aromatase activity, as the addition of D-Asp either to fresh ovarian tissue homogenate or to acetonic powder of ovarian follicles induced a significant increase in the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol. Aromatase activity is four times greater in the presence of D-Asp than in its absence. However, almost equivalent values of the two K(m) values (both approximately 25 nmol l(-1)) indicate that aromatase has the same catalytic properties in both cases.",

The animals were divided into four experimental groups: 1, saline control; 2, metaphit-injected; 3, metaphit + NMDA administered and 4, NMDA-treated. Upon the treatment, the rats were exposed to sound stimulation (100 +/- 3 dB, for 60 s) at hourly intervals and the incidence and severity (running, clonus and tonus) of seizures were analysed. In group 3, only the animals which did not exhibit any metaphit-induced audiogenic seizures over 8 h were given a subconvulsive NMDA dose after the eighth audiogenic testing. For EEG recordings, three gold-plated screws were implanted into the rat skull. In most animals, metaphit led to EEG abnormalities and elicited epileptiform activity recorded as spikes, polyspikes and spike-wave complexes. Maximum incidence and severity of metaphit-induced convulsions occurred 8 h after injection (incidence 9/12), abating gradually until disappearing 30 h later. NMDA alone provoked no seizure response but the initial signs characterized by isolated spike activity evolving into sporadic slow-wave complexes, thus representing a proconvulsive brain state, were observed. This compound led to stereotyped behaviour seen as asymmetric posture, loss of righting reflex and tonic hind limb extension lasting for 60-90 min. It also potentiated metaphit-induced audiogenic seizures. Potentiation of metaphit-related audiogenic seizures by NMDA was recorded in three out of 17 rats that had never displayed seizures in eight previous testings, with a maximum incidence of eight out of 17 animals, 13-14 h after metaphit administration and seizures lasted for 10 h.",

      "abstract": "Our recent identification of glutamate receptors in bone cells suggested a novel means of paracrine communication in the skeleton. To determine whether these receptors are functional, we investigated the effects of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate, and the pharmacological ligand, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), on glutamate-like receptors in the human osteoblastic cell lines MG63 and SaOS-2. Glutamate binds to osteoblasts, with a Kd of approximately 10(-4) mol/L and the NMDA receptor antagonist, D(L)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV), inhibits binding. Using the patch-clamp technique, we measured whole-cell currents before and after addition of L-glutamate or NMDA and investigated the effects of the NMDA channel blockers, dizolcipine maleate (MK801), and Mg2+, and the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphoric acid (R-CPP), on agonist-induced currents. Both glutamate and NMDA induced significant increases in membrane currents. Application of Mg2+ (200 micromol/L) and MK801 (100 micromol/L) caused a significant decrease in inward currents elicited in response to agonist stimulation. The competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, R-CPP (100 micromol/L), also partially blocked the NMDA-induced currents in MG63 cells. This effect was reversed by addition of further NMDA (100 micromol/L). In Fura-2-loaded osteoblasts, glutamate induced elevation of intracellular free calcium, which was blocked by MK801. These results support the hypothesis that glutamate plays a role in bone cell signaling and suggest a possible role for glutamate agonists/antagonists in the treatment of bone diseases.",

      "abstract": "The present study examined the regulatory mechanisms of GnRH gene expression by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) in immortalized hypothalamic GnRH neurons (GT1-1 cells). NMDA (100 microM) stimulated GnRH mRNA levels transiently at 2 h after treatment. Dose-response experiment showed that there was a biphasic action of NMDA on GnRH mRNA levels: GnRH mRNA levels were increased by NMDA at lower concentrations (10 and 100 microM), but not at higher concentrations (1 and 10 mM). NMDA (100 microM)-induced GnRH mRNA levels were efficiently blocked by pre-treatment with NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 and AP-5. We next examined the signal transduction pathways involved in NMDA-induced GnRH gene expression based on previous findings that NMDA signal propagates into the cell through Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) pathways in many neurons. While ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionopore, application failed to alter GnRH gene expression, treatment of GT1-1 cells with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, increased GnRH gene expression with a similar time course to NMDA treatment. Moreover, application of GT1-1 cells with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors (l-NAME, d-NAME, and NA) prior to NMDA treatment, inhibited NMDA-induced GnRH gene expression. These results indicate that the effect of NMDA is mediated by the NO signalling cascade. The mouse GnRH promoter activity was also increased by NMDA at low concentration (100 microM), but not at high concentration (1 microM), confirming the biphasic action of NMDA on GnRH mRNA levels. Since NMDA (100 microM) and SNP (1 microM) markedly induced c-jun expression, but not c-fos expression, we hypothesized that Jun activation is responsible for the transcriptional activation of GnRH gene expression. To examine this, we performed two different experiments. Treatment of NMDA greatly increased the activity of heterologous promoter of Fos/Jun responsive sequence (-187/-69) from the mouse GnRH promoter fused to hsv-tk minimal promoter. Moreover, overexpression of c-jun induced GnRH promoter activity, while c-fos overexpression decreased GnRH promoter activity. Taken together, this study indicates that NMDA regulates GnRH gene expression in GT1-1 cells through the NO-Jun signal transduction pathway.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The stimulatory and inhibitory effects of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and kainic acid on prolactin (PRL) secretion have been correlated with the serum prolactin concentrations before drug administration. In the present experiments, we analysed the role of NMDA and kainic acid in PRL secretion in females with different serum concentrations of PRL. METHODS: Hypoprolactinaemic females were obtained by ovariectomy or after administration of diethyldithiocarbamate (an inhibitor of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase). Chronic hyperprolactinaemia was induced by neonatal administration of testosterone or oestradiol and acute hyperprolactinaemia was induced either by administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase) or by ether exposure. To analyse the role of dopamine in the effects of NMDA, we measured pituitary concentrations of dopamine after NMDA treatment and the effects of pretreatment with domperidone. RESULTS: (1) NMDA, but not kainic acid, stimulated PRL release in cyclic females. This effect was independent of serum PRL concentrations and was not accompanied by a decrease in pituitary concentrations of dopamine. (2) NMDA did not change PRL secretion in neonatally androgenized females, whereas NMDA and kainic acid inhibited PRL release in neonatally oestrogenized females. The inhibitory effects of NMDA and kainic acid were blocked by domperidone. (3) Kainic acid inhibited PRL secretion in prepubertal hyper- and hypoprolactinaemic rats. (4) Hyperprolactinaemia induced by ether stress was counteracted by administration of NMDA and kainic acid. CONCLUSIONS: (a) NMDA has a dual effect on prolactin secretion that is independent of prior prolactin concentrations and of dopamine activity, but kainic acid is only inhibitory. (b) The stimulatory or inhibitory effects of NMDA and kainic acid on PRL secretion were not strictly related to basal PRL concentrations and necessarily involved a change in the secretion of prolactin releasing factors, as no correlations were observed between changes in pituitary concentrations of dopamine and serum PRL concentrations. (c) Females rendered hyperprolactinaemic by neonatal administration of testosterone or oestradiol responded differently after NMDA administration. (d) NMDA and kainic acid blocked the mechanisms involved in stress-induced PRL secretion.",

      "abstract": "In the current study, localization of D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) in rat testis was studied by immunohistochemical and biochemical techniques. Immunohistochemical staining of this tissue using specific polyclonal antibody to D-Asp revealed D-Asp immunoreactivity (IR) in the cytoplasm of germ cells, especially around the region rich in elongate spermatids, the most mature of the germ cells. Weak IR was also noted in cytoplasm of spermatocytes and round spermatids; however, it was negligible in interstitial cells and Sertoli cells. The intensity of immunostaining in each seminiferous tubule differed according to its distinct germ cell composition. In testis of young rats, seminiferous tubules lack elongated spermatids, and D-Asp was found to be localized in spermatocytes, the most mature population of germ cells at that age. We used various toxicants to destroy specific testicular cell populations and to confirm the localization of D-Asp in rat testis. Administration of ethane dimethane sulfonate induced a selective destruction of all Leydig cells in this tissue. This resulted in a significant decrease in the D-Asp level, which was probably due to a drop in testosterone brought about by this treatment, and this was followed by a modulation of spermatogenesis. Three days after treatment with methoxyacetic acid (MAA), many seminiferous tubules were found to lack or to have severe depletions of pachytene spermatocytes, but not of elongate spermatids. This caused reductions in protein content and in the total amount of L-Asp, but not that of D-Asp. Twenty days after treatment with MAA, the depleted population of germ cells progressed through the spermatogenic cycle from pachytene spermatocytes to elongate spermatids. At this time, the level of D-Asp decreased significantly, as did that of L-Asp and protein, consistent with D-Asp localization in elongate spermatids. This decrease in the D-Asp level was also seen with immunostaining.",

Pretreatment of rodents with ARL 15896AR extended survival time during exposure to hypoxia. With the rat four-vessel occlusion model of global ischemia (20 min), oral dosing commencing at reflow, resulted in significant protection of the CA1 hippocampal neurons. ARL 15896AR was, however, ineffective in the rat two-vessel occlusion model and in the gerbil models of forebrain ischemia, the latter due to an inability to attain suitable plasma levels. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (2 hr plus 22 hr reflow), acute dosing with ARL 15896AR (i.p.) beginning from 30 min before or up to 1 hr post-MCAO significantly reduced cortical infarct volume. The ability of ARL 15896AR to influence infarct size, as well as functional correlates was examined in SHR after 90 min of MCAO. T2 weighted magnetic resonance images taken at 2 and 6 days post-MCAO revealed significantly smaller lesion sizes in the group receiving injections with ARL 15896AR beginning 30 min after occlusion. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subsequently tested (30-42 days post-MCAO) and found to be deficient in skilled use of the forepaws (staircase test). The contralateral forepaw was most severely impaired, however, ARL 15896AR treatment prevented motor impairment in only the ipsilateral forepaw. Histopathological examination of cortical infarct size was unremarkable between treated and control rats. The findings indicate that ARL 15896AR exhibits neuroprotection in global and focal models of ischemia",

      "abstract": "Repetitive spreading depression (SD) waves, involving depolarization of neurons and astrocytes and up-regulation of glucose consumption, is thought to lower the threshold of neuronal death during and immediately after ischemia. Using rat models for SD and focal ischemia we investigated the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), the constitutive form, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible form of a key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis and the target enzymes for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Whereas COX-1 mRNA levels were undetectable and uninducible, COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were rapidly increased in the cortex, especially in layers 2 and 3 after SD and transient focal ischemia. The cortical induction was reduced by MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-receptor antagonist, and by dexamethasone and quinacrine, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibiting compounds. MK-801 acted by blocking SD whereas treatment with PLA2 inhibitors preserved the wave propagation. NBQX, an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate-receptor antagonist, did not affect the SD-induced COX-2 expression, whereas COX-inhibitors indomethacin and diclofenac, as well as a NO synthase-inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, tended to enhance the COX-2 mRNA expression. In addition, ischemia induced COX-2 expression in the hippocampal and perifocal striatal neurons and in endothelial cells. Thus, COX-2 is transiently induced after SD and focal ischemia by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-receptors and PLA2, most prominently in cortical neurons that are at a high risk to die after focal brain ischemia.",

We investigated the effects of metapramine on the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor complex, by determining whether this compound would interfere with the binding of [3H]N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]-3,4-piperidine ([3H]TCP) to rat cortical membranes in the presence of either glycine NMDA, or both. Metapramine in the micromolar range inhibited the binding of [3H]TCP in the presence of both NMDA and glycine (IC50 = 1.4 +/- 0.2 microM). That very similar affinities were observed when either NMDA or glycine was present suggests that metapramine exerted a direct action at the PCP site. The affinity of metapramine for this site was about 25 and 350 times lower than that of PCP and MK-801, respectively. Metapramine inhibited the NMDA-evoked increase in guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) levels of neonatal rat cerebellar slices (IC50 = 13 microM). These results suggest that metapramine is a low-affinity antagonist of the NMDA receptor complex channel. This paper discusses the potential application of metapramine to the treatment of diseases linked to excessive stimulation of glutamatergic NMDA receptors.",

Five patients that reported pain relief after acute intravenous injection of ketamine were included in this open prospective study. Ketamine was administered continuously in increasing doses using a portable infusion pump (CADD-PLUS, Pharmacia), and the treatment period for each infusion rate (0.05, 0.075, 0.10, or 0.15 mg/kg/h) was 7 days and nights. Relief of continuous pain, as evaluated daily by visual analogue scales, was observed at the infusion rate of 0.05 mg/kg/h, but was most marked during infusion of 0.15 mg/kg/h. All the patients reported that ketamine reduced the severity of continuous pain as well as reduced the severity and number of attacks of spontaneous pain. Changes in evoked pain (allodynia and wind-up-like pain) were recorded before change of infusion rate. Allodynia was maximally reduced 59-100% after 1 week infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/h, and wind-up-like pain was maximally reduced 60-100% after 1 week infusion of 0.15 mg/kg/h. Itching and painful indurations at the injection site was the most bothersome side-effect and for this reason 1 patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks. Other common side-effects were nausea, fatigue and dizziness. The present results show that continuous, spontaneous and evoked pain in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia is reduced by continuous s.c. infusion of ketamine, but is associated with intolerable side effects.",

      "abstract": "We studied the aggressive behaviour induced by repeated treatment with apomorphine, a dopamine agonist (0.5 mg/kg s.c. twice daily, 10 days), in rats. The first signs of defensive aggressiveness appeared on the third day of apomorphine treatment and were generally seen on the 7th day. Aggressiveness induced by a challenge dose of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) on the 11th day was antagonized by haloperidol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) and clozapine (10 mg/kg i.p.). An antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-gated channels, dizocilpine (MK-801), also blocked the aggressive behaviour at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg i.p. but caused ataxia. When dizocilpine (0.25 mg/kg i.p.) and apomorphine were coadministered for 10 days, aggressive behaviour did not develop. At 0.025 mg/kg i.p., dizocilpine even accelerated the appearance of apomorphine-induced aggressive behaviour, which manifested on the 3rd day in all rats. In a separate study, a 7-day treatment with dizocilpine (0.25-1 mg/kg i.p.) of rats, sensitized by a prior 10-day apomorphine treatment, did not reverse the established aggressive behaviour. The coadministration of apomorphine and cholecystokinin (CCK) -A or -B antagonists, devazepide or L-365,260 (0.01-2.5 mg/kg i.p.) respectively, neither affected development of apomorphine-induced aggressive behaviour nor intensity of aggressiveness in the sensitized rats. In binding studies neither density nor affinity of striatal dopamine D2 receptors was changed by acute or chronic apomorphine treatment. The number of [3H]pCCK-8 binding sites in the frontal cortex increased already after a single injection of apomorphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Cultures aged to equivalent Postnatal Day (EPD) 10-12, 15-17, and 23-26 were exposed to 50 microM KA or 50 microM NMDA and were analyzed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48 h, or 5 days after the initiation of the excitotoxin exposure. Neuronal injury was determined by: (1) propidium iodide (PI) uptake; (2) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; (3) morphological damage in hematoxylin and eosin (H/E) stained sections; (4) loss of Nissl stain. Changes in PI uptake and LDH release after KA or NMDA treatment indicated that there was a developmental shift towards increasing sensitivity to KA toxicity during in vitro development, whereas cultures of all ages were equally sensitive to NMDA toxicity. The profile of damage in H/E-stained sections after treatment with KA or NMDA indicated a transient phase of damaged morphology at 12 and 24 h that was not evident after 5 days. To determine whether the disappearance of morphological manifestations of neuronal damage 5 days after treatment was due to recovery of morphology or to neuronal death, neuronal loss in Nissl-stained sections was also quantified. KA treatment did not cause significant neuronal loss in any hippocampal region in EPD 10-12 cultures, indicating that the neurons were able to successfully recover from the damage demonstrated in H/E sections at 12 and 24 h in these cultures. KA treatment in mature cultures (EPD 23-26) and NMDA treatment in all cultures produced a marked loss of identifiable Nissl-stained neurons at 5 days, indicating neuronal death and disintegration. The results provide further support for the similarities between the organotypic hippocampal culture model and in vivo excitotoxic models and also confirm that excitotoxic neuronal injury can be reversible under some conditions.",

      "abstract": "A series of investigations has been made to analyze the receptive mechanisms for signals mediated by an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-sensitive subclass of brain excitatory amino acid receptors. Treatment of synaptic membranes with a low concentration of Triton X-100 induced a drastic disclosure of NMDA-sensitive [3H]glutamic acid binding without affecting the NMDA-insensitive populations. In these Triton-treated membranes, binding of [3H]glycine (Gly) was displaced by D-serine and D-alanine, but not by strychnine. These membrane preparations were also useful for detecting the binding of noncompetitive blockers to open NMDA channels in a manner highly sensitive to potentiation by NMDA, Gly and the polyamine spermidine. Comparative studies on the binding of agonist and antagonist ligands in different central regions suggested the possible heterogeneity of the NMDA, Gly and ionophore domains. By screening more than 1000 compounds, the binding of noncompetitive blockers was completely abolished by the addition of 6,7-dichloroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, which was revealed to be a selective antagonist for the Gly domain. Binding studies using the aforementioned radioligands gave rise to the idea that both reduced and oxidized glutathione could be endogenous agonists for the NMDA domain. An i.c.v. injection of NMDA led to a marked potentiation of DNA binding activities of particular transcription factors in a manner sensitive to antagonism by antagonists at the respective domains. These results suggest that NMDA signals are indeed transduced from cell surfaces into nuclei to express nuclear transcription factors through the NMDA-sensitive subclass that is a receptor ionophore complex consisting of at least 4 different constituents including the NMDA, Gly, polyamine and ionophore domains.",

In this study, we show that DAH is also active in vivo against Friend virus (FV-P)-induced erythroleukemia, and we report the effects of DAH in vivo an in vitro on FV-P target cells, i.e. the mature erythroid colony-forming cells (CFU-E). DAH treatment (2 g/kg/day) given for 95 days as a single daily i.p. injection to DBA/2 mice either 3 or 12 days following inoculation with a high dose (10(3) plaque-forming units) of FV-P resulted in a marked increase in the mean survival time of treated animals (212 and 191%, respectively). Since FV-P elicits spleen enlargement and polycythemia, we examined the effects of DAH on spleen size, spleen-nucleated cell number, and hematocrit, in normal and FV-P infected mice, at different times in the course of continuous DAH treatments. DAH treatment initiated 3 days after viral infection inhibits the virus-induced splenomegaly, with at day 26 p.i. 1.15 x 10(8) and 12.6 x 10(8) nucleated cells per spleen observed in DAH-treated mice and untreated mice respectively, whereas only 1.03 x 10(8) nucleated cells were observed in uninfected mice. Furthermore, DAH prevents virus-induced polycythemia: on day 26, an hematocrit of 39% was measured in DAH-treated mice as compared to 60% in untreated mice. DAH treatment initiated 12 days after viral infection reduces splenomegaly, the number of nucleated spleen cells and the hematocrit of infected mice. DAH treatment initiated 3 days after viral infection prevents the tremendous increase of CFU-E in the spleen of infected mice: on day 11, the spleen of infected mice contained 4.6 x 10(6) CFU-E, while the spleen of treated mice only contained 26 x 10(3) CFU-E, and on day 26 the spleen CFU-E numbers were 45.4 x 10(6) and 1.5 x 10(6) in untreated and treated infected mice, respectively. In control uninfected mice, DAH treatment induced a transient decrease in spleen CFU-E followed by a rebound phenomenon. In vitro, preincubation with DAH inhibits colony formation by FV-P infected CFU-E, at doses starting at 3 mM, as compared to uninfected CFU-E. These data show that DAH inhibits the expression of the retroviral infection, and appears to preferentially inhibit the proliferation of infected target cells (CFU-E) in vivo.",

To gain further insight into the early effects of DAH treatment on the early phase of Friend disease, we examined the effects of short DAH treatment on spleen size, hematocrit and viremia in FV-P-infected mice. DAH treatment initiated 3 days post infection (p.i.) inhibited splenomegaly, prevented virus-induced polycythemia, and reduced serum viremia.

Neonatal-6-OHDA lesioned animals were found more sensitive than control rats and female rats more sensitive than males to this MK-801-induced behavioral activation. CGS-19755, a competitive NMDA antagonist, also increased activity in neonatally lesioned animals. The increased activity level following MK-801 administration to neonatally lesioned rats was reduced, but not eliminated, by pretreatment with alpha-methyltyrosine, indicating that endogenous catecholamines were partially responsible for this action of MK-801. Furthermore, neither a D1- nor a D2-dopamine antagonist was totally effective alone in reducing MK-801-induced behavioral activation in the neonatally lesioned rats, but MK-801-induced activity was reduced to the level observed after alpha-methyltyrosine when both dopamine antagonists were administered in combination. In contrast to these results, alpha-methyltyrosine virtually eliminated the MK-801-induced activity in adult-lesioned rats. When individual behaviors induced by MK-801 were examined in neonatal-6-OHDA lesioned rats, MK-801 did not produce the same behaviors as L-dihydroxyphenylalanine or a D1- or D2-dopamine agonist. Whereas MK-801 had no major effect on most behaviors induced by specific D1- or D2-dopamine agonists, it blocked some behaviors produced after L-dihydroxyphenylalanine administration, including the self-injurious behavior. Repeated MK-801 treatment resulted in increasingly greater motor activity, but this was not related to increased D1-dopamine receptor sensitization. In support of a regional action of MK-801, MK-801 induced c-fos-like immunoreactivity in the cerebral cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens or striatum. The action of MK-801 to increase c-fos-like immunoreactivity in cerebral cortex was reduced, but not blocked, by SCH-23390. Additionally, MK-801 reduced, but did not eliminate, D1-dopamine agonist induced c-fos-like immunoreactivity in striatum. These data suggest that MK-801 not only can facilitate dopamine release within specific brain regions, but has behavioral and functional actions distinct from dopamine agonists.",

In addition, the sensitivity of both the basal and NMDA-induced increases in levels of these neurotransmitter substances to perfusion with tetrodotoxin (TTX: 10(-5) M) and a low Ca2+ concentration (0.1 mM) was studied. The results show that the local perfusion (10 min) with both the 10(-3) and 10(-4) M dose of NMDA increased striatal DA and GABA outflow, whereas only the (10(-3) M) dose of NMDA was associated with a small and delayed increase in extracellular Glu levels. The NMDA-induced effects were dose-dependently counteracted by simultaneous perfusion with MK-801 (10(-6) and 10(-5) M). Both the basal and NMDA (10(-3) M)-induced increase in extracellular striatal DA content was reduced in the presence of TTX and a low Ca2+ concentration, whereas both basal and NMDA-stimulated GABA levels were unaffected by these treatments. Both the basal and NMDA-stimulated Glu levels were enhanced following TTX treatment, whereas perfusion with a low Ca2+ concentration reduced basal Glu levels and enhanced and prolonged the NMDA-induced stimulation. These data support the view that NMDA receptor stimulation plays a role in the regulation of extracellular DA, GABA, and Glu levels in the dorso-lateral neostriatum and provide evidence for a differential effect of NMDA receptor stimulation on these three striatal neurotransmitter systems, possibly reflecting direct and indirect actions mediated via striatal NMDA receptors.",

We show here that amantadine inhibits, in a non-competitive way, the NMDA receptor-mediated stimulation of acetylcholine release from rat neostriatum in vitro in \"therapeutic\" (i.e., low micromolar) concentrations. This indicates that amantadine might exert its anti-Parkinsonian effect via blockade of NMDA receptors. Sustained stimulation of NMDA receptors induces so-called excitotoxicity. Recently, it was demonstrated that amantadine is able to inhibit NMDA induced cell death in a neuronal culture.

      "abstract": "Repetitive stimulation of small diameter primary afferent fibres produces a progressive increase in action potential discharge (windup) and a prolonged increase in the excitability of neurones in the spinal cord following the stimulus. Previous studies have demonstrated that windup is the consequence of the temporal summation of slow synaptic potentials and that the slow potentials and windup are reduced by pretreatment with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists. We have now examined whether primary afferent induced hypersensitivity states in flexor motoneurones are also dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors and whether windup is a possible trigger for the production of the central hypersensitivity. Both a non-competitive (MK-801) and a competitive (D-CPP) NMDA antagonist, at doses that did not modify the baseline reflex, reduced the facilitation of the flexor reflex produced by either brief electrical stimulation of the sural nerve (1 Hz for 20 sec at C-fibre strength), or by the cutaneous application of the chemical irritant mustard oil. These antagonists also prevented windup from occurring in the motoneurones. When the the MK-801 and the D-CPP were administered once a state of central facilitation had been induced by prior treatment with mustard oil, they returned the facilitated reflex to its pretreatment level. These results indicate that NMDA receptors are involved in the induction and maintenance of the central sensitization produced by high threshold primary afferent inputs. Because central sensitization is likely to contribute to the post-injury pain hypersensitivity states in man, these data have a bearing both on the potential role of NMDA antagonists for pre-emptive analgesia and for treating established pain states.",

Anticonvulsant and behavioral effects of these novel compounds were compared with those of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydroxy-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imin e] and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, one of the major drugs for treatment of partial and generalized seizures in humans. For comparative evaluation, the compounds were injected i.p. at the following doses: 1 to 10 mg/kg (CGP 37849 or CGP 39551), 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg (MK-801) and 20 to 40 mg/kg (carbamazepine), respectively. In contrast to carbamazepine, CGP 37849, CGP 39551 and MK-801 exerted only weak anticonvulsant effects in fully kindled rats and did not increase the focal seizure threshold. The weak anticonvulsant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats were associated with profound untoward behavioral effects. The behavioral syndrome induced by the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats was characterized by marked ataxia, hyperactivity and, in case of CGP 37849 and MK-801, stereotypies, such as head weaving. The low or absent effectiveness of the novel NMDA receptor antagonists against kindled seizures suggests that these compounds will not be clinically useful antiepileptics against partial and secondarily generalized seizures. Furthermore, in view of the recent clinical findings on psychotomimetic effects of MK-801 in epileptic patients, the similarities in the excitatory effects produced by CGP 39551, CGP 37849 and MK-801 in kindled rats may indicate that competitive NMDA receptor antagonists may also produce psychotomimetic effects in humans.",

      "abstract": "We have prepared a series of cis-4-(tetrazolylakyl)piperidine-2-carboxylic acids as potent and selective N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists. NMDA antagonists may prove to be useful therapeutic agents, for instance, as anticonvulsants, in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and in the prevention of neuronal damage that occurs during cerebral ischemia. The compounds prepared were evaluated in vitro in both receptor binding assays [( 3H]CGS-19755, [3H]AMPA, and [3H]kainic acid) and in a cortical-wedge preparation (versus NMDA, quisqualic acid, and kainic acid) to determine affinity, potency, and selectivity. The new amino acids were also evaluated in vivo for their ability to block NMDA-induced convulsions in neonatal rats and NMDA-induced lethality in mice. The most potent compound of this series, 15 (LY233053), selectively displaced [3H]CGS-19755 binding with an IC50 of 107 +/- 7 nM and selectively antagonized responses due to NMDA in a cortical-wedge preparation with an IC50 of 4.2 +/- 0.4 microM. Compound 15 blocked both NMDA-induced convulsions in neonatal rats (minimum effective dose (MED) = 20 mg/kg ip) and NMDA-induced lethality in mice (MED = 5 mg/kg ip). This is the first example of an NMDA receptor antagonist that incorporates a tetrazole moiety as an omega-acid bioisostere. These amino acid antagonists are also unique from their phosphonic acid counterparts in that they have a shorter duration of action in vivo. For the treatment of acute disorders such as stroke, where an NMDA antagonist would be administered parenterally, the shorter duration of action may be beneficial, e.g., allowing for better dosage control. The combination of potent NMDA receptor antagonism and a short duration of action may make these compounds useful therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders.",

LY233053 potently inhibited NMDA receptor binding to rat brain membranes as shown by the in vitro displacement of [3H] CGS19755 (IC50 = 107 +/- 7 nM). No appreciable affinity in [3H]alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) or [3H]kainate binding assays was observed (IC50 values greater than 10,000 nM). In vitro NMDA receptor antagonist activity was further demonstrated by selective inhibition of NMDA-induced depolarization in cortical wedges (IC50 = 4.2 +/- 0.4 microM vs. 40 microM NMDA). LY233053 was effective after in vivo systemic administration in a number of animal models. In neonatal rats, LY233053 selectively blocked NMDA-induced convulsions (ED50 = 14.5 mg/kg i.p.) with a relatively short duration of action (2-4 hr). In pigeons, LY233053 potently antagonized (ED50 = 1.3 mg/kg i.m.) the behavioral suppressant effects of 10 mg/kg of NMDA. However, a dose of 160 mg/kg, i.m., was required to produce phencyclidine-like catalepsy in pigeons. In mice, LY233053 protected against maximal electroshock-induced seizures at lower doses (ED50 = 19.9 mg/kg i.p.) than those that impaired horizontal screen performance (ED50 = 40.9 mg/kg i.p.). Cholinergic and GABAergic neuronal degenerations after striatal infusion of NMDA were prevented by single or multiple i.p. doses of LY233053. In summary, the antagonist activity of LY233053 after systemic administration demonstrates potential therapeutic value in conditions of neuronal cell loss due to NMDA receptor excitotoxicity. The relatively short duration of action of LY233053 may make this compound particularly advantageous as a neuroprotective agent in the treatment of acute conditions such as cerebral ischemia.",

      "abstract": "Recent reports from several laboratories have implicated the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate as a component in the neural regulation of sexual maturation. In the rat we have previously proposed that a hypothalamic opioid restraint mechanism may ultimately be overridden by maturation of an excitatory drive, culminating in first ovulation. We have now investigated whether glutamate may be the excitatory factor. Treatment of immature female rats with single, daily injections of two N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists--dextrorphan (18 mg/kg) and MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg)--beginning on the 27th postnatal day, significantly delayed the timing of vaginal opening (VO). Interestingly, treated rats reached VO in spite of continued antagonist treatment. The antagonist effect was reversed by preinjection of NMDA, suggesting that endogenous glutamate exerts its effect via an NMDA-subtype glutamate receptor. Injection of NMDA alone (15 mg/kg; once daily) produced a striking synchronization of VO such that all treated rats showed VO over a 24-hour period compared to a normal distribution of several days for control rats. In a model of first ovulation, i.e., rats induced to ovulate by pregnant mare serum, MK-801 (1 mg/kg) arrested treated rats at proestrus. This was readily reversible after discontinuing injections. A lower dose of MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg/day) was ineffective in delaying ovulation. In a second series of experiments we studied the consequences of a neonatal hypothalamic lesion which destroys glutamate-sensitive neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "To determine whether neuroexcitatory amino acids may play a role in generating intermittent hypothalamic GnRH release, the effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade on pulsatile LH secretion was examined in male rats. The ability of the NMDA receptor antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), to inhibit activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadotroph axis that follows peripheral administration of NMDA, was first established in intact rats. Subsequently, acutely castrated rats (n = 12) bearing venous catheters received four consecutive intravenous injections of AP5 (3.75 mg/injection/rat; approx. 13.6 mg/kg BW/injection) at 15-min intervals. Blood samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 1 h before and 2 h after initiation of AP5 treatment, and plasma LH concentrations were determined by RIA. For control purposes, norvaline, and amino acid structurally related to AP5, was administered to a second group of animals (n = 7) in a quantity (2.25 mg/injection/rat; approx. 8.2 mg/kg BW/injection) equimolar to that of the NMDA receptor antagonist. A third group of animals (n = 8) received only saline, the vehicle employed to inject AP5 and norvaline. AP5, but not norvaline, resulted in a marked suppression of pulsatile LH secretion. These findings suggest that neuroexcitatory amino acids acting at the NMDA receptor may play a physiological role in generating the intermittent mode of hypothalamic GnRH release.",
