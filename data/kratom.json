      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This case series reports the use of the 730-nm picosecond titanium-sapphire laser in the treatment of kratom-induced hyperpigmentation, a dermatological side effect associated with the use of Mitragyna speciosa, which remains poorly understood. METHODS: A series of patients with kratom-induced hyperpigmentation were treated using the 730-nm picosecond titanium-sapphire laser. Treatment outcomes were documented by assessing the degree of pigmentation improvement and noting the occurrence of any adverse effects or recurrence of hyperpigmentation. RESULTS: All patients showed significant improvement in the appearance of hyperpigmentation following treatment. No adverse effects or recurrence of hyperpigmentation were observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: This case series represents the first documented use of the 730-nm picosecond titanium-sapphire laser for treating kratom-induced hyperpigmentation. The laser's precision and minimal tissue disruption suggest it as a promising treatment option for this challenging dermatological side effect."

Emergency surgery was performed, and psychiatric evaluation revealed substance-induced psychosis. The patient's motivation for reconstructive penile surgery led to abstinence from the substance use and cooperation with treatment. Five months after hospitalization, successful penile reconstruction was completed. The patient remained abstinent and was engaged in regular psychiatric follow-ups, showing no signs of acute psychopathology. This case underscores the importance of using a multidisciplinary approach to manage severe self-harm behaviors, and highlights the critical role of patient motivation in achieving positive outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a plant native to Southeast Asia, is commonly used as a supplement for fatigue, pain relief, mood enhancement, and euphoria. Kratom extract exhibits diverse pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gastrointestinal effects, with studies showing its ability to modulate gut microbiota and stimulate beneficial bacteria growth. Given these properties, kratom treatment may produce significant effects in a rat model, warranting further investigation. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were administered kratom extract orally on a daily basis for 28 days. Fresh fecal samples were collected and analyzed for changes in gut microbiome composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. Hematological parameters and lipid profiles were also measured to evaluate any systemic effects. RESULTS: The administration of kratom extract did not significantly affect hematological parameters or lipid profiles. However, notable changes were observed in gut microbiota composition, with significant increases in specific bacteria such as Candidatus Stoquefichus and Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and a decrease in Corynebacterium. LEfSe and cladogram analyses corroborated the higher prevalence of Candidatus Stoquefichus, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and Erysipelatoclostridiaceae in the kratom treatment group compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Kratom extract significantly alters gut microbiome composition in rats, promoting beneficial bacteria while also elevating certain taxa associated with negative health outcomes. These mixed effects highlight the need for further research on the long-term implications of kratom use for gut health and its broader health consequences, as well as potential therapeutic applications.

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Thai herbal Kratom (THK), a traditional Thai remedy for muscle pain, is composed of six important medicinal plants and has been traditionally used as a compressed ball for muscle pain management. This study aimed to evaluate its phytochemical composition and biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic actions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phytochemical profile was investigated, and antioxidant activity was assessed using DPPH and ABTS scavenging assays. In vivo anti-inflammatory properties were examined using carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP)-induced ear edema, while anti-nociceptive activity was explored by the hot plate test and acetic acid-induced writhing test. RESULTS: The ethanolic extract of THK was found to contain several potent phytochemicals, including 4-hydroxycoumarin, curcumin, mitragynine, aloin A, and limonin. HPLC analysis revealed a high concentration of mitragynine in the extract, with a value of 10.76 ± 0.50 mg/L. The extract demonstrated an antioxidant activity in DPPH and ABTS scavenging assays, with IC50 value of 275.15 ± 1.78 and 256.49 ± 6.66 μg/mL, respectively. Oral administration of THK at dose of 125-500 mg/kg exhibited promising anti-inflammatory activity in a dose-dependent manner by reducing carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. Topical application of THK (1-2 mg/ear) was shown to highly inhibit ear swelling at 120 min after EEP-induced inflammation, with values of 83%, which was more potent activity than indomethacin treatment at 30, 60, and 120 min. Furthermore, THK at 125 mg/kg significantly reduced pain response in both the hot plate and acetic acid-induced writhing tests. CONCLUSION: This study found that the ethanolic extract of THK possesses significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in vivo, supporting its traditional use for muscle pain management.",

      "abstract": "Background: Kratom is a plant with alkaloids acting at opioid, serotonergic, adrenergic, and other receptors. Consumers report numerous use motivations.Objectives: To distinguish subgroups of kratom consumers by kratom-use motivations using latent-class analysis.Methods: From July to November 2022, we utilized convenience sampling and surveyed regular kratom consumers (n = 395, 38.1 years (SD 11.2), 54.9% male, 81.3% White) regarding demographics, lifetime and past-year substance use and preferences, substance use disorder history, healthcare barriers, kratom-use motivations, and general health. We used latent-class analysis to identify subgroups by use motivation and calculated conditional probabilities (Pc) for variables in each class.Results: A four-class model best fit our data. The largest class (32.4%) was characterized by the use of kratom for self-treatment of chronic pain (Pc = .91). The smallest class (19.2%) also reported using kratom for self-treatment, but usually as a long-term replacement for other substances (Pc = .75). The other two classes (24.8% and 23.5%) reported using kratom for management of anxiety (Pc = .87-.95) and depressive symptoms (Pc = .61-.89) and for recreation (Pc = .56- .86). These were distinguished from one another by probability of at least moderate kratom use disorder (Pc = .17 vs. .53), with greater probability observed in the class with greater anxiety (Pc = .13 vs. .50) and depressive (Pc = .34 vs. .82) symptom severity and more likely recreational use motivation (Pc = .56 vs. .86).Conclusion: Kratom consumers can be classified by their use motivations. As with other psychoactive substances, the range of motivations is consistent with the range of likely effects. It is not yet clear whether some motivations might indicate the risk of problems.",

      "abstract": "Recently in the USA, kratom consumers increasingly report use of the plant for self-treatment of mood ailments, the lack of energy, chronic pain, and opioid withdrawal and dependence. Several alkaloids are present in kratom leaves, but limited data are available on their pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, except for mitragynine. To support clinical studies, a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for the simultaneous quantification of 11 kratom alkaloids in human plasma was developed and validated. For calibration standards and quality control samples, human plasma was fortified with alkaloids at varying concentrations, and 200 µL were extracted employing a simple one-step protein precipitation procedure. The extracts were analyzed using LC-MS/MS including electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The lower limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/mL, and the upper limit of quantification was 400 ng/mL for all analytes. Inter-day analytical accuracy and imprecision ranged from 98.4 to 113% of nominal and from 3.9 to 14.7% (coefficient of variance), respectively. The analysis of plasma samples collected during a clinical trial administering capsules containing kratom leaf extract showed that most samples had quantifiable concentrations of mitragynine, 7-OH-mitragynine, speciogynine, speciociliatine, and paynantheine and that mitragynine, speciogynine, and speciociliatine accumulated in human plasma after daily administration over 15 days. An LC-MS/MS assay for the specific quantification of kratom alkaloids including mitragynine and its main metabolites was developed and successfully validated in human plasma. Human plasma samples collected following multiple oral administrations of a controlled Kratom extract documented accumulation of kratom alkaloids over 15 days.",

      "abstract": "Despite the strict kratom regulation in some regions, the demand for kratom products is still increasing worldwide. Kratom products are commonly consumed for their pain-relieving effect or as a self-treatment for opioid use disorder. Kratom is also taken as a recreational drug among youth and adults. Since substance abuse can cause cognitive impairment, many studies investigated the effects of kratom on cognition. The interaction of some kratom alkaloids with various receptors such as opioid, serotonergic, and adrenergic receptors further sparks the interest to investigate the effects of kratom on cognitive function. Hence, this review aims to provide an overview of the effects of kratom on cognitive behaviours and their underlying changes in neurobiological mechanisms. In conclusion, kratom, particularly its main alkaloid, mitragynine may adversely affect cognitive performances that may be attributed to the disruption in synaptic plasticity, brain activity as well as various proteins involved in synaptic transmission. The impact of kratom on cognitive functions could also shed light on its safety profile, which is essential for the therapeutic development of kratom, including its potential use in opioid substitution therapy.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) accounts for nearly 4.7% of all deaths and imposes a huge economic burden on society. Despite the magnitude of the problem, only a few Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved drugs are currently available for AUD treatment. Despite being efficacious, these drugs are not without problems, adverse effects being a major issue. That combined with medication adherence and compliance problems, the discovery of new drugs is imperative. Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) alkaloids and some of their semisynthetic derivatives reduce alcohol intake and alcohol-induced withdrawal symptoms in animal models. These compounds act as G-protein-biased ligands at the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors, and their effect in reducing alcohol intake is mediated through the δ-opioid receptor. This article provides a critical overview of recent preclinical studies involving kratom alkaloids for AUD treatment, with a particular focus on the pharmacology and medicinal chemistry of these alkaloids. FDA/EMA approved drugs, repurposed drugs, and plant-based compounds for the treatment of AUD are briefly mentioned. Finally, important caveats and future research directions on this topic are discussed.",

Kratom is cardiotoxic with several case reports linking its use to QTc prolongation and ventricular dysrhythmias; however, there exist few reports of kratom-induced Brugada syndrome. A 36-year-old male with a past medical history inclusive of polysubstance abuse, bipolar disorder, and seizure disorder presented to the emergency department for chest pain. The patient reported a three-week history of lightheadedness when standing, oftentimes accompanied by palpitations and syncope. The patient was prescribed lamotrigine but reported non-adherence for more than three months due to a lack of insurance. The patient self-administered high-dose (~100 grams/day) white vein kratom daily for the last three years for symptoms of opioid withdrawal and alcohol cravings. He denied a family history of sudden cardiac death. The initial electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated coved ST segments followed by a negative T wave in leads V1 and V2 consistent with a type 1 Brugada pattern. Pacer pads were applied, and cardiology and electrophysiology were consulted. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit on telemetry. Serial EKGs returned to normal sinus rhythm, and an inpatient flecainide challenge was negative, making Brugada syndrome secondary to chronic high-dose kratom use the most likely diagnosis. We presented a case of type 1 Brugada syndrome induced by chronic high-dose kratom use. While the clinical management of kratom toxicity is mostly supportive, physicians should consider potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmias including Brugada syndrome."

      "abstract": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is increasingly used in the US for self-management of pain, despite limited research on its efficacy and safety. To better understand how and why people use kratom for pain self-management, we analyzed baseline survey data (N = 395) and 15-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data (N = 357) from kratom consumers across the US. Although we recruited participants based on their kratom use, not on whether they used it for pain management, nearly half (49.1 %) met criteria for chronic pain, with many reporting substantial pain relief and high effectiveness of kratom in managing pain. A majority (69.2 %) reported difficulties in obtaining adequate pain treatment, and most indicated that these challenges impacted their decision to try kratom. Most participants did not report concerns about overuse or significant side effects. EMA data showed that, regardless of chronic-pain status, pain relief was the most frequently endorsed primary motivation for daily kratom use. There were no significant association between daily pain levels and kratom use frequency, and no difference in the daily kratom use between those with vs. without chronic pain. Recent kratom use was associated with lower current pain levels. Stronger subjective effects of kratom were associated with lower pain levels. This effect was significantly moderated by chronic-pain status: those with chronic pain showed a stronger link between subjective kratom effects and pain reduction. These findings underscore the urgent need for systematic, rigorous research on long-term implications, efficacy, and safety of kratom in pain management to guide informed clinical practices and regulatory policies. PERSPECTIVE: This study reveals that chronic pain is common among kratom consumers, who frequently use it for pain self-management and report significant relief, as shown by ecological momentary assessment. There is an urgent need for research into kratom's safety, efficacy, and mechanisms to guide clinical practice and inform policies.",

Decoction derived from the kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) leaf has been used as a METH substitute in Southeast Asia. Given its perceived benefit, we investigated the relationship between kratom use and aggression in a treatment sample of METH users with and without kratom use history. Four hundred and three male METH users participated in this cross-sectional study. A semi-structured questionnaire and several objective clinical measures were administered. Results indicate that there were no significant differences in aggression and its dimensions between METH users with and without kratom use history. However, two distinct Clusters (1 and 2) of METH users with kratom use history were studied. Users in Cluster 1 were characterized by a higher quantity and frequency of daily kratom use, longer duration of kratom use, and use of kratom at a younger age. Users in Cluster 2 exhibited the opposite characteristics. Kratom dependence and the first age of kratom use were identified as risk factors for aggression in Cluster 1. The frequency of daily kratom use appeared as a protective factor against aggression in Cluster 2. The results offer partial support to the instrumental kratom use concept; lower frequency (1 to 3 times) of kratom use may potentially minimize aggression in METH users presenting with mild to moderate kratom dependence."

This case series highlights the need for diverse treatment approaches tailored to the individual motivations for kratom consumption. Three cases are presented: one involving the progression from kratom use for energy to opioid-driven use with subsequent challenges in detoxification and transition to naltrexone necessitating buprenorphine low-dose induction for maintenance; another detailing successful inpatient detoxification using methadone and symptom-driven clonidine, followed by successful maintenance treatment with naltrexone; and a final case involving kratom consumption for pain and anxiety self-management by an individual without a history of addictive disorders, without meeting KUD criteria. These cases underscore the complexity of managing individuals who consume kratom as well as those who develop dependence, emphasizing the need for individualized treatment approaches considering various factors such as motivation for use, psychiatric comorbidities, and response to interventions."

      "abstract": "Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) from Mitragyna speciosa (\"kratom\"), such as mitragynine and speciogynine, are promising novel scaffolds for opioid receptor ligands for treatment of pain, addiction, and depression. While kratom leaves have been used for centuries in South-East Asia as stimulant and pain management substance, the biosynthetic pathway of these psychoactives have only recently been partially elucidated. Here, we demonstrate the de novo production of mitragynine and speciogynine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through the reconstruction of a five-step synthetic pathway from common MIA precursor strictosidine comprising fungal tryptamine 4-monooxygenase to bypass an unknown kratom hydroxylase. Upon optimizing cultivation conditions, a titer of ∼290 μg/L kratom MIAs from glucose was achieved. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of lead production strains led to the identification of numerous shunt products derived from the activity of strictosidine synthase (STR) and dihydrocorynantheine synthase (DCS), highlighting them as candidates for enzyme engineering to further improve kratom MIAs production in yeast. Finally, by feeding fluorinated tryptamine and expressing a human tailoring enzyme, we further demonstrate production of fluorinated and hydroxylated mitragynine derivatives with potential applications in drug discovery campaigns. Altogether, this study introduces a yeast cell factory platform for the biomanufacturing of complex natural and new-to-nature kratom MIAs derivatives with therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kratom is federally unregulated and is marketed as an opioid alternative despite limited evidence and known negative effects. Disparities in associations between opioid and kratom use may be partly attributed to race/ethnicity and sexual orientation given differences in marketing, use motives, and prescriber practices. METHODS: Data: 2021 nationally representative National Survey on Drug Use and Health among individuals aged 18 + . We used weighted logistic regression analyses to assess race/ethnicity and sexual orientation as moderators of associations between past-year opioid (1) use (total sample, n = 44,877) and (2) misuse and use disorder (among those with past-year opioid use, n = 10,398) and the outcome of kratom use (lifetime, past year). RESULTS: 26.76% reported past-year opioid use, and among those, 12.20% and 7.54% reported past-year opioid misuse and use disorder, respectively; 1.72% and 0.67% had lifetime and past-year kratom use, respectively. Opioid use was positively associated with lifetime (aOR = 2.69, 95%CI = 1.98, 3.66) and past-year (aOR = 3.84, 95%CI = 2.50, 5.92) kratom use; associations among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic (vs. non-Hispanic White) participants were weaker (p < 0.01). Among participants reporting past-year opioid use, misuse and use disorder were positively associated with lifetime (aORmisuse = 2.46, 95%CI = 1.60, 3.78; aORuse disorder = 5.58, 95%CI = 2.82, 11.04) and past-year (aORmisuse = 2.40, 95%CI = 1.26, 4.59; aORuse disorder = 3.08, 95%CI = 1.48, 6.41) kratom use; among bisexual (vs. heterosexual) participants, opioid use disorder was associated with a lower probability of lifetime kratom use (p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: We observed positive associations between opioid and kratom use, with potential disparities among certain racial/ethnic and sexual orientation groups. Research should examine the mechanisms contributing to these differences to inform prevention and intervention efforts."

Similarities and differences between kratom use disorder (KUD) and other SUDs are explored, along with assessment, diagnostic, and therapeutic recommendations for KUD. RECENT FINDINGS: Literature reports of \"kratom addiction\" or KUD rarely specify the criteria by which patients were diagnosed. Individuals meeting DSM-5 KUD criteria typically do so via tolerance and withdrawal, using more than intended, and craving, not functional or ​psychosocial disruption, which occur rarely. Most clinicians who use medication to treat patients with isolated KUD select buprenorphine formulations, although there are no controlled studies showing that buprenorphine is safe or efficacious in this patient population. Diagnosis and treatment decisions for KUD should be systematic. We propose an algorithm that takes into consideration whether KUD occurs with comorbid opioid use disorder.",

      "abstract": "Used in Southeast Asia for generations, kratom gained popularity in the United States and elsewhere over the past several decades. Derived from Mitragyna speciosa, kratom preparations including leaves, teas, powders, capsules, and extracts may yield stimulant, analgesic, and opioid-like effects that occur dose-dependently based on concentrations of kratom's key alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Such effects are responsible for kratom's potential as a reduced-harm alternative to opiates and as a withdrawal treatment. But these properties are also associated with tolerance development and addictive potential. Given mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine activity on cytochrome P450 isoforms and opioid receptors, adverse effects among polysubstance users are a concern. Current literature on the toxicology of kratom is reviewed, including product alkaloid concentrations, in vitro and in vivo data, epidemiological evidence, and human case data. The potential harms and benefits of kratom products are discussed within an exposure assessment framework, and recommendations for industry are presented. Current evidence indicates that kratom may have therapeutic potential in some persons and that products present few risks with typical, non-polysubstance use. However, few studies identified alkaloid doses at which adverse effects were expected in humans or animals. Such research is needed to inform future assessments of kratom's risks and benefits.",

The advancement of globalization is making kratom increasingly more available in the western world, where it is becoming increasingly more used. OBJECTIVE: The current research on kratom and its ingredients is presented. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An overview of the use and effects of kratom is exemplary given on the basis of reports. The instrumentalization of the drug and its consequences up to the development of addiction are discussed. RESULTS: Consumption is accompanied by several instrumentalizeable effects so that kratom is used as a therapeutic substance in the self-management of pain, anxiety and depression as well as other substance addictions. Another benefit comes from the performance-enhancing effects on physical work and in a social context. Consumption is usually well controlled, rarely escalates and has few and mostly mild aversive side effects. The danger arises from consumption particularly when there is an escalation of the dose and from mixed consumption with other psychoactive substances. The main alkaloid mitragynine and the more potent 7‑hydroxy-mitragynine are considered mainly responsible for the effect. Both have a complex pharmacology that involves partial µ‑opioid receptor agonism. DISCUSSION: Epidemiological, clinical and neurochemical studies have shown that kratom only has a limited addictive drug profile, which might suggest a medical use as a remedy or substitute in addiction treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: \"Kratom\" refers to an array of bioactive products derived from Mitragyna speciosa, a tree indigenous to Southeast Asia. Most kratom consumers report analgesic and stimulatory effects, and common reasons for use are to address mental and physical health needs, manage pain, and to reduce use of other substances. Natural-history studies and survey studies suggest that many kratom consumers perceive benefits from those uses, but such studies are unlikely to capture the full range of kratom-use experiences. METHODS: We collected text data from Reddit posts from 2020-2022 to qualitatively examine conceptualizations, motivations, effects, and consequences associated with kratom use among people posting to social media. Reddit posts mentioning kratom were studied using template thematic analysis, which included collecting descriptions of kratom product types and use practices. Network analyses of coded themes was performed to examine independent relationships among themes, and between themes and product types. RESULTS: Codes were applied to 329 of the 370 posts that comprised the final sample; 134 posts contained kratom product descriptions. As Reddit accounts were functionally anonymous, demographic estimates were untenable. Themes included kratom physical dependence (tolerance, withdrawal, or use to avoid withdrawal), perceived addiction (net detrimental effects on functioning), and quitting. Extract products were positively associated with reports of perceived addiction, dependence, and experiences of quitting kratom. Many used kratom for energy and self-treatment of pain, fatigue, and problems associated with opioid and alcohol; they perceived these uses as effective. Consumers expressed frustrations about product inconsistencies and lack of product information. CONCLUSION: As in previous studies, kratom was deemed helpful for some and a hindrance to others, but we also found evidence of notable negative experiences with kratom products that have not been well documented in surveys. Daily kratom use may produce mild-moderate physical dependence, with greater severity being possibly more common with concentrated extracts; however, there are currently no human laboratory studies of concentrated kratom extracts. Such studies, and detailed kratom product information, are needed to help inform consumer decision-making."

      "abstract": "Substance use disorders contribute to considerable U.S. morbidity and mortality. While effective pharmacotherapy options are available to treat opioid and alcohol use disorders, for a variety of reasons, many patients lack access to treatment or may be reluctant to seek care due to concerns such as perceived stigma or a current lack of desire to completely curtail their substance use. Furthermore, treatment options are limited for patients with stimulant or polysubstance use disorders. Thus, there is considerable need to expand the substance use disorder harm reduction armamentarium. Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) is an herbal substance that can produce both opioid and stimulant-like effects, and its use in the US is growing. Though there are concerns regarding adverse effects, dependence risk, and limited regulation of its manufacturing and sale, the pharmacology of kratom and early preclinical studies suggest a potential role as a harm reduction agent for various substance use disorders, and it has historically been used in Southeast Asia for such purposes. The goal of this review is to describe kratom's history of use, pharmacology, and early pre-clinical and observational research regarding its therapeutic potential in opioid use disorder, as well as alcohol, stimulant, and polysubstance use disorders, while also highlighting current concerns around its use, existing gaps in the literature, and directions for future research.",

Past Web-based research has attempted to determine patterns and trends of use, but generalizability to underserved populations is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize behavior related to kratom, attitudes toward kratom, and knowledge of kratom in a rural, underserved population. METHODS: We developed, refined, and administered a cross-sectional, 36-item survey to examine use, attitudes, and knowledge of kratom. We recruited participants and administered the survey alongside medical office appointments between January and April 2023. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A convenient sample of 186 patients (of the 907-patient clinic panel) were invited to participate and 150 returned the survey. Most patients were female (52.0%) and white (86.6%), and approximately half had an income below the federal poverty level (48.5%). Seventeen participants reported previous experience with kratom use, with one actively using kratom. The most commonly reported reasons for use were pain (47.1%) and mental health (41.2%). Kratom knowledge was low regardless of kratom use history, with most respondents correctly answering between 1 and 3 questions (n = 71 of 86; 82.3%) of the 5 knowledge-focused items. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that although active kratom use is uncommon in this Oregon population, 1 in 10 surveyed had used kratom. Regardless of past use, respondents had limited knowledge of kratom. Future research should focus on understanding trends in kratom use behaviors in underserved populations, addressing patient knowledge gaps, and evaluating patient safety and health equity implications.",

However, its long-term usage could result in side effects, such as cardiomyopathy, chronic heart failure, neurotoxicity and cancer cell resistance. In this study, we reported the sensitivity enhancement of A549 human lung cancer cells on doxorubicin at a low dose (0.1 ppm) in combination with 10-60 ppm of crude and alkaloid extracts derived from the leaves of Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.) Havil. Rubiaceae). A549 cancer cell lines were insensitive to the crude extract containing low mitragynine (MG) (4-5%), while these cells were moderately inhibited by the alkaloid extract containing 40-45% MG (IC50 of 48-55 ppm). The alkaloid extract was found to inhibit A549 cancer cells via apoptosis as suggested by the higher relative fluorescence intensity with Annexin compared to that in propidium iodide (PI), i.e., a positive Annexin and a negative PI. The combination of crude extract and doxorubicin sensitized A549 cancer cells to doxorubicin by 1.3 to 2.4 times, while the combination with the alkaloid induced a 2.6- to 3.4-fold increase in sensitivity. The calculated combination index (CI) for doxorubicin with the crude and alkaloid extracts was 0.6 and 0.3, respectively, showing potential synergistic combinations to reduce the level of dosage of doxorubicin used in chemotherapy. In addition, the synergistic enhancement effect of crude extract on the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin provides insights into the plausibility of non-alkaloids to influence the biological activities of Kratom.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Kratom is a preparation from Mitragyna speciosa, which is used as a natural drug preparation for many purposes around the world. However, an overdose of Kratom may cause addiction-like problems including aversive withdrawal states resulting in cognitive impairments via unknown mechanisms. Its main psychoactive alkaloid is mitragynine, showing opioid-like properties. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Here, we analysed the neuropharmacological effects of mitragynine compared with morphine withdrawal in rats and searched for a pharmacological treatment option that may reverse the occurring cognitive deficits that usually aggravate withdrawal. KEY RESULTS: We found that withdrawal from 14-day mitragynine (1-10 mg·kg-1·day-1) treatment caused dose-dependent behavioural withdrawal signs resembling those of morphine (5 mg·kg-1·day-1) withdrawal. However, mitragynine (5 and 10 mg·kg-1·day-1) withdrawal also induced impairments in a passive avoidance task. Mitragynine withdrawal not only reduced hippocampal field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitudes in basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) but also reduced epigenetic markers, such as histone H3K9 and H4K12 expression. At the same time, it up-regulates HDAC2 expression. Targeting the epigenetic adaptations with the HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, reversed the effects of mitragynine withdrawal on epigenetic dysregulation, hippocampal input/output curves, paired-pulse facilitation, LTP and attenuated the cognitive deficit. However, SAHA amplified the effects of morphine withdrawal. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The data from this work show that changes in histone expression and downstream hippocampal plasticity may explain mitragynine, but not morphine, withdrawal behaviours and cognitive impairments. Thus, it may provide a new treatment approach for aversive Kratom/mitragynine withdrawal and addiction.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Despite kratom impacting neurobiological systems involved in psychiatric disorders, little is known about the prevalence of use among patients with severe psychopathologies. Here, we investigated the prevalence of kratom use, motives for use, and the clinical associations among inpatients with severe psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A total of 578 patients, aged 18 to 65, were evaluated by New Hampshire Hospital's Addiction Services from January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2022. The study collected demographic information and used chi-square tests, multivariable logistic regression, and subgroup analyses with 95% confidence intervals to examine trends among kratom users. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also conducted. All statistical tests were performed using IBM SPSS Version 28.0.1. RESULTS: Of the patients assessed, 2.2% (n = 13) reported using kratom. The reasons for kratom use were managing withdrawal symptoms (15.4%), maintaining sobriety and reducing cravings for opioids (53.8%), improving focus and concentration (30.8%), alleviating low moods (38.5%), and managing pain (15.4%). Compared to non-kratom users, the only factor with a fair to good association with kratom use is postsecondary education (Area Under Curve, AUC = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of kratom use among patients with serious mental illness at our site aligns with that reported in the general population. Users often cite self-management of cravings and sobriety from opioids, as well as treatment of low mood states, as motivations for consumption. While observations suggest a possible association between kratom use and individuals with post-secondary education, multiple substance use, and experience of substance-induced psychosis or mood disorders, it is essential to interpret these links cautiously until further rigorous studies are carried out to substantiate these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While FDA-approved treatments exist for opioid use disorder, none are available for stimulant use disorder. Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), an unregulated plant-derived substance with known opioid- and stimulant-like effects, has been used to self-treat opioid use disorder; however, its use in relation to stimulant use disorder has not been described. OBJECTIVE: To understand whether and how individuals use kratom to self-treat stimulant use disorder. METHODS: Using a commercially available social listening platform, 3,820 publicly available social media posts published between January 1, 2020, and June 21, 2021, were reviewed for relevance to kratom and stimulant discontinuation. Manual qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on relevant data. RESULTS: Among the 398 relevant posts that discussed using kratom to discontinue stimulants, motivations and methods varied considerably. Posts predominantly identified benefits but also negative outcomes of kratom use. Some justified it as necessary despite consequences, while others reported a desire to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some awareness that kratom is used to self-treat opioid use disorder, its use to treat stimulant use disorder is more novel. In the absence of approved treatments, kratom was viewed as a natural and safe way to quit stimulants. Despite some reported success, this study shows self-treatment may pose significant risks, including kratom addiction and physical dependence. Healthcare practitioners, researchers, and public health professionals may benefit from understanding motivations for kratom use, associated benefits and risks, and the importance of discussing kratom use with patients/clients who have stimulant use disorder.",

Kratom is well known as a drug that can serve as a less toxic and less-addictive pain-relieving substitute for opium, as well as a therapy for hypertension, cough, and diarrhea. Its major alkaloid, mitragynine, also deserves concern. However, most people use kratom as a psychological stimulant, which carries a risk of addiction associated with negative social and health impacts. This paper reviews basic facts about kratom and its potential use in pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacokinetics of its major alkaloid mitragynine (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 87).

The active component mitragynine acts in high dose as a mu-opioid agonist. It is misconceived to be a safe alternative to conventional opioid drugs for the treatment of chronic pain. Therefore, maternal use of Kratom is not without risks as opioid use during pregnancy is associated with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case report we describe a term neonate with severe NAS as a result of daily Kratom ingestion by the mother during pregnancy. Presence of mitragynine was confirmed in serum of the neonate. NAS was successfully treated with oral phenobarbital. CONCLUSION: Maternal Kratom use during pregnancy can cause severe NAS via in utero exposure. Physicians should be aware of the possible maternal use of Kratom in the case of a neonate with NAS. NAS as a result of maternal Kratom use can be effectively treated with oral phenobarbital.",

      "abstract": "Kratom, (Mitragyna Speciosa Korth.) is a plant indigenous to Southeast Asia whose leaves are cultivated for a variety of medicinal purposes and mostly consumed as powders or tea in the United States. Kratom use has surged in popularity with the lay public and is currently being investigated for possible therapeutic benefits including as a treatment for opioid withdrawal due to the pharmacologic effects of its indole alkaloids. A wide array of psychoactive compounds are found in kratom, with mitragynine being the most abundant alkaloid. The drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of mitragynine and related alkaloids have been evaluated for effects on the major cytochrome P450s (CYPs) via in vitro assays and limited clinical investigations. However, no thorough assessment of their potential to inhibit the major hepatic hydrolase, carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), exists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro inhibitory potential of kratom extracts and its individual major alkaloids using an established CES1 assay and incubation system. Three separate kratom extracts and the major kratom alkaloids mitragynine, speciogynine, speciociliatine, paynantheine, and corynantheidine displayed a concentration-dependent reversible inhibition of CES1. The experimental Ki values were determined as follows for mitragynine, speciociliatine, paynantheine, and corynantheidine: 20.6, 8.6, 26.1, and 12.5 μM respectively. Speciociliatine, paynantheine, and corynantheidine were all determined to be mixed-type reversible inhibitors of CES1, while mitragynine was a purely competitive inhibitor. Based on available pharmacokinetic data, determined Ki values, and a physiologically based inhibition screen mimicking alkaloid exposures in humans, a DDI mediated via CES1 inhibition appears unlikely across a spectrum of doses (i.e., 2-20g per dose). However, further clinical studies need to be conducted to exclude the possibility of a DDI at higher and extreme doses of kratom and those who are chronic users.",

It contains opioid and stimulant properties and is used for relaxation as well as for weaning off opioid addictions. While a few adverse effects of kratom have been already reported, mainly with concerns around its toxicity, very little is known about it. We report a case of a female in her 40s presenting with signs of hypoxia reversed with naloxone administration, initially suspected to be a case of opioid overdose. Upon becoming alert and oriented, the patient and her husband reported that she consumed a large amount of kratom bought from the local gas station, and he later noticed that her lips were turning blue and she was becoming increasingly altered. Her urine toxicology was noted to be negative for opioids or any other substance use. The patient survived this accidental overdose due to the quick action of her husband, who rushed her to the emergency department (ED) upon realizing she appeared altered and very ill. It is important for emergency medicine practitioners to be aware of kratom overdose as a possible item on the differential diagnosis. This paper focuses on kratom overdose presentation and treatment."

Mitragynine content was quantified in kratom decoction and used as a marker to determine the concentration. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were orally treated with vehicle or kratom decoction (10, 50 or 150 mg/kg) and two satellite groups were treated with vehicle and kratom decoction (150 mg/kg). Blood and organs were collected for hematology, biochemical and histopathology analysis at the end of treatment. No mortality was found after 28 days of treatment and no significant changes in body weight and hematology profile, except for low platelet count. High amounts of uric acid, AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase were found in the biochemical analysis. Histological investigation of the heart and lungs detected no alterations except for the kidney, liver and brain tissues. In conclusion, repeated administration of kratom decoction provided some evidence of toxicity in the kidney and liver with no occurrence of mortality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kratom has been used for different reasons such as pain, opioid withdrawal, and relaxation. Kratom can cause dependence and overdose, and it's classified under 'drugs of concern' by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Despite these concerns, kratom is legal in most of the United States and many countries around the world with easy accessibility. Literature searches reveal recommendations to use buprenorphine (or buprenorphine-naloxone), which are medications to treat opioid use disorder, in order to treat patients with kratom use disorder; however, there are no formal guidelines available. Buprenorphine (or buprenorphine-naloxone) induction is recommended to be conducted under observation (i.e. in the clinic) in the United States, but COVID-19 has resulted in shifts toward telehealth. OBJECTIVES: Describe case series of successful management of kratom use disorder using telehealth followed by unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone home induction and highlight implications for future management, including maintenance dosage and induction method. METHODS: We present 2 very similar kratom use disorder patients who reported taking 35 g of kratom per day who underwent unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone home induction. RESULTS: Both were seen via telehealth initially. They reported no adverse effects before, during, or after the unobserved home induction on buprenorphine-naloxone but stabilized on significantly different dosages. CONCLUSION: Telehealth followed by unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone induction at home may be an alternative to traditional buprenorphine-naloxone induction where treatment accessibility is limited. In addition to daily doses of kratom use, other factors, such as duration of kratom use and individual psychological factors may determine the most comfortable dose of buprenorphine-naloxone.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Chronic neuropathic pain is as a severe detriment to overall quality of life for millions of Americans. Current pharmacological treatment options for chronic neuropathic pain are generally limited in efficacy and may pose serious adverse effects such as risk of abuse, nausea, dizziness, and cardiovascular events. Therefore, many individuals have resorted to methods of pharmacological self-treatment. This narrative review summarizes the existing literature on the utilization of two novel approaches for the treatment of chronic pain, cannabinoid constituents of Cannabis sativa and alkaloid constituents of Mitragyna speciosa (kratom), and speculates on the potential therapeutic benefits of co-administration of these two classes of compounds. Methods: We conducted a narrative review summarizing the primary motivations for use of both kratom and cannabis products based on epidemiological data and summarize the pre-clinical evidence supporting the application of both kratom alkaloids and cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain. Data collection was performed using the PubMed electronic database. The following word combinations were used: kratom and cannabis, kratom and pain, cannabis and pain, kratom and chronic pain, and cannabis and chronic pain. Results: Epidemiological evidence reports that the self-treatment of pain is a primary motivator for use of both kratom and cannabinoid products among adult Americans. Further evidence shows that use of cannabinoid products may precede kratom use, and that a subset of individuals concurrently uses both kratom and cannabinoid products. Despite its growing popularity as a form of self-treatment of pain, there remains an immense gap in knowledge of the therapeutic efficacy of kratom alkaloids for chronic pain in comparison to that of cannabis-based products, with only three pre-clinical studies having been conducted to date. Conclusion: There is sufficient epidemiological evidence to suggest that both kratom and cannabis products are used to self-treat pain, and that some individuals actively use both drugs, which may produce potential additive or synergistic therapeutic benefits that have not yet been characterized. Given the lack of pre-clinical investigation into the potential therapeutic benefits of kratom alkaloids against forms of chronic pain, further research is warranted to better understand its application as a treatment alternative.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Mitragynine (MG) is an alkaloid found in Mitragyna speciosa (kratom), a plant used to self-treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal and pain. Kratom products are commonly used in combination with cannabis, with the self-treatment of pain being a primary motivator of use. Both cannabinoids and kratom alkaloids have been characterized to alleviate symptoms in preclinical models of neuropathic pain such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). However, the potential involvement of cannabinoid mechanisms in MG's efficacy in a rodent model of CIPN have yet to be explored. MAIN METHODS: Prevention of oxaliplatin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and formalin-induced nociception were assessed following intraperitoneal administration of MG and CB1, CB2, or TRPV1 antagonists in wildtype and cannabinoid receptor knockout mice. The effects of oxaliplatin and MG exposure on the spinal cord endocannabinoid lipidome was assessed by HPLC-MS/MS. KEY FINDINGS: The efficacy of MG on oxaliplatin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was partially attenuated upon genetic deletion of cannabinoid receptors, and completely blocked upon pharmacological inhibition of CB1, CB2, and TRPV1 channels. This cannabinoid involvement was found to be selective to a model of neuropathic pain, with minimal effects on MG-induced antinociception in a model of formalin-induced pain. Oxaliplatin was found to selectively disrupt the endocannabinoid lipidome in the spinal cord, which was prevented by repeated MG exposure. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that cannabinoid mechanisms contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of the kratom alkaloid MG in a model of CIPN, which may result in increased therapeutic efficacy when co-administered with cannabinoids.",

Despite no federal policy in the United States, individual states have implemented diverging policies through kratom bans, and legalization and regulation through Kratom Consumer Protection Acts (KCPAs). The Survey of Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs (NMURx) Program employs nationally-representative, repeated cross-sectional surveys on drug use. In 2021, weighted prevalence of past-12 month kratom use was compared across three state legal frameworks: no overarching state policy, KCPAs, and state bans. There was lower estimated prevalence of kratom use in banned states (prevalence: 0.75% (0.44, 1.06) relative to states with a KCPA (1.20% (0.89, 1.51)), and relative to states with no policies (1.04% (0.94, 1.13), though odds of use were not significantly associated with policy type. Kratom use was significantly associated with medicated treatment for opioid use disorder. While there were observed differences in the prevalence of past-12 month kratom use by state policy type, low uptake mitigated meaningful distinctions by limiting statistical precision, and potentially confounding effects, such as accessibility online. Future kratom-related policy decisions should be informed through evidence-based research.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Use of \"kratom\" products, derived from the bioactive botanical Mitragyna speciosa have increased amidst US polydrug use epidemics. Kratom alkaloids interact with opioid, serotonergic, adrenergic, and other receptors and regular users have described experiencing a wide range of effects. Some with polydrug use histories have reported using kratom as a substitute for other drugs or to nonmedically self-manage substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms. Data describing this remain scare and come from self-report. We review this literature describing kratom use as a drug substitute, or as a nonmedical \"self-treatment\" for attenuating dependence or SUD symptoms. RECENT FINDINGS: Kratom products have been documented as being used as a licit and illicit opioid substitute. Use to reduce alcohol or stimulant consumption is less well documented. Although prior and current polydrug use appear common among a some kratom users, it is unclear if co-use is contemporaneous or concomitant. Temporal order of use initiation is typically undocumented. Use for energy and recreation are also increasingly reported. SUMMARY: Data on kratom consumption come primarily from self-report with significant limitations. Until controlled human laboratory studies have been conducted, we can presently only describe what is known about human kratom use based on self-report. Such data describe real-world kratom use, leaving unaddressed human abuse liability or therapeutic potential of kratom alkaloids. Clinicians should be mindful of use motivations among people with SUD histories, sensitively assessing use. The paucity of data highlights the urgent need to increase funding and research for understanding kratom's effects in humans."

This narrative review aims to educate clinicians on the mechanisms of action, toxicity, and applications of psychoactive plant-based substances patients may be using to self-treat OUD and OW. We specifically discuss ayahuasca, ibogaine, and kratom as they have the most evidence for applications in OUD and OW from the last decade (2012-2022). Evidence suggests these substances may have efficacy in treating OW and OUD through several therapeutic mechanisms including their unique pharmacodynamic effects, rituals performed around ingestion, and increased neuroplasticity. The current evidence for their therapeutic application in OUD and OW is primarily based on small observational studies or animal studies. High-quality, longitudinal studies are needed to clarify safety and efficacy of these substances in treatment of OW and OUD.",

However, there is no scientific evidence to validate the antidiabetic effect of M. speciosa. This study investigated the antidiabetic effects of M. speciosa (Krat) ethanolic extract on fructose and streptozocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic rats. In vitro antioxidant and antidiabetic effects were evaluated using DPPH, ABST, FRAP and α-glucosidase inhibitory assays. Rats with fructose/STZ induced T2D were treated with Krat (100 and 400 mg/kg) or metformin (200 mg/kg) for 5 weeks via oral gavage. Krat showed good antioxidant activity and also displayed potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Administration of Krat to the diabetic rats significantly improved body weight gain, restored alterations in blood glucose level, glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia (increased cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and reduced high-density lipoprotein), hepatorenal biomarkers alterations (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alanine phosphatase, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen) and oxidative stress indices (superoxide dismutase, glutathione and malondialdehyde)in the treated diabetic rats. Furthermore, Krat also restored pancreatic histological and increased immunohistochemical aberrations in the diabetic rats. These results for the first time demonstrated the antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic potentials of M. speciosa, thus providing scientific reinforcement for the traditional use of the plant in the treatment of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Kratom (KT) typically exerts antidepressant (AD) effects. However, evaluating which form of KT extracts possesses AD properties similar to the standard AD fluoxetine (flu) remained challenging. Here, we adopted an autoencoder (AE)-based anomaly detector called ANet to measure the similarity of mice's local field potential (LFP) features that responded to KT leave extracts and AD flu. The features that responded to KT syrup had the highest similarity to those that responded to the AD flu at 87.11 $\\pm$ 0.25%. This finding presents the higher feasibility of using KT syrup as an alternative substance for depressant therapy than KT alkaloids and KT aqueous, which are the other candidates in this study. Apart from the similarity measurement, we utilized ANet as a multi-task AE and evaluated the performance in discriminating multi-class LFP responses corresponding to the effect of different KT extracts and AD flu simultaneously. Furthermore, we visualized learned latent features among LFP responses qualitatively and quantitatively as t-SNE projection and maximum mean discrepancy distance, respectively. The classification results reported the accuracy and F1-score of 90.11 $\\pm$ 0.11% and 90.08 $\\pm$ 0.00%. In summary, the outcomes of this research might help therapeutic design devices for an alternative substance profile evaluation, such as Kratom-based form, in real-world applications."

This plant has sparked significant interest as a potential alternative treatment for managing opioid dependence and withdrawal due to its opioid-like pharmacological effects. However, whether MG exposure would trigger opioid-seeking behaviour following abstinence has not been investigated. The present study examined the effects of MG priming on morphine-seeking behaviour in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were initially trained to intravenously self-administer morphine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) under a fixed ratio-3 schedule of reinforcement. Removal of both morphine infusions and drug-associated cues led to the subsequent extinction of the drug-seeking behaviour. Tests of reinstatement were made following exposure to a randomised order of intraperitoneal injections of MG (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), morphine (5 mg/kg) and vehicle. Significant levels of drug-seeking behaviour were observed following extended access to morphine self-administration, which was extinguished following removal of morphine and cues indicative of morphine-seeking behaviour, supporting the relapse model. The present finding demonstrated that MG priming in a dose of 10 mg/kg resulted in the reinstatement of morphine-seeking behaviour, whereas the higher MG dose (30 mg/kg) tested suppressed the seeking response. This study indicated that exposure to a low MG dose may increase the likelihood of relapsing to opioids, suggesting that the potential of MG as a treatment for opioid management merits further scientific assessment of its ability to trigger relapse to opioid abuse.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mitragyna speciosa (commonly known as kratom) has both opioid and stimulant-like effects. Recently, Thailand decriminalized the possession and sale of kratom which led people in many areas to seek income from the sale of kratom at a time of widespread unemployment due to COVID-19. Here, we report a patient with post-COVID syndrome who developed a mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular liver injury secondary to kratom. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old Thai man was seen for an evaluation of fatigue and nausea which was soon followed by pruritus, dark urine and jaundice. The patient had no known underlying disease but had been treated with mild COVID-19 pneumonia in the past 2 months. He reported taking kratom recreationally for 2 weeks as a treatment for his post-COVID insomnia. Kratom was purchased from a friend and used in a homemade iced cocktail called \"4 × 100\" consisting of Coca-Cola, tea made from boiled kratom leaves, and diphenhydramine-containing cough syrup which has been popular in Southernmost provinces of Thailand. His lab workup showed his total bilirubin to be 10.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase was 642 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase was 1635 U/L. Extensive workups including viral etiologies was negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed normal liver and no cirrhosis. The case was managed conservatively for 5 days in the hospital by giving intravenous fluid and stopping all medications. Urine toxicology screening confirmed the presence of mitragynine and diphenhydramine. He was in a stable condition with normalized liver function tests at 3 months after discharge. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to health consequences and this case highlights the importance of kratom as potential cause of acute liver injury. Future studies should accumulate further case series and identify kratom-user subgroups or the polydrug patterns of kratom use that are at heightened risk of severe liver injury."

Previous data on the blood sugar and lipid-altering effects of kratom are limited. In this study, phytochemical analyses of mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, quercetin, and rutin were performed in kratom extracts. The effects on α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase activities were investigated in kratom extracts and mitragynine. The LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the mitragynine, quercetin, and rutin contents from kratom extracts were different. The ethanol extract exhibited the highest total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total alkaloid content (TAC). Additionally, compared to methanol and aqueous extracts, the ethanol extract showed the strongest inhibition activity against α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase. Compared with the anti-diabetic agent acarbose, mitragynine showed the most potent α-glucosidase inhibition, with less potent activity of pancreatic lipase inhibition. Analysis of α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase kinetics revealed that mitragynine inhibited noncompetitive and competitive effects, respectively. Combining mitragynine with acarbose resulted in a synergistic interaction with α-glucosidase inhibition. These results have established the potential of mitragynine from kratom as a herbal supplement for the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus.",

However, additional research on PSU heterogeneity in populations using this novel psychoactive substance is necessary. The authors investigated patterns of past 12-month PSU among US adults reporting past 12-month use of kratom and at least one additional substance. METHODS: Latent class models were fit using 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data which was collected from 412 US adults reporting past 12-month use of kratom and at least one of 11 additional substances. RESULTS: Three distinct profiles were identified: \"marijuana/alcohol/tobacco\" (63.3%), \"marijuana/alcohol/tobacco + psychedelics\" (19.3%), and \"marijuana/alcohol/tobacco + psychedelics/heroin/prescriptions\" (17.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first epidemiological study in which a latent class analysis was used to identify unique PSU profiles among US adults using kratom and other substances. Understanding the profiles of people using kratom in relation to the use of other drugs might help guide screening interventions, treatment needs, and policy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kratom, a plant indigenous to Southeast Asia, which has been used both recreationally and in the treatment of pain and opioid dependence, has received little scrutiny in the United States and almost none in Canada. We analyzed calls to the British Columbia poison centre to describe caller-declared exposures to kratom and the acute health effects of these exposures. METHODS: For this descriptive analysis, we accessed electronic records, including transcriptions and extracted variables, of calls specifying kratom exposure managed by the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre (DPIC) from 2012 to 2019. We describe changes in case numbers, reasons for exposure, concurrent drug exposures and clinical outcomes over the study period. RESULTS: We identified 32 cases during the study period. In 23 cases (72%), the DPIC was consulted by a health care worker. Case numbers increased from 0 in 2012 to 9 in 2019. Numbers were highest for males in their 20s (n = 17, 53%). A total of 27 cases (84%) involved ingestion, with online distributors and local stores named as sources of procurement. A concurrent drug exposure was identified in 13 (41%) cases. There were no deaths; in 1 case, the exposed individual was intubated to manage agitation following kratom withdrawal. INTERPRETATION: We observed a steady increase in kratom-related poison centre calls from 2012 to 2019, especially in young adult males. Rising call numbers may reflect increasing availability of kratom and may be a consequence of BC's opioid crisis, with kratom used by some to lessen symptoms of opioid withdrawal.",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have repeatedly subjected kratom to regulatory review. However, there hasn't been a systematic review of the public's perception of kratom. The present study analyzed open-ended responses from the public to an FDA solicitation for information regarding kratom with the goal of providing a comprehensive assessment of motives for kratom use. METHODS: To guide decisions regarding kratom regulation, the FDA solicited comments regarding kratom abuse potential, medical usefulness, and impact of scheduling changes from July through August 2021 and posted them to the Federal Register website. We analyzed comments posted during the first 6 weeks of comment solicitation (6,353) using an inductive approach via qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Respondents reported 106 independent health-related reasons for kratom use, with most categorized as mental health, pain management, substance use disorder, or miscellaneous purposes that included increasing focus, treating insomnia, and decreasing fatigue. Neurological diseases and digestive disorders were also reported. Relatively few (< 2%) responses reported recreational use, abuse potential, or adverse effects of kratom. CONCLUSIONS: Although kratom is not approved as a safe and effective therapy for any indication, individuals use kratom for a broad spectrum of health-related purposes. Limitations of this study include potential bias for respondents with perceived positive experiences using kratom, lack of demographics data, and lack of independent verification of claims made by respondents. Regardless, this study reflects perceptions regarding the therapeutic uses of kratom and provides insight into potential individual-level consequences of regulating kratom in the U.S. It is important to study the public's perception of kratom use, which can aid regulatory purposes and provide clinically important information on individuals' use and valuation of kratom.",

In the United States, its use continues to grow. Kratom products, however, are unregulated and nonstandardized, and reports of adulteration have been described previously. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old African-American woman with a history of occasional headaches and self-treatment with internet-purchased kratom presented to the emergency department with the chief symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and left flank pain. Laboratory tests showed a markedly elevated serum creatinine of 4.25 mg/dL (reference range 0.6-1.2 mg/dL) and proteinuria. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was unrevealing. A standard urine screen for drugs of abuse was positive for opiates. A confirmatory testing revealed the presence of hydrocodone and morphine in the urine. Hydrocodone, morphine, and mitragynine were identified in a sample of kratom leaves provided by the patient. The patient's renal function improved with supportive care and normalized 1 month post discharge after kratom discontinuation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Despite widespread use, relatively little is known about kratom's adverse effects, particularly regarding its potential to cause renal insufficiency. This case illustrates the vital importance of recognizing that adulteration of unregulated products is certainly a possibility and clinicians may continue to see a rise in adverse effects, given kratom's increasing popularity.",

Kratom is being increasingly used in the West for its reputed benefits in the treatment of pain, depression, and opioid use disorder (OUD). Recent studies from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Silver Spring, MD, USA) and our laboratory have shown that many kratom products being sold in the United States are contaminated with potentially hazardous levels of lead (Pb). In this commentary, we discuss the public health implications of the presence of Pb in kratom products, particularly as they relate to the predicted levels of Pb exposure among kratom users. We also considered the specific toxic effects of Pb and how they might relate to the known physiologic and toxicologic effects of kratom. Finally, we consider the possible sources of Pb in kratom products and suggest several areas for research on this issue."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Kratom, an unregulated herbal supplement, has emerged as self-treatment for anxiety/depression. Kratom exhibits inhibition at multiple cytochrome P450 isozymes involved in metabolism of prescription medications, including serotonergic agents. We report a case of possible serotonin syndrome induced by kratom use in combination with prescription psychotropic medications. CASE: A 63-year-old male presented with diaphoresis, flushing, aphasia, confusion, dysarthria, right facial droop, and oral temperature of 39.6oC (103.2oF), lactate 2.7 mmol/L, and creatine phosphokinase of 1507 IU/L. Initial differential diagnoses included acute ischemic stroke and bacterial meningitis. Despite partial treatment with alteplase and broad-spectrum antibiotics, symptoms persisted, and subsequent physical exam noted hyperreflexia, clonus, tremors, and temperature of 41.1oC (106oF). Home medications included a chronic regimen for anxiety/depression with bupropion, buspirone, desvenlafaxine, trazodone, and ziprasidone, in addition to kratom. Clinical suspicion for serotonin syndrome led to initiation of cyproheptadine, lorazepam, and cooling blankets. Aphasia, facial droop, and confusion improved after administration of cyproheptadine. Bupropion was restarted during hospitalization; remaining medications restarted at the discretion of the primary care provider. DISCUSSION: Risk of serotonin syndrome with multiple serotonergic agents is well-known. Kratom is metabolized by cytochrome P40 isozymes 3A4, 2C9, and 2D6, and exhibits inhibition at those enzymes, in addition to 1A2. Pharmacokinetic interactions of kratom with prescription serotonergic agents metabolized through these isozymes has the potential to increase systemic exposure of serotonin, potentially leading to serotonin syndrome. CONCLUSION: Because substances contained in kratom can inhibit metabolism of prescription serotonergic medications, clinicians must be aware of potential development of serotonin syndrome.",

Kratom's relative novelty makes for a dynamic situation, such that use motivations are not firmly established and may be changing. Investigators and clinicians require frequent updates on kratom trends.Objectives: To assess the current state of kratom-use initiation, sourcing, motivations, preference, conceptualizations, and perceived stigma, using survey responses from current and former users.Methods: Between April-May 2021 we recontacted 289 respondents who reported lifetime kratom use (on an unrelated survey) to answer kratom-specific questions.Results: The sample (N=129) was majority female (51.9%) and white (71.9%). Most (69.0%) reported first trying kratom after 2015. Mean age of use initiation (29.9 years) was older than for other substances, including opioids. Kratom ranked as a preferred substance by 48.5%. The strongest drug association with past-year kratom use was vaped nicotine (OR=3.31,95% CI 1.23-8.88). Use was less likely among those prescribed buprenorphine in the past year (OR=0.03, CI 0.01-0.28). Past-month cannabis use (OR=4.18,CI 1.80-9.72) had the strongest association with past-month kratom use. Over 40 use motivations were endorsed, many (but not all) supporting the \"self-treatment\" narrative of kratom use, including use as an opioid, alcohol, or stimulant substitute. Treatment shortfalls were associated with decisions to try kratom.Conclusions: Kratom use motivations are diversifying, with multiple factors driving use. As sales continue to increase, the public-health, clinical, and policy responses to kratom should be grounded in rigorous bench-to-bedside scientific research. Comprehensive study of kratom is currently lacking.",

Most of the adverse effects of kratom and its alkaloid mitragynine have been reported in the literature as case reports or part of surveys necessitating confirmation by clinical trials. Toxicities associated with kratom consumption have focused on hepatic, cardiac, and CNS effects with the potential to cause fatalities primarily as part of polydrug exposures. Kratom may also present with drug-drug interactions primarily through CYP 3A4 and 2D6 inhibition, although the clinical significance remains unknown to date. The variability in composition of commercially available kratom products complicates generalization of findings and requires further investigation by employing clinical trials.

We applaud the authors for helping to advance the science on kratom and recognize the difficulties in conducting kratom-related clinical assessment and research. However, a number of inconsistences and generalizations were identified in this Case Report, which also lacked some critical context. Importantly, such inconsistencies and generalizations can be observed throughout kratom-specific case reports. We feel this is now an important opportunity to highlight these issues that are present in the Broyan and colleagues Case report but emphasize that they are not unique to it. We do this with the hope that by acknowledging these issues it can help inform editors, clinicians, and researchers who may not be familiar with kratom and, as a result of this unfamiliarity, may inadvertently present findings in a manner that could confuse readers and even misinform clinical researchers and practitioners.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) consumption and associated health effects have raised debates in the United States. Although most people using this herb do not experience adverse health effects associated with kratom use, medical providers should be knowledgeable of emerging substances and concurrent, sequential, or simultaneous use of other drugs which may impact healthcare recommendations and prescribing practices. METHODS: The objective of this narrative review was to elucidate selected health effects associated with using kratom-either alone or with other substances. Since scientifically controlled human subjects research on kratom use is still limited, relevant case reports were also described. RESULTS: Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and psychiatric effects associated with kratom use were especially notable, and in-utero exposure accompanied concern regarding a neonate's risk for developing neonatal abstinence syndrome. Our ability to identify and understand the role of this herb in kratom-associated fatalities is complicated since kratom is not routinely screened for in standard forensic toxicology. If a screening is performed, it is usually for the major alkaloid, mitragynine, as a surrogate for kratom use. In addition to lacking a standard practice of screening decedents for kratom alkaloids, the association between mortality and kratom use may be confounded by polysubstance use, adulteration of kratom products, and drug-herb interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing medical awareness of this herb is vital to ensuring prompt administration of best-practice medical advice or treatment for people seeking information related to kratom use or for patients experiencing an adverse health effect that may be associated with using or withdrawing from kratom. Knowledge gained from continued surveillance and study of kratom and its associated health effects may assist in guiding clinical decision-making and preventing development of adverse health effects among people using kratom."

      "abstract": "Kratom is an evergreen tree that is native to Southeast Asia. Its leafs are traditionally used as a stimulant, a remedy for various health problems and for religious purposes. Especially in the US (in a lesser extent also in Europe) kratom use is significantly prevalent. In Western countries, kratom is used predominantly as an analgesic and stimulant, for the treatment of opioid use disorders, and for improving mental health (e. g., in depression, anxiety disorders). Main molecular constituents of kratom are alkaloids of which mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine appear to be most important. Pharmacodynamics and -kinetics of kratom are complex and insufficiently studied. It is known that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are partial agonist at human μ-opioid receptors and antagonists at κ- and δ-opioid receptors with additional effects at other central receptors. Tolerability of kratom is presumably better than that of classical opioids; this is probably due to missing effects of kratom on β-arrestin and discussed as a starting point for the development of opioids with improved tolerability. Some alkaloids of kratom are inhibitors of CYP26 and to a somewhat lesser degree of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. The addictive potential of kratom appears to be lower than that of classical opioids; however, corresponding data is limited and kratom use disorders appear to occur primarily in Western countries. Several cases of severe health-related problems and deaths are known in the US; in these cases, however, polysubstance use was usually present. Kratom use is likely associated with hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Kratom-associated mortality and morbidity in Western countries are quantitatively significantly different from Southeast Asia, where kratom use is no public health problem. The reasons for this may be the combined use of substances (which is more prevalent in Western countries), higher dosages of consumed kratom, adulterations and contaminations of commercially available kratom in Western countries, pharmacokinetic interactions, and higher concentrations of 7-hydroxymitragynine in dried kratom leafs (that are typically consumed in Western countries) in comparison to fresh leafs (that are typically consumed in Southeast Asia).",

      "abstract": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is an easily accessible dietary supplement gaining notoriety in medicine for its use as a surrogate form of self-driven opioid use disorder treatment, albeit one with a lack of evidence and significant risks. Both misuse and withdrawal from kratom have been appreciated in the literature and addressed in a fashion analogous to that of opioids. Because of this, it has largely been studied through the looking glass of its properties of agonizing μ-opioid and likely α2-adrenergic receptors. While an important area of study, the correlation with kratom and stimulant use, reflected in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, is one that often gets neglected clinically. In our manuscript we present three unique cases, demonstrative of the overlap kratom misuse may have with stimulant use disorders in distinct settings. We provide a discussion and review of this correlation in light of kratom use increasing in the United States.",

Objectives: This investigation clarifies kratom's role in perceived well-being, overall health, and temporal correlation with drug use to understand kratom's role in the self-treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs). Methods: Between July 2019 and July 2020 an anonymous, cross-sectional, online survey was taken by 7,381 people who use kratom (PWUK) recruited through social media and other online resources. This included an assessment of (a) the relationship between self-reported overall health, concomitant use of drugs of misuse, and demographics; (b) the perceived effectiveness of kratom in self-treating diagnosed health conditions or symptoms; (c) the profile of PWUK primarily for drug dependence, pain, and mood or mental health conditions based on demographics. Results: A total of 5,152 valid responses (45.9% females/53.7% males) were collected. Kratom was primarily used for self-treating pain (73.0%) and improving emotional or mental health conditions (42.2%) without clinical supervision. Those with a SUD (synthetic opioids, methadone, benzodiazepines, or heroin) used kratom after discontinuing illicit or other drugs (94.8%). The primary substances taken before or concomitantly with kratom were cannabis, cannabidiol, benzodiazepines, or kava. PWUKs report a dose-dependent benefit for alleviating pain and relieving negative moods. Adverse effects were primarily gastrointestinal, typically at high (>5 g/dose) and frequent (>22 doses/week) dosing. Conclusions: Kratom was primarily used as a harm-reduction agent for SUDs and self-treatment of chronic conditions. Healthcare professionals need better information about kratom, its potential adverse effects, and clinically significant drug interactions.",

METHODS: We reviewed the literature published over the past 20 years, including peer-reviewed publications and data released by United States government health agencies to provide an overview of this topic. RESULTS: A variety of potentially beneficial and adverse effects of kratom use related to its opioid and stimulant properties have been documented, including addiction and withdrawal. Preliminary research in animals and case reports in humans have suggested medical utility for kratom in treating alcohol and opioid use disorders, pain, depression, and anxiety. However, the lack of controlled, standardized studies limits the clinical utility of this agent and is a barrier to safe consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Historically, kratom has been used for medical purposes and for the treatment of alcohol and substance use disorders. The currently available literature suggests a potential for similar clinical applications. However, without controlled research studies or regulation, kratom poses numerous health risks to consumers.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Since 2007, kratom use in the United States has increased, centered around nonmedical self-treatment of pain, psychiatric, and substance use disorder symptoms. Reports of kratom withdrawal have emerged amidst description of therapeutic effects, yet we know little about disordered use. Our objective was to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 substance use disorder for kratom (\"kratom use disorder,\" KUD) and examine kratom withdrawal symptoms among those who ever used regularly. We also sought to identify clinical characteristics of respondents who qualified for current, remitted, or never KUD. METHODS: Between April and May 2021, we re-recruited online respondents who reported lifetime kratom use on an unrelated survey into our cross-sectional kratom survey study, permitting a diverse sample of current and former kratom-using persons. RESULTS: A total of 129/289 (44.6%) evaluable surveys were obtained. Over half (52.7%) of respondents never met KUD diagnostic criteria; 17.8% were assessed remitted, and 29.5% met current (past-year) KUD threshold. For past-year KUD, severity was: 14.0% mild, 7.0% moderate, and 8.5% severe. Pain, psychiatric symptoms, and polydrug use were found across all groups. KUD symptoms reflected increased use, tolerance, withdrawal, unsuccessful quit attempts, and craving; 9.3% reported decreases in important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of use. Withdrawal symptoms were moderate and included gastrointestinal upset, restlessness, anxiety, irritability, fatigue/low energy, and craving. CONCLUSIONS: As assessed here, tolerance and withdrawal are primary KUD features rather than psychosocial impairments. As kratomis often used among persons with a myriad of health conditions, clinicians should be aware of and assess for kratom use and withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Drugs are regulated in the United States (US) by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) if assessment of their abuse potential, including public health risks, show such control is warranted. An evaluation via the 8 factors of the CSA provides the comprehensive assessment required for permanent listing of new chemical entities and previously uncontrolled substances. Such an assessment was published for two kratom alkaloids in 2018 that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have identified as candidates for CSA listing: mitragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG) (Henningfield et al., 2018a). That assessment concluded the abuse potential of MG was within the range of many other uncontrolled substances, that there was not evidence of an imminent risk to public health, and that a Schedule I listing (the only option for substances that are not FDA approved for therapeutic use such as kratom) carried public health risks including drug overdoses by people using kratom to abstain from opioids. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated abuse potential assessment reviewing greater than 100 studies published since January 1, 2018. These include studies of abuse potential and physical dependence/withdrawal in animals; in-vitro receptor binding; assessments of potential efficacy treating pain and substance use disorders; pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies with safety-related findings; clinical studies of long-term users with various physiological endpoints; and surveys of patterns and reasons for use and associated effects including dependence and withdrawal. Findings from these studies suggest that public health is better served by assuring continued access to kratom products by consumers and researchers. Currently, Kratom alkaloids and derivatives are in development as safer and/or more effective medicines for treating pain, substances use disorders, and mood disorders. Placing kratom in the CSA via scheduling would criminalize consumers and possession, seriously impede research, and can be predicted to have serious adverse public health consequences, including potentially thousands of drug overdose deaths. Therefore, CSA listing is not recommended. Regulation to minimize risks of contaminated, adulterated, and inappropriately marketed products is recommended."

      "abstract": "Background: Kratom, a tree native to Southeast Asia, is increasingly used in Western countries for self-treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, and mitigation of withdrawal symptoms from drugs of abuse. Because kratom is solely supplied from its native locations, supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the availability of preparations and hence force consumers to change their patterns of use. The aim of this study was to understand if and how COVID-19 was influencing kratom purchasing and use. Methods: Additional questions specific to kratom availability and changes in use during COVID-19 were added to an international online survey with responses collected between January and July 2020. During the same period, kratom-related social media posts to Twitter, Reddit, and Bluelight were analyzed for themes similar to the survey questions. Results: The survey results indicated no changes in kratom use patterns although the sample size was relatively small (n = 70) with younger consumers reporting a potential issue in obtaining their desired products from their usual sources. The survey respondents identified primarily as non-Hispanic whites (87.1%). Social media themes revolved primarily around quitting kratom during COVID-19, misinformation about the effects of kratom on COVID-19, and other non-COVID-related discussions. While some consumers may increase their kratom dose because of additional stress, a majority of discussions centered around reducing or rationing kratom due to COVID-19 or a perceived dependence. Access to quality kratom products was also a major discussion topic on social media. Conclusions: Kratom use patterns did not change due to COVID-19 but consumers were concerned about potential product shortages and resulting quality issues. Clinicians and public health officials need to be informed and educated about kratom use as a potential mitigation strategy for substance use disorders and for self-treatment of pain.",

Mitragynine, a major alkaloid contained in kratom leaves, has been shown to inhibit multiple cytochromes P450 (CYPs) in vitro, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A. As such, kratom may precipitate pharmacokinetic drug interactions when co-consumed with certain medications. We present a case of a patient taking 150 mg venlafaxine (CYP2D6/3A substrate), 300 mg quetiapine (CYP3A substrate), and a high amount of kratom (~90 g) daily. The patient presented to the emergency department with serotonin syndrome and corrected electrocardiogram abnormalities that may have been secondary to supratherapeutic exposure to venlafaxine and/or quetiapine. The patient's symptoms resolved after discontinuation of venlafaxine and quetiapine. He was amenable to medication therapy for kratom discontinuation and successfully completed an at-home induction with buprenorphine/naloxone. This case report adds to the literature about potential pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions and suggests that buprenorphine/naloxone can facilitate recovery from kratom use disorder.",

      "abstract": "Background: Opioid agonist therapy with buprenorphine is an effective, evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. However, there has been increasing use of alternative substances which can still produce opioid-like effects. One of these substances is the herbal supplement kratom. The chemical composition of kratom, specifically mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, has partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and antagonist effects at the kappa- and delta-opioid receptors. Due to its addictive potential, accessibility, and legal status, there have been increasing cases of kratom use disorder (KUD). Thus, it is important to consider effective treatment options for this nontraditional substance. Methods: Twenty-eight patients self-identified kratom as their primary substance of use. Length of kratom use ranged between 1 month and 25 years, with an average daily kratom dose of 92 g/d. Nine patients were inducted on a buprenorphine/naloxone dose between 1 and 6 mg, 18 patients between 8 and 16 mg, and 1 patient at 20 mg. Three patients were stabilized on a dose at 4 mg, 23 patients between 8 and 16 mg, 1 patient at 18 mg, and 1 patient at 20 mg. Results: There was no correlation between stabilizing dose of buprenorphine/naloxone and past daily dose of kratom. As of March 2020, 20 of the 28 patients were still receiving outpatient buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. Six patients were lost to follow-up due to missed appointments, 1 tapered down to 0.25 mg of buprenorphine/naloxone and self-discharged, and 1 moved out of town. The rest have remained in treatment from 5 to 22 months, with an average duration of 11 months. Of the 28 patients, 68%, 82%, and 82% had negative test results for mitragynine at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest case series exploring long-term buprenorphine/naloxone treatment for KUD. Our findings suggest buprenorphine/naloxone can be used as an effective treatment option for KUD.",

      "abstract": "Kratom products available in the United States are becoming increasingly diverse both in terms of content and in terms of how they are marketed. Prior survey research indicates that kratom has been primarily used in the US to self-treat anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, and substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms. Kratom is also well-known for its use as a short- or long-term full opioid agonist substitute. Therefore, use may be greater in regions particularly impacted by addiction to prescription opioids. Use may also be greater in demographic groups targeted by media outlets (such as specific podcasts) in which kratom is touted. Here, we aimed to determine whether lifetime and past-year kratom use were associated with region of residence and with being young, White, post-secondary educated, and employed. To strengthen confidence in our findings, we analyzed data from two sources: our own crowdsourced online convenience sample and the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). In our sample (N = 2,615), 11.1% reported lifetime and 6.7% reported past-year kratom use, and the odds of kratom use were higher among people who were White, younger, at least high school educated, employed, and above the poverty line, as well as those reporting nonmedical opioid use, past-year SUD, or lifetime SUD treatment; residence was not a significant predictor. In NSDUH data, suburban residence and other demographic factors, concordant with those from the crowdsourced sample, were associated with kratom use. Taken together, the findings support a general \"White middle-class suburban\" profile of the modal kratom user, but more research is needed to understand it. In the interim, focus should be on our finding that lifetime nonmedical opioid use was associated with an up to five times greater likelihood of past-year kratom use, suggesting that drug-use history may presently be the strongest predictor of kratom use."

So too is the use of the psychoactive botanical \"kratom,\" including among people with NMO and methamphetamine use histories. We assessed characteristics associated with respondent groups who reported lifetime methamphetamine and/or kratom use within a nationally representative US sample using 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data from respondents reporting lifetime NMO use (diverted prescription opioids, heroin). Weighted prevalence estimates for demographic, mental health, and substance use outcomes were determined. Logistic regression examined associations between group membership and outcomes. Among this sample of respondents with lifetime NMO use, 67.6% (95% CI = 65.6-69.4%) reported only NMO use; 4.6% (3.9-5.4%) reported NMO+Kratom; 24.7% (22.7-26.7%) reported NMO+Methamphetamine; and 3.2% (2.5-3.9%) reported NMO+Methamphetamine+Kratom. Compared to those in the NMO-only group, the NMO+Kratom group was more likely to report past-year serious mental illness (SMI; OR = 2.27), suicidality (OR = 1.89), and past-month psychological distress (OR = 1.88). The NMO+Methamphetamine+Kratom group was more likely to report past-year SMI (OR = 2.65), past-month psychological distress (OR = 2.06), and unmet mental health needs (OR = 2.03); increased odds for drug injection, opioid withdrawal, and perceived treatment need also emerged. Risk factors were observed for all groups but were greatest among those reporting use of all three substances.",

      "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Mitragyna speciosa extract and kratom alkaloids decrease alcohol consumption in mice at least in part through actions at the δ-opioid receptor (δOR). However, the most potent opioidergic kratom alkaloid, 7-hydroxymitragynine, exhibits rewarding properties and hyperlocomotion presumably due to preferred affinity for the mu opioid receptor (µOR). We hypothesized that opioidergic kratom alkaloids like paynantheine and speciogynine with reduced µOR potency could provide a starting point for developing opioids with an improved therapeutic window to treat alcohol use disorder. Experimental Approach: We characterized paynantheine, speciociliatine, and four novel kratom-derived analogs for their ability to bind and activate δOR, µOR, and κOR. Select opioids were assessed in behavioral assays in male C57BL/6N WT and δOR knockout mice. Key Results: Paynantheine (10 mg∙kg-1, i.p.) produced aversion in a limited conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm but did not produce CPP with additional conditioning sessions. Paynantheine did not produce robust antinociception but did block morphine-induced antinociception and hyperlocomotion. Yet, at 10 and 30 mg∙kg-1 doses (i.p.), paynantheine did not counteract morphine CPP. 7-hydroxypaynantheine and 7-hydroxyspeciogynine displayed potency at δOR but limited µOR potency relative to 7-hydroxymitragynine in vitro, and dose-dependently decreased voluntary alcohol consumption in WT but not δOR in KO mice. 7-hydroxyspeciogynine has a maximally tolerated dose of at least 10 mg∙kg-1 (s.c.) at which it did not produce significant CPP neither alter general locomotion nor induce noticeable seizures. Conclusion and Implications: Derivatizing kratom alkaloids with the goal of enhancing δOR potency and reducing off-target effects could provide a pathway to develop novel lead compounds to treat alcohol use disorder with an improved therapeutic window."

      "abstract": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) consists of over 40 alkaloids, with 2 of them, mitragynine and 7-OH-mitragynine (7-OH-MG) being the main psychoactive compounds. Mitragynine and 7-OH-mitragynine each target opioid receptors and have been referred to as atypical opioids. They exert their pharmacologic effects on the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors. In addition, they affect adrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic pathways. Kratom has been touted as an inexpensive, legal alternative to standard opioid replacement therapy such as methadone and buprenorphine. Other uses for kratom include chronic pain, attaining a \"legal high,\" and numerous central nervous system disorders, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Kratom induces analgesia and mild euphoria, with a lower risk of respiratory depression or adverse central nervous system effects compared to traditional opioid medications. Nonetheless, kratom has been associated with both physical and psychological dependence, with some individuals experiencing classic opioid withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt cessation. Kratom use has been linked to serious adverse effects, including liver toxicity, seizures, and death. These risks are often compounded by polysubstance abuse. Further, kratom may potentiate the toxicity of coadministered medications through modulation of cytochrome P450, P-glycoprotein, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. In 2016, the US Drug Enforcement Administration took steps to classify kratom as a federal schedule 1 medication; however, due to public resistance, this plan was set aside. Until studies are conducted that define kratom's role in treating opioid withdrawal and/or other central nervous system conditions, kratom will likely remain available as a dietary supplement for the foreseeable future.",

      "abstract": "Kratom, a plant that produces opioid-like effects, has gained popularity in the U.S. for self-treating symptoms of chronic pain, mood disorders, and substance-use disorders (SUDs). Most data on kratom are from surveys into which current kratom-using adults could self-select; such surveys may underrepresent people who have used kratom and chosen to stop. Available data also do not adequately assess important psychosocial factors surrounding kratom use. In this study, U.S. adults who reported past 6-month alcohol, opioid, and/or stimulant use (N = 1,670) were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk between September and December 2020. Of the 1,510 evaluable respondents, 202 (13.4%) reported lifetime kratom use. Kratom-using adults, relative to others, were typically younger, male, unpartnered, without children, and had lower income. They had higher rates of chronic pain (31.7% vs. 21.9%, p = .003), childhood adversity, anxiety, and depression (p < .001), and lower perceived social rank (d = .19, .02-.22) and socioeconomic status (d = .37 .16-.26). They also reported higher use rates for most substances (except alcohol); this included medically supervised and unsupervised use of prescription opioids and diverted opioid agonist therapy (OAT) medications. Most (83.2%) met diagnostic criteria for any past-year SUD. Those reporting kratom use were less likely to reside in an urban/suburban area. The strongest predictors of kratom use were use of other drugs: cannabidiol (OR = 3.73), psychedelics (OR = 3.39), and nonmedical prescription opioids (OR = 1.72). Another strong predictor was lifetime OAT utilization (OR = 2.31). Despite seemingly poorer psychosocial functioning and health among respondents reporting lifetime kratom use, use of other substances may be the strongest indicators of kratom use.

      "abstract": "Kratom is a widely abused plant-based drug preparation with a global interest in recent years, well beyond its native grounds in Southeast Asia. Mitragynine, its major psychoactive constituent is known to exhibit opioid-like behavioral effects with resultant neuroplasticity in the brain reward system. Its chronic administration is associated with cognitive impairments in animal studies. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for such a deficit remains elusive. In this study, the involvement of cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors in cognitive deficits after chronic mitragynine exposures was investigated for 28 days (with incremental dose sensitization from 1 to 25 mg/kg) in adult male Swiss albino mice using the IntelliCage® system. Chronic high-dose mitragynine exposure (5-25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]), but not low-dose exposure (1-4 mg/kg, i.p.), induced hyperlocomotion, potentiated the preference for sucrose reward, increased resistance to punishment, and impaired place learning and its reversal. Comparable deficits were also observed after chronic treatments with Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) or morphine (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous). Mitragynine-, morphine-, and THC-induced learning and memory deficits were reversed by co-treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist, NIDA-41020 (10 mg/kg, i.p.). A significant upregulation of CB1 receptor expression was found in the hippocampal CA1 region and ventral tegmental area after chronic high-dose mitragynine and morphine, whereas a downregulation was observed after chronic THC. In conclusion, the present study suggests a plausible role of the CB1 receptor in mediating the dose-dependent cognitive deficits after chronic high-dose mitragynine exposure. This also highlights the potential of CB1 receptor antagonism in ameliorating the cognitive deficits associated with long-term kratom/mitragynine consumption in humans."

      "abstract": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa, Korth.) is an evergreen tree that is indigenous to Southeast Asia. When ingested, kratom leaves or decoctions from the leaves have been reported to produce complex stimulant and opioid-like effects. For generations, native populations in Southeast Asia have used kratom products to stave off fatigue, improve mood, alleviate pain and manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Despite the long history of kratom use in Asia, it is only within the past 10-20 years that kratom has emerged as an important herbal agent in the United States, where it is being used for the self-treatment of pain, opioid withdrawal symptoms, and mood disorders. The increase in the use of kratom in the United States has coincided with the serious epidemic of opioid abuse and dependence. Since 2015, efforts to restrict access to prescription opioids have resulted in a marked increase in the use of \"street\" opioids such as heroin and illicit fentanyl. At the same time, many patients with chronic pain conditions or opioid use disorder have been denied access to appropriate medical help. The lack of access to care for patients with chronic pain and opioid use disorder has been magnified by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this report, we highlight how these converging factors have led to a surge in interest in kratom as a potential harm reduction agent in the treatment of pain and opioid use disorder."

There has been a wide spectrum of negative effects including renal failure, liver failure, and cardiac toxicity. While some adverse effects have been reversed with medical intervention, others left more of a detrimental long-term impact not amenable to even the most invasive therapies. We present the case of a patient who was admitted to the intensive care unit after presenting with unresponsiveness secondary to a cerebrovascular accident, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure. The patient had begun using kratom, initially for recreational purposes, and later escalating it to abusive doses. The patient survived the episode after suffering many complications including transient reversible nonischemic cardiomyopathy and was discharged in a neurologically stable state; however, he ended up being hemodialysis-dependent at such an early age. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare complication of this herb that has not been well documented."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mitragynine, the major indole alkaloid from Mitragyna speciosa has been reported previously to possess abuse liability. However, there are insufficient data suggesting the mechanism through which this pharmacological agent causes addiction. AIMS: In this study, we investigated the effects of mitragynine on dopamine (DA) level and dopamine transporter (DAT) expression from the rat's frontal cortex. METHODS: DA level was recorded in the brain samples of animals treated with acute or repeated exposure for 4 consecutive days with either vehicle or mitragynine (1 and 30 mg/kg) using electrochemical sensor. Animals were then decapitated and the brain regions were removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately stored at -80 °C. DA level was quantified using Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and DAT gene expression was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS/OUTCOME: Mitragynine (1 and 30 mg/kg) did not increase DA release following acute treatment, however, after repeated exposure at day 4, mitragynine significantly and dose dependently increased DA release in the frontal cortex. In this study, we also observed a significant increase in DAT mRNA expression at day 4 in group treated with mitragynine (30 mg/kg). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Data from this study indicates that mitragynine significantly increased DA release when administered repeatedly, increased in DAT mRNA expression with the highest tested dose (30 mg/kg). Therefore, the rewarding effects observed after mitragynine administration could be due to its ability to increase DA content in certain areas of the brain especially the frontal cortex.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.) or kratom is a medicinal plant indigenous to Southeast Asia. The leaf of M. speciosa is used as a remedy in pain management including cancer related pain, in a similar way as opioids and cannabis. Despite its well-known analgesic effect, there is a scarce of information on the cancer-suppressing potential of M. speciosa and its active constituents. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the potential applicability of M. speciosa alkaloids (mitragynine, speciociliatine or paynantheine) as chemosensitizers for cisplatin in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of the extracts, fractions and compounds were determined by conducting in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Based on the cytotoxic screening, the alkaloid extract of M. speciosa exhibited potent inhibitory effect on the NPC cell line NPC/HK1, and therefore, was chosen for further fractionation and purification. NPC cell lines NPC/HK1 and C666-1 were treated with combinations of cisplatin and M. speciosa alkaloids combinations in 2D monolayer culture. The effect of cisplatin and mitragynine as a combination on cell migration was tested using in vitro wound healing and spheroid invasion assays. RESULTS: In our bioassay guided isolation, both methanolic and alkaloid extracts showed mild to moderate cytotoxic effect against the NPC/HK1 cell line. Both NPC cell lines (NPC/HK1 and C666-1) were insensitive to single agent and combination treatments of the M. speciosa alkaloids. However, mitragynine and speciociliatine sensitized the NPC/HK1 and C666-1 cells to cisplatin at ~4- and >5-fold, respectively in 2D monolayer culture. The combination of mitragynine and cisplatin also significantly inhibited cell migration of the NPC cell lines. Similarly, the combination also of mitragynine and cisplatin inhibited growth and invasion of NPC/HK1 spheroids in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the spheroids did not rapidly develop resistance to the drug combinations at higher concentrations over 10 days. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that both mitragynine and speciociliatine could be potential chemosensitizers for cisplatin. Further elucidation focusing on the drug mechanistic studies and in vivo studies are necessary to support delineate the therapeutic applicability of M. speciosa alkaloids for NPC treatment.",

It is used by some to attenuate opioid withdrawal and as a longer-term drug substitute. Most self-report data have come from online surveys, small in-person surveys, and case reports. These may not be representative of the broader kratom-using population. PURPOSE: Analyze user-generated social media posts to determine if independent, descriptive accounts are generally consistent with prior U.S. kratom survey findings and gain a more nuanced understanding of kratom use patterns. METHODS: Reddit posts mentioning kratom from 42 subreddits between June 2019-July 2020 were coded by two independent raters. FINDINGS: Relevant posts (number of comments, upvotes, and downvotes) from 1274 posts comprised the final sample (n = 280). Of the 1521 codes applied, 1273 (83.69%) were concordant. Desirable kratom effects were described among a majority, but so too were adverse effects. Reports of kratom as acute self-treatment for opioid withdrawal were more prominent compared to longer-term opioid substitution. Quantitative analysis found higher kratom doses associated (p < .001) with greater odds of reported kratom addiction (OR = 3.56) or withdrawal (OR = 5.88), with slightly lower odds of desirable effects (OR = 0.53, p = .014). Despite perceived therapeutic benefits, kratom was characterized by some in terms of addiction that, in some cases, appeared dose-dependent. Polydrug use was also prominently discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Results validated many prior survey findings while illustrating complexities of kratom use that are not being fully captured and require continued investigation.",

It has been used as a recreational and performance drug in Southeast Asia, and is now increasingly used in Europe and the U.S. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 63-year-old man who presented for treatment after his long-term Kratom use failed as a self-management for persistent major depression (ICD 10: F33.2) and a generalized anxiety disorder (ICD-10: F41.1). The failure coincided with emerging stress at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient suffered from childhood on from ruminative thinking and depressive mood, which was treated in several settings during his life. He started to use alcohol to control his depression, but developed an alcohol addiction. This was successfully treated and the patient remained abstinent for more than 25 years afterwards. About 7 years ago, he started to use Kratom 3-4 times daily on a regular, but constant rate. Kratom use worked efficiently as a self-management of his depression with no escalation of dosing. It was also very effective in reducing Morbus Menière symptoms of tinnitus and sudden hearing loss, which eventually allowed regular performance as a caregiver in a demanding job on shift-work. During recently increased stress load in the work environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, the established Kratom doses failed to control hyperarousal and mental nervousness. The patient was treatment seeking and subsequently detoxified from Kratom. Anxiety- and depression management was shifted to treatment attempts with Lorazepam, Venlafaxine, Opipramol, Mirtazapine and psychotherapy. CONCLUSION: Kratom instrumentalization for self-management of depression and anxiety may effectively work without causing escalation of drug use and addiction, but may be limited by a temporary increase in psychological stress load and a relapse into major depression and generalized anxiety disorder."

The potential for additive liver toxicity must be considered when kratom is used concurrently with hepatotoxic, over-the-counter, herbal, and prescription medications. This case report describes a case of kratom-induced liver inflammation complicated by opioid withdrawal that was precipitated by initiation of IM naltrexone. To our knowledge, there are no published case reports related to opioid withdrawal following naltrexone administration in patients using kratom (without other opioids). The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate potential complications that may arise with kratom use and considerations that should be taken prior to initiation of naltrexone in kratom users."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a popular plant-based extract that has dose-dependent stimulatory and sedative effects. It has been used for self-treatment of opioid withdrawal and can result in seizures, hepatotoxicity, and infectious complications from bacterial contamination. Reports of morbidity and mortality associated with Kratom may be confounded by coingestants. We report a case of severe rhabdomyolysis and pressure necrosis leading to fasciotomy in a patient who was using Kratom. CASE REPORT: A 31-year-old male with substance use presented to the emergency department after loss of consciousness for 6 hours after smoking Kratom. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, acute renal and hepatic injury, and electrolyte disturbances. No ethanol was detected, and urine drug screen was negative. Over the next 3 hours, the patient developed signs of compartment syndrome and he was transferred to the operating room for fasciotomy. He required continuous renal replacement therapy for 48 hours and his labs and clinical status improved. He was discharged 18 days later. A serum and urine sample from the first day of presentation were analyzed for mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine using an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometer (UPLC-MSMS) method. The serum mitragynine was 5 ng/mL and the urine mitragynine 6 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are numerous reports of opioids resulting in prolonged periods of immobilization and rhabdomyolysis, this is not commonly reported in Kratom overdoses.This case report highlights the profound sedative effect of Kratom and the potential of pressure necrosis injury resulting in rhabdomyolysis and compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of Americans are turning to kratom for self-management of various pain, anxiety, and mood states and as an opioid substitute. Addiction to this unique botanical develops and carries a high relapse risk and, to date, there are no guidelines on how to maintain long-term abstinence. The aim of this article is to compile all available information on management of \"kratom use disorder\" (KUD)-as coined here-from the literature, with evidence from the clinical practice of expert addictionologists in an attempt to develop a standard of care consensus. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to capture all relevant cases pertaining to maintenance treatment for KUD. Results were supplemented with case reports and scientific posters gleaned from reliable online sources and conference proceedings. Additionally, a survey of members of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) was administered to assess the practice patterns of experts who treat patients with KUD in isolation of a comorbid opioid use disorder (OUD). RESULTS: Based on a literature review, 14 reports exist of long-term management of KUD, half of which do not involve a comorbid OUD. Pharmacological modalities utilized include mostly buprenorphine but also a few cases of naltrexone and methadone, all with favorable outcomes. This is supported by the results of the expert survey, which demonstrated that those who have managed KUD in isolation of a comorbid OUD reported having utilized buprenorphine (89.5%), as well as the other medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive review to examine the existing literature referring to management of KUD in combination with a survey of current experts' clinical consensus regarding pharmacological management. Based on this information, it seems reasonable that the indication for MOUD should be extended to cases of moderate to severe KUD.",

      "abstract": "Kratom or Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.) is an evergreen tree of the coffee family native to South-East Asia and Australasia. It is used by locals recreationally to induce stimulant and sedative effects and medically to soothe pain and opiate withdrawal. Its leaves are smoked, chewed, or infused, or ground to yield powders or extracts for use as liquids. It contains more than 40 alkaloids; among these, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are endowed with variable mu, delta, and kappa opioid stimulating properties (with 7-hydroxymitragynine having a more balanced affinity), rhynchophylline, which is a non-competitive NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, but is present in negligible quantities, and raubasine, which inhibits α1-adrenceptors preferentially over α2-adrenceptors, while the latter are bound by 7-hydroxymitragynine, while mitragynine counters 5-HT2A receptors. This complexity of neurochemical mechanisms may account for kratom's sedative-analgesic and stimulant effects. It is commonly held that kratom at low doses is stimulant and at higher doses sedative, but no cut-off has been possible to define. Long-term use of kratom may produce physical and psychological effects that are very similar to its withdrawal syndrome, that is, anxiety, irritability, mood, eating, and sleep disorders, other than physical symptoms resembling opiate withdrawal. Kratom's regulatory status varies across countries; in Italy, both mitragynine and the entire tree and its parts are included among regulated substances. We describe the case of a patient who developed anxiety and dysphoric mood and insomnia while using kratom, with these symptoms persisting after withdrawal. He did not respond to a variety of antidepressant combinations and tramadol for various months, and responded after 1 month of clomipramine. Well-being persisted after discontinuing tramadol."

      "abstract": "Background: Kratom is a substance that when ingested produces an opioid-like effect. As kratom continues to gain popularity, increasing numbers of cases of addiction, dependence, and adverse events have been reported, as well as an increase in mortality associated with its use. George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center has been using buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of kratom withdrawal and dependence in both primary care and specialty addiction treatment settings in the Veteran population. Cases: We present three cases that describe the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for kratom dependence. For each case, we describe the withdrawal symptoms from kratom, induction and long-term maintenance on buprenorphine/naloxone in kratom dependence, the impact of polysubstance use disorders in management of kratom dependence, and the use of urine drug screens for kratom alkaloids during treatment. Discussion: This case series demonstrates that patients with kratom dependence can effectively be treated with buprenorphine/naloxone. It appears that it is safe to induce buprenorphine/naloxone as early as eight hours after last kratom use and maintenance dosing for kratom use was similar to maintenance doses used in opioid use disorder. Prolonged and continued withdrawal symptoms were reported despite treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone and multiple daily doses of up to 24mg per day may be beneficial for prolonged withdrawal symptoms and for cooccurring pain. Polysubstance use with kratom dependence may require higher levels of care and higher doses of buprenorphine/naloxone. Urine drug screens may be best practice for monitoring kratom alkaloids concentrations and facilities that utilize buprenorphine/naloxone to treat kratom dependence should have testing available. Further research is needed on the impact and the treatment of kratom dependence.",

      "abstract": "Kratom is widely consumed in the United States for self-treatment of pain and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Mitragynine is the most abundant alkaloid in kratom and is a μ-opioid receptor agonist. 7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG) is a mitragynine metabolite that is a more potent and efficacious opioid than its parent mitragynine. 7-HMG contributes to mitragynine's antinociceptive effects in mice, but evidence suggests it may also have a higher abuse potential. This in vitro study demonstrates that 7-HMG is stable in rodent and monkey plasma but is unstable in human plasma. Surprisingly, in human plasma 7-HMG is converted to mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, an opioid that is even more potent than either mitragynine or 7-HMG. This novel metabolite is formed in human plasma to a much greater extent than in the preclinical species tested (mouse, rat, dog, and cynomolgus monkey) and due to its μ-opioid potency may substantially contribute to the pharmacology of kratom in humans to a greater extent than in other tested species."

The number of kratom users outside of Southeast Asia has increased significantly in recent decades with use spreading to the Unites States (US) and Europe. Because of its reputed opioid-like psychoactive effects at higher doses, kratom has been regulated in several countries and is subject to an import ban by the US Food and Drug Administration. Nonetheless, in the US it is estimated that 10-15 million people consume kratom primarily for the self-treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, to mitigate withdrawal from or dependence on opioids, and to self-treat opioid use disorder or other substance use disorders (SUDs). Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage in the supply of kratom products may place unexpected burdens on kratom users, potentially influencing some who use kratom for SUD self-treatment to regress to harmful drug use, hence increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes, including overdose. Inadequate treatment, treatment barriers, and increases in the sales of adulterated kratom products on the internet or in convenience stores could exacerbate circumstances further. Although there are currently no verified indications of kratom scarcity, researchers and clinicians should be aware of and remain vigilant to this unanticipated possibility."

      "abstract": "The safety and efficacy of kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) for treatment of pain is highly controversial. Kratom produces more than 40 structurally related alkaloids, but most studies have focused on just two of these, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Here, we profiled 53 commercial kratom products using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics, revealing two distinct chemotypes that contain different levels of the alkaloid speciofoline. Both chemotypes were confirmed with DNA barcoding to be M. speciosa. To evaluate the biological relevance of variable speciofoline levels in kratom, we compared the opioid receptor binding activity of speciofoline, mitragynine, and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine function as partial agonists of the human µ-opioid receptor, while speciofoline does not exhibit measurable binding affinity at the µ-, δ- or ƙ-opioid receptors. Importantly, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine demonstrate functional selectivity for G-protein signaling, with no measurable recruitment of β-arrestin. Overall, the study demonstrates the unique binding and functional profiles of the kratom alkaloids, suggesting potential utility for managing pain, but further studies are needed to follow up on these in vitro findings. All three kratom alkaloids tested inhibited select cytochrome P450 enzymes, suggesting a potential risk for adverse interactions when kratom is co-consumed with drugs metabolized by these enzymes.",

Kratom has been used as a substitute for opium in physically-dependent subjects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antinociception, somatic and physical dependence produced by kratom tea, and then assess if the tea ameliorated withdrawal in opioid physically-dependent subjects. METHODS: Lyophilized kratom tea (LKT) was evaluated in C57BL/6J and opioid receptor knockout mice after oral administration. Antinociceptive activity was measured in the 55 °C warm-water tail-withdrawal assay. Potential locomotor impairment, respiratory depression and locomotor hyperlocomotion, and place preference induced by oral LKT were assessed in the rotarod, Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System, and conditioned place preference assays, respectively. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal was used to determine potential physical dependence in mice repeatedly treated with saline or escalating doses of morphine or LKT, and LKT amelioration of morphine withdrawal. Data were analyzed using one- and two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Oral administration of LKT resulted in dose-dependent antinociception (≥1 g/kg, p.o.) absent in mice lacking the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and reduced in mice lacking the kappa-opioid receptor. These doses of LKT did not alter coordinated locomotion or induce conditioned place preference, and only briefly reduced respiration. Repeated administration of LKT did not produce physical dependence, but significantly decreased naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine dependent mice. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the MOR agonist activity and therapeutic effect of LKT for the treatment of pain and opioid physical dependence.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Some opioid use disorder (OUD) patients attempt to self-treat using herbal remedies such as kratom. However, kratom use itself can paradoxically cause physical dependence and OUD. Currently, there are no guidelines for treating patients with OUD stemming from kratom use. Our empirically-based hypothesis was that there would be a correlation between the amount of kratom used and the amount of buprenorphine-naloxone required for opioid agonist therapy. METHODS: This study includes a systematic review assessing treatment of kratom-dependent patients with buprenorphine-naloxone; a case series of our kratom-dependent patients; calculation of the correlation between the kratom dose and the buprenorphine-naloxone dose required to treat kratom-associated OUD; and our proposed starting doses for using buprenorphine-naloxone to treat kratom OUD. RESULTS: The OVID MEDLINE (1946-2020) database was searched using the terms \"kratom,\" \"buprenorphine,\" and \"case report.\" This search yielded 3 relevant cases of patients having kratom OUD who were treated with buprenorphine-naloxone with the amounts of all substances reported. Review of the bibliographies, citing articles, and Google Scholar turned up three additional cases, yielding 6 literature cases that were analyzed. We also analyzed 2 patients from our clinic, giving a total of 8 patients included in the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation. We found a strong correlation of 0.84 between these variables, consistent with our hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our analysis, patients using <20 g of kratom/d could be initiated on opioid agonist therapy with 4/1 mg-8/2 mg buprenorphine-naloxone/d, while patients using kratom doses >40 g/d could be initiated with 12/3 mg-16/4 mg of buprenorphine-naloxone/day.",

      "abstract": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa, Korth) is a tree-like plant that is indigenous to Southeast Asia. Kratom leaf products have been used in traditional folk medicine for their unique combination of stimulant and opioid-like effects. Kratom is being increasingly used in the West for its reputed benefits in the treatment of pain, depression and opioid use disorder. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control have raised concerns regarding the contamination of some kratom products with toxic metals (Pb and Ni) and microbes such as Salmonella. To further explore this issue, eight different kratom products were legally purchased from various \"head\"/\"smoke\" shops in the Western Suburbs of Chicago and then tested for microbial burden, a panel of metals (Ni, Pb, Cr, As, Hg, Cd), and levels of the main psychoactive alkaloid mitragynine. All of the samples contained significant, but variable, levels of mitragynine (3.9-62.1 mg/g), indicating that the products were, in fact, derived from kratom. All but two of the samples tested positive for the presence of various microbes including bacteria and fungi. However, none of the samples tested positive for Salmonella. Seven products showed significant levels of Ni (0.73-7.4 µg/g), Pb (0.16-1.6 µg/g) and Cr (0.21-5.7 µg/g) while the other product was negative for metals. These data indicate that many kratom products contain variable levels of mitragynine and can contain significant levels of toxic metals and microbes. These findings highlight the need for more stringent standards for the production and sale of kratom products.",
