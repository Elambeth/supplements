      "abstract": "The deterioration of fruit quality during refrigeration is a typical symptom of the storage and transportation of Lycium barbarum L. (wolfberry) fruit after harvest. This study aimed to explore the impact of melatonin (MT) treatment on the fruit quality of wolfberry stored at 4°C, using combined transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses. In this study, about 15% of the flavonoid metabolites differed significantly after MT treatment in yellow-fleshed wolfberry, especially for flavanols, flavanones, and flavonols. MT treatment enhanced esterified carotenoid content in red-fleshed wolfberry postharvest. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that MT-induced upregulation of LbaF3'H, LbaHQT and LbaCHS1 might contribute to the increased flavonoids in yellow-flesh wolfberry, and that MT-induced upregulation of LbaPSY, LbaCRTISO and LbaCYCB are responsible for the increased carotenoids in red-flesh wolfberry. Coexpression network analysis showed that several transcription factors such as LbaGATA are involved in MT-mediated regulation of flavonoids and carotenoids. Dual luciferase assay evidenced that LbaGATA and LbaRKD5 depress the expression of LbaPSY. Overall, this study underscores MT's role in maintaining wolfberry postharvest quality during storage, providing a solid foundation of food application.",

      "abstract": "The constantly expanding functional food market has steered scientific research towards alternative sources of bioactive compounds. Red yeasts are valuable producers of active ingredients such as carotenoids and microbial oil. Efficient and sustainable recovery methods are required when food applications are targeted. In this study, intracellular carotenoids and oil synthesized by Rhodosporidium paludigenum in batch bioreactor cultures were recovered using supercritical CO2 (SFE-CO2) as a green alternative to conventional organic solvents. Yeast biomass was subjected to six different cell disruption methods prior to SFE-CO2. Homogenization emerged as the optimal pre-treatment method, resulting in an 80 % yield of total carotenoids and an 83 % yield of microbial oil. The use of ethanol as co-solvent was imperative for the efficient recovery of both products. β-Carotene was the main carotenoid, while the obtained microbial oil was rich in oleic acid. These results pave the way for integrating these functional compounds into innovative food products."

      "abstract": "In this study, carotenoids from four different paprika genotypes were analyzed at various maturation stages, as well as in Ajvar, a traditional Balkan product made from fully matured roasted paprika fruits. For this purpose, the HPTLC analytical method was used, and five dominant carotenoids were analyzed: β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, capsanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin. Additionally, total carotenoids were analyzed spectrophotometrically, antioxidant capacity was determined, and their bioavailability was assayed using in vitro digestion. Finally, Raman spectroscopy, a non-destructive analytical method, was used to estimate the total carotenoid content. The results showed that the amount of all investigated carotenoids is the highest in the final maturity stage (0.38 g/100 g DM to 1.55 g/100 g DM). On the other hand, the lowest concentration of all investigated carotenoids was detected at the first stage of maturation, ranging from 0.01 g/100 g DM to 0.25 g/100 g DM. However, the analysis of carotenoid content in Ajvar showed a tendency for a decrease in concentration compared to their quantity in fresh fruits, although this was also dependent on the genotype (1.9-66.98% according to HPTLC results and 16.14-82.36% according to spectrophotometry). Antioxidant tests indicated an increase in antioxidant capacity with the ripening of paprika fruits, confirming the role of carotenoids as compounds capable of neutralizing harmful oxygen species (DPPH ranged from 0.21 to 1.50 µmol/g TEAC, CUPRAC ranged from 0.185 to 0.297 mg AsA/g DM, FRP ranged from 9.33 to 25.66 mg AsA/g DM). Quantification of total carotenoids by Raman spectroscopy showed that results were highly correlated with those obtained by HPTLC and the spectrophotometric method, highlighting the potential of Raman spectroscopy for carotenoid quantification. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the traditional product Ajvar represents an important source of carotenoids, which are preserved after heat treatment with high biological activity relative to the final ripening stage of the paprika. Furthermore, the bioavailability of carotenoids from Ajvar is significantly higher compared to the results from fresh paprika analysis."

      "abstract": "Background: Carotenoids are bioactive tetraterpenoid C40 pigments that are actively synthesized by plants, bacteria, and fungi. Compounds such as α-carotene, β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, astaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, fucoxanthin, and zeaxanthin have attracted increasing attention for their antiaging properties. They exhibit antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases. Objectives: The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the pharmacological potential and biological mechanisms of carotenoids associated with age-related disorders and to evaluate their application in nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and cosmeceuticals. Methods: A systematic review of studies published over the past two decades was conducted using the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The selection criteria included clinical, in silico, in vivo, and in vitro studies investigating the pharmacological and therapeutic effects of carotenoids. Results: Carotenoids demonstrate a variety of health benefits, including the prevention of age-related macular degeneration, cancer, cognitive decline, metabolic disorders, and skin aging. Their role in nutraceuticals is well supported by their ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. In pharmaceuticals, carotenoids show promising results in formulations targeting neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. In cosmeceuticals, they improve skin health by protecting it against UV radiation and oxidative damage. However, bioavailability, optimal dosages, toxicity, and interactions with other bioactive compounds remain critical factors to maximize therapeutic efficacy and still require careful evaluation by scientists. Conclusions: Carotenoids are promising bioactive compounds for antiaging interventions with potential applications in a variety of fields. Further research is needed to optimize their formulas, improve bioavailability, and confirm their long-term safety and effectiveness, especially in the aging population."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) with high yield and diverse nutrients, is the third most important food crop in the world. Manganese (Mn) is an essential cofactor that plays a critical role in the development and maturation of the crop. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the sweet potato response to Mn remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, Mn treatment increased the depth of yellow color in sweet potato, augmented sugar and carotenoid accumulation in storage roots, accompanied with a decline in plant hormones. Especially, Mn-treated storage roots displayed more than a 200% increase in β-carotene content compared to the control, while the abscisic acid (ABA) content was reduced by at least 50%. An integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis suggested that Mn application regulated transcriptional and metabolic profiles of carotenoid biosynthesis, soluble sugar, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and biosynthesis of amino acids. Further study revealed that Mn treatment stimulated β-carotene accumulation in storage roots by up-regulation of the transcripts of GGPPS, ZIDS, LCYB and OR, along with down-regulation of CCD1 and CCD4. Moreover, Mn application reduced ABA content through preventing the expression of NCED1. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that Mn, emerging as an agrochemical candidate, will meet agricultural challenges by not only enriching the flesh coloration but also augmenting the nutritional value of sweet potatoes. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "Two pretreatments (ultrasound sonication [US] and microwave [MW]) and drying techniques (hot air [HA] and freeze-drying [FD]) were used to assess the in vitro bioaccessibility of phenols, carotenoids, and antioxidant activity in three tomato cultivars (Zzx171, Zzx162, and Zzx65). The metabolome-chemometric analysis showed that tomato cultivars dried by FD and HA differed in metabolites. HA samples contained methoxytyrosine and aconitane-type diterpenoids. US-HA enhanced total phenol content bioaccessibility by 64.72%-74.25% in three tomato cultivars after digestion (intestinal phase). US-HA increased the protocatechuic acid levels in all three tomato cultivars in the intestinal phase, but by 55.23% in Zzx65 compared to the undigested samples. Despite all adopted postharvest pretreatments and drying, US-HA retained chlorogenic acid, 4-O-caffeinyliquinic acid, and rutin better, due to microstructure changes in the intestinal phase, and Zzx65 treated with US-HA retained the most. In undigested samples, US-FD improved total carotenoids, lycopene, and β-carotene retention, but the inaccessibility was reduced significantly during in vitro digestion. Cultivar × postharvest treatment affected all phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and antioxidant activities in the intestinal phase. US-HA had improved antioxidant power (FRAP) and 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) scavenging activity in the intestinal phase. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Tomatoes are an important part of the human diet. Their high perishability reduces their nutritional and microbiological quality. The lack of cold storage infrastructure in developing countries contributes to food waste. Convective hot air drying is suitable for recycling fresh market waste products as supplement powders. The ultrasound pretreatment protects bioactive compounds in tomato fruit and is non-thermal. There are several limitations, including equipment cost, energy efficiency, and integration with commercial systems, which limit ultrasound-assisted drying's scalability. The integration of US-HA treatment (ultrasound-assisted hot air drying) could reduce food waste and contribute to the sustainable development goals in agricultural industries.",

The bacterial strain was isolated, and its carotenoids profile was analyzed via HPLC-DAD-MS. Cytotoxicity, migration tests and the expression of BAX and BCL-2 at the gene and protein levels were carried out to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of the produced carotenoids. Molecular docking analysis estimated the binding affinity between zeaxanthin and BCL-2 protein. Chromatographic analysis revealed zeaxanthin as the major carotenoid (48.3%). The extract exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells with an IC50 of 1200 µg. It notably reduced cell migration, with wound closure percentages of 37.50% and 79.17% for the 600 µg group, while the percentages were 12.50% and 53.50% for the 1200 µg group, compared to 71.67% and 95.67% for the control at 24 and 48 h post-treatment, respectively. The extract induced apoptosis, as evidenced by significantly increased BAX/BCL-2 gene expression ratios at 600 and 1200 µg (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed increased BAX protein expression at 600 and 1200 µg compared to the control group (p < 0.001), and significantly lower BCL-2 protein expression (p = 0.000005 for 1200 µg and p = 0.0001 for 600 µg). Docking analysis indicated a strong affinity of zeaxanthin to BCL-2 (ΔG = -9.773241 kcal/mol) compared to obatoclax (ΔG = -7.419345 kcal/mol). Paracoccus sp. EGY7 carotenoids are a promising anticancer agent against MDA-MB-231 cells. They effectively promote apoptosis and prevent metastasis, crucial for disease advancement in cancer cells."

      "abstract": "Paprika, obtained from dried red pepper (C. annuum), is valued for its characteristic colour and flavour. Its carotenoid content, which is important for both sensory and nutritional quality, varies depending on several factors (agronomic conditions and technological treatment with special attention to the drying methods) that influence the colour and antioxidant capacity of the samples. This study investigated the effect of an accelerated thermal treatment (80 °C for 8 h) applied to evaluate the oxidative stability of the carotenoids and the colour of ground paprika depending on its origin (Peru or China). Changes in quality parameters (ASTA index and CIELAB colour), carotenoid content and profile (HPLC-DAD) and lipophilic antioxidant capacity (FRAP and ABTS•+ methods) were evaluated. Untreated Chinese samples had 30% more total carotenoids than Peruvian samples, but this was not reflected in ASTA units, indicating that at least a 50% carotenoid variation is required for significant differences. Treatment resulted in a carotenoid loss of 70% in Peruvian and 30% in Chinese samples, with changes in total carotenoids correlating positively with antioxidant capacity. Both origins had similar carotenoid profiles, with β-carotene being the predominant carotenoid, while distinct contents were observed between the origins. The higher content of esterified carotenoids in Chinese peppers resulted in better thermal stability. The results highlight the necessity for tailored production processes to maintain nutritional integrity and antioxidant capacity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the impact of serum carotenoids, a class of compounds having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, on migraine. This study aimed to examine the association between serum carotenoid levels and migraine risk among United States adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 7744 individuals aged 20 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2001 and 2004. The concentrations of five serum carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein + zeaxanthin) and retinol were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Migraine was diagnosed when participants reported that they had severe headaches or migraines during the past three months. Weighted multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models were used to determine the association between serum carotenoid levels and migraine risk. RESULTS: Among the 7744 participants enrolled in the study, 1595 (20.6%) had migraine. Compared with the lowest quartiles, the highest quartiles of the three serum carotenoids were associated with a lower risk of migraine, with a multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.97) for α-carotene, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.49-0.83) for β-carotene, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.53-0.78) for lutein + zeaxanthin, while the third quartile of serum β-cryptoxanthin had lower odds of migraine (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90). The U-shaped patterns of nonlinear relationships between serum β-cryptoxanthin and lutein + zeaxanthin levels and migraine risk were represented by restricted cubic splines. No association was observed between serum lycopene and retinol levels and migraine. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum carotenoid levels were associated with an increased risk of migraine. Further prospective investigations are warranted to clarify the causative relationship and explore the possible prevention and treatment of migraine using carotenoid supplementation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Carotenoids are naturally occurring pigments in plants and are responsible for the orange, yellow, and red color of fruits and vegetables. Carrots are one of the primary dietary sources of carotenoids. The biological activities of carotenoids in higher organisms, including their immunomodulatory activities, are well documented in most tissues but not the large intestine. The gastrointestinal barrier acts as a line of defense against the systemic invasion of pathogenic bacteria, especially at the colonic level. METHODS: To test whether carotenoids in orange carrots can alleviate obesity-associated gut inflammation and strengthen the intestinal barrier function, male C57BL/6J mice were randomized to one of four experimental diets for 20 weeks (n = 20 animals/group): Low-fat diet (LFD, 10% calories from fat), high-fat diet (HFD, 45% calories from fat), HFD with white carrot powder (HFD+WC), or HFD with orange carrot powder (HFD + OC). Colon tissues were harvested to analyze the biochemical effects of carotenoids in carrots. The distal sections were subjected to isobaric labeling-based quantitative proteomics in which tryptic peptides were labeled with tandem mass tags, followed by fractionation and LC-MS/MS analysis in an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid instrument. RESULTS: High-performance liquid chromatography results revealed that the HFD+WC pellets were carotenoid-deficient, and the HFD+OC pellets contained high concentrations of provitamin A carotenoids, specifically α-carotene and β-carotene. As a result of the quantitative proteomics, a total of 4410 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Intestinal barrier-associated proteins were highly upregulated in the HFD+OC group, particularly mucin-2 (MUC-2). Upon closer investigation into mucosal activity, other proteins related to MUC-2 functionality and tight junction management were upregulated by the HFD+OC dietary intervention. DISCUSSION: Collectively, our findings suggest that carotenoid-rich foods can prevent high-fat diet-induced intestinal barrier disruption by promoting colonic mucus synthesis and secretion in mammalian organisms. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD054150."

      "abstract": "Despite the advancement in cancer diagnosis and treatment, colorectal cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Given the high recurrence rate of colorectal cancer even after surgical resection, chemotherapy has been clinically used to improve the treatment outcomes of colorectal cancer. However, chemotherapy is well-known for its toxic side effects. Thus, phytochemicals have been widely studied in recent years as preventive and therapeutic agents for colorectal cancer owing to their relatively low toxicity. Moreover, combinatorial uses of phytochemicals with other natural compounds or with drugs may amplify the positive outcomes of colorectal cancer prevention and treatment by intervening in multiple signaling pathways and targets. This review summarized the combinatorial use of several well-studied groups of phytochemicals, that is, isothiocyanates, quinones, carotenoids, and alkaloids, in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, and suggested it as a potential approach to improve the anticancer efficacy of single compounds and minimize the toxic side effects associated with conventional drugs. Notably, we generalized the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical experiments-based molecular mechanisms whereby the selected phytochemicals in combination with other compounds exerted anti-colorectal cancer effects by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cell invasion, and tumor growth.

      "abstract": "The anticancer, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties of carotenoids from saffron or apocarotenoids (e.g., crocin, safranal, crocetin, and picrocrocin) have prompted research into their benefits. Apocarotenoids seem to be effective compound for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, cancer, respiratory, and metabolic disorders. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells that participates in the biosynthesis of proteins, lipids, and steroid hormones. Given the role of the ER in the regulation of several fundamental biological processes, including metabolic pathways and immune responses, aberrant ER function can have a significant influence on these vital processes and result in serious pathological consequences. Exposure of cell to adverse environmental challenges, such as toxic agents, ischemia, and so on, causes accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, also called ER stress. There is a growing evidence to suggest that ER disturbance in the form of oxidative/nitrosative stress and subsequent apoptotic cell death plays major roles in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, and liver diseases. Apocarotenoids with their unique properties can modulate ER stress through PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP (protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2α/activating transcription factor 4/C/EBP /homologous protein) and X-Box Binding Protein 1/activating transcription factor 6 (XBP1/ATF6) pathways. In addition, they suppress apoptosis through inhibition of endoplasmic and mitochondrial-dependent caspase cascade and can stimulate SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1) and Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) expression, thereby leading to protection against oxidative stress. This review summarizes the potential benefits of apocarotenoids in various ER-stress-related disorders."

      "abstract": "Cancer progression is primarily driven by the uncontrolled activation of cellular signaling pathways, with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (PAMT) pathway playing a central role. This pathway significantly contributes to the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, and its hyperactivity is a major challenge in managing several types of malignancies. This article delves into the promising potential of carotenoids, natural pigments found in abundance in fruits and vegetables, as a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. By specifically targeting and inhibiting the PAMT pathway, carotenoids may effectively disrupt the growth and survival of cancer cells. The article examines the complex mechanisms underlying these interactions and highlights the obstacles faced in cancer treatment. It proposes a compelling approach to developing therapies that leverage natural products to target this critical pathway, offering a fresh perspective on cancer treatment. Further research is essential to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of these compounds.",

Non-invasive skin carotenoid concentration measurements may provide a rapid assessment of toddler carotenoid and carotenoid-rich FV intake. background OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pressure-mediated reflection spectroscopy-measured skin carotenoid scores (SCSs) with proxy-reported carotenoid and FV intake in racially and ethnically diverse, US toddlers. DESIGN: This study was a secondary analysis of data obtained from a randomized, controlled 10-week study of the effect of an interactive healthy playgroup intervention versus classroom parent education on the diet and physical activity of toddlers. This study collected skin carotenoid and 1-week dietary intake using a 31-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire analyzed by Nutrient Data System for Research nutrient database. The current study determined dietary predictors of toddler SCSs. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were racially and ethnically diverse toddlers (12-36 months) and adult guardian dyads (N=50) recruited from the community in Houston, TX from Fall 2018-Spring 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline and 10-12 weeks after baseline, SCSs were measured by pressure-mediated reflection spectroscopy (Veggie Meter (TM)), guardians reported toddler diet using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and carotenoid intake was estimated from the FFQ responses using a nutrient database. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The relationship between toddler SCSs and intake of total and individual carotenoid species, and FV servings was tested using generalized linear mixed models, controlling for BMI-for-age percentiles, group assignment, and age. RESULTS: SCSs were positively and significantly predicted by estimated intakes of total carotenoids (p=0.002), beta-carotene (p=<0.001), and lutein & zeaxanthin (p=0.003). Reported intakes of alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene were not predictors of SCS. Skin carotenoid scores were predicted by estimated total FV intake (p=0.047) and vegetable intake (p=0.006), but not fruit intake (p=0.580). results CONCLUSION: These results showed that reported dietary carotenoid intake is a significant predictor of SCSs in an ethnically and racially diverse population of toddlers. Toddler skin carotenoid measurement holds promise as a rapid, objective, non-invasive biomarker of dietary carotenoid intake."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Maternal diet modifies profiles of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), carotenoids, and polyphenols in human milk (HM). However, substantial variability in profiles exists between women, highlighting the complexity of non-dietary factors modulating these profiles. The objective of this study was to carry out a secondary analysis exploring the effect of maternal diet on HM carotenoids and polyphenols and relationships between dietary modulation of HM bioactives (carotenoids, polyphenols, and oligosaccharides) and maternal α1,2-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) secretor phenotype. METHODS: In this pilot study, 16 exclusively breastfeeding women with obesity were enrolled between 4 and 5 months postpartum. The women were provided a 4-week meal plan consistent with the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). HM was collected for 24 h at baseline and post-intervention. Maternal FUT2 secretor phenotype was determined by 2'-fucosyllactose concentration in HM (non-secretor: < 100 nmol/ml; secretor: ≥100 nmol/ml). Concentrations of carotenoids and HMOs were determined by LC and polyphenol metabolites by UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Thirteen women completed the study (6 secretors, 7 non-secretors). The change in HM concentrations of the HMOs lacto-N-tetraose (LNT, p = 0.007), lacto-N-fucopentaose II (LNFP II, p = 0.02), difucosyllacto-N-tetraose (DFLNT, p = 0.003), and disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT, p = 0.003) and polyphenol metabolites 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA, p = 0.08) and ferulic acid (p = 0.02) over the intervention time frame was differentially associated with maternal secretor status. 4-HBA and ferulic acid positively correlated with HMOs LNT and DSLNT (rrm = 0.82-0.90, p = 0.03-0.06) for secretors but not for non-secretors. Only secretors demonstrated a negative correlation between 4-HBA and DFLNT (rrm = -0.94, p = 0.001). DISCUSSION: The influence of maternal diet on composition of HMOs and polyphenol metabolites in HM differs based on maternal secretor status. Consideration of non-dietary factors is needed to evaluate differences in response of HM bioactives to dietary modulation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumption of tomatoes and tomato carotenoids is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Prostate tissue accumulates tomato carotenoids, including lycopene, β-carotene, and phytoene. Phytoene accumulation is relatively greater in the prostate than that of lycopene, but the metabolic determinants of tissue carotenoid profiles are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine if differences in stability, cellular uptake, and clearance of phytoene compared with lycopene or β-carotene by prostate and intestinal cells may explain differences in observed tissue carotenoid profiles. METHODS: Gene and protein expression for carotenoid metabolism in prostate cell lines were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Uptake, efflux, and clearance of phytoene, lycopene, or β-carotene by prostate cell [LNCaP (Lymph Node Carcinoma of the Prostate cell line), RWPE-1 (a human prostate epithelial cell line), and PC-3 (aprostate cancer cell line)] and absorptive enterocyte (Caco-2) cultures were compared. The effect of scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) inhibition on carotenoid uptake by LNCaP, RWPE-1, and Caco-2 cells was tested. RESULTS: SCARB1 was expressed across prostate cell lines. Lycopene, phytoene, and β-carotene uptakes were similar in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, whereas RWPE-1 cells absorbed a smaller portion of the phytoene dose than lycopene or β-carotene doses. The clearance rates of carotenoids from LNCaP cells did not differ. Intestinal cell uptake of phytoene was greatest, followed by β-carotene and lycopene. SCARBI inhibitor treatment did not significantly reduce the uptake or efflux of carotenoids by LNCaP or Caco-2 cells at the dose concentration provided. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study suggests that greater bioavailability at the point of the intestine and greater stability of phytoene are determinants of the relative enrichment of phytoene in prostate tissue.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to optimize the production of carotenoid pigments from Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341) through the statistical screening of media components and the characterization of antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytogenetic and cytotoxic activities. A BOX-Behnken design was used to assess the effects of whey concentration, inoculum size, pH, temperature, and agitation speed on carotenoid yield. The optimum combination increased production to 2.19 g/L, with a productivity of 0.045 g L-1 h-1 and a productivity yield of 0.644 g/g, as confirmed by an observed carotene production of 2.19 g/L. The final response surface model fitting the data had an R2 of 0.9461. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis identified 12 carotenoid pigment compounds produced by M. luteus. The extracts displayed moderate antimicrobial efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), and E. faecalis (ATCC 19433), with inhibition zone diameters (IZD) of 29.0, 14.0, and 37.0 mm, respectively, at 1000 μg/mL. However, its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria is limited. In comparison, tetracycline exhibited greater antimicrobial potency. The IC50 value of carotenoids was used to indicate the antioxidant activity. IC50 value from the DPPH assay was 152.80 mg/100mL. An IC50 cytotoxicity value greater than 300 μg/mL was found against normal mouse liver cells, with over 68% cell viability even at 300 μg/mL, indicating low toxicity. Histological structure studies revealed normal myocardial muscle tissue, lung tissue, and kidney tissue sections, whereas liver tissue sections revealed ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes and disorganization of hepatic cords. Cytogenetic parameters revealed that the carotene treatment group had a mitotic index (70%) lower than that of the control but higher than that of the positive control, mitomycin, and did not substantially increase numerical (1.2%) or structural aberrations compared with those of the control, suggesting a lack of genotoxic effects under the experimental conditions. In conclusion, optimized culture conditions enhanced carotenoid yields from M. luteus, and the extracts displayed promising bioactivity as moderate antibiotics against certain gram-positive bacteria and as antioxidants. The high IC50 values demonstrate biosafety. Overall, this bioprocess for enhanced carotenoid production coupled with bioactivity profiling and low cytotoxicity support the application of M. luteus carotenoids.",

      "abstract": "Carotenoids, known for their antioxidant properties, have garnered significant attention for their potential antitumour activities. This comprehensive review aims to elucidate the diverse mechanisms by which carotenoids exert antitumour effects, focusing on both well-established and novel findings. We explore their role in inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell cycle progression and preventing metastasis by affecting oncogenic and tumour suppressor proteins. The review also explores the pro-oxidant function of carotenoids within cancer cells. In fact, although their overall contribution to cellular antioxidant defences is well known and significant, some carotenoids can exhibit pro-oxidant effects under certain conditions and are able to elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in tumoural cells, triggering mitochondrial pathways that would lead to cell death. The final balance between their antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities depends on several factors, including the specific carotenoid, its concentration and the redox environment of the cell. Clinical trials are discussed, highlighting the conflicting results of carotenoids in cancer treatment and the importance of personalized approaches. Emerging research on rare carotenoids like bacterioruberin showcases their superior antioxidant capacity and selective cytotoxicity against aggressive cancer subtypes, such as triple-negative breast cancer. Future directions include innovative delivery systems, novel combinations and personalized treatments, aiming to enhance the therapeutic potential of carotenoids. This review highlights the promising yet complex landscape of carotenoid-based cancer therapies, calling for continued research and clinical exploration."

RECENT FINDINGS: Lutein and zeaxanthin are phytochemical compounds in the carotenoid group and are synthesised only by plants. All mammals get lutein and zeaxanthin into their bodies by consuming plant-based foods. Especially leafy green vegetables, broccoli, pumpkin, cabbage, spinach and egg yolk are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin. Lutein and zeaxanthin have potential health effects by preventing free radical formation, exhibiting protective properties against oxidative damage and reducing oxidative stress. These compounds have neuroprotective, cardioprotective, ophthalmological, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-osteoporosis, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and antimicrobial effects. The preventive properties of lutein and zeaxanthin against numerous diseases have attracted attention recently. Further clinical trials with large samples are needed to make generalisations in the prevention and treatment of diseases and to determine the appropriate doses and forms of lutein and zeaxanthin.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and it has affected the living quality of elderly people significantly. PD is characterised by the accumulation of α-Synuclein and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons at the substantia nigra pars compacta. In the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, α-Synuclein, oxidative stress, and electron transport chain (ETC) are the three main factors that contribute to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Currently, there is no commercial disease-modifying agent available for PD; the first-line treatment, Levodopa (l-DOPA), could only relieve the symptoms of PD, with many side effects. Carotenoids, which encompass red, orange, and yellow pigments found in nature and contribute to the colouration of plants, have been associated with various health benefits, including anti-cancer and neuroprotective effects due to their antioxidant properties.

In this research, carotenoid extracts obtained from the pulp of eight pumpkin varieties, belonging to the C. moschata and C. maxima species, were tested for cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The results showed that pumpkin bioactives exert a cytotoxic action against the tested cells, in particular Butternut extract at a 100 μM (53.69 μg/mL) concentration after 24 h of treatment and Mantovana extract at 50 μM (26.84 μg/mL) after 48 h. Moreover, the carotenoid extracts also showed interesting in vitro antioxidant activity, evaluated by ABTS and ORAC assays. To fully characterize the qualitative and quantitative profile of carotenoids in the tested extracts, a high-performance chromatographic technique was performed, revealing that pumpkin pulp carotenoids were mainly represented by β-carotene, mono- and di-esterified hydroxy- and epoxy-carotenoids. Moreover, the carotenoid dataset was also useful for discriminating samples from two different species.

      "abstract": "This in vivo study performed in rat adjuvant arthritis aims to advance the understanding of astaxanthin's therapeutic properties for the possible treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in monotherapy and along with the standard RA treatment, methotrexate (MTX), in combination therapy. The main goal was to elucidate astaxanthin's full therapeutic potential, evaluate its dose dependency, and compare its effects in monotherapy with other carotenoids such as β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin (KXAN). Moreover, potential differences in therapeutic activity caused by using different sources of astaxanthin, synthetic (ASYN) versus isolated from Blakeslea trispora (ASTAP), were evaluated using one-way ANOVA (Tukey-Kramer post hoc test). KXAN was the most effective in reducing plasma MMP-9 levels in monotherapy, significantly better than MTX, and in reducing hind paw swelling. The differences in the action of ASTAP and ASYN have been observed across various biometric, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative parameters. In combined therapy with MTX, the ASYN + MTX combination proved to be better. These findings, especially the significant anti-arthritic effect of KXAN and ASYN + MTX, could be the basis for further preclinical studies.",

      "abstract": "Eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), impose a substantial health cost on a worldwide scale. Carotenoids have emerged as intriguing candidates for pharmacological treatment of various disorders. Their therapeutic effectiveness, however, is hindered by poor solubility and vulnerability to degradation. Nanocarriers, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles, provide a transformational way to overcome these limits. This review explores the pharmacological potential of carotenoids, namely lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin, to treat several ocular disorders. The main emphasis is on their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, which help to counteract inflammation and oxidative stress, crucial factors in the development of AMD and DR. The review evaluates the significant benefits of nano-formulated carotenoids, such as improved bioavailability, higher cellular absorption, precise administration to particular ocular tissues, and greater biostability, which make them superior to conventional carotenoids. Some clinical studies on the beneficial properties of carotenoids in eye diseases are discussed. Furthermore, safety and regulatory concerns are also taken into account. Ultimately, carotenoids, especially when created in their nano form, have significant potential for safeguarding eyesight and enhancing the overall well-being of several individuals afflicted with vision-endangering eye diseases.",

      "abstract": "The peach palm fruit (Bactris gasipaes) peel is a byproduct after fruit consumption. The peel flour of two varieties (yellow and red) was separately obtained by hot air drying and was subsequently milled. The proximate analysis showed that the red variety exhibited higher protein, fat, and fiber contents than the yellow one. A higher carotenoid (836.5 ± 24.5 μg/g), phenolic compounds (83.17 ± 1.76 mg GAE/100 g), and provitamin A activity (33.10 ± 0.83 μg retinol/g) were found in the cooked red variety. The carotenoid and phenolic compositions were analyzed by HPLC-PDA-MS, finding β-carotene and γ-carotene to be major compounds. The effect of thermal treatment increased the amount of these provitamin A carotenoids and lycopene, which were detected only in the red variety. Among phenolic compounds, procyanidin dimer (isomer I), feruloyl quinic acid, and several apigenin C-hexosides were identified as major constituents of peach palm epicarp. A carotenoid-rich emulsion-based delivery system was obtained after the optimization (RSM model) of carotenoid extraction with ultraturrax and sunflower oil and further development of an ultrasound-assisted emulsion. The best conditions for a stable emulsion were 73.75% water, 25% carotenoid-rich oil extract, 1.25% emulsifiers, and 480 W of ultrasonic power for 5 min. The optimized emulsion had a total carotenoid content of 67.61 μg/g, Provitamin A activity of 3.23 ± 0.56 μg RAE/g, droplet size of 502.23 nm, polydispersity index of 0.170, and zeta potential of -32.26 mV. This emulsion was chemically and physically stable for 35 days at 30 ± 2 °C, showing potential as a food additive with biofunctional properties. The strategy here developed is an economical and environmentally friendly process that allows the reuse of the byproduct of B. gasipaes."

      "abstract": "Carotenoids constitute compounds of significant biological interest due to their multiple biological activities, such as antimicrobial, anticancer, antiadipogenic, antidiabetic, and antioxidant properties. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprehends a series of metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypertension, obesity, and atherogenic dyslipidemia) that can affect children, adolescents, and the elderly. The treatment of MetS involves numerous medications, which, despite their efficacy, pose challenges due to prolonged use, high costs, and various side effects. Carotenoids and their derivatives have been proposed as alternative treatments to MetS because they reduce serum triglyceride concentrations, promote insulin response, inhibit adipogenesis, and downregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. However, carotenoids are notably sensitive to pH, light exposure, and temperature. This review addresses the activity of carotenoids such as lycopene, lutein, fucoxanthin, astaxanthin, crocin, and β-carotene towards MetS. It includes a discussion of sources, extraction methods, and characterization techniques for analyzing carotenoids. Encapsulation approaches are critically reviewed as alternatives to prevent degradation and improve the biological performance of carotenoids. A brief overview of the physiopathology and epidemiology of the diseases, including MetS, is also provided."

      "abstract": "Carotenoid oxidative cleavage is a significant factor contributing to the color changes of shredded carrots and treatment with calcium chloride (CaCl2, 1% w/v) has been observed to alleviate the whitening symptom and color loss. However, the specific mechanism by which CaCl2 treatment suppresses carotenoid degradation remains unclear. In this study, the effect of CaCl2 and EGTA (calcium ion chelating agent) treatment on carotenoid biosynthesis and degradation in shredded carrots and the mechanism involved was investigated. CaCl2 treatment promoted the expression and activity of carotenoid biosynthetic enzyme (phytoene synthase, PSY), but inhibited the increases of the degradative enzyme activity of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) and down-regulated the corresponding transcripts, thus delayed the degradation of total carotenoid and maintaining higher levels of major carotenoid compounds including β-carotene, α-carotene, lycopene, and lutein in shredded carrots during storage. However, EGTA treatment promoted the gene expression and enzyme activity of CCD and increased the degradation of carotenoid compounds in shredded carrots during storage. Furthermore, the CaCl2 treatment induced DcCAMTA4, identified as a calcium decoder in shredded carrots, which, in turn, suppressed the expressions of DcCCD1 and DcCCD4 by interacting with their promoters. The transient overexpression of DcCAMTA4 in tobacco leaves led to reduced expression of NtCCD1 and NtCCD4, maintaining a higher content of carotenoids. Thus, CaCl2 alleviated the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids in shredded carrots through the DcCAMTA4-mediated carotenoid degradation pathway.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress, an imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant status, favouring the pro-oxidant state is a result of increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or inadequate antioxidant protection. ROS are produced through several mechanisms in cells including during mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Increased mitochondrial-derived ROS are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, an early event in age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's diseases (ADs) and in metabolic disorders including diabetes. AD post-mortem investigations of affected brain regions have shown the accumulation of oxidative damage to macromolecules, and oxidative stress has been considered an important contributor to disease pathology. An increase in oxidative stress, which leads to increased levels of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and other ROS in a potentially vicious cycle is both causative and a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be ameliorated by molecules with antioxidant capacities that accumulate in mitochondria such as carotenoids. However, the role of carotenoids in mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction is not fully understood. A better understanding of the role of antioxidants in mitochondrial function is a promising lead towards the development of novel and effective treatment strategies for age-related diseases. This review evaluates and summarises some of the latest developments and insights into the effects of carotenoids on mitochondrial dysfunction with a focus on the antioxidant properties of carotenoids. The mitochondria-protective role of carotenoids may be key in therapeutic strategies and targeting the mitochondria ROS is emerging in drug development for age-related diseases.",

One effective strategy for mitigating occurrence of melasma is consumption of nutricosmetics with depigmentation properties. The present review aimed to investigate the potential of red fruit as a depigmentation agent. Carotenoids serve a crucial role in human nutrition as a precursor to vitamin A. Carotenoids serve as scavengers of reactive oxygen species generated by ultraviolet radiation. Carotenoids promote skin health. Red fruit, a fruit originating from Papua (Indonesia) has anti-pigmentation properties associated with its ability to block melanogenesis through various protein pathways such as PKA, ERK, and AKT signaling pathways. The consumption of food rich in carotenoids, such as red fruit, has advantageous properties to reduce hyperpigmentation and skin brightening."

      "abstract": "Salmorejo, a Mediterranean tomato-oil puree, is considered a dietary source of antioxidant vitamins C and E and carotenoids lycopene and β-carotene, the latter endowed with provitamin A activity. However, these antioxidants can be degraded in oxidation reactions catalysed or not by enzymes during pasteurisation and storage treatments used to stabilise the salmorejo before consumption. Due to its better penetration, the use of dielectric heating by radiofrequency (RF) may improve results of pasteurisation in this product. The objective was to assess the effects of pasteurisation temperature (70-100 °C, at 5 °C intervals) and storage time (0-5 months, at one-month intervals) on levels of ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol and carotenoids and antioxidant capacity (AC) in salmorejo pasteurised (over 10 s) by conventional (CH) or RF continuous heating. Two successive experiments were conducted to select an adequate pasteurisation temperature for use in the shelf-life study. Pasteurisation upon tested conditions allows a good retention of salmorejo antioxidants. Either CH or RF pasteurisers can be used with similar results. Vitamin C (L-ascorbic + dehydroascorbic acids) was more abundant (15-19 mg 100 g-1) than carotenoids (0.9-2.6 mg 100 g-1) (all-trans + cis lycopene and β-carotene) and α-tocopherol (0.8-1.2 mg 100 g-1) in the pasteurised product. Using excessively low temperatures (70 °C) resulted in partial losses of the three antioxidants, possibly due to oxidase residual activities. Intensifying thermal treatment improved this issue with minor losses of the thermolabile vitamin C and increased carotenoid content. Using a suitable temperature (80 °C) did not prevent most vitamin C from being degraded by the first month, while α-tocopherol, and, to a lesser extent, carotenoids, showed good retention levels during shelf life under refrigeration. Vitamins C and E and carotenoids, either by degradation, regeneration or releasing, likely contribute to the AC in salmorejo. Phenolic antioxidant response, radical-scavenging activities and redox potential values confirmed this finding. The pasteurised-chilled salmorejo shows good antioxidant properties with potential health implications, a positive nutritional aspect for consumers of this tomato-oil homogenate. The losses of antioxidants and AC due to pasteurization would be of little relevance compared to the losses accumulated during shelf life."

The aim of this controlled feeding trial was to explore SCS's response to carotenoid intake changes via whole-diet intervention, evaluating its biomarker potential. METHODS: Eighty participants ages 20 to 49 y, without underlying diseases, were randomly allocated to the high-carotenoid group (HG; n = 40) or control group (CG; n = 40). The HG consumed a high-carotenoid diet (21 mg total carotenoids/2000 kcal), whereas the CG consumed a control diet (13.6 mg total carotenoids/2000 kcal) for 6 wk. Subsequently, skin and blood carotenoid concentrations were tracked without intervention for 4 wk. SCS was measured weekly via resonance Raman spectroscopy, and serum carotenoid concentrations were analyzed biweekly using high-performance liquid chromatography. Baseline carotenoid and F&V intakes were assessed via a 3-d diet record. The kinetics of SCS and serum carotenoid concentrations were analyzed using a weighted generalized estimating equation. Pearson's correlation analyses were used to examine baseline correlations between SCS and dietary carotenoid and F&V intakes, as well as serum carotenoid concentrations. RESULTS: During the intervention, the HG showed a faster and greater SCS increase than the CG (difference in slope per week = 8.87 AU, Pinteraction <0.001). Baseline SCS had positive correlations with total carotenoid intake (r = 0.45), total F&V intake (r = 0.49), and total serum carotenoid concentration (r = 0.79; P < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SCS is a valid biomarker for monitoring changes in carotenoid intake through whole diet, which supports using SCS for assessing carotenoid-rich F&V intake.",

Worm-like thin prefibrilar intermediates were formed in low salt concentrations (0-75 mM), which twisted to be the thick and mature amyloid-like fibrils with multistrands as the salt content was elevated (150-300 mM). Absorption of the fibrils fabricated in high salt concentrations to the oil/water interface constructed the protein layer with a significantly higher interfacial modulus compared with the one formed by the fibrils fabricated in low salt concentrations. Consequently, they showed the superiority in stabilizing high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) with oil volume fraction ratios higher than 74%. HIPEs stabilized by the high salt-concentration-induced legume protein fibrils had stronger capabilities not only in encapsulating liposoluble carotenoids but also in protecting their stability against heating, ultraviolet, and iron ion stimulus, compared with the one stabilized by the low-salt-concentration-induced legume protein fibrils. Bioaccessibilities of the carotenoids in simulating gastrointestinal (GI) digestion were significantly improved after encapsulation by the HIPEs, which were interestingly increased with the elevation of salt concentrations utilized for preparing the legume protein fibrils. Furthermore, the carotenoids-loading-HIPEs were injectable and showed in vivo nutritional functions of mitigating colitis.",

We focused on abetalipoproteinemia (FHBL-SD1) and chylomicron retention disease (FHBL-SD3), caused by mutations in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) and SAR1B genes, respectively. Treatments include a low-fat diet and high-dose fat-soluble vitamin supplementations. However, patients are not supplemented in carotenoids, a group of lipid-soluble pigments essential for eye health. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate carotenoid absorption and status in the context of hypobetalipoproteinemia. METHODS: We first used knock-out Caco-2/TC7 cell models of FHBL-SD1 and FHBL-SD3 to evaluate carotenoid absorption. We then characterized FHBL-SD1 and FHBL-SD3 patient status in the main dietary carotenoids and compared it to that of control subjects. RESULTS: In vitro results showed a significant decrease in basolateral secretion of α- and β-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin (-88.8 ± 2.2 % to -95.3 ± 5.8 %, -79.2 ± 4.4 % to -96.1 ± 2.6 %, -91.0 ± 4.5 % to -96.7 ± 0.3 % and -65.4 ± 3.6 % to -96.6 ± 1.9 %, respectively). Carotenoids plasma levels in patients confirmed significant deficiencies, with decreases ranging from -89 % for zeaxanthin to -98 % for α-carotene, compared to control subjects. CONCLUSION: Given the continuous loss in visual function despite fat-soluble vitamin treatment in some patients, carotenoid supplementation may be of clinical utility. Future studies should assess the correlation between carotenoid status and visual function in aging patients and investigate whether carotenoid supplementation could prevent their visual impairment.",

Astaxanthin, the major component of MC, belongs to the xanthophyll class of carotenoids, and is well known for its antioxidant properties. In this work, in vitro and in vivo studies on the biological activity of MC were carried out. The complex was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and cancer-preventive activity, without any toxicity at a dose of 500 mg/kg. MC effectively improves the clinical picture of the disease progressing, as well as normalizing the cytokine profile and the antioxidant defense system in the in vivo animal models of inflammatory diseases, namely: skin carcinogenesis, allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and systemic inflammation (SI). In the skin carcinogenesis induced by 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene, the incidence of papillomas was decreased 1.5 times; 1% MC ointment form in allergic contact dermatitis showed an 80% reduced severity of pathomorphological skin manifestations. Obtained results show that MC from starfish P. pectinifera is an effective remedy for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory processes.",

The ideal dose of norflurazon (1 µg/mL) was selected to block the carotenoid pathway at the level of phytoene desaturase and induce the accumulation of phytoene in C. sorokiniana. A mill pre-treatment allowed a higher recovery of carotenoids compared to non-milled samples, in both the freeze-dried and encapsulated matrices. 2-Methyloxolane provided a higher total carotenoid content (4.75-5546.96 µg/g) compared to the other solvents tested in all the matrices, proving a promising bio-based solvent to replace traditional organic ones for the extraction of microalgal carotenoids.",

      "abstract": "Humans are unique indiscriminate carotenoid accumulators, so the human body accumulates a wide range of dietary carotenoids of different types and to varying concentrations. Carotenoids were once recognized as physiological antioxidants because of their ability to quench singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). In the 1990s, large-scale intervention studies failed to demonstrate that supplementary β-carotene intake reduces the incidence of lung cancer, although its antioxidant activity was supposed to contribute to the prevention of oxidative stress-induced carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, the antioxidant activity of carotenoids has attracted renewed attention as the pathophysiological role of 1O2 has emerged, and as the ability of dietary carotenoids to induce antioxidant enzymes has been revealed. This review focuses on six major carotenoids from fruit and vegetables and revisits their physiological functions as biological antioxidants from the standpoint of health promotion and disease prevention. β-Carotene 9',10'-oxygenase-derived oxidative metabolites trigger increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Lutein and zeaxanthin selectively accumulate in human macular cells to protect against light-induced macular impairment by acting as antioxidants. Lycopene accumulates exclusively and to high concentrations in the testis, where its antioxidant activity may help to eliminate oxidative damage. Dietary carotenoids appear to exert their antioxidant activity in photo-irradiated skin after their persistent deposition in the skin. An acceptable level of dietary carotenoids for disease prevention should be established because they can have deleterious effects as prooxidants if they accumulate to excess levels. Finally, it is expected that the reason why humans are indiscriminate carotenoid accumulators will be understood soon.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a debilitating condition that affects the mind and the individual's body. The improving effects of saffron on depression and anxiety have long been discussed, with limited information about the molecular mechanism of action. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: Investigating the effect of saffron carotenoids, Crocin and Crocetin, on depression and anxiety in rats by emphasizing some signaling pathways involved. STUDY DESIGN: Depression and anxiety were induced in rats via unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Then different rat groups were treated with Crocin, Crocetin, Fluoxetine, and vehicle. Behavioral tests were done before and after treatment. METHODS: The serum Serotonin and Corticosterone and the expression of some hippocampal signaling proteins were studied. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools were used to predict the interactions of Crocin/ Crocetin with the Serotonin transporter and NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Then, the patch-clamp was used to study the interaction of Crocetin with the NMDA receptor. RESULTS: Various behavioral tests confirmed the induction of depression and the improvement of depression by these natural carotenoids. In addition, Crocin/ Crocetin significantly increased the decreased serum Serotonin and reduced the increased serum Corticosterone in the depressed groups. They also increased or caused a trend of increase in the CREB, ERK, BAD, BDNF, p11, and 5-HT1B expression in the hippocampus of the depressed groups. In addition, there were an increase or a trend in p-CREB/CREB, p-ERK1/2 /ERK1/2, and p-BAD/BAD ratios in the Crocin/ Crocetin treated depressed groups. However, the NR2B and FOXO3a expression showed a trend of decrease in depressed groups after treatment. The bioinformatics data indicated that Crocin/ Crocetin could bind to the Serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. Both carotenoids bind to the same site as Fluoxetine in the SLC6A4. However, they bound to different sites on the NR2B. So, Crocetin binds to NR2B at the same site as Ifenprodil. But Crocin bound to another site. The whole cell patch-clamp recording on the normal rat hippocampus revealed a significant decrease in the NMDA peak amplitude after Crocetin treatment, indicating its inhibitory effect on this receptor. CONCLUSION: The antidepressant activities of Crocin/ Crocetin are possibly due to their effects on Serotonin and Corticosterone serum concentrations, NR2B expression, and the downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, these natural carotenoids, like Fluoxetine, induced an increasing tendency in p11 and 5HT1B in depressed rats.",

The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of carotenoids on gut microbiota, gut barrier, and inflammation in healthy animals. The systematic search from PubMed, Scopus, and Lilacs databases were performed up to March 2023. The final screening included thirty studies, with different animal models (mice, rats, pigs, chicks, drosophila, fish, and shrimp), and different carotenoid sources (β-carotene, lycopene, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, and fucoxanthin). The results suggested that carotenoids seem to act on gut microbiota by promoting beneficial effects on intestinal bacteria related to both inflammation and SCFA production; increase tight junction proteins expression, important for reducing intestinal permeability; increase the mucins expression, important in protecting against pathogens and toxins; improve morphological parameters important for digestion and absorption of nutrients; and reduce pro-inflammatory and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, different carotenoids had distinct effects on gut health. In addition, there was heterogeneity between studies regarding animal model, duration of intervention, and doses used. This is the first systematic review to address the effects of carotenoids on gut health. Further studies are needed to better understand the effects of carotenoids on gut health.",

      "abstract": "In women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.7% of total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (6.9%) worldwide. Bioactive dietary components such as Sea buckthorn berries are known for their high carotenoid content, which has been shown to possess anti-cancer properties. Considering the limited number of studies investigating the bioactive properties of carotenoids in breast cancer, the aim of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative, antioxidant, and proapoptotic properties of saponified lipophilic Sea buckthorn berries extract (LSBE) in two breast cancer cell lines with different phenotypes: T47D (ER+, PR+, HER2-) and BT-549 (ER-, PR-, HER2-). The antiproliferative effects of LSBE were evaluated by an Alamar Blue assay, the extracellular antioxidant capacity was evaluated through DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays, the intracellular antioxidant capacity was evaluated through a DCFDA assay, and the apoptosis rate was assessed by flow cytometry. LSBE inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a mean IC50 of 16 µM. LSBE has proven to be a good antioxidant both at the intracellular level, due to its ability to significantly decrease the ROS levels in both cell lines (p = 0.0279 for T47D, and p = 0.0188 for BT-549), and at the extracellular level, where the ABTS and DPPH inhibition vried between 3.38-56.8%, respectively 5.68-68.65%, and 35.6 mg/L equivalent ascorbic acid/g LSBE were recorded. Based on the results from the antioxidant assays, LSBE was found to have good antioxidant activity due to its rich carotenoid content. The flow cytometry results revealed that LSBE treatment induced significant alterations in late-stage apoptotic cells represented by 80.29% of T47D cells (p = 0.0119), and 40.6% of BT-549 cells (p = 0.0137). Considering the antiproliferative, antioxidant, and proapoptotic properties of the carotenoids from LSBE on breast cancer cells, further studies should investigate whether these bioactive dietary compounds could be used as nutraceuticals in breast cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Upon understanding the boosting role of carotenoids on the endogenous anti-inflammatory system, it is vital to explore their role in reducing the use of high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), and their mediated secondary toxicity during the treatment of chronic diseases. The current study investigates the carotenoids potential on inhibition of secondary complications induced by NSAIDs, aspirin (ASA) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated inflammation. Initially, this study evaluated a minimal cytotoxic dose of ASA and carotenoids (β-carotene, BC/lutein, LUT/astaxanthin, AST/fucoxanthin FUCO) in Raw 264.7, U937, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In all three cells, carotenoids + ASA treatment reduced the LDH release, NO, and PGE2 efficiently than an equivalent dose of carotenoid or ASA treated alone. Based on cytotoxicity and sensitivity results, RAW 264.7 cells were selected for further cell-based assay. Among carotenoids, FUCO + ASA exhibited an efficient reduction of LDH release, NO, and PGE2 than the other carotenoids (BC + ASA, LUT + ASA, and AST + ASA) treatment. FUCO + ASA combination decreased LPS/ASA induced oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory mediators (iNOS, COX-2, and NF-κB), and cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) efficiently. Further, apoptosis was inhibited by 69.2% in FUCO + ASA, and 46.7% in ASA than LPS treated cells. A drastic decrease in intracellular ROS generation with the increase in GSH was observed in FUCO + ASA compared to LPS/ASA groups. The results documented on the low dose of ASA with a relative physiological concentration of FUCO suggested greater importance for alleviating secondary complications and optimize prolonged chronic disease treatments with NSAID's associated side effects.

Unfortunately, the definitive diagnosis of MS is prolonged and involves mainly clinical symptoms observation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the CNS. However, as we previously reported, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy shed new light on the minimally invasive, label-free, and rapid diagnosis of this illness through blood fraction. Herein we introduce Raman spectroscopy coupled with chemometric analysis to provide more detailed information about the biochemical changes behind MS. This pilot study demonstrates that mentioned combination may provide a new diagnostic biomarker and bring closer to rapid MS diagnosis. It has been shown that Raman spectroscopy provides lipid and carotenoid molecules as useful biomarkers which may be applied for both diagnosis and treatment monitoring.",

Antioxidants might help prevent it by modulating biochemical processes involved in cell proliferation. Here, the aim was to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic effect of Haloferax mediterranei bacterioruberin-rich carotenoid extracts (BRCE) (0-100 µg/ml) in six BC cell lines, representative of the intrinsic phenotypes and a healthy mammary epithelium cell line. Cell index values were obtained using xCELLigence RTCA System. Furthermore, cell diameter, viability, and concentration were measured at 12 h, 24 h, and 30 h. We found that BC cells were selectively affected by BRCE (SI > 1, p < 0.005). After 30 h, the population of BC cells exposed to 100 µg/ml was 11.7-64.6% of the control (p = 0.0001-0.0009). Triple-negative cells were significantly affected [MDA-MB-231 (IC50 51.8 µg/ml, p < 0.0001) and MDA-MB-468 (IC50 63.9 µg/ml, p < 0.0001)]. Cell size was also reduced after 30 h treatment in 3.8 (± 0.1) µm and 3.3 (± 0.02) µm for SK-BR-3 (p < 0.0001) and MDA-MB-468 (p < 0.0001), respectively. In conclusion, Hfx. mediterranei BRCE exerts a cytotoxic effect on BC cell lines representative of all studied intrinsic subtypes. Furthermore, results obtained for MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 are very promising, considering the aggressive behaviour of the triple-negative BC subtype.",

Carotenoids, including astaxanthin, lycopene, lutein, fucoxanthin, crocin and others are natural pigments and antioxidants, and can be used to treat a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. However, carotenoids, as oil-soluble substances with additional unsaturated groups, suffer from low solubility, poor stability and poor bioavailability. Therefore, the preparation of various nano-drug delivery systems from carotenoids is a current measure to achieve efficient application of carotenoids. Different carotenoid delivery systems can improve the solubility, stability, permeability and bioavailability of carotenoids to a certain extent to achieve Alzheimer's disease efficacy. This review summarizes recent data on different carotenoid nano-drug delivery systems for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including polymer, lipid, inorganic and hybrid nano-drug delivery systems.

      "abstract": "The assessment of dietary carotenoids via blood measurements has been widely used as a marker for fruit and vegetable consumption. In the present study, modern, non-invasive approaches to assess dietary carotenoids, such as skin measurements and an app-based short dietary record (ASDR), were compared with conventional methods such as plasma status and handwritten 3-day dietary records. In an 8-week observational study, 21 healthy participants aged 50-65 years recorded their daily consumption of carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables via a specially developed ASDR. Anthropometry, blood samplings and assessment of skin carotenoids via Raman and reflection spectroscopy were performed at baseline, after four weeks and at the end of the study. App-based intake data showed good correlations with plasma α-carotene (r = 0.74, p < 0.0001), β-carotene (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001), and total plasma carotenoids (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001); weak correlations with plasma lutein/zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin (both r = 0.34, p < 0.05); and no correlation with plasma lycopene. Skin measurements via reflection and Raman spectroscopy correlated well with total plasma carotenoids (r = 0.81 and 0.72, respectively; both p < 0.0001), α-carotene (r = 0.75-0.62, p < 0.0001), and β-carotene (r = 0.79-0.71, p < 0.0001); moderately with plasma lutein/zeaxanthin (both r = 0.51, p < 0.0001); weakly with plasma β-cryptoxanthin (r = 0.40-0.31, p < 0.05); and showed no correlation with plasma lycopene. Skin measurements could provide a more convenient and noninvasive approach of estimating a person's fruit and vegetable consumption compared to traditional methods, especially in studies that do not intend blood sampling. ASDR records might function as a suitable, convenient tool for dietary assessment in nutritional intervention studies.",

      "abstract": "Phycobiliproteins, carotenoids and fucoxanthin are photosynthetic pigments extracted from microalgae and cyanobacteria with great potential biotechnological applications, as healthy food colorants and cosmetics. Phycocyanin possesses a brilliant blue color, with fluorescent properties making it useful as a reagent for immunological essays. The most important source of phycocyanin is the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis, however, recently, the Rhodophyta Galdieria sulphuraria has also been identified as such. The main obstacle to the commercialization of phycocyanin is represented by its chemical instability, strongly reducing its shelf-life. Moreover, the high level of purity needed for pharmaceutical applications requires several steps which increase both the production time and cost. Microalgae (Chlorella, Dunaliella, Nannochloropsis, Scenedesmus) produce several light harvesting carotenoids, and are able to manage with oxidative stress, due to their free radical scavenging properties, which makes them suitable for use as source of natural antioxidants. Many studies focused on the selection of the most promising strains producing valuable carotenoids and on their extraction and purification. Among carotenoids produced by marine microalgae, fucoxanthin is the most abundant, representing more than 10% of total carotenoids. Despite the abundance and diversity of fucoxanthin producing microalgae only a few species have been studied for commercial production, the most relevant being Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Due to its antioxidant activity, fucoxanthin can bring various potential benefits to the prevention and treatment of lifestyle-related diseases. In this review, we update the main results achieved in the production, extraction, purification, and commercialization of these important pigments, motivating the cultivation of microalgae as a source of natural pigments.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder caused either by inadequate insulin secretion, impaired insulin function, or both. Uncontrolled diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia which over time leads to fatal damage to both macro-and microvascular systems, causing complications such as cardiovascular diseases, retinopathy and nephropathy. Diabetes management is conventionally delivered through modifications of diet and lifestyle and pharmacological treatment, using antidiabetic drugs, and ultimately insulin injections. However, the side effects and financial cost of medications often reduce patient compliance to treatment, negatively affecting their health outcomes. Natural phytochemicals from edible plants such as fruits and vegetables (F&V) and medicinal herbs have drawn a growing interest as potential therapeutic agents for treating diabetes and preventing the onset and progression of diabetic complications. Flavonoids, the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet, have shown antidiabetic effects in numerous in vitro and preclinical studies. The underlying mechanisms have been linked to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Carotenoids, another major group of dietary phytochemicals, have also shown antidiabetic potential in recent in vitro and in vivo experimental models, possibly through a mechanism of action similar to that of flavonoids. However, scientific evidence on the efficacy of these phytochemicals in treating diabetes or preventing the onset and progression of its complications in clinical settings is scarce, which delays the translation of animal study evidence to human applications and also limits the knowledge on their modes of actions in diabetes management. This review is aimed to highlight the potential roles of flavonoids and carotenoids in preventing or ameliorating diabetes-related complications based on in vivo study evidence, i.e., an array of preclinical animal studies and human intervention trials. The current general consensus of the underlying mechanisms of action exerted by both groups of phytochemicals is that their anti-inflammatory action is key. However, other potential mechanisms of action are considered. In total, 50 in vivo studies were selected for a review after a comprehensive database search via PubMed and ScienceDirect from January 2002 to August 2022. The key words used for analysis are type-2 diabetes (T2DM), diabetic complications, flavonoids, carotenoids, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, mechanisms of prevention and amelioration, animal studies and human interventions."

      "abstract": "Diet is a critical factor in controlling adiposity and white adipose tissue (WAT) physiology. A high-fat diet (HFD) alters WAT function and affects AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) - a cellular sensor - dysregulating lipolysis and lipid metabolism in adipocytes. Otherwise, AMPK activation may attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation. Interest in natural therapies, such as carotenoid consumption or supplementation, is growing due to their health benefits. Carotenoids are lipophilic pigments present in vegetables and fruits, which cannot be synthesized by the human body. Interventions focused on ameliorating complications induced by a HFD indicate a positive contribution of the carotenoids to the AMPK activation. This review aims to outline the mechanism of carotenoids in the AMPK pathway in adipose tissue and their contribution in regulating adipogenesis. Different carotenoids can act as an agonist of the AMPK signaling pathway, activating upstream kinases, upregulating transcriptional factors, inducing WAT browning, and blocking adipogenesis. In addition, the improvement of some \"homeostatic\" factors, such as adiponectin, may mediate the AMPK activation induced by carotenoids. With these findings, we encourage clinical trials to confirm the role of carotenoids in the AMPK pathway in a long-term treatment, mainly in obesity cases.",

      "abstract": "Numerous factors can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Oxidative stress (OS), a fairly common ND symptom, can be caused by more reactive oxygen species being made. In addition, the pathological state of NDs, which includes a high number of protein aggregates, could make chronic inflammation worse by activating microglia. Carotenoids, often known as \"CTs\", are pigments that exist naturally and play a vital role in the prevention of several brain illnesses. CTs are organic pigments with major significance in ND prevention. More than 600 CTs have been discovered in nature, and they may be found in a wide variety of creatures. Different forms of CTs are responsible for the red, yellow, and orange pigments seen in many animals and plants. Because of their unique structure, CTs exhibit a wide range of bioactive effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The preventive effects of CTs have led researchers to find a strong correlation between CT levels in the body and the avoidance and treatment of several ailments, including NDs. To further understand the connection between OS, neuroinflammation, and NDs, a literature review has been compiled. In addition, we have focused on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of CTs for the treatment and management of NDs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The sensitivity of commercially available devices to detect changes in skin carotenoids is not known. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the sensitivity of pressure-mediated reflection spectroscopy (RS) to detect changes in skin carotenoids in response to increasing carotenoid intake. METHODS: Nonobese adults were randomly assigned to a control (water; n = 20; females = 15 (75%); mean age: 31 ± 3 (SE) y; mean BMI: 26 ± 1 kg/m2) or one of 3 carotenoid intake levels: 1) LOW - 13.1 mg; n = 22; females = 18(82%); age: 33 ± 3 y; BMI: 25 ± 1 kg/m2; 2) MED - 23.9 mg; n = 22; females = 17 (77%); age: 30 ± 2 y; BMI: 26 ± 1 kg/m2); or 3) HIGH - 31.0 mg; n = 19; females = 9 (47%); age: 33 ± 3 y; BMI: 24 ± 1 kg/m2. A commercial vegetable juice was provided daily to ensure that the additional carotenoid intake was achieved. Skin carotenoids (RS intensity [RSI]) were measured weekly. Plasma carotenoid concentrations were assessed at wk 0, 4, and 8. Mixed models were used to test the effect of treatment, time, and their interaction. Correlation matrices from mixed models were used to determine the correlation between plasma and skin carotenoids. RESULTS: A correlation was observed between skin and plasma carotenoids (r = 0.65; P < 0.001). Skin carotenoids were greater than baseline starting at week 1 in the HIGH (290 ± 20 vs. 321 ± 24 RSI; P ≤ 0.01), week 2 in the MED (274 ± 18 vs. 290 ± 23 RSI; P ≤ 0.03), and week 3 in the LOW (261 ± 18 vs. 288 ± 15 RSI; P ≤ 0.03). Compared with control, differences in skin carotenoids were observed starting at week 2 in the HIGH ([268 ± 16 vs. 338 ± 26 RSI; P ≤ 0.01] except for week 3 [287 ± 20 vs. 335 ± 26 RSI; P = 0.08]) and week 6 in the MED (303 ± 26 vs. 363 ± 27 RSI; P ≤ 0.03). No differences were observed between the control and LOW. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that RS can detect changes in skin carotenoids in adults without obesity when daily carotenoid intake is increased by 13.1 mg for a minimum of 3 wk. However, a minimum difference in intake of 23.9 mg of carotenoids is needed to detect group differences. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03202043.",

During the first phase of the study, measurements of carotenoid concentrations were performed without revealing the antioxidant status, followed by an intervention phase during which the volunteers were informed about their individual values by biofeedback. During the third phase, biofeedback was combined with an additional intake of fruit juices. Across time points, participants showed increasing levels of carotenoid status.

In this study, the effect of carotenoids in carrot extracts on Candida species including Candida albicans ATCC1677, Candida glabrata CBS2175, Candida parapsilosis ATCC2195, and Candida tropicalis CBS94 was investigated. METHODS: In this descriptive study, the carrot plant was prepared from a carrot planting site in December 2012, and then the characteristics of the plant were determined. After extracting carotenoids from carrots, the susceptibility of different Candida species to carotenoids in carrot extract was determined. Also, the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum lethal concentration of the extracts were measured by the macro-dilution method. Finally, the data were analyzed by SPSS software using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney post-hoc test with Bonferroni adjustment. RESULTS: The highest growth inhibition zone was obtained for carrot extract at a concentration of 500 mg/ml for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis. The MFC of carrot extract on Candida species was 62.5 mg/ml for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis, and 125 mg/ml for C. tropicalis. The MFC of carrot extract on Candida species was 125 mg/ml for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis, and 250 mg/ml for C. tropicalis. CONCLUSION: The present study can be the starting point for research activities in this direction and promises new therapies based on the use of carotenoids.",

The thermal drying process is considered as an alternative method to reduce the bitterness. However, processing studies have rarely investigated physiochemical changes in fruit stages.

The color of the thermally treated fruit varied depending on the temperature. When heat-treated for 3 days, the samples from the 30 °C and 90 °C treatments turned brown, while the color of the 60 °C sample did not change significantly. The antioxidant activities were increased in the thermally processed samples in a temperature-dependent manner, with an increase in phenolic compounds. In the 90 °C samples, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity presented a 6.8-fold higher level than that of nonthermal treatment in mature yellow fruit (S3), whereas the activity showed about a 3.1-fold higher level in immature green (S1) and mature green (S2) fruits. Regardless of the stages, the carotenoid content tended to decrease with increasing temperature.

Production of carotenoids from microbial resources mainly from yeast has attracted commercial interest. Breast cancer has the highest incidence among women, and therapy resistance and lack of effective therapeutic strategies are major treatment bottlenecks, particularly for triple-negative subtypes. Yeast carotenoids are recently being evaluated for affordable, non-toxic, natural product-based therapies. In the present study, we have shown an environment-friendly and inexpensive method for carotenoid production from yeasts, utilizing \"mandi\" wastes, and investigated the biomedical properties of carotenoids, particularly antineoplastic properties. METHODS: Vegetable \"mandi\" waste was used to prepare waste hydrolysate, a culture medium, in which oleaginous red yeast Rhodosporidium sp. was grown. Carotenoid pigments were extracted using the solvent extraction method and analyzed by UV spectroscopy, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities of the extract were evaluated, followed by in silico docking and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion/toxicity (ADME/T) studies. RESULTS: Carotenoid extract was found to be composed of three main pigments-β-carotene, torulene, and torularhodin. Extract exhibited significant antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-breast cancer activities in vitro while being biocompatible. Interestingly, carotenoids have shown better efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells than ER+PR+ cells. In silico evaluation predicted binding with breast cancer-specific molecular targets, specifically the three components showed good binding energy toward VEGF receptors and good drug likeliness properties, as well as less toxicity. DISCUSSION: This is the first report on anti-breast cancer activities, particularly targeting TNBC cells by red yeast carotenoids (β-carotene, torulene, and torularhodin) produced via a sustainable environment-friendly bioprocess utilizing waste hydrolysate."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the association between skin advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) levels, blood antioxidative vitamin and carotenoid concentrations, and severe erectile dysfunction (ED) in community-dwelling men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the 5-Item International Index of Erectile Function to identify 335 community-dwelling men with ED. The accumulation of skin AGEs was assessed noninvasively by measuring skin autofluorescence. Background-adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses using the inverse probability of treatment weighting method were performed to evaluate the effects of AGEs, vitamins, and carotenoids on severe ED. Moreover, multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association between skin AGEs levels and serum carotenoid concentrations. RESULTS: The median age of study participants was 57 years. Of the 335 men, 289 (86.3%) and 46 (13.7%) were classified into the mild/moderate and severe ED groups, respectively. Multivariable analyses revealed that skin AGEs levels, blood vitamins C and E, lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene, β-carotene, total lycopene, and cis-lycopenes concentrations were significantly associated with severe ED, whereas all-trans lycopene concentrations were not. In the multiple linear regression analyses, serum zeaxanthin concentrations were negatively and significantly correlated with skin AGEs levels. CONCLUSIONS: Higher skin AGEs levels and lower blood antioxidative vitamin and carotenoid concentrations were significantly associated with severe ED. Serum zeaxanthin levels were negatively and significantly correlated with skin AGEs levels, suggesting the possible effects of zeaxanthin on ED by decreasing tissue AGEs levels."

      "abstract": "Microalgae are considered as ideal cell factories for producing natural carotenoids which display favorable biological activities. As the most important abiotic factor, light not only provides energy for photosynthetic metabolism, but also regulates numerous biological processes. Blue light is the main wavelength of light that can travel through water. Previous studies have shown that blue light triggered carotenoid accumulation in several microalgae species, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Cryptochromes were blue-light-absorbing photoreceptors that have been found in all studied algal genomes. In this study, several different types of cryptochrome genes were cloned from Haematococcus pluvialis and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Among them, cryptochrome genes HpCRY4 from H. pluvialis and PtCPF1 from P. tricornutum were upregulated under blue light treatment, in correlation with the increase of astaxanthin and fucoxanthin contents. Besides, heterologous expression and gene knockout was performed to verify the function of HpCRY4 and PtCPF1 in regulating carotenoid biosynthesis in microalgae. These results indicate that carotenoid biosynthesis in microalgae promoted by blue light was mediated by cryptochromes as photoreceptors."

      "abstract": "Skin exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in the sun causes premature ageing and may predispose to skin cancers. UV radiation generates excessive free radical species, resulting in oxidative stress, which is responsible for cellular and DNA damage. There is growing evidence that phytonutrients such as flavonoids and carotenoids may impede oxidative stress and prevent photodamage. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to explore the effects of certain phytonutrients in preventing skin photodamage. We searched the electronic Medline (Ovid) and Pubmed databases for relevant studies published between 2002 and 2022. The main inclusion criteria were articles written in English, and studies reporting the effects of phytonutrient-containing plants of interest on the skin or skin cells exposed to UV radiation. We focused on tea, blueberries, lemon, carrot, tomato, and grapes, which are rich in flavonoids and/or carotenoids. Out of 434 articles retrieved, 40 were identified as potentially relevant. Based on our inclusion criteria, nine articles were included in the review. The review comprises three combined in vitro and animal studies, four human studies, one in vitro research, and one mixed in vitro and human study. All the studies reported positive effects of flavonoids and carotenoid-containing plant extract on UV-induced skin damage. This evidence-based review highlights the potential use of flavonoids and carotenoids found in plants in preventing the deleterious effects of UV radiation on the skin. These compounds may have a role in clinical and aesthetic applications for the prevention and treatment of sunburn and photoaging, and may potentially be used against UV-related skin cancers.",

      "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a multifunctional pro-inflammatory cytokine, responsible for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. In COVID-19 patients, increased TNF-α concentration may provoke inflammatory cascade and induce the initiation of cytokine storm that may result in fatal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS). Hence, TNFα is assumed to be a promising drug target against cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. In the present study, we focused on finding novel small molecules that can directly block TNF-α-hTNFR1 (human TNF receptor 1) interaction. In this regards, TNF-α-inhibiting capacity of natural carotenoids was investigated in terms of blocking TNF-α-hTNFR1 interaction in COVID-19 patients with the help of a combination of in silico approaches, based on virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A total of 125 carotenoids were selected out of 1204 natural molecules, based on their pharmacokinetics properties and they all met Lipinski's rule of five. Among them, Sorgomol, Strigol and Orobanchol had the most favorable ΔG with the best ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) properties, and were selected for MD simulation studies, which explored the complex stability and the impact of ligands on protein conformation. Our results showed that Sorgomol formed the most hydrogen bonds, resulting in the highest binding energy with lowest RMSD and RMSF, which made it the most appropriate candidate as TNF-α inhibitor. In conclusion, the present study could serve to expand possibilities to develop new therapeutic small molecules against TNF-α.",

However, before consumption, the lupin seeds must be debittered in order to remove their bitter and toxic alkaloids. This study analyzed the impact on the bioactive compounds of Lupinus albus seeds of a recent time- and water-saving debittering method, which employs alternative washing solutions (0.5% or 1% of either NaCl or citric acid), with or without the assistance of ultrasound. The results were compared with those of two control methods using water or a NaCl solution. The sonication, when it was significant, led to a large loss of bioactive compounds, which was most likely due to its extraction capability. The seeds that were debittered without ultrasound presented high concentrations of tocopherols (172.8-241.3 mg/kg DM), carotenoids (10.9-25.1 mg/kg DM), and soluble-free (106.9-361.1 mg/kg DM), soluble-conjugated (93.9-118.9 mg/kg DM), and insoluble-bound (59.2-156.7 mg/kg DM) phenolics. The soluble-free fraction showed the greatest loss after a prolonged treatment. Overall, debittering with citric acid or NaCl preserved the highest concentration of antioxidant compounds by shortening the treatment time, thus preventing extensive leaching."

Microalgae-derived carotenoids are the type of accessory pigment that possess light-absorbing potential and play a significant role in metabolic functions. To date, nearly a thousand carotenoids have been reported, but a very less number of microalgae have been used for the commercial production of carotenoids. This review article briefly discussed the carotenoids of microalgal origin and their therapeutic application. In addition, we have briefly compiled the optimization of culture parameters used to enhance microalgal carotenoid production. In addition, the latest biotechnological approaches used to improve the yields of carotenoid has also been discussed."

Several therapeutic drugs have been introduced to slow the progression of AD by targeting the above-mentioned pathways. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that naturally occurring compounds have the potential to serve as adjuvant therapies to alleviate AD symptoms. Carotenoids, a group of natural pigments with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, are proposed to be implicated in neuroprotection. To obtain a comprehensive picture of the effect of carotenoids on AD prevention and development, we critically reviewed and discussed recent evidence from in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and human studies in databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane (CENTRAL). After analyzing the existing evidence, we found that high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking to explore the neuroprotective role of carotenoids in AD pathogenesis and symptoms, especially carotenoids with solid preclinical evidence such as astaxanthin, fucoxanthin, macular carotenoids, and crocin, in order to develop effective preventive dietary supplements for AD patients to ameliorate the symptoms. This review points out directions for future studies to advance the knowledge in this field.",

Many of them are currently used as food supplements. In this review, we have compiled several studies that show microalgal carotenoids inhibit cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, as well as induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various melanoma cell lines. MAPK and NF-ĸB pathway, MMP and apoptotic factors are frequently affected after exposure to microalgal carotenoids. Fucoxanthin, astaxanthin and zeaxanthin are the main carotenoids investigated, in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models.

Carotenoid utilization is deemed a possible strategy for treating AMD. Cordyceps militaris has advantages like immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative characteristics. This paper assessed the possible protective influence of carotenoids obtained by isolating and purifying the Cordyceps militaris (CMCT) into human RPE cells (ARPE-19) damaged by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The findings demonstrated that CMCT safeguarded the ARPE-19 cells against the damage and apoptosis caused by H2O2 and oxidative stress via Bcl-2 protein upregulation, as well as the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein. In addition, CMCT treatment increased cell survival and restricted the generation of H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the protein expression of NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1). Additionally, the CMCT treatment of H2O2-induced ARPE-19 cells ameliorated high malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in oxidative stress-induced cells. The catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH) returned to standard levels, which were governed by the higher expression of nuclear Nrf2 protein in the ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, this study showed that CMCT safeguarded the ARPE-19 cells against the damage caused by oxidative stress via its antioxidant activity and antiapoptotic functionality, suggesting the potential therapeutic role of CMCT in AMD prevention and mitigation."

In this study, melatonin (MLT), a widely used plant growth regulator, was added to the autotrophic medium of Dunaliella bardawil to explore its effects on the growth and pigment accumulation of Dunaliella bardawil. The results showed that the induction of exogenous MLT alone was not beneficial to the growth and pigment accumulation of Dunaliella bardawil, and the higher the concentration, the more obvious the inhibitory effect on the algal cells. Therefore, a strategy to promote carotenoid accumulation in Dunaliella bardawil by combining exogenous MLT and light induction was carried out. Under 4500 LUX light intensity, the content of zeaxanthin was significantly increased under exogenous MLT induction. In the 200 μg/mL, 300 μg/mL, and 400 μg/mL MLT-treated groups, the zeaxanthin single-cell content in the 300 μg/mL-treated group was as high as 0.38 ng/mL (0.17 ng/mL in the control group), which was 1.24-fold higher compared to the control. Under 9500 LUX light intensity, all carotenoids showed an increasing trend in all experimental groups, except for zeaxanthin, which showed a decreasing trend. The effect of 300 μg/mL showed the most obvious in the 200 μg/mL,300 μg/mL, and 400 μg/mL MLT treatment groups, where the lutein, α-carotene and β-carotene contents were 1.24, 1.14 and 1.31 times higher than those of the control group, respectively. Overall, exogenous MLT at high light intensities had a significant effect on pigment accumulation in Dunaliella bardawil.",

      "abstract": "Among the thyroid cancers, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounts for 90% of the cases. In addition to the necessity to identify new targets for PTC treatment, early diagnosis and management are highly demanded. Previous data indicated that the multivariate statistical analysis of the Raman spectra allows the discrimination of healthy tissues from PTC ones; this is characterized by bands typical of carotenoids. Here, we dissected the molecular effects of carotenoid accumulation in PTC patients by analyzing whether they were required to provide increased retinoic acid (RA) synthesis and signaling and/or to sustain antioxidant functions. HPLC analysis revealed the lack of a significant difference in the overall content of carotenoids. For this reason, we wondered whether the carotenoid accumulation in PTC patients could be related to vitamin A derivative retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis and, consequently, the RA-related pathway activation. The transcriptomic analysis performed using a dedicated PCR array revealed a significant downregulation of RA-related pathways in PTCs, suggesting that the carotenoid accumulation in PTC could be related to a lower metabolic conversion into RA compared to that of healthy tissues. In addition, the gene expression profile of 474 PTC cases previously published in the framework of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) project was examined by hierarchical clustering and heatmap analyses. This metanalysis study indicated that the RA-related pathways resulted in being significantly downregulated in PTCs and being associated with the follicular variant of PTC (FV-PTC). To assess whether the possible fate of the carotenoids accumulated in PTCs is associated with the oxidative stress response, the expression of enzymes involved in ROS scavenging was checked. An increased oxidative stress status and a reduced antioxidant defense response were observed in PTCs compared to matched healthy thyroids; this was possibly associated with the prooxidant effects of high levels of carotenoids. Finally, the DepMap datasets were used to profile the levels of 225 metabolites in 12 thyroid cancer cell lines. The results obtained suggested that the high carotenoid content in PTCs correlates with tryptophan metabolism. This pilot provided novel possible markers and possible therapeutic targets for PTC diagnosis and therapy. For the future, a larger study including a higher number of PTC patients will be necessary to further validate the molecular data reported here."

      "abstract": "The carotenoids, including lycopene, lutein, astaxanthin, and zeaxanthin belong to the isoprenoids, whose basic structure is made up of eight isoprene units, resulting in a C40 backbone, though some of them are only trace components in Euglena. They are essential to all photosynthetic organisms due to their superior photoprotective and antioxidant properties. Their dietary functions decrease the risk of breast, cervical, vaginal, and colorectal cancers and cardiovascular and eye diseases. Antioxidant functions of carotenoids are based on mechanisms such as quenching free radicals, mitigating damage from reactive oxidant species, and hindering lipid peroxidation. With the development of carotenoid studies, their distribution, functions, and composition have been identified in microalgae and higher plants. Although bleached or achlorophyllous mutants of Euglena were among the earliest carotenoid-related microalgae under investigation, current knowledge on the composition and biosynthesis of these compounds in Euglena is still elusive. This review aims to overview what is known about carotenoid metabolism in Euglena, focusing on the carotenoid distribution and structure, biosynthesis pathway, and accumulation in Euglena strains and mutants under environmental stresses and different culture conditions. Moreover, we also summarize the potential applications in therapy preventing carcinogenesis, cosmetic industries, food industries, and animal feed.",

      "abstract": "Pulsed light (PL) is proposed as a novel strategy for the food industry to enhance the antioxidant potential of fruits and vegetables for industrial uses. The main aim of this work is to evaluate the impact of postharvest PL treatments of different spectral ranges on the carotenoid concentration as well as quality attributes of tomatoes during post-treatment time. Doses of wide-spectrum light (180-1100 nm), full-spectrum without ultraviolet (UV)-C wavelengths (305-1100 nm), and visible (VIS) + near-infrared light (NIR) (400-1100 nm) were compared. Total carotenoids, lycopene, and chlorophyll contents were spectrophotometrically assessed just after treatments and 1, 5, and 10 days post-treatment. PL treatments accelerated the accumulation of both total carotenoids and lycopene concentrations in tomato fruits. Nevertheless, the efficacy of PL depended on the applied spectral range. Tomato subjected to VIS + NIR treatment exhibited the greatest enhancement in total carotenoids (31 %) and lycopene (35 %) content at day 5 post-treatment and quality attributes were not affected. Conversely, UV-light exposure did not enhance carotenoid concentrations. These results evidenced that VIS + NIR treatments induced a faster accumulation of carotenoids without negatively affecting tomato quality attributes. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The integration of visible and near-infrared (VIS + NIR) light filters in pulsed light (PL) processing allows enhancing the accumulation of bioactive compounds in tomato tissues in a sustainable way, which can be processed to obtain derived products (e.g., juices, purees) with health-promoting properties. PL technology is characterized by a lack of residual compounds and the absence of applying chemicals potentially harmful to humans. Industries can attract the attention of consumers through their application, which allows offering this added value.",

Palliative care provided to patients with an incurable disease is aimed at improving the patient's quality of life through appropriate treatment of symptoms accompanying the disease. Palliative care patients with burdensome symptoms related to advanced-stage cancers are especially interested in the use of natural dietary supplements and herbal remedies to reduce symptoms' intensity and ameliorate the quality of life. Carotenoids seem to be a group of natural compounds with particularly promising properties in relieving symptoms, mainly due to their strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Moreover, carotenoids have been used in folk medicine to treat various diseases and alleviate the accompanying symptoms. In this narrative review, the authors decided to determine whether there is any scientific evidence supporting the rationale for carotenoid supplementation in advanced-stage cancer patients, with particular emphasis on the adjuvant treatment of cancer-related symptoms, such as neuropathic pain and cancer-related cachexia.",

The implementation of new, less energy-consuming vegetable production systems using artificial light such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is essential. In the present study, pak choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis 'Black Behi') sprouts were grown under a combination of blue and white LEDs, red and white LEDs or only white LEDs for 7 days. Total carotenoid levels of ~ 700 ng/mg DM were measured under white LEDs. The combination of blue and white LEDs increased the carotenoid levels by ~ 15% in comparison to only white LEDs, while red and white LEDs reduced them. The transcript levels of important carotenoid metabolism-related genes were enhanced under blue and white LEDs. Phytoene measurement after Norflurazon-treatment, a phytoene desaturase inhibitor, revealed that phytoene increased by 38% (37.5 µM Norflurazon) and by 56% (50.0 µM Norflurazon) after growth under blue and white LEDs in comparison to only white LEDs suggesting an up-regulation of the upper carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Thus, the transcript levels and the enhanced phytoene levels correlated well with the higher accumulation of carotenoids under blue and white LEDs. Furthermore, a comparison to sprouts grown under blue LEDs without additional white LEDs showed that blue light alone does not increase the phytoene levels after Norflurazon-treatment. Overall, this study demonstrated a beneficial effect of a higher blue light percentage in growing carotenoid-rich pak choi sprouts, and implies that an increased biosynthesis within the upper carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is responsible for the enhanced carotenoid accumulation.",

The aim of the current work was to examine the effects of crocins (CRCs) and their methyl ester derivate dimethylcrocetin (DMCRT) on glioblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, in terms of cytotoxicity and gene expression, implicated in proapoptotic and cell survival pathways. Cell cytotoxicity was assessed with Alamar Blue fluorescence assay after treatment with saffron carotenoids for 24, 48 and 72 h and concentrations ranging from 22.85 to 0.18 mg/mL for CRCs and 11.43 to 0.09 mg/mL for DMCRT. In addition, BAX, BID, BCL2, MYCN, SOD1, and GSTM1 gene expression was studied by qRT-PCR analysis. Both compounds demonstrated cytotoxic effects against glioblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. They induced apoptosis, via BAX and BID upregulation, MYCN and BCL-2, SOD1, GSTM1 downregulation. The current research denotes the possible anticancer properties of saffron carotenoids, which are considered safe phytochemicals, already tested in clinical trials for their health promoting properties."

Under this hypothesis, ketocarotenoid metabolism shares cellular pathways with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation such that red carotenoid-based coloration is inextricably linked mitochondrial function. To test this hypothesis, we exposed Tigriopus californicus copepods to a mitochondrially targeted protonophore, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), to induce proton leak in the inner mitochondrial membranes. We then measured whole-animal metabolic rate and ketocarotenoid accumulation. As observed in prior studies of vertebrates, we observed that DNP treatment of copepods significantly increased respiration and that DNP-treated copepods accumulated more ketocarotenoid than control animals. Moreover, we observed a relationship between ketocarotenoid concentration and metabolic rate, and this association was strongest in DNP-treated copepods. These data support the hypothesis that ketocarotenoid and mitochondrial metabolism are biochemically intertwined. Moreover, these results corroborate observations in vertebrates, perhaps suggesting a fundamental connection between ketocarotenoid pigmentation and mitochondrial function that should be explored further.",

      "abstract": "Carotenoids are essential pigments widely distributed in tissues and organs of higher plants, contributing to color, photosynthesis, photoprotection, nutrition, and flavor in plants. White- or yellow-fleshed colors in peach were determined by expression of carotenoids cleavage dioxygenase (PpCCD) genes, catalyzing the degradation of carotenoids. The cracked volatile apocarotenoids are the main contributors to peach aroma and flavor with low sensory threshold concentration. However, the detailed regulatory roles of carotenoids metabolism genes remained unclear under UV-B irradiation. In our study, metabolic balance between carotenoids and apocarotenoids was regulated by the expression of phytoene synthase (PSY), β-cyclase (LCY-B), ε-cyclase (LCY-E), and PpCCD4 under UV-B irradiation. The transcript levels of PpPSY, PpLCY-B, PpLCY-E, and PpCHY-B were elevated 2- to 10-fold compared with control, corresponding to a nearly 30% increase of carotenoids content after 6 h UV-B irradiation. Interestingly, the total carotenoids content decreased by nearly 60% after 48 h of storage, while UV-B delayed the decline of lutein and β-carotene. The transcript level of PpLCY-E increased 17.83-fold compared to control, partially slowing the decline rate of lutein under UV-B irradiation. In addition, the transcript level of PpCCD4 decreased to 30% of control after 48 h UV-B irradiation, in accordance with the dramatic reduction of apocarotenoid volatiles and the delayed decrease of β-carotene. Besides, β-ionone content was elevated by ethylene treatment, and accumulation dramatically accelerated at full ripeness. Taken together, UV-B radiation mediated the metabolic balance of carotenoid biosynthesis and catabolism by controlling the transcript levels of PpPSY, PpLCY-B, PpLCY-E, and PpCCD4 in peach, and the transcript level of PpCCD4 showed a positive relationship with the accumulation of β-ionone during the ripening process. However, the detailed catalytic activity of PpCCD4 with various carotenoid substrates needs to be studied further, and the key transcript factors involved in the regulation of metabolism between carotenoids and apocarotenoids need to be clarified."

      "abstract": "Blood cancers are characterized by pathological disorders causing uncontrolled hematological cell division. Various strategies were previously explored for the treatment of blood cancers, including chemotherapy, Car-T therapy, targeting chimeric antigen receptors, and platelets therapy. However, all these therapies pose serious challenges that limit their use in blood cancer therapy, such as poor metabolism. Furthermore, the solubility and stability of anticancer drugs limit efficacy and bio-distribution and cause toxicity. The isolation and purification of natural killer cells during Car-T cell therapy is a major challenge. To cope with these challenges, treatment strategies from phyto-medicine scaffolds have been evaluated for blood cancer treatments. Carotenoids represent a versatile class of phytochemical that offer therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of cancer, and specifically blood cancer. Carotenoids, through various signaling pathways and mechanisms, such as the activation of AMPK, expression of autophagy biochemical markers (p62/LC3-II), activation of Keap1-Nrf2/EpRE/ARE signaaling pathway, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), increased level of reactive oxygen species, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP), c-caspase-3, -7, decreased level of Bcl-xL, cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and decreasing STAT3 expression results in apoptosis induction and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. This review article focuses the therapeutic potential of carotenoids in blood cancers, addressing various mechanisms and signaling pathways that mediate their therapeutic efficacy.",

      "abstract": "The current COVID-19 pandemic is severely threatening public healthcare systems around the globe. Some supporting therapies such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and ivermectin are still under the process of a clinical trial, it is thus urgent to find alternative treatment and prevention options for SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, although many natural products have been tested and/or suggested for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19, carotenoids as an important class of natural products were underexplored. The dietary supplementation of some carotenoids was already suggested to be potentially effective in the treatment of COVID-19 due to their strong antioxidant properties. In this study, we performed an in silico screening of common food-derived carotenoids against druggable target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including main protease, helicase, replication complex, spike protein and its mutants for the recent variants of concern, and ADP-ribose phosphatase. Molecular docking results revealed that some of the carotenoids had low binding energies toward multiple receptors. Particularly, crocin had the strongest binding affinity (-10.5 kcal/mol) toward the replication complex of SARS-CoV-2 and indeed possessed quite low binding energy scores for other targets as well. The stability of crocin in the corresponding receptors was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Our study, therefore, suggests that carotenoids, especially crocin, can be considered an effective alternative therapeutics and a dietary supplement candidate for the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, food-derived carotenoids as dietary supplements have the potential to be used for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico techniques, we aimed at discovering food-derived carotenoids with inhibitory effects against multiple druggable sites of SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking experiments against main protease, helicase, replication complex, spike protein and its mutants for the recent variants of concern, and ADP-ribose phosphatase resulted in a few carotenoids with multitarget inhibitory effects. Particularly, crocin as one of the main components of saffron exhibited strong binding affinities to the multiple drug targets including main protease, helicase, replication complex, mutant spike protein of lineage B.1.351, and ADP-ribose phosphatase. The stability of the crocin complexed with these drug targets was further confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, our study provides the preliminary data for the potential use of food-derived carotenoids, particularly crocin, as dietary supplements in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

The purpose of the current study was to further explore the effects of phosphatidylcholine (PC) provided by eggs versus a choline bitartrate (CB) supplement on the gut microbiota, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) formation, and plasma carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin in MetS. This randomized, controlled crossover clinical trial included 23 subjects with MetS. Following a washout period of 2 weeks without consuming any choline-containing foods, subjects were randomly allocated to consume either three eggs/d or a CB supplement for 4 weeks (both diets had a choline equivalent of 400 mg/day). DNA was extracted from stool samples to sequence the 16S rRNA gene region for community analysis. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the α-diversity of the community were determined using QIIME software. Plasma TMAO, methionine, betaine, and dimethylglycine (DMG) were quantified by stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma carotenoids, lutein, and zeaxanthin were measured using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. There were significant increases in plasma lutein and zeaxanthin after egg intake compared to the baseline or intake of CB supplement (p < 0.01). In contrast, TMAO was not different between treatments compared to the baseline (p > 0.05). Additionally, while diet intervention had no effects on microbiota diversity measures or relative taxa abundances, a correlation between bacterial biodiversity and HDL was observed. Following egg intake, the observed increases in plasma lutein and zeaxanthin may suggest additional protection against oxidative stress, a common condition in MetS.",

      "abstract": "Head and neck cancer (HNC) is one of the most common cancers in the world according to GLOBCAN. In 2018, it was reported that HNC accounts for approximately 3% of all human cancers (51,540 new cases) and is the cause of nearly 1.5% of all cancer deaths (10,030 deaths). Despite great advances in treatment, HNC is indicated as a leading cause of death worldwide. In addition to having a positive impact on general health, a diet rich in carotenoids can regulate stages in the course of carcinogenesis; indeed, strong epidemiological associations exist between dietary carotenoids and HNS, and it is presumed that diets with carotenoids can even reduce cancer risk. They have also been proposed as potential chemotherapeutic agents and substances used in chemoprevention of HNC. The present review discusses the links between dietary carotenoids and HNC. It examines the prospective anticancer effect of dietary carotenoids against intracellular cell signalling and mechanisms, oxidative stress regulation, as well as their impact on apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemoprevention; it also provides an overview of the limited preclinical and clinical research published in this arena. Recent epidemiological, key opinion-forming systematic reviews, cross-sectional, longitudinal, prospective, and interventional studies based on in vitro and animal models of HNC also indicate that high carotenoid content obtained from daily supplementation has positive effects on the initiation, promotion, and progression of HNC. This article presents these results according to their increasing clinical credibility.",

      "abstract": "An increasing number of people experience disorders related to the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, new forms of therapy, which may be helpful in repairing processes' enhancement and restoring declined brain functions, are constantly being sought. One of the most relevant physiological processes occurring in the brain for its entire life is neuroplasticity. It has tremendous significance concerning CNS disorders since neurological recovery mainly depends on restoring its structural and functional organization. The main factors contributing to nerve tissue damage are oxidative stress and inflammation. Hence, marine carotenoids, abundantly occurring in the aquatic environment, being potent antioxidant compounds, may play a pivotal role in nerve cell protection. Furthermore, recent results revealed another valuable characteristic of these compounds in CNS therapy. By inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, carotenoids promote synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, consequently presenting neuroprotective activity. Therefore, this paper focuses on the carotenoids obtained from marine sources and their impact on neuroplasticity enhancement.",

      "abstract": "The increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains contributes to the reduced risk of many diseases related to metabolic syndrome, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and cancer. Citrus, the genus Citrus L., is one of the most important fruit crops, rich in carotenoids, flavonoids, terpenes, limonoids, and many other bioactive compounds of nutritional and nutraceutical value. Moreover, polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), a unique class of bioactive flavonoids, abundantly occur in citrus fruits. In addition, citrus essential oil, rich in limonoids and terpenes, is an economically important product due to its potent antioxidant, antimicrobial, and flavoring properties. Mechanistic, observational, and intervention studies have demonstrated the health benefits of citrus bioactives in minimizing the risk of metabolic syndrome. This review provides a comprehensive view of the composition of carotenoids, flavonoids, terpenes, and limonoids of citrus fruits and their associated health benefits."

A total of 150 mature 8-wk of age Japanese quails (100 females and 50 males) were allocated into 5 treatment groups, with 5 replicates, each of 6 quails (4 females and 2 males). The experimental diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous, based on corn and soybean meal, and included 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12% of tomato pomace, respectively. The results showed that dietary supplementation of tomato pomace up to 12% significantly improved the immune response, antioxidant response, and digestive enzymes of Japanese quail breeders, significantly decreased cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Also, TP increased egg weight, egg mass and hatchability , where TP 6% had the greatest egg weight, egg mass and hatchability among other groups. Moreover, tomato pomace inclusion significantly had a positive effect on the deposition of lycopene into the egg yolk and it can be used as a good delivery system to improve human health. Tomato pomace up to 12% could be used as an alternative feedstuff in quail breeders' diets.",

Due to the complex composition of the biological samples, the efficient sample preparation is the key to the analysis. We report here a surface active ionic liquid (SAIL)-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) method coupled with a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine four fat-soluble vitamins and six carotenoids in human serum simultaneously. Liquid crystal structures were formed in the extract phase. And the enrichment factor of the analytes treated by DLLME was 4 to 26 times of the traditional LLE method except lycopene. The limit of determination for these compounds was determined to be between 0.002 and 0.076 µg/mL. The accuracy was validated by the standard addition method with recoveries ranging from 82.4 to 114.1%. The intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations were 2.76-12.63% and 4.01-13.54%, respectively. The proposed DLLME coupled with the HPLC method was successfully applied in the determination of fat-soluble micronutrients in human serum.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis have various disease-specific causal factors and pathological features. A very common characteristic of NDs is oxidative stress (OS), which takes place due to the elevated generation of reactive oxygen species during the progression of NDs. Furthermore, the pathological condition of NDs including an increased level of protein aggregates can further lead to chronic inflammation because of the microglial activation. Carotenoids (CTs) are naturally occurring pigments that play a significant role in averting brain disorders. More than 750 CTs are present in nature, and they are widely available in plants, microorganisms, and animals. CTs are accountable for the red, yellow, and orange pigments in several animals and plants, and these colors usually indicate various types of CTs. CTs exert various bioactive properties because of its characteristic structure, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Due to the protective properties of CTs, levels of CTs in the human body have been markedly linked with the prevention and treatment of multiple diseases including NDs. In this review, we have summarized the relationship between OS, neuroinflammation, and NDs. In addition, we have also particularly focused on the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties of CTs in the management of NDs.",

Flavonoids and carotenoids are the two main types of antioxidant phytochemicals. This study investigated the association between flavonoid and carotenoid intake and depressive symptoms in middle-aged Korean females. We analyzed the mechanism of these associations using an in silico method. Depressive symptoms were screened using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and flavonoid and carotenoid intake were assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Using a multivariate logistic regression model, we found that flavones, anthocyanins, individual phenolic compounds, lycopene, and zeaxanthin were negatively associated with depressive symptoms. In silico analysis showed that most flavonoids have high docking scores for monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), which are two important drug targets in depression. The results of the docking of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and carotenoids suggested the possibility of allosteric activation of BDNF by carotenoids. These results suggest that dietary flavonoids and carotenoids can be utilized in the treatment of depressive symptoms."

      "abstract": "Carotenoids are naturally occurring pigments whose presence in the diet is beneficial to human health. Moreover, they have a wide range of applications in the food, cosmetic, and animal feed industries. As carotenoids contain multiple conjugated double bonds in the molecule, a large number of geometric (E/Z, trans/cis) isomers are theoretically possible. In general, (all-E)-carotenoids are the most predominant geometric isomer in nature, and they have high crystallinity and low solubility in various mediums, resulting in their low processing efficiency and bioavailability. Technological developments for improving the processing efficiency and bioavailability of carotenoids utilizing the Z-isomerization have recently been gaining traction. Namely, Z-isomerization of carotenoids induces a significant change in their physicochemical properties (e.g., solubility and crystallinity), leading to improved processing efficiency and bioavailability as well as several biological activities. For the practical use of isomerization technology for carotenoids, the development of efficient isomerization methods and an acute understanding of the changes in biological activity are required. This review highlights the recent advancements in various conventional and unconventional methods for carotenoid isomerization, such as thermal treatment, light irradiation, microwave irradiation, and catalytic treatment, as well as environment-friendly isomerization methods. Current progress in the improvement of processing efficiency and biological activity utilizing isomerization technology and an application development of carotenoid Z-isomers for the feed industry are also described. In addition, future research challenges in the context of carotenoid isomerization have been elaborated upon.",

Cellular uptake of carotenoids, the expression of carotenoid transporters, the ROS scavenging ability, and antioxidant enzymes activities were compared in HUVEC, Caco-2, and L-02 cells. Combinations with flavonoids in the majority showed stronger antioxidant activity. Lycopene combined with quercetin at ratio 1:5 showed stronger ROS scavenging activities, increased 18, 12, and 12 Cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) units in HUVEC, Caco-2, and L-02 cells, respectively, and promoted SOD and CAT activities than individual component. The cell uptake of carotenoids was enhanced by flavonoids in antioxidant synergistic groups, while dampened by flavonoids in antagonistic groups in HUVEC cells. The synergistic group (lycopene:quercetin = 1:5) increased lycopene uptake by 271%, while antagonistic group (lutein:quercetin = 5:1) decreased lutein uptake by 17%. Flavonoids modulated the effects of carotenoids on the expression of active transporters scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) or Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1). The synergistic group (lycopene:quercetin = 1:5) increased the expression of SR-BI compared to individual lycopene treatment in HUVEC and Caco-2 cells. Thus, a diet rich in both flavonoids and lycopene possesses a great antioxidant activity, especially if a higher amount of flavonoids is included."

      "abstract": "Skin ageing is influenced by several factors including environmental exposure and hormonal changes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which mediate many of the effects of these factors, induce inflammatory processes in the skin and increase the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in dermal fibroblasts, which leads to collagen degradation. Several studies have shown the protective role of estrogens and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables on skin physiology. Previous studies have shown that dietary carotenoids and polyphenols activate the cell's antioxidant defense system by increasing antioxidant response element/Nrf2 (ARE/Nrf2) transcriptional activity and reducing the inflammatory response. The aim of the current study was to examine the protective effect of such dietary-derived compounds and estradiol on dermal fibroblasts under oxidative stress induced by H2O2. Human dermal fibroblasts were used to study the effect of H2O2 on cell number and apoptosis, MMP-1, and pro-collagen secretion as markers of skin damage. Treatment of cells with H2O2 led to cell death, increased secretion of MMP-1, and decreased pro-collagen secretion. Pre-treatment with tomato and rosemary extracts, and with estradiol, reversed the effects of the oxidative stress. This was associated with a reduction in intracellular ROS levels, probably through the measured increased activity of ARE/Nrf2. Conclusions: This study indicates that carotenoids, polyphenols, and estradiol protect dermal fibroblasts from oxidative stress-induced damage through a reduction in ROS levels."

In a randomized intervention trial involving 22 healthy individuals, we administered for two weeks in a crossover manner the whole biomass of PT (5.3 g/day), or fish oil (FO) containing equal amounts of EPA and DHA (together 300 mg/day). In an additional experiment, sea fish at 185 g/week resulting in a similar EPA and DHA intake was administered in nine individuals. We determined the bioavailability of fatty acids and carotenoids and assessed safety parameters. The intake of PT resulted in a similar increase in the n-3 PUFA and EPA content and a decrease in the PUFA n-6:n-3 ratio in plasma. PT intake caused an uptake of FX that is metabolized to fucoxanthinol (FXOH) and amarouciaxanthin A (AxA). No relevant adverse effects occurred following PT consumption. The study shows that PT is a safe and effective source of EPA and FX-and likely other nutrients-and therefore should be considered as a future sustainable food item.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activities of carotenoids, especially toward lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses. As such, there are few reports on the evaluation and comparison of the anti-inflammatory activities of carotenoids against inflammation induced by other stimuli. In this study, we used pathogen-associated molecular patterns, proinflammatory cytokines, degenerated proteins, and chemical irritants as inflammatory inducers to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activities of eight different carotenoids. Each carotenoid showed characteristic anti-inflammatory activities; thus, we conducted a multivariate analysis to clarify the differences among them. Unsubstituted β-ring (i.e., provitamin A) and C8-keto structures of carotenoids were found to be crucial for their inhibitory effects on the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and interferon regulatory factors, respectively. Furthermore, we found that β-carotene and echinenone treatment increased intracellular retinoid levels in monocytes and that the retinoids showed the similar activities to β-carotene and echinenone. Taken together, the intake of both provitamin A and C8-keto carotenoids (e.g., siphonaxanthin and fucoxanthin) might be effective in improving the inflammatory status of individuals. A multivariate analysis of anti-inflammatory activities is a useful method for characterizing anti-inflammatory compounds.",

      "abstract": "Persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) fruits are a remarkable source of carotenoids, which have shown protective effects against UV radiation in bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants. The aim of this study was to analyze the photoprotection provided by an acetone extract, rich in carotenoids and obtained from byproducts derived from the persimmon juice industry, against UV-induced cell death in the keratinocyte HaCaT cell line. For this purpose, the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of carotenoid extract, as well as its intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and anti-adhesive activities towards HaCaT cells, were evaluated. The in vitro permeation test provided information about the permeability of the carotenoid extract. Persimmon extracts, rich in carotenoids (PEC), were absorbed by HaCaT keratinocyte cells, which reduced the UV-induced intracellular ROS production in treated cells. Thus, PEC exerted a photoprotective and regenerative effect on UV-irradiated HaCaT cells, and this protection was UV dose-dependent. No cytotoxic effect was observed in HaCaT cultures at the concentration tested. PEC treatment also stimulated the adhesion capacity of skin microbiome to HaCaT cells, while exhibiting a significant anti-adhesive activity against all tested pathogens. In conclusion, PEC showed potential for use as a functional ingredient in skin-care products."

      "abstract": "High pressure processing (HPP) represents a non-thermal preservation technique for the gentle treatment of food products. Information about the impact of HPP on lipophilic food ingredients (e.g., carotenoids, vitamin E) is still limited in more complex matrices such as kale. Both the variation of pressure levels (200-600 MPa) and different holding times (5-40 min) served as HPP parameters. Whereas a slightly decreasing solvent extractability mostly correlated with increasing pressure regimes; the extension of holding times resulted in elevated extract concentrations, particularly at high-pressures up to 600 MPa. Surprisingly, slightly increasing bioaccessibility correlated with both elevated pressures and extended holding times, indicating matrix-dependent processes during in vitro digestion, compared to results of extractability. Moreover, the verification of syringe filters for digest filtration resulted in the highest relative recoveries using cellulose acetate and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The α-tocopherol equivalent antioxidant capacity (αTEAC) and oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) assays of treated kale samples, chopped larger in size, showed increased antioxidant capacities, regarding elevated pressures and extended holding times. Consequently, one may conclude that HPP was confirmed as a gentle treatment technique for lipophilic micronutrients in kale. Nevertheless, it was indicated that sample pre-treatments could affect HP-related processes in food matrices prior to and possibly after HPP."

      "abstract": "Acute inflammation is a key component of the immune system's response to pathogens, toxic agents, or tissue injury, involving the stimulation of defense mechanisms aimed to removing pathogenic factors and restoring tissue homeostasis. However, uncontrolled acute inflammatory response may lead to chronic inflammation, which is involved in the development of many diseases, including cancer. Nowadays, the need to find new potential therapeutic compounds has raised the worldwide scientific interest to study the marine environment. Specifically, microalgae are considered rich sources of bioactive molecules, such as carotenoids, which are natural isoprenoid pigments with important beneficial effects for health due to their biological activities. Carotenoids are essential nutrients for mammals, but they are unable to synthesize them; instead, a dietary intake of these compounds is required. Carotenoids are classified as carotenes (hydrocarbon carotenoids), such as α- and β-carotene, and xanthophylls (oxygenate derivatives) including zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, fucoxanthin, lutein, α- and β-cryptoxanthin, and canthaxanthin. This review summarizes the present up-to-date knowledge of the anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of microalgal carotenoids both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the latest status of human studies for their potential use in prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer.",

      "abstract": "The seriousness and menace of the worldwide weight of 'Alzheimer's disease have been related to a few factors, which incorporate antioxidant system depletion, mutation of proteins, and high expression of cholinesterases due to aging, environmental influence, diet, infectious agents, and hormonal imbalance. Overexpression of cholinesterases has been emphatically connected to 'Alzheimer's disease because of the unreasonable hydrolysis of acetylcholine and butyrylcholine. Certain plant phytochemicals, for example, beta-carotenoids, lutein, neoxanthin, and viola-xanthine from Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. Var. esculentum (ESC) and Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. Var. cerasiforme (CER) has been utilized altogether as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of 'Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this research sought to investigate the drug-likeness of the individual carotenoids as detailed for cholinesterase inhibition in the treatment of 'Alzheimer's disease. Four potential cholinesterase inhibitors from ESC and CER were retrieved from the PubChem database. Investigation of their drug-likeness, toxicity prediction, molecular docking, and dynamic simulations were carried out using Molinspiration, PreADMET V.2.0, Patchdock server, and Schrodinger Maestro software respectively. Neoxanthin was ranked the safest with a greater tendency to inhibit the cholinesterases with high binding affinity. In addition, its stability after simulation in a mimicked biological environment suggests its relevance as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of 'Alzheimer's disease through the inhibition of cholinesterases.",

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. As the risk of breast cancer is dependent on various lifestyle factors such as dietary modifications, there is increasing interest surrounding the anti-cancerous properties of vitamin A and carotenoids. Despite the suggested protective roles of vitamin A and carotenoids in breast cancer development, their clinical application for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer is limited. In this narrative review, we discuss the roles of vitamin A and carotenoids along with the evaluation method of vitamin A status. We also exhibit the association of genetic variations involved in metabolism of vitamin A and carotenoids with cancers and other diseases. We demonstrate the epidemiological evidence for the relationship of vitamin A and carotenoids with breast cancer risk, their effects on cancer mechanism, and the recent updates in clinical practice of vitamin A or carotenoids as a potential therapeutic agent against breast cancer. This review provides insight into the preventive and therapeutic roles of vitamin A and carotenoids in breast cancer development and progression.",

All cooking techniques cause changes in a vegetable's the nutrient content. Consumers are increasingly health-conscious and have less time to prepare meals, and they do not know which cooking times and cooking methods are best suited to preserve the nutrients. This study aimed to determine the best method of cooking vegetables to maintain minerals (potassium and sodium) and carotenoids. The studied vegetables were broccoli (Brassica oleracea, var. Italica), carrots (Daucus carota), and zucchini (Cucurbita moschata). The cooking methods were: boiling, steaming, combined oven, microwave steaming, and microwave cooking. Samples of organic and conventionally grown vegetables were prepared in triplicate. Samples were analyzed to determine the availability of target minerals and carotenoids in the raw food and in each recommended cooking situation according to technical standards. Only the carrot showed a higher concentration in organic cultivation for carotenoids in raw vegetables, with both zucchini and broccoli having higher concentrations when grown by conventional cultivation. The zucchini from organic cultivation presented a reduction of potassium and sodium, almost consistently, in all cooking techniques. Regarding the conventionally cultivated zucchini, potassium remained stable in boiling. Broccoli from organic and conventional cultivation showed similar potassium levels for boiling and traditional steam cooking. Organic carrots showed easier sodium extraction compared with conventional cultivation. Heat treatment, in general, improves the accessibility of carotenoids."

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains a leading cause of modifiable vision loss in older adults. Chronic oxidative injury and compromised antioxidant defenses represent essential drivers in the development of retinal neurodegeneration. Overwhelming free radical species formation results in mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as cellular and metabolic imbalance, which becomes exacerbated with increasing age. Thus, the depletion of systemic antioxidant capacity further proliferates oxidative stress in AMD-affected eyes, resulting in loss of photoreceptors, neuroinflammation, and ultimately atrophy within the retinal tissue. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the neuroprotective potential of the xanthophyll carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin on retinal neurodegeneration for the purpose of adjunctive nutraceutical strategy in the management of AMD. A comprehensive literature review was performed to retrieve 55 eligible publications, using four database searches from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science. Epidemiology studies indicated an enhanced risk reduction against late AMD with greater dietary consumption of carotenoids, meanwhile greater concentrations in macular pigment demonstrated significant improvements in visual function among AMD patients. Collectively, evidence strongly suggests that carotenoid vitamin therapies offer remarkable synergic protection in the neurosensory retina, with the potential to serve as adjunctive nutraceutical therapy in the management of established AMD, albeit these benefits may vary among different stages of disease."

Inhibition of VEGF and VEGFR-2 provides a great therapeutic option in the management of cancer. This study employed VEGFR-2 kinase domain inhibition as an anti-angiogenic scaffold and further validate the anti-angiogenic effects of the lead phytochemicals, carotenoids from Spondias mombin in 7, 12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) model of breast carcinoma in Wistar rats. Phytochemicals characterized from 6 reported anti-cancer plants were screened against the VEGFR-2 kinase domain. The lead phytochemicals, carotenoids from Spondias mombin were isolated and subjected to Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) for characterization. The anti-angiogenic potentials of the carotenoid isolates were validated in the DMBA model of breast carcinoma in female Wistar rats through assessment of the expression of anti-angiogenic related mRNAs, histopathological analysis, and molecular docking. Treatment with carotenoid isolates (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) downregulated the expression of VEGF, VEGFR, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1(HIF-1), and Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) mRNAs in the mammary tumours, while the expression of Chromodomain Helicase DNA-Binding Protein-1 (CHD-1) mRNA was significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated. DMBA induced comedo and invasive ductal subtypes of breast carcinoma. The binding of astaxanthin, 7,7',8,8'-tetrahydro-β,β-carotene, and beta-carotene-15,15'-epoxide to the ATP binding site led to the DFG-out conformation with binding energies of -8.2 kcal/mol, -10.3 kcal/mol, and -10.5 kcal/mol respectively. Carotenoid isolates demonstrated anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferating potentials via VEGFR-2 kinase domain inhibition."

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy, which was primarily regarded as a microvascular disease, is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. With obesity at epidemic proportions, diabetes-related ocular problems are exponentially increasing in the developed world. Oxidative stress due to hyperglycemic states and its associated inflammation is one of the pathological mechanisms which leads to depletion of endogenous antioxidants in retina in a diabetic patient. This contributes to a cascade of events that finally leads to retinal neurodegeneration and irreversible vision loss. The xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin are known to promote retinal health, improve visual function in retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration that has oxidative damage central in its etiopathogenesis. Thus, it can be hypothesized that dietary supplements with xanthophylls that are potent antioxidants may regenerate the compromised antioxidant capacity as a consequence of the diabetic state, therefore ultimately promoting retinal health and visual improvement. We performed a comprehensive literature review of the National Library of Medicine and Web of Science databases, resulting in 341 publications meeting search criteria, of which, 18 were found eligible for inclusion in this review. Lutein and zeaxanthin demonstrated significant protection against capillary cell degeneration and hyperglycemia-induced changes in retinal vasculature. Observational studies indicate that depletion of xanthophyll carotenoids in the macula may represent a novel feature of DR, specifically in patients with type 2 or poorly managed type 1 diabetes. Meanwhile, early interventional trials with dietary carotenoid supplementation show promise in improving their levels in serum and macular pigments concomitant with benefits in visual performance. These findings provide a strong molecular basis and a line of evidence that suggests carotenoid vitamin therapy may offer enhanced neuroprotective effects with therapeutic potential to function as an adjunct nutraceutical strategy for management of diabetic retinopathy.",

Recent studies revealed a significant role of carotenoids to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to systematically review the neuroprotective potential of carotenoids in vivo and in vitro and the molecular mechanisms and pathological factors contributing to major neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke). HYPOTHESIS: Carotenoids as therapeutic molecules to target neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: Aggregation of toxic proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, the excitotoxic pathway, and neuroinflammation were the major pathological factors contributing to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies supported the beneficiary role of carotenoids, namely lycopene, β-carotene, crocin, crocetin, lutein, fucoxanthin and astaxanthin in alleviating disease progression. These carotenoids provide neuroprotection by inhibition of neuro-inflammation, microglial activation, excitotoxic pathway, modulation of autophagy, attenuation of oxidative damage and activation of defensive antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, studies conducted on humans also demonstrated that dietary intake of carotenoids lowers the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: Carotenoids may be used as drugs to prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases. Although, the in vitro and in vivo results are encouraging, further well conducted clinical studies on humans are required to conclude about the full potential of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Objective: to evaluate through a prospective nutritional study the effect of carotenoid consumption on cardiometabolic risk biomarkers in peri- and post-menopausal women. Material and methods: twelve peri- and post-menopausal women without previous symptoms of cardiovascular disease, but with some cardiometabolic risk factor, were recruited. Their diet was supplemented during 4 weeks with orange-carrot juice, tomato juice, and boiled spinach, providing 415 mg of total carotenoids/week (carotenes, cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein + zeaxanthin). At the beginning (TI) and at the end (TF) of the intervention period blood samples were drawn to measure biochemical parameters, oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial function biomarkers, and plasma carotenoid levels. Results: at TF a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in LDL-cholesterol and atherogenic index, and an increase in HDL-cholesterol were observed. Plasma carotenoids increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 0.56 µg/mL at TI to 1.22 µg/mL at TF. Concurrently, a shift in oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers was detected, with a decrease in plasma C-reactive protein and malonaldehyde levels, and an increase in adiponectin. However, endothelial dysfunction biomarkers (sVCAM and sICAM) and total antioxidant capacity remained unchanged. Conclusions: dietary supplementation with carotenoids leads to an increase in plasma carotenoids, a decrease in atherogenic dyslipidemia, and an improvement in oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers, which indicates a reduction in cardiometabolic risk.",
