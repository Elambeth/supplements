      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Qi Gong fitness in alleviating stress, anxiety, and depression among underprivileged working youth with a follow-up study. METHODS: Eighty subjects were randomly assigned to normal groups (NG) and treatment groups (TG), with 40 participants in each group. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), and 24-Item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-24) were used to evaluate the effect of Qi Gong fitness on alleviating stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms in underprivileged working youth. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in demographic outcome indicators between NG and TG. The main analytic results showed significant differences (P < .05) in the intra- and inter-group comparisons of NG and TG in stress, anxiety, and depression before and after intervention. When compared with prior intervention, NG and TG after intervention showed more favorable scores in PSS, GAD-7, and HAMD-24, among which PSS (NG: 51.61 ± 4.32 vs. 29.80 ± 3.08; TG: 55.21 ± 5.41 vs. 15.85 ± 2.25; P < .01), GAD-7 (NG: 10.83 ± 2.45 vs. 9.85 ± 2.52; TG: 12.23 ± 1.90 vs. 7.84 ± 1.57; P < .01), and HAMD-24 (NG: 10.83 ± 2.45 vs. 9.85 ± 2.52; TG: 25.63 ± 3.94 vs. 11.40 ± 3.82; P < .01); These results indicate that NG and TG have significant effects on alleviating occupational stress, anxiety, and depression in young underprivileged people. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that Qi Gong fitness had a positive effect on reducing and alleviating stress, anxiety, and depression among young underprivileged professionals. This highlights the potential benefits of incorporating Qi Gong fitness into treatment plans."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of digitally delivered exercise classes to promote physical activity has become widespread amongst various populations as an alternative to in-person activities. OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and participant engagement variables to delivering Qi Gong and Tai Chi programs through telehealth interventions. METHODS: Ten databases (Seven English databases; three Chinese databases) were searched between October and November 2021. Studies published in English or Chinese, or having translations in English or Chinese, were included. Titles and abstracts of identified articles were screened, relevant studies were then retrieved for full-text screening. Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction, data transformation, and data synthesis were completed following a convergent integrated approach to mixed method systematic reviews. RESULTS: Seven articles were included in review. Digital literacy of both participants and providers was found to be a significant hurdle towards digital program implementation. There were no notable issues pertaining to access to an internet connection, participant safety, program costs, or connectivity. A major theme for sustaining program engagement was found to be individual perceived relevance for intervention involvement. Online social involvement was noted to be both a facilitator for participant acceptability and engagement. Overall, participants expressed satisfaction with the use of telehealth, while providers expressed acceptability concerns regarding quality of care. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that planned measures be taken prior to program commencement to decrease digital literacy requirements while also including a participatory approach to encourage uptake. During the program, provision of technical support alongside appropriate social-environmental engagement facilitators would promote sustained adherence.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Initially recorded in Yifang Jijie (an ancient Chinese text), Qi Gong Wan (QGW) is used to treat obese women with infertility. QGW can help promote follicular development and maturation, regulate the balance of serum hormones between testosterone and estradiol, enhance endometrial receptivity, improve waist circumference, and ameliorate insulin resistance. It contains eight herbs: Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Makino (Banxia), Citrus maxima (Burm.) (Juhong), Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf. (Fuling), Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (Baizhu), Cyperus rotundus L. (Xiangfu), Conioselinum anthriscoides 'Chuanxiong' (Chuanxiong), Massa Medicata Fermentata (Shenqu), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC. (Gancao). However, the underlying mechanism of how QGW affects women with PCOS remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: QGW has been widely used to treat PCOS patients with obesity clinically. This study was designed to identify its chemical and pharmacological properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to predict the active compounds, potential targets, and pathways of QGW. Female C57BL/6J mice were injected with letrozole and fed a high-fat diet to establish a PCOS-insulin resistance (PCOS-IR) model. Body weight, estrous cycles, ovarian pathology, and serum insulin resistance were measured. qRT-PCR was used to examine the inflammation-related and steroid hormone biosynthesis-related mRNA expression in adipose tissue. Western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and Cyp1b1 in adipose tissue. Molecular docking was used to reveal the key chemical compounds of QGW. RESULTS: Network pharmacology revealed a total of 91 active ingredients in QGW that were associated with 167 targets. QGW could potentially treat PCOS-IR via nitrogen metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and ovarian steroidogenesis pathways. In the PCOS-IR mouse model, we found that QGW decreased the mean diameter of adipocytes and the total adipocyte area. Furthermore, QGW was found to significantly lower the expression of inflammation-related genes including Tnfɑ and C4a/b and the steroid hormone biosynthesis-related gene Cyp1b1. QGW showed a tendency to improve cystic follicles, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR index in the PCOS-IR mouse model. Combining these findings with the results of KEGG analysis, we conclude that QGW promotes the Nrf2/HO-1/Cyp1b1 pathway to protect adipose tissue under conditions of PCOS. Molecular docking revealed that rutin, nicotiflorin, and baicalein may be the key chemical compounds of QGW through which it improves adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: QGW improved adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in the PCOS-IR mouse model by activating the Nrf2/HO-1/Cyp1b1 pathway to protect adipose tissue. Our work thus provides a new research avenue for the study of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of PCOS.",

Besides, changes in the intestinal flora and the clinical curative effects of Jiawei Qi Gong Wan on phlegm-dampness syndrome in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were evaluated. Patients and Methods. A total of 22 patients with PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome, 21 PCOS patients with nonphlegm-dampness syndrome, and 20 control volunteers were selected for this study. The general index, sex hormone index, fasting blood glucose (FPG), and serum fasting insulin (FINS) were determined in each of the groups. The intestinal flora of each group was determined by the 16s rDNA high-throughput sequencing technique. Besides, the PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome group was treated with Jiawei Qi Gong Wan, and the changes in TCM syndrome, sex hormone index, BMI, WHR, FPG, FINS, HOMA-IR, and intestinal flora were determined before and after treatment. RESULTS: PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome showed characteristics of obesity and insulin resistance. There were several differences in both structure and function of the intestinal flora between PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome, PCOS patients with nonphlegm-dampness syndrome, and the control group. An imbalance in the intestinal flora may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome and also has a specific influence on glucose and lipid metabolism, obesity, and the menstrual cycle in PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome. Besides, the imbalance is associated with a decrease in the number of butyrate-producing bacteria, an increase in the number of lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria, and an increase in proinflammatory bacteria. The intestinal flora in PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome was found to be linked to obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperandrogenemia. Treatment with Jiawei Qi Gong Wan was found to increase the diversity of intestinal flora, increase the number of intestinal probiotics, and improve the structure and functional genes of intestinal flora which improved the state of insulin resistance, regulated endocrine metabolism, and improved the overall symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal flora imbalance is a key factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome. Besides, Jiawei Qi Gong Wan improves insulin resistance which is linked to the status of the intestinal flora in PCOS patients with phlegm-dampness syndrome."

      "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms, including pain, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, and depression to name a few, are increasingly recognized and often just as disabling at motor symptoms. The mainstay of treatment is dopamine replacement; however, the beneficial effects tend to wane over time with disease progression, and patients often experience motor fluctuations and medication side effects. The lack of a disease-modifying intervention and the shortcomings of traditional symptomatic medications have led many patients to pursue complementary therapies to alleviate motor and non-motor symptoms associated with PD. The term complementary implies that the therapy is used along with conventional medicine and may include supplements, manipulative treatments (chiropractic, massage), exercise-based programs, and mind-body practices. As these practices become more widespread in Western medicine, there is a growing interest in evaluating their effects on a number of medical conditions, PD included. In this review, we provide an update on clinical trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of complementary treatments for patients with PD, specifically focusing on acupuncture, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, yoga, and cannabis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This bibliometric study aimed to systematically and comprehensively summarize the volume, breadth and evidence for clinical research on Qigong. And this bibliometric analysis also can provide the evidence of this field. DESIGN: Bibliometric analysis. METHODS: All types of primary and secondary studies on humans were included: systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, non-randomized controlled clinical studies, case series and case reports. Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Chinese Academic Conference Papers Database and Chinese Dissertation Database, PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched from the date of inception to December 10, 2018. Bibliometric information, such as publication information, disease/condition, Qigong intervention and research results were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 886 clinical studies were identified: including 47 systematic reviews, 705 randomized clinical trials, 116 non-randomized controlled clinical studies, 12 case series and 6 case reports. The studies were conducted in 14 countries. The top 15 diseases/conditions studied were: diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, stroke, cervical spondylosis, lumbar disc herniation, insomnia, knee osteoarthritis, low back pain, and osteoporosis, Coronary heart disease, breast cancer, periarthritis of shoulder, depression, metabolic syndrome. Of the various Qigong exercises reported in these 886 clinical studies, Ba Duan Jin was the most frequently researched in 492 (55.5%) studies, followed by Health Qigong 107 (12.1%), Dao Yin Shu 85 (9.6%), Wu Qin Xi 67 (7.6%) and Yi Jin Jing 66 (7.4%). The most frequently used comparisons in randomized trials were maintaining normal way of life unchanged 149 (18.1%), the remaining controls included conventional treatment, mainly western medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, health education, psychological therapy, Yoga, Tai Chi and other non-drug therapy. The most frequently reported outcomes were physical function, quality of life, symptoms, pain and mental health indicators. Beneficial results from practicing Qigong were reported in 97% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Qigong research publications have been increasing gradually. Reports on study types, participants, Qigong Intervention, and outcomes are diverse and inconsistent. There is an urgent need to develop a set of reporting standards for various interventions of Qigong. Further trials of high methodological quality with sufficient sample size and real world studies are needed to verify the effects of Qigong in health and disease management.",

Hypertensive patients who are resistant or non-adherent to antihypertensive drugs may be easier to manage if they choose alternative non-drug therapies for hypertension, based on this review. METHODS: P: Adults (>18 years), except pregnant women, with essential hypertension. I: Cupping, moxibustion, acupuncture, acupoint stimulation, yoga, meditation, tai chi, Qi gong, Chinese massage, massage, spinal manipulation, biofeedback, device-guided breathing therapy, aromatherapy, music therapy, and relaxation approaches. C: 1. No treatment. 2. Sham therapy. 3. Conventional treatment, including antihypertensive drugs and lifestyle modification (e.g., exercise). O: 1. Change in the incidence of cardiovascular death. 2. Change in the incidence of myocardial infarction. 3. Change in the incidence of stroke. 4. Change in blood pressure (BP). 5. Efficacy rate of BP lowering. 6. Adverse effects (review specific). S: Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, including meta-analyses and assessments of the methodological quality/risk of bias. INFORMATION SOURCES: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane library, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Scientific Journal Database were searched. The bibliographies of the included articles were also searched for relevant systematic reviews. GRADE criteria were used to rate the quality of evidence in systematic reviews considering 6 factors, including risk of bias. RESULTS: This review ultimately included 13 systematic reviews of 14 non-drug therapies (acupuncture, wet cupping, Baduanjin, blood letting, auricular acupuncture, music, massage, Qi gong, moxibustion, relaxation therapies, biofeedback, device-guided breathing, yoga and tai chi) based on the inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was generally low, and weak recommendations were given for most therapies except massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug. Based on the analyzed evidence, massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug could benefit people who want to lower their BP and do not have contraindications for massage and acupuncture plus antihypertensive drug. DISCUSSION/STRENGTH: The GRADE approach makes this review a unique reference for people who are considering the grade of quality of evidence in systematic reviews, the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences and the strength of recommendations to decide which intervention should be used to reduce BP. LIMITATIONS: Many non-drug therapies were excluded due to the low methodological quality of their systematic reviews, and only 14 therapies were evaluated in this review. As no patient-important outcomes were reviewed, surrogate outcomes were used to rate the strength of recommendations. This approach may cause a decrease in evidence quality according to GRADE, but we argue that this is appropriate in the context of this review.",

QG aims to improve posture, respiration, concentration, while RM aims to obtain patient awareness and control of pain perception. We evaluate 2 protocols integrating RM and QG in FMS. METHODS: Thirty FMS patients were assigned to Group 1, treated by RM and then by QG or Group 2, treated by QG and then by RM. In both protocols, patients are treated 7 weeks by each technique (with 1 week interval), and followed up for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed at T0, at end of 1st (T1) and 2nd intervention (T2), at follow-up (FU) by number rating scale (NRS) for sleep quality and pain, Regional Pain Scale (RPS),Tender Points (TPs), FIQ, HAQ, SF36, HADS for anxiety and depression (HADS-a/d). RESULTS: In Group 1 at T1 (after RM), NRS for pain, RPS, FIQ, HAQ were reduced, HADS-a and SF36 ameliorated; at T2 (after QG) FIQ were further reduced and TPs and HADS-d improved; HADS-a and SF36 maintained. In Group 2 at T1 (after QG), NRS for pain, RPS, TPs, FIQ, HAQ, reduced with reduction maintained at T2 (after RM). HADS-a and -d and SF36 ameliorated at T1, with improvement confirmed at T2; sleep quality ameliorated only at T2. Effects of both protocols are similar at T2 and maintained at FU. CONCLUSIONS: In FMS, both protocols improve pain, disability, quality of life, tenderness, anxiety. RM also ameliorates sleep and QG improves depression. Sequential integration of RM and QG is efficacious in FMS.",

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The study included forty-one participants (16 men and 25 women; aged 41-71 years) with elevated blood glucose levels. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to qi-gong intervention or a usual medical care control group. Physical and hematologic measures were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes were indicators of diabetes control (HbA1c, insulin resistance, fasting blood glucose and insulin, and 2-hour blood glucose and insulin) and potential mediators of these (body weight, waist circumference, and leg strength). Data were collected in 2006 and analyzed in 2007 to 2009. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses showed significant between-group differences in favor of the intervention group in weight (p<0.01); waist circumference (p<0.01); leg strength (p<0.01); HbA1c (p<0.05); insulin resistance (p<0.01); and fasting blood insulin (p<0.01) at 12 weeks. Logistic regression analyses showed that the qi-gong intervention was a significant predictor of reduced weight (odds for decreasing by -2 kg=11.14, p<0.01); waist circumference (by -5 cm=22.50, p<0.01); insulin resistance (by -0.2 unit=3.75, p<0.05); and improved leg strength (odds for increasing by 4 stands in 30 seconds=7.00, p<0.01). The effect of the qi-gong intervention on improved insulin resistance was mediated by reduced weight. CONCLUSIONS: The qi-gong intervention was associated with improvements in weight, waist circumference, leg strength, and insulin resistance. The mediation analyses highlight the importance of weight reduction in the control of diabetes. TRIAL REGISTRATION #: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12607000528459.",

Thirty men and 13 women (mean age, 68+/-8 years) were randomized to the intervention protocol or to a wait-list control group. Qi gong training was well tolerated and, compared with baseline, trained patients walked an average 114 meters more (27%) at the end of treatment (P<.001) and 57 meters more (13.7%) 16 weeks later (P=.008). Control subjects showed no variation in functional capacity. These results seem promising and deserve confirmation with further research.",

During chemotherapy process, neutrophils could fall relatively, and side effects could spike to the peak. Therefore, the medical care personnel should prevent the progression of the side effects. This study aimed to examine the effects of Chan-Chuang qi-gong therapy on complete blood counts in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. This study used a quasi-experimental design. The experiment group (n = 32) received a 21-day Chan-Chuang qi-gong therapy, whereas the control group (n = 35) did not. White blood cells, platelet, and hemoglobin were measured on the day before chemotherapy and on days 8, 15, and 22 during chemotherapy. According to this study, there were significant differences in white blood cells (F = 115.76, P <.001), platelets (F = 25.29, P <.001), and hemoglobin (F = 15.39, P <.001) over the 3-week therapy between the experiment and control groups. Chan-Chuang qi-gong therapy may decrease leukopenia in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. It is recommended conducting more studies on qi-gong and then introducing it in clinical nursing practice at an appropriate time to promote quality of nursing care and quality of patient life.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the last decade several studies have shown that patients with coronary artery disease even above the age of 70 can be successfully treated with advanced medical and surgical methods. Unfortunately, rehabilitation programmes for this group are rarely offered. It is important to develop forms of rehabilitation that are adapted to the specific needs of this increasing group of elderly patients. The aim of this randomized study was to investigate whether the combination of Qi Gong and group discussions would increase physical ability for elderly patients > or =73 years with coronary artery disease. METHODS: A total of 95 patients (66 men and 29 women), with documented coronary artery disease, were randomized to an intervention group (n=48) mean age 77+/-3 (73-82) or to a control group (n=47) mean age 78+/-3 (73-84). The intervention groups met weekly over 3 months. The control group got usual care. Physical ability was assessed at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group increased their self-estimated level of physical activity (P=0.011), and their performance in the one-leg stance test for the right leg (P=0.029), co-ordination (P=0.021) and the box-climbing test for right leg (P=0.035). CONCLUSION: A combination of Qi Gong and group discussions appear to be a promising rehabilitation for elderly cardiac patients in terms of improving self-reported physical activity, balance and co-ordination. This could be an option for elderly patients who do not participate in the ordinary cardiac rehabilitation.",

The main posture of Qi Gong training is similar to the recommended posture by low back schools. Qi gong exercises respect basic physiological and ergonomic principles of movement in every way. Qi Gong fulfils the most important criteria for the prevention and therapy of idiopathic low back pain. Qi Gong training requires no special equipment. It is simple and can be undertaken everywhere. A growing number of people have become interested in Qi Gong, and train regularly and effectively. Low back pain rarely occurs in such people, and therefore Qi Gong should be considered as one of the most effective means of prevention.",

In all experiments, Qi treatment was externally applied under monitoring to newly purchased unopened 100 ml bottles of PBS, and the PMN phagocytic activity was assayed by one experimenter in masked, randomized and monitored conditions using a highly sensitive chemiluminescence method. Phagocytic activity data were obtained in triplicate for each sample and then statistically analyzed. The PBS samples Qi-treated by the Qi-gong master and by one of the Qi-gong trainees showed clear stimulation of PMN phagocytic activity which was significant statistically, and this phenomenon was highly reproducible. Out of 10 experiments by the Qi-gong master, only twice did Qi-treatment fail to influence the PBS. The activity of Qi-treated PBS decayed over days or weeks. Furthermore, it was found that Qi-treated PBS had decreased phagocytic stimulatory activity after microwave treatment, but not after autoclave treatment. We also demonstrated that microwave irradiation and infrared laser pulse irradiation have similar effects on PBS as Qi-treatment. The results obtained in this experiment provide evidence of the existence of Qi energy, its ability to influence an electrolyte solution and its biological effect. Furthermore, microwave or infrared laser pulse treatment was found to partly mimic the Qi-treatment of PBS.",

      "abstract": "In December, 1995, the author had the opportunity to observe an elderly psychic healer of East European origin in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This man specialized in cancer treatment by pointing with the fingers of his right hand at his patients, without actually touching them, spending an average of 30 to 40 minutes with each one. The author considered this to be Qi Gong treatment. In March, 1997 the author also observed 2 leading psychic healers in Brazil. One of them, named Rubens Farias, Jr. is a 43 year-old former engineer and computer programmer if European descent, who is commonly known as \"Dr. Fritz III\" because he is believed to be the spirit of Dr. Adolf Fritz, a German physician who died during World War I, operates through him. The other is \"Dr.\" Hirota, a 53 year old former farmer of Japanese decent who lives near Campinas. About 120 kilometers outside of Sao Paulo and treats large numbers of people daily using indirect and/or hand-on healing techniques. On March 6, 1997, when the author visited \"Dr. Fritz III\"'s clinic in Sao Paulo with a group of Brazilian physicians, he was informed the about 1,400 patients had come that day. \"Dr Fritz III\" examined and treated the majority of the patients in less than one minute each, often asking very quick questions and then immediately beginning treatment. Most patients received injections of a dark-brown solution, which, some of the visiting doctors speculated, may be an iodine solution mixed with either alcohol or a local anesthetic. In many patients, he injected this solution near the pathological area or at an acupuncture point near the pathological area. When the needle of the syringe was in the acupuncture pint, he twirled it with his fingers several times and the withdrew it. Minor surgery was performed in about 1/5th of the patients with whom the author observed. Most of the surgical incisions were made on the midline of the tissue over the spine near the pathological area. The clamping of the blood vessels and the closings of the surgical wounds were performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses. Major surgery were done by \"Dr. Fritz III\" who used a rather primitive and unorthodox cutting technique. Except for major surgery, assistance was performed by volunteer nurses, including his wife. After the surgical wounds were closed, gauze band-aids were applied. When the surface of the gauze facing the wound was examined, it showed strong (+) Qi Gong energy according to the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test. Essentially, \"Dr. Fritz III\"'s treatment consists of acupuncture, injection of iodine with other substances near the pathological area, and (+) Qi Gong energy stored gauze which is applied to the acupuncture point, pathological area, or the site of surgery. \"Dr.\" Hirota is another famous psychic healer whom the author was able to meet and observe in practice while in Brazil. \"Dr.\" Hirota has been practicing for over 20 years. He usually sees patients who come to his clinic in the mornings and he claims to treat 1,000 to 2,000 patients daily between 9 AM and 12 noon. His main treatment also appears to be the application of external Qi Gong energy through the fingers of his right-hand, in combination with Shiatsu Massage and a manual procedure resembling chiropractic manipulation.",

      "abstract": "Most frequently encountered causes of intractable pain and intractable medical problems, including headache, post-herpetic neuralgia, tinnitus with hearing difficulty, brachial essential hypertension, cephalic hypertension and hypotension, arrhythmia, stroke, osteo-arthritis, Minamata disease, Alzheimer's disease and neuromuscular problems, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and cancer are often found to be due to co-existence of 1) viral or bacterial infection, 2) localized microcirculatory disturbances, 3) localized deposits of heavy metals, such as lead or mercury, in affected areas of the body, 4) with or without additional harmful environmental electro-magnetic or electric fields from household electrical devices in close vicinity, which create microcirculatory disturbances and reduced acetylcholine. The main reason why medications known to be effective prove ineffective with intractable medical problems, the authors found, is that even effective medications often cannot reach these affected areas in sufficient therapeutic doses, even though the medications can reach the normal parts of the body and result in side effects when doses are excessive. These conditions are often difficult to treat or may be considered incurable in both Western and Oriental medicine. As solutions to these problems, the authors found some of the following methods can improve circulation and selectively enhance drug uptake: 1) Acupuncture, 2) Low pulse repetition rate electrical stimulation (1-2 pulses/second), 3) (+) Qi Gong energy, 4) Soft lasers using Ga-As diode laser or He-Ne gas laser, 5) Certain electro-magnetic fields or rapidly changing or moving electric or magnetic fields, 6) Heat or moxibustion, 7) Individually selected Calcium Channel Blockers, 8) Individually selected Oriental herb medicines known to reduce or eliminate circulatory disturbances. Each method has advantages and limitations and therefore the individually optimal method has to be selected. Applications of (+) Qi Gong energy stored paper or cloth every 4 hours, along with effective medications, were often found to be effective, as Qigongnized materials can often be used repeatedly, as long as they are not exposed to rapidly changing electric, magnetic or electro-magnetic fields. Application of (+) Qi Gong energy-stored paper or cloth, soft laser or changing electric field for 30-60 seconds on the area above the medulla oblongata, vertebral arteries or endocrine representation area at the tail of pancreas reduced or eliminated microcirculatory disturbances and enhanced drug uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The author succeeded in storing part of the Qi Gong energy in inanimate materials, such as papers, metals (such as a sheet of aluminum foil), glass, stone, band-aids, clothes, drugs, etc. in bi-polar (one end of the same material becomes (+) polarity and the other end of the same material becomes (-) polarity) form in one material or uni-polar, i.e., the entire material either has pure (+) polarity or (-) polarity. Water, EPA, vitamins, antibiotics and other drugs were also converted to (+) polarity. When the material has a bi-polar state, it becomes possible to eliminate one of the polarities by applying certain changing electrical fields. The effect of placing (+) polarity Qi Gong energy stored material was compared with direct application of the Qi Gong on pain, spastic muscle and spastic vertebral arteries. The therapeutic effects of these 2 methods were quite similar for the identical time duration but a more predictable effect was often obtained in the former. As our previous study indicates that acupuncture, electrical stimulation (1-3 pulses/sec.), as well as Qi Gong not only improved the microcirculatory disturbance and relaxed spastic muscles and vaso-constrictive arteries but also reduced or eliminated the pain and also selectively enhanced drug uptake to the area where drugs could not be delivered due to existing circulatory disturbances, by placing (+) Qi Gong stored material, such as a sheet of paper or aluminum foil, band-aid or clothes. Bi- Digital O-Ring Test evaluation indicated that not only did it produce all the beneficial effects of Qi Gong but also enhanced the drug uptake selectively in the area where it is necessary for the drug to be delivered for effective treatment, and reduced lead deposits in tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Qi-gong relaxation exercise was used for treatment of pregnancy induced hypertension(PIH). Patients exercised 3 times a day until labor. In this study, there were two groups with 60 cases of PIH who had delivered in each group, they were treated by Qi-gong for one group and by medicine for another used as control. The clinical efficacy was evaluated according to PIH combined scores showed effective for 54 cases (90.0%) in Qi-gong group and 33 cases (55.0%) for the control group (P less than 0.01). Meconium stain in amniotic fluid was present in 12 cases (20.0%) in Qi-gong group and 29 cases (48.3%) in the control group (P less than 0.05). The incidence of abnormal hematocrit (greater than 35%) before treatment was 52.4% and decreased to 23.8% (P less than 0.05) in Qi-gong, while in the control group was 35.7% before treatment and 45.2% after treatment (P greater than 0.05). The mean value of blood E2 by RIA showed increased from 22.97 +/- 13.16 micrograms/ml to 33.74 +/- 34.01 micrograms/ml after Qi-gong treatment in 29 cases. The microscopical observation of finger nail capillaries showed various degrees of improvement of microcirculation after Qi-gong exercise for 17 cases and after a course of Qi-gong treatment for 11 cases in Qi-gong group. While for the control group, there was no changes after sit-still for some time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Changes taking place in both Qi Gong Masters and their patients during Qi Gong treatment were evaluated using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test. During the Qi Gong state, on the Qi-Gong Master's body, as well as the body of the patient being treated, acupuncture points CV5 (Shi Men) and CV6 (Qi Hai)-- located below the umbilicus-- show changes from +4 in the pre-Qi Gong state to between -3 and -4 during the Qi Gong state. Before and after the Qi Gong, there is a normal +4 response to the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test at these acupuncture points. Similar changes were also observed on acupuncture points CV17 (Shan Zhong), CV 22 (Tian Tu), Yin Tang (at an area just between the eyebrows: the pituitary gland representation area, colloquially known as the \"third eye\") and GV20(Bai Hui), the entire pericardium meridian & triple burner meridian, their acupuncture points, the adrenal glands, testes, ovaries and perineum, as well as along the entire spinal vertebrae, particularly on and above the 12th thoracic vertebra, medulla oblongata, pons, and the intestinal representation areas of the brain located just above and behind the upper ear. Using these findings as criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of reaching the Qi Gong state, we were able to reproduce during the experimental trials similar changes in ourselves and the patient being treated with therapeutic effects comparable to those of the Qi Gong Master. Beneficial effects of external Qi Gong treatment given by a Qi Gong practitioner 1 to 3 times for 10-20 seconds each (although most Qi Gong masters take 3-20 minutes per treatment) often resulted in improvement of circulation and lowering of high blood pressure, as well as relaxation of spastic muscles, relief of pain, and enhanced general well-being, all of which resemble acupuncture effects. In order to reproduce the same procedure with others, we selected 4 children ranging between 8 and 11 years of age who had no knowledge of Qi Gong or Oriental medicine. One of these four children, the 8 year old, was able to consistently reach the same Qi Gong state after less than a half day and another child, 11, after less than 2 days. Within a week, the other two were sometimes able to reproduce the Qi Gong state but not always. Using the Qi Gong state thus obtained, it was found that this type of Qi Gong energy is directed to specific directions from the hand and can even penetrate wooden or metal doors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
