      "abstract": "Cannabis use in pregnancy is associated with low birthweight outcomes. Recent preclinical data suggests that maternal Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure leads to decreases in birthweight followed by early cardiac deficits in offspring. Currently, no studies have explored an intervention for these maternal THC-induced deficits. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to exhibit cardioprotective effects. In this present study, we demonstrated that maternal dietary supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids ameliorates both THC-induced fetal growth and postnatal cardiac deficits in offspring. Our data indicates this may be underpinned by alterations in cardiac and hepatic fatty acids and reduction in markers of cardiac collagen deposition. Interestingly, the cardioprotective effects of omega-3s may be further underscored by decreased signaling of the cardiac endocannabinoid system. With increasing rates of cannabis use in pregnancy and recent evidence of subsequent cardiometabolic aberrations in offspring, our data suggests a potential intervention for THC-induced fetal growth and cardiac disturbances in offspring.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many chemotherapy agents used to treat advanced cancer are inherently mucotoxic, causing breakdown of the gastrointestinal mucosa (gastrointestinal mucositis (GI-M)) and lead to a constellation of secondary complications including diarrhoea, malnutrition, anorexia, pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances. These symptoms are usually managed individually, leading to polypharmacy and its associated risks. The endocannabinoid system regulates numerous biological and behavioural processes associated with chemotherapy side effects, suggesting its modulation could control these symptoms. Therefore, the CANnabinoids in CANcer (CANCAN) therapy trial is a phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to determine the efficacy of medicinal cannabis in minimising GI-M and its associated symptom burden. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CANCAN trial is being conducted at four Australian sites: the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre and the Lyell McEwin Hospital. Adults (n=176) diagnosed with a solid tumour or a haematological cancer scheduled to receive mucotoxic chemotherapy will be eligible. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive either the investigational product (IP) or placebo, both delivered as sublingual wafers. The active IP contains cannabidiol (300 mg/day) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (5-20 mg/day, titrated by the participant). The primary outcome is GI-M burden, determined by the Mucositis Daily Questionnaire. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include overall symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale), anorexia (Average Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy), depression/anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), financial toxicity (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity), quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire), incidence of chemotherapy dose reductions/modifications, cumulative dose of chemotherapy administered, incidence/length of hospitalisation, the use of supportive care, and the cost-benefit of the IP. The CANCAN trial prioritises patient experiences by focusing on patient-reported outcome measures and administering medicinal cannabis during active treatment to prevent symptoms that occur secondary to mucositis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by Central Adelaide Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (2022HRE00037). All participants will be required to provide written or digitally authorised informed consent. Trial results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, and at scientific conferences.

      "abstract": "Emergency department visits due to cannabinoid-induced toxicity, including acute cannabinoid intoxication (ACI) have increased worldwide as more states have liberalized cannabis policy. ACI symptoms include anxiety, panic attacks, tachycardia, and psychosis, primarily mediated through cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) agonism by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the potential of CB1 receptor antagonist selonabant (ANEB-001) to block THC-induced effects in healthy adults. In Part A of the study, 10.5 mg of THC was coadministered with 50 mg (N = 20) or 100 mg (N = 20) selonabant, or matching placebo (N = 20). In Part B, 21-mg THC was coadministered with 30 mg (N = 9) or 10 mg (N = 7) selonabant, or matching placebo (N = 9). THC-related effects were assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS) for feeling high and alertness, objective measures of postural stability, and heart rate and analyzed using a mixed effects model. Selonabant significantly reduced VAS \"Feeling High\" (up to -82.8% (95% CI: -91.0%, -67.2%, P < 0.0001) at 30-mg selonabant) and increased VAS \"Alertness\" (up to 10.8 mm (95% CI: 4.7, 16.8 mm, P = 0.001) at 30-mg selonabant) vs. placebo. Selonabant 10 and 30 mg significantly reduced body sway (up to -30.6% (95% CI: -44.1%, -13.9%, P = 0.002) at 30 mg selonabant) vs. placebo. Effects on heart rate were not significant. Selonabant was generally safe and no clinically meaningful changes in mood occurred. Nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently at high selonabant doses; 10-mg selonabant was both well tolerated and efficacious. Present results support further development of selonabant for emergency treatment of ACI.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) represents a prevalent neurological complication affecting millions of patients globally. This clinical investigation evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of a novel transdermal medical cannabis formulation (THC:CBD:CBN) in treating painful DPN of the lower extremities. METHODS: This phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at Don Chan Hospital, Thailand, enrolling 100 participants over a 12-week intervention period. Using a computer-generated randomization sequence, participants were allocated to receive either the standardized cannabis formulation or a matched placebo. The primary outcome measure comprised pain intensity assessment using the validated Thai version of the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI-T). Secondary outcomes encompassed treatment-emergent adverse events and dermatological manifestations. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 28.0, incorporating generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The study protocol received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Khon Kaen University and the Kalasin Provincial Public Health Office Ethics Committee, with trial registration in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry. RESULTS: The intervention group demonstrated statistically significant reductions in NPSI-T scores across all measured dimensions (p < 0.001). Mean total NPSI-T scores decreased markedly from 25.60 to 5.57 in the treatment cohort, contrasting with minimal reduction from 25.24 to 22.85 in the placebo group. GEE analysis revealed significant pain amelioration at weeks 4, 8, and 12 (p < 0.001). The cannabis formulation exhibited an excellent safety profile, with only 10% of participants reporting mild adverse events, comparable to placebo group outcomes. CONCLUSION: This novel transdermal medical cannabis formulation (THC:CBD:CBN) demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating painful DPN symptoms while maintaining a favorable safety profile. These findings provide robust clinical evidence supporting its potential as an innovative therapeutic option for managing painful DPN."

Inflammation-induced up-regulation of microglial inflammatory markers was significantly attenuated by NTI-164, but not by CBD. NTI-164 promoted undifferentiated neuron proliferation and differentiated neuron survival under excitotoxic conditions. These effects suggest the potential for NTI-164 as a treatment for neuropathologies.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol and cannabis are often taken in combination, and extensive co-use has been linked to enduring changes in cognitive and metabolic functioning. The underlying mechanisms for these effects are unclear, but we recently demonstrated that co-administration of ethanol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) to adolescent rats caused lasting adaptations in GABA and glycogen synthase kinase 3ß (GSK3ß) signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). As a ubiquitous protein kinase, GSK3ß is downstream to the protein kinase B (also known as AKT) pathway that is activated by insulin receptor signaling in a main control center for metabolism and energy homeostasis, the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). Our goal here was to investigate if volitional co-use of low to moderate levels of ethanol and THC would impact the total and phosphorylated levels (p) of AKT and GSK3ß in the mPFC and MBH. Peri-adolescent Long Evans rats [postnatal day (P) 30-47] consumed 10 % ethanol, cookies laced with THC (3-10 mg/kg/day), both drugs, or vehicle controls. On P114, we modeled re-exposure to a behaviorally relevant dose of THC by challenging rats (i.p.) with 5 mg/kg THC (or vehicle) and sacrificed them 30 min later. Western blot analysis revealed that THC challenge increased pAKT and pGSK3ß compared to control similarly across all treatment groups, sexes, and brain regions; no effects on total levels of AKT or GSK3ß were found. Previously reported behavioral results from these rats showed no differences in working memory assessed in adulthood. Although future studies will be necessary to determine the role of exposure dose on drug-induced adaptations in AKT and GSK3ß signaling, the current findings suggest that moderate volitional co-use of alcohol and THC may not produce long-term deficits that persist into adulthood.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of high-potency cannabis products is associated with an increased risk of mental disorders. This study investigates whether the rising THC concentration in Germany is associated with an increase in cannabis-related diagnoses. METHODS: The number of insured persons with at least one cannabis-related ICD-10 F12 diagnosis (e.g., harmful use, dependence) in outpatient care was provided by statutory health insurance funds between 2009 and 2021. The dependent variable is the ratio of (a) the number of insured persons with at least one F12 diagnosis to (b) all insured persons who have used cannabis in the last year. Information on THC concentration in cannabis flower was provided by law enforcement agencies. Using generalised mixed linear models, the dependent variable was predicted by the median THC concentration in cannabis flower. RESULTS: The regression results show that an increase in THC concentration by one percentage point is significantly associated with an increase in the proportion of diagnoses (women: +0.17; men: +0.42). THC concentration positively predicted the proportion of diagnoses in all 16 federal states for men and in 15 federal states for women. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared to low-potency products, using high-potency products may pose additional health risks, which may be particularly pronounced in men. Acknowledging the limitations of the ecological study design and uncertainties inherent to the analysed data, further investigations on the sex-specific impact of THC exposure are required. Limiting the THC concentration in cannabis products and closely monitoring THC consumption in the population appears necessary.",

      "abstract": "Humans use cannabinoid drugs to alleviate pain. As cannabis and cannabinoids are legalized in the United States for medicinal and recreational use, it has become critical to determine the potential utilities and harms of cannabinoid drugs in individuals living with chronic pain. Here, we tested the effects of repeated ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) vapor inhalation on thermal nociception and mechanical sensitivity, in adult male and female Wistar rats using a chronic inflammatory pain model (ie, treated with complete Freund's adjuvant [CFA]). We report that repeated THC vapor inhalation rescues thermal hyperalgesia in males and females treated with CFA and also reduces mechanical hypersensitivity in CFA males but not females. Many of the antihyperalgesic effects of chronic THC vapor were still observable 24 hours after cessation of the last THC exposure. We also report plasma levels of THC and its major metabolites, some of which are cannabinoid type-1 receptor agonists, after the first and tenth days of THC vapor inhalation. Finally, we report that systemic administration of the cannabinoid type-1 receptor inverse agonist AM251 (1 mg/kg, I.P.) blocks the antihyperalgesic effects of THC vapor in males and females. These data provide a foundation for future work that will explore the cells and circuits underlying the antihyperalgesic effects of THC vapor inhalation in individuals with chronic inflammatory pain. PERSPECTIVE: Cannabinoids are thought to have potential utility in the treatment of chronic pain, but few animal studies have tested the effects of chronic THC or cannabis in animal models of chronic pain. We tested the effects of repeated THC vapor inhalation on chronic pain-related outcomes in male and female animals.",

      "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a major role in the maintenance of bodily homeostasis and adaptive response to external insults. It has been shown to regulate crucial physiological processes and behaviors, spanning nervous functions, anxiety, cognition, and pain sensation. Due to this broad activity, the ECS has been explored as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of select diseases. However, until there is a more comprehensive understanding of how ECS activation by exogenous and endogenous ligands manifests across disparate tissues and cells, discretion should be exercised. Previous work has investigated how endogenous cannabinoid signaling impacts skeletal muscle development and differentiation. However, the effects of activation of the ECS by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the most psychoactive component of cannabis) on skeletal muscle development, particularly in utero, remain unclear. To address this research gap, we used a highly translational non-human primate model to examine the potential impact of chronic prenatal THC exposure on fetal and infant musculoskeletal development. RNA was isolated from the skeletal muscle and analyzed for differential gene expression using a Nanostring nCounter neuroinflammatory panel comprised of 770 genes. Histomorphological evaluation of muscle morphology and composition was also performed. Our findings suggest that while prenatal THC exposure had narrow overall effects on fetal and infant muscle development, the greatest impacts were observed within pathways related to inflammation and cytokine signaling, which suggest the potential for tissue damage and atrophy. This pilot study establishes feasibility to evaluate neuroinflammation due to prenatal THC exposure and provides rationale for follow-on studies that explore the longer-term implications and functional consequences encountered by offspring as they continue to mature.",

Unfortunately, tumours often develop resistance to cisplatin, forcing scientists to look for alternatives or synergistic combinations with other drugs. In this work, we attempted to find a potential synergistic effect between cisplatin and cannabinoid delta-9-THC, as well as the high-THC Cannabis sativa extract, for the treatment of HT-29, HCT-116, and LS-174T colorectal cancer cell lines.

To elucidate the mechanisms of drug interactions and the distinct impacts of individual treatments, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of affected pathways within the colorectal cancer cell line HT-29. Our primary objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with each treatment modality and their potential interactions. Our findings revealed an antagonistic interaction between cisplatin and high-THC cannabis extract, which could be linked to alterations in gene transcription associated with cell death (BCL2, BAD, caspase 10), DNA repair pathways (Rad52), and cancer pathways related to drug resistance.",

      "abstract": "The Cannabis sativa plant has been used for centuries as a recreational drug and more recently in the treatment of patients with neurological or psychiatric disorders. In many instances, treatment goals include relief from posttraumatic disorders, anxiety, or to support treatment of chronic pain. Ligands acting on cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) are also potential targets for the treatment of other health conditions. Using an evidence-based approach, pharmacological investigation of CB1R agonists is timely, with the aim to provide chronically ill patients relief using well-defined and characterized compounds from cannabis. Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC), currently available over the counter in many countries to adults and even children, is of great interests to policy makers, legal administrators, and healthcare regulators, as well as pharmacologists. Herein, we studied the pharmacodynamics of HHC epimers, which activate CB1R. We compared their key CB1R-mediated signaling pathway activities and compared them to the pathways activated by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). We provide evidence that activation of CB1R by HHC ligands is only broadly comparable to those mediated by Δ9-THC, and that both HHC epimers have unique properties. Together with the greater chemical stability of HHC compared to Δ9-THC, these molecules have a potential to become a part of modern medicine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Disordered autonomic nervous system regulation and supraspinal pain inhibition have been repeatedly described in chronic pain. We aimed to explore the effects of δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), an emerging treatment option, on autonomic nervous system and central pain modulation measures in patients with chronic pain. METHODS: Twelve male patients with chronic radicular neuropathic pain participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled, single-administration trial. Low/high frequency (LF/HF) heart rate variability (HRV) ratio and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) response were measured and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at baseline and after sublingual administration of either 0.2 mg/kg oral THC or placebo. RESULTS: THC significantly reduced the LF/HF ratio compared with placebo (interaction effect F(1,11) = 20.5; p < 0.005) and significantly improved CPM responses (interaction effect F(1,9) = 5.2; p = 0.048). The THC-induced reduction in LF/HF ratio correlated with increased functional connectivity between the rostral ventrolateral medulla and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [T(10) = 6.4, cluster p-FDR < 0.005]. CONCLUSIONS: THC shifts the autonomic balance towards increased parasympathetic tone and improves inhibitory pain mechanisms in chronic pain. The increase in vagal tone correlates with connectivity changes in higher-order regulatory brain regions, suggesting THC exerts top-down effects. These changes may reflect a normalizing effect of THC on multiple domains of supraspinal pain dysregulation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: NCT02560545.",

Recent clinical trials are suggestive of the diverse pharmacologic potentials for THC but suffer from small sample sizes, short study duration, failure to address tolerance, little dose variation, ill-defined outcome measures, and failure to identify and/or evaluate confounds, all of which may constitute significant threats to the validity of most trials. However, the existing work underscores the potential therapeutic value of THC and, at the same time, calls attention to the critical need for better-designed protocols to fully explore and demonstrate safety and efficacy. In the most general sense, the present brief review illuminates some intriguing findings about THC, along with the basic threats to the validity of the research that supports those findings. The intent is to highlight existing generic weaknesses in the existing randomized controlled trial literature and, most importantly, provide guidance for improved clinical research."

      "abstract": "Global cannabis use has risen 23% since 2010, with 209 million reported users, most of whom are males of reproductive age. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive phytocannabinoid in cannabis, disrupts pro-homeostatic functions of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) within the male reproductive system. The ECS is highly involved in regulating morpho-functional and intrinsic sperm features that are required for fertilization and pre-implantation embryo development. Previous work by our group demonstrated that THC altered sperm capacitation and the transcriptome, including several fertility-associated microRNAs (miRs). Despite the prevalent use of cannabis among males of reproductive age, clinical and pre-clinical research investigating the impact of paternal cannabis on sperm function and the outcomes of artificial reproductive technologies (ARTs) remains inconclusive. Therefore, the present study investigates the impact of in vitro THC exposure on morpho-functional and intrinsic sperm functions, including contributions to embryo development following IVF. Bovine sperm were used as a translational model for human and treated with concentrations of THC that reflect plasma levels after therapeutic (0.032μM), and low (0.32μM)-high (4.8μM) recreational cannabis use. After 6-hours of treatment, THC did not alter the acrosomal reaction, but 4.8μM significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (p<0.05), primarily through agonistic interactions with CB-receptors. Fertilization of bovine oocytes with THC-treated sperm did not alter developmental rates, but blastocysts generated from sperm treated with 0.32-4.8μM THC had fewer trophoblasts (p<0.05), while blastocysts generated from sperm exposed to any concentration of THC had fewer cells in the inner cell mass (ICM), particularly within the 0.032μM group (p<0.001). Fertility associated miRs, including miR-346, miR-324, miR-33b, and miR-34c were analyzed in THC-exposed sperm and associated blastocysts generated by IVF, with lower levels of miRs-346, -324, and -33b found in sperm treated with 0.32μM THC, while miR-34c levels were higher in sperm treated with 0.032μM THC (p<0.05). Levels of miR-346 were also lower in sperm treated with 0.032μM THC, but higher in blastocysts generated from sperm exposed to 0.32μM THC (p<0.05). Our findings suggest that THC may alter key morpho-functional and epigenetic sperm factors involved in fertilization and embryo development. This is the first study to demonstrate that sperm exposed to THC in vitro negatively affects embryo quality following IVF.",

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids have shown potential in drug-resistant epilepsy treatment; however, we lack knowledge on which cannabinoid(s) to use, dosing, and their pharmacological targets. This study investigated (i) the anticonvulsant effect of Cannabidiol (CBD) alone and (ii) in combination with Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), as well as (iii) the serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor's role in CBD's mechanism of action. Seizure activity, induced by 4-aminopyridine, was measured by extracellular field recordings in cortex layer 2/3 of mouse brain slices. The anticonvulsant effect of 10, 30, and 100 µM CBD alone and combined with Δ9-THC was evaluated. To examine CBD's mechanism of action, slices were pre-treated with a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist before CBD's effect was evaluated. An amount of ≥30 µM CBD alone exerted significant anticonvulsant effects while 10 µM CBD did not. However, 10 µM CBD combined with low-dose Δ9-THC (20:3 ratio) displayed significantly greater anticonvulsant effects than either phytocannabinoid alone. Furthermore, blocking 5-HT1A receptors before CBD application significantly abolished CBD's effects. Thus, our results demonstrate the efficacy of low-dose CBD and Δ9-THC combined and that CBD exerts its effects, at least in part, through 5-HT1A receptors. These results could address drug-resistance while providing insight into CBD's mechanism of action, laying the groundwork for further testing of cannabinoids as anticonvulsants.",

This study examines the effects of oral consumption of whole Cannabis and a complex Cannabis extract on neurochemicals, endocannabinoids (eCB), and physiological parameters (body temperature, heart rate) in mice. METHODS: In this pilot study, C57BL/6 J mice were treated with one of the following every other day for 2 weeks: a complex Cannabis extract by gavage, whole Cannabis mixed with nutritional gel through free feeding, or purified THC/CBD by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Treatments were conducted at 4 doses ranging from 0-100 mg/kg/day of CBD with THC levels of ≤ 1.2 mg/kg/day for free feeding and gavage and 10 mg/kg/day for i.p. Body temperature and heart rate were monitored using surgically implanted telemetry devices. Levels of neurochemicals, eCB, THC, CBD, and 11-OH-THC were measured using mass spectrometry 48 h after the final treatment. Statistical comparisons were conducted using ANOVA and t-tests. RESULTS: Differences were found between neurochemicals in the brains and plasma of mice treated by i.p. (e.g. dopamine, p < 0.01), gavage (e.g., phenylalanine, p < 0.05) and in mice receiving whole Cannabis (e.g., 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic DOPAC p < 0.05). Tryptophan trended downward or was significantly decreased in the brain and/or plasma of all mice receiving Cannabis or purified CBD/THC, regardless of dose, compared to controls. Levels of the eCB, arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) were decreased in mice receiving lowest doses of a complex Cannabis extract by gavage, but were higher in mice receiving highest doses compared to controls (p < 0.05). Plasma and brain levels of THC and 11-OH-THC were higher in mice receiving 1:1 THC:CBD by i.p. compared to those receiving 1:5 or 1:10 THC:CBD. Nominal changes in body temperature and heart rate following acute and repeated exposures were seen to some degree in all treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Changes to neurochemicals and eCBs were apparent at all doses regardless of treatment type. Levels of neurochemicals seemed to vary based on the presence of a complex Cannabis extract, suggesting a non-linear response between THC and neurochemicals following repeated oral dosing."

However, the performance of POCT devices with oral medicinal cannabis products remains poorly described. In a randomised, double-blinded, crossover trial, adults with insomnia disorder (n = 20) received a single (2 mL) oral dose of oil containing 10 mg THC + 200 mg cannabidiol, or placebo, prior to sleep. Participants were tested with the Securetec DrugWipe® 5S (10 ng/mL THC cut-off) and Dräger DrugTest® 5000 (25 ng/mL THC cut-off) POCT devices at baseline (pre-treatment) and then at 0.5, 10, and 18 h post-treatment. An OF sample, taken at each time point, was also analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Large individual variability in OF THC concentrations was observed 0.5 h post-treatment (range: 0-425 ng/mL; mean (SD) 48.7 (107.5) ng/mL). Both the Securetec DrugWipe® 5S and DrugTest® 5000 demonstrated poor sensitivity to THC at 0.5 h post-treatment (25% and 50%, respectively). At 10 and 18 h post-treatment, all participant OF THC concentrations were below screening cut-offs, and all test results were negative. These findings highlight the relatively poor sensitivity of both devices in detecting recent use of an oral medicinal cannabis product. They also suggest a low probability of obtaining a positive THC result the morning after ('one-off') use. Further research is required to establish the probability of obtaining a positive THC result with regular medicinal cannabis use.",

      "abstract": "Indoor-grown Cannabis sativa is commonly transitioned to a 12 h daily photoperiod to promote flowering. However, our previous research has shown that some indoor-grown cannabis cultivars can initiate strong flowering responses under daily photoperiods longer than 12 h. Since longer photoperiods inherently provide higher daily light integrals (DLIs), they may also increase growth and yield. To test this hypothesis, two THC-dominant cannabis cultivars, 'Incredible Milk' (IM) and 'Gorilla Glue' (GG), were grown to commercial maturity at a canopy level PPFD of 540 µmol·m-2·s-1 from white LEDS under 12 h or 13 h daily photoperiods, resulting in DLIs of 23.8 and 25.7 mol·m-2·d-1, respectively. Both treatments were harvested when the plants in the 12 h treatment reached maturity according to established commercial protocols. There was no delay in flowering initiation time in GG, but flowering initiation in IM was delayed by about 1.5 d under 13 h. Stigma browning and trichome ambering also occurred earlier and progressed faster in the 12 h treatment in both cultivars. The vegetative growth of IM plants in the 13 h treatment was greater and more robust. The inflorescence yields were strikingly higher in the 13 h vs. 12 h treatment, i.e., 1.35 times and 1.50 times higher in IM and GG, respectively, which is 4 to 6 times higher than the relative increase in DLIs. The inflorescence concentrations of major cannabinoids in the 13 h treatment were either higher or not different from the 12 h treatment in both cultivars. These results suggest that there may be substantial commercial benefits for using photoperiods longer than 12 h for increasing inflorescence yields without decreasing cannabinoid concentrations in some cannabis cultivars grown in indoor environments."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Preclinical studies have found that chronic ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) treatment is directly associated with weight gain when introduced during adolescence and adulthood, but the effect of prenatal THC is unclear. Clinical studies have demonstrated prenatal exposure to THC is a prospective predictor of increased health risks associated with obesity. Our study aims to examine prenatal THC impact on obesity risks in males and females throughout adolescence using a clinically relevant inhalation model. METHODS: Pregnant rats were exposed to one of the following from gestational day 2 through birth: 10 mg THC, 40 mg THC, or air. Daily 10-min inhalations were conducted in each animal from 0900 to 1200. Offspring from each treatment group were given either a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal diet (ND). Food and bodyweights were collected daily, while circadian activity, locomotion, and exercise were measured periodically (PND 21-60). Pregnancy weight gain and birth weight were collected to determine early-life developmental effects. RESULTS: Rats prenatally treated with low-dose THC (LDTHC) generally had lower dark-cycle activity compared with control counterparts, but this altered activity was not observed at the higher dose of THC (HDTHC). In terms of open-field activity, THC doses displayed a general increase in locomotion. In addition, the LDTHC male rats in the ND showed significantly greater exploratory behavior. Prenatal THC had dose-dependent effects on maternal weight gain and birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings indicate there are some activity-related and developmental effects of prenatal THC, which may be related to obesity risks later in life.",

      "abstract": "Adolescent exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has enduring effects on energy metabolism and immune function. Prior work showed that daily administration of a low-impact dose of THC (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) during adolescence alters transcription in adult microglia and disrupts their response to bacterial endotoxin or social stress. To explore the lasting impact of adolescent THC exposure on the brain's reaction to viral infection, we administered THC (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) in male and female mice once daily on postnatal day (PND) 30-43. When the mice reached adulthood (PND 70), we challenged them with the viral mimic, polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)], and assessed sickness behavior (motor activity, body temperature) and whole brain gene transcription. Poly(I:C) caused an elevation in body temperature which was lessened by prior THC exposure in female but not male mice. Adolescent THC exposure did not affect the locomotor response to Poly(I:C) in either sex. Transcriptomic analyses showed that Poly(I:C) produced a substantial upregulation of immune-related genes in the brain, which was decreased by THC in females. Additionally, the viral mimic caused a male-selective downregulation in transcription of genes involved in neurodevelopment and synaptic transmission, which was abrogated by adolescent THC treatment. The results indicate that Poly(I:C) produces complex transcriptional alterations in the mouse brain, which are sexually dimorphic and differentially affected by early-life THC exposure. In particular, adolescent THC dampens the brain's antiviral response to Poly(I:C) in female mice and prevents the transcriptional downregulation of neuron-related genes caused by the viral mimic in male mice.",

      "abstract": "Δ8-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) is increasingly popular as a controversial substitute for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in cannabinoid-infused edibles. Δ8-THC is prepared from cannabidiol (CBD) by treatment with acids. Side products including Δ9-THC and other isomers that might end up in Δ8-THC edibles are less studied. In this paper, three orthogonal methods, namely reversed-phase (RP)-UHPLC-DAD/HRMS, normal-phase/argentation (silica-Ag(I))-HPLC-DAD/MS, and GC-FID/MS were developed for analysis of cannabinoid isomers, namely Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC, CBD, Δ8-iso-THC, Δ(4)8-iso-THC, and hydrated THC isomers. Eight acid-treated CBD mixtures contained various amounts of Δ8-THC (0-89%, w/w%), high levels of Δ9-THC (up to 49%), Δ8-isoTHC (up to 55%), Δ(4)8-iso-THC (up to 17%), and three hydrated THC isomers. Commercial Δ8-THC gummies were also analyzed, and issues like overclaimed Δ8-THC, excessive Δ9-THC, undeclared Δ8-iso-THC, and Δ(4)8-iso-THC were found. These findings highlight the urgency of improving regulations towards converting CBD to Δ8-THC for use as food ingredients.",

      "abstract": "GPR55 is involved in many physiological and pathological processes. In cancer, GPR55 has been described to show accelerating and decelerating effects in tumor progression resulting from distinct intracellular signaling pathways. GPR55 becomes activated by LPI and various plant-derived, endogenous, and synthetic cannabinoids. Cannabinoids such as THC exerted antitumor effects by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation or inducing apoptosis. Besides its effects through CB1 and CB2 receptors, THC modulates cellular responses among others via GPR55. Previously, we reported a reduction in Ki67-immunoreactive nuclei of human glioblastoma cells after GPR55 activation in general by THC and in particular by LPI. In the present study, we investigated intracellular mechanisms leading to an altered number of Ki67+ nuclei after stimulation of GPR55 by LPI and THC. Pharmacological analyses revealed a strongly involved PLC-IP3 signaling and cell-type-specific differences in Gα-, Gβγ-, RhoA-ROCK, and calcineurin signaling. Furthermore, immunochemical visualization of the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor NFAT revealed an unchanged subcellular localization after THC or LPI treatment. The data underline the cell-type-specific diversity of GPR55-associated signaling pathways in coupling to intracellular G proteins. Furthermore, this diversity might determine the outcome and the individual responsiveness of tumor cells to GPR55 stimulation by cannabin oids.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis has been used historically for both medicinal and recreational purposes, with the most notable cannabinoids being cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Although their therapeutic effects have been well studied and their recreational use is highly debated, the underlying mechanisms of their biological effects remain poorly defined. In this study, we use isobaric tag-based sample multiplexed proteome profiling to investigate protein abundance differences in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line treated with CBD and THC. We identified significantly regulated proteins by each treatment and performed a pathway classification and associated protein-protein interaction analysis. Our findings suggest that these treatments may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and induce endoplasmic reticulum stress. These data can potentially be interrogated further to investigate the potential role of CBD and THC in various biological and disease contexts, providing a foundation for future studies."

      "abstract": "Precise crop fertilization requires an in-depth understanding of plant uptake and utilisation to optimise sustainable production. This study investigated the influence of nitrogen (N) nutrition and pruning on the cannabinoid concentrations and biomass of a commercial cannabis cultivar; the rationale for this study is how N supply and pruning affect cannabinoid yields and concentration in a commercial setting. Clones of a Cannabis sativa L. (CBD-type) were grown in a controlled-environment glasshouse in pots with coarse sand. After five weeks of vegetative growth under 210 mg/L N and an 18 h light regime, rates of 30, 60, 210, and 500 mg/L N were applied to plants for twelve weeks and a light regime set at 12 h. Double stem pruning was applied as an additional treatment to investigate efficacy on biomass increase. Biomass, N concentrations, and cannabinoid concentrations were measured after the final harvest. Pruning treatment did not increase cannabinoid concentrations or affect biomass. It was coincidentally found that plants on the glasshouse edge with higher exposure to sunlight developed more biomass and higher cannabinoid concentrations. Only biomass in leaves was increased significantly via higher nitrogen nutrition. Cannabinoid concentration, as well as cannabinoid yield per plant were decreased with the increase in N supply. High rates of fertilizer are not recommended because of reduced cannabinoid concentration and biomass yield: the ideal N supply is likely to be between 60 and 210 mg/L. This research will benefit growers and advisors in understanding the complexity of effects of nitrogen fertiliser and pruning practices on plant biomass and secondary metabolite production in medicinal cannabis.",

      "abstract": "Clinical treatment with the antineoplastic drug irinotecan (IRI) is often hindered by side effects that significantly reduce the quality of life of treated patients. Due to the growing public support for products with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), even though relevant scientific literature does not provide clear evidence of their high antitumour potential, some cancer patients take unregistered preparations containing up to 80 % THC. This study was conducted on a syngeneic colorectal cancer mouse model to test the efficiency and safety of concomitant treatment with IRI and THC. Male BALB/c mice subcutaneously injected with CT26 cells were receiving 60 mg/kg of IRI intraperitoneally on day 1 and 5 of treatment and/or 7 mg/kg of THC by gavage a day for 7 days. Treatment responses were evaluated based on changes in body, brain, and liver weight, tumour growth, blood cholinesterase activity, and oxidative stress parameters. Irinotecan's systemic toxicity was evidenced by weight loss and high oxidative stress. The important finding of this study is that combining THC with IRI diminishes IRI efficiency in inhibiting tumour growth. However, further studies, focused on more subtle molecular methods in tumour tissue and analytical analysis of IRI and THC distribution in tumour-bearing mice, are needed to prove our observations.",

      "abstract": "Neuronal cell death is a physiological process that, when uncontrollable, leads to neurodegenerative disorders like spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI represents one of the major causes of trauma and disabilities worldwide for which no effective pharmacological intervention exists. Herein, we observed the beneficial effects of Δ8-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) during neuronal cell death recovery. We cultured NSC-34 motoneuron cell line performing three different experiments. A traumatic scratch injury was caused in two experiments. One of the scratched was pretreated with Δ8-THC to observe the role of the cannabinoid following the trauma. An experimental control group was neither scratched nor pretreated. All the experiments underwent RNA-seq analysis. The effects of traumatic injury were observed in scratch against control comparison. Comparison of scratch models with or without pretreatment highlighted how Δ8-THC counteracts the traumatic event. Our results shown that Δ8-THC triggers the cytoskeletal remodeling probably due to the activation of the Janus Kinase Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway and the signaling cascade operated by the Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase signaling pathway. In light of this evidence, Δ8-THC could be a valid pharmacological approach in the treatment of abnormal neuronal cell death occurring in motoneuron cells."

In rodent models, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) from the plant Cannabis sativa L. have shown anti-obesity properties, suggesting a link between the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and obesity. However, the oral administration route has rarely been studied in this context. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of prolonged oral administration of pure THC and CBD on obesity-related parameters and peripheral endocannabinoids. C57BL/6 male mice were fed with either a high-fat or standard diet and then received oral treatment in ramping doses, namely 10 mg/kg of THC or CBD for 5 weeks followed by 30 mg/kg for an additional 5 weeks. Mice treated with THC had attenuated weight gain and improved glucose tolerance, followed by improvement in steatosis markers and decreased hypertrophic cells in adipose epididymal tissue. Mice treated with CBD had improved glucose tolerance and increased markers of lipid metabolism in adipose and liver tissues, but in contrast to THC, CBD had no effect on weight gain and steatosis markers. CBD exclusively decreased the level of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol in the liver. These data suggest that the prolonged oral consumption of THC, but not of CBD, ameliorates diet-induced obesity and metabolic parameters, possibly through a mechanism of adipose tissue adaptation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The co-use of nicotine and cannabis has been steadily rising in the United States. Rodent studies suggest that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) could increase addictive qualities of nicotine, but whether repeated THC exposure alters self-administration of nicotine has not been tested. We hypothesized that THC would increase the reinforcing effects of nicotine and alter nicotine intake. METHODS: Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with THC (0, 3, 30 mg/kg) daily for 14 days prior to and during training for intravenous self-administration of nicotine. Rats were allowed to self-administer nicotine for several weeks, then tested for sensitivity to nicotine dose through multiple determinations of a nicotine dose-effect curve with or without THC pretreatment. A separate set of rats were trained on fixed ratio responding for sucrose and assessed for THC effects on behavior. RESULTS: Post-session THC decreased nicotine self-administration in male and female rats throughout acquisition and maintenance and increased the latency to stable rates of nicotine intake during acquisition. Post-session THC shifted nicotine dose-effect curves downward, and pre-session THC suppressed responding at higher nicotine doses. Unlike nicotine, responding for sucrose was not affected by post-session THC. Pre-session THC decreased responding for sucrose, particularly for THC-naïve rats. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated post-session THC decreased nicotine-taking behaviors but did not alter sucrose responding. Thus, post-session THC may alter sensitivity to nicotine. Pre-session THC treatment decreased lever pressing in both sucrose and nicotine studies, indicating this effect was nonspecific. These studies show that THC modulates patterns of nicotine intake in rat models.",

Regular cannabis consumption typically begins during adolescence, and this early cannabinoid exposure may increase the risk for drug addiction in adulthood. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the development of cannabis addiction-like behavior in adult mice after adolescent exposure to the main psychoactive component of cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). METHODS: Adolescent male mice were exposed to 5 mg/kg of THC from postnatal days 37 to 57. Operant self-administration sessions of WIN 55,212-2 (12.5 μg/kg/infusion) were conducted for 10 days. Mice were tested for three addiction-like criteria (persistence of response, motivation, and compulsivity), two parameters related to craving (resistance to extinction and drug-seeking behavior), and two phenotypic vulnerability traits related to substance use disorders (impulsivity and reward sensitivity). Additionally, qPCR assays were performed to detect differentially expressed genes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum, and hippocampus (HPC) of \"addicted\" and \"non-addicted\" mice. RESULTS: Adolescent THC exposure did not modify WIN 55,212-2 reinforcement nor the development of cannabis addiction-like behavior. Inversely, THC pre-exposed mice displayed impulsive-like behavior in adulthood, which was more pronounced in mice that developed the addiction-like criteria. Moreover, downregulated drd2 and adora2a gene expression in NAc and HPC was revealed in THC pre-exposed mice, as well as a downregulation of drd2 expression in mPFC of vehicle pre-treated mice that developed addiction-like behaviors. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that adolescent THC exposure may promote impulsivity-like behavior in adulthood, associated with downregulated drd2 and adora2a expression in NAc and HPC."

To date, there have been a number of qualitatively different studies on the effectiveness of MC in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of THC in the course of interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMPT) on pain and several psychometric variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the study, in the period 2017-2018, all patients in the pain ward of a clinic who were suffering from FMS and were treated in a multimodal interdisciplinary setting were selected based on inclusion criteria. The patients were examined separately according to groups with and without THC about pain intensity, various psychometric parameters and analgesic consumption during the stay. RESULTS: Of the 120 FMS patients included in the study, 62 patients (51.7%) were treated with THC. In the parameters of pain intensity, depression, and quality of life, there was a significant improvement in the entire group during the stay (p < 0.001), which was significantly greater through the use of THC. In five of the seven analgesic groups examined, the dose was reduced or the drug discontinued significantly more often in the patients treated with THC. CONCLUSION: The results provide indications that THC can be considered as a medical alternative in addition to the substances previously recommended in various guidelines.",

METHODS: This case series assessed adverse events reported by delta-8-THC users on the Reddit forum r/Delta8 and compared these to delta-8-THC AEs in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Delta-8-THC and cannabis AEs reported in FAERS were also compared. The r/Delta8 forum was selected because it includes a large sample of 98,700 registered individuals who publicly discuss their experiences using delta-8-THC. All r/Delta8 posts were obtained from August 20, 2020, through September 25, 2022. A random sample of r/Delta8 posts was drawn (n = 10,000) and filtered for posts in which delta-8-THC users reported an adverse event (n = 335). FAERS reports that listed delta-8-THC (N = 326) or cannabis (N = 7076) as a suspect product active ingredient were obtained. Adverse events claimed to result from delta-8-THC use were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities to system organ class and preferred term categories. RESULTS: The absolute number of delta-8-THC adverse event reports (N = 2184, 95% CI = 1949-2426) and serious adverse event reports (N = 437; 95% CI = 339-541) on r/Delta 8 were higher than the adverse event reports (N = 326) and serious adverse event reports (N = 289) to FAERS. Psychiatric disorders were the most frequently cited system organ class in r/Delta8 adverse event reports, mentioned in 41.2% (95% CI = 35.8%-46.3%) of reports, followed by respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (29.3%, 95% CI = 25.1%-34.0%) and nervous system disorders (23.3%, 95% CI = 18.5%-27.5%). Anxiety (16.4%, 95% CI = 12.8-20.6), Cough (15.5%, 95% CI = 11.9-20.0) and Paranoia (9.3%, 95% CI = 6.3-12.5) were the most frequently cited preferred terms in adverse event reports. The overall prevalence of AEs reported for cannabis and delta-8-THC on FAERS were also similar when analyzed by system organ class (Pearson's r = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this case series suggest that most of the adverse events reported by delta-8-THC users are like those reported during acute cannabis intoxication. This finding suggests that health care professionals follow similar treatment and management protocols, and that jurisdictions should clarify whether delta-8-THC can be sold as a hemp product."

No specific pharmacological treatment for PTSD-related nightmares is yet approved. Preliminary clinical data indicate that cannabinoid agonists can improve nightmares and overall PTSD symptoms in patients with PTSD. The primary objective of the study is to examine the efficacy of oral dronabinol (BX-1) versus placebo in reducing nightmares in patients with PTSD. The secondary objectives of the study are to examine the efficacy of oral BX-1 in reducing other PTSD symptoms. METHODS: The study is designed as a multi-centric, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, parallel group interventional trial. Eligible patients will be randomized to BX-1 or placebo, receiving a once-daily oral dose before bedtime for 10 weeks. Primary efficacy endpoint is the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) B2 score for the last week, measuring frequency and intensity of nightmares. Secondary efficacy endpoints are other disorder-specific symptoms in patients with PTSD. Further, tolerability and safety of dronabinol will be assessed. DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled trial will provide evidence whether treating patients with PTSD and nightmares with dronabinol is safe and efficacious.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: While an increased risk of developing germ cell tumors has been established in regular cannabis consumers, there is conflicting evidence about an association between cannabis use and testosterone levels in those regular consumers. In this context, we aimed to determine whether Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the two major and best-studied cannabinoids present in cannabis, also the most used for therapeutic applications, can directly impact the steroidogenic function and germ cell lineage of the human adult testis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used our well-characterized organotypic culture of human testis, in which adult testis explants were exposed to CBD, THC, or CBD/THC [ratio 1:1] from 10-9 to 10-5 M for up to either 48 hours or 9 days of culture. The testes were obtained from multi-organ donors (n=13; mean age: 55.15±5.62 y). RESULTS: The testosterone production and the spatial distribution of Leydig cells did not change upon CBD and/or THC exposure versus controls after 48 hours or 9 days. The overall tissue morphology of the cannabinoids-exposed testis explants was similar to their control upon 24 hours or 9 days of exposure, a finding confirmed by morphometric analyses on short-term cultures. In line, the number of apoptotic cells was not affected by either 48 hours or 9 days of cannabinoids treatment versus mock. Cannabinoids had no impact on the number of proliferating cells nor on mRNA expression of genes encoding proteins involved in germ cell differentiation, meiosis, or Sertoli and Leydig functions after 24 hours exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these findings show an absence of acute direct effects of exposure to cannabis-derived cannabinoids THC and CBD on testicular testosterone production and germ cells ex vivo. Further studies are warranted to explore an indirect impact of cannabinoids on testis functions through the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis, as well as the potential effects of long-term exposures."

      "abstract": "The cannabis plant exerts its pharmaceutical activity primarily by the binding of cannabinoids to two G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. The role that cannabis terpenes play in this activation has been considered and debated repeatedly, based on only limited experimental results. In the current study we used a controlled in-vitro heterologous expression system to quantify the activation of CB1 receptors by sixteen cannabis terpenes individually, by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alone and by THC-terpenes mixtures. The results demonstrate that all terpenes, when tested individually, activate CB1 receptors, at about 10-50% of the activation by THC alone. The combination of some of these terpenes with THC significantly increases the activity of the CB1 receptor, compared to THC alone. In some cases, several fold. Importantly, this amplification is evident at terpene to THC ratios similar to those in the cannabis plant, which reflect very low terpene concentrations. For some terpenes, the activation obtained by THC- terpene mixtures is notably greater than the sum of the activations by the individual components, suggesting a synergistic effect. Our results strongly support a modulatory effect of some of the terpenes on the interaction between THC and the CB1 receptor. As the most effective terpenes are not necessarily the most abundant ones in the cannabis plant, reaching \"whole plant\" or \"full spectrum\" composition is not necessarily an advantage. For enhanced therapeutic effects, desired compositions are attainable by enriching extracts with selected terpenes. These compositions adjust the treatment for various desired medicinal and personal needs.",

We aimed to develop a model to predict the stable THC and CBD dosages after six months of treatment using available baseline patient characteristics. METHODS: In this prospective study, we included all consecutive adult patients (age 18 and above) who exclusively used a single method of cannabis delivery. Telephone interviews were conducted six months post-treatment initiation to assess changes in symptoms and side effects. We prospectively analyzed THC and CBD dosages with respect to demographic variables and patient characteristics in two main groups divided according to cannabis administration method - inhalation or sublingual oil. RESULTS: A total of 3,554 patients were included in the study (2,724 exclusively inhaled cannabis and 830 exclusively consumed cannabis as sublingual oil). The daily THC and CBD doses were significantly higher in the inhalation group than in the sublingual group (p<.001). None of the four models predicting THC and CBD doses in the two groups had satisfactory prediction ability (adjusted R-squared between 0.007 and 0.09). Male gender, unemployed status, tobacco smoking and a lack of concern about cannabis treatment were associated with a higher inhaled THC dose (p<.001). CONCLUSION: Models based on patient characteristics failed to accurately predict the final titration doses of CBD and THC for both inhalation and sublingual administration. Clinical guidelines should maintain a highly individual approach for cannabinoid dosing.",

      "abstract": "In this follow-up study, we investigated the abundance and compartmentalization of blood plasma extracellular miRNA (exmiRNA) into lipid-based carriers-blood plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) and non-lipid-based carriers-extracellular condensates (ECs) during SIV infection. We also assessed how combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), administered in conjunction with phytocannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), altered the abundance and compartmentalization of exmiRNAs in the EVs and ECs of SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs). Unlike cellular miRNAs, exmiRNAs in blood plasma may serve as minimally invasive disease indicators because they are readily detected in stable forms. The stability of exmiRNAs in cell culture fluids and body fluids (urine, saliva, tears, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), semen, blood) is based on their association with different carriers (lipoproteins, EVs, and ECs) that protect them from the activities of endogenous RNases. Here, we showed that in the blood plasma of uninfected control RMs, significantly less exmiRNAs were associated with EVs compared to the level (30% higher) associated with ECs, and that SIV infection altered the profile of EVs and ECs miRNAome (Manuscript 1). In people living with HIV (PLWH), host-encoded miRNAs regulate both host and viral gene expression, which may serve as indicators of disease or treatment biomarkers. The profile of miRNAs in blood plasma of PLWH (elite controllers versus viremic patients) are different, indicating that HIV may alter host miRNAome. However, there are no studies assessing the effect of cART or other substances used by PLWH, such as THC, on the abundance of exmiRNA and their association with EVs and ECs. Moreover, longitudinal exmiRNA profiles following SIV infection, treatment with THC, cART, or THC+cART remains unclear. Here, we serially analyzed miRNAs associated with blood plasma derived EVs and ECs. Methods: Paired EVs and ECs were separated from EDTA blood plasma of male Indian rhesus macaques (RMs) in five treatment groups, including VEH/SIV, VEH/SIV/cART, THC/SIV, THC/SIV/cART, or THC alone. Separation of EVs and ECs was achieved with the unparalleled nano-particle purification tool ─PPLC, a state-of-the-art, innovative technology equipped with gradient agarose bead sizes and a fast fraction collector that allows high resolution separation and retrieval of preparative quantities of sub-populations of extracellular structures. Global miRNA profiles of the paired EVs and ECs were determined with RealSeq Biosciences (Santa Cruz, CA) custom sequencing platform by conducting small RNA (sRNA)-seq. The sRNA-seq data were analyzed using various bioinformatic tools. Validation of key exmiRNA was performed using specific TaqMan microRNA stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. Results: We investigated the effect of cART, THC, or both cART and THC together on the abundance and compartmentalization of blood plasma exmiRNA in EVs and ECs in SIV-infected RMs. As shown in Manuscript 1 of this series, were in uninfected RMs, ~30% of exmiRNAs were associated with ECs, we confirmed in this follow up manuscript that exmiRNAs were present in both lipid-based carriers-EVs and non-lipid-based carriers-ECs, with 29.5 to 35.6% and 64.2 to 70.5 % being associated with EVs and ECs, respectively. Remarkably, the different treatments (cART, THC) have distinct effects on the enrichment and compartmentalization pattern of exmiRNAs. In the VEH/SIV/cART group, 12 EV-associated and 15 EC-associated miRNAs were significantly downregulated. EV-associated miR-206, a muscle-specific miRNA that is present in blood, was higher in the VEH/SIV/ART compared to the VEH/SIV group. ExmiR-139-5p that was implicated in endocrine resistance, focal adhesion, lipid and atherosclerosis, apoptosis, and breast cancer by miRNA-target enrichment analysis was significantly lower in VEH/SIV/cART compared to VEH/SIV, irrespective of the compartment. With respect to THC treatment, 5 EV-associated and 21 EC-associated miRNAs were significantly lower in the VEH/THC/SIV. EV-associated miR-99a-5p was higher in VEH/THC/SIV compared to VEH/SIV, while miR-335-5p counts were significantly lower in both EVs and ECs of THC/SIV compared to VEH/SIV. EVs from SIV/cART/THC combined treatment group have significant increases in the count of eight (miR-186-5p, miR-382-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-652, miR-10a-5p, miR-657, miR-140-5p, miR-29c-3p) miRNAs, all of which were lower in VEH/SIV/cART group. Analysis of miRNA-target enrichment showed that this set of eight miRNAs were implicated in endocrine resistance, focal adhesions, lipid and atherosclerosis, apoptosis, and breast cancer as well as cocaine and amphetamine addiction. In ECs and EVs, combined THC and cART treatment significantly increased miR-139-5p counts compared to VEH/SIV group. Significant alterations in these host miRNAs in both EVs and ECs in the untreated and treated (cART, THC, or both) RMs indicate the persistence of host responses to infection or treatments, and this is despite cART suppression of viral load and THC suppression of inflammation. To gain further insight into the pattern of miRNA alterations in EVs and ECs and to assess potential cause-and-effect relationships, we performed longitudinal miRNA profile analysis, measured in terms of months (1 and 5) post-infection (MPI). We uncovered miRNA signatures associated with THC or cART treatment of SIV-infected macaques in both EVs and ECs. While the number of miRNAs was significantly higher in ECs relative to EVs for all groups (VEH/SIV, SIV/cART, THC/SIV, THC/SIV/cART, and THC) longitudinally from 1 MPI to 5 MPI, treatment with cART and THC have longitudinal effects on the abundance and compartmentalization pattern of exmiRNAs in the two carriers. As shown in Manuscript 1 where SIV infection led to longitudinal suppression of EV-associated miRNA-128-3p, administration of cART to SIV-infected RMs did not increase miR-128-3p but resulted in longitudinal increases in six EV-associated miRNAs (miR-484, miR-107, miR-206, miR-184, miR-1260b, miR-6132). Furthermore, administration of cART to THC treated SIV-infected RMs resulted in a longitudinal decrease in three EV-associated miRNAs (miR-342-3p, miR-100-5p, miR181b-5p) and a longitudinal increase in three EC-associated miRNAs (miR-676-3p, miR-574-3p, miR-505-5p). The longitudinally altered miRNAs in SIV-infected RMs may indicate disease progression, while in the cART Group and the THC Group, the longitudinally altered miRNAs may serve as biomarkers of response to treatment. Conclusions: This paired EVs and ECs miRNAome analyses provided a comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal summary of the host exmiRNA responses to SIV infection and the impact of THC, cART, or THC and cART together on the miRNAome during SIV infection. Overall, our data point to previously unrecognized alterations in the exmiRNA profile in blood plasma following SIV infection. Our data also indicate that cART and THC treatment independently and in combination may alter both the abundance and the compartmentalization of several exmiRNA related to various disease and biological processes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The medical and recreational use of cannabis has increased in the United States. Its chronic use can have detrimental effects on the neurobiology of the brain-effects that are age-dependent. This was an exploratory study looking at the effects of chronically inhaled vaporized cannabis on brain structure in adult female mice. METHODS: Adult mice were exposed daily to vaporized cannabis (10.3% THC and 0.05% CBD) or placebo for 21 days. Following cessation of treatment mice were examined for changes in brain structure using voxel-based morphometry and diffusion weighted imaging MRI. Data from each imaging modality were registered to a 3D mouse MRI atlas with 139 brain areas. RESULTS: Mice showed volumetric changes in the forebrain particularly the prefrontal cortex, accumbens, ventral pallidum, and limbic cortex. Many of these same brain areas showed changes in water diffusivity suggesting alterations in gray matter microarchitecture. DISCUSSION: These data are consistent with much of the clinical findings on cannabis use disorder. The sensitivity of the dopaminergic system to the daily exposure of vaporized cannabis raises concerns for abuse liability in drug naïve adult females that initiate chronic cannabis use."

METHODS: Data were from an online survey of youth and young adults in urban areas of Texas with complete data (n = 2,307) in spring 2019 (baseline) and spring 2020 (12-month follow-up). Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations between self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, or comorbid depression and anxiety at baseline and past 30-day e-cigarette use with nicotine or THC at 12-month follow-up. Analyses adjusted for baseline demographics and baseline past 30-day e-cigarette, combustible tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol use and stratified by race/ethnicity, gender, grade level, and SES. RESULTS: Participants were 16-23 years old, 58.1% female and 37.9% Hispanic. At baseline, 14.7% reported symptoms of comorbid depression and anxiety, 7.9% depression, and 4.7% anxiety. Prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use at 12-month follow-up was 10.4% with nicotine and 10.3% with THC. Symptoms of depression and comorbid depression and anxiety at baseline were significantly associated with both nicotine and THC use in e-cigarettes 12 months later. Symptoms of anxiety were associated with nicotine use in e-cigarettes 12 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of anxiety and depression may be important indicators of future nicotine and THC vaping among young people. Clinicians should be aware of groups most at risk who may benefit from substance use counseling and intervention.",

Here, we hypothesized that peripubertal Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (aTHC) may affect the impact of prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) or perinatal THC (pTHC) exposure in adult rats. We found that MAM and pTHC-exposed rats, when compared to the control group (CNT), were characterized by adult phenotype relevant to schizophrenia, including social withdrawal and cognitive impairment, as revealed by social interaction test and novel object recognition test, respectively. At the molecular level, we observed an increase in cannabinoid CB1 receptor (Cnr1) and/or dopamine D2/D3 receptor (Drd2, Drd3) gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of adult MAM or pTHC-exposed rats, which we attributed to changes in DNA methylation at key regulatory gene regions. Interestingly, aTHC treatment significantly impaired social behavior, but not cognitive performance in CNT groups. In pTHC rats, aTHC did not exacerbate the altered phenotype nor dopaminergic signaling, while it reversed cognitive deficit in MAM rats by modulating Drd2 and Drd3 gene expression. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effects of peripubertal THC exposure may depend on individual differences related to dopaminergic neurotransmission.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary phytocannabinoid responsible for the psychoactive properties of cannabis and is known to interact with the endocannabinoid system, which is functionally present in the male reproductive system. Since cannabis consumption is the highest among reproductive aged males, the current study aimed to further investigate the effects of THC exposure to phenotypical, physiological, and molecular parameters in sperm. Bull sperm of known fertility were used as a translational model for human sperm and subjected to in vitro treatment with physiologically relevant experimental doses of THC. Sperm parameters, capacitation, apoptosis, and transcript levels were evaluated following treatment. RESULTS: Motility, morphology, and viability of bovine sperm was unaltered from THC exposure. However, 0.32µM of THC caused an increased proportion of capacitating sperm (p < 0.05) compared to control and vehicle group sperm. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 39 genes were found to be differentially expressed by 0.032µM THC exposure, 196 genes were differentially expressed by 0.32µM THC exposure, and 33 genes were differentially expressed by 3.2µM THC. Secondary analysis reveals pathways involving development, nucleosomes, ribosomes and translation, and cellular metabolism to be significantly enriched. CONCLUSION: Phytocannabinoid exposure to sperm may adversely affect sperm function by stimulating premature capacitation. These findings also show for the first time that spermatozoal transcripts may be altered by THC exposure. These results add to previous research demonstrating the molecular effects of cannabinoids on sperm and warrant further research into the effects of cannabis on male fertility.",

      "abstract": "With the recent legalization of inhaled cannabis for medicinal and recreational use, the elderly represents one of the newest, rapidly growing cohorts of cannabis users. To understand the neurobiological effects of cannabis on the aging brain, 19-20 months old mice were divided into three groups exposed to vaporized cannabis containing ~10% Δ9-THC, ~10% CBD, or placebo for 30 min each day. Voxel based morphometry, diffusion weighted imaging, and resting state functional connectivity data were gathered after 28 days of exposure and following a two-week washout period. Tail-flick, open field, and novel object preference tests were conducted to explore analgesic, anxiolytic, and cognitive effects of cannabis, respectively. Vaporized cannabis high in Δ9-THC and CBD achieved blood levels reported in human users. Mice showed antinociceptive effects to chronic Δ9-THC without tolerance while the anxiolytic and cognitive effects of Δ9-THC waned with treatment. CBD had no effect on any of the behavioral measures. Voxel based morphometry showed a decrease in midbrain dopaminergic volume to chronic Δ9-THC followed but an increase after a two-week washout. Fractional anisotropy values were reduced in the same area by chronic Δ9-THC, suggesting a reduction in gray matter volume. Cannabis high in CBD but not THC increased network strength and efficiency, an effect that persisted after washout. These data would indicate chronic use of inhaled cannabis high in Δ9-THC can be an effective analgesic but not for treatment of anxiety or cognitive decline. The dopaminergic midbrain system was sensitive to chronic Δ9-THC but not CBD showing robust plasticity in volume and water diffusivity prior to and following drug cessation an effect possibly related to the abuse liability of Δ9-THC. Chronic inhaled CBD resulted in enhanced global network connectivity that persisted after drug cessation. The behavioral consequences of this sustained change in brain connectivity remain to be determined."

Previously, we have shown that a low dose chronic THC treatment improves learning abilities in old whereas impairs learning abilities in young mice. The mechanism underlying this age-dependent effect is not known. Dendritic spine stability is a key for memory formation, therefore we hypothesized that THC affects spine dynamics in an age-dependent manner. We applied longitudinal 2-photon in vivo imaging to 3- and 18-month-old mice treated with 3 mg/kg/day of THC for 28 days via an osmotic pump. We imaged the same dendritic segments before, during and after the treatment and assessed changes in spine density and stability. We now show that in old mice THC improved spine stability resulting in a long-lasting increase in spine density. In contrast, in young mice THC transiently increased spine turnover and destabilized the spines.",

      "abstract": "Several new psychoactive substances (NPS) are responsible for intoxication involving the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Among NPS, synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) provoked side effects in humans characterized by tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, breathing difficulty, apnoea, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest. Therefore, the present study investigated the cardio-respiratory (MouseOx Plus; EMKA electrocardiogram (ECG) and plethysmography TUNNEL systems) and vascular (BP-2000 systems) effects induced by 1-naphthalenyl (1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-methanone (JWH-018; 0.3-3-6 mg/kg) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC; 0.3-3-6 mg/kg), administered in awake CD-1 male mice. The results showed that higher doses of JWH-018 (3-6 mg/kg) induced deep and long-lasting bradycardia, alternated with bradyarrhythmia, spaced out by sudden episodes of tachyarrhythmias (6 mg/kg), and characterized by ECG electrical parameters changes, sustained bradypnea, and systolic and transient diastolic hypertension. Otherwise, Δ9-THC provoked delayed bradycardia (minor intensity tachyarrhythmias episodes) and bradypnea, also causing a transient and mild hypertensive effect at the tested dose range. These effects were prevented by both treatment with selective CB1 (AM 251, 6 mg/kg) and CB2 (AM 630, 6 mg/kg) receptor antagonists and with the mixture of the antagonists AM 251 and AM 630, even if in a different manner. Cardio-respiratory and vascular symptoms could be induced by peripheral and central CB1 and CB2 receptors stimulation, which could lead to both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems activation. These findings may represent a starting point for necessary future studies aimed at exploring the proper antidotal therapy to be used in SCs-intoxicated patient management.",

Several pharmacological therapies have emerged in recent years, but the clinical use of cannabis extracts in older patients with AD is constantly growing. This retrospective, analytical, observational, spontaneous trial aimed to enhance the clinical action of THC: CBD cannabis extract administration in AD patients with severe symptoms such as agitation, weight loss, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbance. METHODS: Thirty patients (9 men and 21 women) diagnosed with mild, moderate, or severe AD, aged 65-90 years, appealing to our Second Opinion Medical Consultation (Modena, Italy), were enrolled and required to use oil-diluted cannabis extract, Bedrocan® (22% THC, 0.5% CBD, Olive Oil 50 ml), twice a day for 12 weeks. The efficacy of cannabinoid therapy was evaluated at baseline and 12 weeks after therapy, employing three self-administered questionnaires completed by the parents of the enrolled patients: NPI-Q, CMAI, and MMSE. KEY FINDINGS: The NPI-Q demonstrated a reduction (p<0.0001) in agitation, apathy, irritability, sleep disturbances, and eating disturbances, consequently improving caregiver distress. Levels of physically and verbally aggressive behaviours, measured using the CMAI questionnaire, were lower (p<0.0001) in all patients. The MMSSE questionnaire confirmed a significant decrease (p<0.0001) in cognitive impairment in 45% of the patients. CONCLUSION: Our anecdotical, spontaneous, and observational study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of oil-diluted cannabis extract in patients with AD. The limitations of our study are: 1) small patient cohort, 2) absence of control group, 3) self-administered questionnaires that are the most practical but not objective instruments to assess the neurologic functions of AD patients.",

      "abstract": "Evaluation of Cannabis consumption is required for many purposes (i.e., workplace drug testing and driving license renewal). Hair analysis represents the most adopted and reliable approach for the investigation of repeated or chronic exposure to Cannabis. The main markers are the Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its main metabolite, 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH), as stated by the Society of Hair Testing (SoHT) and the European Workplace Drug Testing Society (EWDTS). In this paper we presented an observational study on the hair concentrations of THC and THC-COOH and influences due to age, gender, consumption habits, and hair features. Data were collected from analysis of scalp hair samples (3-cm proximal segment) provided by subjects tested for THC consumption for personal purposes (i.e., workplace drug testing, personal use proving). The subjects provided an informed consent and a short questionnaire. A new analytical method was previously developed and then adopted. It consisted in a hydrolysis (1 mL of 1 M NaOH at 65 °C, 20 min) and a liquid-liquid extraction (with hexane/ethyl acetate,90/10, v/v in presence of 1.5 mL of H2SO4 1 M) of 25 mg of hair. A liquid chromatograph - tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) equipped with a C18 column was used. The acquisition was in multiple reaction monitoring for the following transitions: 315→259, 193 m/z, for THC; 318→196, 123 m/z, for THC-d3; 345→299, 193 m/z for THC-COOH; 348→196, 302 m/z for THC-COOH-d3. Correlation between THC and THC-COOH hair concentrations was analyzed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. In order to study the influences of several variables, a new value, Sqrt(THC*THCCOOH), was adopted. Its effectiveness and reliability were proved by the Principal Component Analysis. Relationships between the Sqrt(THC*THCCOOH) and the variables were studied through the Stepwise regression (p = 0.05). The normality of data distribution was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The Lower limits of quantification were 10.0 (THC) and 0.2 (THC-COOH) pg/mg. Accuracy and precision always met the acceptable criteria. Recoveries were > 78% and ion suppression was observed for both the compounds. Data from 126 hair samples were included in this study: 54 subjects(42.9%) were positive both for THC and THC-COOH; none of the samples was positive for a single substance. Concentrations ranged from 0.18 to 1.75 ng/mg (median: 0.78 ng/mg) for THC and from 0.04 to 0.85 ng/mg (median: 0.31 ng/mg) for THC-COOH. Cannabinoids levels seemed to decrease with the age, with lower amounts in the subjects aged > 40 years (p < 0.05). Also years of consumption seemed to have a significant impact on hair concentrations, as higher levels were observed in consumers from > 10 years (p = 0.013). Moreover, this study further provided evidences of a significant reduction of THC and THC-COOH in bleached hair (p = 0.042).",

Under physiological conditions, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) appears to be detrimental for fertility. However, cannabis is also commonly used for stress-relief. THC acts on the endocannabinoid receptors in granulosa cells (GCs), which affect oocyte competency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of THC on in vitro bovine granulosa cell viability, apoptosis, and stress response pathway. GCs were cultured in vitro in the presence of clinically relevant therapeutic and recreational plasma doses of THC. Cortisol doses reflecting normal and elevated plasma levels were used to evaluate the effects of THC under induced stress in vitro. No effect of THC was observed on cell viability or apoptosis. High and low cortisol concentrations caused significant increases in 11β-HSD1 mRNA expression (n = 6, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, when combined with high [THC], there was a significant decrease in 11β-HSD1 expression compared to high and low cortisol treatments alone (p < 0.001, p < 0.05). GR expression was unaffected by cortisol treatments, and low [THC] treatment maintained increased expression in the presence of high and low cortisol treatments (n = 6, p < 0.01, p < 0.0001).

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to examine the effect of two cannabinoids and their combination in peripheral neuropathic pain. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, trial with treatment arms for cannabidiol (CBD), tetra-hydro-cannabinol (THC), CBD and THC combination (CBD/THC), and placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and flexible drug doses (CBD 5-50 mg, THC 2.5-25 mg, and CBD/THC 5 mg/2.5 mg-50 mg/25 mg). Treatment periods of 8-week duration were proceeded by 1 week for baseline observations. Patients with painful polyneuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia and peripheral nerve injury (traumatic or surgical) failing at least one previous evidence-based pharmacological treatment were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the change in weekly average of daily pain measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS). Trail Making Test (TMT) was used as one of the tests of mental functioning. RESULTS: In all, 145 patients were included in the study of which 118 were randomized and 115 included in the intention-to-treat analysis. None of the treatments reduced pain compared to placebo (p = 0.04-0.60). Effect sizes as estimated in week 8 (positive values worse and negative better than placebo) were CBD mean 1.14 NRS points (95% CI 0.11-2.19), THC 0.38 (CI -0.65 to 1.4) and CBD/THC -0.12 (-1.13 to 0.89).

Prenatal exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, is related to affect fetal nervous system development. In our present study, we administered THC to pregnant mice from gestational day 5.5-12.5. Differences in neuronal cell composition and organization between the two groups were found by staining sections of the offspring hippocampus at PND21. In addition, RNA-seq of hippocampal tissue also suggested differences in gene expression due to THC treatment, especially significant enrichment to neurogenesis and neural differentiation. Subsequently, the effect of THC treatment on the proliferation and differentiation capacity of neural stem cells (NSCs) was confirmed. Based on the RNA-seq results, we selected the differentially expressed transcription factor MEF2C for validation. The effect of THC treatment on NSCs differentiation was found to be regulated by knocking down the expression of MEF2C in NSCs. Considering that THC is an agonist of cannabinoid receptor (CB1R), the differentiation outcome of NSC after THC treatment was significantly rescued, by pretreating with the CB1R inhibitor Rimonabant. Notably, pretreatment with Rimonabant restored the expression of MEF2C. Taken together, the present results suggested that THC regulated the MEF2C pathway through CB1R and had an impact on hippocampal neurodevelopment.",

      "abstract": "Patients with the genetic blistering skin condition epidermolysis bullosa (EB) report severe pain as a consequence of skin and mucous membrane lesions including blisters, wounds, and scars. Adequate symptom alleviation is not often achieved using conventional pharmacologic interventions. Finding novel approaches to pain care in EB is imperative to improve the quality of life of patients living with EB. There are several anecdotal reports on the use of cannabinoid-based medicines (CBMs) by EB patients to reduce the burden of symptoms. However, controlled clinical investigations assessing these reported effects are lacking. As the pain quality \"unpleasantness\" delineates EB pain, we hypothesize the modulation of affective pain processing in the brain by way of intervention with CBMs comprising the cannabinoids Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol-objectified by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The C4EB study is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover trial. Adult patients with the diagnosis epidermolysis bullosa, reporting chronic pain will be eligible to participate. Following baseline measurements, participants will be randomized to receive the sublingually administered interventions placebo and Transvamix® in forward or reversed orders, each for two weeks and separated by a washout. The primary outcome is the difference in numeric rating scale pain scores between grouped interventions, using affective descriptors within the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2. Secondary outcomes include pain self-efficacy, concomitant analgesic medication-use and adverse events. Additionally, fMRI will be employed to assess brain connectivity related to neuroanatomic pain circuits at baseline, placebo and Transvamix® interventions. The study was approved by the ethical committee at the University Medical Center of Groningen in the Netherlands. Results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Although perceived as relatively harmless and nonaddictive, adolescent cannabis use significantly increases the likelihood of developing cannabis use disorder in adulthood, especially for high-potency cannabis. Risky decision-making is associated with chronic cannabis use, but given confounds of human studies, it remains unclear whether adolescent cannabis exposure and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) potency specifically predicts risky decision-making or influences cognitive response to the drug later in life. OBJECTIVE: To leverage a human data set of cannabis users and a rat model to evaluate the long-term outcomes of adolescent THC exposure on adult decision-making and impulse control. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This translational rat study tested the link between adolescent THC exposure and adulthood decision-making. A reanalysis of a previously published dataset of human chronic cannabis users was conducted to evaluate decision-making phenotypes. Computational modeling assessed the human and animal results in a single framework. Data were collected from 2017 to 2020 and analyzed from 2020 to 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Decision-making was measured by the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Rat Gambling Task (rGT). Impulse control was assessed in the rat model. Computational modeling was used to determine reward and punishment learning rates and learning strategy used by cannabis users and THC-exposed rats. Cell-specific molecular measures were conducted in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. RESULTS: Of 37 participants, 24 (65%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 33.0 (8.3) years. Chronic cannabis users (n = 22; mean [SE] IGT score, -5.182 [1.262]) showed disadvantageous decision-making compared with controls (n = 15; mean [SE] IGT score, 7.133 [2.687]; Cohen d = 1.436). Risky choice was associated with increased reward learning (mean [SE] IGT score: cannabis user, 0.170 [0.018]; control, 0.046 [0.008]; Cohen d = 1.895) and a strategy favoring exploration vs long-term gains (mean [SE] IGT score: cannabis user, 0.088 [0.012]; control, 0.020 [0.002]; Cohen d = 2.218). Rats exposed to high-dose THC but not low-dose THC during adolescence also showed increased risky decision-making (mean [SE] rGT score: vehicle, 46.17 [7.02]; low-dose THC, 69.45 [6.01]; high-dose THC, 21.97 [11.98]; Cohen d = 0.433) and elevated reward learning rates (mean [SE] rGT score: vehicle, 0.17 [0.01]; low-dose THC, 0.10 [0.01]; high-dose THC, 0.24 [0.06]; Cohen d = 1.541) during task acquisition. These animals were also uniquely susceptible to increased cognitive impairments after reexposure to THC in adulthood, which was correlated with even greater reward learning (r = -0.525; P < .001) and a shift in strategy (r = 0.502; P < .001), similar to results seen in human cannabis users. Molecular studies revealed that adolescent THC dose differentially affected cannabinoid-1 receptor messenger RNA expression in the prelimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala in a layer- and cell-specific manner. Further, astrocyte glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA expression associated with cognitive deficits apparent with adult THC reexposure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this translational study, high-dose adolescent THC exposure was associated with cognitive vulnerability in adulthood, especially with THC re-exposure. These data also suggest a link between astrocytes and cognition that altogether provides important insights regarding the neurobiological genesis of risky cannabis use that may help promote prevention and treatment efforts.",

      "abstract": "Background: Retail sales of Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products have increased in the U.S. market since the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill, and there is currently little regulation of marketing/sales and limited related safety standards in many states. After thousands of calls to poison control centers (40% for individuals under 18 years old and 70% requiring health care facility evaluation), the Food and Drug Administration issued warnings on Delta-8 THC products, stating their psychoactive effects and that some manufacturers may synthesize Delta-8 using unsafe household chemicals. The current study describes the Delta-8 THC retail sales environment in Fort Worth, Texas. Given its relatively inexpensive manufacturing and that low prices are a major determinant of cannabis use, the price of Delta-8 THC products was examined. This study also examined whether retail outlets in areas with greater socioeconomic deprivation had higher odds of selling Delta-8 THC products. This is important because if Delta-8 THC retailers are disproportionately located in more socioeconomically deprived communities, residents of these communities can more easily access these products and may have higher risk of adverse consequences. Methods: Potential Delta-8 THC retailers were selected by identifying lists of current retail locations with alcohol, cannabidiol, and/or tobacco licenses in Fort Worth. Trained research assistants called outlets in September and October 2021 to query about sales of products containing Delta-8 THC. The response rate was 69% (n=1,223). Outlets' 9-digit zip codes were merged with Area Deprivation Index scores. Products and purported minimum age were described. Chi-squared and Student's t-tests were used. Results: Eleven percent of outlets (n=133) reported selling Delta-8 THC. Ninety-six percent sold vapes and/or \"flower\" (i.e., hemp leaves coated with Delta-8 THC distillate) and 76% sold edibles. Among the least expensive products available, edibles cost, on average, $8.58 less than flower/vapes (p<0.001). Outlets that sold Delta-8 THC were located in areas with greater deprivation (p=0.02). Most reported a minimum purchase age of 21; however, 4% reported 18 years or no minimum age. Conclusions: Delta-8 THC retail outlets were disproportionately located in areas with more socioeconomic deprivation. Legal intervention such as zoning, minimum age, and tax laws may help reduce Delta-8 THC-related disparities.",

      "abstract": "In November 2018, the UK’s Home Office established a legal route for eligible patients to be prescribed cannabis-based products for medicinal use in humans (CBPMs) as unlicensed medicines. These include liquid cannabis extracts for oral administration (“oils”) and dried flowers for inhalation (“flos”). Smoking of CBPMs is expressly prohibited. To date, THC-predominant cannabis flowers remain the most prescribed CBPMs in project Twenty21 (T21), the first multi-center, prospective, observational UK cannabis patient registry. This observational, prospective data review analyzes patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) collected by T21 associated with the inhalation of KHIRON 20/1, the most prescribed CBPM in the project. PROMS collected at baseline and at subsequent 3-month follow-up included health-related quality of life (HRQoL), general mood, and sleep. Condition-specific measures of illness severity were performed with the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7). Participants (N = 344) were mostly males (77.6%, average age = 38.3) diagnosed mainly with chronic pain (50.9%) and anxiety-related disorders (25.3%). Inhalation of KHIRON 20/1 was associated with a marked increase in self-reported HRQoL, general mood, and sleep (N = 344; p < 0.001). Condition-specific assessments showed significant improvements in pain severity (T = 6.67; p < 0.001) and interference (T = 7.19; p < 0.001) in patients using KHIRON 20/1 for chronic pain (N = 174). Similar results were found for patients diagnosed with anxiety-related disorders (N = 107; T = 12.9; p < 0.001). Our results indicate that controlled inhalation of pharmaceutical grade, THC-predominant cannabis flos is associated with a significant improvement in patient-reported pain scores, mood, anxiety, sleep disturbances and overall HRQoL in a treatment-resistant clinical population."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), an active component of cannabis, can cause anxiety in some users during intoxication. Cannabidiol (CBD), another constituent of cannabis, has anxiolytic properties suggesting that cannabis products containing CBD in addition to THC may produce less anxiety than THC-only products. Findings to date around this issue have been inconclusive and could conceivably depend on moderating factors such as baseline anxiety levels in users. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined whether anxiety following single doses of vaporised THC, CBD and THC/CBD might be explained by state and trait anxiety levels at baseline. METHODS: A placebo-controlled, randomised, within-subjects study including 26 healthy recreational cannabis users tested the effects of vaporised THC-dominant cannabis (13.75 mg THC), CBD-dominant cannabis (13.75 mg CBD), THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis (13.75 mg THC/13.75 mg CBD) and placebo cannabis on anxiety. Self-rated trait anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). State levels of anxiety were objectively assessed with a computer-based emotional Stroop task (EST) and subjectively rated with the STAI-state questionnaire and a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Both THC and THC/CBD significantly increased self-rated state anxiety compared to placebo. State anxiety after THC/CBD was significantly lower than after THC alone. THC-induced anxiety was independent of anxiety at baseline. When baseline anxiety was low, CBD completely counteracted THC-induced anxiety; however, when baseline anxiety was high, CBD did not counteract THC-induced anxiety. There were no effects of any treatment condition on the EST. CONCLUSION: Overall, the study demonstrated that the THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis induces less state anxiety than THC-dominant cannabis.",

      "abstract": "Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the gold standard for clinical trials. While there are established standards to avoid unblinding, in RCTs using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) containing cannabinoids, however, accidental unblinding and intentional self-unbinding must be considered as a particular issue, since THC tests are widely available. To investigate unblinding rates in an RCT using a THC-containing cannabinoid, we re-contacted 54 out of 97 participants of the CANNA-TICS trial who had participated in our study center in Hannover. Of the 54 participants, 53 could be reached. Of these, one participant (2%) stated that she had unblinded herself intentionally during the treatment phase, and another three patients (6%) reported intentional unblinding after the end of the treatment. Noteworthy, two patients provided discrepant information and denied self-unblinding during the interview, although during study/clinic visits they had reported having done so. Thus, based on all available information, three participants (6%) unblinded themselves intentionally during the treatment phase and another three (6%) after the end of the treatment. Accidental unblinding during the treatment phase was reported by 4/54 participants (7%) (during study visits). Since one participant reported both intentional self-unblinding (during the interview) and accidental unblinding (during a study visit), the total unblinding rate was 17% (n = 9). Of these, seven participants (13%) reported unblinding during the treatment phase. When asked in the interview whether they knew that self-unblinding would have been possible, only 34% (n = 18/53) of participants stated that they had been aware of this possibility. Thus, altogether 33% (n = 6/18) of those being informed about the possibility of self-unblinding did so and half of them (3/18, 17 %) during the treatment phase. It can be expected that in parallel to increasing knowledge of medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, more and more people will also be informed about the availability of THC tests. Hence, in future RCTs using THC-containing cannabinoids, researchers have to take the possibility of accidental and intentional unblinding into consideration, when designing the study."

The psychoactive substance delta-9-tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC) contained in cannabis may affect driving abilities. Therefore, the aims of this study (open-label, monocentric, nonrandomized) were to evaluate blood and saliva concentrations of THC after oral administration of medical cannabis and to assess the time needed for THC levels to decline below a value ensuring legal driving. The study involved 20 patients with documented chronic pain using long-term medical cannabis therapy. They were divided into two groups and treated with two different doses of cannabis in the form of gelatin capsules (62.5 mg or 125 mg). In all patients, the amount of THC was assessed in saliva and in blood at pre-defined time intervals before and after administration. THC levels in saliva were detected at zero in all subjects following administration of both doses at all-time intervals after administration. Assessment of THC levels in blood, however, showed positive findings in one subject 9 h after administration of the lower dose and in one patient who had been given a higher dose 7 h after administration. Our finding suggested that for an unaffected ability to drive, at least 9-10 h should elapse from the last cannabis use.",

Although the basal ganglia (BG) is a major target and reservoir of HIV in the CNS (Chaganti et al. in Aids 33:1843-1852, 2019; Mintzopoulos et al. in Magn Reson Med 81:2896-2904, 2019), whether BG produces EVs and the effect of HIV and/or the phytocannabinoid-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on BG-EVs and HIV neuropathogenesis remain unknown. METHODS: We used the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of HIV and THC treatment in rhesus macaques (Molina et al. in AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 27:585-592, 2011) to demonstrate for the first time that BG contains EVs (BG-EVs), and that BG-EVs cargo and function are modulated by SIV and THC. We also used primary astrocytes from the brains of wild type (WT) and CX3CR1+/GFP mice to investigate the significance of BG-EVs in CNS cells. RESULTS: Significant changes in BG-EV-associated miRNA specific to SIV infection and THC treatment were observed. BG-EVs from SIV-infected rhesus macaques (SIV EVs) contained 11 significantly downregulated miRNAs. Remarkably, intervention with THC led to significant upregulation of 37 miRNAs in BG-EVs (SIV-THC EVs). Most of these miRNAs are predicted to regulate pathways related to inflammation/immune regulation, TLR signaling, Neurotrophin TRK receptor signaling, and cell death/response. BG-EVs activated WT and CX3CR1+/GFP astrocytes and altered the expression of CD40, TNFα, MMP-2, and MMP-2 gene products in primary mouse astrocytes in an EV and CX3CR1 dependent manners. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a role for BG-EVs as a vehicle with potential to disseminate HIV- and THC-induced changes within the CNS.",

Dysregulation of macrophage function is involved in the pathogenesis of different inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. In our research, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the phytocannabinoids D9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) on macrophage activation. Macrophages from young and aged C57BL/6 mice were activated in vitro in the presence of pure cannabinoids or cannabis extracts. The phenotype of the cells, nitric oxide (NO•) secretion, and cytokine secretion were examined. In addition, these treatments were administered to murine colitis model. The clinical statuses of mice, levels of colon infiltrating macrophages, and inflammatory cytokines in the blood, were evaluated. We demonstrated inhibition of macrophage NO• and cytokine secretion and significant effects on expression of cell surface molecules. In the murine model, clinical scores were improved and macrophage colon infiltration reduced following treatment. We identified higher activity of cannabis extracts as compared with pure cannabinoids. Each treatment had a unique effect on cytokine composition. Overall, our results establish that the effects of cannabinoid treatments differ. A better understanding of the reciprocal relationship between cannabinoids and immunity is essential to design targeted treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with metabolic syndrome, which often includes obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Several studies in mice and humans have implicated the involvement of the gut microbiome in NAFLD. While cannabis and its phytocannabinoids may potentially be beneficial for treating metabolic disorders such as NAFLD, their effects on liver diseases and gut microbiota profile have yet to be addressed. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of the two major cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), on NAFLD progression. METHODS: NAFLD was induced by feeding mice a high fat-cholesterol diet (HFCD) for 6 weeks. During this period, the individual cannabinoids, THC or CBD, were added to the experimental diets at a concentration of 2.5 or 2.39 mg/kg. Profile of lipids, liver enzymes, glucose tolerance, and gene expression related to carbohydrate lipids metabolism and liver inflammation was analyzed. The effect of THC or CBD on microbiota composition in the gut was evaluated. RESULTS: While not alleviating hepatic steatosis, THC or CBD treatment influenced a number of parameters in the HFCD mouse model. CBD increased food intake, improved glucose tolerance, reduced some of the inflammatory response including TNFa and iNOS, and partially mitigated the microbiome dysbiosis observed in the HFCD fed mice. THC produced a much weaker response, only slightly reducing inflammatory-related gene expression and microbiome dysbiosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate the potential therapeutic effects of individual phytocannabinoids are different from the effects of the cannabis plant possessing a mixture of compounds. While CBD may help ameliorate symptoms of NAFLD, THC alone may not be as effective. This disparity can putatively be explained based on changes in the gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "Executive functions including working memory (WM) and attention are altered following Cannabis exposure in humans. To test for similar effects in a rodent model, we exposed adult male rats to acute Cannabis smoke before testing them on touchscreen-based tasks that assess these executive processes. The trial-unique, delayed nonmatching-to-location (TUNL) task was used to evaluate WM, task performance at different spatial pattern separations, and response latencies. The five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) was used to measure attention, impulsivity, perseveration, and response latencies. Rats were exposed acutely to high- Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), low-CBD (Mohawk) and low-THC, high-CBD (Treasure Island) strains of Cannabis smoke using a chamber inhalation system. The effects of Cannabis smoke were directly compared to systemic Δ9-THC injection (3.0 mg/kg; i.p.). TUNL task performance was significantly impaired following acute high-THC smoke exposure or THC injections, but not low-THC smoke exposure, with no effects on response latencies. Fewer total trials and selection trials were also performed following THC injections. Performance was poorer for smaller separation distances in all groups. Neither acute smoke exposure, nor injected THC, impacted attentional processes, impulsivity, perseverations, or response latencies in the 5-CSRTT. Pharmacokinetic analysis of rat plasma revealed significantly higher THC levels following injections than smoke exposure 30 min following treatment. Exposure to low-THC, high-CBD Cannabis smoke significantly increased CBD in plasma, relative to the other treatments. Taken together, our results suggest that WM processes as measured by the TUNL task are more sensitive to THC exposure than the attentional and impulsivity measures assessed using the 5-CSRTT.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a pivotal mechanism of organ injury during clinical stetting for example for cardiopulmonary bypasses. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during I/R induces oxidative stress that promotes endothelial dysfunction, DNA dissociation and local inflammation. In turn, those processes induce cytokine release, resulting in damage to cellular structures and cell death. One of the major psychoactive compounds of Cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), which is known as an anti-inflammatory mediator. Our research aimed to test if Δ9-THC may be protective in the treatment of cardiovascular system dysfunction arising from I/R heart injury. METHODS: Two experimental models were used: isolated rat hearts perfused with the Langendorff method and human cardiac myocytes (HCM) culture. Rat hearts and HCM underwent ex vivo/chemical in vitro I/R protocol with/without Δ9-THC treatment. The following parameters were measured: cell metabolic activity, morphology changes, cell damage as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, ceramide kinase (CERK) activity, ROS level, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and heart hemodynamic parameters. RESULTS: Δ9-THC protected the heart, as evidenced by the improved recovery of cardiac function (p < 0.05, N = 3-6). Cells subjected to I/R showed lower cytoplasmic LDH activity, and 10 μM Δ9-THC treatment reduced cell injury and increased LDH content (p = 0.019, N = 6-9). Morphology changes of HCM-spherical shape, vacuolisation of cytoplasm and swollen mitochondria-were inhibited due to Δ9-THC treatment. I/R condition affected cell viability, but 10 μM Δ9-THC decreased the number of dead cells (p = 0.005, N = 6-9). The total level of CERK was lower in the I/R group, reflecting oxidative/nitrosative stress changes. The administration of Δ9-THC effectively increased the production of CERK to the level of aerobic control (p = 0.028, N = 6-9). ROS level was significantly decreased in I/R cells (p = 0.007, N = 6-8), confirming oxidative stress, while administration of 10 μM Δ9-THC enhanced TAC in cardiomyocytes subjected to I/R (p = 0.010, N = 6-8). CONCLUSIONS: Δ9-THC promotes the viability of cardiomyocytes, improves their metabolic activity, decreases cell damage and restores heart mechanical function, serving as a cardioprotective. We proposed the use of Δ9-THC as a cardioprotective drug to be, administered before onset of I/R protocol.",

      "abstract": "THC has been used as a promising treatment approach for neurological disorders, but the highly psychoactive effects have largely warned off many scientists from pursuing it further. We conducted an intranasal treatment using low-dose THC on 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice daily for 3 months to overcome any potential psychoactive response induced by the systemic delivery. Our results demonstrate that the THC nasal treatment at 0.002 and 0.02 mg/kg significantly slowed the memory decline compared to that in the vehicle-treated transgenic mouse control group. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the Aβ1-40 and 1-42 peptides decreased in the THC-treated groups. The Western blot data indicate that long-term low-dose THC intranasal administration promoted p-tau level reduction and mitochondrial function marker redistribution. The blood biochemical parameter data demonstrate some insignificant changes in cytokine, immunoglobulin, and immune cell profiles during intranasal THC treatment. Intranasal delivery is a non-invasive and convenient method that rapidly targets therapeutics to the brain, minimizing systemic exposure to avoid unwanted adverse effects. Our study provides new insights into the role of low-dose THC intranasal treatment as a pharmacological strategy to counteract alterations in Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive performance.",

Concurrently, there is inadequate evidence-based knowledge to guide clinical practice regarding cannabis and its effects on fertility and early embryonic development. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), during oocyte maturation, and its impact on the developing embryo. Bovine oocytes were matured in vitro for 24 h under clinically relevant doses of THC mimicking plasma levels achieved after therapeutic (0.032 μM) and recreational (0.32 and 3.2 μM) cannabis use. THC-treated oocytes were assessed for development and quality parameters at both the oocyte and embryo level. Characteristics of oocytes treated with cannabinoid receptor antagonists were also assessed. Oocytes treated with 0.32 and 3.2 μM THC, were significantly less likely to reach metaphase II (p < 0.01) and consequently had lower cleavage rates at day 2 post-fertilization (p < 0.0001). Treatment with cannabinoid receptor antagonists restored this effect (p < 0.05). Oocytes that did reach MII showed no differences in spindle morphology. Oocytes treated with 0.032 μM THC had significantly lower connexin mRNA (p < 0.05) (correlated with decreased quality), but this was not confirmed at the protein level. At the blastocyst stage there were no significant differences in developmental rates or the proportion of trophectoderm to inner cell mass cells between the control and treatment groups. These blastocysts, however, displayed an increased level of apoptosis in the 0.32 and 3.2 μM groups (p < 0.0001). Our findings suggest a possible disruptive effect of cannabis on oocyte maturation and early embryonic development."

METHODS: An analysis was conducted of anonymized, propensity score-matched real-world data from the German Pain e-Registry, using a sequential non-inferiority superiority approach, for adult outpatients with neuropathic pain who had initiated treatment with NBX or DRO between 10 March 2017 and 31 December 2019. The primary effectiveness variable was percent change from baseline in a 9-factor aggregated symptom relief (ASR-9) score, a composite index of nine distinct pain- and health-related parameters assessed using validated patient-reported instruments. Safety was assessed by the incidence of physician-confirmed treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), and TRAEs leading to discontinuation. RESULTS: Propensity score-matched data were analyzed for 337 patients treated with NBX and 337 patients treated with DRO. Mean (standard deviation) THC dose over the 24-week evaluation period was 16.6 (6.5) mg for NBX and 17.2 (7.6) mg for DRO (p<0.001). Median (standard error) improvement relative to baseline in the ASR-9 composite score was 55.4% (0.5) for NBX and 40.5% (0.5) for DRO (least squares mean difference, 14.0 (0.7), 95% confidence interval 12.6-15.4; p<0.001), and incidences of TRAEs (21.1 vs 35%) and TRAE-related discontinuations (5.9 vs 14.8%) were significantly lower with NBX than DRO (p<0.001 for both), collectively indicating pre-specified non-inferiority and superiority of NBX. More NBX- than DRO-treated patients discontinued non-cannabinoid background pain medications and rescue analgesics, especially opioid analgesics (p<0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Add-on treatment with cannabinoids is effective for treatment of severe neuropathic pain with inadequate response to established treatments. In daily practice, NBX had superior effectiveness and tolerability compared to DRO. The results emphasize the importance of combining CBD with THC in this patient population."

      "abstract": "Cannabis usage has steadily increased as acceptance is growing for both medical and recreational reasons. Medical cannabis is administered for treatment of chronic pain based on the premise that the endocannabinoid system signals desensitize pain sensor neurons and produce anti-inflammatory effects. The major psychoactive ingredient of cannabis is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that signals mainly through cannabinoid receptor-1 (CBr), which is also present on nonneuron cells including blood platelets of the circulatory system. In vitro, CBr-mediated signaling has been shown to acutely inhibit platelet activation downstream of the platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP)VI. The systemic effects of chronic THC administration on platelet activity and function remain unclear. This study investigates the effects of chronic THC administration on platelet function using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model. Our results show that female and male NHPs consuming a daily THC edible had reduced platelet adhesion, aggregation, and granule secretion in response to select platelet agonists. Furthermore, a change in bioactive lipids (oxylipins) was observed in the female cohort after THC administration. These results indicate that chronic THC edible administration desensitized platelet activity and function in response to GPVI- and G-protein coupled receptor-based activation by interfering with primary and secondary feedback signaling pathways. These observations may have important clinical implications for patients who use medical marijuana and for providers caring for these patients.",

Neither THC nor MIA pretreatments altered activity in assays used to characterize hyperdopaminergic states in adulthood: amphetamine hyperlocomotion and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex. Adolescent THC treatment elicited deficits in spatial memory and enhanced spatial reversal learning in adult female mice in the Morris water maze, while exposure to MIA elicited female-specific deficits in fear extinction learning in adulthood. There were no effects in these assays in adult males, nor were there interactions between THC and MIA in adult females. While doses of poly(I:C) and THC were sufficient to elicit behavioral effects, particularly relating to cognitive performance in females, there was no evidence that adolescent THC exposure synergized with the risk imposed by MIA to worsen behavioral outcomes in adult mice of either sex.",

We report here that a 14-day course of daily Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol treatments administered to adolescent rats and mice (aTHC) leads to profound but selective deficits in synaptic plasticity in two axonal systems in female, and to lesser extent male, hippocampus as assessed in adulthood. Adolescent-THC exposure did not alter basic synaptic transmission (input/output curves) and had only modest effects on frequency facilitation. Nevertheless, aTHC severely impaired the endocannabinoid-dependent long-term potentiation in the lateral perforant path in females of both species, and in male mice; this was reliably associated with impaired acquisition of a component of episodic memory that depends on lateral perforant path function. Potentiation in the Schaffer-commissural (S-C) projection to field CA1 was disrupted by aTHC treatment in females only and this was associated with both a deficit in estrogen effects on S-C synaptic responses and impairments to CA1-dependent spatial (object location) memory. In all the results demonstrate sexually dimorphic and projection system-specific effects of aTHC exposure that could underlie discrete effects of early life cannabinoid usage on adult cognitive function. Moreover they suggest that some of the enduring, sexually dimorphic effects of cannabis use reflect changes in synaptic estrogen action.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Cannabis products containing delta-8-THC became widely available in most of the United States in late 2020 and rapidly became a significant source of revenue for hemp processing companies, especially in states where use of delta-9-THC remains illegal or requires professional authorization for medical use. Scientific research on the use of delta-8-THC is scarce, previous clinical studies included a combined total of 14 participants, leading some state governments to prohibit it until its properties and effects are better understood. Methods: Researchers developed an online survey for delta-8-THC consumers addressing a broad range of issues regarding delta-8-THC, including use for the treatment of health and medical conditions. Previous survey studies on the medical use of cannabis and cannabis products informed survey components. Results: Patterns of delta-8-THC use had both similarities with and differences from the use of delta-9-THC cannabis and products. Administration methods were primarily edibles (64%) and vaping concentrates (48%). About half of the participants (51%) used delta-8-THC to treat a range of health and medical conditions, primarily anxiety or panic attacks (69%), stress (52%), depression or bipolar disorder (46%), and chronic pain (41%). Participants compared delta-8-THC very favorably with both delta-9-THC and pharmaceutical drugs and reported substantial levels of substitution for both. Most participants did not inform their primary care provider of their delta-8-THC use (78%) and were not confident of their primary care provider's ability to integrate medical cannabis into their treatment (70%). Knowledge of effective dosages was low, and participants' knowledge of delta-8-THC was primarily from the Internet and their own experiences. Conclusion: Harm reduction is a central component of public health. Although the legal environment is becoming more restrictive for delta-8-THC in comparison to delta-9-THC, results suggest that delta-8-THC may be equally effective for desired purposes of cannabis use and lower in undesirable or adverse effects. All policies and practices should be informed by empirical evidence. Considerable research will be needed to systematically verify the patterns reported by participants, and collaborations among academic researchers, government, and the cannabis industry may be valuable in developing the knowledge base for delta-8-THC and other cannabinoids.",

The active ingredient of dronabinol is synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is one of the major cannabinoids from Cannabis sativa. Traditional use of cannabis for malaria fever was reported in the world's oldest pharmacopoeia, dating to around 5000 years ago. In this research we report that THC inhibits β-haematin (synthetic haemozoin) and malaria parasite growth. Due the psychoactivity of THC, CBD, the other major naturally occurring cannabinoid that lacks the off-target psychoactive effects of THC, was also tested and inhibited β-haematin but showed only a mild antimalarial activity. To evaluate whether THC inhibit haemozoin formation, we performed a cellular haem fractionation assay that indicated that is not the likely mechanism of action. For the first time, the cannabinoid chemical structure is raised as a new chemical class to be further studied for malaria treatment, aiming to overcome the undesirable psychoactive effects of THC and optimize the antimalarial effects.",

      "abstract": "Long-term cannabis use during adolescence has deleterious effects in brain that are largely ascribed to the activation of cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1Rs) by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC), the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana. Systemic administration of ∆9-THC inhibits acetylcholine release in the prelimbic-prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC). In turn, PL-PFC acetylcholine plays a role in executive activities regulated by CB1R-targeting endocannabinoids, which are generated by cholinergic stimulation of muscarinic-1 receptors (M1Rs). However, the long-term effects of chronic administration of increasing doses of ∆9-THC in adolescent males on the distribution and function of M1 and/or CB1 receptors in the PL-PFC remains unresolved. We used C57BL\\6J male mice pre-treated with vehicle or escalating daily doses of ∆9-THC to begin filling this gap. Electron microscopic immunolabeling showed M1R-immunogold particles on plasma membranes and in association with cytoplasmic membranes in varying sized dendrites and dendritic spines. These dendritic profiles received synaptic inputs from unlabeled, CB1R- and/or M1R-labeled axon terminals in the PL-PFC of both treatment groups. However, there was a size-dependent decrease in total (plasmalemmal and cytoplasmic) M1R gold particles in small dendrites within the PL-PFC of mice receiving ∆9-THC. Whole cell current-clamp recording in PL-PFC slice preparations further revealed that adolescent pretreatment with ∆9-THC attenuates the hyperpolarization and increases the firing rate produced by local muscarinic stimulation. Repeated administration of ∆9-THC during adolescence also reduced spontaneous alternations in a Y-maze paradigm designed for measures of PFC-dependent memory function in adult mice. Our results provide new information implicating M1Rs in cortical dysfunctions resulting from adolescent abuse of marijuana."

      "abstract": "Kratom is a widely abused plant-based drug preparation with a global interest in recent years, well beyond its native grounds in Southeast Asia. Mitragynine, its major psychoactive constituent is known to exhibit opioid-like behavioral effects with resultant neuroplasticity in the brain reward system. Its chronic administration is associated with cognitive impairments in animal studies. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for such a deficit remains elusive. In this study, the involvement of cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors in cognitive deficits after chronic mitragynine exposures was investigated for 28 days (with incremental dose sensitization from 1 to 25 mg/kg) in adult male Swiss albino mice using the IntelliCage® system. Chronic high-dose mitragynine exposure (5-25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]), but not low-dose exposure (1-4 mg/kg, i.p.), induced hyperlocomotion, potentiated the preference for sucrose reward, increased resistance to punishment, and impaired place learning and its reversal. Comparable deficits were also observed after chronic treatments with Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) or morphine (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous). Mitragynine-, morphine-, and THC-induced learning and memory deficits were reversed by co-treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist, NIDA-41020 (10 mg/kg, i.p.). A significant upregulation of CB1 receptor expression was found in the hippocampal CA1 region and ventral tegmental area after chronic high-dose mitragynine and morphine, whereas a downregulation was observed after chronic THC. In conclusion, the present study suggests a plausible role of the CB1 receptor in mediating the dose-dependent cognitive deficits after chronic high-dose mitragynine exposure. This also highlights the potential of CB1 receptor antagonism in ameliorating the cognitive deficits associated with long-term kratom/mitragynine consumption in humans."

Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) signaling diminishes with advancing age in specific brain regions that regulate learning and memory and abolishing CB1 receptor signaling accelerates cognitive aging in mice. We recently demonstrated that prolonged exposure to low dose (3 mg/kg/day) Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) improved the cognitive performances in old mice on par with young untreated mice. Here we investigated the potential influence of cannabidiol (CBD) on this THC effect, because preclinical and clinical studies indicate that the combination of THC and CBD often exhibits an enhanced therapeutic effect compared to THC alone. We first tested the effectiveness of a lower dose (1 mg/kg/day) THC, and then the efficacy of the combination of THC and CBD in 1:1 ratio, same as in the clinically approved medicine Sativex®. Our findings reveal that a 1 mg/kg/day THC dose still effectively improved spatial learning in aged mice. However, a 1:1 combination of THC and CBD failed to do so. The presence of CBD induced temporal changes in THC metabolism ensuing in a transient elevation of blood THC levels. However, as CBD metabolizes, the inhibitory effect on THC metabolism was alleviated, causing a rapid clearance of THC. Thus, the beneficial effects of THC seemed to wane off more swiftly in the presence of CBD, due to these metabolic effects. The findings indicate that THC-treatment alone is more efficient to improve spatial learning in aged mice than the 1:1 combination of THC and CBD."

      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most-used recreational drug worldwide, with a high prevalence of use among adolescents. In animal models, long-term adverse effects were reported following chronic adolescent exposure to the main psychotomimetic component of the plant, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). However, these studies investigated the effects of pure THC, without taking into account other cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant. Interestingly, cannabidiol (CBD) content seems to mitigate some of the side effects of THC, at least in adult animals. Thus, in female rats, we evaluated the long-term consequences of a co-administration of THC and CBD at a 3:1 ratio, chosen based on the analysis of recently confiscated illegal cannabis samples in Europe. CBD content is able to mitigate some of the long-term behavioral alterations induced by adolescent THC exposure as well as long-term changes in CB1 receptor and microglia activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We also investigated, for the first time, possible long-term effects of chronic administration of a THC/CBD combination reminiscent of \"light cannabis\" (CBD:THC in a 33:1 ratio; total THC 0.3%). Repeated administration of this CBD:THC combination has long-term adverse effects on cognition and leads to anhedonia. Concomitantly, it boosts Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase-67 (GAD67) levels in the PFC, suggesting a possible lasting effect on GABAergic neurotransmission.",

Yet as cannabis is legalized for medical and recreational use, there is interest in its therapeutic potential. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review summarizing the design and results of controlled trials using defined doses of THC and CBD in schizophrenia. Method: A keyword search of eight online literature databases identified 11 eligible reports. Results: One placebo controlled trial (13 stable patients without CUD) found that intravenous THC increased psychosis and worsened learning/recall. Two reports of a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study of smoked or oral THC in 12 abstinent patients with schizophrenia and CUD found no change in symptoms and cognition, and an amelioration of impaired resting state brain function in areas implicated in reward function and the default mode network. One 4 week trial in acutely psychotic inpatients without CUD (mean age 30 y) found 800 mg CBD to be similarly efficacious to amisupride in improving psychosis and cognition. Two 6 week studies of CBD augmentation of antipsychotics in stable outpatients reported mixed results: CBD 600 mg was not more effective than placebo; CBD 1,000 mg reduced symptoms in a sample that did not exclude cannabis use and CUD. A brain fMRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of single dose CBD in a sample that did not exclude CUD and cannabis use found that CBD improved symptoms and brain function during a learning/recall task and was associated with increased hippocampal glutamate. Discussion: There is substantial heterogeneity across studies in dose, method of drug delivery, length of treatment, patient age, whether patients with cannabis use/CUD were included or excluded, and whether patients were using antipsychotic medication. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence for an effect of THC or CBD on symptoms, cognition, and neuroimaging measures of brain function in schizophrenia. At this time, research does not support recommending medical cannabis (THC or CBD) for treating patients with schizophrenia. Further research should examine THC and CBD in schizophrenia with and without comorbid CUD and consider the role of CBD in mitigating symptom exacerbation from THC."

      "abstract": "High doses of the Cannabis constituent Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) increase the risk of psychosis in humans. Highly accessible animal models are needed to address underlying mechanisms. Using zebrafish with a conserved endocannabinoid system, this study investigates the acute effects of THC on adult zebrafish behavior and the mechanisms involved. A concentration-dependent THC-induced behavioral stereotypy akin to THC's effect in rats and the psychotropics phencyclidine and ketamine in zebrafish was established. Distinctive circular swimming during THC-exposure was measured using a novel analytical method that we developed, which detected an elevated Repetition Index (RI) compared to vehicle controls. This was reduced upon co-administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist NMDA, suggesting that THC exerts its effects via biochemical or neurobiological mechanisms associated with NMDA receptor antagonism. Co-treatment of γ-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol also showed signs of reducing the RI. Since THC-induced repetitive behavior remained in co-administrations with cannabinoid receptor 1 inverse agonist AM251, the phenotype may be cannabinoid receptor 1-independent. Conversely, the inverse cannabinoid receptor 2 agonist AM630 significantly reduced THC-induced behavioral stereotypy, indicating cannabinoid receptor 2 as a possible mediator. A significant reduction of the THC-RI was also observed by the antipsychotic sulpiride. Together, these findings highlight this model's potential for elucidating the mechanistic relationship between Cannabis and psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: There is widespread acceptance of cannabis for medical or recreational use across the society, including pregnant women. Concerningly, numerous studies find that the developing central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to the detrimental effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In contrast, almost nothing on the consequences of perinatal cannabidiol (CBD) exposure. In this study, we used mice to investigate the adult impact of perinatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE) with THC, CBD, or a 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD on behaviors. Furthermore, the lasting impact of PCE on fluoxetine sensitivity in the forced swim test (FST) was evaluated to probe neurochemical pathways interacting with the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Methods: Pregnant CD1 dams were injected subcutaneously daily with vehicle, 3 mg/kg THC, 3 mg/kg CBD, or 3 mg/kg THC +3 mg/kg CBD from gestational day 5 to postnatal day 10. Mass spectroscopic (MS) analyses were conducted to measure the THC and CBD brain levels in dams and their embryonic progenies. PCE adults were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests: open field arena, sucrose preference test, marble burying test, nestlet shredding test, and FST. Results: MS analysis found substantial levels of THC and CBD in embryonic brains. Our behavioral testing found that PCE females receiving THC or CBD buried significantly more marbles than control mice. Interestingly, PCE males receiving CBD or THC+CBD had significantly increased sucrose preference. While PCE with THC or CBD did not affect FST immobility, PCE with THC or CBD prevented fluoxetine from decreasing immobility in both males and females. Excitingly, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibition with a dose of URB597 that was behaviorally inactive in the FST rescued fluoxetine efficacy in PCE mice of both sexes. Conclusions: Our data suggest that PCE with either THC, CBD, or THC+CBD alters repetitive and hedonic behaviors in a phytocannabinoid and sex-dependent manner. In addition, PCE with THC or CBD prevents fluoxetine from enhancing coping behavior. The restoration of fluoxetine responsiveness in THC or CBD PCE adults by inhibition of FAAH suggests that PCE causes a lasting reduction of the ECS and that enhancement of anandamide signaling represents a potential treatment for behavioral deficits following PCE.",

Although the intensity of these activities is not the same for the individual cannabinoids it is comparable for all of them with that of E vitamin.

Gabapentin (GBP) synergizes with cannabinoid agonism in neuropathic pain models, substitutes for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in drug discrimination procedures, and reduced withdrawal symptoms in an outpatient clinical trial. However, there are limited data on the biological plausibility of the therapeutic action of gabapentinoids in cannabinoid withdrawal in preclinical models. The purpose of the current study was to determine the efficacy of GBP on attenuating THC withdrawal in mice, using an array of tests targeting withdrawal-induced and withdrawal-suppressed behaviors. Separate cohorts of male and female mice were administered THC (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle for 5.5 days, and withdrawal was precipitated by the CB1 antagonist rimonabant (2 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) on the sixth day. GBP (≥10 mg/kg) reduced somatic signs of withdrawal (i.e., paw tremors and head twitches), but had no effect in locomotor activity or conditioned place preference. GBP (50 mg/kg) also restored withdrawal-suppressed responding on a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule. However, GBP (50 mg/kg) had no effect in withdrawal-suppressed marble burying or tail suspension struggling and did not normalize the stress response induced by THC withdrawal, as indicated by plasma corticosterone. These data suggest gabapentin may be effective at treating cannabinoid withdrawal symptoms including somatic and affective symptoms but may act independently of endocrine stress activation.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a life-long disorder that often begins between the ages of 15 and 30. Anecdotal reports suggest cannabinoids may be an effective treatment. This study sought to determine whether home cage wheel running is an effective method to assess IBD, and whether Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, can restore wheel running depressed by IBD. Adolescent and adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were individually housed in a cage with a running wheel. Rats were injected with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) into the rectum to induce IBD-like symptoms. One day later, both vehicle and TNBS treated rats were injected with a low dose of THC (0.32 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle. Administration of TNBS depressed wheel running in adolescent and adult rats. No antinociceptive effect of THC was evident when administered 1 day after TNBS. In fact, administration of THC prolonged TNBS-induced depression of wheel running for over 5 days in adolescent and adult rats. These results show that home cage wheel running is depressed by TNBS-induced IBD, making it a useful tool to evaluate the behavioral consequences of IBD, and that administration of THC, instead of producing antinociception, exacerbates TNBS-induced IBD. PERSPECTIVE: This article advances research on inflammatory bowel disease in two important ways: 1) Home cage wheel running is a new and sensitive tool to assess the behavioral consequences of IBD in adolescent and adult rats; and 2) Administration of the cannabinoid THC exacerbates the negative behavioral effects of IBD.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause of dementia in the elderly population for which there is no cure at present. Deposits of neurotoxic plaques are found in the brains of patients which are composed of fibrils of the amyloid-β peptide. Molecules which can disrupt these fibrils have gained attention as potential therapeutic agents. Δ-tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC) is a cannabinoid, which can bind to the receptors in the brain, and has shown promise in reducing the fibril content in many experimental studies. In our present study, by employing all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the mechanism of the interaction of the THC molecules with the amyloid-β protofibrils. Our results show that the THC molecules disrupt the protofibril structure by binding strongly to them. The driving force for the binding was the hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic residues in the fibrils. As a result of these interactions, the tight packing of the hydrophobic core of the protofibrils was made loose, and salt bridges, which were important for stability were disrupted. Hydrogen bonds between the chains of the protofibrils which are important for stability were disrupted, as a result of which the β-sheet content was reduced. The destabilization of the protofibrils by the THC molecules leads to the conclusion that THC molecules may be considered for the therapy in treating Alzheimer's disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Daily use of marijuana is rising in adolescents, along with consumption of high potency marijuana products (high % Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC). These dual, related trends have opened gaps in understanding the long-term effects of daily consumption of a high dose of THC in adolescents and whether a therapeutic dose of cannabidiol (CBD) modulates THC effects. METHODS: Adolescent squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis) were treated daily for four months with vehicle (n = 4), a high THC dose (1 mg/kg i.m.; n = 4), or THC + CBD (1 mg/kg +3 mg/kg i.m.; n = 4), to investigate whether: (1) a daily high THC dose affects performance in tasks of cognition (repeated acquisition, discrimination reversal); (2) a daily high THC dose affects spontaneous behavior and day/night activity (3) tolerance develops to the behavioral effects of THC; (4) whether CBD modulates THC effects. RESULTS: THC impaired performance of adolescent monkeys in a cognitive test initially, but not performance on a task of cognitive flexibility. THC reduced motor activity and increased sedentary behavior, with tolerance developing after weeks of daily treatment. Co-administered with THC, CBD did not modulate THC effects on cognitive performance, activity or tolerance, but prevented THC-induced emesis on the first day of daily treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Daily high dosing with THC compromised performance on a task of cognition, and reduced activity in adolescent primates, with tolerance developing within weeks. Whether our observations are relevant to a broader range of cognitive tasks vital for daily function in human adolescents is uncertain.",

This systematic review characterised the acute effects of Δ9-THC on driving performance and driving-related cognitive skills, with a particular focus on the duration of Δ9-THC-induced impairment. Eighty publications and 1534 outcomes were reviewed. Several measures of driving performance and driving-related cognitive skills (e.g. lateral control, tracking, divided attention) demonstrated impairment in meta-analyses of \"peak\" Δ9-THC effects (p's<0.05). Multiple meta-regression analyses further found that regular cannabis users experianced less impairment than 'other' (mostly occasional) cannabis users (p = 0.003) and that the magnitude of oral (n = 243 effect estimates [EE]) and inhaled (n = 481 EEs) Δ9-THC-induced impairment depended on various factors (dose, post-treatment time interval, the performance domain (skill) assessed) in other cannabis users (p's<0.05). The latter model predicted that most driving-related cognitive skills would 'recover' (Hedges' g=-0.25) within ∼5-hs (and almost all within ∼7-hs) of inhaling 20 mg of Δ9-THC; oral Δ9-THC-induced impairment may take longer to subside. These results suggest individuals should wait at least 5 -hs following inhaled cannabis use before performing safety-sensitive tasks.",

METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted for eight weeks to determine the benefit of a THC-rich cannabis oil (24.44 mg/mL of THC and 0.51 mg/mL of cannabidiol [CBD]) on symptoms and quality of life of 17 women with fibromyalgia, residents of a neighborhood with a low socioeconomic profile and a high incidence of violence in the city of Florianopolis, Brazil. The initial dose was one drop (∼1.22 mg of THC and 0.02 mg of CBD) a day with subsequent increases according to symptoms. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was applied at pre- and postintervention moments and in five visits over eight weeks. RESULTS: There were no significant differences on baseline FIQ score between groups. However, after the intervention, the cannabis group presented a significant decrease in FIQ score in comparison with the placebo group (P = 0.005) and in comparison with cannabis group baseline score. (P < 0.001). Analyzing isolated items on the FIQ, the cannabis group presented significant improvement on the \"feel good,\" \"pain,\" \"do work,\" and \"fatigue\" scores. The placebo group presented significant improvement on the \"depression\" score after intervention. There were no intolerable adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Phytocannabinoids can be a low-cost and well-tolerated therapy to reduce symptoms and increase the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia. Future studies are still needed to assess long-term benefits, and studies with different varieties of cannabinoids associated with a washout period must be done to enhance our knowledge of cannabis action in this health condition.",

      "abstract": "Many people with MS (pwMS) use unregulated cannabis or cannabis products to treat the symptoms associated with the disease. In line with this, Sativex, a synthetic combination of cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) has been approved to treat symptoms of spasticity. In animals, CBD is effective in reducing the amounts of T-cell infiltrates in the spinal cord, suggesting CBD has anti-inflammatory properties. By doing this, CBD has shown to delay symptom onset in animal models of multiple sclerosis and slow disease progression. Importantly, combinations of CBD and Δ9-THC appear more effective in treating animal models of multiple sclerosis. While CBD reduces the amounts of cell infiltrates in the spinal cord, Δ9-THC reduces scores of spasticity. In human studies, the results are less encouraging and conflict with the findings in animals. Drugs which deliver a combination of Δ9-THC and CBD in a 1:1 ratio appear to be only moderately effective in reducing spasticity scores, but appear to be almost as effective as current front-line treatments and cause less severe side effects than other treatments, such as baclofen (a GABA-B receptor agonist) and tizanidine (an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist). The findings of the studies reviewed suggest that cannabinoids may help treat neuropathic pain in pwMS as an add-on therapy to already established pain treatments. It is important to note that treatment with cannabinoid compounds may cause significant cognitive dysfunction. Long term double-blind placebo studies are greatly needed to further our understanding of the role of cannabinoids in multiple sclerosis treatment.",

The cannabinoid drug delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is FDA approved for the treatment of anorexia and weight loss in people living with HIV. However, the effect of THC on BEV characteristics in the setting of HIV/SIV infection needs to be determined. Here, we used the SIV-infected rhesus macaque model of AIDS to evaluate the longitudinal effects of THC (THC/SIV) or vehicle (VEH/SIV) treatment in HIV/SIV infection on the properties of BEVs. While BEV concentrations increased longitudinally (pre-SIV (0), 30, and 150 days post-SIV infection (DPI)) in VEH/SIV macaques, the opposite trend was observed with THC/SIV macaques. SIV infection altered BEV membrane properties and cargo composition late in infection, since i) the electrostatic surface properties (zeta potential, ζ potential) showed that RM BEVs carried negative surface charge, but at 150 DPI, SIV infection significantly changed BEV ζ potential; ii) BEVs from the VEH/SIV group altered tetraspanin CD9 and CD81 levels compared to the THC/SIV group. Furthermore, VEH/SIV and THC/SIV BEVs mediated divergent changes in monocyte gene expression, morphometrics, signaling, and function. These include altered tetraspanin and integrin β1 expression; altered levels and distribution of polymerized actin, FAK/pY397 FAK, pERK1/2, cleaved caspase 3, proapoptotic Bid and truncated tBid; and altered adhesion of monocytes to collagen I. These data indicate that HIV/SIV infection and THC treatment result in the release of bioactive BEVs with potential to induce distinct structural adaptations and signaling cues to instruct divergent cellular responses to infection.",

Current treatments mainly target controlling symptoms and there are no therapeutics available in clinical practice to preventing the neurodegeneration or inducing neuronal repairing. Thus, the demand of novel research for the two disorders is imperative. This literature review aims to provide a collection of published work on PD and AD and current uses of endocannabinoid system (ECS) as a potential drug target for neurodegeneration. PD is frequently treated with L-DOPA and deep brain stimulation. Recent gene modification and remodelling techniques, such as CRISPR through human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, have shown promising strategy for personalised medicine. AD characterised by extracellular deposits of amyloid β-senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein commonly uses choline acetyltransferase enhancers as therapeutics. The ECS is currently being studied as PD and AD drug targets where overexpression of ECS receptors exerted neuroprotection against PD and reduced neuroinflammation in AD. The delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinoid (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) cannabinoids of plant Cannabis sativa have shown neuroprotection upon PD and AD animal models yet triggered toxic effects on patients when administered directly. Therefore, understanding the precise molecular cascade following cannabinoid treatment is suggested, focusing especially on gene expression to identify drug targets for preventing and repairing neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II/III trial aimed to evaluate an oral THC:CBD (tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol) cannabis extract for prevention of refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Here we report the phase II component results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients experienced CINV during moderate-to-high emetogenic intravenous chemotherapy despite guideline-consistent antiemetic prophylaxis. Study treatment consisted of one cycle of 1-4 self-titrated capsules of oral THC 2.5 mg/CBD 2.5 mg (TN-TC11M) three times daily, from days -1 to 5, and 1 cycle of matching placebo in a crossover design, then blinded patient preference for a third cycle. The primary end point was the proportion of participants with complete response during 0-120 h from chemotherapy. A total of 80 participants provided 80% power to detect a 20% absolute improvement with a two-sided P value of 0.1. RESULTS: A total of 81 participants were randomised; 72 completing two cycles were included in the efficacy analyses and 78 not withdrawing consent were included in safety analyses. Median age was 55 years (range 29-80 years); 78% were female. Complete response was improved with THC:CBD from 14% to 25% (relative risk 1.77, 90% confidence interval 1.12-2.79, P = 0.041), with similar effects on absence of emesis, use of rescue medications, absence of significant nausea, and summary scores for the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE). Thirty-one percent experienced moderate or severe cannabinoid-related adverse events such as sedation, dizziness, or disorientation, but 83% of participants preferred cannabis to placebo. No serious adverse events were attributed to THC:CBD. CONCLUSION: The addition of oral THC:CBD to standard antiemetics was associated with less nausea and vomiting but additional side-effects. Most participants preferred THC:CBD to placebo. Based on these promising results, we plan to recruit an additional 170 participants to complete accrual for the definitive, phase III, parallel group analysis.

      "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the effects of exposition to IC50 dose for 24 h of a new synthetic cannabinoid (CB83) and of phytocannabinoids Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) on HT-29 colorectal carcinoma cells. Cell viability and proliferative activity evaluated using the MTT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CyQUANT assays showed that cell viability was significantly affected when CB83, THC, and CBD were administered to cells. The results obtained showed that the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio was significantly reduced in the cells exposed to CBD and significantly increased in the cells treated with the CB83 when compared to the controls. CBD treatment causes a significant increase in malondialdehyde content. The catalase activity was significantly reduced in HT-29 cells after incubation with CB83, THC, and CBD. The activities of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase were significantly increased in cells exposed to THC and significantly decreased in those treated with CBD. The ascorbic acid content was significantly reduced in cells exposed to CB83, THC, and CBD. The ultrastructural investigation by TEM highlighted a significantly increased percentage of cells apoptotic and necrotic after CB83 exposition. The Annexin V-Propidium Iodide assay showed a significantly increased percentage of cells apoptotic after CB83 exposition and necrotic cells after CBD and THC exposition. Our results proved that only CBD induced oxidative stress in HT-29 colorectal carcinoma cells via CB receptor-independent mechanisms and that CB83 caused a mainly CB2 receptor-mediated antiproliferative effect comparable to 5-Fuorouracil, which is still the mainstay drug in protocols for colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "The use of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by inhalation using e-cigarette technology grows increasingly popular for medical and recreational purposes. This has led to development of e-cigarette based techniques to study the delivery of THC by inhalation in laboratory rodents. Inhaled THC reliably produces hypothermic and antinociceptive effects in rats, similar to effects of parenteral injection of THC. This study was conducted to determine the extent to which the hypothermic response depends on interactions with the CB1 receptor, using pharmacological antagonist (SR141716, AM-251) approaches. Groups of rats were implanted with radiotelemetry devices capable of reporting activity and body temperature, which were assessed after THC inhalation or injection. SR141716 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked or attenuated antinociceptive effects of acute THC inhalation in male and female rats. SR141716 was unable to block the initial hypothermia caused by THC inhalation, but temperature was restored to normal more quickly. Alterations in antagonist pre-treatment time, dose and the use of a rat strain with less sensitivity to THC-induced hypothermia did not change this pattern. Pre-treatment with SR141716 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked hypothermia induced by i.v. THC and reversed hypothermia when administered 45 or 90 min after THC (i.p.). SR141716 and AM-251 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) sped recovery from, but did not block, hypothermia caused by vapor THC in female rats made tolerant by prior repeated THC vapor inhalation. The CB2 antagonist AM-630, had no effect. These results suggest that hypothermia consequent to THC inhalation is induced by other mechanisms in addition to CB1 receptor activation.",

We present a case of a young veteran who presented with e-cigarette vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) to a primary care clinic and who required subsequent inpatient admission and home oxygen therapy after discharge. The patient afterwards improved after a three-month course of steroids and cessation of THC-containing electronic cigarettes, consistent with previously reported cases. Furthermore, evidence on bronchoscopy and biopsy demonstrated intracellular lipid droplets in the patient's macrophages. This outpatient case of EVALI prompts primary care providers to raise suspicion of this condition, and enquire about the use of e-cigarettes, particularly THC-containing vaping products. Furthermore, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, similar clinical and radiographic presentations between COVID-19 and EVALI can be seen."

There is increasing interest in the use of medicinal cannabinoids but little high-quality evidence to guide clinicians. This study aims to define the role of a 1:1 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) cannabinoid preparation in the management of symptom burden in patients with advanced cancer undergoing standard palliative care. METHODS AND DESIGN: One hundred fifty participants will be recruited from five sites within the Queensland Palliative Care Research Group (QPCRG) and randomly assigned to an active treatment or placebo group. This study is a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial of escalating doses of an oral 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation. It will compare efficacy and safety outcomes of a titrated dose (10 mg/10 mg/mL oral solution formulation, dose range 2.5 mg/2.5 mg-30 mg/30 mg/day) against placebo. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, using escalating doses of 1:1 THC/CBD or placebo, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief with tolerable side effects. This is then followed by a further 2-week assessment period on the stable dose determined in collaboration with clinicians. The primary objective is to assess the effect of escalating doses of a 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation against placebo on change in total symptom score, with secondary objectives including establishing a patient-determined effective dose, the change in total physical and emotional sores, global impression of change, anxiety and depression, opioid use, quality of life and adverse effects. DISCUSSION: This will be the first placebo-controlled clinical trial to rigorously evaluate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of 1:1 THC/CBD for symptom relief in advanced cancer patients. This study will allow the medical community to have some evidence to present to patients wishing to access cannabis for their symptoms caused by advanced malignancy.

      "abstract": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening complication that can ensue following Staphylococcus aureus infection. The enterotoxin produced by these bacteria (SEB) acts as a superantigen thereby activating a large proportion of T cells leading to cytokine storm and severe lung injury. Δ9Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive ingredient found in Cannabis sativa, has been shown to act as a potent anti-inflammatory agent. In the current study, we investigated the effect of THC treatment on SEB-induced ARDS in mice. While exposure to SEB resulted in acute mortality, treatment with THC led to 100% survival of mice. THC treatment significantly suppressed the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α. Additionally, THC elevated the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their associated cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-β. Moreover, THC caused induction of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). THC acted through CB2 receptor as pharmacological inhibitor of CB2 receptors blocked the anti-inflammatory effects. THC-treated mice showed significant alterations in the expression of miRNA (miRs) in the lung-infiltrated mononuclear cells (MNCs). Specifically, THC caused downregulation of let7a-5p which targeted SOCS1 and downregulation of miR-34-5p which caused increased expression of FoxP3, NOS1, and CSF1R. Together, these data suggested that THC-mediated alterations in miR expression in the lungs may play a critical role in the induction of immunosuppressive Tregs and MDSCs as well as suppression of cytokine storm leading to attenuation of SEB-mediated lung injury."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis availability with high concentrations of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and a range of THC to cannabidiol (CBD) ratios has increased in parallel with a rise in daily cannabis consumption by adolescents. Unanswered questions in adolescents include: 1) whether THC blood concentrations and THC metabolites remain stable or change with prolonged daily dosing, 2) whether CBD modulates THC pharmacokinetic properties and alters THC accumulation in brain, 3) whether blood THC levels reflect brain concentrations. METHODS: In adolescent squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis), we determined whether a four-month regimen of daily THC (1 mg/kg) or CBD (3 mg/kg) + THC (1 mg/kg) administration (IM) affects THC, THC metabolites, and CBD concentrations in blood or brain. RESULTS: Blood THC concentrations, THC metabolites and CBD remained stable during chronic treatment. 24 h after the final THC or CBD + THC injection, blood THC and CBD concentrations remained relatively high (THC: 6.0-11 ng/mL; CBD: 9.7-19 ng/mL). THC concentrations in cerebellum and occipital cortex were approximately twice those in blood 24 h after the last dose and did not significantly differ in subjects given THC or CBD + THC. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescent monkeys, blood levels of THC, its metabolites or CBD remain stable after daily dosing for four months. Our model suggests that any pharmacological interactions between CBD and THC are unlikely to result from CBD modulation of THC pharmacokinetics. Finally, detection of relatively high brain THC concentrations 24 h after the final dose of THC suggests that the prolonged actions of THC may contribute to persistent cognitive and psychomotor disruption after THC- or cannabis-induced euphoria wane."

      "abstract": "Chronic neuropathic pain (NP) is a growing clinical problem for which effective treatments, aside from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, are lacking. Cannabinoids are emerging as potentially promising agents to manage neuroimmune effects associated with nociception. In particular, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and their combination are being considered as therapeutic alternatives for treatment of NP. This study aimed to examine whether sex affects long-term outcomes on persistent mechanical hypersensitivity 7 weeks after ceasing cannabinoid administration. Clinically relevant low doses of THC, CBD, and a 1:1 combination of THC:CBD extracts, in medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, were orally gavaged for 14 consecutive days to age-matched groups of male and female sexually mature Sprague Dawley rats. Treatments commenced one day after surgically inducing a pro-nociceptive state using a peripheral sciatic nerve cuff. The analgesic efficacy of each phytocannabinoid was assessed relative to MCT oil using hind paw mechanical behavioural testing once a week for 9 weeks. In vivo intracellular electrophysiology was recorded at endpoint to characterize soma threshold changes in primary afferent sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) innervated by the affected sciatic nerve. The thymus, spleen, and DRG were collected post-sacrifice and analyzed for long-term effects on markers associated with T lymphocytes at the RNA level using qPCR. Administration of cannabinoids, particularly the 1:1 combination of THC, elicited a sustained mechanical anti-hypersensitive effect in males with persistent peripheral NP, which corresponded to beneficial changes in myelinated Aβ mechanoreceptive fibers. Specific immune cell markers associated with T cell differentiation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, previously implicated in repair processes, were differentially up-regulated by cannabinoids in males treated with cannabinoids, but not in females, warranting further investigation into sexual dimorphisms that may underlie treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis has been used to relieve the symptoms of disease for thousands of years. However, social and political biases have limited effective interrogation of the potential benefits of cannabis and polarised public opinion. Further, the medicinal and clinical utility of cannabis is limited by the psychotropic side effects of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC). Evidence is emerging for the therapeutic benefits of cannabis in the treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, with potential efficacy as an analgesic and antiemetic for the management of cancer-related pain and treatment-related nausea and vomiting, respectively. An increasing number of preclinical studies have established that ∆9-THC can inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancerous cells through the modulation of cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R), but clinical confirmation remains lacking. In parallel, the anti-cancer properties of non-THC cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), are linked to the modulation of non-CB1R/CB2R G-protein-coupled receptors, neurotransmitter receptors, and ligand-regulated transcription factors, which together modulate oncogenic signalling and redox homeostasis. Additional evidence has also demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of cannabinoids, and this may prove relevant in the context of peritumoural oedema and the tumour immune microenvironment. This review aims to document the emerging mechanisms of anti-cancer actions of non-THC cannabinoids."

We aimed to investigate the improvement of MS spasticity-related symptoms in a large cohort of patients with moderate to severe spasticity in daily clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MS patients with drug-resistant spasticity were recruited from 30 Italian MS centers. All patients were eligible for THC:CBD treatment according to the approved label: ≥ 18 years of age, at least moderate spasticity (MS spasticity numerical rating scale [NRS] score ≥ 4) and not responding to the common antispastic drugs. Patients were evaluated at baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks of treatment (T1) with the spasticity NRS scale and were also asked about meaningful improvements in 6 key spasticity-related symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 1615 enrolled patients, 1432 reached the end of the first month trial period (T1). Of these, 1010 patients (70.5%) reached a ≥ 20% NRS score reduction compared with baseline (initial responders; IR). We found that 627 (43.8% of 1432) patients showed an improvement in at least one spasticity-related symptom (SRSr group), 543 (86.6%) of them belonging to the IR group and 84 (13.4%) to the spasticity NRS non-responders group. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that the therapeutic benefit of cannabinoids may extend beyond spasticity, improving spasticity-related symptoms even in non-NRS responder patients.",

      "abstract": "Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. While the safety of THC and cannabis has been extrapolated from millennia of recreational use, medical marijuana programs have increased exposure among medically complex individuals with comorbid conditions and many co-prescribed medications. Thus, THC should be recognized as a pharmacologically complex compound with potential for drug-drug interactions and adverse drug events. This review summarizes potential adverse drug events related to THC when combined with other medications. Metabolic drug-drug interactions are primarily due to THC conversion by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, which can be impacted by several common medications. Further, CYP2C9 polymorphisms are highly prevalent in certain racial groups (up to 35% in Caucasians) and increase the bioavailability of THC. THC also has broad interactions with drug-metabolizing enzymes and can enhance adverse effects of other medications. Pharmacodynamic interactions include neurological effects, impact on the cardiovascular system, and risk of infection. General clinical recommendations for THC use include starting with low doses and titrating to desired effects. However, many interactions may be unavoidable, dose-limiting, or a barrier to THC-based therapy. Future work and research must establish sufficient data resources to capture medical marijuana use for such studies. Meanwhile, clinicians should balance the potential risks of THC and cannabis and the lack of strong evidence of efficacy in many conditions with patient desires for alternative therapy."

      "abstract": "Increased availability of cannabis and cannabinoid-containing products necessitates the need for an understanding of how these substances influence aging. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to different concentrations of THC (0.08, 0.4, 2 μM) during embryonic-larval development and the effects on aging were measured 30 months later and in the offspring of the exposed fish (F1 generation). Exposure to 0.08 μM THC resulted in increased male survival at 30 months of age. As the concentration of THC increased, this protective effect was lost. Treatment with the lowest concentration of THC also significantly increased egg production, while higher concentrations resulted in impaired fecundity. Treatment with the lowest dose of THC significantly reduced wet weight, the incidence of kyphosis, and the expression of several senescence and inflammatory markers (p16ink4ab, tnfα, il-1β, il-6, pparα and pparγ) in the liver, but not at higher doses indicating a biphasic or hormetic effect. Exposure to THC did not affect the age-related reductions in locomotor behavior. Within the F1 generation, many of these changes were not observed. However, the reduction in fecundity due to THC exposure was worse in the F1 generation because offspring whose parents received high dose of THC were completely unable to reproduce. Together, our results demonstrate that a developmental exposure to THC can cause significant effects on longevity and healthspan of zebrafish in a biphasic manner.",
