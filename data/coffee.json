      "abstract": "Introduction: Periodontitis is an infectious disease of periodontal tissue caused by the bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis which can trigger the formation of free radicals. Periodontitis can be treated using metronidazole but long-term use can cause negative effects. Natural ingredients such as robusta coffee husk can be used as an alternative treatment for periodontitis because of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial benefits. Aim: To determine the effect of robusta coffee husk extract on the number of fibroblasts and collagen density in gingival Wistar rats induced by P. gingivalis. Methods: Robusta coffee husk extract was extracted using the maceration process with 96% ethanol. Thirty male Wistar rats divided into 6 treatment groups: healthy rat, negative control (P. gingivalis + Aquades sterile), positive control (P. gingivalis + metronidazole), and 3 treatment groups of extract concentration (P. gingivalis + 125, 250, and 500 mg/kgBW). P. gingivalis injection was carried out in the buccal area of the left mandibular first molar of mice every 3 days. Robusta coffee husk extract and metronidazole were given by using sondase once a day for 21 days. The gingival specimens were then processed histologically. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was performed to observe the number of fibroblast, and collagen density was observed by Thricome Mallory. The SPSS application was used to examine the data calculation which included the Shapiro-Wilk, Levene, One-way ANOVA, and post hoc LSD tests. Result: Robusta coffee husk extract at doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg/kgBW showed increased fibroblasts and collagen density in Wistar rats induced by P. gingivalis. Conclusion: The most effective dose of robusta coffee husk extract is 250 mg/kgBW, with an average value of fibroblast number in a field of view is 37 cells, and the average of collagen density in the field of view is 163 pixels."

      "abstract": "The incorporation of bio-waste products into polymer materials as a fillers and colorants represents a highly significant approach for developing sustainable composites, aligning with the principles of a circular bioeconomy and contributing to reduced environmental impact. In this study, coffee grounds (CG) and black tea grounds (BTG), two mainstream food processing by-products, were employed as bio-fillers and pigments for ethylene-norbornene (EN) composites. The effects of hydrophobic treatment with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTS) on CG and BTG powders were compared to those of untreated bio-fillers with respect to dispersion, color characteristics, mechanical properties, and UV aging stability of the polymer composites subjected to 50, 100, 200 and 300 h of UV aging. Both the waste additives and the resulting composites were characterized through Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, tensile testing, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectrophotometric method. The obtained results demonstrated that the silanization of CG and BTG bio-fillers improved their dispersion within the EN matrix, consequently enhancing the UV aging resistance of the polymer composites. The EN/CG-APTS composite exhibited the best mechanical properties during the aging process, with the highest aging factor value of 0.6 after 300 h. On the other hand, the EN/BTG-APTS composite showed the smallest color change (ΔE = 7.8) after 300 h of aging. These findings indicate that improving the compatibility of bio-fillers with the polymer matrix can further increase their application potential in sustainable polymer materials technology."

      "abstract": "Coffee has become one of the most popular beverages worldwide due to the variety of bioactive compounds, which also play crucial roles against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little is known about how these defensive compounds are produced in coffee. Here, we found that the whole biosynthetic pathways and the production of caffeine and proanthocyanidins (PAs) were promoted under Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Co-expression data showed that some transcription factors were shared by caffeine and PA regulation, and further several candidate caffeine regulators were identified. The biosynthesis of monoterpene linalool was also triggered by MeJA, and the functions of coffee linalool synthase were characterized. Evolution and expression analyses revealed that the expression variation of linalool synthase is likely the major reason for the low linalool content in coffee leaves, despite of the linalool synthase expansion in coffee genome. Additionally, the JA signaling key regulator MYC2 could directly bind to and activate the promoter of linalool synthase to regulate linalool biosynthesis."

      "abstract": "Submerged fermentation offers a controlled environment for coffee processing, ensuring a consistent temperature and aerobic-anaerobic conditions, making it a superior alternative to solid-state fermentation. This study aimed to optimize submerged fermentation conditions for green coffee beans to maximize total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity, such as ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), and FRAP (the ferric reducing antioxidant power). Additionally, pH, yeast, and lactic acid bacteria counts were monitored. Fermentation was conducted with selective microbial starters, a varying temperature (25-35 °C), incubation time (3-9 days), and coffee weight (5-10 g) using a Box-Behnken design. To enhance bioactive compound infusion, fresh coffee cherries underwent ultrasonic treatment, increasing their porosity and water-holding capacity. Vacuum impregnation was then used to infuse fermented green coffee bean extract into the cherries. The lowest pH coincided with peak yeast growth, while the coffee weight significantly influenced all responses. The incubation time affected most parameters except DPPH activity, and the temperature impacted only ABTS and DPPH activities. Optimal conditions (35 °C; 7.21 days; 10 g) yielded a TPC of 480.25 µmol GAE/100 g with ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP activities of 725.71, 164.15 and 443.60 µmol TE/g, respectively. Ultrasound-treated coffee cherries exhibited increased porosity and absorption capacity, facilitating enhanced bioactive compound infusion during 3 h of vacuum impregnation. In conclusion, submerged fermentation effectively improves bioactive compound production, while ultrasound treatment and vacuum impregnation present promising methods for developing high-value dehydrated coffee cherry products."

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that include insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and abdominal obesity. Coffee production generates large quantities of waste products, which pose a serious threat to the environment. However, coffee by-products, such as coffee pulp (CP), possess an undeniable wealth of bioactive components. Based on this, we investigated whether a 10-week dietary intervention with 250 mg/kg/d of CP could prevent or ameliorate MetS in high-fructose-fed rats. Consumption of CP by rats fed a high-fructose diet reduced body weight gain, lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, and improved insulin resistance compared to rats fed a high-fructose diet alone. At the hepatic level, CP attenuated the increase in lipid storage, reduced lipid peroxidation, and improved glutathione levels when combined with a high-fructose diet. CP also affected the expression of key genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatic and adipose tissues, in rats fed a fructose-rich diet. This study demonstrates that CP ameliorates several consequences of high-fructose-induced MetS in the rat (weight gain, hypertension, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, changes in liver, and adipose tissue function). Hence, our data provide evidence that CP consumption in the context of a high-fructose diet can be used to improve MetS management."

      "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1) signaling plays an important part in maintenance of energy homeostasis, and CB1 blockers have shown promise in the treatment of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction. Coffee peel contains abundant phytochemicals and possesses hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study aimed to elucidate the preventive effect of coffee peel polyphenols (CPPs) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from the perspective of CB1 signaling. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet and CPPs (200/400 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Serum biochemical indexes and liver pathological analysis were used to evaluate the effect of CPPs on NAFLD. Untargeted/targeted lipidomics analyses were used to evaluate the levels of endocannabinoid ligands and ceramides in serum and liver. The expression levels of proteins were detected by using Western blotting analysis. Administration of CPPs significantly improved hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and biomarkers of liver function. Meanwhile, CPPs administration indicated reductions in endocannabinoid ligands, including anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels, associated with blockade of CB1 overexpression. Blockage of CB1 signaling depleted hepatic C16:0- and C18:0-ceramide concentrations by enhancing ceramide metabolism. The reductions in hepatic ceramide concentrations contributed to down-regulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and up-regulating proliferator activated receptor alpha, leading to decrease de novo lipogenesis and increase fatty acid β-oxidation in the liver, respectively. This study demonstrated a novel mechanism that CPPs could ameliorate NAFLD through modulating CB1-ceramide axis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although several studies have explored the effects of various caffeine dosages on balance, the impact of low-dose caffeine intake from Turkish coffee on postural control and hand-eye coordination remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects of Turkish coffee (60 mg/65 mL) on postural control and hand-eye coordination. DESIGN: This study was a quasi-experimental research with a one-group pretest-posttest design. SETTING: Cardiac Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Research Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: The study recruited 20 healthy young adults (13 females, 7 males) who were low habitual coffee consumers. INTERVENTION: The participants were given 65 mL of Turkish coffee for oral caffeine intake. OUTCOME MEASURES: Postural control was assessed using the Biodex Balance System, and hand-eye coordination was evaluated with the Alternate Hand-Wall Toss Test, before and after 30 minutes following coffee ingestion. RESULTS: The 'eyes open firm surface' condition of the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (P = .006) and the Alternate Hand-Wall Toss Test (P = .002) scores showed a statistically significant difference between the first and second measurements. No significant differences were observed in the postural stability and limits of stability parameters measured by the Biodex Balance System (P > .05). However, male participants exhibited better hand-eye coordination on the Alternate Hand-Wall Toss Test upon caffeine intake (P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: This study is likely the first to evaluate the acute effects of a cup of Turkish coffee (60 mg caffeine/65 mL) on postural control and hand-eye coordination. While no changes were found in balance conditions, improvement in postural sway on the firm surface with eyes open was noted. A significant improvement in hand-eye coordination was observed, warranting further research with objective tools."

The studies were carried out at two farms: IPACER (sandy clay Oxisol - OXIsc) and Glória (clay Oxisol - OXIcl). Evaluation factors included the application of indaziflam (75 g a.i. ha-1), different soil cover materials (crop debris, organic compost, and bare soil), and the evaluation period was from 30 to 180 d after application (DAA). The agronomic efficacy and residual effect were assessed by injury level, and the indaziflam's residual lifetime (RL50) was estimated using a first-order model. Phytosociological parameters, including absolute and relative frequency, density, abundance, and the importance value index, were evaluated. The results indicated that agronomic efficacy remained above 90% until 120 DAA in all treatments with indaziflam application, with RL50 exceeding 180 days. Weed indices were higher in areas without indaziflam, but treatment similarity analysis revealed that the weed community was primarily influenced by soil type, with a lesser impact from soil cover. Neither crop residues nor organic compost compromised indaziflam efficacy, indicating their suitability for coffee cultivation without the need to increase herbicide doses.",

Method: In this preliminary study we employed a Friendly Visitor program, in which a group of four women (27-33 years-old) with mild-to-moderate intellectual disabilities were visited weekly for three months by a group of visitors, forming an unstructured social group. Results: Following the meetings, improvements were found for the participants in several pragmatic skills (conversational competence, e.g., initiation, asking questions) and language production abilities (e.g., the number of two-word-utterances). Conclusions: Such effects may promote independence, reduce isolation, and increase integration and quality of life. Further studies with larger samples and more rigorous designs are needed to confirm these initial findings."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Urochloa decumbens intercropped with two coffee cultivars (Coffea arabica L.) on the levels of macro- and micronutrients and coffee crop yield. The experiment was conducted at Embrapa Cerrados, Planaltina-DF, and was arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replications, in a factorial design. The first factor consists of two management systems: with (WB) and without (NB) Urochloa decumbens intercropped; the second factor is composed of Arabica coffee cultivars 'IPR-103' and 'IPR-99'. There was no significant difference in yield of the coffee cultivars with and without Urochloa decumbens intercropped between the rows. The treatment with 'IPR-99' coffee cultivar intercropped with Urochloa decumbens achieved 400 kg ha-1 (8 bags) more than the other treatments. The presence of Urochloa decumbens increased leaf nutrient contents of the macronutrients Ca and Mg and micronutrients Mn and Fe. Thus, the Arabica coffee-Urochloa decumbens intercropping system is an efficiency management strategy which improves nutrient content for the main crop with consequent yield gains."

The present study aimed to evaluate performance-enhancement expectations for coffee and energy drinks using the Stanford Expectations of Treatment Scale. METHODS: A total of 402 participants (48.5% male) with an average exercise history of 4.53 years, engaging in average physical activity 3.91 times per week, were included in the study. Data collection was conducted through the Qualtrics platform. RESULTS: Participants exhibited significantly higher positive expectations for coffee compared to energy drinks (p = 0.002), whereas negative expectations were more pronounced for energy drinks than for coffee (p < 0.001). Males and individuals engaging in anaerobic exercise expressed more positive expectations for energy drinks than females and those participating in aerobic or mixed exercise regimens. Additionally, high-frequency exercisers (≥4 sessions per week) reported greater positive expectations for both beverages and fewer negative expectations for coffee than low-frequency exercisers (≤3 sessions per week). Correlational analyses revealed weak but significant associations between expectations and variables such as exercise history, frequency, intensity, and age. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that coffee is perceived as a more effective performance enhancer and exhibits greater placebo-inducing potential than energy drinks, which may elicit stronger nocebo effects. These group-specific perceptions should be considered by trainers, coaches, and researchers when addressing placebo-nocebo mechanisms in the context of sports and exercise.",

      "abstract": "The global consumption of coffee results in the disposal of vast amounts of spent coffee grounds (SCG), posing significant environmental challenges. Herein, we address this issue by developing an innovative, eco-friendly method to achieve superhydrophobicity using SCG. Repurposing this abundant biowaste, we developed a sustainable approach that avoids the use of harsh chemicals and energy-intensive processes typically associated with conventional methods. Our procedure involves wet ball milling of SCG in ethanol to produce microparticles, followed by electrospraying to create a micro-structured interface. A mild annealing treatment at 90 °C successfully transformed the SCG interface from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic, reaching a contact angle of approximately 151° and a rolling-off angle of 8°. The resultant interface exhibited remarkable self-cleaning properties, effectively repelling various liquids. XPS analysis revealed that the migration of fatty acids to the surface during annealing played a crucial role in lowering surface energy, thereby driving the hydrophilic-to-superhydrophobic transition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that solar-induced heating can effectively activate the same superhydrophobic properties, providing a practical and energy-efficient alternative to traditional thermal treatments. This method illustrates the role of light-activated fatty acid modulation in achieving superhydrophobicity and highlights the potential of SCG biowaste as a valuable resource for sustainable material applications."

      "abstract": "Coffee brew is an integral part of the individual diet worldwide. Roasted coffee contains numerous bioactive substances whose significance for health is investigated in nutritional studies. Food biomarkers are recommended to correlate coffee consumption and health effects in the most unbiased way possible. Metabolites of atractyligenin derivatives from roasted coffee have been suggested as candidate analytes indicating coffee consumption. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that atractyligenin (1), 2-O-β-D-glucosylatractyligenin and 3'-O-β-D-glucosyl-2'-O-isovaleryl-2-O-β-D-glucosylatractyligenin were extracted into coffee brew. Their concentrations in filtered and unfiltered coffee did not differ significantly, suggesting independence from the preparation method. In a coffee intervention study (n=12, female/male 6/6), atractyligenin metabolites were not detectable in plasma after three days of coffee abstinence. After coffee, atractyligenin (1) and atractyligenin-19-O-β-D-glucuronide (M1) were the quantitatively dominant atractyligenin metabolites in plasma and showed two peaks each after 0.5 and 10 h, respectively. Half-live of 1 after the first cmax in plasma was ∼0.31 h. 1 and M1 were detectable in plasma, indicating coffee consumption for up to 24 h after one serving. Within 10 h, ∼13.7% of the atractyligenin glycosides supplied by coffee brew were excreted in urine as the metabolites 1 and M1. Metabolites 2β‑hydroxy-15-oxoatractylan-4α-carboxy-19-O-β-D-glucuronide (M2) and 2β‑hydroxy-15-oxoatractylan-4α-carboxylic acid-2-O-β-D-glucuronide (M3) were detected in only some samples and appeared unreliable as indicators for coffee consumption. No concentration differences between female and male study participants were observed in plasma and urine. In conclusion atractyligenin and its 19-O-β-D-glucuronide are promising markers of Arabica coffee consumption in plasma and urine for both men and women, independent of the brewing method.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of regular coffee intake in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 infection, and to explore its possible mechanism of action using computer molecular docking technology. METHODS: We searched for relevant ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and China Biomedicine, Wanfang, CNKI, VIP databases to summarize studies on the effectiveness of coffee in preventing or treating COVID-19. The search period lasted until August 1, 2024. The 2 researchers screened the literature and data using Rev Man 5.4 software (the Cochrane Collaboration, 2020) for data analysis and used Schrodinger 2018-1 software to explore possible mechanisms of action. RESULTS: A total 5 studies with 39,290 participants were included. The results showed that compared with the control group that drank less or no coffee, the experimental group that drank more than 1 cup of coffee per day had significantly higher benefit rates (RD = 0.17, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 0.08-0.27, P = .0005), including lower infection rates and improved recovery rates from COVID-19 (RD = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.13-0.35), P < .0001). Molecular docking showed that CGA and caffeine present in coffee could combine with key amino acid residues of ACE2 or 3CL proteins to form hydrogen bonds. CONCLUSIONS: Regular consumption of coffee may have certain preventive or therapeutic effects on COVID-19, and the mechanism of action may be that CGA or/caffeine in coffee may be related to the formation of hydrogen bonds by key amino acid residues such as ARG273/HIE345 of ACE2 and CYS145 of 3CL. Owing to the limited number and quality of the included studies, the effect evaluation needs to be further confirmed using clinical randomized controlled trials. The exact mechanism of action requires further verification at the molecular level, both inside and outside cells.",

      "abstract": "The contamination of (waste)water with organic pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and dyes, is drastically increasing. Their removal process presents several difficulties, and often activated carbon (AC) is used in a filtration step. While commercial AC is often based on fossil resources, in this study, we present a new approach toward biochar from spent coffee (SC). This new AC has considerably enhanced surface areas and porosities, making it suitable for wastewater treatment. Using MgCO3 as an activating agent, a biochar with a significantly enhanced surface area of ∼600 m2/g is produced in a simple but efficient manner. The resulting biochar is effective for the removal of a whole spectrum of organic pollutants in aqueous systems. The dyes methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO), but also the pharmaceuticals diclofenac (DCF) and tetracycline (TET), as well as the xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA), are successfully removed by up to 100% from aqueous solutions with the new adsorbents. Removal efficiencies depend on the pH of the solutions. In contaminant mixtures, the biochar shows preferences for adsorption toward some compounds but still shows very high adsorption capacities for all contaminants."

Although traditional irrigants such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) are widely employed, they exhibit several limitations, including cytotoxicity and complete microbial eradication. In contrast, phytochemicals derived from plants, including coffee, present promising alternatives due to their established antimicrobial properties. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intracanal irrigants derived from locally cultivated Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (Robusta) varieties, both recognized for their antimicrobial attributes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 70 extracted human single-rooted teeth were prepared. Coffee extracts were prepared through a decoction method, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these extracts were determined using microbroth dilution assays. Microbial growth was quantitatively assessed at predetermined intervals. RESULTS: Green Robusta extracts exhibited antimicrobial effectiveness at lower concentrations of 25% and 12.5%. All coffee extract groups demonstrated substantial reductions in microbial counts compared to the negative control, with Robusta extracts proving particularly efficacious. Notably, the Robusta green 12.5% extract exhibited sustained antimicrobial efficacy, suggesting its potential as an alternative to NaOCl. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest a novel approach to improving endodontic therapy outcomes through the utilization of coffee extracts, potentially enhancing dental health."

Among 18 commercial enzymes to improve the accessibility of galactomannan, pectinase XL exhibited the highest yield, producing 235 mg hemicellulose/g of SCG. Pectinase treatment before mannanase resulted in coffee mannooligosaccharides (CMO) production 6.8 times higher than mannanase alone. This approach facilitated a 70% CMO extraction efficiency compared to the hemicellulose content present in the SCG. Additionally, HPLC analysis validated the composition of CMO, revealing 28.2% mannobiose (M2), 32.4% mannotriose (M3), 5.9% mannotetraose (M4), and 3.9% mannopentaose (M5). The CMO at different concentrations, along with fructose syrup, gelling agent, coffee extract, and coconut milk, was used to prepare jelly. CMO20 (20% CMO, w/w) jelly outperformed in both product stability and functional properties. The antioxidant activity of CMO20, measured by DPPH and FRAP assay, was 4.57 mM, with a Vit C equivalent and 15 mM FeSO4 equivalent, respectively. Furthermore, CMO20 showed 48% greater α-glucosidase inhibition than acarbose (5 mg/mL). CMO20 showed improved immunomodulatory effects with 4.7 and 16-fold higher nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-2 content than methotrexate-suppressed RAW264.7 cells.

In the present work, we extracted coffee peel soluble dietary fiber (CSDF) via ultrasound-assisted alcohol precipitation to reduce resource waste as well as environmental pollution and evaluate its structure, monosaccharide composition, and functional and physicochemical characters. Based on our findings, ultrasonic treatment decreased particle size of CSDF from 131.49 ± 7.67 μm to 75.84 ± 1.20 μm, and markedly improved the homogeneity. The ultrasonic power of 200-300 W resulted in increased thermal stability due to a higher crystallinity of the CSDF. Increasing the ultrasonic power (0-500 W) reduced rhamnose level from 8.25 % to 7.61 % (p < 0.05) and the SDF treated with 100 W of ultrasonic power had the highest fructose content (21.37 %). The ultrasonic treatment improved the water-solubility, oil-holding capacities and water-holding capacities of CSDF, with highest water-holding capacity being obtained at 300 W (8.92 ± 1.57 g/g). Additionally, the glucose and nitrite ion adsorption capacities significantly improved after ultrasonic modification. These findings may expand the application of CSDF in the food industry.",

However, the antibiofilm properties of SCGs against pathogenic bacteria have not been fully investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to highlight the inhibitory effects of SCG extract (SCGE) on biofilm formation in Listeria monocytogenes and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Treatment with SCGE disrupted both biofilm formation and architecture in L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, SCGE reduced autoaggregation and surface hydrophobicity. However, SCGE did not affect the viability of planktonic L. monocytogenes, suggesting that the decrease in biofilm formation was not attributed to decreased viability. Instead, SCGE downregulated motility- and adhesion-related genes in L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, SCGE impaired the swimming motility of L. monocytogenes. It also impaired adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, SCGE suppressed the production of autoinducer-2, indicating the inhibition of quorum sensing signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest that SCGE inhibits biofilm formation in L. monocytogenes by modulating quorum sensing signaling, which regulates bacterial motility and adhesion.",

      "abstract": "Global warming and extreme climate conditions caused by unsuitable temperature and humidity lead to coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix) diseases in coffee plantations. Coffee leaf rust is a severe problem that reduces productivity. Currently, pesticide spraying is considered the most effective solution for mitigating coffee leaf rust. However, the application of pesticide spray is still not efficient for most farmers worldwide. In these cases, pruning the most infected leaves with leaf rust at coffee plantations is important to help pesticide spraying to be more efficient by creating a more targeted, accessible treatment. Therefore, detecting coffee leaf rust is important to support the decision on pruning infected leaves. The dataset was acquired from a coffee farm in Majalengka Regency, Indonesia. Only images with clearly visible spots of coffee leaf rust were selected. Data collection was performed via two devices, a digital mirrorless camera and a phone camera, to diversify the dataset and test it with different datasets. The dataset, comprising a total of 2024 images, was divided into three sets with a ratio of 70% for training (1417 images), 20% for validation (405 images), and 10% for testing (202 images). Images with leaves infected by coffee leaf rust were labeled via LabelImg® with the label \"CLR\". All labeled images were used to train the YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 algorithms through the convolutional neural network (CNN). The trained model was tested with a test dataset, a digital mirrorless camera image dataset (100 images), a phone camera dataset (100 images), and real-time detection with a coffee leaf rust image dataset. After the model was trained, coffee leaf rust was detected in each frame. The mean average precision (mAP) and recall for the trained YOLOv5 model were 69% and 63.4%, respectively. For YOLOv8, the mAP and recall were approximately 70.2% and 65.9%, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the two trained models in detecting coffee leaf rust on trees, 202 original images were used for testing with the best-trained weight from each model. Compared to YOLOv5, YOLOv8 demonstrated superior accuracy in detecting coffee leaf rust. With a mAP of 73.2%, YOLOv8 outperformed YOLOv5, which achieved a mAP of 70.5%. An edge device was utilized to deploy real-time detection of CLR with the best-trained model. The detection was successfully executed with high confidence in detecting CLR. The system was further integrated into pruning solutions for Arabica coffee farms. A pruning device was designed using Autodesk Fusion 360® and fabricated for testing on a coffee plantation in Indonesia.",

METHODS: This was a triple-blind clinical trial study performed on 200 cases of randomly chosen women who had undergone cesarean section in both Akbarabadi and Firouzgar hospitals, and they were randomly divided into two groups. Those in the intervention group received 100 cc of coffee at 8, 1, 2, and 24 h after C/sec surgery, and the control group received 100 cc of warm water at the same time intervals. The bowel movements were then assessed and compared between the two groups. The gathered data were analyzed using an independent sample t-test and Chi-square test and SATA 15TH Ed. FINDINGS: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the two groups in their demographic and basic variants (P > 0.05). The mean difference between the two groups in terms of variants such as the timing of the bowel sounds restarted post-surgery, the timing of the first post-surgery gas passage, and the timing of the first post-surgery was significant (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in their hospitalization lengths (P = 0.10). CONCLUSION: Because of the effects of coffee on the improvement of bowel movements in the post-cesarean section, we recommend administering coffee to these patients."

Half of the students expected to be negatively treated (55%), mainly in terms of hierarchy and offensive language. The postclerkship response rate was 70% (n=101). Interest in a surgical career increased significantly from 21% to 50% (p<0.001). Thirteen students (13%) reported being negatively treated during their surgery clerkship, mainly in terms of poor supervision of their learning process and nonconstructive feedback. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Stereotypes of surgeons and the surgical clerkship are strongly prevalent among medical students. Half of the students enter the surgery clerkship with negative perceptions. Fortunately, the surgery clerkship debunked prejudices and increased interest in surgery. Poor supervision and feedback during the surgery clerkship were experienced as negative treatment, emphasizing the importance of cultivating a safe learning climate.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Phages were isolated from samples of coffee plant leaves collected at two different locations in Brazil. Both phages belong to the class Caudoviricetes and present myovirus-like morphotypes, and both exhibited specificity to their host, Pcg strain IBSBF-158. The two phages were encapsulated in chitosan-coated Ca-alginate nanoparticles, which demonstrated promising performance, promoting reductions in disease severity ranging from 66.83% to 83.37%, depending on the timing of application relative to infection. Both phages were somewhat susceptible to the effects of abiotic factors when in free form, with solar radiation seriously negatively impacting their lytic activity. However, nanoencapsulation of both phages as a lytic cocktail within chitosan-coated Ca-alginate nanoparticles proved successful in fully stabilizing both phages from the deleterious action of UV radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Application of such lytic nanoparticles in pre- and post-inoculated coffee seedlings in in planta greenhouse assays proved successful in controlling the phytopathogen responsible for BHB of coffee, Pcg, with a significant decrease in the progression of the disease. The results suggest that lytic nanoparticles may become an effective and sustainable strategy for coffee BHB control, as an alternative to conventional approaches relying on chemical (copper hydroxide or oxychloride or kasugamycin hydrochloride) or biological agents, but more studies are needed in the field to confirm this. The phage protection system developed represents a potential alternative treatment for bacterial plant diseases with minimum damage to the environment.",

Then, a high-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization was performed at 93 °C for 2 min as the control. Microbial analysis demonstrated that IEF treatment at 58 °C achieved a bactericidal effect. Both the IEF and HTST groups exhibited consistent trends in total sugar and total phenol content, showing approximately 28 μg GAE/mL after 28 days for IEF-2 group, compared to 25 μg/mL for HTST. Flavor analysis indicated that IEF group preserved the aroma characteristics during storage period. Further, IEF treatment effectively retained the key aroma compounds in cold brew coffee through GC-MS analysis, particularly pyrazine compounds with a relative content increased by 0.96 % in IEF-2 group after 28 days. Moreover, the bioactive compounds initially increased and subsequently decreased over the storage."

Whether and to what extent this is the case also in high risk cardiovascular patients such as those with elevated blood pressure (BP) is largely debated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data collected in 943 hypertensive patients belonging to the Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) study, which were classified as coffee consumers and non-consumers (self report). Cardiovascular and total mortality were evaluated at the 25 year follow-up taking into account a number of variables including office and 24-h ambulatory BP. When data were analyzed as unadjusted values no significant difference in hazard ratios for cardiovascular and total mortality was detected in coffee consumers and non-consumers considering office (0.85 and 0.83 respectively, PNS) or 24-h (1.08 vs 0.80 respectively, PNS) BP. This was the case also when the data were adjusted for confounders (age, sex, BP, lipid profile, plasma glucose and cholesterol levels, renal function, previous cardiovascular events) or when analyzed according to presence or absence of antihypertensive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Thus in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients chronic coffee consumption does not exert deleterious long-term effects on cardiovascular and total mortality. This is the case in both genders and in treated and untreated hypertensive patients.",

The extracted cellulose was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), x-ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), colour analysis, chemical composition, and particle size analysis. FTIR confirmed the removal of non-cellulosic components from coffee, which correlates with chemical composition and colour analysis results. The highest cellulose content (96.7 %) and the highest whiteness index (71.24) were obtained for the cellulose materials extracted using nitric acid-sodium chlorite and sodium chlorite with alkali pre-treatments, respectively. XRD data reveals that the treated coffee presented exhibited a higher crystallinity index compared to the untreated one. The highest increase in crystallinity index (from 54.9 % to 66.3 %) was achieved for the cellulose extracted using a 20 % hydrogen peroxide treatment with alkali pre-treatment. The maximum degradation temperature of the spent ground coffee increased from 292.0 to 310.5 °C after treatment with 10 wt% hydrogen peroxide and alkali pre-treatment. In summary, these findings highlight the great potential of spent ground coffee as a source of cellulose.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Published studies suggest that regular coffee consumption may reduce the risk of various diseases. However, many of these studies relied on questionnaire-based data, limiting their ability to identify the specific biological mechanisms behind the observed effects. This study focuses on controlled coffee consumption among healthy young adults to clarify its effects on erythrocyte properties. The functional condition of erythrocytes is important as it affects both macro- and microcirculation. Additionally, since erythrocytes are not true cells, they are particularly sensitive to biochemical and biophysical changes when exposed to biologically active substances. METHODS: After a washout period, 33 healthy young volunteers were asked to consume a standardized dose of a coffee beverage daily for 3 weeks. Basic hematological and body composition parameters were recorded before and after the intervention. Erythrocyte functional status was evaluated based on the following measurements: deformability, osmotic resistance, Na,K-ATPase activity, and nitric oxide production, along with monitoring oxidative stress markers. RESULTS: After a coffee consumption period, both erythrocyte count and hematocrit value increased, while body composition remained unchanged. Erythrocyte deformability improved across a range of shear stress values typical of human circulation. This improvement was accompanied with enhanced Na,K-ATPase activity in erythrocyte membranes in the wide range of sodium ion concentrations, as well as increased nitric oxide production by erythrocytes. Additionally, a higher GSH/GSSG ratio, indicating a shift towards a more favorable antioxidant balance, was observed in erythrocytes following the coffee intake period. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that controlled coffee intake in healthy young adults can positively influence various indices of erythrocyte functional status. Although the observed statistically significant changes were modest, the findings consistently indicate a positive modulation of erythrocyte properties-cell deformability, oxidative resilience, and active membrane transport of cations-following coffee consumption."

An in vitro Alzheimer's model was created with Aβ-induced toxicity in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT-22). Aβ(1-42)-exposed cells were treated with different concentrations of CDELNs (1-50 μg/ml) and the viability of cells was analyzed. The change in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) of cells was also determined. CDELNs treatment increased the viability of Aβ(1-42 )-toxicity-induced HT-22 cells significantly. The increase in the viability of Aβ(1-42)-toxicity-induced cells was correlated with an improvement in ΔΨm. CDELNs treatment restored the dissipated ΔΨm. These results suggested that CDELNs protect neuronal cells against Aβ(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity by repairing mitochondrial dysfunction. CDELNs might be a useful neuroprotective agent for the treatment or prevention of Aβ-induced AD. Further animal and clinical studies should be carried out to investigate the neuroprotective potential of CDELNs against Aβ-induced AD.",

This study investigated the impact of pretreatments, such as alkaline (NaOH), ultrasound, and static magnetic field, on SCG bioconversion in terms of biomolecule release, H2 potential and volatile fatty acids production. Following treatment, the slurry (solid and liquid fraction mixture) was utilised in anaerobic fermentation tests at varying volatile solid (VS) concentrations (23.3 and 46.7 g VS/L). The highest H2 production range, 25 - 30 mL H2/g VS, was obtained using the alkaline-pretreated SCG slurry at 23.3 g VS/L. Nevertheless, inhibition of H2 production was observed when utilising the alkaline-pretreated slurry at 46.7 g VS/L owing to the excessive use of NaOH for pretreatment and chemicals to adjust the initial pH. In contrast, increasing the VS concentration had a positive impact on volatile fatty acids accumulation, with acetic (HAc) and caproic acid being dominant. Ultrasound-pretreated SCG achieved 3260.0 mg HAceq/L at a concentration of 46.7 g VS/L.",

      "abstract": "A new technique has been developed to enhance the stability of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in the analysis of dry droplets by mitigating the coffee ring effect (CRE) on substrates with superhydrophobic microstructured grooves. The substrate was prepared from a laser-etched pure copper base, resembling the surface of a lotus leaf, creating a biomimetic superhydrophobic substrate. The superhydrophobic microstructured grooved substrate contained an array of dome-shaped cones with heights of approximately 140 μm and 100 μm, arranged in a periodic pattern of high-low-high. The superhydrophobic properties of the substrate not only evaporation-induced thermal capillary action but also initiated the Marangoni flow, which moves from the periphery to the center of the droplet as it evaporates. This flow mechanism effectively mitigated the CRE by transporting the analyte from the bottom edge of the droplet across its surface to the central peak. To assess how these superhydrophobic microstructured grooved substrates impede the formation of coffee rings, LIBS was deployed to analyze samples from both structured and unstructured grooved substrates. The results indicated that the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the spectral intensity for Sr I at 407.67 nm in substrates with a superhydrophobic microstructured groove edge length of 0.8 mm was 3.6%. In contrast, for the unstructured grooved substrate and a side length of 0.9 mm, the RSD was significantly higher at 25.4%. This research demonstrates that substrates with superhydrophobic microstructured grooves are capable of effectively mitigating the CRE. Additionally, the study examined how the dimensions of these grooves impact the plasma characteristics across two distinct configurations. Based on these observations, calibration curves for Sr were developed using substrates with groove side lengths of 0.6 mm and 0.8 mm. The performance of the superhydrophobic microstructured grooved substrate was satisfactory, exhibiting determination coefficients (R2) of 0.994 and 0.995 for the Sr element. The detection limits (LOD) were notably low at 0.16 μg mL-1 and 0.11 μg mL-1. The average relative standard deviations (ARSD) were 7.2% and 4.9%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the superhydrophobic microstructured grooved substrate effectively mitigates the CRE, thereby enhancing the detection sensitivity and prediction accuracy for heavy metals. This provides a robust reference for selecting platforms using LIBS technology in the pre-treatment process."

Investigating oxidative stress in women is crucial, as it is linked to insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Chlorogenic acid, a bioactive component found in green coffee, has numerous documented health benefits. This study aimed to assess the beneficial effects of green coffee consumption on paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in women with PCOS. METHODS: This study was a double-blind randomized clinical trial that included 44 patients with PCOS. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. For 6 weeks, the intervention group (n=22) received 400 mg of green coffee supplements, while the control group (n=22) received 400 mg of a starch-based placebo. Anthropometric indices, dietary assessments, and physical activity levels were evaluated before and after the 6-week intervention period. Additionally, blood samples were collected for laboratory analysis. RESULTS: Supplementation with green coffee increased PON-1 levels by 3.5 units, a significant finding (p=0.038). Additionally, the intake of green coffee supplements significantly reduced blood cholesterol levels by 18.8 units (p=0.013) and triglyceride levels by 6.1 units (p=0.053). However, no significant differences were observed in the levels of MDA, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, fasting blood sugar, insulin, or homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance as a result of the intervention. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with green coffee alters PON-1 activity and cholesterol levels in women with PCOS. However, it has no significant impact on MDA levels or glycemic status."

The Arabica coffee plant is susceptible to growing in many places across the world where temperatures are rising. This study examines how nanosilicon and seaweed extracts can improve Arabica coffee plant resilience during heat stress treatment (49.0 ± 0.3 °C) by maintaining mineral homeostasis and photosynthetic ability upon recovery. RESULTS: The principal component analysis arrangement of four treatments, nanosilicon (Si), seaweed extract (SWE), Si + SWE, and control (CT), showed each element ratio of magnesium, phosphorus, chloride, potassium, manganese, iron, copper, and zinc per silicon in ambient temperature and heat stress that found influenced upper shoot rather than basal shoot and root within 74.4% of largest feasible variance as first principal component. Magnesium and iron were clustered within the silicon group, with magnesium dominating and leading to a significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) in magnesium-to-silicon ratio in the upper shoot under heat conditions, especially in Si and Si + SWE treated plants (1.11 and 1.29 fold over SWE treated plant, respectively). The SWE and Si + SWE treated plants preserved chlorophyll content (15.01% and 28.67% over Si-treated plant, respectively) under heat stress, while the Si and Si + SWE treated plants restored photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) better than the SWE treated plant. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant of the Si + SWE treatment synergistically protected photosynthetic pigments and Fv/Fm by adjusting the magnesium-silicon homeostasis perspective in Arabica coffee to protect real-world agricultural practices and coffee cultivation under climate change scenarios.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ethiopia is one of the world's coffee producers, generating about 192,000 metric tonnes of coffee husks annually as by-products. The material can be used for ruminant diets to improve the nutrient utilisation of animals. However, coffee husk has toxic compounds, which can be minimised through different processing methods. Though the above techniques can minimise the toxicity level of coffee husk and increase the bioavailability of nutrients, there is scanty information on the comparative efficacy of these techniques, especially in ruminant nutrition. OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to examine the effect of processed coffee husk on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, body weight changes and profitability of Bonga rams based on natural pasture hay. METHODS: In the experiment, 24 rams were used, and the rams were grouped into six blocks based on initial body weight (mean BW 21.5 ± 1.01 kg). The rams were quarantined for 21 days, and each ram was randomly assigned to one of the experimental feed treatments in a randomised complete block design (RCBD). The experimental treatment feeds include 400 g conventional concentrate mix (CM) containing Noug seed cake and wheat bran (T1); 200 g boiled coffee husk + 200 g CM (T2); 200 g roasted coffee husk + 200 g CM (T3) and 200 g raw coffee husk + 200 g CM (T4). The CM was made in the ratio of 1:1. The data collected from the 90-day experimental period were: dry matter and nutrient intakes, initial body weight, final body weight and body weight changes. After the growth experiment, a 7-day digestibility trial was followed by collecting faeces using a harness bag. The data were managed using Microsoft (MS) Excel 2010 and analysed using R software (v. 4.3.2). The chemical compositions of the CM had maximum crude protein (22%), followed by boiled coffee husk (14.74%), which was higher than natural pasture hay (6.91%) and raw coffee husk (12.4%). RESULTS: The total dry matter intake (p < 0.05), metabolisable energy, and total nutrient intakes of rams were significantly (p < 0.001) maximised when rams fed on boiled coffee husk (T2) than raw (T4) and roasted (T4) coffee husk, except for NDF and organic matter intakes. The apparent digestibility of nutrients and feed conversion efficiency were maximised for rams assigned to T2. There was maximum daily body weight gain (p < 0.001) when rams were supplemented with boiled coffee husk (T2). Also, body weight changes of rams were significantly (p < 0.001) higher for rams supplementation with boiled coffee husk. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the boiled coffee husk as an alternative feed resource can be replaced by about half of the commercial CM without adverse effects of anti-nutritional factors and enhance the income of smallholder farmers in the coffee crop-livestock production system.",

While several pandemic intervention policies (PIPs) for tackling this rust pandemic are commercially available, they seem to provide only partial epidemiological relief for farmers. In this work, we develop a high-resolution spatiotemporal economical-epidemiological model, extending the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model, that captures the rust pandemic's spread in coffee tree farms and its associated economic impact. Through extensive simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly of small-size coffee farms and is the second-largest coffee producer in the world, our results show that it is economically impractical to sustain any profit without directly tackling the rust pandemic. Furthermore, even in the hypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm's epidemiological state and the weather in advance, any rust pandemic-related efforts can only amount to a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic case, any rust pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic losses, indicating that major disturbances in the coffee market are anticipated.",

The study excluded cross-over trials without washout period, those in critically ill patients, pregnant or breast-feeding women, multicomponent interventions and active control groups with tea or coffee. A random-effects network meta-analysis with a Bayesian framework was performed to calculate the mean difference (MD) and 95 % credible intervals (CrIs). The certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane tool. Twenty-two randomised controlled trials with 1710 participants (average intervention duration = 10 weeks) were included. Green tea was effective for weight loss compared with placebo (MD: −1·23 kg, 95 % CrI: −2·45, −0·02; low certainty evidence) or water (MD: −1·61 kg, 95 % CrI: −2·90, −0·35; very low certainty evidence), while other beverages (coffee, decaffeinated coffee, green coffee, black tea and sour tea) were not. Green tea was effective for weight loss compared with water in sensitivity analysis of healthy individuals (MD: −3·31 kg, 95 % CrI: −5·83, −1·04). Based on very low to low certainty evidence, green tea drinking may result in a small weight loss in adults. This study mainly focused on weight loss effects of green tea and coffee, with limited data on other teas. Only five trials had longer intervention durations, suggesting future research on long-term effects. Most trials had high bias risk and low certainty, requiring more high-quality trials."

      "abstract": "This research aimed to examine the effect of countercurrent ultrasound on extraction efficiency of cold brew coffee (CBC). The quality and flavor of CBC obtained by ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UE) were evaluated and compared with traditional extraction (TE). Meanwhile, the UE process was monitored in situ real-time using a near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer. The optimal UE parameters obtained by experiments were dual-frequency of 20/28 kHz, countercurrent ultrasonic treatment time of 50 min, ultrasonic power density of 320 W/L, and material-liquid ratio of 1:15. Under the optimal parameters, the total dissolved solids content (TDS) and extraction yield (EY) were 1.63 % and 20.52 %, respectively. This resulted in an 83.33 % improvement in efficiency matching the TDS and EY of a 5-h TE CBC. In comparison with the control, the contents of total polyphenols, total sugars, and total lipids after ultrasonic treatment increased by 13.79 %, 28.49 %, and 333.33 %, respectively, while the total acids content decreased by 27.81 %. HPLC and HS-SPME-GC/MS analysis showed similar non-volatile and volatile flavor components between UE and TE CBC. A quantitative partial least squares (PLS) prediction model was developed to monitor TDS and CGA levels during the UE CBC. This model demonstrated excellent calibration and prediction performance. (TDS: Rc = 0.9281; RMSECV = 0.0694; Rp = 0.9514; RMSEP = 0.0631. CGA: Rc = 0.9086; RMSECV = 0.0316; Rp = 0.9467; RMSEP = 0.0212). This study explored an efficient approach for the industrialization of CBC production and provided theoretical support for developing an intelligent control system for its process."

Cafestol, a bioactive compound in coffee, has demonstrated glucose-lowering and insulin-secretory properties in cell and animal studies. The acute effects of cafestol on glucose metabolism in humans have only been briefly investigated, and longer-term effects have not been explored. This study aimed to assess the effects of purified cafestol on insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters in healthy individuals with increased waist circumference at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Methods: A 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial was conducted with 40 participants. Insulin suppression tests, mixed meal tests, and MRI scans were performed before and after the intervention. Results: Administering 6 mg of cafestol twice daily did not alter insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance but led to significant reductions in body weight (2%), visceral fat volume (5%), and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (15%) compared to the placebo. Conclusions: Cafestol may hold promise for weight and visceral fat reduction. Cafestol did not improve insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance in this study but might still contribute to the observed inverse association between coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes. Future research should explore higher dosages and longer treatment durations, particularly in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Coffee drinking has been associated with benefits for various health outcomes, with many attributed to the most prevalent family of polyphenols within coffee, chlorogenic acids (CGA). Whilst reviews of the association between coffee and cognition exist, evidence exploring effects of coffee-specific CGA on cognition has yet to be systematically synthesised. The purpose was to systematically review the current literature investigating the relationship between CGA from coffee and cognitive performance. A further objective was to undertake a meta-analysis of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT). Observational and intervention studies were included if they considered coffee-based CGA consumption in human participants and applied a standardised measure of cognition. Furthermore, intervention studies were required to define the CGA content and include a control group/placebo. Studies were excluded if they examined CGA alone as an extract or supplement. A search of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and PsycINFO resulted in including twenty-three papers, six of which were interventions. The evidence from the broader systematic review suggests that CGA from coffee may need to be consumed chronically over a sustained period to produce cognitive benefits. However, the meta-analysis of RCT showed no benefits of coffee CGA intake on cognitive function (d = 0.00, 95% CI -0.05, 0.05). Overall, this review included a limited number of studies, the sample sizes were small, and a wide range of cognitive measures have been utilised. This indicates that further, good-quality interventions and RCT are required to systematically explore the conditions under which coffee CGA may provide benefits for cognitive outcomes.",

In vitro, we evaluated radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation, and the activity of digestive enzymes (α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and lipase). In vivo, we first examined coffee's effect on carbohydrate and lipid absorption in healthy rats, followed by a chronic evaluation of metabolic disorders and antioxidant markers using a diet-induced obesity model. In vitro results revealed that increased roasting degree reduced the antioxidant capacity of coffee brews. All brews showed lower inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase, and lipase inhibition compared to the positive control (acarbose or orlistat). In vivo, all roasting degrees consistently reduced postprandial glucose levels by 20%. Notably, coffee with a high roasting degree (HRD) decreased serum triglycerides (TG) by ∼44% after a lipid load, while other roasts did not. Chronic administration of unroasted (UN) or HRD coffee significantly reduced weight gain compared to the obese control (∼15% and ∼10%, respectively). Notably, all coffee samples improved lipid metabolism parameters. UN and HRD coffee significantly decreased adipocyte volume by 58% and 48%, respectively, compared to the obese control. Additionally, all groups exhibited less than 30% hepatic lipid droplets independent of roasting degree. HRD treatment notably increased liver catalase (CAT) activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in serum (∼90%), liver (∼59%), and adipose tissue (∼37%) compared to the obese control group. These findings suggest that HRD in coffee may confer certain biological advantages."

This study aimed to summarize the effects of GCBE consumption on SBP, DBP and HR in adults. METHODS: Data were pooled using a random-effects model and expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). RESULTS: Out of 1624 records, 10 studies that enrolled 563 participants were included. GCBE consumption significantly decreased SBP (WMD: -2.95 mmHg; 95 % CI: -4.27 to -1.62; p < 0.001) and DBP (WMD: -2.15 mmHg; 95 % CI: -2.59 to -1.72; p < 0.001). However, there was no significant effect on HR (WMD: -1.20 bpm; CI: -2.93 to 0.51; p = 0.170). Subgroup analysis showed that GCBE consumption had a more significant effect on SBP and DBP in participants with high SBP and DBP and had no effect on blood pressure in females. Linear and non-linear dose-response analyses were conducted to find the optimum GCBE dosage and duration of intervention. However, no significant associations were observed for SBP, DBP, and HR in linear meta-regression and non-linear dose-response based on the dose and duration of the intervention. CONCLUSION: GCBE has the potential as a hypertension-reducing supplement in hypertensive patients. However, GCBE did not significantly change HR.",

However, it remains unclear whether these interventions effectively improve symptoms of MD. Therefore, we conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the relationship between these dietary modifications and MD. METHODS: Summary statistics for salt added to food, alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, and MD were sourced from the United Kingdom Biobank, GSCAN, and the FinnGen study, involving up to 941,280 participants. The main analyses were performed using the random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach and were complemented by four additional methods. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the findings, and both forward and reverse MR analyses were employed to address potential reverse causality bias. RESULTS: The primary MR results using the IVW method revealed that salt added to food (OR = 0.719, 95% CI: 0.429-1.206; p = 0.211), alcohol consumption (OR = 0.834, 95% CI: 0.427-1.628; p = 0.595), and coffee consumption (OR = 0.852, 95% CI: 0.555-1.306; p = 0.461) were not significantly correlated with MD. In reverse analysis, no evidence of significant effect was found from MD to salt added to food (OR = 1.000, 95% CI: 0.993-1.007; p = 0.957), alcohol consumption (OR = 0.998, 95% CI: 0.987-1.008; p = 0.682), and coffee consumption (OR = 0.998, 95% CI: 0.985-1.011; p = 0.72). CONCLUSION: This MR analysis did not identify convincing evidence to support the idea that restricting salt, caffeine, and alcohol intake is beneficial for the treatment of MD."

      "abstract": "In the present study, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) was employed as a pretreatment method for the extraction of phenolic compounds from spent coffee grounds (SCGs). The impact of CAP treatment conditions, i.e., thickness of the SCGs layer (mm), distance between the plasma source and the SCGs layer (mm) and duration of CAP treatment (min), on the total phenol content, in vitro antioxidant activity, as well as caffeine and chlorogenic acid content of SCGs, was investigated. The process parameters were optimized with the aid of response surface methodology (RSM). After optimizing the CAP pretreatment conditions, the CAP-treated SCGs were subjected to ultrasound-assisted extraction using ethanol as the extraction solvent. The optimum conditions for CAP treatment identified, i.e., thickness, 1 mm; distance, 16 mm; and duration, 15 min, led to a significant enhancement in the recovery of bioactive compounds from SCGs compared to those obtained from untreated SCGs. Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity significantly increased (i.e., TPC from 19.0 ± 0.7 to 24.9 ± 1.4 mg GAE/100 g dry SCGs, ADPPH from 106.7 ± 5.01 to 112.3 ± 4.3 μmol Trolox/100 g dry SCGs, AABTS from 106.7 ± 5.01 to 197.6 ± 5.8 μmol Trolox/100 g dry SCGs, ACUPRAC from 17938 ± 157 to 18299 ± 615 μmol Trolox/100 g dry SCGs). A significant increase in caffeine content from 799.1 ± 65.1 mg to 1064 ± 25 mg/100 g dry SCGs and chlorogenic acid content from 79.7 ± 15.3 mg to 111.3 ± 3.3 mg/100 g dry SCGs, was also observed. Overall, CAP pre-treatment can be used to enhance the recovery of bioactive compounds from SCGs."

      "abstract": "Rising concerns over water scarcity, driven by industrialization and urbanization, necessitate the need for innovative solutions for wastewater treatment. This study focuses on developing an eco-friendly and cost-effective biochar-zeolite composite (BZC) adsorbent using waste materials-spent coffee ground biochar (CGB) and steel slag zeolite (SSZ). Initially, the biochar was prepared from spent coffee ground, and zeolite was prepared from steel slag; their co-pyrolysis resulted in novel adsorbent material. Later, the physicochemical characteristics of the BZC were examined, which showed irregular structure and well-defined pores. Dye removal studies were conducted, which indicate that BZC adsorption reach equilibrium in 2 h, exhibiting 95% removal efficiency compared to biochar (43.33%) and zeolite (74.58%). Moreover, the removal efficiencies of the novel BZC composite toward dyes methyl orange (MO) and crystal violet (CV) were found to be 97% and 99.53%, respectively. The kinetic studies performed with the dyes and phosphate with an adsorbent dosage of 0.5 g L-1 suggest a pseudo-second-order model. Additionally, the reusability study of BZC proves to be effective through multiple adsorption and regeneration cycles. Initially, the phosphate removal remains high but eventually decreases from 92% to 70% in the third regeneration cycle, highlighting the robustness of the BZC. In conclusion, this study introduces a promising, cost-effective novel BZC adsorbent derived from waste materials as a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment. Emphasizing efficiency, reusability, and potential contributions to environmentally conscious water treatment, the findings highlight the composite's significance in addressing key challenges for the removal of toxic pollutants from the aqueous solutions. PRACTITIONER POINTS: A novel biochar-zeolite composite (BZC) material has been synthesized. Excellent removal of dyes by BZC (~95%) was achieved as compared to their counterparts The kinetic studies performed suggest a pseudo-second-order model. BZC proves to be highly effective for multiple adsorption studies. Excellent reusability showed potential as a robust adsorbent.",

Malathion and chlorpyrifos, widely used as pesticides, pose significant health risks due to their neurotoxic effects and environmental persistence. Spent coffee grounds, abundant biowaste from coffee production, are chemically activated with KOH to enhance their adsorptive capacity without thermal treatment. This offers a sustainable solution for biowaste management and water remediation. Adsorption kinetics indicating rapid initial adsorption with high affinity were observed, particularly for chlorpyrifos. Isotherm studies confirmed favorable adsorption conditions, with higher maximum adsorption capacities for chlorpyrifos compared to malathion (15.0 ± 0.1 mg g-1 for malathion and 22.3 ± 0.1 mg g-1 for chlorpyrifos), highlighting its potential in mitigating water pollution. Thermodynamic analysis suggested the adsorption process was spontaneous but with the opposite behavior for the investigated pesticides. Malathion interacts with KACGs via dipole-dipole and dispersion forces, while chlorpyrifos through π-π stacking with aromatic groups. The reduction in neurotoxic risks associated with pesticide exposure is also shown, indicating that no more toxic products were formed during the remediation. This research contributes to sustainable development goals by repurposing biowaste and addressing water pollution challenges through innovative adsorbent materials."

Sixty participants with body mass index between 25 and 35 kg/m2 and a median age of 51.0 years (Interquartile range 46.3-56) were recruited. The study was a controlled, randomized, single-blind crossover trial consisting in drinking three cups/day of roasted coffee (RC) or lightly roasted coffee (LRC) during 12 weeks with 2-week wash-out stages before each coffee intervention. LRC contained ≈400 mg of hydroxycinnamic acids and ≈130 mg of caffeine per 200 mL/cup while RC contained ≈150 mg of hydroxycinnamic acids and ≈70 mg of caffeine per 200 mL/cup. Along the study, in each of the six visits, blood pressure, body composition by bioimpedance, anthropometric measurements, and blood biochemistry were analyzed. The mean differences and p values were calculated using a linear mixed model (JASP.v.0.18.0.3). A total of 38 participants completed the study. After the consumption of both coffees, fat mass and body fat percentage (LRC: -1.4%, p < 0.001; RC: -1.0%, p = 0.005) were reduced, whereas muscle mass and muscle mass percentage slightly increased (LRC: 0.8%, p < 0.001; RC: 0.7%, p = 0.002). The decrease in fat percentage was greater with LRC compared to RC (-0.8%; p = 0.029). There were no significant changes in metabolic syndrome variables or in body weight. In conclusion, LRC was slightly superior at inducing changes in body composition.",

Some clinical data have indicated the association between coffee consumption and decreased cancer risk. However, little data is available on the effect of coffee on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: In our study, we assessed the effect of Turkish coffee and Fridamycin-H on different pathways in breast cancer, including apoptosis, proliferation, and oxidative stress. A human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was treated for 48 h with either coffee extract (5% or 10 v/v) or Fridamycin-H (10 ng/ml). Ehrlich solid tumors were induced in mice for in vivo modeling of breast cancer. Mice with Ehrlich solid tumors were treated orally with coffee extract in drinking water at a final concentration (v/v) of either 3%, 5%, or 10% daily for 21 days. Protein expression levels of Caspase-8 were determined in both in vitro and in vivo models using ELISA assay. Moreover, P-glycoprotein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) protein expression levels were analyzed in the in vitro model. β-catenin protein expression was analyzed in tumor sections using immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA) serum levels were analyzed using colorimetry. RESULTS: Both coffee extract and Fridamycin-H significantly increased Caspase-8, P-glycoprotein, and PPAR-γ protein levels in MCF-7 cells. Consistently, all doses of in vivo coffee treatment induced a significant increase in Caspase-8 and necrotic zones and a significant decrease in β- catenin, MDA, tumor volume, tumor weight, and viable tumor cell density. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that coffee extract and Fridamycin-H warrant further exploration as potential therapies for breast cancer."

A response surface methodology (RSM) approach with central composite design (CCD) was employed to systematically investigate the effects of key process parameters, including adsorbent dosage, solution pH, contact time and temperature, on MB removal efficiency. The analysis revealed that adsorbent dosage and temperature as critical factors influencing MB removal, with a linear model providing a strong correlation. Optimal conditions for MB removal were determined to be 0.99 g of SCGB, 30 min of contact time, 30 °C temperature, and a solution pH of 7. Under these conditions, MB removal reached 99.99%, with a desirability of 1.000. The experimental results closely matched the predicted values, differing by only 0.02%, thus validating the accuracy of the model. Kinetic studies indicated a rapid adsorption process, well-described by both pseudo-first and pseudo-second order models. Isotherm analysis confirmed the applicability of the Freundlich model, suggesting favorable adsorption with increasing MB concentration. The high adsorption capacity of SCGB is attributed to its carbonaceous and porous structure, highlighting its potential as an effective adsorbent for dye removal in wastewater treatment applications.",

This study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of coffee pulp on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced glucose and lipid metabolism disorder in mice. METHODS: The type 2 diabetes (T2D) mouse model was established by feeding the C57BL/6 J mice with HFD. Mice were administered with coffee pulp diluted in drinking water before or after the establishment of the T2D mouse model. After treatment, the body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) of mice were monitored; the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) of mice was performed; plasma insulin was determined by ELISA; serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and liver TG were determined by biochemical analysis; hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to evaluate organ histomorphology. Gene expression of key genes in de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in the liver was examined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: Mice that consumed coffee pulp after modeling showed reduced FBG and liver TG, improved IPGTT, and alleviated fatty liver. Consuming coffee pulp before modeling prevented HFD-induced blood glucose and plasma TG increases. Mice consuming coffee pulp also had lower body fat and liver TG compared to the model group. qPCR results showed that the expression of transcription factors (Srebp1, PPARγ) and genes (Fasn, CideA, Plin3, Plin4, Plin5) related to DNL and lipid droplets (LD) formation in the liver of mice consuming coffee pulp were significantly lower than those of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that coffee pulp can attenuate HFD-induced disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism, and this effect may be related to the key pathways of lipid synthesis DNL and LD formation pathways in the liver."

In this study, spent Arabica and Columbian coffee wastes and their respective biochars were evaluated as soil amendments to improve the physical and hydrological properties of loamy sand soil and enhance maize (Zea mays L.) crop growth. Spent Arabica coffee (AC) and Columbian coffee (CC) wastes were collected and transformed into biochar through pyrolysis process at 550 °C with a residence time of 3 h and pyrolysis rate of 5 °C per minute. The AC and CC derived biochar were termed as ABC and CBC, respectively. The produced soil amendments were applied to soil at 0% (control), 1%, 3%, and 5% in a column setup. The moisture characteristics, including water infiltration, evaporation, and water retention, were investigated. Thereafter, the prepared amendments were applied to loamy sand soils at 0% (control), 1%, 3%, and 5% (w/w) application rates. Maize growth was then observed for a period of 30 days under greenhouse conditions. Results of the column trials showed that ABC and CBC applied at 5% reduced the cumulative water evaporation by 57%-66% and cumulative infiltration by 124%-181% compared to control. Likewise, 5% application of ABC and CBC resulted in 101 to 130% higher water retention in loamy sand soil. Results of the greenhouse experiment showed that 5% application of ABC and CBC amendments resulted in root biomass of 2.12 and 2.38 g, respectively, as compared to 0.51 g in control treatment. Similar treatments resulted in shoot biomass of 9.70 and 9.93 g respectively, as compared to 7.37 g in control. Likewise, 5% application of CBC and ABC increase plant height from 15.71 to 30.94 cm in ABC and 33.23 cm in CBC. Overall, 5% application of coffee waste-derived biochars significantly reduced water evaporation and infiltration, while increasing soil water retention and maize plant height, root biomass, and shoot biomass. Therefore, spent coffee waste-derived biochar could effectively be employed to improve physical and hydrological properties of loamy sand soils for better crop productivity.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine, the main psychoactive component in coffee, has garnered significant attention for its potential impact on the most prevalent mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. This chapter comprehensively examines the neurobiological effects of caffeine, its influence on anxiety and depression, and relevant clinical studies. Caffeine exerts its psychostimulant effects primarily through antagonizing adenosine receptors, modulating neurotransmitter systems, and influencing intracellular calcium signaling in the brain. Caffeine exhibits dose-dependent effects. While moderate caffeine consumption is safe in healthy adults and may offer benefits for mental health, excessive intake is linked to adverse effects on neurological and psychiatric health and can aggravate symptoms, highlighting the importance of adjusting consumption patterns. High caffeine intake correlates with elevated anxiety levels, especially in individuals predisposed to anxiety disorders. However, the relationship between caffeine consumption and the risk of depression is intricate, with some studies suggesting a potential protective effect of moderate intake, while others find no significant association. Individual variations in caffeine metabolism, sensitivity, and genetic factors considerably impact responses to caffeine. The chapter also explores the therapeutic potential of caffeine as an adjunct treatment and outlines challenges and future research directions in elucidating caffeine's multifaceted role in mental health.",

The application of elevated temperatures resulted in a reduction in the yield of hydrochars, whereas the incorporation of coffee grounds led to an increase in the yield. The blended hydrochar displays elevated ash, fixed carbon, and diminished H/C, O/C, and (O + N)/C ratios, indicating enhanced stability in soil treatment and potential for enhanced soil fertility. The application of hydrothermal carbonization facilitated the stabilization of heavy metals within the sewage sludge, with the stabilizing effect being enhanced by the addition of coffee grounds. Following the application of SCC as a soil conditioner to the heavy metal-contaminated soil for a period of 90 days, it was observed that the heavy metals Cu, Cr, and Ni present in the contaminated soil underwent a transition from an unstable to a stable speciation. Of the treatments tested, AK15 was identified as the most effective, demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of leaching and biotoxicity associated with Cu, Cr, and Ni in the contaminated soil.",

Its complexity, which is evident at the genetic and phenotypic levels, contributes to its diversity and resistance to treatment. Numerous scientific investigations on human and animal models demonstrate the potential of phytochemicals in cancer prevention. Coffee has been shown to possess potent anti-carcinogenic properties, and studies have documented the consumption of coffee as a beverage reduces the risk of cancer occurrence. The major secondary metabolites of coffee, named caffeine and chlorogenic acid, have been linked to anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic effects through various signaling. In light of this, this review article provides a comprehensive analysis based on studies in anticancer effects of coffee, chlorogenic acid, and caffeine published between 2010 and 2023, sourced from Scopus, Pubmed, and Google Scholar databases. We summarize recent advances and scientific evidence on the association of phytochemicals found in coffee with a special emphasis on their biological activities against cancer and their molecular mechanism deemed potential to be used as a novel therapeutic target for cancer prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Earlier laboratory-based evidence has suggested that polyphenol-rich, decaffeinated whole coffee cherry extract (CCE) supports improvements in acute and long-term cognitive performance. To better understand CCE's potential to promote cognitive processing, we conducted a first-of-its-kind remote clinical trial. Participants were randomized into one of two intervention arms: placebo or 200 mg CCE. At the beginning of the study, participants were asked to complete a set of acute cognitive challenges as part of the baseline assessment. Tasks were nearly identical to those used in previous, laboratory-based research. Acute results support that CCE outperformed placebo, reducing omissions and improving accuracy, during working memory and inhibitory control tasks. Long-term results indicate that CCE outperformed placebo on a measure of accuracy. This contributes to the literature in three ways: (1) results improve upon previously reported robust and consistent findings in a real-world setting that a single-dose of CCE acutely improved cognitive performance; (2) results replicate previous laboratory findings but in a real-world setting that long-term CCE supplementation outperformed placebo on measures of accuracy in a working memory task; and (3) it serves as proof of concept of a novel remote clinical trial model that may provide real-world evidence of efficacy while increasing accessibility and cohort diversity.",

      "abstract": "Consumer interest in plant-based milk alternatives is growing, despite extra charges in coffeehouses. While much research exists on non-dairy alternatives, plant-based milks in coffee drinks remain understudied. This study examines consumer preferences and behaviors regarding milk alternatives in coffee, using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW). A survey of 200 participants from 19 countries explored demographics, coffee habits, attitudes towards non-dairy milk charges, and marketing awareness. Market insights showed taste as the main reason for coffee choice, with a preference for cow's milk and local cafes for quality. Many opposed the extra charges for non-dairy options, citing lactose intolerance or allergies, especially among Gen Z and Millennials. Regional variations included stronger opposition in the UK and Germany compared to the UAE and USA. The marketing for non-dairy milk was less memorable than general coffee advertisements. Regression analysis confirmed that viewing non-dairy milk as a dietary staple increased consumption, aligning with the TDF's \"Beliefs about Consequences\" domain. Finally, within the BCW framework, the intervention strategies centered on training and coercion were discussed. Implementing these approaches could encourage the wider adoption of non-dairy milk options in coffee shops, fostering inclusivity, health awareness, and supporting environmental sustainability efforts."

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific disease that causes maternal symptoms such as high blood pressure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeO-E2), an endogenous metabolite of 17β-estradiol (E2) formed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), plays an important role in pregnancy. Our earlier studies have shown that polyphenols present in coffee can inhibit COMT activity, which may inhibit the formation of 2-MeO-E2 and contribute to PE. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the possible effect and mechanism of coffee intake during pregnancy on PE in rats. Coffee is administered with or without the co-treatment of 2-MeO-E2 to pregnant rats from the10th to the18th day of pregnancy. The results show that pregnant rats with coffee intake had prominent fetal growth restriction, hypertension, and proteinuria, which can be ameliorated by co-treatment of 2-MeO-E2. In addition, coffee treatment leads to significantly decreased serum 2-MeO-E2. Therefore, the PE symptoms induced by coffee treatment are probably mediated by decreased 2-MeO-E2. In sum, our findings provide a new mechanistic insight into how coffee intake could lead to increased risk of PE, and demonstrate the effectiveness of 2-MeO-E2 supplementation as a potential therapeutic agent for PE.",

This study investigated coffee consumption and liver-related survival in a large cohort of 455,870 individuals with UK biobank, categorized into without steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and MASLD and increased alcohol intake (MetALD). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjusted for confounding variables was used, followed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Moderate coffee consumption (1-2 cups per day) was associated with lower all-cause mortality across the entire cohort, without the steatosis, MASLD (p < 0.0001), and MetALD cohorts (p = 0.0047 for pre-IPTW, p = 0.027 for post-IPTW). Before IPTW adjustment, consuming one or more cups of coffee per day appeared to significantly reduce liver-related mortality in the overall (p = 0.015) and MASLD cohorts (p = 0.011). However, post-IPTW application, no significant differences in liver-related mortality were observed between the coffee intake groups (p = 0.778, 0.319, 0.564, 0.238 for each group). While increased coffee consumption initially seemed to reduce liver-related mortality, after IPTW adjustment, only all-cause mortality significantly decreased (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.027). These findings suggest that previous studies might have overestimated the favorable effect of coffee intake on chronic liver disease due to confounding factors.",

      "abstract": "The overuse of chemical fertilizers degrades the soil ecosystem and restricts the natural development of plants. Various byproducts are produced throughout the production and consumption of coffee within the coffee industry, and they are significant in terms of environmental waste. Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) contains various bioactive compounds that have demonstrated potential applications in various fields. These compounds can enhance soil quality by improving its physicochemical properties and biological fertility, ultimately leading to improved plant growth and reducing food waste and contamination at the same time. This current study examined the impact of chemical fertilizer, vermicompost, SCGs with percentage fertilizer (SCGPF), and SCGs on the top dressing fertilizer (SCGTDF) on red radish (Raphanus sativus) growth and soil quality. This greenhouse experiment tested various concentrations of SCGPF (5%, 10%, 25%, and 50%) and different doses of SCGTDF (0.5 g, 1 g, and 2.5 g). The results showed that the 0.5 g SCGTDF treatment yielded the highest mean plant length (18.47 cm) and fresh weight (27.54 g), while the vermicompost at a 50% concentration produced the highest mean leaf surface area (58.32 cm2). These findings suggest the potential of SCGs as a sustainable fertilizer alternative, contributing to improved plant growth and soil quality, thus supporting sustainable agricultural practices and a circular economy."

A set of nine Spent Coffee Ground Activated Carbon (SCG-AC) adsorbent samples were synthesized, by varying key parameters including pyrolysis temperature (400, 600 °C), pyrolysis duration (1 and 2 h), and the impregnation ratio of the activating agent, KOH (ranging from 0:1 to 2:1). Characterizations of these adsorbent samples were conducted by advanced analytical tools including SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, TGA, and BET. Furthermore, we carried out adsorption studies, exploring the effects of temperature and dosage variations. Additionally, point zero charge experiments and desorption studies were carried out to further understand the adsorption process. The outcomes of our investigation demonstrate the successful synthesis of these spent coffee ground-derived adsorbents, with a yield of up to 34%. Notably, these adsorbents exhibited high efficiency in extracting chromium (VI) from water, with removal efficiencies ranging from 75% to 100%. The adsorption isotherms revealed the Langmuir model to be the most fitting descriptor of the adsorption behavior. Moreover, a thermodynamics study revealed the process to be endothermic in nature which furthers our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Importantly, our cost assessment shows the economic advantage of the synthesized adsorbent over commercial counterparts such as zeolite, making it a competitive choice for real-world applications. In summation, the study not only introduces an innovative and sustainable utilization of spent coffee grounds but also delivers an in-depth exploration of the synthesized adsorbent's ability in chromium (VI) removal. Our holistic approach, encompassing thorough experimentation, characterization, and economic evaluation, solidifies the significance of this research in tackling environmental concerns and propelling advancements in wastewater treatment methodologies.",

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of coffee consumption on hunger, satiety, sensory specific desire (SSD), and dietary intake in women with overweight or obesity. METHODOLOGY: A randomized crossover clinical trial was realized in 3 sessions: in the first session a clinical history, anthropometric measurements and body composition analysis were performed; in sessions 2 and 3 the participants randomly consumed 240mL of coffee with 6mg/caffeine/kg of weight or 240mL of water along with a standardized breakfast. At fasting and every 30min after breakfast for the next 3h, appetite sensations and SSD were recorded using visual analog scales. Blood samples were taken at fasting, 30 and 180min after breakfast. Dietary intake was recorded in the rest of the intervention days. RESULTS: In the coffee intervention there was an increased desire for sweet foods, higher fructose intake during the rest of the day, and higher triglyceride levels than with the water intervention. No differences were detected in ghrelin or cholecystokinin. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee consumption may lead to higher triglycerides and higher intake of simple sugars, mainly fructose, through changes in the SSD.

The prepared NiFe2O4/SCG adsorbent exhibits remarkable magnetism with a strength of 45.78 emu/g and can easily be separated from water via a magnetic force. The adsorption of Hg(II) over the NiFe2O4/SCG has an optimal conditions of pH = 8, T = 39 ℃, and dosage of 0.055 g/L, and the maximal adsorption capacity for Hg(II) is 167.44 mg/g via Response Surface Methodology optimization. The removal of Hg(II) over NiFe2O4/SCG primarily involves ion exchange, electrostatic attraction, and chelation; conforms to the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir models; and is an endothermic reaction. Additionally, the magnetic biomass NiFe2O4/SCG has good regeneration capability and stability. The application research reveal that inorganic salt ions, nitrogen fertilizer urea, humus, and other contaminants in different actual water bodies (river water, lake water, and the effluent of sewage treatment plant) have little effect on the adsorption of Hg(II) over the NiFe2O4/SCG. The prepared adsorbent NiFe2O4/SCG has practical application value for removing Hg(II) from water bodies.",

      "abstract": "Manufacturing biodegradable lignocellulosic films from spent coffee grounds (SCG) as an alternative to commercial plastics is a viable solution to address plastic pollution. Here, the biodegradable lignocellulosic films from SCG were fabricated via a sequential alkaline treatment and ionic liquid-based dissolution process. The alkaline treatment process could swell the cell wall of SCG, change its carbohydrates and lignin contents, and enhance its solubility in ionic liquids. The prepared SCG films with different lignin contents exhibited outstanding UV blocking capability (42.07-99.99 % for UVB and 20.96-99.99 % for UVA) and light scattering properties, good surface hydrophobicity (water contact angle = 63.2°-88.7°), enhanced water vapor barrier property (2.28-6.79 × 10-12 g/m·s·Pa), and good thermal stability. Moreover, the SCG films exhibit excellent mechanical strength (50.10-81.56 MPa, tensile strength) and biodegradability (fully degraded within 30 days when buried in soil) compared to commercial plastic. The SCG films represent a promising alternative that can replace non-biodegradable plastics.",

Among those who participated in Survey 1 (2013-2014) and the follow-up survey (2015-2019), we selected 2605 participants for Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, 521 participants who were newly diagnosed with migraine and 2084 controls using a 1:4 incidence density sampling approach. Consuming coffee (≥ 3 cups: RR = 1.666; 95% CI = 1.175-2.362, < 3 cups: RR = 1.439; 95% CI = 1.053-1.966), being obese (BMI ≥ 25: RR = 1.341, 95% CI = 1.003-1.793), and engaging in vigorous physical activity (RR = 1.010; 95% CI = 1.000-1.019) increased the risk of developing a migraine. Nurses with an annual salary greater than $3500 were less likely to develop migraines (RR = 0.786, 95% CI = 0.631-0.979). The results imply that lifestyle factors, such as the amount of coffee consumption, BMI level, and degree of physical activity could be considered when formulating treatment plans for women who have newly developed migraines.",

Natural polymer coatings are usually applied to the paper surface to enhance the barriers to water vapour and improve the mechanical properties. A chitosan-based coating for paper packaging was developed in this work to store specialty roasted coffee beans, evaluating two samples of chitosan (Sigma® and molasses chitosan), and following the physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of coffee beans along a period of 60 days. Sensory tests (Ranking Descriptive Analysis and Preference Test) were applied to the beverage prepared with the roasted and ground coffee beans stored in each packaging. Thin chitosan films provided good coverage and adhesion on the paper. Improved mechanical properties and lower water permeability were observed in the chitosan-coated papers. The physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the coffee beans were not influenced by the packaging along 60 days of storage. The molasses chitosan coating resulted in slightly darker roasted beans. In sensory evaluation, there is a clear difference between the chitosan samples, so that molasses chitosan-coated packaging had higher scores compared to Sigma® chitosan treatment for flavor and global impression in the preference analysis of the beverage. The molasses chitosan-coated packaging had three to four more consumers attributing the highest scores for the beverage prepared with the roasted beans stored in this type of packaging.",

      "abstract": "Catalytic esterification of acid-rich coffee waste-derived bio-oil was performed using sulfonated metal oxide catalysts (Al2O3, MgO, ZrO2, and TiO2) and ethanol to produce fatty acid alkyl esters. The potential of the sulfonated catalysts for esterification decreased in the following order: Ti-SO4 > Zr-SO4 > Al-SO4 > Mg-SO4. Particularly, Ti-SO4 and Zr-SO4 resulted in 91.2 % (peak area %) and 85.2 % esters, respectively. This is attributed to the contributions of well-dispersed Brønsted acid sites created by -SO3H functional groups, additional Lewis acid sites formed by Ti and Zr oxides, and their appropriate pore size. Compared with HCl and H3PO4, the use of H2SO4 for TiO2 treatment significantly enhanced ester formation. When using Ti-SO4, increasing the catalyst-to-feedstock ratio (1/2 ∼ 1/10) significantly increased the esters' selectivity (38.7 %∼94.7 %). Ethanol utilization caused a superior selectivity for esters than methanol, while the increasing temperature favored ester production. This study proposes an eco-friendly and practical method for biodiesel generation.",

RESULTS: The 3 groups displayed similar age, gender, metabolic, and renal profile. Clinic and ambulatory BPs were similar in the 3 groups, this being the case for CAVI (0 cup: 9.1 ± 1.8, 1-2 cups: 9.5 ± 2.3, and ≥3 cups: 9.2 ± 2.1 m/s, P = NS). No significant gender difference in CAVI and in participants under antihypertensive treatment was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that chronic coffee consumption leaves unaffected arterial stiffness in the general population, this being the case in subgroups.

In this study, the peptides YGF, GMCC, and RMYRY were synthesized and tested in vitro for their α-glucosidase inhibition activity, complemented by in silico analyses. Two of the three peptides significantly inhibited α-glucosidase activity, with the more efficient peptides being YGF and GMCC (0.42 mg/mL), resulting in decreased enzymatic activity of 95.31% and 89.79%, respectively. These peptides exhibited binding free energies with the α-glucosidase complex of -8.5 and - 6.6 kcal/mol, respectively, through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with amino acids from the active site. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that YGF and GMCC profiles were unrelated to toxicity.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested a potential correlation between menopause and airflow limitation. However, the presence of protective factors in postmenopausal women remains uncertain. Therefore, our study seeks to examine potential protective factors associated with a reduced prevalence of airflow limitation among postmenopausal women. METHODS: Postmenopausal women were recruited from the Taiwan Biobank for this cross-sectional study. Airflow limitation was defined by a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <0.7. The participants were categorized into two groups: non-coffee drinkers and coffee drinkers, and the association between coffee consumption and airflow limitation was examined using binary logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 8149 women with available information were enrolled. Compared to the non-coffee drinkers, the coffee drinkers had a significantly lower prevalence of airflow limitation (7% vs. 5%). The odds ratio (OR) for airflow limitation was lower in the coffee drinkers than in the non-coffee drinkers (OR = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.63 to 0.94) after adjusting for confounding factors. We also examined the association between daily coffee consumption in cups and airflow limitation. The women who consumed ≥2 cups of coffee per day had an OR of 0.74 (95% CI = 0.59 to 0.94) compared to those who did not consume coffee. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that habitual coffee consumption is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of airflow limitation in postmenopausal women, warranting further prospective studies to explore possible causal effects and mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The industrial processing of pineapples generates a substantial quantity of by-products, including shell, crown, and core. Bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme found naturally in pineapple, including its by-products, may positively influence the bioaccessibility of phenolics from milk coffee. Therefore, this study aimed to assess how the inclusion of extracts from pineapple by-products, namely shell, crown and core, could impact the bioaccessibility of coffee phenolics when combined with milk. After measuring the proteolytic activity of pineapple by-products, the standardized in vitro digestion model of INFOGEST was employed to evaluate changes in total phenolic content, total antioxidant capacity, and individual phenolic compounds in different coffee formulations. The results showed that incorporating extracts from the crown or core in both black and milk coffee increased the bioaccessibility of total phenolics (from 93 to 114% to 105-129%) and antioxidants (from 54 to 56% to 84-87%), while this effect was not observed for the shell. Moreover, adding core extracts also enhanced the bioaccessibility of caffeoylquinic acids and gallic acid in milk coffee (from 0.72 to 0.85% and 109-155%, respectively). Overall, the findings of this study highlight that bromelain from pineapple core may have a favorable effect on the recovery of phenolic compounds in milk coffee, possibly due to its ability to cleave proteins. These outcomes point out that industrial by-products can be transformed into economic value by being reintroduced into the production process through suitable treatment instead of disposal.",

The pathophysiology of obesity is primarily attributed to lipid metabolism disorders. Conventional anti-obesity medications have a high abuse potential and frequently deliver insufficient efficacy and have negative side-effects. Hence, functional foods are regarded as effective alternatives to address obesity. Coffee, tea, and cocoa, three widely consumed beverages, have long been considered to have the potential to prevent obesity, and several studies have focused on their intrinsic molecular mechanisms in past few years. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which the bioactive ingredients in these three beverages counteract obesity from the aspects of adipogenesis, lipolysis, and energy expenditure (thermogenesis). The future prospects and challenges for coffee, tea, and cocoa as functional products for the treatment of obesity are also discussed, which can be pursued for future drug development and prevention strategies against obesity."

However, their utilization as a soil organic amendment is difficult due to their phytotoxic effect. In the present work, the impact of agronomic biofortification on Dutch cucumbers was studied by using different chemically modified SCGs, analyzing their effects on Zn content, the release of antioxidant capacity and the production of short-chain fatty acids after in vitro digestion-fermentation. The results indicated variations in the Zn content and chemical composition of cucumbers according to the treatment groups. The functionalized with Zn and activated SCGs were able to increase Zn levels in cucumbers. Meanwhile, the activated hydrochar obtained at 160 °C and the activated and functionalized with Zn SCGs showed the highest Zn supply per serving. Differences in the antioxidant capacity and short-chain fatty acid production were observed between the groups. It is concluded that the growing conditions and the presence of Zn may significantly influence the contribution of these cucumbers to the dietary intake of nutrients and antioxidants, which could have important implications for human health and nutrition."

      "abstract": "Coffee pulp is a by-product of the coffee industry. Due to conventional management techniques, it represents a severe environmental problem due to its negative impact on the soil (anaerobic fermentation and pH changes), water sources (the infiltration of pollutants into streams, acidification of water sources, and modification of microorganisms), and biodiversity (soil microbiology, fish, crustaceans, and other vertebrates). Therefore, it is essential to develop protocols for the treatment of this waste so that it can be used again in other productive activities under the circular economy approach. This means that all the waste from a production process can be reused, can generate value for the benefit of the producer, and, in turn, mitigate the environmental impact. The objective of this study was to evaluate the replacement of 5 levels of wheat bran (WB) with extruded coffee pulp flour (ECPF) as an alternative to a conventional fiber source in broiler finisher diets. A total of 300 Cobb 500 chickens in the finishing phase were assessed in the study, grouped in 5 treatments: T1, a conventional diet or control treatment (100% WB and 0% ECPF), T2 (75% WB and 25% ECPF), T3 (50% WB and 50% ECPF), T4 (25% WB and 75% ECPF), and T5 (0% WB and 100% ECPF). Feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and intestinal morphometry (villus length: VL, villus width: VW, crypt depth: CD, villus height/crypt depth ratio: V/C, and villus surface area: VSA) were evaluated at the level of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Feed intake decreased correspondingly as the ECPF in the diet was increased, with statistical differences (p < 0.01) between their averages; the most significant weight gain (834.61 g) was evidenced with the T2 treatment, this being statistically different (p < 0.01) from T4 and T5; similarly, the best FCR (1.58) was evidenced with the T2 treatment, followed by the control treatment T1 (with 1.64); however, they were not statistically different (p > 0.05). All treatment results were similar to the VL control samples in the three intestinal portions, except for the T5 in the jejunum, which showed statistical differences from the control. In VW, the treatment results were similar to the control samples of the jejunum and ileum; however, in the duodenum, the T5 results showed the highest value (172.18 μm), being statistically different (p < 0.05) from the other treatments being evaluated. For CD, it was only in the duodenum that the T2 and T3 treatments were similar to the control. Likewise, for V/C in the duodenum, only the T2 results were similar to the control. There was no significant difference in the VSA among the different treatment groups. T2 showed better production parameters without altering the intestinal villi. In conclusion, ECPF is a potential input for use to replace up to 25% of WB in the feed of broilers in the finishing phase."

      "abstract": "Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are a type of food waste and are produced in abundance around the world. However, their utilization as a soil organic amendment is challenging due to their phytotoxic effect. In the present work, the impact of agronomic biofortification on Dutch cucumbers was investigated using different chemically modified SCG and analyzing their effects on iron contents, their capacity for releasing antioxidants, and the production of short-chain fatty acids after in vitro digestion-fermentation. The results indicated variations in the iron contents and chemical compositions of cucumbers according to the treatment groups. Functionalized and activated hydrochar from SCG increased Fe levels in cucumbers. Although activated hydrochar obtained at 160 °C and functionalized with Fe showed the highest iron supply per serving, differences in antioxidant capacity and short-chain fatty acid production were observed between the groups. It is concluded that growing conditions and the presence of iron may significantly influence the contribution of these cucumbers to the dietary intake of nutrients and antioxidants, which could have important implications for human health and nutrition."

Specifically, no data are available on the longitudinal association between habitual coffee consumption and office, home and 24 h BP profile and variability. METHODS: In 1408 subjects recruited in the Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) study, followed for a 10 year follow-up period and classified as coffee consumers and nonconsumers (self-reporting), we prospectically investigated the association between habitual coffee consumption and office, home and 24-h ambulatory BP; 24-h BP variability; and development of a new hypertensive state. Data were also analysed according to gender. RESULTS: When data were adjusted for confounders habitual coffee nonconsumers and consumers displayed similar long-term BP changes during the follow-up in office, home, and ambulatory BP. No difference was found between heavy and moderate coffee consumers. Furthermore, also new-onset hypertension and patterns of BP variability were superimposable in coffee nonconsumers and consumers, independently on confounders including gender, number, and characteristics of the antihypertensive drug treatment. CONCLUSION: The present study, which is the first longitudinal investigation never performed examining in a prospective fashion the long-term (10 year) effects of coffee consumption on office, home, and ambulatory BP, provides conclusive evidence that habitual coffee consumption is associated with neutral effects on in-office and out-of-office BP values and related variabilities. This is the also the case for the new-onset hypertensive state.",

This study compared methane production using different compositions of cattle manure (CM) and granular sludge from an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor used in poultry wastewater treatment (GS). Four anaerobic batch reactors (500 mL) were assembled, A (50% CM and 50% GS), B (60% CM and 40% GS), C (70% CM and 30% of GS) and D (60% CM and 40% GS). Equal concentrations of substrates were added to all reactors: pulp and husk pretreated by hydrothermolysis (1 g L-1), coffee (10 g COD L-1) and brewery (1.5 g COD L-1) wastewaters. Assays A, B and C were supplemented with 2 g L-1 of yeast extract, except for assay D. The reactors were operated at 37 °C and pH 7.0. In assay B, the highest CH4 production of 759.15 ± 19.20 mL CH4 g-1 TS was observed, possibly favored by the synergistic interactions between cellulolytic bacteria Christensenellaceae_R-7_group and Methanosaeta archaea, as inferred by genes encoding enzymes related to acetoclastic methanogenesis (acetyl-CoA synthetase). Consequently, the electricity production potential of assay B (45614.08 kWh-1 year-1) could meet the energy demand of a farm producing coffee and beer, contributing to a positive energy balance concerning methane generation.",

The aim is to assess the impact of varying SCG concentrations (1 %, 3 %, 5 %, and 7 %) on the functional, thermal, mechanical properties and biodegradability of the resulting composites with a PHBV matrix. The samples were produced through melt compounding using a twin-screw extruder and compression molding. The findings indicate successful dispersion and distribution of SCGs microfiller into PHBV. Chemical treatment of SCG microfiller enhanced the interfacial bonding between the SCG and PHBV, evidenced by higher water contact angles of the biopolymer composites. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) confirmed the successful interaction of treated SCG microfiller, contributing to enhanced mechanical characteristics. A two-way ANOVA was conducted for statistical analysis. Mass losses observed after burying the materials in natural soil indicated that the composites degraded faster than the pure PHBV polymer suggesting that both composites are biodegradable, particularly at high levels of spent coffee grounds (SCG). Despite the possibility of agglomeration at higher concentrations, SCG incorporation resulted in improved functional properties, positioning the green biopolymer composite as a promising material for sustainable packaging and diverse applications.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: This research aims to predict the presence of marker compounds that differentiate tubruk brew from coffee beans with different postharvest processing. This research also aims to predict compounds correlating with antioxidant activity and sensory flavour attributes. This research used Kalosi-Enrekang Arabica coffee beans, which were processed with three different postharvest processing (honey, full-washed and natural), roasted at medium level, and brewed using the tubruk method. Each brew was analyzed for chemical profiles using LC-MS and GC-MS, antioxidant analysis using the DPPH IC50 and FRAP methods, and sensory analysis for flavour using the QDA and SCAA methods for cupping scores. OPLS-DA analysis revealed the presence of marker compounds from each brew, and the dried fruit flavour attribute was to be an inter-process marker. After that, OPLS analysis showed marker compounds that correlate to antioxidant activity and flavour attributes. Rhaponticin is thought to be one of the marker compounds in natural coffee brews and is one of the compounds that correlates to the antioxidant activity of the DPPH method (IC50); prunin is thought to be one of the marker compounds for full-washed coffee brews and is one of the compounds that correlates to the activity antioxidants of FRAP method. Triacetin, which is thought to be a marker compound in natural brewed coffee, correlates with fruity flavour. 3-acetylpyridine, as a marker in honey-brewed coffee, correlates with nutty flavour. Even though there are differences in dominant flavours, the cupping score shows the brew is categorized as a specialty. This research shows that different post-harvest processing processes influence the compound profile, antioxidant activity and flavour attributes of Tubruk brewed coffee.

In response, this study investigates the potential of utilizing natural coagulants, Acanthus sennii C., Moringa stenopetala B., and Aloe vera L., either individually or in combination, for the treatment of coffee effluent. Methodologically, the study systematically varies operational parameters, including coagulant dose, pH levels, stirring speed, and stirring time, to evaluate their impact on coagulation efficiency. Experimental data undergo statistical analysis, employing ANOVA, while computational optimization techniques are employed using Design Expert software to determine optimal conditions. Notably, the blended form of the three coagulants emerges as particularly promising, yielding optimal conditions of 0.750 g/L coagulant dosage, pH 8.76, agitation speed of 80.73 rpm, and agitation time of 19.23 min. Under these optimized conditions, the blended coagulant achieves remarkable removal efficiencies, approximately 99.99% for color and 98.7% for turbidity. These findings underscore the efficiency of natural coagulants, particularly in blended form, for sustainable wastewater treatment in wet coffee processing."

The results indicated that tensile properties reduction could be due to its incompatibility with the PHB/PLA matrixSCG aggregation at 40 wt% content resulted in higher void formation compared to lower content at 10 wt%. A PHB/PLA ratio of 50/50 with SCG loading 20 wt% was chosen for biocomposites with treated SCG. Biological treatment of SCG using Phanerochaete chrysosporium CK01 and Aspergillus niger DWA8 indicated P. chrysosporium CK01 necessitated a higher moisture content for optimum growth and enzyme production, whereas the optimal conditions for enzyme production (50-55 %, w/w) differed from those promoting A. niger DWA8 growth (40 %, w/w).

This study focused on the production of green functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and using them in the adsorption of the pharmaceuticals Losartan (LOS) and Diclofenac (DIC). The efficiency of the methodology was verified by characterization techniques. Elemental composition analysis indicated a significant increase in the iron content after the green functionalization, proving the effectiveness of the method. Thermogravimetric analysis showed similar thermal degradation profiles for pristine CNTs and functionalized CNTs, indicating better post-functionalization thermal stability. BET analysis revealed mesoporous characteristics of CNTs, with increased surface area and pore volumes after functionalization. X-Ray diffraction confirmed the preservation of the lattice structure of the CNTs post-functionalization and post-adsorption, with changes in peak broadening suggesting surface modifications. LOS and DIC adsorption were evaluated via kinetic studies at four different concentrations (0.1-0.4 mmol/L) that were best represented by the pseudo-second order model, suggesting chemisorption mechanisms, with faster and higher uptakes for DIC (0.084-0.261 mmol/g; teq = 5 min) when compared to LOS (0.058-0.235 mmol/g; teq = 20 min). The curves were also studied via artificial neural networks (ANN) and revealed that the best ANN architecture for representing the experimental data is a network with [3 5 5 2] neurons trained using the Bayesian-Regularization algorithm and the Log-sigmoid (hidden layers) and Linear (output layer) transfer functions. The desorption study showed that CaCl2 had better performance in CNT regeneration, reaching its removal capacity above 50% up to 3 cycles, for both pharmaceuticals. These findings reveal the potential of the developed material as a promising adsorbent for targeted removal of pollutants, contributing to advances in the remediation of emerging contaminants and the application of artificial intelligence in adsorption research.",

The porous starch samples were obtained using enzymatic treatment and its potential to retain aroma compounds from coffee extract was evaluated. The physicochemical properties, structure characteristics, porosity characteristics and adsorption quantity of starches were also determined. The retention of coffee aroma compounds was investigated through combining starch or porous starch with odorants, and storing the mixtures at room temperature for 7 and 14 days, respectively. The chemical properties of aroma compounds as well as starch surface properties were observed to affect the retention of aroma compounds upon storage. Additionally, 2-furanmethanol, d-limonene and maltol were selected to be the primary target compounds to assess the retention of odorants. This study observed a noticeable decrease in d-limonene content throughout the storage period. On the contrary, after 14 days of storage, the porous starch exhibited high retention of hydroxy compounds including 2-furanmethanol and maltol. However, after prolonged storage their ability to retain 2-furanmethanol and maltol slightly decreased. Therefore, the porous starch derived from mango seeds exhibited the potential to retain coffee aroma compounds and could be a desirable green adsorbent for food and cosmetic industries.",

This enhancement is achieved through the activity of microorganisms, which generate metabolites instrumental in the formation of distinct sensory profiles. This study investigated the impact of different fermentation methods on the quality of coffee beverages, specifically utilizing the Catiguá MG2 variety. The experimental setup involved fermenting the coffee in 200 L bioreactors, employing both natural and pulped coffee beans. The fermentation process utilized was self-induced anaerobic fermentation (SIAF), conducted in either a solid-state or submerged medium over a 96 h period. Analytical sampling was conducted initially and at 24 h intervals thereafter to quantify the concentration of sugars, alcohols, and organic acids. Sensory evaluation was performed using the established protocols of the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA). The outcomes of this investigation reveal that fermentation substantially enhances the quality of coffee, with each treatment protocol yielding divergent profiles of acids and alcohols, thereby influencing the sensory characteristics of the resulting beverage. Notably, superior quality beverages were produced from naturally processed coffee subjected to solid-state fermentation for durations exceeding 24 h. These findings underscore the significant influence of fermentation techniques and duration on the sensory attributes and overall quality of coffee."

Of the 3030 survey participants, 170 (5.6%) and 1,768 (58.3%) were identified as having migraine and non-migraine headache, respectively. Coffee consumption tended to increase in the order of non-headache, non-migraine headache, and migraine (linear-by-linear association, p = 0.011). Although psychiatric comorbidities (depression for migraine and anxiety for non-migraine headache) and stress significantly differed according to coffee consumption, most headache characteristics and accompanying symptoms did not differ among the three groups for participants with migraine and non-migraine headache. Response to acute headache treatment-adjusted for age, sex, depression, anxiety, stress, preventive medication use, and current smoking-was not significantly different by coffee consumption in participants with migraine and non-migraine headache. In conclusion, most headache-related characteristics and acute treatment response did not significantly differ by coffee consumption in migraine and non-migraine headache.",

Since a significant amount of antioxidant-rich cascara pulp are wasted in coffee processing, this study aimed to evaluate the safety of cascara extract cream of Gayo Arabica coffee pulp (CECGACP) as anti-photoaging in male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) by assessing the skin primary irritation index (PII), skin macroscopic changes and the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Twenty-five rats were randomly divided into five different groups: negative control (base cream only), positive control containing L-ascorbic acid 3%, and three treatment groups treated with cream containing 5%, 7.5% and 10% of CECGACP. The CECGACP was extracted, formulated into cream as a topical treatment and applied on the backs of the rats two times a day, once before the UV exposure and four hours after the exposure. After four weeks, the skins were macroscopically examined, and the TNF-α levels were measured. The PII was assessed after applying the cream 24 hours before UX exposure. Our data suggested that CECGACP was considered safe because there were no erythema and edema formation on the skin of the rats with PII score of 0 (classified as no irritation or negligible). After UV exposure, all rats had visible wrinkles and erythema on the skin in particular in the first week. After administration of CECGACP, both wrinkles and erythema were decreased. The levels of TNF-α varied from 0.15±0.02 ng/mL in the negative control and CECGACP 7.5% rat groups to 0.19±0.03 in the positive control group; however, there was no significant difference among all the groups. Our study suggests that CECGACP is safe to use in Wistar rats and able to reduce the erythema and edema due to UV exposure. However, the application of CECGACP does not provide a significant reduction of TNF-α levels."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the color and translucency of a nanoceramic resin subjected to hygiene practices and immersion in coffee over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens (n = 80, HT and LT, 0.5-mm thick) of a nanoceramic resin were obtained and were divided in groups according to the simulated oral hygiene: no intervention (NT), brushing with an electric brush and water (BN), brushing with an electric brush and toothpaste for 10 s (BT), and immersion in mouthwash for 30 s (MW). Oral hygiene practices were repeated after staining in coffee solution for 15, 48, 336, 1440, 8640, and 35,040 min. Spectral wavelengths were recorded with a spectrophotometer at each time. ∆E00, ∆L', ∆C', ∆H', and TP00 were calculated by CIEDE2000 and were evaluated by 2-way ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, and Tukey's HSD test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: ANOVA showed significance among factors for ΔE00 (p < 0.05), with higher ΔE00 for NT-HT (11.7) and NT-LT (11.2). After T6 (2-year simulation), the lowest values were found for BT-HT (5.3) and BT-LT (4.9). All groups showed a reduction in lightness and translucency and increased chroma and hue. However, the smallest variations were found in the BT groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Brushing with toothpaste effectively minimized the color change of NCRs caused by coffee staining. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Oral hygiene practices, such as brushing with toothpaste, might be important to minimize staining of nanoceramic resin restorations, especially in patients who frequently consume coffee.",

      "abstract": "The plant-parasitic root-knot nematode Meloidogyne exigua causes significant damage and is an important threat in Coffea arabica plantations. The utilization of plant-beneficial microbes as biological control agents against sedentary endoparasitic nematodes has been a longstanding strategy. However, their application in field conditions to control root-knot nematodes and their interaction with the rhizospheric microbiota of coffee plants remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of biological control agent-based bioproducts and a chemical nematicide, used in various combinations, on the control of root-knot nematodes and the profiling of the coffee plant rhizomicrobiome in a field trial. The commercially available biological products, including Trichoderma asperellum URM 5911 (Quality), Bacillus subtilis UFPEDA 764 (Rizos), Bacillus methylotrophicus UFPEDA 20 (Onix), and nematicide Cadusafos (Rugby), were applied to adult coffee plants. The population of second-stage juveniles (J2) and eggs, as well as plant yield, were evaluated over three consecutive years. However, no significant differences were observed between the control group and the groups treated with bioproducts and the nematicide. Furthermore, the diversity and community composition of bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotes in the rhizosphere soil of bioproduct-treated plants were evaluated. The dominant phyla identified in the 16 S, ITS2, and 18 S communities included Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Cercozoa in both consecutive years. There were no significant differences detected in the Shannon diversity of 16 S, ITS2, and 18 S communities between the years of data. The application of a combination of T. asperellum, B. subtilis, and B. methylotrophicus, as well as the use of Cadusafos alone and in combination with T. asperellum, B. subtilis, and B. methylotrophicus, resulted in a significant reduction (26.08%, 39.13%, and 21.73%, respectively) in the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Moreover, the relative abundance of Trichoderma spp. significantly increased by 500%, 200%, and 100% at the genus level, respectively, compared to the control treatment. By constructing a co-occurrence network, we discovered a complex network structure among the species in all the bioproduct-treated groups. However, our findings indicate that the introduction of exogenous beneficial microbes into field conditions was unable to modulate the existing microbiota significantly. These findings suggest that the applied bioproducts had no significant impact on the reshaping of the overall microbial diversity in the rhizosphere microbiome but rather recruited selected microrganisms and assured net return to the grower. The results underscore the intricate nature of the rhizosphere microbiome and suggest the necessity for alternate biocontrol strategies and a re-evaluation of agricultural practices to improve nematode control by aligning with the complex ecological interactions in the rhizosphere.",

      "abstract": "The use of residues from coffee production to obtain biochar is a sustainable approach, which aims to minimize the environmental impact of these materials. In this study, the effect of adding coffee straw biochar on the physiological quality of lettuce and sorghum seeds was investigated. Thus, the objective of this work was to study the effect of adding different concentrations of coffee biochar in the substrate composition on the physiological quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) seeds. The experimental design used was completely randomized, with five concentrations of biochar (0; 7.5; 15; 30 and 60%), conducted with four replications of 25 seeds. The use of biochar in the concentrations studied does not provide an increase in the average germination percentage and vigor of lettuce and sorghum seeds. The increase in the concentration of biochar caused less seed vigor, suggesting a toxic effect. For seed germination, there was no significant difference between lettuce and sorghum species, regardless of treatment. For the germination speed index, sorghum seeds have higher means, except for the treatment with the addition of 15% coffee straw biochar. Lettuce seeds have higher shoot length averages, except for treatment with 100% commercial substrate. The sorghum seeds have higher mean root length and dry mass than lettuce, regardless of the treatment.",

      "abstract": "Several pests affect coffee (Coffea spp., Rubiaceae) and macadamia, Macadamia integrifolia Maiden & Betche (Proteaceae) in Hawaii. The coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), is the most damaging to coffee, while the tropical nut borer, Hypothenemus obscurus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), is one of the worst pests of macadamia. This paper investigates the potential efficacy of a long-lasting insecticide-incorporated net (LLIN) under laboratory conditions to manage these pests. The LLIN (40 denier with mesh size 625 knots/in²), incorporated with α-cypermethrin (0.34%), was excised into 100 mm circles and inserted in 100 mm Petri dishes. Nets with the same quality but without insecticides were used as control treatments. Twenty beetles (H. obscurus or H. hampei) each were placed on the treated and non-treated netting at 4 treatment or exposure hours-1, 6, 12, and 24-with 5 replicates. Subsequently, the beetles were ranked alive, affected, or dead. The results showed that the LLIN with α-cypermethrin had significant lethal and sub-lethal effects on both Hypothenemus species, causing over 90% mortality after 24 h of exposure and paralysis after 1, 6, and 12 h of exposure. The highest lethality value was recorded after 24 h of exposure for both H. obscurus and H. hampei. The LT50 of H. obscurus and H. hampei was 18.78 min and 2.15 h, respectively, while the LT90 values were 32.11 and 20.67 h. These results imply the potential effectiveness of LLINs with α-cypermethrin for management of H. obscurus and H. hampei, but field studies are warranted for optimization.",

      "abstract": "With increasing coffee consumption worldwide, the efficient and sustainable management of spent coffee grounds (SCG) has become increasingly challenging. This study investigated the anaerobic co-digestion of small amounts of SCG with food waste (FW) at increasing co-feeding ratios of 1:100-1:10 (volatile solids basis) to assess the possibility of SCG treatment using the spare capacity of existing anaerobic digesters. Co-feeding SCG increased methane production compared to FW mono-digestion in the tested range of co-feeding ratios without compromising process stability. Methane yield did not further increase when the SCG/FW ratio increased above 4%, and process failure occurred at a 1:10 co-feeding ratio without trace element supplementation. The enhanced methanogenic performance was attributed to increased protein removal efficiency, which was potentially related to the promotion of peptide hydrolysis. The overall results suggest that co-feeding appropriate small amounts of SCG to FW digesters can be a realistic sustainable option for SCG management.",

      "abstract": "The biopurification systems (BPS) or biobeds are employed for the treatment of pesticide-containing wastewater of agricultural origin. The use of these devices for pesticide removal requires the proper optimization of the composition of biomixtures (BPS active matrix) according to the target pesticides applied on a specific crop and the available materials used in their elaboration. This work aims to design a biomixture for the simultaneous treatment of several pesticides applied in coffee crops, according to local practices in Costa Rica. Three biomixtures containing either coffee husk, coconut fiber or rice husk (as the lignocellulosic substrate) were applied for the removal of 12 pesticides. The profiles of pesticide elimination and the mineralization of radiolabeled chlorpyrifos (14C-chlorpyrifos) revealed that the best performance was achieved with the coconut fiber biomixture, even though similar detoxification patterns were determined in every biomixture (according to immobilization in Daphnia magna and germination tests in Lactuca sativa). The optimization of this biomixture's composition by means of a central composite design permitted the definition of two optimal compositions (compost:soil:coconut fiber, % v/v) that maximized pesticide removal: i. 29:7.3:63.7 and ii. 11:7.3:81.7. The validation of these optimized compositions also included the use of an alternative soil from another coffee farm and resulted in overall DT50 values of 7.8-9.0 d for the pesticide mixture. Considering the removal kinetics in the optimized biomixture, a 1 m3 BPS prototype was dimensioned to be eventually used in local coffee farms. This work provides relevant information for the design and implementation of BPS at on-farm conditions for the treatment of pesticide-containing wastewater of a major crop."

The increasing prevalence of this health condition and the low rates of patients' quality of life, combined with the lack of suitable pharmacologic treatments, evidence the demand to research new alternatives. Polyphenols may be potential therapeutic candidates as they have been reported to exert pathological pain modulation in preclinical models. In that context, this work was aimed to study the antinociceptive effects of a polyphenolic extract obtained from decaffeinated ground roasted coffee, in the RIM6 FM-like mouse model. METHODS: To this end, RIM6 adult ICR-CD1 female mice were administered daily once a week with either 10 or 15 mg/kg of extract, and reflexive pain responses were evaluated for up to 3 weeks. At the end, the depressive-like behavior was assessed as a nonreflexive pain response, and spinal cord and serum samples were collected for immunohistochemical and toxicological analyses. RESULTS: These findings showed that the repeated administration of the coffee polyphenolic extract (CE) modulated reflexive pain responses, depressive-like behavior, and spinal cord gliosis in a dose-dependent manner, without signs of systemic toxicity. CONCLUSION: Thus, the CE may be a potential pharmacological treatment suitable to relieve nociplastic pain responses characteristic of FM.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The shelf-life of cold and hot water extraction coffees based on sensory and chemical profiles and microbial growth was examined, which also allowed the study of the influence of extraction temperature on the chemical and sensorial profiles of coffee. The shelf life of refrigerated cold- and hot-brewed coffee was limited not by microbial stability but rather by deterioration in sensory attributes. Further work is recommended to elucidate the mechanisms of coffee staling in a refrigerated environment, with particular interest in the degradation products of chlorogenic acid, as a significant decline in chlorogenic acid concentration was found over the storage period. Cold-extracted coffees were found to be chemically and sensorially different beverages from coffees extracted at high temperatures. Additionally, the cold-brewed coffees had greater sensory flavor stability over the storage time than the hot-brewed treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study advances the industry's understanding of the shelf life of ready-to-drink bottled cold coffees and demonstrates that lower brewing temperatures lead to greater flavor stability over shelf life. The findings also provide brewing parameters that can help guide product developers in modulating the flavor of commercial cold coffees."
