      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Smoking reduction or cessation are critical public health goals, given the well-documented risks of tobacco use to health. Reducing smoking frequency and cessation entirely are challenging due to nicotine addiction and withdrawal symptoms, which can significantly affect mental wellness and overall wellbeing. Previous research has suggested that certain dietary supplements may support smoking cessation and reduction efforts by mitigating these adverse effects. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of supplementation with 900 mg/day of Neuravena®, a green oat extract (GOE) of Avena sativa L., in enhancing wellness and wellbeing during a smoking reduction or cessation experience. METHODS: This was an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, ClinicalTrials Identifier: NCT04749017 (https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04749017). Participants were assigned to one of the study groups, 72 participants were assigned to GOE and 73 to placebo. The subjects were followed for 8-weeks intervention period as well as an additional 4-week follow-up period. At subsequent visits, they underwent clinical assessments including assessments of quality of life, perceived stress, depression, nicotine dependence, anxiety, cognitive performance, and specific assessments of craving intensity. RESULTS: GOE was associated with greater improvements in elements of the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire as compared with placebo. Similar results were obtained from the SF-36 questionnaire and a visual QoL analogue scale (VAS). Perceived stress levels showed greater decline from baseline among the GOE supplemented participants as compared to placebo. Sleep quality parameters improved with GOE supplementation and worsened in the placebo group. At the end of the intervention period, the percentage of successful reducers (defined as >20% reduction in daily cigarettes) was higher in the GOE group as compared to placebo (66.7% vs. 49.3%, p = 0.034). The improvements from baseline in QoL measures in the GOE group persisted at 4 weeks after termination of the intervention. CONCLUSION: GOE supplementation demonstrated greater improvements in quality of life measures, stress and sleep related parameters during a smoking reduction or cessation experience and the product was shown to be safe and well tolerated."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart health benefits have been attributed to regular consumption of oats. Preclinical evidence suggests that a wild green oat extract (WGOE) may improve vasodilator function, but this is yet to be evaluated in humans. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether regular daily consumption of WGOE can influence vasodilator function in systemic and cerebral arteries. METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy older adults (>60 years) completed a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-way crossover dietary intervention with 1500 mg/day of encapsulated WGOE or placebo. All assessments were conducted at the end of each 12-week intervention arm, after participants had fasted for at least 4 h and at least 18 h after they had taken their last dose of supplement. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and hypercapnia-induced increases of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery were used to measure systemic and cerebral vasodilator responsiveness (CVR), respectively. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, WGOE supplementation increased CVR and FMD to a similar extent (42 and 41%, respectively, P < 0.01 for both). The improvements in CVR and FMD were not correlated. Resting blood pressure did not alter with supplementation. Dose and treatment duration were well tolerated by participants. CONCLUSION: WGOE supplementation can improve vasodilator function in systemic and cerebral arteries, suggesting a potential role in the maintenance of cardiovascular health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Preliminary evaluation of a wild green oat extract (WGOE) (Neuravena(®) ELFA(®)955, Frutarom, Switzerland) revealed an acute cognitive benefit of supplementation. This study investigated whether regular daily WGOE supplementation would result in sustained cognitive improvements. METHOD: A 12-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of WGOE supplementation (1500 mg/day) versus placebo was undertaken in 37 healthy adults aged 67 ± 0.8 years (mean ± SEM). Cognitive assessments included the Stroop colour-word test, letter cancellation, the rule-shift task, a computerised multi-tasking test battery and the trail-making task. All assessments were conducted in Week 12 and repeated in Week 24 whilst subjects were fasted and at least 18 h after taking the last dose of supplement. RESULT: Chronic WGOE supplementation did not affect any measures of cognition. CONCLUSION: It appears that the cognitive benefit of acute WGOE supplementation does not persist with chronic treatment in older adults with normal cognition. It remains to be seen whether sustained effects of WGOE supplementation may be more evident in those with mild cognitive impairment.",
