      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is no effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and pharmacological treatment of AD in clinical settings is expensive and prolonged, resulting in a huge psychological and economic burden on the patient's family and caregivers and society as a whole, AD is characterized by progressive, worsening cognitive impairment, and there are currently no drugs that can effectively reverse cognitive impairment. However, it is important to intervene early or delay cognitive impairment so that the condition can be delayed and, ultimately, the burden on patients and families can be reduced through maintenance treatment. It may be that non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) can help with cognitive dysfunction. AIM: To provide a better treatment plan for AD patients and delay the deterioration of cognitive function, the effect of CST on cognitive function in AD was studied by Meta-analysis. METHODS: Comprehensive search the Chinese and English databases were comprehensively searched by computer. Chinese databases: China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Wanfang Database, VIP Database, and China Periodicals Full-text Database (CNKI). The collection time limit is from July 21, 2010 to July 21, 2022 randomized controlled trials literature on the effects of CST on cognitive function in patients with AD. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, literature screening, data extraction, and quality evaluation were performed. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI were used as evaluation criteria to evaluate the cognitive function of CST in AD patients. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection were performed on the results. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, and funnel plot symmetry was assessed with Eggr's test. RESULTS: CST can not improve Mental State Examination Scale (MMSE) scores in AD patients. Meta-analysis of CST on MMSE scores showed that the heterogeneity was P = 0.14, I 2 = 35%. I 2 = 35% < 50%, and the Q test P > 0.1, choose the random effect model to integrate statistics, get SMD = 0.02, 95%CI: -0.37, 0.42, P > 0.05. Meta-analysis of CST on AD Cognitive Functioning Assessment Scale scores showed that the heterogeneity was P = 0.13, I 2 = 36%. I 2 = 36% < 50 choose a fixed effect model to integrate statistics, get SMD = -0.01, 95%CI: -0.40, 0.39, P > 0.05, the difference is not statistically significant. Meta-analysis of CST on the cognitive function indicators of patients showed that the heterogeneity was P = 0.17, I 2 = 31%. I 2 = 31% < 50%, the fixed effect model showed SMD = 0.01, 95%CI: -0.37, 0.38, P > 0.05, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: CST may not improve the cognitive function of AD patients, not improve the cognitive function of AD patients, not improve the ability of daily living, and not reduce mental behavior can improve the cognitive function of AD patients."

With the high prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in Missouri, CST provides an effective approach to address dementia-related symptoms. This paper aims to inform healthcare professionals about the benefits and practical applications of CST, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the cognitive, emotional, and social needs of dementia patients. Despite the heavy reliance on pharmacological treatments for dementia, CST stands out as a viable alternative, offering improvements in memory, language, executive function, and alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety. CST's adaptability across diverse settings, including community centers, residential care homes, and virtual platforms, ensures broad accessibility. Research and training initiatives led by Saint Louis University further highlight CST's growing role in dementia care within the US healthcare system. Embracing CST in clinical practice is not just an option but a necessity to improve the lives of individuals with dementia and alleviate the growing burden on healthcare systems in Missouri and beyond.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidelines recommend personalized activities and group cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) for promoting cognition, independence, and well-being in persons with dementia. Constructive engagement (CE), the state of being occupied positively in purposeful activities, is theoretically an essential process in personalized activities and CST. However, whether CE develops over time and what contributes to it are unknown. We investigated changes in CE during CST and its contributors. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods study. We used time sampling to record the time proportion of persons with dementia (n = 113) spent in constructive, passive, non-task-related engagement and non-engagement during early, middle, and late phases in a 14-session group CST. We tested changes in time proportion between phases using repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA). We analyzed qualitative interviews of CST facilitators (n = 12) thematically to explore contributors to CE. RESULTS: Persons with dementia spent 51% and 46% of their time in constructive and passive engagement, respectively. Time of engagement in non-task-related activities and non-engagement was minimal. CE remained stable at around 50% of activity time throughout the intervention course, except for a slight increase from the early to middle phase (48% to 55%, F (2224) = 3.779, p < 0.05). Age (r = -0.26, p < 0.01), cognitive function (r = -0.29, p < 0.01), and activities of daily living (r = 0.20, p < 0.05) at baseline were significantly correlated with CE, but gender and education were not. Contributors to CE include (1) tailoring activities, (2) using group dynamics, and (3) promoting positive experiences. DISCUSSIONS: Group CST engages persons with dementia well, regardless of their differences in gender and literacy levels. CE remained relatively stable during CST, and younger, more physically and cognitively able people showed slightly greater CE. In group-based interventions, facilitators' skills and techniques could enhance CE. Future studies may focus on how CE as a plausible change mechanism further improves the intervention outcomes of persons with dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a non-pharmacological intervention that involves group-based activities and exercises to improve cognition and quality of life for persons with dementia, but the specific mechanisms behind it are not yet fully understood.This study is the first to investigate constructive engagement (CE), which describes active involvement in meaningful activities or complex interventions, specifically CST, for persons with dementia.CST engages them well, regardless of gender and literacy differences. CE time increases at the early intervention phase and stabilizes later on. CE occupies around half of the intervention time throughout CST, which can still be further increased by activity design and facilitators' skills."

Cultural adaptation is needed to ensure Māori with dementia can benefit from this evidence-based treatment. This paper reports the outcome of a project aimed to adapt CST for Māori. We followed the five phases of international guidelines using the formative method for adapting CST to other cultures, including a critical cultural examination of the 18 CST principles. We piloted two CST-Māori programmes and collected pre- and post-outcome measures using the RUDAS and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Written qualitative feedback was sought from participants and their family at the end of the CST-Māori programme. A total of 15 Māori (female: 53.3%) participated in the two programmes. Their mean age was 75.9 years (SD = 6.6) and mean baseline RUDAS scores was 17.7 (SD = 2.3). There was a statistically significant improvement in cognition (RUDAS: pre = 17.7, post = 19.4, p = 0.003) and in the WHOQOL subscales of physical (pre = 75.9, post = 88.5, p = 0.003), psychological (pre = 72.7, post = 81.3, p = 0.024) and environment (pre-80.6, post = 88.0, p = 0.006). Written feedback confirmed the acceptability of this culturally adapted programme by Māori living with dementia and their whanau (families). CST was successfully adapted for Māori with dementia. It is a culturally acceptable cognitive intervention and preliminary data confirmed the effectiveness of CST-Māori in improving cognition and quality of life."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a group psychosocial intervention for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. Despite evidence supporting its effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and cultural adaptation internationally, CST has yet to be implemented in routine practice outside of the UK. This study consisted of multiple phases. In the first phase, we engaged stakeholders to explore the barriers and facilitators to CST implementation in Tanzania. In the second phase, we developed implementation strategies. In the third phase, we tested these strategies in a study of CST in a tertiary hospital in northern Tanzania. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided the study. We conducted stakeholder engagement with decision-makers, healthcare professionals, people with dementia and their family caregivers (n = 49) to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. We developed an implementation plan that included 20 implementation strategies related to 12 CFIR constructs. Subsequently, we tested these strategies by running eight CST groups with 49 participants. In follow-up interviews with people with dementia, carers and healthcare professionals, we identified 18 key CFIR constructs as barriers or facilitators to successfully implementing CST. CST was compatible with the standards of care in a tertiary referral hospital in northern Tanzania. To implement CST in low-resource settings, we recommend running dementia awareness initiatives, screening for dementia in outpatients and community settings, developing a train-the-trainer model, employing a task-shifting approach, and creating a dementia-friendly space for dementia services. Our findings can inform future efforts to implement CST and other psychosocial interventions for dementia in low-resource settings.

Previous research on individual CST delivered by family carers showed no significant improvements in people with dementia. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Virtual Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (V-iCST) delivered by healthcare personnel. METHODS: Mixed methods feasibility randomised controlled trial. Thirty-four participants were randomly allocated to either 14 sessions of twice-weekly V-iCST (n = 17) or treatment as usual (n = 17) delivered over seven weeks. We assessed cognition, QoL, communication, and depressive symptoms pre/post-treatment. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with participants and carers (n = 15) following V-iCST, analysed with thematic analysis. RESULTS: High levels of attendance, adherence, completion of outcomes, and moderate fidelity. There were no significant between-group changes, but there was a positive trend in cognition. Qualitative findings suggested that V-iCST was valued and convenient but can evoke negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: V-iCST was feasible and acceptable. Preliminary data indicate that V-iCST delivered by healthcare personnel might meet a critical gap through increasing access to those who cannot or prefer not to attend in-person CST/groups. The need for remote treatments and CST being the main psychosocial intervention emphasizes the need for definitive trial."

Nevertheless, the question of whether specific subgroups of individuals with dementia are more or less likely to benefit from this cognitive stimulation intervention remains unaddressed. Here, we directly compared the effectiveness of the Italian CST (CST-IT), delivered in a previous multicenter controlled clinical trial, across two distinct cohorts of individuals clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD, N = 30) and vascular dementia (VaD, N = 27) in the mild-to-moderate stage. METHOD: The impact of dementia subtype (AD vs VaD) on immediate (at intervention completion) benefits of CST-IT in general cognitive functioning, communicative abilities, mood, behavior and perceived quality of life was evaluated through linear mixed effects models. The frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline was inserted as a covariate due to the different behavioral profile in the two groups. Exploratory analyses also investigated the potential differential effect of dementia subtype on long-term benefits (three months after intervention). RESULTS: The CST-IT determined comparable immediate, clinically significant improvements in general cognition and communicative abilities. Dementia subtype influenced short-term benefits in depressive symptoms (with a greater decrease in AD patients) and quality of life (no significant impact in AD, and a small improvement in VaD). Such effects depended on diagnosis-related differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms. At long-term, benefits persisted in general cognition (though depending on the outcome considered). Improvements in narratives were seen in VaD, whereas communicative abilities in AD returned to baseline. Post-intervention gains in depressive symptoms persisted in AD, but not in VaD, although benefits in quality of life remained stable in the latter. CONCLUSIONS: Different mechanisms of neuropsychological change after CST-IT were hypothesized for the different forms of dementia, particularly with respect to crucial outcomes such as language, mood and quality of life, with implications toward the delivery of such psychosocial intervention in clinical contexts."

METHOD: The sample for this pragmatic study were people with dementia who underwent CST between May 2016 and September 2022 during routine healthcare. Measures of participants' psychoaffective symptoms and QOL were administered before CST ('baseline') and following CST ('post-intervention'). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and their sum score (referred to as HADS-total). The Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale was used to measure participants' quality of life (both patient and carer ratings were available). Change in these outcomes was assessed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-five participants attended ≥1 session of adapted CST (84% attended at least 9/14 sessions, considered 'high' adherence). The mean change [95% confidence interval] in HADS-total scores indicated improvement (-0.9; [-1.9, -0.0]). Mean scores on the other outcomes showed neither improvement nor worsening. CONCLUSION: Overall, this pragmatic study shows that an adapted 14-week face-to-face CST protocol is effective in improving mental health in people with mild dementia and has the potential to be widely implemented within routine healthcare.",

The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of CST for older adults with intellectual disability to support active ageing. METHODS: Five client participants attended a 14-session CST group and four staff attended a focus group. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to investigate the client and staff narratives. RESULTS: Three key themes were generated: (1) Brain Health, (2) Connecting with others, and (3) Barriers and Enablers. CONCLUSION: Findings indicated the suitability of CST as a way of supporting active ageing for older adults with intellectual disability. This study adds to the growing knowledge about service provision for older adults and their changing needs as they age and identifies clinical implications such as staff training to support intervention adherence.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) in patients with vascular cognitive impairment has not been explored, and no studies investigating CST in the convalescent rehabilitation phase have been reported. This study examined the effect of CST on the cognitive function of patients with vascular cognitive impairment. A randomized controlled, assessor-blinded, single-centered trial with two parallel groups was conducted in a convalescent rehabilitation hospital. Twenty participants were randomly allocated to CST (n=10) and control (n=10) groups. Participants in the CST group underwent two CST sessions a day, five times a week for 8 weeks, in addition to conventional rehabilitation. Participants in the control group underwent conventional rehabilitation only. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and the outcome between the groups was compared using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). The mean (standard deviation) scores of MMSE increased by 3.50 (3.08) points and 4.50 (1.61) points from baseline to the end of the study (week 8) in the CST and control groups, respectively. The GLMM showed a significant effect of TIME on MMSE (F=21.121, P<0.001), whereas no significant effect on MMSE was observed for GROUP (intervention vs. control, P=0.817) or the interaction term (TIME×GROUP, P=0.649). Although a significant improvement in cognitive function was observed in each group, no significant effect of CST was evident. This result indicates that the effect may have been masked by improvements caused by natural history or rehabilitation. Future studies with a sufficient sample size are required to confirm the findings.",

CST has been culturally adapted for use globally. It was developed as a face-to-face intervention but has recently been adapted for online delivery. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of online or virtual CST (vCST) delivery in India and Brazil, emphasizing barriers and facilitators to implementation. METHODS: A single-group, multisite, mixed methods, feasibility study was conducted, with nested qualitative interviews. Primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate, attendance, attrition, acceptability, and outcome measure completion. Exploratory pre- and postintervention measures, including cognition and quality of life, were assessed. Qualitative interviews were conducted with people with dementia, family caregivers, and group and organizational leaders following intervention delivery, and the data were analyzed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. RESULTS: A total of 17 vCST group sessions with 59 participants were conducted for 7 weeks, with 53% (31/59) of participants attending all 14 sessions. Attrition rate was 7% (4/59), and outcome measure completion rate at follow-up was 68% (40/59). Interviews took place with 36 stakeholders. vCST was acceptable to participants and group leaders and enabled vital access to services during pandemic restrictions. While online services broadened geographic access, challenges emerged concerning inadequate computer literacy, poor technology access, and establishing interpersonal connections online. Exploratory, uncontrolled analyses indicated positive trends in quality of life but negative trends in cognition and activities of daily living, but these results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: vCST demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, serving as a crucial resource during the pandemic but raised challenges related to technology access, computer literacy, and long-term implementation. The study highlights the potential of vCST while emphasizing ongoing development and solutions to address implementation challenges.",

Many people are unable to attend face-to-face groups for reasons including health and transport issues. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of online or \"virtual\" CST (vCST). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Single-blind, randomized controlled feasibility design with qualitative interviews. Forty-six people with mild-to-moderate dementia were randomly allocated to attend either 14 sessions of twice-weekly vCST (n = 24) or treatment as usual (TAU, defined as usual care; n = 22) over 7 weeks. Cognition, quality of life, and depression were assessed pre- and posttreatment. Qualitative interviews (n = 16) with participants and carers were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: High levels of attendance, adherence, fidelity to the manual, and completion of outcomes were recorded. Recruitment appeared feasible although randomization may not have been acceptable to some. There were no statistical differences noted between vCST and TAU in any of the outcomes evaluated, although both quantitative and qualitative data indicated acceptability, with qualitative reports of improved outcomes including cognition. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: vCST appeared feasible to deliver but did not result in any changes in outcomes, as expected from an underpowered feasibility trial. CST is the main psychosocial intervention delivered for dementia in UK memory services and globally, with many services moving towards virtual CST delivery. Therefore, a fully powered RCT of the effectiveness of vCST is feasible and justified.",

METHODS: Four databases were searched, up to May 2023, for randomized controlled trials of CST using the original protocol. Pre- and post-test means and measures of dispersion for intervention and control groups were extracted for each reported outcome and used to calculate effect sizes. Effect sizes were grouped by outcome and pooled in inverse variance weighted random effects models. RESULTS: Twelve studies were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. Of these, ten were given either a 'high' or 'medium' quality rating. The pooled results indicated that CST had a significant beneficial impact on global cognition, language, working memory, depression, neuropsychiatric symptoms, communication, self-reported quality of life and severity of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: CST as delivered in adherence to the original 14-session protocol is an efficacious treatment for mild to moderate dementia with improvements in cognition, affective symptoms and quality of life demonstrated from global trials.",

Decline in IC has been shown to accelerate the trajectory of frailty. We aim to show the impact of exercise (Ex) and cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) on (i) IC domains and composite score (ii) frailty and functional ability in pre-frail older adults. Secondary analysis of data from a pre-post intervention study of pre-frail older adults ≥ 65 years attending primary care clinic. Control (CON) and 2 intervention groups ((i) Ex 6 months (ii) CST 3 months with Ex 6 months (Ex+CST)) were recruited. Pre-frailty was determined using the FRAIL scale. Questionnaires (on demographics, functional ability, and depression) were administered and physical function assessment (gait speed (GS), short physical performance battery (SPPB) test, handgrip strength, five times sit-to-stand (5x-STS)) was conducted at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. Four domains of IC were evaluated: locomotion (GS and 5x-STS), vitality (nutrition and muscle mass), cognition (MoCA and subjective cognitive decline) and psychological (depression and anxiety). Each domain was scored from 0 to 2 (no decline) with total IC score ranging from 0 to 8. 187 participants completed baseline and 3 months assessments, 109 (58.3%) were allocated to CON, 37 (19.8%) to Ex and 41 (21.9%) to Ex + CST groups. At 3 months, both Ex and Ex +CST showed improvement in IC composite scores, locomotion, and psychological domain scores but improvement in cognition domain only in Ex + CST group. At 6 months, there were improvements in total IC score, locomotion, vitality, and psychological domain in both Ex and Ex + CST groups. At 12 months, significant improvement was evident in total IC score for Ex and Ex+CST groups, vitality when fatigue (in addition to muscle mass and nutrition) was added and instrumental activities of daily living. Multidomain intervention incorporating exercise and CST resulted in significant improvement in IC composite scores, locomotion, vitality, cognition, and psychological domains.",

METHODS: Reflexive thematic analysis was used to understand the experiences of 11 carers using iCST for 8 wk. Three semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant, including a pre-assessment of caregiver burden and a rating of dementia severity. RESULTS: Most carers described the manual as self-instructive. Some felt overwhelmed when starting iCST. It was important to plan and individualise the sessions to the specific needs of the person with dementia. After delivering iCST the carers described new insights into the person with dementia's resources and challenges. Obstacles to doing iCST were related to the context, the manual or to specific challenges linked to the person with dementia or to the carer. Most participants described positive experiences, in which shared interaction, engagement and mastery were common. CONCLUSION: When the carer understands the iCST programme as a tool and adapts it to the specific needs of the person with dementia then co-occupation and positive interactions happen. However, some carers would benefit from supervision and the iCST programme did not address all persons with dementia.",

A total of 280 patients diagnosed with primary NSCLC were randomized into RAM-based CST group and control group. Outcomes were assessed at three intervals: pre-surgery, discharge, and one-month post-discharge. Cognitive function was evaluated using Mini-Cognitive test. Postoperative delirium prevalence was determined within 48 hours post-surgery using Nursing Delirium Screening Scale. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale evaluated anxiety and depression symptoms, while Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed via Short Form-36 (SF36) Health Survey. The RAM-based CST group demonstrated significantly higher Mini-Cog test scores than the control group upon discharge and post-intervention. Patients with RAM-based CST exhibited a decrease in postoperative delirium compared to the control group. The RAM-based CST intervention yielded an improvement in anxiety and depression at discharge and 1-month post-discharge compared to preoperative levels. Additionally, the RAM-based CST group exhibited substantial enhancements in SF36 subcategory scores at 1-month post-discharge compared to pre-surgery. At post-intervention, the RAM-based CST group demonstrated significantly higher scores than the control group across various health-related domains, including role limitations due to emotional problems, mental health, general health perception, bodily pain, and role limitations due to physical problems. The RAM-based CST intervention in elderly NSCLC patients undergoing curative resection yielded significant enhancements in cognitive function, reduced delirium incidence, improved emotional well-being, and better QoL postoperatively.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dementia is characterized by neurocognitive decline which interferes with daily function and independence. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is an evidence-based cognitive psychosocial intervention for people with dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective interventional study of single-blind RCT design conducted in the Department of Neurology at ABVIMS and Dr RML Hospital amongst patients with DSM-V major neurocognitive disorder aged more than 50 years. Participants were randomized to CST and control groups using a block-randomized design. The control group participants received treatment as usual while the CST group delivered 45-min virtual group CST sessions for a total of 14 sessions over seven weeks. All participants in both groups were assessed at baseline and eight weeks using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), neuropsychiatric inventory, instrumental activities of daily living, and Zarit Burden Interview for Caregiver Burden (ZBI) by a rater blind to group randomization. RESULTS: Total MoCA scores improved significantly in the CST group, compared to the control group which showed a statistically significant decrease. The mean total ADAS-Cog score in the CST group improved significantly compared to controls. The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale showed a statistically significant change in the control group compared to the intervention group. From the comparison of the mean total neuropsychiatric inventory scale, it was observed that there was a statistically significant decrease in the severity of Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) symptoms in the CST group. The mean total ZBI score decreased significantly in the CST group favoring less caregiver burden. CONCLUSION: This study proved that CST has a significant impact on cognitive outcomes in dementia and it also proved its effectiveness in controlling the BPSD outcomes and caregiver burden in dementia."

Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a group-based intervention that has shown to have benefits on activities of daily living and mood for people with dementia in Brazil. This study aims to explore the experiences and perceived changes following CST groups. METHODS: Individual interviews were conducted with the participants of the group (n = 12) and their caregivers (n = 11). Framework analysis was used to inspect the data. RESULTS: Two main themes have emerged: 'Personal benefits of being part of the group', containing two subthemes: 'Benefits for caregivers' and 'Benefits for person with dementia' and 'Day-to-day changes', containing seven subthemes; 'Memory', Sociability', 'Language', 'Mood', 'Orientation', 'Everyday activities' and 'Behavioural and psychological symptoms'. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that CST groups led to perceived personal benefits for the people with dementia and caregivers and that there are perceived changes for the participants of the groups.",

This study aimed i) to evaluate impact of 6 months exercise (Ex) versus complementary effect of 3 months of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) to 6 months of Ex (Ex+CST) on physical function, muscle mass and cognition versus control group at 3, 6 and 12 months ii) inflammatory biomarkers such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α). DESIGN: Cluster randomised control trial. SETTING AND INTERVENTION: Pre-frail older adults ≥ 65 years attending primary care clinic. Two intervention groups i) Ex 6 months ii) CST 3 months with Ex 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: At 0, 3, 6 and 12 months, questionnaires (on demographics, physical function, cognition, and depression) were administered and physical function assessment (gait speed, short physical performance battery (SPPB) test, handgrip strength, five times sit-to-stand (5x-STS)) was conducted. Muscle mass and its surrogates such as phase angle and body cell mass were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis machine. Inflammatory biomarkers were measured at 0 and 3 months. RESULTS: Data from 190 participants was analysed at 3 months (111 control, 37 Ex and 41 Ex+CST). At 3 months, significant improvement in cognition was seen only in the Ex+CST group whereas improvements in depression, gait speed, SPPB and 5x-STS were seen in both the Ex and Ex+CST groups. At 6 months, the Ex+CST group improved in cognition and depression whereas improvement in frailty and muscle mass indices were seen in both the interventions groups. At 12 months, both the interventions groups had better perceived health, gait speed and less decline in muscle mass compared with control groups. Both the Ex and Ex+CST had significant association with TNF-α at 3 months (β -2.71 (95% CI -4.80 - -0.62); p = 0.012 and β -1.74 (95% CI -3.43 - -0.06); p = 0.043 respectively). CONCLUSION: Combined Ex+CST had significant improvement in cognition whereas the intervention groups improved in depression, physical function, muscle mass, frailty, perceived health and TNF-α levels. With growing evidence of the benefits of multicomponent interventions at primary care level, incorporating it into mainstream care with action plans on long-term sustainability and scalability should be a priority for every country.",

Increasing number of meta-analyses has examined the efficacy of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) for dementia. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reports that specifically discuss the strength of evidence to support CST for dementia. PURPOSE: This study aimed to summarize evidence regarding the efficacy of CST on people with dementia. DESIGN: Umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. METHODS: We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc), and VIP databases from inception to December 31, 2022. The methodological quality of the identified studies was assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2). Studies scoring 9-12 (moderate quality) points or higher were further analyzed using Grades of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) principles. RESULTS: A total of 14 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included in the umbrella review. The methodological quality of most included reviews was rated as moderate according to AMSTAR 2 rating system. In these studies, we summarized the characteristics of the content, providers, frequency, period and setting of CST, and examined eight health outcomes related to CST, including cognition, depression, behavioral symptoms, quality of life (QoL), activities of daily living (ADL), language and communication, anxiety, and memory. Eleven studies with low to high rating of overall confidence (OC) consistently reported that CST could significantly improve cognition of people with dementia, including high-quality supporting evidence. However, the effect of CST on other health outcomes for people with dementia (e.g., depression, behavioral symptoms, QoL, ADL) is inconsistent, with low- to moderate-quality evidence ratings. Compared with the above results, few studies have reported the effects of CST on communication, anxiety, and memory for people with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, the design and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses should incorporate high-quality research metrics in accordance with AMSTAR 2 criteria. The current review supports CST as an effective treatment for improving cognitive function in patients with dementia. Multi-component interventions are more effective than single-component interventions and need to be delivered regularly.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of dementia is almost five times higher in people with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population. However, evidence-based treatments for this population are lacking, as most randomised controlled trials for dementia interventions have not included people with intellectual disabilities. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) has a robust evidence base in the general dementia population, consistently showing benefits to cognition, quality of life and being cost-effective. We are conducting a mixed-methods feasibility trial of group CST for people with intellectual disabilities and dementia, to determine if a future definitive randomised controlled trial is feasible. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Fifty individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia will be randomised to either the intervention arm (14 sessions of group CST plus treatment as usual) or the control arm (treatment as usual). Randomisation will occur after informed consent has been obtained and baseline assessments completed. Each arm will have 25 participants, with the intervention arm divided into five or more CST groups with three to five participants in each. The outcomes will be feasibility of recruitment, acceptability and adherence of the intervention, suitability of study outcome measures and feasibility of collecting resource use data. Quantitative and qualitative approaches, including semistructured interviews with group participants, carers and group facilitators, will be employed to assess these outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by Essex REC (Ref: 21/EE/027) and the HRA ethical approval process through the Integrated Research Application System (IRAS ID: 306 756). We plan to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals and conferences as well as provide feedback to funders, sponsors and study participants. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN88614460.",

This program evaluation examined the outcomes of a modified CST program in a veteran sample. METHODS: Twenty-five veterans who participated in a once-weekly, 7-week CST program and completed pre/post-group assessments were selected for inclusion in this chart review study. In this diverse sample (Mage = 74.40; 44% White, 44% Hispanic/Latinx, 8% Black, 4% multiracial), most had a suspected neurodegenerative etiology. Paired-samples t-test examined QoL and cognitive pre/post-intervention scores. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were observed in RBANS total index scores (Cohen's d = 0.46). Although there was not a statistically significant change in MoCA scores or patient QoL-AD ratings, there were small effects in the predicted direction (Cohen's d = 0.29 and 0.30, respectively). There was no significant change or effect on caregiver QoL-AD ratings (Cohen's d = .09). CONCLUSIONS: A modified, once-weekly 7-week CST program for veterans was feasible and demonstrated positive outcomes. Improvements were observed in global cognition and there was a small, positive effect on patient-rated QoL. Given that dementia is often progressive, stability of cognition and QoL are suggestive of the protective effects of CST. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: CST is feasible and beneficial as a once-weekly brief group intervention for veterans with cognitive impairment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is the only non-pharmacological, treatment for dementia recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, following multiple international trials demonstrating beneficial cognitive outcomes in people with mild-to-moderate dementia. However, there is limited understanding of whether treatment prognosis is influenced by sociodemographic and clinical variables (such as dementia subtype and gender), information which could inform clinical decision-making. AIM: We describe the protocol for a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis assessing the prognostic factors related to CST. In publishing this protocol, we hope to increase the transparency of our work, and keep healthcare professionals aware of the latest evidence for effective CST. METHOD: A systematic review will be conducted with searches of the bibliographic databases Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO, from inception to 7 February 2023. Studies will be included if they are clinical trials of CST, use the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (gold-standard measure of cognition in dementia in clinical trials) and include participants with mild-to-moderate dementia. Following harmonisation of the data-set, mixed-effect models will be constructed to explore the relationship between the prognostic indicators and change scores post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first individual patient data meta-analyses on CST, and has the potential to significantly optimise patient care. Previous analyses suggest people with advanced dementia could benefit more from CST treatment. Given that CST is currently used post-diagnosis in people with mild-to-moderate dementia, the implications of confirming this finding, among identifying other prognostic indicators, are profound."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Access to psychosocial interventions for people with dementia, such as Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), has been restricted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some services have shifted to provision via videoconferencing, but the prevalence of this is unknown. This audit aimed to understand provision of virtual CST (vCST) within National Health Service (NHS) memory clinics throughout the UK and Channel Islands and investigate plans for ongoing CST provision. A cross-sectional survey was circulated to NHS memory clinics, which included closed and open-ended questions to generate quantitative and qualitative data. Thirty-three memory clinics responded to the survey. During the pandemic, 55% of respondents offered vCST, whereas 45% offered no CST. Of those offering vCST, 80% plan to continue with a hybrid model of separate face-to-face and vCST groups, whilst 20% intend to deliver face-to-face CST only. Reported positive aspects of vCST were participant and staff enjoyment, perceived improved digital confidence in participants, and improved accessibility for those who cannot attend face-to-face groups. Negative aspects related to digital poverty, limited digital literacy, support needed from carers, the impact of sensory impairment on engagement, and staff time commitment. Virtual CST has been a feasible alternative to face-to-face services during the pandemic but should not completely replace in-person groups. A hybrid approach would increase accessibility for all. Future research should explore efficacy of vCST and seek to understand patterns of exclusion from such digital interventions.

Some therapeutic strategies such as cognitive stimulation and psychotherapy have been suggested to mitigate loss of awareness. Nevertheless, evidence of intervention improving awareness of deficits is scarce. The present study aims to explore the impact of a Brazilian adapted version of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST-Brasil), an evidence-based psychosocial intervention for people with dementia (PwD), on the level of awareness, reporting here a secondary outcome of a pilot randomized controlled trial. METHODS: 47 people with mild to moderate dementia attending an out-patient unit were randomly allocated to CST (n = 23) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 24) across 7 weeks, in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Awareness was measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Results indicated that people in both groups increased in overall awareness of the disease, but only those receiving CST exhibited improvements of awareness of cognitive ability. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CST may also improve metacognitive abilities in PwD, which could potentially be applied to other settings with beneficial effects. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Considering the negative impacts of anosognosia, CST-led improvements in awareness have the potential to benefit PwD and their caregivers.",

      "abstract": "The awareness and utilization of psychological therapies for Alzheimer's disease have increased significantly in recent years. Limitations on the utilization of pharmacological therapy for Alzheimer's disease in China have corresponded with this surge in greater studies in the field. For individuals who have Alzheimer's disease, cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a quick self-help that is founded on the theories of quality and cognitive functioning. People with Alzheimer's disease often participate in cognitive behavioral programs; however, their expense has never been studied. Being part of a meta-analysis, we analyze the application effectiveness of a CST program that is based on recent research for Alzheimer's disease patients. A CST group therapy was given to 91 Alzheimer's patients, who resided in healthcare settings or the general public, multiple times per week for 8 weeks; the other 70 people with Alzheimer's disease got a medical therapy. Costs were computed, and resource utilization was tracked for 8 weeks both before and after the therapy. It was determined by a value study. In the value study, cognition and quality of life were the major and tertiary outcomes, respectively. Contours of cost-effectiveness and acceptance were drawn. It was driven based on expert consultation and semistructured interviews. In Alzheimer's disease, CST improves intelligence and standard of living, and there was no difference in implementation expenditures between the categories. Regarding both outcome metrics, there is a significant chance that CST seems to be more expensive than conventional therapy within realistic expectations. The efficacy of CST for Alzheimer's patients is superior to conventional treatment, and it could be the greater value. The outcomes contrast well with pharmacological studies for Alzheimer's. Many people with Alzheimer's disease may benefit significantly from CST groups.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions such as Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) have been shown to help persons living with dementia in improving cognitive function and recall. While previous CST interventions have been conducted largely with community populations, none have explored the outcomes of CST in larger healthcare settings. Our study explored differences of cognitive function, mood, and quality-of-life from CST groups both community and residential-based groups. METHOD: Participants (N = 258) from academic and rural, hospital-based settings in Missouri engaged in 14-session psychosocial groups to aid reminiscence for enhanced cognitive function and recall. RESULTS: Post-intervention cognitive function improvements occurred for community (t = -7.48, p < .001) and residential samples (t = -2.46, p < .05). Community groups showed significant improvement in overall mood related to their dementia (t = 6.37, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers should consider CST as a supplemental intervention for older patients receiving usual care for dementia-related symptoms.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many scholars have explored the effect of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) on dementia patients, however, due to different experimental designs and insufficient sample sizes, research results are inconsistent. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of high-quality quantitative results. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of CST for improving cognition, quality of life (QoL) and neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia (PwD). METHODS: Chinese and English databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between establishment of and April 2022, with another search done in May 2022. Finally, 10 studies on the application of CST in PwD for improving cognition, QoL, behavior, language and activities of daily living were reviewed. RESULTS: Based on the results of the 10 RCTs, CST significantly improved cognitive performance (MMSE: WMD = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.24-2.72, P<0.01), QoL (WMD = 3.12, 95% CI: 2.52-3.72, P<0.01), language (NLT: WMD = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.07-4.35, P<0.01) and activities of daily living (DAD: WMD = 7.27, 95% CI: 0.97-13.56, P<0.01) in PwD. However, no significant improvements in ADAS-Cog (WMD = 0.55, 95% CI: -3.04-4.14, P = 0.76), depression (SMD = -0.12,95% CI: -0.29-0.04, P = 0.15), anxiety (RAID: WMD = -1.05, 95% CI: -3.85-1.75, P = 0.46) or neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI: WMD = 0.23, 95% CI: -2.62-3.07, P = 0.88) were found. CONCLUSION: CST improved the cognitive ability, QoL, language and activities of daily living of PwD. However, the effect of neuropsychiatric symptoms on PwD requires further exploration.",

This study explored the feasibility of CST delivery by an occupational therapist in an Ontario health care setting and the impact it may have on self-efficacy and hope measures of individuals with dementia. Methods. A mixed-methods experimental pre/post design was used. Survey measures included hope, self-efficacy, feasibility, satisfaction, and individual session evaluation. Semistructured focus groups were held for participants and facilitators. Findings. Quantitative findings are summarized descriptively for the 10 participants. Qualitative findings were grouped into themes: social connectedness, knowledge gained and shared, tailored implementation adjustments, and need for long-term programing. Implications. Occupational therapists are well-positioned to implement CST and should be a part of further research to test the intervention rigorously for applicability within a range of Canadian health care settings.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment can represent a predecessor to neuro-degenerative processes; however, evidence suggests that non-pharmacologic interventions such as reminiscence therapy (RT) and cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) can potentially stabilize or reverse this trend. Community-based settings are widely regarded as the key area of intervention by healthcare professionals in this field. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effects of an RT and a CST program in the cognition, depressive symptomatology, and quality of life (QoL) of older adults with cognitive decline who attend community support structures (CSS) in central Portugal. A quasi-experimental study with two arms (RT and CST program) was conducted for seven weeks. Participants were allocated to each arm based on the CSS they attended. Of the 109 older adults initially screened, 76 completed the intervention (50 in the RT program and 26 in the CST program). A pre- and post-intervention analysis showed statistically significant differences in older adults' cognition, especially in their delayed recall ability, in both groups. Older adults in the RT program evidence improved QoL scores post-intervention. Both the RT and CST programs implemented throughout the study are beneficial to older adults' cognitive performance, although results are more pronounced in the earlier stages of cognitive decline. Participation in the RT program was associated with improvements in older adults' QoL scores."

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many existing CST groups moved virtually and this required carers of people living with dementia to assist with setting up the appropriate technology. This study aimed to explore the roles and experiences of carers in accessing virtual CST (vCST). METHODS: This qualitative study used semi-structured individual interviews, via telephone or videoconference, to explore the roles and experiences of carers. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Twelve family carers (age: 51-75 years) reported a range of experiences, from novice to expert knowledge in terms of accessing digital devices (mainly laptops and iPads) and connecting to Zoom. Accessing vCST provided carers an immediate application of new knowledge. Carers reported positive responses to vCST that provided their family member living with dementia with social contact and cognitive stimulation during lockdown. CONCLUSION: Accessing vCST required carers to have an existing adequate level of technological competence in order to learn and use the Zoom platform. Adult learning principles can be used to improve carers' digital literacy required for vCST and other telehealth initiatives.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a lack of digital resources that support the cognition and quality of life (QoL) of people with dementia. The individual cognitive stimulation therapy application (iCST app) aims to provide cognitive stimulation and social interaction to people with dementia and carers through interactive touch-screen technology. This study set out to determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the iCST app. METHODS: This was a single blind, feasibility RCT including people with mild to moderate dementia and their carers. Multiple trial components were assessed including recruitment and retention rates, intervention fidelity and usability, and acceptability of the outcome assessments which included measures of cognition and QoL. A sample of the intervention group was invited to a semi-structured post-trial interview to examine the experience of using the iCST app. RESULTS: Sixty-one dyads were randomised to the iCST app (n = 31) or treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group (n = 30) for 11 weeks. In the iCST app group, 77% used the intervention for 20 minutes or more each week. Carers using the iCST app rated their QoL better at follow-up 2 compared to the TAU control group (EQ-5D, MD = 7.69, 95% CI = 2.32-13.06, p = 0.006). No significant differences were found on the other outcome measures. CONCLUSION: The iCST app was deemed usable and enjoyable. Most participants completed the activities more quickly than anticipated and did not have enough activities to continue using the app frequently. Expansion of the iCST app is needed to maintain engagement for longer. Findings indicate that computerised cognitive stimulation can be beneficial, and a large-scale RCT is feasible with modifications to trial components. The results are relevant to researchers, software developers, policy-makers, people with dementia and carers who are looking to be involved in such interventions.

METHODS: The vCST protocol was developed using the existing group CST manual, through stakeholder consultation with people living with dementia, caregivers, CST group facilitators and dementia service managers. This protocol was then field-tested with 10 groups of people living with dementia in the Brazil, China (Hong Kong), India, Ireland and the UK, and feedback on the protocol was gathered from 14 facilitators. RESULTS: Field testing in five countries indicated acceptability to group facilitators and participants. Feedback from these groups was used to refine the developed protocol. The final vCST protocol is proposed, including session materials for delivery of CST over videoconferencing and a framework for offering CST virtually in global settings. CONCLUSION: vCST is a feasible online intervention for many people living with dementia. We recommend that it is offered to those unable to access traditional in-person CST for health reasons, lack of transport or COVID-19 restrictions. Further research is needed to explore if participant outcomes are comparable to in-person CST groups.",

The revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate the pooled effects of CST. Stata 16.0 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included. Overall, CST increased cognitive function (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66 to 1.28) and decreased depression (SMD: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.04).

Materials and Methods: Data were drawn from a sample (N = 123) of people with dementia (PwD) who took part in a multicenter controlled clinical trial of CST-IT. Assessments at pre-test, immediately after completing the treatment, and 3 months later investigated the following outcomes: general cognitive functioning and language, mood and behavior, everyday functioning, and quality of life. Age, education and baseline (pre-test) cognitive functioning, mood (depression) and behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms were considered as predictors of any short- and long-term benefits. Results: Linear mixed-effects models showed that different individual characteristics -particularly education and age- influenced the benefits of CST-IT, depending on the outcome measures considered. Higher education predicted larger gains in general cognitive functioning and, along with less severe depressive symptoms, in language (magnification effects). Older age was associated with positive changes in mood (compensation effects). Albeit very modestly, older age was also associated with larger gains in everyday functioning (compensation effects). Gains in quality of life were predicted by older age and lower education (compensation effects). Baseline cognitive functioning, mood and/or behavioral symptoms broadly influenced performance too, but their role again depended on the outcomes considered. Discussion: These findings underscore the importance of considering and further exploring how psychosocial interventions like CST are affected by individual characteristics in order to maximize their efficacy for PwD."

A trend towards improvement was also identified in short term/working memory and perceived quality of life (Quality of life (QoL) of elderly with dementia). The primary caregivers also perceived an improvement in mood, stress, anxiety and quality of sleep after the start of the virtual therapy during COVID-19 isolation. CONCLUSION: The present results support the efficacy of cognitive stimulation virtual therapy CSVT program in people with dementia during COVID-19 isolation."

DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the differences among 3 different settings of CST or a control group in treating people with dementia. METHODS: Relevant electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library for clinical trials, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data were systematically searched from inception to March 2021. RCTs that compared the differences among 3 different settings of CST or a control group in treating people with dementia were included. Then, a pairwise and network meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relative effects and rank probability of different CST settings. PRISMA guidelines were used for abstracting data, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess data quality. RESULTS: In total, 17 studies were included, which enrolled 1680 participants. Compared with the control group, MSCT [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.39, 95% CI 0.86, 1.91; low-quality evidence] and group CST (SMD 0.62, 95% CI 0.39, 0.84; very low-quality evidence) could significantly improve cognitive function. MCST (SMD 1.00, 95% CI 0.16, 1.85; low-quality evidence) and group CST (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.13, 0.92; low-quality evidence) demonstrated a statistically significant effect in improving the QoL, whereas iCST was not significantly inferior to the control condition. None of the treatments were significantly different from each other with respect to acceptability. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: For people with dementia, group CST and MCST seems to promote more consistent benefits in terms of cognition and QoL than the iCST, and MCST was likely to be the most effective CST setting. Further RCTs with respect to the MCST and iCST efficacy are needed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is one of the few non-pharmacological interventions for people living with dementia shown to be effective and cost-effective. What are the current and future cost and health-related quality of life implications of scaling-up CST to eligible new cases of dementia in England? METHODS/DESIGN: Data from trials were combined with microsimulation and macrosimulation modelling to project future prevalence, needs and costs. Health and social costs, unpaid care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared with and without scaling-up of CST and follow-on maintenance CST (MCST). RESULTS: Scaling-up group CST requires year-on-year increases in expenditure (mainly on staff), but these would be partially offset by reductions in health and care costs. Unpaid care costs would increase. Scaling-up MCST would also require additional expenditure, but without generating savings elsewhere. There would be improvements in general cognitive functioning and health-related quality of life, summarised in terms of QALY gains. Cost per QALY for CST alone would increase from £12,596 in 2015 to £19,573 by 2040, which is below the threshold for cost-effectiveness used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Cost per QALY for CST and MCST combined would grow from £19,883 in 2015 to £30,906 by 2040, making it less likely to be recommended by NICE on cost-effectiveness grounds. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling-up CST England for people with incident dementia can improve lives in an affordable, cost-effective manner. Adding MCST also improves health-related quality of life, but the economic evidence is less compelling.",

Despite consistent evidence of clinical efficacy, the cognitive and brain mechanisms of CST remain unclear. Theoretically, group CST as a person-centred approach may work through promoting social interaction and personhood, executive function, and language use, especially in people with higher brain/cognitive reserve. To explore these putative mechanisms, structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 16 people with mild dementia before and after receiving CST, and in 13 dementia controls who received treatment as usual (TAU). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analyses were performed. Compared with TAU, the CST group maintained the total brain volume/total intracranial volume (TBV/TICV) ratio. Increased rs-FC in the default mode network (DMN) in the posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral parietal cortices nodes was observed in the CST over TAU groups between pre- and post-intervention timepoints. We provided preliminary evidence that CST maintains/enhances brain reserve both structurally and functionally. Considering the role of DMN in episodic memory retrieval and mental self-representation, preservation of personhood may be an important mechanism of CST for further investigation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is increasing awareness of the benefits of both physical and psychosocial interventions to empower and benefit people with dementia and their caregivers. However, the potential additional benefits of combining physical and psychosocial interventions have only been sparsely explored. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the acceptability and potential impact of a multicomponent intervention comprising physical exercise, cognitive stimulation therapy (CST), psychoeducation and counselling for people with early-stage dementia. DESIGN: A 15-week multicomponent group-based intervention was offered to people with early-stage dementia in Denmark (N = 44). A mixed-methods design combining interviews, observations, tests of cognitive and physical functioning and an interviewer-assisted questionnaire on quality of life was applied to (1) investigate acceptability of the intervention, including whether people with dementia and their caregivers found the intervention meaningful and (2) to explore and assess changes in participants' physical and cognitive functioning and quality of life. The study was conducted between June 2018 and August 2019. RESULTS: The pilot study demonstrated that the multicomponent intervention was acceptable for people with early-stage dementia and their caregivers. Test results did not show significant changes in measures of participants' physical and cognitive functioning or quality of life. However, qualitative data revealed that participants perceived the intervention as meaningful and found that it had a positive influence on their physical and social well-being. In addition, interaction and support from peers and staff members was considered important and rewarding. CONCLUSION: This multicomponent intervention constitutes a meaningful and beneficial activity for people with early-stage dementia and their caregivers. It provides an opportunity to engage in social interactions with peers and experience professional support. The study also underlines the importance of providing prolonged and sustainable interventions for people with dementia to maintain personal and social benefits.",

A touch-screen individualised CST (iCST) application has been developed to improve on accessibility and provide increased interactivity. This study aimed to explore the attitudes of people with dementia, carers and healthcare professionals in Indonesia towards the iCST application and related technology. METHODS: Four focus groups were organised: one comprising family carers (n = 3), two comprising people with dementia and family carers (n = 12) and one made up of family carers and home care workers (n = 3). Participants discussed the uses of technology, tried out the iCST application and completed a usability and acceptability questionnaire. Furthermore, 21 healthcare professionals attended an expert meeting to discuss the potential of implementing the iCST application in the community. RESULTS: Attitudes towards technology were positive but lack of experience, difficulties with operating devices and a limited infrastructure to support technology were described as barriers. The iCST application was seen as an interesting tool to support mental stimulation. Compared with people with dementia, carers were more willing to use the application and rated its usability higher. Healthcare professionals were positive about the interactive features of the application and judged that it could be useful within the family context. DISCUSSION: Low-cost and low-infrastructure technology like iCST can meet the needs for stimulation of people with dementia in Indonesia and other countries. By understanding the attitudes of people with dementia and carers towards IT and their willingness to adopt technology like the iCST application, we are better placed to overcome potential obstacles to its implementation. It appears that systemic changes are needed to facilitate wider use of IT particularly in dementia care. These include needs to empower end users, strengthen access and connectivity to technology, and improve diagnostic support.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a need for more resources to support the cognition and quality of life of people with dementia. The individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) app aims to provide cognitive stimulation and social interaction to people with dementia and carers through interactive touchscreen technology. The iCST app has been developed according to the principles of CST and iCST, which have previously shown to improve the cognition and quality of life of people with dementia and benefit the relationship between the person with dementia and his/her carer. The iCST app has also shown to improve the quality of the carer's life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of the iCST app intervention and the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the clinical effectiveness of the iCST app intervention compared to that of treatment-as-usual for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. METHODS: We aim to recruit 60 people with mild-to-moderate dementia and their informal carers as dyads in a multi-center feasibility RCT with a treatment-as-usual control group. Both parties must be able to provide informed consent and participate in the intervention. Dyads will complete a baseline assessment that will include cognition and quality of life measures and they will subsequently be randomized (1:1) to the iCST app intervention in addition to usual care or to usual care only. All participants will be followed up at 5 weeks and at 11 weeks after the baseline assessments. A range of feasibility outcomes will be assessed, including recruitment and retention rates, intervention fidelity and usability, and acceptability of the outcome measures. A sample of the experimental group will be invited to a semistructured posttrial interview to further examine the experience of using the iCST app. RESULTS: This study received funding in May 2015 and obtained ethical approval in March 2018. Data collection began in November 2018 and was completed in March 2020 with a total of 61 dyads recruited. Data analyses are in progress and the final results are expected to be available in the spring of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will investigate whether it is feasible to conduct a full-scale RCT to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the iCST app in comparison to that of usual care alone. In addition, this study will examine the usability of the iCST app. The data will provide information on potential modifications to be made to the intervention, study design, and study process.

Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a group-based psychological treatment for people with dementia (PwD), shown to improve cognition and quality of life (QoL). It has previously been culturally adapted and piloted in Tanzania, shown to produce similar outcomes. UK research into CST suggests processes inherent to the group nature are key to its success. This study sought to identify group processes within CST in Tanzania and understand their impact on CST principles and outcomes. METHODS: Data collection took place in rural Hai District, through qualitative semi-structured interviews. Sixteen PwD and four facilitators were recruited through convenience sampling and interviewed about their experiences of CST. Interviews were audio-recorded, translated, transcribed and analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two main themes emerged: 'Positive group experiences' and 'Negative group experiences'. From this, a number of group processes were identified, such as helping behaviours and feeling understood by the group. Positive processes supported CST principles and participant improvement. Facilitators were influential over group dynamics. The group processes identified impacted CST principles and treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on group mechanisms of CST in Tanzania. It provides deeper insight into participants' experiences of CST, thus identifying specific processes underlying the quantitatively measured positive outcomes of CST in Tanzania by previous studies. It also reveals further cultural barriers to implementation, enabling amendments for optimization of treatment efficacy.",

The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness in the short- and long-term (on completing the treatment and 3 months later) of an Italian adaptation of the CST protocol (CST-IT). METHOD: Older adults with mild-to-moderate dementia at 16 residential care homes were randomly assigned to a CST-IT group (N = 123) or an active control group (N = 102). The following domains were examined for potential benefits: general cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale [ADAS-Cog]), language (Narrative Language Test), mood and behavior (Cornell scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory), everyday life functioning (Disability Assessment for Dementia), and quality of life (Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease scale). RESULTS: At both the short- and long-term assessments, the CST-IT group's MMSE scores remained stable, while the control group's scores decreased slightly from pretest to posttest and at follow-up. The CST-IT group also had short-term benefits in other cognitive measures (ADAS-Cog and Narrative Language Test) and mood and behavior measures, which were generally maintained at follow-up. No other differences were observed. DISCUSSION: The effectiveness of CST in sustaining cognitive and emotional functioning, and counteracting the progression of behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia was confirmed, and a long-term benefit was demonstrated. CST is a promising option for the treatment of people with dementia in clinical practice.",

METHOD: We aimed to recruit forty dyads (carer and individual with dementia and ID) who were randomised to iCST or a waiting list control group. Both groups received treatment as usual. Family and paid carers delivered the manualised intervention (40 sessions over 20 weeks). Recruitment and retention of participants, intervention adherence, fidelity and acceptability were assessed. Outcome measures of cognition, adaptive functioning, quality of life (QoL) and carer outcomes were collected at baseline, midpoint (11 weeks) and at 21 weeks. Qualitative interviews were conducted with six carers about their experience of iCST. RESULTS: Forty dyads were recruited over 10 months from 12 National Health Service trusts. One dyad dropped out and 87.5% and 97.5% completed the midpoint and end-point assessments respectively. Assessment of fidelity indicated that the correct session structure was not followed; 70% completed at least 20 sessions and there was a high level of satisfaction with iCST. QoL was significantly higher in the iCST arm at 21 weeks (adjusted mean difference: 3.11; 95% CI: 0.64 to 5.58). There were no differences in the other outcome measures. CONCLUSION: The intervention was feasible and acceptable.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a lack of technological resources for the mental stimulation and communication of people with dementia, which can be helpful in improving cognition and quality of life. Paper-based individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) for people with dementia has the potential to be adapted to a touchscreen format. This can improve accessibility and provide mental stimulation using interactive features. There is a need for a rigorous and systematic approach toward development, leading to improved suitability and implementation of the intervention, so that more people can benefit from its use. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and investigate the usability of Thinkability, an iCST app that can be used by people with dementia and carers on touchscreen tablets. METHODS: The Medical Research Council framework for evaluating complex interventions and the Centre for eHealth Research roadmap served as frameworks for the stages of intervention and technology development. The development of the iCST app itself adopted an agile approach with elements from action research. Hence, it was developed in 3 successive sprints and was evaluated by relevant stakeholders at each sprint. Sprint 1 included 2 patient and public involvement (PPI) consultation meetings, sprint 2 included 1 PPI consultation meeting, and 4 focus groups and 10 individual interviews were organized in sprint 3. A feasibility trial is currently underway. RESULTS: The findings from each sprint were used to inform the development. Sprint 1 helped to identify the relevant evidence base and explored the attitudes of people with dementia and carers toward a potential iCST app. In sprint 2, an initial prototype was evaluated in a small PPI consultation meeting. In sprint 3, feedback was gathered through a qualitative study on the quality and perceived effectiveness of the iCST app. It was well received by people with dementia and carers. A need for more updated and personalized content was highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: This study proves that an agile approach toward technology development involving all relevant stakeholders is effective in creating suitable technology. Adding to our previous knowledge of noncomputerized cognitive stimulation therapy, the release of the iCST app will make this psychosocial intervention accessible to more users worldwide."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dementia is a persistent, progressive state of cognitive decline against which pharmacological intervention has a modest efficacy, reducing behavioral but not cognitive symptoms. Therefore, different non-pharmacological therapies have been developed; the most scientifically recognized are cognitive therapies that have improved cognitive function and daily life activities. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent cognitive stimulation therapy (SADEM) on cognitive and behavioral function and daily life activities in patients with mild stage dementia. METHODS: Controlled clinical trial with pre- and post-intervention (12 months) and follow-up (24 months after) evaluations. Participants (67) diagnosed with mild dementia were randomly assigned to intervention group (n = 39) or control group (n = 28). The intervention took place throughout one year and consisted of two weekly 90-minute sessions and one more a year after a monthly follow-up. Instruments were used to evaluate outcomes in cognitive, behavioral, and affective domains. RESULTS: The results showed statistically significant differences, with improvement in the cognitive outcomes and the Dementia Index post-intervention (p = 0.01). No progression of the disease was observed at the end of the study. CONCLUSION: The multicomponent intervention tested had positive effects on cognitive and behavioral functions and daily life activities in people with mild stage dementia, delaying progression for at least two years.",

The primary outcome measure was cognition and secondary measures were quality of life, communication, autonomy, anxiety, depression, and global functioning. We also explored whether CST benefits people differently according to context, gender and level of cognitive reserve. RESULTS: Fifty-five people were randomized to the intervention and 57 to the control group. In the post-test, the intervention group significantly improved relative to controls in cognition (ADAS-Cog, p = 0.013), communication (HCS, p = 0.045), behaviour (CAPE-BRS, p = 0.017) and in global dementia rating (CDR, p = 0.008). Quality of life, depression and anxiety had no significant differences. The estimated number needed to treat was four for one to benefit a cognitive improvement (ADAS-Cog).

It is estimated to affect around 200,000 people in Portugal. There is a clear need for non-pharmacological interventions to ameliorate the symptoms of dementia and improve the quality of life. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), a worldwide well-known program developed in the United Kingdom (UK), is recognized as a cost-effective intervention, with benefits both in cognitive function and quality of life of people with mild to moderate dementia. We tested the feasibility and cultural appropriateness and adapted CST to Portuguese people with dementia. METHODS: The Formative Method for Adapting Psychotherapy (FMAP) model for cultural adaptation was used. A focus group discussion with health professionals and caregivers provided the basis for cultural adaptation, as well as feedback from participants, caregivers, and facilitators after a pilot study. RESULTS: Some modifications were required, especially related to linguistic issues, in 11 of the 14 CST sessions. The adapted program was found to be acceptable and enjoyable in a small sample of people with dementia in a rehabilitation context. CONCLUSIONS: CST seems feasible and culturally appropriate in Portugal. A systematically developed and culturally adapted manual is ready to be used in a large-scale implementation and validation of CST in Portugal. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: CST is a valid program for the Portuguese culture, contributes to the availability of a structured and effective clinical intervention for PwD in Portugal and to the possibility of comparing programs across countries.",

It is widely implemented in National Health Service (NHS) settings, but little is known about its naturalistic use. The aim of this survey was to identify and explore inclusion criteria, dose and quality of CST across services in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).Methods: All NHS memory clinics and services for people with dementia were contacted and asked to complete a mixed methods online survey on CST delivery in their service. Questions were centred on who provided CST, who received CST, the dose of CST and any outcomes that were routinely measured.Results: A total of 57/186 services responded, giving a response rate of 30.7%. While the majority reported offering CST (87.7%), there was variability in how this was delivered. Differing inclusion criteria included the use of varying cognitive and behavioural outcome measures, and CST was reported as being offered once and twice weekly. Services also differed in how they evaluated the quality of CST and how this evidence was incorporated for future sessions.Conclusion: While there was a low response rate, this survey indicates that there is significant variability in how CST is used in clinical practice, with many trusts not adhering to the evidence base. To ensure that people with dementia are consistently offered evidence-based, high-quality CST across NHS settings, further standardisation of inclusion criteria, dose and outcomes is needed.",

Psychosocial interventions are recognized as useful tools to improve cognitive and behavioral difficulties, as well as quality of life of people with dementia (PwD) and their caregivers. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is an evidence-based psychosocial intervention, recommended and implemented in many countries. In Brazil, there is no validated psychosocial intervention for dementia care. The present study aims to explore feasibility and obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of CST-Brasil in a sample of 47 people with mild to moderate dementia attending an outpatient unit. METHODS: A single-blind design was used, with participants being randomly allocated to either 14 sessions of CST + treatment as usual (TAU; n = 23) or TAU (n = 24) during 7 weeks. Changes in cognition, quality of life, depressive symptoms, caregiver burden and functionality were measured. RESULTS: PwD receiving CST and their family caregivers expressed good acceptance of the intervention, with low attrition and high attendance. Participants receiving CST exhibited significant improvements in mood and in activities of daily living compared to TAU. There were no significant effects in cognition, quality of life and caregiver burden. CONCLUSIONS: CST-Brasil proved to be a feasible and useful intervention to improve mood in PwD, with high acceptance between study participators. CST-Brasil is a promising psychosocial intervention for dementia and should be explored in other clinical settings to allow generalization to a wider Brazilian context.",

For disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, access to evidence-based interventions beyond research settings is of great importance. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a brief, group-based intervention, with consistent evidence of effectiveness. Methods: An implementation focused, three-phase methodology was developed using extensive stakeholder engagement. The methods resulted in a standardized Implementation Plan for the successful translation of CST from research to practice. The methodology was developed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and refined in three countries that vary in levels of economic development and healthcare systems (Brazil, India and Tanzania). Results: Five Implemention Plans for CST were produced. Each plan contained implementation strategies and action plans devised in conjunction with policy professionals, healthcare professionals, people with dementia and family carers, and an international team of researchers and clinicians. Conclusion: This novel methodology can act as a template for implementation studies in diverse healthcare systems across the world. It is an effective means of devising socio-culturally informed Implementation Plans that account for economic realities, health equity and healthcare access.",

METHODS: Student participants (SPs) were recruited over five semesters to create and deliver iCST sessions to geriatric participants (GPs) for 10 weeks. Likert scale survey items and open-ended questions were used to evaluate the success of the SPs. Pre- and post-Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) exam and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) scores were obtained and a paired t-test determined whether the novel iCST model significantly improved GPs' cognition and/or quality of life. RESULTS: Thirty SPs and 10 GPs successfully completed the pilot course and iCST intervention. Ninety-three percent of all SPs rated the course positively and 100% felt the course was relevant to their future careers. The iCST model also yielded positive results, including a 3.8-point increase in quality of life for the GP, as measured by the QOL-AD (p = .01). SLUMS scores increased by 1.3-points, although failing to reach statistical significance (p = .25).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People living with dementia (PLwD) have a high fall risk as cognitive impairment compromises control of gait and balance. Fall prevention exercises that are effective in healthy older adults may not work for PLwD. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) has been shown to improve global cognition in PLwD. A programme which combines cognitive (CST) with physical exercises may reduce falls in PLwD. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of undertaking a full scale randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of CogEx in decreasing falls in PLwD. Specific objectives included recruitment strategy, data collection, outcome measures, intervention fidelity and facilitator/participant experience. METHODS: A mixed methods feasibility randomised controlled trial recruited people from residential aged care. Inclusion criteria were ≥ 65 years old, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 10 to 26 and able to participate in a group. Participants were randomised to CST or CST combined with strength and balance exercises (CogEx). Both CST and CogEx groups were for an hour twice a week for 7 weeks. Descriptive statistics were used to report pre- and post-intervention outcome measures (MoCA, Geriatric Depression Scale-15, Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 11, Brief Balance Evaluation Systems Test and Short Form Physical Performance Battery) and attendance. Qualitative analysis of participant focus groups and facilitator interviews used a conventional approach. Sessions were video recorded and exercise completion documented. RESULTS: Thirty-six residents were screened with 23 participants randomised to intervention (CogEx, n = 10) or control (CST, n = 13). The assessments took 45 min to 1.5 h, and there was repetition between two cognitive measures. Ten facilitators completed training with the manualised programme. Exercises were combined into the hour-long CST session; however, limited balance training occurred with participants exercising predominantly in sitting. The facilitators felt the participants engaged more and were safer in sitting. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that while fall prevention exercises could be scheduled into the CST structure, the fidelity of the combined programme was poor. Other components of the study design need further consideration before evaluation using a randomised controlled trial is feasible.

METHOD: A total of twenty-one semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted across four separate groups delivered in London, the East Midlands, South West and South East of England; including two CST and two MCST groups. Group members with mild to moderate dementia and facilitators from these groups were interviewed. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data using NVivo software. RESULTS: The final analysis identified six themes: 'benefits and challenges of group expression', 'importance of companionship and getting to know others, 'togetherness and shared identity', 'group entertainment', 'group support' and 'cognitive stimulation through the group'. The inter-connecting relationship between these themes are synthesised and summarised. CONCLUSION: Findings support the notion that therapeutic advantages inherent to the group format exist in group-based CST. New insights into the challenges related to a group format are also highlighted and discussed. Future research may benefit from exploring the relationship between the identified experiences of group interactions and clinical outcomes.",

Past research includes development of a longer term 'maintenance CST' and an individual CST programme. Previous reviews of CST have focused on quantitative outcomes or excluded certain formats of CST. This review aimed to fill this gap by evaluating how the voices of facilitators, carers and people with dementia in qualitative studies of CST can contribute to our understanding of its implementation and how it is experienced. METHODS: The current systematic review explored the experience and perspectives of people with dementia, facilitators and carers. Thematic Analysis was used to analyse this data, alongside guidance on synthesising qualitative findings. RESULTS: A systematic literature search retrieved 10 relevant studies using qualitative methodology. Eighteen themes were generated, which were grouped into three categories: 'Acceptability and feasibility', 'Features of CST' and 'Key outcomes'. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the only review to explore solely qualitative studies of CST. Findings provided insight into the shared features, outcomes and factors affecting implementation, and suggested theories for discrepancies between quantitative and qualitative findings in the literature. Some of the common themes were also in keeping with past reviews.",

It addressed potential limitations in previous literature of iCST and evaluated possible impact on cognition, quality of life (QoL) and positive psychology. METHOD: The 14-session iCST programme was developed using existing manuals for group and individual CST and consultation with experts in the field. Thirty-three PWD were recruited from care homes and randomly assigned to iCST (14, 45-min sessions) or treatment as usual (TAU) over seven weeks. Outcomes measures were assessed at baseline and follow-up after the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention appeared feasible with high attendance to sessions, minimal levels of attrition, and ease of recruitment. Analysis of covariance indicated significant improvements in cognition (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale) for PWD receiving iCST compared to TAU. There were no significant differences between groups on follow-up scores on the standardised Mini Mental State Examination, measures of positive psychology or self- and proxy- reported QoL. CONCLUSION: A 14-session programme of iCST delivered by professionals was feasible and acceptable to PWD and may provide benefits to cognition. A larger randomised control trial would be necessary to fully evaluate intervention impact on cognition, as well as QoL and positive psychology.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The main objective of cognitive stimulation therapies is to promote the plasticity and learning ability that the individual is still in possession of in old age and to delay the clinical manifestations of neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer-type dementia. There are variables that can mediate the benefits of the intervention, such as the cognitive reserve. AIM: To determine whether there is an interaction between the level of reserve and cognitive stimulation, and if it influences the cognitive performance of subjects with Alzheimer-type dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty subjects (age: 66-89) with Alzheimer-type dementia who attend a day centre participated in the study. A pretest-posttest controlled design was used. The pilot group took part in the intervention for six months. Patients were classified into two levels of cognitive reserve (high and low) and then a broad neuropsychological battery was applied to perform a comprehensive analysis of cognition. Pre- and post-intervention differences were analysed through a two-factor ANOVA, one with repeated measures (pre- and post-intervention scores) and another with independent measures (level of cognitive reserve). RESULTS: Interaction was found in the scores on the picture arrangement subtests (WAIS-III), failure to maintain the category and the percentage of errors in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. CONCLUSIONS: The positive effect of the interaction on the executive function has been observed, specifically in the capacities for planning and sequencing, perceptual organisation, response inhibition, logical reasoning and mental flexibility.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aims to specify the effects of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy based on Roy's adaptation model (RAM) on Alzheimer's patients' coping and adaptation skills, cognitive functions, and quality of life (QOL). DESIGN AND METHODS: This is an experimental and randomized controlled trial. Patients in the experimental group received cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) based on RAM. FINDINGS: The cognitive function level of the experimental group was found to be higher than that of the control group at the end of the measurements (performed in the 7th week); the difference was found to be statistically significant (P < .05). In the experimental group, dimensions of troubleshooting and focusing, making physical decisions, attention processing, systematizing, learning, and establishing relationships were found to be better than those of the control group after the application, and the difference was found to be statistically significant (P < .05). However, after the application, QOL of the experimental group was found to be better than that of the control group following the measurements; the difference was found to be statistically significant (P < .05). PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Psychiatric nurses should evaluate the patients using Standardize Mini-Mental Test Examination before applying RAM-based CST, and they should apply CST to early- and mid-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients at the end of the evaluation and work with groups consisting of six persons at most. Since the cognitive functions of individuals with AD decline from the first stage, coping-adaptation, and QOL levels will also be affected, so it is recommended to evaluate the cognitive functions, coping-adjustment and QOL levels of individuals before applying RAM-based CST.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In low/middle-income countries (LMICs), the prevalence of people diagnosed with dementia is expected to increase substantially and treatment options are limited, with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors not used as frequently as in high-income countries (HICs). Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a group-based, brief, non-pharmacological intervention for people with dementia that significantly improves cognition and quality of life in clinical trials and is cost-effective in HIC. However, its implementation in other countries is less researched. This protocol describes CST-International; an implementation research study of CST. The aim of this research is to develop, test, refine and disseminate implementation strategies for CST for people with mild to moderate dementia in three LMICs: Brazil (upper middle-income), India (lower middle-income) and Tanzania (low-income). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Four overlapping phases: (1) exploration of barriers to implementation in each country using meetings with stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, people with dementia and their families; (2) development of implementation plans for each country; (3) evaluation of implementation plans using a study of CST in each country (n=50, total n=150). Outcomes will include adherence, attendance, acceptability and attrition, agreed parameters of success, outcomes (cognition, quality of life, activities of daily living) and cost/affordability; (4) refinement and dissemination of implementation strategies, enabling ongoing pathways to practice which address barriers and facilitators to implementation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted for each country. There are no documented adverse effects associated with CST and data held will be in accordance with relevant legislation. Train the trainer models will be developed to increase CST provision in each country and policymakers/governmental bodies will be continually engaged with to aid successful implementation. Findings will be disseminated at conferences, in peer-reviewed articles and newsletters, in collaboration with Alzheimer's Disease International, and via ongoing engagement with key policymakers.",

METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out in three databases. The primary outcome was Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. We conducted a meta-analysis with Review Manager, version 5.3 and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration Recommendations assessment tool. RESULTS: Treatment effects from the meta-analysis showed that CST plus acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) was better than the control assessed by MMSE. In addition, the meta-analysis indicated that long-term CST was better than short-term or maintenance CST. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that the combination of CST and drug treatment for AD is effective in AD, regardless of whether short-term CST, maintenance CST, or long-term CST is used. The long-term CST appears to be more effective.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is widely used with people with dementia, but there is no evidence of its efficacy in mild cognitive impairment or dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI; PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We aimed to explore the impact of 'CST-PD', which is home-based, individualized CST adapted for this population. In a single-blind, randomized controlled exploratory pilot trial (RCT), we randomized 76 participant-dyads [PD-MCI (n = 15), PDD (n = 40), DLB (n = 21) and their care partners] to CST-PD or treatment as usual (TAU). CST-PD involves home-based cognitively stimulating and engaging activities delivered by a trained care partner. Exploratory outcomes at 12 weeks included cognition (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Evaluation; ACE-III), neuropsychiatric symptoms and function. In care partners, we assessed burden, stress and general health status. Relationship quality and quality of life were assessed in both dyad members. At 12 weeks, the ACE-III showed a nonstatistically significant improvement in the CST-PD group compared with the TAU group, although neuropsychiatric symptoms increased significantly in the former. In contrast, care partners' quality of life (d = 0.16) and relationship quality ('satisfaction', d = 0.01; 'positive interaction', d = 0.55) improved significantly in the CST-PD group, and care burden (d = 0.16) and stress (d = 0.05) were significantly lower. Qualitative findings in the CST-PD recipients revealed positive 'in the moment' responses to the intervention, supporting the quantitative results. In conclusion, care-partner-delivered CST-PD may improve a range of care-partner outcomes that are important in supporting home-based care. A full-scale follow-up RCT to evaluate clinical and cost effectiveness is warranted."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-based therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are moderately effective and not always tolerated. Tailoring psychosocial approaches in PDD and DLB may offer additional support and improve outcomes. We adapted home-based, care partner-delivered Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) for individuals with PDD or DLB and their care partners (CST-PD). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of CST-PD. METHODS: This randomised controlled trial used mixed methods, including a process evaluation. People with PDD, DLB or mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) and their care partners were randomised to 12 weeks of treatment as usual (TAU) or CST-PD. Outcomes were feasibility of the study conduct (i.e., recruitment, retention rate) and acceptability and tolerability of the intervention. Measures included rating scales, researcher field notes, therapy diaries, and exploratory clinical and care partner efficacy measures. RESULTS: The recruitment target was met with 76 consenting participant-dyads. Retention in both arms was high at over 70%. More than 90% of dyads undertook discrete sessions greater than 20 min duration, but the average number of sessions completed was lower than the recommended dose. Acceptability ratings (i.e., interest, motivation and sense of achievement) of the intervention were high. Participants reported no serious adverse events related to the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The field of psychosocial interventions for PDD and DLB is newly emerging, and we demonstrated that this type of intervention is acceptable and well tolerated. Evaluating its clinical effectiveness in a full-scale randomized controlled clinical trial is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial is a psychosocial intervention with an allocated ISRCTN number 11455062.",

Group CST is effective in reducing cognitive decline and improving quality of life in patients with dementia. There is some evidence that individual CST (iCST) may be beneficial in reducing cognitive decline. People with intellectual disability (ID) have an increased risk of dementia. However, there are no published studies of CST in people with ID and dementia. This protocol describes the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial of iCST delivered by carers to people with ID and dementia, compared with treatment as usual (TAU). The results of this study will inform the design of a future definitive randomised controlled trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The iCST intervention has been adapted for this trial. Forty dyads (individuals with ID and their carer) will be randomised to either iCST or TAU. The manualised intervention comprises 40 iCST sessions delivered by a carer for 30 min, twice a week, over 20 weeks. The primary outcome will be process measures assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial procedures. The secondary outcome will be changes in the scores of outcome measures (cognition, functional ability and quality of life in individuals with ID, and caregiver burden, competence in managing dementia, and anxiety and depression in carers). Data will be collected at baseline, 11 weeks and at 21 weeks. A process evaluation will examine adherence to iCST and will include qualitative interviews with participants to identify aspects of the intervention that were or were not successful. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical approval. The results of the study will be presented at conferences and submitted to a peer reviewed journal.

We investigate the possible issues for the implementation of CST for the Brazilian population and its cultural appropriateness. Method: Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with PwD, their caregivers and health professionals (n = 37). Data were recorded and transcribed, before being analyzed using Framework Analysis. Results: Regarding the issues for implementation of CST in the Brazilian population, two main themes emerged, 'Barriers' and 'Facilitators', along with nine subthemes. Overall, the activities and materials were seen as being appropriate for use with the Brazilian population, some minor changes were suggested. Conclusions: The results indicate that CST is appropriate for use in the Brazilian population, only some cultural adaptations are necessary. In the stakeholders' opinions, CTS intervention is needed in Brazil, due to the lack of treatment options for PwD in developing countries.",

Method: People with dementia were identified from a prevalence study in Lalupon in the south-west of Nigeria. Prior to this feasibility study CST was adapted for the setting and pilot by our team. Fourteen sessions of CST were provided over a 7-week period by a trained nurse specialist and occupational therapist. Change in quality of life was the main outcome. Results: Nine people were enrolled in CST. Significant improvements in cognitive function, quality of life (physical, psychosocial and environmental domains), physical function, neuro-psychiatric symptoms and carer burden were seen. Conclusions: CST appears to be feasible in this setting, although adaptation for low literacy levels, uncorrected visual and hearing impairment and work and social practices is needed. The clinical improvements seen were encouraging.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Research shows that cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) improves cognitive function, quality of life, and well-being of people with mild-moderate dementia. Despite consistent evidence and recommendations, CST is not routinely available in Ireland post-diagnosis. The aim of the current research was to develop and evaluate community-based CST for people with mild-moderate dementia, run by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland across four pilot sites in Ireland. METHODS: Participants with mild-moderate dementia attended once weekly CST sessions for 14 weeks. Baseline and post-intervention assessments were completed by CST participants, carers, and CST facilitators. Primary outcomes of interest for CST participants included quality of life (Quality of Life in Alzheimer Disease Scale), cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and subjective cognitive function (Memory Awareness Rating Scale-Functioning Subscale). Secondary outcomes included well-being, cognitive ability, satisfaction with cognitive performance, and engagement and confidence of CST participants; well-being of carers; and job satisfaction of facilitators. Post-intervention interviews supplemented quantitative analyses. RESULTS: In total, 20 CST participants, 17 carers, and six CST facilitators completed evaluation assessments. Results showed that CST improved participants' satisfaction with cognitive performance (p=0.002), level of engagement (p=0.046), level of confidence (p=0.026). Improvements on subjective cognitive function just fell short of significance (p=0.055). Qualitative analysis of interview data identified consistent themes of cognitive and overall benefits of CST; and provided support for quantitative data. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based CST positively impacted the lives of people with dementia and their families. This study supports prior recommendations that CST should be made routinely available to people with mild-moderate dementia, particularly in light of the lack of post-diagnostic interventions currently offered in Ireland."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This research study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an expanded cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) model that combines a CST group and tai chi on improving the cognitive ability of community-dwelling Chinese elderly with mild stage dementia (EwMD). METHOD: A randomized waitlist controlled trial design was adopted in this study. The treatment group participated in a structured CST group followed by tai chi twice a week, with a total of 14 sessions throughout the study period. The waitlist control group received treatment as usual at the initial stage and expanded CST model at a later stage. The Chinese Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) and the Chinese Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to assess the cognitive ability of EwMD in the pre- and post- treatment periods. RESULTS: At baseline, the treatment group (n = 51) and control group (n = 50) did not differ significantly in any demographic or clinical variables. Overall, the participants had a mean baseline MMSE score of 20.67 (SD = 2.30). The 2 × 2 repeated measures ANCOVA demonstrated that the treatment group was significantly more effective than the control group in improving the MMSE score (F = 12.31, p< .01) with a moderate effect size (partial eta square = .11) after controlling for group difference in age, gender, education, and having a diagnosis of dementia. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of the expanded CST model on the improvement of cognitive ability of community-dwelling EwMD. More research is needed to further investigate this intervention model across cultures and societies.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ageing of the Chinese population will drive a continued surge in dementia prevalence. Empirically tested non-pharmacological interventions developed in western cultures may be implemented in Chinese. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) that originated in the UK has proven benefits on cognition and quality of life in people with dementia. We investigated the feasibility and cultural appropriateness of CST in Hong Kong Chinese (CST-HK). METHODS: Mixed methods research was conducted following the formative method for adapting psychotherapy. A culturally adapted CST-HK, developed involving multidisciplinary stakeholders, was tested in a pilot multicentre study in people with mild dementia (n = 30) receiving community or residential care. Changes in cognition and quality of life were measured. Opinions from family caregivers and group facilitators (n = 25) were collected through focus groups and in-depth interviews for understanding the appropriateness of CST-HK. Feasibility was explored. RESULTS: After receiving CST-HK, 54% of participants achieved outcome of no cognitive deterioration, and 23% showed clinically meaningful improvement. Family caregivers and group facilitators expressed good acceptance of CST, with a low attrition (13%) and high attendance rate of CST-HK sessions (92%). Key cultural issues identified are (i) less active opinion sharing in group discussions due to conservatism/cautiousness and (ii) preference of practical activities with reward/recognition over pure discussion due to pragmatism. CONCLUSIONS: The CST-HK is feasible and culturally appropriate in Hong Kong Chinese. Further amendments can be made to ensure language use and enjoyment, with potential implications on effectiveness. We have provided a systematically developed, culturally adapted protocol for larger-scale implementation and research in Chinese populations. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Next, a value of information analysis is performed to inform decisions about future research. METHODS: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis applying seemingly unrelated regressions using data from a multicentre RCT of MCST versus treatment as usual in a population which had already received 7 weeks of CST for dementia (ISRCTN: 26286067). The findings from the cost-effectiveness analysis are used to inform a value of information analysis. RESULTS: The results are dependent upon how quality adjusted life years (QALYs) are measured. MCST might be cost-effective compared to standard treatment for those who live alone and those with higher levels of cognitive functioning. If a further RCT was to be conducted for this sub-group of the population, value of information analysis suggests a total sample of 48 complete cases for both sub-groups would be required for a two-arm trial. The expected net gain of conducting this future research is £920 million. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest that MCST may be most cost-efficient for people with dementia who live alone and/or who have higher cognition. Future research in this area is needed.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of the CST program, Italian adaptation -CST-IT-, in individuals who have vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: Older adults with mild-to-moderate VaD (N = 35) were assigned to one of two programs: one group (N = 21) attended the 14 sessions of the CST-IT program, while the other, active control group (N = 14) took part in alternative activities. The following domains were examined: cognitive functioning, quality of life, mood, behavior, functional activities of daily living. RESULTS: Compared with the active controls, the CST-IT group showed a greater improvement in general cognitive functioning after the intervention (i.e. score increase on the Mini-Mental State Examination and decrease on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale). A trend towards improvement was also identified in short-term/working memory - the backward digit span task- and perceived quality of life (Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease scale). No significant differences emerged between the two groups for the other domains considered. CONCLUSION: The present results support the efficacy of CST in people with vascular dementia."

This qualitative study explored the views and experiences of dementia care providers on the barriers and facilitators to its implementation in usual care. METHOD: Thirty four semi-structured interviews (24 participants) were conducted across four dementia care sites in the North of England; ten were follow-up interviews. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and then mapped to the Normalization Process Theory framework. RESULTS: Participants considered CST a \"good fit\" with their \"preferred\" ways of working and goals of dementia care namely the provision of person-centered services. For facilitators delivering the intervention, compared to other behavioral interventions, CST was seen to offer benefits to their work and was easy to understand as an intervention. Training in CST and seeing benefits for clients were important motivators. Time and resources were crucial for the successful implementation of CST. Participants were keen to objectively measure benefits to participants but unsure how to do this. CONCLUSIONS: CST is a cost-effective psychosocial intervention for people with dementia, recommended by national guidance. Despite our findings which show that, using the NPT framework, there are more facilitators than barriers to the implementation of CST, it is still not a standard part of post-diagnostic dementia care. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for this implementation gap in ensuring evidence-based care in translated into practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a well-established group psychosocial intervention for people with dementia. There is evidence that home-based programmes of cognitive stimulation delivered by family caregivers may benefit both the person and the caregiver. However, no previous studies have evaluated caregiver-delivered CST. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based, caregiver-led individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) program in (i) improving cognition and quality of life (QoL) for the person with dementia and (ii) mental and physical health (well-being) for the caregiver. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A single-blind, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at eight study sites across the United Kingdom. The intervention and blinded assessment of outcomes were conducted in participants' homes. Three hundred fifty-six people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers were recruited from memory services and community mental health teams (CMHTs). Participants were randomly assigned to iCST (75, 30-min sessions) or treatment as usual (TAU) control over 25 wk. iCST sessions consisted of themed activities designed to be mentally stimulating and enjoyable. Caregivers delivering iCST received training and support from an unblind researcher. Primary outcomes were cognition (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive [ADAS-Cog]) and self-reported QoL (Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease [QoL-AD]) for the person with dementia and general health status (Short Form-12 health survey [SF-12]) for the caregiver. Secondary outcomes included quality of the caregiving relationship from the perspectives of the person and of the caregiver (Quality of the Carer Patient Relationship Scale) and health-related QoL (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions [EQ-5D]) for the caregiver. Intention to treat (ITT) analyses were conducted. At the post-test (26 wk), there were no differences between the iCST and TAU groups in the outcomes of cognition (mean difference [MD] = -0.55, 95% CI -2.00-0.90; p = 0.45) and self-reported QoL (MD = -0.02, 95% CI -1.22-0.82; p = 0.97) for people with dementia, or caregivers' general health status (MD = 0.13, 95% CI -1.65-1.91; p = 0.89). However, people with dementia receiving iCST rated the relationship with their caregiver more positively (MD = 1.77, 95% CI 0.26-3.28; p = 0.02), and iCST improved QoL for caregivers (EQ-5D, MD = 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.10; p = 0.01). Forty percent (72/180) of dyads allocated to iCST completed at least two sessions per week, with 22% (39/180) completing no sessions at all. Study limitations include low adherence to the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that iCST has an effect on cognition or QoL for people with dementia. However, participating in iCST appeared to enhance the quality of the caregiving relationship and caregivers' QoL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The iCST trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (identified ISRCTN 65945963, URL: DOI 10.1186/ISRCTN65945963).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a psychosocial group-based intervention for dementia shown to improve cognition and quality of life with a similar efficacy to cholinesterase inhibitors. Since CST can be delivered by non-specialist healthcare workers, it has potential for use in low-resource environments, such as sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We aimed to assess the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of CST in rural Tanzania using a stepped-wedge design. METHODS: Participants and their carers were recruited through a community dementia screening program. Inclusion criteria were DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of mild/moderate severity following detailed assessment. No participant had a previous diagnosis of dementia and none were taking a cholinesterase inhibitor. Primary outcomes related to the feasibility of conducting CST in this setting. Key clinical outcomes were changes in quality of life and cognition. The assessing team was blind to treatment group membership. RESULTS: Thirty four participants with mild/moderate dementia were allocated to four CST groups. Attendance rates were high (85%) and we were able to complete all 14 sessions for each group within the seven week timeframe. Substantial improvements in cognition, anxiety, and behavioral symptoms were noted following CST, with smaller improvements in quality of life measures. The number needed to treat was two for a four-point cognitive (adapted Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive) improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention has the potential to be low-cost, sustainable, and adaptable to other settings across SSA, particularly if it can be delivered by non-specialist health workers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The carer-delivered individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) was developed to improve cognition and quality of life of people with dementia. This study aims to explore people with dementia and family carers' concepts of mental stimulation and experiences of participating in the iCST intervention. METHODS: A sub-sample of 23 dyads of people with dementia and their family carers who completed the iCST intervention took part in semi-structured in-depth interviews. Data were analysed using framework analysis. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged, 'Concepts of mental stimulation', 'Experiencing changes in everyday life as a result of participating in iCST' and 'Carer adherence to the intervention' along with 10 sub-themes. The overall experience of participating in iCST was described as having opportunities to engage in enjoyable mentally stimulating activities, motivation to stay active and bringing people with dementia and their carers 'together'. Family carers mentioned that finding time to do the sessions and their relatives being reluctant to engage in the activities could hinder their participation in the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: People with dementia and their family carers found iCST stimulating and enjoyable, but many had difficulty delivering all the sessions as planned. Family carers suggested that providing extra support by involving other people in delivering the intervention may help to improve adherence to the intervention. iCST may be a useful tool to encourage people with dementia and their carers to communicate.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There is evidence that Cognitive Stimulation Therapy and maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy are effective in mild to moderate dementia. There is, however, little evidence available for its implementation in practice and the impact of outreach support on the sustainability of the programme. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-one staff members were randomised from 63 dementia care settings between outreach support including an online forum, email, and telephone support, compared to usual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy control group. The primary outcome was average number of attendees to the Cognitive Stimulation Therapy and maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy programmes. RESULTS: There was no difference in average number of attendees between the intervention and usual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy control groups for the Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (p = 0.82) or the maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy programme (p = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Outreach support does not affect the average number of people with dementia attending the Cognitive Stimulation Therapy or maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy programme. Irrespective of outreach support, the programmes remain widely implemented and yield perceived benefits for people with dementia. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Past reviews have only synthesized outcomes obtained through quantitative study which does not fully represent the understanding on the acceptability and usefulness of CST. Therefore, the present review aims to integrate outcomes obtained from both quantitative and qualitative studies to provide a deeper understanding on the acceptability and usefulness of CST for older adults with dementia. Findings of literature were retrieved from searches of computerized databases in relation to CST for people with dementia. Literatures were selected according to selection criteria outlined. Results obtained in previous studies pertaining to the effects of CST were discussed in relation to variables such as cognitive function, quality of life, and family caregivers' wellbeing. The review also explores the use of CST in different cultural context, the perception on its effectiveness, and individualized CST (iCST). There is considerable evidence obtained through quantitative and qualitative studies on the usefulness and acceptability of CST for older adults with dementia. Recommendations for future research are provided to strengthen the evidence of CST's effectiveness."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) groups for people with dementia are available nationally, and internationally through voluntary organisations, memory services, and in residential care settings. However, groups may not be accessible or best suited for all. Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (iCST) has been developed to provide another means of accessing CST. METHODS: The programme was field tested by 22 dyads (carers and people with dementia). Dyads were trained in the iCST approach and provided with a manual and accompanying resources. Researchers contacted dyads weekly to provide support and gather adherence data. Quantitative feedback about each session was also collected using 'Monitoring Progress' forms. Upon completion of their allocation sessions, researchers interviewed dyads about their experience. In total, nine dyads were followed up. Inductive thematic analysis was performed on the qualitative data. The aims of field testing were to assess the feasibility of the programme, and the appropriateness of the iCST materials. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of the themes received an overall 'high' rating, and the majority of activities were classed as 'low' difficulty. Common barriers to completing sessions were; lack of time, illness, and motivation. Carers felt the manual and resources were 'good' and easy to use. Benefits of the programme for the person included; improvements in communication, mood, and alertness. The programme also gave carers insight into the person's abilities and interests, and provided a new channel of communication. Little support was needed to deliver the programme. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the iCST intervention was feasible. However, the majority of dyads completed fewer than three sessions per week. The training and support package appeared to be suitable as carers were able to deliver the intervention without intensive support. Barriers occurred largely as a result of life commitments, rather than problems with the intervention itself. This study was limited by a high loss to follow up rate. The effectiveness and cost effectiveness of iCST were investigated in a large scale randomised controlled trial (RCT). TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN65945963 Date of trial registration: 05/05/2010.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive stimulation therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention for people with dementia. Its use has been associated with substantial improvements in cognition and quality of life in studies from high-income countries, equivalent to those achieved by pharmacological treatments. Cognitive stimulation therapy may be particularly suited to low resource settings, such as sub-Saharan Africa, because it requires little specialist equipment and can be delivered by non-specialist health workers. The aim of this study was to adapt cognitive stimulation therapy for use in sub-Saharan Africa taking into account socio-cultural differences and resource implications. METHODS: Cognitive stimulation therapy is a structured programme, originally developed in the United Kingdom. Substantial adaptations were required for use in sub-Saharan Africa. The formative method for adapting psychotherapy was used as a framework for the adaption process. The feasibility of using the adapted cognitive stimulation therapy programme to manage dementia was assessed in Tanzania and Nigeria in November 2013. Further adaptations were made following critical appraisal of feasibility. RESULTS: The adapted cognitive stimulation therapy intervention appeared feasible and acceptable to participants and carers. Key adaptations included identification of suitable treatment settings, task adaptation to accommodate illiteracy and uncorrected sensory impairment, awareness of cultural differences and usage of locally available materials and equipment to ensure sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive stimulation therapy was successfully adapted for use in sub-Saharan Africa. Future work will focus on a trial of cognitive stimulation therapy in each setting."
