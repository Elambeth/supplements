      "abstract": "Effects of waterlogging (WL) stress and its mitigation by nitrate (NO3-) were investigated in a commercial cucumber hybrid line. WL resulted in a shift toward anaerobic metabolism in roots and development of adventitious roots (ARs). In WL stressed roots exodermal, extracellular H2O2 accumulation and protein nitration were detected. Shoot growth was retarded with signs of oxidative stress. Nitrate content decreased in both root and shoot. In the root WL upregulated several genes implicated in hypoxic response, including transcripts of CsRAP2.3, CsRBOHs and the CsHem3 phytoglobin genes. Nitrate supplementation restored shoot growth and mitigated oxidative stress. Fermentative metabolism was reduced in the roots. Nitrate levels increased substantially, expression of NRT1 genes was induced, supporting improved NO3- uptake and delivery. According to chemical analysis and fluorescent microscopy NO accumulated in the vascular cylinder of roots. NO depletion by cPTIO confirmed a role for NO in stress mitigation. cPTIO treatment decreased AR formation and foliar nitrate levels. It decreased protein nitration and strongly downregulated nitrate transporters' gene expression in roots. Overall, our work revealed nitrate triggered, NO mediated alleviation of WL stress in cucumber. Resolution of WL induced energy crisis in the roots by nitrate treatment was attributed to parallel effects of anaerobic respiration and AR formation. Shoot growth repression was probably alleviated by improved root functions, including elevated nitrate transport. Expression of NRT1 nitrate transporter genes was induced by nitrate, and this induction was found NO dependent in WL stressed cucumber."

      "abstract": "Textile is one of the industrial sectors producing multiple types of polluting substances, including dyes and nitrate. Lately, the realization of pollutant degradation through electrochemical treatment has been applied more commonly. However, in textile wastewater a high level of organic dyes can inhibit the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate. Hence, we construct a tandem reactor to synchronously remove the organic dyes and nitrate contaminants as well as yield the value-added ammonia product from the simulated textile wastewater. The tandem reactor shows impressive efficiency towards photocatalytic decomposing methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO) and methyl violet (MV) (~ 100%) coupled with NO3--to-NH3 conversion (maximum NH3 evolution value of 44.3 μg cm-2) under different bias potentials. Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) has been applied to understand the dyes degradation pathways. The dyes are oxidized by active species hydroxyl radicals ·OH and h+ under irradiation. The electrons are transferred to the cathode for nitrate reduction. In addition, the tandem reactor displays favorable energy consumption for the simulated textile wastewater treatment. Moreover, mung bean germination experiments were complemented for toxicity assessment of the system. This study presents a conceptual tandem reactor for the synergistic regulation of complex pollutants removal processes, highlighting the potential of photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical catalysis coupled to advance sustainable wastewater management technologies."

      "abstract": "The rechargeable Zn-nitrate battery presents a promising strategy for renewable energy conversion, ammonia production, and sewage treatment. Despite achieving excellent performance with transition metal-based electrocatalysts, the structure evolution of the electrocatalyst during Zn-nitrate battery charging/discharging and the corresponding reaction mechanism on nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) are still unclear. Inspired by the structural reconstruction in the charging process, nanoporous Co2P/CoOOH prepared by dealloying and anodic oxidation is reported as an electrocatalyst for NO3RR, achieving remarkable catalytic performance (ammonia yield rate: 1.93 mmol h-1 cm-2, Faradaic efficiency: 94.18%) with a high cathodic energy efficiency of 34.51%. Additionally, the assembled rechargeable Zn-nitrate battery delivers a power density of 31.99 mW cm-2 with a high charge-discharge stability. In-situ spectroscopy investigation reveals the generation of a Co2P/Co3O4 heterosturcture through a synergetic redox reaction involving the cobalt species and nitrate ions during NO3RR, which enhances the approach of potassium-ionized water and improves ammonia generation kinetics by regulating the NO2- and *NH2 generation. Density functional theoretical calculation further illustrates that Co2P/Co3O4 heterostructure optimizes the adsorption of the *NO intermediate and enables an energetically favorable rate-limiting *NOH formation step. The unique structural evolution and nitrate activation mode of cobalt-based heterostructure would provide new insights on designing efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and rechargeable Zn-nitrate battery."

      "abstract": "Selective four-electron mild electrochemical oxidation of benzyl alcohol to high-value-added benzoic acid is regarded as a green alternative to conventional synthesis methods under moderate conditions. Herein, we synthesize oxygen vacancy-rich amorphous/crystalline heterostructure spinel-type oxides NiCo2O4 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst by a pulse voltammetry electrochemical treatment process, which can be utilized for the anode benzyl alcohol oxidation (AOR) and cathode nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), respectively. The designed NiCo2O4-x-25/NF delivers only 1.18 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm-2, and Faraday efficiency of benzoic acid of ∼100%. The systematic studies reveal that the amorphous structure of NiCo2O4-x-25/NF generates abundant oxygen vacancies, promoting the rapid generation of active sites and intermediate species adsorption. Meanwhile, the presence of the crystalline structure accelerates electron transfer and maintains structural stability, thereby improving overall performance. Impressively, it exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for AOR coupled with NO3RR in an integrated electrolyzer, achieving a current density of 100 mA cm-2 at an applied low cell voltage of 1.38 V and maintaining superior catalytic stability, withstanding continuous electrolysis for 144 h. This work provides a facile synthesis approach for an amorphous/crystalline heterostructure with high electrocatalytic performance, holding great potential for paired electrosynthesis of value-added chemicals."

      "abstract": "Glucoraphanin (GRA) and sulforaphane (SF) are potent anticancer compounds. Understanding their accumulation mechanisms is crucial for increasing their levels in broccoli. This study aimed to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in GRA and SF accumulation and identify key genes involved in this process. Low NO concentrations were found to promote GRA and SF accumulation. Transcriptome sequencing and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified BoNIA2b, a nitrate reductase (NR) gene, as a key regulator of NO-mediated GRA and SF accumulation. Silencing BoNIA2b reduced endogenous NO levels and NR activity in hairy roots, while exogenous treatment with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) restored NO levels without affecting NR activity. Overexpression of BoNIA2b increased NO content and NR activity. Silencing BoNIA2b decreased GRA content, but SF levels remained unaffected. SNP treatment enhanced both GRA and SF accumulation, with GRA being more dependent on BoNIA2b. In BoNIA2b-overexpressing roots, both GRA and SF levels were significantly higher than in controls. Moreover, the interaction between BoNIA2b and BoMYB28 protein was confirmed through Y2H and luciferase complementation assays. These findings underscore BoNIA2b's role in NO-mediated regulation of GRA and SF accumulation in broccoli hairy roots, offering insights to enhancing the production of these anticancer compounds."

      "abstract": "Constructed wetlands are used extensively to mitigate surface runoff. While wetland treatment for nitrogen (N) has been comprehensively studied, a knowledge gap remains regarding the implications of other contaminants (e.g., pesticides, pharmaceuticals) on nitrate-N (NO3-N) removal. This study sought to fill that gap by determining the impact imidacloprid, caffeine, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), atrazine, glyphosate, and sulfate (SO42-) have on NO3-N removal rates. The contaminants were determined based on their occurrence across Kentucky surface waters in urban (imidacloprid, caffeine, and PFOS) and rural (atrazine, glyphosate, and SO42-) environments. Two constructed wetland designs, floating treatment wetlands (FTWs), and free-water surface wetlands (FWSs), were evaluated along with planted and un-planted controls, equating to 24 mesocosms. Individual contaminants in both designs inhibited the rate of NO3-N removal, while the presence of the contaminants in their mixtures decreased N removal rates in FWSs compared to FTWs. However, by the end of each trial, 72-99 % of the NO3-N was removed despite the wetland design or the presence of contaminant(s). The FWSs outperformed the FTWs earlier in the growing season (May-June) when the water temperatures were colder, while the FTWs outperformed the FWSs when the plants reached maturity (July-September). Both FTWs and FWSs observed significant removal of contaminants with 28-89 %, 63-70 %, >90 %, and >92 % removal for PFOS, caffeine, glyphosate, and atrazine, respectively. Limited removal of SO42- was observed (≤57.9 %). These findings improve our understanding of water treatment for contaminant mixtures and their impact on NO3-N removal, guiding treatment wetland design and placement."

      "abstract": "Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) presents a promising approach for sustainable water denitrification. Yet its practical implementation is hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we develop a nitrogen-doped carbon supported cobalt-copper dual-atom catalyst (CoCu-NC DAC) to significantly enhance the electro-catalytic NO3RR performance. The optimized CoCu-NC DAC demonstrates exceptional activity, achieving a faraday efficiency of 95.3 % and a high NH4+ yield rate of 2.41 mg h-1 cm-2 at -0.6 VRHE, surpassing the performance of conventional Cu/Co single-atom catalysts. In-situ analysis and density functional theory calculations confirm that the synergistic effects arising from (1) optimized electronic structure for balanced intermediate adsorption, and (2) enhanced surface H concentration facilitating NOx hydrogenation. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the DACs, but also offers a practical solution for groundwater nitrate remediation, opening new avenues for the application of atomically dispersed catalysts."

The supply of molybdenum (Mo) can increase the recovery of N by the plant due to the role of this micronutrient in the assimilation of nitrate through nitrate reductase (NR). We aimed to evaluate N metabolism and auxiliary measurements in maize as affected by combined N and Mo omission or supply under controlled conditions. Plants were grown for 28 d in a nutrient solution without Mo and N, with Mo and N, and under the omission of Mo or N. The treatments with omission received nutrients with foliar application or via nutrient solution after 28 d. Gas exchange, chlorophyll and anthocyanins indexes, and N accumulation were evaluated at 28, 35, and 44 d after transplanting (DAT). The amino acid profile was altered due to Mo and N supply to the plants, as well as the uptake and accumulation of nitrate. The highest biomass production was quantified in the positive control, supplied by the nutrient solution and later by the absence of Mo, being the foliar application inferior to this treatment. Maize biomass, with the omission of N and Mo, was 31 % lower than the supply of both nutrients. Molybdenum favors nitrate uptake by maize, mainly when supplied through the nutrient solution."

      "abstract": "Creation of a biological seal and efficient antibacterial qualities in the peri-implant environment is essential for the success of dental implants. Therefore, novel multifunctional strategies are being developed to address these issues, aiming at the simultaneous improvement of tissue integration and hindering pathological biofilm formation. In this study, we investigated the effect of tissue-promotive strontium acetate (SrAc), antibacterial silver nitrate (AgNO3), and their combination on oral soft tissue cells and an oral multispecies biofilm not only in monoculture setups but also in a three-dimensional (3D) implant-tissue-oral bacterial-biofilm model (INTERbACT model) that takes the naturally occurring interactions into account. Application of SrAc led to improved fibroblast migration in the monoculture setting, without impairment of metabolic activity, even upon additional AgNO3 administration. Notably, the combined treatment of SrAc and AgNO3 resulted in a synergistic antibacterial effect during biofilm formation as well as on early matured biofilms. Most interestingly, the antibacterial effect of the combined treatment was even further enhanced within the coculture setup leading to increased bacterial death and decreased biofilm volume. The 3D tissue in the coculture setup underwent the combined treatment with a notable rise in CCL20 and IL-1β levels. Histologically, only the AgNO3-treated groups exhibited damage to the integrity of the epithelial barrier. Therefore, the results of this study demonstrated promising dual antibacterial and tissue-integrative characteristics of combined AgNO3 and SrAc in the dental implant environment. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of considering naturally occurring tissue-bacteria interactions for reliable in vitro testing of novel implant materials."

      "abstract": "RNA degradation systems (e.g., RNA decay and RNA interference) and the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) are both essential for plant growth, development, and adaptation to stress. Although the interplay between these pathways has been recognized, the molecular mechanisms governing their coordination remain poorly understood. In this study, we revealed that mutations in the 5'-3' RNA-degrading enzyme Ethylene Insensitive 5 (EIN5) result in hypersensitivity to ABA in Arabidopsis, whereas defects in the 3'-5' RNA turnover machinery (ski mutants) do not. The ABA hypersensitivity of ein5 mutants was mitigated by mutating components of the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) pathway, including DICER-LIKE 2 (DCL2)/DCL4, RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase 1 (RDR1)/RDR6, and ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1). ABA treatment substantially increased the abundance of coding-transcript-derived small interfering RNAs (ct-siRNAs) in ein5, predominantly from two genes, Nitrate Reductase 1 (NIA1) and NIA2. Further analysis suggested that NIA1 and NIA2 negatively regulate both the ABA biosynthesis and signaling pathways. The key transcription factor Abscisic Acid Insensitive 3 (ABI3) represses SKI3 expression by directly binding to its promoter, thereby promoting the production of NIA1/NIA2-derived ct-siRNAs, leading to the ABA hypersensitivity of ein5. Conversely, ABA enhances the accumulation of EIN5 as well as DCL4 and AGO1, pointing to distinct regulation of the mRNA decay and PTGS pathways. These findings provide insight into the interplay between the ABA response and RNA degradation pathways and demonstrate the pivotal roles of NIA1 and NIA2 in plant responses to abiotic stress."

Similarly, the beneficial effects of nitrate on alcohol-induced cognitive decline and the roles of the oral microbiota merit investigation. Here we found that nitrate supplementation effectively mitigated cognitive impairment induced by chronic alcohol exposure in mice, reducing both systemic and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, nitrate restored the dysbiosis of the oral microbiota caused by alcohol consumption. Notably, removing the oral microbiota led to a subsequent loss of the beneficial effects of nitrate. Oral microbiota from donor alcohol use disordered humans who had been taking the nitrate intervention were transplanted into germ-free mice which then showed increased cognitive function and reduced neuroinflammation. Finally, we examined 63 alcohol drinkers with varying levels of cognitive impairment and found that lower concentrations of nitrate metabolism-related bacteria were associated with higher cognitive impairment and lower nitrate levels in plasma. These findings highlight the protective role of nitrate against alcohol-induced cognition impairment and neuroinflammation and suggest that the oral microbiota associated with nitrate metabolism and brain function may form part of a \"microbiota-mouth-brain axis\".",

Twenty Hanwoo steers (average body weight 348 ± 18 kg) were randomly allocated to five pens (4 head/pen) balanced for body weight, and then randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments (2 head/treatment/pen): (1) the control (CON), 500 g/kg long stem timothy hay and 500 g/kg commercial concentrates; (2) NIT, control diet top-dressed with 2.5% CAN (1.578% NO3- in the dietary DM) for 115 days in a completely randomized design. Methane measurement was performed for 3 days starting from d 21, d 51, d 80 and d 112 using whole body respiratory chambers (RC). Rumen fluid and blood samples were collected on d 25 and d 26, respectively. A decrease (P < 0.05) in dry matter intake (DMI) was observed in steers fed NIT both in the pen and RC. However, average daily gain and gain:feed were not adversely affected. Additionally, methemoglobin concentration was not influenced by the treatment, suggesting no potential toxicity of NO₃⁻ in steers fed NIT. A decrease (P < 0.05) in CH4 production (g/d) was noted in NIT throughout the feeding trial, but CH4 yield (g/kg DMI) was not different (P > 0.05) between treatments. Ruminal pH, ammonia concentration and total volatile fatty acid production were not affected by the treatment, but NIT increased and decreased (P < 0.01) acetate and butyrate proportions, respectively, compared with CON. Steers in NIT group had increased (P < 0.05) ruminal abundance of Ruminococcus sp. and a tendency for increased Succiniclasticum (P = 0.07), and Selenomonas ruminantium (P = 0.07). However, NIT decreased (P < 0.05) the abundance of Olsenella, Atopobium and tended to decrease (P = 0.07) Methanobrevibacter ruminantium in the rumen. Overall, dietary supplementation of NO₃⁻ demonstrated a potential to reduce enteric CH4 production (g/d) by an average of 25.4% in Hanwoo beef cattle over time without causing NO₃⁻ intoxication in the early stage or negatively affecting growth performance throughout the trial. However, the lack of a sustained mitigation effect on CH₄ yield (g/kg DMI) suggests that further evaluation of NO₃⁻ supplementation under different dietary conditions is necessary."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a major pathogen in hospitals, causing a notable rise in bloodstream infections among inpatients. Its growing resistance to multiple drugs limits treatment options. This study aims to examine the antibacterial effects of gallium nitrate [Ga(NO3)3] against A. baumannii and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: 40 strains of A. baumannii with different antimicrobials susceptibility patterns were isolated from bloodstream infections. The in vitro antibacterial activity of Ga(NO3)3 was analyzed by micro-dilution method and time-kill assay. The influence of ferric chloride/hemin on the antibacterial efficacy of Ga(NO3)3 was investigated. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to elucidate the antibacterial mechanism of Ga(NO3)3. A mouse infection model was conducted to assess its in vivo performance. RESULTS: Ga(NO3)3 exhibited a potent antibacterial effect in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% human serum, with MICs ranging from 0.06 μg/mL to 0.125 μg/mL. The antibacterial activity of Ga(NO3)3 was found to be dose- and time- dependent. However, the antibacterial effect of Ga(NO3)3 was partially compromised in the presence of exogenous ferric chloride/hemin. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that Ga(NO3)3 exerted its antibacterial effect by up-regulating the expression of genes associated with siderophore biosynthesis and transport, while simultaneously disrupting multiple iron-dependent metabolic processes. Ga(NO3)3 treatment significantly reduced bacterial load in vivo using a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on the antibacterial mechanisms of Ga(NO3)3 against A. baumannii, suggesting its potential as a promising antibacterial drug for treating bloodstream infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.",

      "abstract": "Nitrate (NO3-) and Cu2+ are common water pollutants that were frequently detected in varied waters such as metallurgical wastewater, electronic wastewater, etc. It is challenging to achieve simultaneous removal of NO3- and Cu2+. Herein, we prepared varied Pd/TiO2 catalysts for the catalytic hydrogenation reduction of Cu2+ and NO3-, and found that single Cu2+ could be effectively reduced (100 %) within 15 min, while the removal of NO3- was ignorant. Interestingly, the catalytic reduction of NO3- was triggered rapidly with the presence of Cu2+, where Cu2+ was still efficiently removed. The detected NO3- reduction intermediate products were NO2-, NH4+ and N2, and the selectivity for N2 and NH4+ in the final products were 27 % and 73 %, respectively, reflecting a synergistic treatment of multiple pollutants with clean products. The active H generated on the Pd active sites and newly formed Cu species played vital roles for the reduction of Cu2+ and NO3-, respectively. The low valence Cu was regenerated by the appearance of active H and cyclically joined NO3- reduction. Conventional technologies for NO3- removal are often inhibited or compromised in the presence of Cu2+, whereas this study circumvents these limitations and achieves efficient simultaneous removal of both Cu2+ and NO3-, with negligible generation of the byproduct NO2-. This study provided a new pathway to simultaneously catalytic eliminate heavy metal and NO3- and insights into the promote effect of coexisted Cu2+ for NO3- elimination.",

      "abstract": "The availability and proportion of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) in the marine environment fluctuate due to various processes such as upwelling, regeneration, pollution, nitrogen fixation, among others, significantly impacting the physiology and biochemistry of seaweeds. Hence, this study aims to examine the effects of varying NH4+: NO3- ratio on the growth, nutrient uptake, and biochemical composition (carbohydrate, protein, polyphenol, and pigment content) of commercially important eucheumatoid-crops Kappaphycus alvarezii, Kappaphycus striatus, and Eucheuma denticulatum. Apical portions of the seaweed samples were cultured under controlled laboratory conditions for 15 d in seawater media with a constant total nitrogen concentration of 40 μM but differing NH4+:NO3- ratios (40:0, 30:10, 20:20, 10:30, 0:40). Growth differed among species, with K. alvarezii showing highest growth rate when cultured in media containing NH4+ as the sole source of inorganic nitrogen and K. striatus displaying lowest growth in media with NO3- as the only inorganic nitrogen source. E. denticulatum had the highest range of growth rate, but showed no sensitivity to alterations in nitrogen species proportion. Generally, the NH4+ uptake rates of eucheumatoids decreased as the proportion of NH4+ in the treatment decreased, while their NO3- uptake rates increased as the concentration of NO3- became more dominant. Notably, eucheumatoids absorbed more total inorganic nitrogen when both nitrogen species were available than when only one was present. Nitrate reductase activities (NRA) were similar regardless of the NH4+:NO3- ratio except for E. denticulatum which had the highest NRA when only NO3- was present in the media. Despite differences in growth, nutrient uptake and NRA, the biochemical composition of the three eucheumatoid species remained consistent across nitrogen ratios, indicating that inorganic nitrogen proportions had minimal impacts on resource allocation to biochemical constituents. Together, our results suggest that while physiological processes such as nutrient acquisition and enzymatic activity were sensitive to inorganic nitrogen proportions, these changes did not translate into significant alterations in the allocation of resources to biochemical constituents under the experimental conditions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for the sustainable cultivation of these commercially important seaweeds under varying environmental conditions."

While it is known that their catalytic performance is determined by their microstructure and thus by their preparation, the influence of an important but commonly used calcination treatment during nanoparticle preparation on their properties is often overlooked. Herein, structural and morphological changes during the calcination of Pd(NO3)2/ZnO are studied systematically by performing in situ heating experiments mimicking typical preparation conditions, by employing environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy. The effect of different calcination parameters on Pd(NO3)2/ZnO is explored and guidance to enhance control over the preparation of small supported nanoparticles is provided.

This meta-analysis systematically evaluates the effects of dietary nitrate supplements on cardiopulmonary fitness at high altitude, as reflected in the biomarker of cardiopulmonary fitness, paving the way for informed dietary strategies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic assessment and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to examine the effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on biomarkers of cardiorespiratory health at high altitude. Studies were included if they involved healthy individuals (≥16 years of age) engaging in endurance activities such as hiking, long-distance running, mountain climbing, or bicycling at high altitude. Outcomes of interest included nitrite levels (NO2-), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), heart rate (HR), perceived exertion (RPE), and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2). Exclusion criteria included duplicate publications, non-human studies, studies with missing data that could not be retrieved, non-randomized clinical trials, and non-original research articles such as conference papers, expert consensus, or reviews. Our search for articles was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, without any language restrictions. A random effects model was employed for quantitative data analysis, utilizing Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals as summary statistics. The methods and results were reported according to the PRISMA2020 statement. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies with a sample size of 161 cases were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis indicated that dietary nitrate supplement significantly elevated NO2- concentration (95% CI: 1.38 to 3.12; SMD = 2.25, P < 0.00001; I2 = 70%). However, there was no significant effect observed on VO2max (95% CI: -0.58 to 0.23; SMD = -0.17, P = 0.76; I2 = 0%), HR (95% CI: -0.31 to 0.23; SMD = -0.04, P = 0.77; I2 = 0%), RPE scores (95% CI: -0.49 to 0.18; SMD = -0.16, P = 0.36; I2 = 0%), and SpO2 percentage (95% CI: -0.36 to 0.20; SMD = -0.08, P = 0.58; I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis indicates that dietary nitrate intake is less correlated with cardiopulmonary fitness at high altitudes, and further research is required to clarify its impact on exercise capacity.",

This study explored the treatment performance and mechanisms for the simultaneous removal of chromate (0, 2, and 10 mg·L-1) and nitrate (20 mg·L-1) in constructed wetland (CW) microcosms with elemental sulfur additions at 0-, 5-, and 25-times background levels. Results showed that sulfur-amended microcosms achieved chromate and nitrate removal up to 76.46 % and 28.12 % higher, respectively, than 0S groups. Notably, the nitrate removal rate constant was higher in the presence of chromate than its absence, exclusively in the 25S groups. In a sediment core assay, the 25S groups also exhibited substantially facilitating effect of chromate removal potential in the presence of nitrate. Metagenomic analyses revealed upregulations of denitrification and sulfur oxidation-related functional genes along with sulfur supplementation. Autotrophic denitrifiers including Dechloromonas, Thiobacillus, Sulfuricella, and Sulfuritalea made significant contributions to chromate and nitrate removal rates, as well as functional genes encoding sulfur, nitrogen, and chromium transformation, in response to sulfur addition. These findings shed first light on the co-metabolism of chromate and nitrate by sulfur-based autotrophic denitrifiers, emphasizing their pivotal role in denitrification systems, e.g., CWs, with chromate inputs."

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which include multiple disorders of the heart and blood vessels, are the leading causes of death. Nitric oxide (NO) is a vasodilator that regulates vascular tension. Endogenous NO is produced via the L-arginine-nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway. In conditions of cardiovascular dysfunction, NOS activity is impaired, leading to NO deficiency. In turn, the reduction in NO bioactivity exacerbates the pathogenesis of CVDs. Exogenous intake of inorganic nitrate supplements endogenous production via the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway to maintain the NO supply. Salivary glands play an essential role in the conversion of nitrate to NO, with approximately 25% of circulating nitrate being absorbed and secreted into saliva. As a result, salivary nitrate concentrations can exceed that in the blood by more than tenfold. This recycled nitrate in saliva serves as a reservoir for NO and performs NO-like functions when endogenous NO production is insufficient. In this review, we summarize the emerging benefits of dietary nitrate in CVDs, with a particular focus on salivary-gland-mediated nitrate recirculation in maintaining NO bioavailability and cardiovascular homeostasis. Salivary-gland-mediated nitrate recirculation provides a novel perspective for potential intervention of CVDs.",

      "abstract": "Techno-economic analysis of distributed wellhead water treatment and desalination (DWTD) systems was carried out based on a three-year field study in three small, disadvantaged communities (DACs) to evaluate the reliability and affordability of upgrading their impaired well water. The local water supplies of the three study DACs, located in Salinas Valley, California, were contaminated with nitrate at levels (∼ 12-87 mg/L NO3--N) above the California maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mg/L NO3--N, and had elevated water salinity (∼600-1,600 mg/L total dissolved solids(TDS)) above its secondary MCL (SMCL) of 500 mg/L TDS. Well water nitrate removal and salinity reduction were accomplished via reverse osmosis (RO) based DWTD systems that operated autonomously, supported by remote monitoring and supervisory cyberinfrastructure. Reliable DWTD operation provided treated water quality, with respect to nitrate and salinity, in the range of 0.5-6.3 mg/L NO3--N and 57-161 mg/L TDS, respectively, which were well below the respective MCL and SMCL. The levelized cost of water treatment was in the range of ∼$2/m3- $2.9/m3 which aligns with typical residential water costs in California and in the study region, and monthly residential water costs ($39-$74/residential unit/month) were also within the range in California. The study showcased the DWTD approach as a viable and potentially scalable solution for upgrading impaired local potable water supply of communities lacking centralized water delivery infrastructure. However, streamlined permitting processes and standardized regulatory frameworks are critical to promoting wider adoption and maximizing the socio-economic benefits of the DWT approach. Moreover, DACs are likely to require government subsidies in order to cover the CapEx of DWTD systems in addition to upgrade of site infrastructure."

      "abstract": "Laccase's industrial application is hindered by its sensitivity and low stability to extreme conditions. To overcome these limitations, the development of biomimetic nanozymes is gaining momentum. Nevertheless, developing multifunctional nanozymes with high laccase-like activity poses several challenges. This study focused on optimizing the synthesis of imidazole-copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (I-Cu) nanozymes and characterizing its physicochemical properties. Key synthesis parameters (precursor amount, incubation time, and oven temperature) were optimized. I-Cu nanozymes were synthesized in a Teflon-lined autoclave via water-induced precipitation of Cu2+ and imidazole, mimicking the N-Cu coordination found in laccase's active sites. Initial screenings revealed the superior catalytic activity of I-Cu nanozymes synthesized using methanol compared to ethanol, and a smaller nano-scale size than laccase. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of similar chemical components as laccase (C44H69N11O20), verifying I-Cu nanozyme's capability to degrade phenolic compounds, and imidazole did not decompose throughout the synthesis process. The optimized I-Cu nanozyme demonstrated higher catalytic activity (6.569 UA), oxidation efficiency (Vmax of 0.00893 mM/min and Km of 2.4020 mM), and greater stability under varying pH, temperature, and storage conditions, compared to laccase. Conclusively, the optimized I-Cu nanozyme, with a 6.00-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to previous studies, as well as 1.69-fold higher Km, and 2.08-fold higher Vmax compared to laccase, shows promise as a wastewater treatment alternative. Its enhanced performance, achieved with fewer precursors through synthesis optimization, highlights the potential of lesser-known biomimetic nanozymes and underscores the importance of refining the synthesis parameters."

Nitrate stimulates seed germination, but whether it directly regulates ABA signaling and the associated underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we showed that nitrate alleviates the repressive effects of ABA on seed germination independently of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway. Moreover, nitrate attenuates ABA signaling activated by ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) and ABI5, two critical transcriptional regulators of the ABA pathway. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that ABI3 and ABI5 physically interact with the nitrate signaling-related core transcription factor NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 8 (NLP8). After ABA treatment, NLP8 suppresses ABA responses during seed germination without affecting ABA content. Notably, nitrate represses ABA signaling mainly through NLP8. Genetic analyses showed that NLP8 acts upstream of ABI3 and ABI5. Specifically, NLP8 inhibits the transcriptional functions of ABI3 and ABI5, as well as their ABA-induced accumulation. Additionally, NLP8 overexpression largely suppresses the ABA hypersensitivity of mutant plants exhibiting impaired NO biosynthesis or signaling. Collectively, our study reveals that nitrate counteracts the inhibitory effects of ABA signaling on seed germination and provides mechanistic insights into the NLP8-ABI3/ABI5 interactions and their antagonistic relationships in ABA signaling.",

However, the underlying drivers behind the elevated nitrate concentrations within river systems remain unclear. This study employed natural abundance isotopes combined with 15N-pairing techniques to elucidate the origins and transformation pathways of nitrate in two contrasting river ecosystems: a heavily urbanized river and a minimally disturbed forested river. Results revealed that domestic sewage was the dominant nitrate source in both rivers, contributing 56.9 % in the urban river and 37.8 % in the forested river. Denitrification was identified as the primary nitrate removal process, although its efficiency was constrained in the urban river due to excessive nitrate inputs and limited in-stream removal capacity. Furthermore, soil denitrification was largely regulated by moisture. The elevated nitrate loadings within urban river were attributed to substantial domestic sewage inputs coupled with limited nitrate removal capabilities. These findings highlight the impact of urbanization on nitrate dynamics and underscore the urgent need for integrated management strategies. Effective measures, such as upgrading wastewater treatment infrastructure, preserving riparian vegetation, and implementing nutrient reduction programs, are critical for mitigating nitrate pollution and enhancing water quality in both urban and natural river systems.

At the same time, an H2O2-induced human arterial endothelial cell (HAoEC) senescence model was established to verify the role of miR-34a in AS-associated senescence. RESULTS: We observed that sodium nitrate decreased the Oil Red O-positive area, reduced the serum cholesterol (CHO) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations, and relieved inflammatory reactions in ApoE-/- mice. Moreover, the SA-β-Gal-positive area, the expression of cell cycle regulation-related genes and miR-34a in the aorta decreased after sodium nitrate treatment. Furthermore, sodium nitrate upregulated the expression of FGF21 by inhibiting the expression of miR-34a, thereby rescuing the senescent phenotype of HAoECs. These results suggested that sodium nitrate could rescue the endothelial cell senescence phenotype and alleviate aortic atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice by regulating the miR-34a/FGF21 axis. DISCUSSION: These findings might lead to the introduction of a new therapy for senescence-related diseases in the future."

Herein, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and wet digestion using H2SO4-H2O2 to analyze the metabolic response and changes in the mineral element content of spinach to nitrate stress (150 mM NO3-) after FA (0.15%) foliar spray application. After 2 days of the stress treatment, FA was sprayed thrice (once every 7 days), sampled 4 days after the last spraying, and metabolites and mineral element contents were measured. FA treatment significantly increased organic acid contents (tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, and ascorbic acid) and amino acid contents (threonine, asparagine, valine, tyrosine, alanine, glutamate, serine, histidine, arginine, and glutamine) under nitrate stress. FA application also significantly improved mineral element contents (P, Na, Fe, and Zn) under nitrate stress. This study provides comprehensive insights into metabolite accumulation of metabolites and the improvement of nutritional quality in spinach through FA application under nitrate stress. Further research should focus on elucidating additional underlying molecular mechanisms of these metabolic responses for better utilization of this natural compound in agriculture.",

      "abstract": "Electrochemical nitrate-to-nitrogen conversion provides an available approach for efficient waste water remediation. However, high nitrogen selectivity is difficult to achieve, due to inappropriate aquatic H supply for hydrogenation of oxynitride intermediates and relatively high energy barrier for NO bond breakage. In this study, Cu2O/FeO heterojunction is constructed to drive electrochemical nitrate reduction. A straightforward apparent kinetic analysis was performed to define the formation rate of the key nitrogen compounds.Comprehensive structure and electrochemical analysis combined with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism for enhanced nitrate-to-nitrogen conversion efficiency based on Cu2O/FeO heterojunction. FeO introduction is confirmed to beneficial for moderate water cracking, providing right amount of aquatic *H to adapt the hydrogenation processes during nitrate to nitrogen conversion. Moreover, FeO introduction induces the generation of Cu2O/FeO heterojunction. Self-driven local charge redistribution takes place at the Cu2O/FeO heterointerface, resulting in nucleophilic and electrophilic regions. Such unique structure is conducive to targeted asymmetric adsorption of oxynitrides in a configuration of CuONFe, thus facilitating fracture of NO bond and promoting the generation of *N. Excess accumulation of *N is beneficial for nitrogen generation through *N-*N coupling, resulting in high nitrogen selectivity. As a result, the optimized Cu2O/FeO electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) performance, featured for a high nitrate removal rate of ∼ 100 % and 81.58 % nitrogen selectivity at -0.7 V (vs. RHE) after 8 h electrolysis."

The ammonia electrooxidation reaction (AmOR) emerges as a promising avenue to leverage NH₃ in energy conversion and environmental applications. This review explores the multifaceted importance of NH3 oxidation through three primary strategies: its integration into fuel cell technology for clean energy generation, its use in wastewater treatment for ammonia removal, and its application in electrolyzer setups for producing value-added products. Special emphasis is placed on oxidizing NH3 to nitrite (NO2 -) and nitrate (NO3 -) in electrolyzers as a potential alternative to the energy-intensive Ostwald process. The review highlights recent advances in catalyst development for efficient NO2 -/NO3 - synthesis, the influence of the pH on reaction selectivity, and various reported experimental AmOR solutions. By addressing these critical aspects, this work aims to underscore the potential of NH3 oxidation in electrolyzers for sustainable energy solutions. Potential future research directions and challenges are also discussed."

Each concentration of PN was applied to a hemi-arch for 10 min, and then a 35% bleaching agent was applied. The participants underwent two sessions of bleaching with a one-week interval. TS was recorded using a questionnaire and a visual analog scale. RESULTS: According to McNemar's test, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of TS in group A (p=0.013) and group B (p=0.000) across the time assessments. Fisher's Exact Test showed no significant difference between the control and treatment sides (p>0.05). There was a significant reduction in TS intensity for both groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 10% and 35% PN were effective in reducing the prevalence and intensity of TS, as well as 5% PN, and the treatments did not affect color change.

      "abstract": "Poor vascular function and reduced nitric oxide (NO)-bioavailability have been recognized to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A non-pharmacological treatment that is gaining clinical interest in the context of vascular function is dietary inorganic nitrate (NO3-) supplementation which increases NO-bioavailability through the NO3- -nitrite (NO2-) - NO pathway. This treatment has been demonstrated to improve vascular function in several clinical populations, but no study has investigated the effects in individuals with AD. Therefore, changes in plasma NO3- and NO2- and vascular responsiveness (hyperemic response to single-passive leg movement (ΔPLM)) were measured in individuals with AD (n = 10, 76 ± 9 years), healthy elderly (OLD, n = 10, 75 ± 6 years), and young individuals (YN, n = 10, 25 ± 4 years) before (T0) and hourly for 4 h (T1, T2, T3, and T4) after ingestion of either NO3--rich beetroot juice (BR) or a placebo (PLA). No changes in NO3- and NO2-, nor ΔPLM were detected in any group following PLA intake. Plasma NO3- and NO2- increased significantly in all three groups at T1 (p < 0.001) and remained elevated for the rest of the trial. The same trend was found in ΔPLM, which significantly increased in all three groups over the time (p < 0.001). However, AD exhibited significantly lower ΔPLM values at any time point compared to YN (p < 0.001) and OLD (p < 0.001). These data suggest that AD-individuals included in this study were able to reduce NO3- to NO2- and to increase NO-mediated vascular responsiveness as non-AD-individuals. Other mechanisms, beyond NO-bioavailability, may be involved in vascular dysfunction in patients with AD. This research suggests that an acute administration of inorganic nitrate is not enough to revert chronically adapted vascular properties and completely restore vascular responsiveness in AD.",

VaD is linked to cerebrovascular lesions, such as those from white matter ischemia and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, which can also occur in AD. Nitric oxide (NO) regulates cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the central nervous system. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist approved for AD treatment. This study investigated the efficacy and molecular mechanism of MN-08, a novel memantine nitrate, in one VaD model (2VO) and two AD models (APP/PS1 mice and Aβ1-42-induced mice). MN-08 increased CBF, ameliorated cognitive and memory functions in VaD and AD, and was more effective than memantine. MN-08 increased the survival rate of CA1 neurons and mitigated white matter lesions and axonal damage. Moreover, MN-08 protected neurons from OGD-induced loss and promoted axonal outgrowth in the hippocampus by upregulating phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β), and high-molecular-weight neurofilaments (p-NFH). The beneficial effects of MN-08 were attenuated by carboxy-PTIO, a potent NO scavenger, suggesting that MN-08-derived NO may alleviate cognitive impairment from cerebral hypoperfusion. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MN-08 is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of dementia including VaD and AD.",

In the present work, the potential of a biofilm reactor to simultaneously remove nitrate (NO3--N), carbamazepine (CBZ), and copper ions (Cu2+) was evaluated. The reactor was filled with FeMn-modified ceramsite (CS@FeMn) and inoculated with the strains of Cupriavidus sp. HY129 and Pantoea sp. MFG10, which contributed to the redox cycling of Mn. Under optimum conditions with the HRT, C/N and pH of 9.0 h, 2.0, and 7.0, respectively, the bioreactor incorporating CS@FeMn demonstrated a significant increase in nitrogen removal capacity compared to the CS carrier, achieving a NRE of 96.7 %. Moreover, the removal efficiencies of CBZ and Cu²⁺ reached the values of 91.8 % and 85.6 %, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the removals of CBZ and Cu²⁺ were closely associated with microbial activity, involving the combined effects of microbial metabolism, adsorption of CS@FeMn, and bioprecipitation. Analyses through high-throughput sequencing and KEGG pathway revealed that the presence of CBZ and Cu²⁺ reshaped the structure of microbial community within the bioreactor, driving the regulation of functional genes and nitrogen metabolism-related genes to maintain metabolic stability. These findings indicated that the CS@FeMn bioreactor system presents an effective solution for simultaneously addressing multiple pollutants in water treatment, achieving high efficiencies in NO3--N, CBZ, and Cu2+ removal."

      "abstract": "The ammonia electrooxidation reaction (AOR) has attracted significant attention for both wastewater treatment and energy storage applications. However, AOR pathways generating oxygenated products such as nitrite or nitrate remain unresolved. Attenuated total reflection-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) have been combined to determine the potential-dependent intermediates, active catalytic sites, and AOR pathways on Ni electrodes under alkaline conditions. The OH/O vacancy sites on NiOOH, revealed by XPS, are found by DFT calculations to be the active sites for the AOR, catalyzing the complete (eight-electron) oxidation of ammonia into nitrate. The formation of isolated OH/O vacancies on NiOOH is thermodynamically more favorable than that of paired vacancies in the potential range conducive to NiOOH formation and the AOR, with an increasing formation barrier at higher potentials. This synergistic ATR-SEIRAS and DFT study reveals that the selectivity of nitrite and nitrate production is potential-dependent, with nitrite and hydrazine formation initiated at moderate anodic potentials, whereas larger potentials promote conversion of nitrite into nitrate species. The release of adsorbed nitrite and nitrate, which is crucial for liberating catalytic sites for the continuous AOR, is spectroscopically and computationally shown to be facilitated at relatively low potentials. Comprehending AOR mechanisms on Ni-based catalysts as achieved in this study can pave the way for future research on catalyst design and optimization of AOR performance."

Three structurally similar compounds with different substituent compounds, namely phenol (Ph), benzoic acid (BA) and salicylic acid (SA), were selected as target pollutants in this study, to explore these issues from a new perspective: the effect of substituents on contaminants. The results showed that both NO3 - and NO2 - inhibited the removal of the three pollutants in the UV/PDS system. However, the varying substituents on the compounds influenced the electron density of their molecular structures, causing different responses to NO3 - and NO2 - during treatment. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) played a more significant role in the oxidation of these compounds in the UV/PDS/NO2 - system than in UV/PDS/NO3 -. Additionally, NO3 - and NO2 - seemed to affect the types of RNS that are most active in the process. The different substituents also influenced which positions on the molecule were attacked by reactive species, ultimately impacting the formation of N-containing byproducts. Although oxidation products were theoretically predicted and identified, many potential products remained undetected according to results from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. This study offers a new perspective by focusing on the characteristics of pollutants to evaluate the impact of NO3 - and NO2 - when UV/PDS is applied as an advanced wastewater treatment method."

      "abstract": "The preservation of groundwater quality is essential for maintaining the integrity of the water ecological cycle. The preservation of groundwater quality is crucial for sustaining the integrity of the water ecological cycle. Nitrate (NO3-) has emerged as a pervasive contaminant in groundwater, attracting significant research attention due to its extensive distribution and the potential environmental consequences it poses. The primary sources of NO3- pollution include soil organic nitrogen, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, domestic sewage, industrial wastewater, landfill leachate, as well as organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and manure. A comprehensive understanding of these sources is imperative for devising effective strategies to mitigate NO3- contamination. Technologies for tracing NO3--polluted groundwater include hydrochemical analysis, nitrogen and oxygen isotope techniques, microbial tracers, and numerical simulations. Quantitative isotope analysis frequently necessitates the application of mathematical models such as IsoSource, IsoError, IsoConc, MixSIR, SIAR, and MixSIAR to deduce the origins of pollution. This study provides a summary of the application scenarios, as well as the strengths and limitations of these models. In terms of remediation, pump and treat and permeable reactive barrier are predominant technologies currently employed. These approaches are designed to remove or reduce NO3- concentrations in groundwater, thereby restoring its quality. The study offers a systematic examination of NO3- pollution, encompassing its origins, detection methodologies, and remediation approaches, highlighting the role of numerical simulations and integrating multidisciplinary knowledge. Additionally, this review delves into technological advancements and future trends concerning the detection and treatment of NO3- pollution in groundwater. It proposes methods to control the spread of pollution and acts as a guide for identifying and preventing pollution sources.",

      "abstract": "Nitrate (NO3 -), a key form of inorganic nitrogen (N) in soils, is typically lost in tea gardens through leaching. However, NO3 - utilization efficiency (NiUE) and its characteristic mechanism in tea plants remain unclear. This study screened contrastive genotypes of NiUE using leaf chlorate sensitivity and explored the potential genes that regulate this process. Fresh branches of 10 cultivars were hydroponically cultivated and subjected to potassium nitrate (KNO3) and potassium chlorate (KClO3) treatments, with the former as the control group. The sensitive cultivar, Zhenong 117 (ZN117), showed a decrease in SPAD and Fv/Fm values following KClO3 treatment, while the tolerant cultivar, Teiguanyin (TGY), exhibited minimal significant changes. After 5 days of cultivation, the 15N concentration and proportion in new shoots of ZN117 were significantly higher than those in TGY. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of genes responsible for NO3 - transport, including the nitrate transporters NRT2.4, NPF4.6, NPF6.1, NPF1.10, and NPF1.11, significantly increased in ZN117 after NO3 - supply. Genes involved in NO3 - reduction, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis were progressively induced. Coexpression network analysis indicated that the squamosa promoter-binding protein activated the onset of NO3 - signaling, while basic helix-loop-helix transcripts were triggered to higher levels during NO3 - supply. This study proposes a rapid characterization method of NiUE in woody plants and a speculative molecular regulatory mechanism for the NO3 - transfer and remobilization of tea plants. A set of specific genes involved in NO3 - transport, reduction, and mobilization were identified and proposed as marker genes for NiUE in tea plants."

      "abstract": "Sarcocystis spp. are zoonotic protozoan parasites found worldwide, transmitted through the consumption of infected meat. These parasites form cysts in the muscles of livestock, causing economic losses and health risks, including reduced meat and milk production, abortions, and, in severe cases, death in intermediate hosts. This study evaluates the antiparasitic effects of nitrate and lactic acid against Sarcocystis bradyzoites in sheep meat, aiming to identify effective decontamination methods to enhance food safety. Samples of Sarcocystis cysts were collected from infected sheep organs and treated with various concentrations (3%, 6%, 9%, and 12%) of nitrate and lactic acid for 3-48 h. Bradyzoite viability was assessed microscopically after staining and digestion. Additionally, bioassays were conducted using cats to confirm the treatment's efficacy. Results demonstrated that both compounds significantly increased bradyzoite mortality with higher concentrations and longer exposure times. Lactic acid showed greater efficacy at lower concentrations; 100% mortality was achieved at 3% lactic acid after 48 h and 6% after 24 h. In contrast, nitrate required 12% concentration for 100% mortality within 24 h. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between compound concentration and exposure time with bradyzoite mortality, highlighting lactic acid's superior antiparasitic properties at lower concentrations compared with nitrate. This study highlights the potential of lactic acid and nitrate as natural decontamination agents for meat safety. Their application could mitigate Sarcocystis-related risks, reduce foodborne parasitic infections, and contribute to the economic sustainability of meat production."

Over a six-day period, we analyzed changes in algal bloom-forming Microcystis density, chlorophyll-a levels (indicative of algal biomass), nitrate concentration, and microbial community composition in water treated with biochar and Bacillus sp. AK3 and Alcaligenes sp. M3-immobilized biochar. In water treatment using the AK3 and M3-immobilized biochar, Microcystis density decreased from 600,000 cells/mL to 80,000 cells/mL, and chlorophyll-a concentrations also substantially reduced, from 85.7 µg/L initially to 42.8 µg/L. Nitrate concentrations in the AK3 and M3-immobilized biochar treatment significantly decreased from approximately 23 mg/L to around 14 mg/L by Day 6, demonstrating the enhanced denitrification capabilities of the immobilized Alcaligenes sp. M3 and associated bacterial communities. The results also showed significant shifts in bacterial communities, with a decrease in Microcystis, highlighting the specific algicidal activity of Bacillus sp. AK3.

MAIN METHODS: Antimicrobial efficacy of the combination of fenticonazole nitrate and colistin against Escherichia coli in vitro using MIC assays, checkerboard assays, growth curves, and time-kill curves. Crystalline violet staining for detection of biofilm. Mechanisms analysis using fluorescence detection, SEM. Analysis of fenticonazole nitrate and MCR-1 interaction using molecular docking and ITC. Finally, the efficacy of combination therapy for MCR-1-positive Escherichia coli was assessed in vivo. KEY FINDINGS: Fenticonazole nitrate significantly enhanced the ability of colistin to combat mcr-1-positive E. coli 42 in vitro. The combination could effectively inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate established biofilms. Fenticonazole nitrate and colistin could increase the outer membrane permeability of E. coli 42, disrupting the membrane potential and impairing PMF synthesis, which in turn led to a reduction in ATP levels and cell death. Further, we found that the outer membrane barrier of Gram-negative bacteria and the innate resistance mechanism mediated by efflux pumps can impair the antimicrobial activity of fenticonazole nitrate. Finally, the combination demonstrated strong synergistic effects in a mouse model of infection with mcr-1-positive E. coli 42. Compared to the colistin only group, the survival rate increased by 40 %. CONCLUSION: Fenticonazole nitrate is a promising antibiotic adjuvant against infections caused by MCR-1-positive multidrug-resistant pathogens.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lead (Pb²⁺) is a toxic metal known to induce oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Natural compounds like Allium sativum essential oil (ASEO) offer potential therapeutic benefits against lead-induced damage, but their cardioprotective effects remain underexplored. This study investigates the efficacy of ASEO in mitigating cardiovascular toxicity induced by lead nitrate in male Swiss albino mice. METHODS: Thirty-six male mice were divided into six groups: Control, Lead Nitrate (50 mg/kg), Lead Nitrate + Low-dose ASEO (50 mg/kg), Lead Nitrate + High-dose ASEO (80 mg/kg), Lead Nitrate + Silymarin (25 mg/kg), and Lead Nitrate + Olive Oil. After 12 days of lead exposure, treatments were administered for 30 days. Key cardiovascular parameters such as lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL), nitric oxide (NO), and inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-10, NF-κB) were evaluated alongside histological analysis of cardiac tissue. RESULTS: Lead nitrate exposure significantly increased total cholesterol (88.27 µg/mL) and LDL (93.78 µg/mL) while reducing HDL (17.51 µg/mL) compared to controls (P < 0.001). High-dose ASEO lowered total cholesterol (66.07 µg/mL) and LDL (49.62 µg/mL) while increased HDL (27.2 µg/mL) (P < 0.001). NO levels, reduced by lead exposure, were significantly restored by high-dose ASEO (P < 0.001). Inflammatory markers, including TNF-α, NF-kB, and IL-6, were elevated in the lead group but decreased significantly following ASEO treatment (P < 0.001). Histological analysis showed that ASEO markedly preserved myocardial architecture, reducing degeneration and inflammation. CONCLUSION: High-dose ASEO demonstrated significant cardioprotective effects against lead-induced toxicity by improving lipid profiles, enhancing NO levels, and modulating inflammatory markers. Further studies are warranted to validate these results."

      "abstract": "Ammonium and nitrate nitrogen are the two main forms of inorganic nitrogen (N) available to crops. However, it is not clear how mixtures of ammonium and nitrate N affect N uptake and partitioning in major rice cultivars in southern China. This study investigated the effects of different ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen mixture treatments (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) on the growth, photosynthetic characteristics, nitrogen uptake, gene expression, and yield of different rice cultivars (Mei Xiang Zhan NO. 2: MXZ2; Nan Jing Xiang Zhan: NJXZ). Rice root biomass, tiller number, and yield were increased by 69.5%, 42.5%, and 46.8%, respectively, in the 75:25 ammonium-nitrate mixed treatment compared to the 100:0 ammonium-nitrate mixed treatment. The nitrogen content in rice roots, stems, leaves, and grains increased by 69.5%, 64.0%, 65.5%, and 17.5%, respectively. In addition, compared with MXZ2, NJXZ had a greater proportion of N allocated to leaves and grains. Analysis of root enzyme activities revealed that the 75:25 ammonium-nitrate mixed nutrient treatment increased rice root glutamine synthetase activity by an average of 35.0% and glutamate synthetase activity by an average of 52.0%. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the 75:25 mixed ammonium-nitrate nutrient treatment upregulated the expression of genes related to the nitrogen metabolism transporter pathway. Weighted correlation network analysis revealed that some differentially expressed genes (HISX and RPAB5) regulated the activities of nitrogen-metabolizing enzymes in rice and some (SAT2, CYSKP, SYIM, CHI1, and XIP1) modulated amino acid synthesis; greater expression of these genes was detected in the 75:25 ammonium-nitrate mixed nutrient treatment. The expression characteristics of the above genes were further confirmed by RT‒qPCR. Interestingly, the expression levels of the above genes were significantly correlated with the glutamate synthase activity, photosynthetic rate, and root volume. It is noteworthy that increasing the expression of the aforementioned genes coupled with nitrogen uptake was observed in the three main rice cultivars. These results suggest that the 75:25 ammonium-nitrate mixture may have increased nitrogen-metabolizing enzyme activities and promoted nitrogen uptake through the upregulated expression of nitrogen metabolism-related genes, thereby increasing tiller number and improving rice yield."

A viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, a survival strategy of non-spore-forming bacteria in response to adverse conditions, poses a significant challenge for public health and food safety. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of nisin and gallium (III) nitrate hydrate against the Gram-positive strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum DSM 20174 and the Gram-negative strain Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, respectively. Both strains were chosen as model systems for their relevance to food and clinical settings. Culture-based methods and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to evaluate the culturability and viability of both planktonic and sessile cells, providing insights into their physiological response to antimicrobial treatment-induced stress at different concentrations (100, 250, 350, and 500 ppm). The findings highlight the strain-specific action of nisin on L. plantarum and the promising antibiofilm effects of Ga (III) against P. fluorescens. This study underscores the promising potential of FCM as a powerful tool for high-throughput analyses of antimicrobial efficacy, providing valuable insights into developing targeted biofilm control strategies for food safety and clinical applications."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dietary nitrate supplementation increases nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and reduces blood pressure (BP). Inter-individual differences in these responses are suspected but have not been investigated using robust designs, e.g., replicate crossover, and appropriate statistical models. We examined the within-individual consistency of the effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on NO biomarkers and BP, and quantified inter-individual response differences. METHODS: Fifteen healthy males visited the laboratory four times. On two visits, participants consumed 140 ml nitrate-rich beetroot juice (~ 14.0mmol nitrate) and, on the other two visits, they consumed 140 ml nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (~ 0.03mmol nitrate). Plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured 2.5 h post-supplementation. BP was measured pre- and 2.5 h post-supplementation. Between-replicate correlations were quantified for the placebo-adjusted post-supplementation plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and pre-to-post changes in BP. Within-participant linear mixed models and a meta-analytic approach estimated participant-by-condition treatment response variability. RESULTS: Nitrate-rich beetroot juice supplementation elevated plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and reduced systolic (mean:-7mmHg, 95%CI: -3 to -11mmHg) and diastolic (mean:-6mmHg, 95%CI: -2 to -9mmHg) BP versus placebo. The participant-by-condition interaction response variability from the mixed model was ± 7mmHg (95%CI: 3 to 9mmHg) for systolic BP and consistent with the treatment effect heterogeneity t = ± 7mmHg (95%CI: 5 to 12mmHg) derived from the meta-analytic approach. The between-replicate correlations were moderate-to-large for plasma nitrate, nitrite and systolic BP (r = 0.55 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on NO biomarkers and systolic BP varied significantly from participant to participant. The causes of this inter-individual variation deserve further investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05514821 .",

These parameters are critical for elucidating the biochemical and immunological responses associated with metal exposure. The research employed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques to quantify IL-10 and TNF-α levels using serum assay kits. Additionally, gel filtration chromatography with Sephacryl S300 demonstrated that serum from silver nitrate-treated groups exhibited a significantly elevated concentration of high molecular weight alkaline phosphatase compared to control groups. In the TNF-α ELISA assay, no significant differences were observed between the control and treatment groups 15 days post-injection of silver nitrate. However, a statistically significant alteration was detected in both groups 45 days post-injection (P < 0.005). Molecular docking analysis further revealed that the optimal binding pose for ALP, based on the docking score, was -5.28 kcal/mol, with a re-ranking score of -7.43 kcal/mol. Collectively, the findings indicate that silver nitrate exerts a significant impact on ALP activity, leading to a sustained increase in TNF-α levels over time, while IL-10 levels remain unaffected."

      "abstract": "Increasing nitrate concentration in water bodies is a global problem. Disposal of Metal-finishing wastewater (MFW) typically containing high concentrations of nitrate and heavy metals, contributes significantly to water pollution. There are limited studies simultaneously addressing high nitrate and heavy metal concentrations. In this study, reductive electrochemical removal (ECR) of nitrate and heavy metals from MFW is demonstrated using a Ti/Co3O4 cathode in a divided cell. Various factors influencing nitrate removal were studied, including initial nitrate-N concentration (500-1000 mg/L), current density (10-30 mA/cm2), and reusability of Ti/Co3O4 cathode. 95% of the initial 750 mg/L nitrate-N was removed within 3h at 20 mA/cm2 current density with nearly 80% selectivity for N2-N. The Ti/Co3O4 cathode could be reused 10 times with consistent performance and insignificant Co(II) leaching. Removal of ammonia-N accumulated after the ECR of MFW, was accomplished by struvite precipitation to achieve the effluent discharge limit of 50 mg/L. All heavy metals in MFW were almost completely removed in ECR process. Novelty of this study is demonstrated by simultaneous and efficient removal of high concentrations of nitrate and heavy metals and recovery of struvite from MFW. Recovery of metals and struvite indicates circular economy aspect of MFW treatment. High nitrate and metal removal efficiencies, lower selectivity for ammonia-N, excellent reusability, and low leaching of Co proved that the Ti/Co3O4 cathode stands highly sustainable and efficacious, harbouring greater potential for wastewater treatment in metal finishing industry.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that NO3--enhanced salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings is mediated by nitrate reductase (NR)-dependent nitric oxide (NO) production. Seedlings grown in nitrate condition (N) exhibited much greater salt tolerance compared with those grown in ammonium nitrate and ammonium (A) conditions, a pattern also observed in the MADS-box transcription factor 27 (mads27) mutant. NR activity was highly induced by NO3- under both normal and salt stress conditions. Only the double mutant nr1/2 and the triple mutant nr1/2/3 displayed a dramatic reduction in salt tolerance. Application of tungstate suppressed salt tolerance of wild-type seedlings but not the triple mutants. Furthermore, both NO3--enhanced salt tolerance and salt-induced NO production were totally blocked in triple mutants. However, treatment with exogenous sodium nitroprusside (an NO donor) significantly enhanced salt tolerance in both Nipponbare (NIP) and the triple mutants. Antioxidant enzyme activities in shoots were significantly inhibited in the triple mutants when compared with NIP. Furthermore, expression of OsAKT1 was specifically induced by NO3- but was inhibited in the roots of triple mutants, resulting in a lower potassium/sodium ratio in NR triple mutants. Our results revealed that NO3--conferred salt tolerance is mediated by NR-dependent NO production in rice seedlings.",

      "abstract": "Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) stands out as a promising route for sustainable ammonia synthesis, in which active hydrogen (*H) plays a crucial role in both the deoxygenation and hydrogenation steps. However, the regulation of surface *H is still overlooked, and without intervention, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction is kinetically more favored over the NO3RR, leaving the current system as far from satisfactory. Herein, based on reverse utilization of the Sabatier principle, a series of FexNiy substitutional solid-solution alloys (SSAs) are synthesized to manipulate *H behavior for enhanced NO3RR. Upon precise optimization of the alloy composition, the d-band center of HER-active Ni shifts toward the Fermi level, endowing the catalyst with strong interaction to *H and greatly prolonging its lifetime, which enables abundant supply to facilitate the NO3RR. As expected, a maximum NH3 yield rate of 31.46 mmol h-1 mg-1 is delivered over the optimized Fe3Ni1-SSA, which is considerably higher than most of the extensively reported works. Several in situ characterizations are combined to gain in-depth insight. Especially, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in internal reflection mode directly observes *H enrichment on the catalyst surface, while the accompanied facilitation of the NO3RR process is verified by external reflection mode."

      "abstract": "Ammonia (NH3) is vital in global production and energy cycles. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (e-NO3RR) offers a promising route for nitrogen (N) conversion and NH3 synthesis, yet it faces challenges like competing reactions and low catalyst activity. This study proposes a synergistic mechanism incorporating a proton donor to mediate O-end e-NO3RR, addressing these limitations. A novel method combining ultraviolet radiation reduction, confined synthesis, and microwave treatment was developed to create a model catalyst embedding Cu single atoms on La-based nanoparticles (p-CNCusLan-m). DFT analysis emphasizes the critical role of La-based clusters as proton donors in e-NO3RR, while in situ characterization reveals an O-end adsorption reduction mechanism. The catalyst achieves a remarkable Faraday efficiency (FENH3) of 97.7%, producing 10.6 mol gmetal -1 h-1 of NH3, surpassing most prior studies. In a flow cell, it demonstrated exceptional stability, with only a 9% decrease in current density after 111 hours and a NH3 production rate of 1.57 mgNH3/h/cm-2. The proton donor mechanism's effectiveness highlights its potential for advancing electrocatalyst design. Beyond NH3 production, the O-end mechanism opens avenues for exploring molecular-oriented coupling reactions in e-NO3RR, paving the way for innovative electrochemical synthesis applications."

Here, we achieved 3-5 times increase in refractory carbon degradation, 40 % improvement in denitrification, and 36.0 % decrease in N2O emission by co-culturing P. aeruginosa strain GWP-1 and G. sulfurreducens. Such an enhancement is obtained by both refractory carbon co-metabolism and interspecies electron transfer (IET) between GWP-1 and G. sulfurreducens. Importantly, IET was quantified via isotopic approach, which revealed that G. sulfureducens supplies more electrons to GWP-1 when the system was fed with cellulose (0.071 mM) than glucose (0.012 mM). This study demonstrates that the residual refractory carbon and nitrogen in treated wastewater could be further converted by mutual symbiosis of EAB and denitrifiers, which paves a synergic way for pollution and carbon reduction.",

However, the electrocatalyst faces the challenge of limited NO3 - distribution and deficient active hydrogen (Hads) on the catalyst surface resulting from the low concentration of NO3 - and the difficulty of water splitting under neutral conditions. Here, a Cu-Co dual sites tandem synergistic catalysis mechanism has been proposed by doping Cu into CoP to facilitate the adsorption and conversion of NO3 - on Cu and to accelerate the water splitting on CoP leading to the significantly high NO3 -RR performance. The designed Cu-CoP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield of 7.65 mg h-1 cm-2 and a Faraday efficiency of 85.1% at -1.0 V under neutral low-concentration nitrate (10 m M), which is the highest ammonia yield in the reported data. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations confirm the tandem synergistic effect, in which the Cu site favors the adsorption and activation of NO3 - to form NO2 -, and concurrently modulates the electronic structure of the Co site with optimized Hads adsorption resulting in the significantly enhanced NO3 -RR at neutral low concentration nitrate."

      "abstract": "Ammonia (NH3) is a critical basic material for both the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. Traditionally, NH3 synthesis has relied on the Haber-Bosch process, which is characterized by high greenhouse gas emissions and stringent reaction conditions. As a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative, electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis has gained increasing attention. Nitrate (NO3-), a common pollutant in water and soil, is considered a promising nitrogen source for NH3 production due to its high solubility and relatively low N=O bond dissociation energy. This makes it particularly suitable for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA), a process with significant potential for addressing nitrate pollution while contributing to NH3 production. However, challenges such as slow reaction kinetics and poor product selectivity persist in the NRA process. To overcome these challenges, the selection and optimization of catalysts are crucial for improving NRA performance. Among the various catalysts explored, copper-based (Cu) catalysts have attracted widespread attention due to their unique electronic structure and outstanding catalytic performance. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the application and reaction mechanisms of Cu-based catalysts in NRA, along with an overview of testing systems and evaluation metrics used in the field. Additionally, it highlights current challenges and outlines future research directions to support the continued development of Cu-based materials for NRA applications."

After in-situ reduction to Cu2O/CuO/CF from CuO/CF, it had stronger adsorption of NO3- and a higher hydrogen energy barrier, enhancing cathodic reduction of NO3- to NH3 with a high selectivity of 99.35 %. Attributed to the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (•OH), the anodic oxidation on CuO/CF could completely degrade TC within 40 min with the reaction rate constant (k = 0.253 min-1) that about 16.8 times faster than that on the conventional dimensionally stable anode (DSA). Moreover, this paired system saved approximately 58.1 % of energy consumption when compared with single systems of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction.

Numerous tactics have been developed to increase the electrocatalyst's NO3RR activity. Herein, we report a unique molecular alignment-dependent NO3RR performance using α-CuPc and β-CuPc nanostructures as effective electrocatalysts for the ambient synthesis of ammonia. The well-aligned β-CuPc demonstrated an impressive ammonia yield rate of 62 703 μg h-1 mgcat -1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 96%. In contrast, the less well-aligned α-CuPc exhibited a yield rate of 36 889 μg h-1 mgcat -1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 61% at -1.1 V vs. RHE under the same conditions. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) confirms that the well-aligned β-CuPc exhibits superior transport properties due to optimal interaction of the Cu atom with the nitrogen atom of parallel molecules (dπ-pπ) in its one-dimensional nanostructure, which is clearly reflected in the electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, theoretical research reveals that the NO3RR is the predominant process on the β-CuPc catalyst in comparison to the hydrogen evolution reaction, which is verified by gas chromatography, with β-CuPc exhibiting weaker binding of the *NO intermediate at the copper site and a lower overpotential, hence facilitating the NO3RR relative to α-CuPc."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common psychological condition affecting 10-20% of postpartum women, characterized by emotional instability, anxiety, and, in severe cases, hallucinations or suicidal ideation. Growing evidence suggests a link between oxidative stress and depression, with nitrite-a key metabolite of nitric oxide (NO)-emerging as a potential biomarker. This study explores the association between salivary nitrite levels, perinatal anxiety, and PPD, aiming to identify predictive factors for early intervention. METHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted involving 220 naturally delivered women. Saliva samples were collected at three time points: before labor analgesia, one hour post-analgesia, and on the discharge day. PPD was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 28 and 42 days postpartum. Logistic regression was applied to analyze the relationship between salivary nitrite levels and PPD risk (EPDS ≥ 9). Anxiety, information needs, and fear were evaluated as additional predictors. RESULTS: Of 220 participants, 194 completed the study. The incidence of PPD was 10.82% at 28 days and 15.98% at 42 days postpartum. Higher pre-analgesia salivary nitrite levels were significantly associated with increased PPD risk at 28 days (OR = 1.017, p < 0.05) and 42 days (OR = 1.008, p < 0.05), with a stronger effect at 28 days. Preoperative anxiety was a strong predictor at 28 days (OR = 1.76, p = 0.019), while preoperative information needs were significant at 42 days (OR = 1.22, p = 0.043). Salivary nitrite levels significantly decreased after labor analgesia and remained low at discharge. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate a significant association between salivary nitrite levels and the occurrence of postpartum depression (PPD), with this association being particularly pronounced at 28 days postpartum. Perinatal anxiety and information needs were also identified as important predictors of PPD. This research provides a new perspective for the early screening and intervention of PPD and points the way for future studies to further explore its mechanisms and predictive factors.",

However, developing highly active and stable catalysts that function effectively in a wide pH range remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a hierarchical carbon-based metal-free electrocatalyst (C-MFEC) of winged carbon coaxial nanocables (W-CCNs, in situ generated graphene nanosheets and outside carbon layer with abundant topological defects from pristine carbon nanotubes, CNTs), is prepared through moderate oxidation of CNTs and the subsequent introduction of topological defects. The W-CCNs feature functional separation properties, with an inner core of pristine CNTs that facilitates efficient charge transfer, while the outer shell is composed of in situ generated graphene nanosheets and carbon layers enriched with topological defects characterized by distinct carbon atom configurations, which play a crucial role in promoting the adsorption of NO3 -, the dissociation of water, and the N─H bond formation. This innovative design enables the C-MFEC to exhibit outstanding performance for eNO3 -RR, operating efficiently with the NH3 yield rates of 49.5, 75.3, and 88.1 g h-1 gcat. -1 in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. Such performance metrics not only outshine C-MFECs but also rival or surpass those of certain metal-based catalysts."

We recently developed a microaerophilic activated sludge system for retaining ammonia whereas removing organic carbon with minimal N2O emissions. A comprehensive understanding of nitrogen metabolisms in the system is essential to optimize system performance. Here, we employed metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses to characterize the microbial community structure and activity during the transition from a microoxic to an oxic condition. A hybrid approach combining high-quality short reads and Nanopore long reads reconstructed 98 medium- to high-quality non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes from the communities. The suppressed bacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) expression was upregulated after shifting from a microoxic to an oxic condition. Seventy-three reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes (>74% of the total) from 11 bacterial phyla harbored genes encoding proteins involved in nitrate respiration; 39 (~53%) carried N2O reductase (nosZ) genes with the predominance of clade II nosZ (31 metagenome-assembled genomes), and 24 (~33%) possessed nitrite reductase (ammonia-forming) genes (nrfA). Clade II nosZ and nrfA genes exhibited the highest and second-highest expressions among nitrogen metabolism genes, indicating robust N2O consumption and ammonification. Non-denitrifying clade II nosZ bacteria, Cloacibacterium spp., in the most abundant and active phylum Bacteroioda, were likely major N2O sinks. Elevated dissolved oxygen concentration inhibited clade II nosZ expression but not nrfA expression, potentially switching phenotypes from N2O reduction to ammonification. Collectively, the multi-omics analysis illuminated bacteria responsible for N2O reduction and ammonification in microoxic and oxic conditions, facilitating high-performance ammonia recovery.",

      "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) supply is critical for apple yield and quality. Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) could reduce fertilizer application for maintaining apple yield at the cost of environmental pollution in infertile soil. The molecular mechanisms underlying nitrate (NO3-) uptake are foundational for breeding high NUE cultivars. The two-month low N treatment mimicking infertile soil dramatically induced the accumulation of transcription factor MdWRKY17 in apple. Overexpression of MdWRKY17 conferred enhanced long-term low nitrogen tolerance in transgenic apple plants and calli, while RNA interference of MdWRKY17 reduced this tolerance. MdNRT2.5 encoding a high-affinity nitrate transporter was identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) as the direct target of MdWRKY17. This is confirmed by in vitro EMSA and in vivo ChIP-qPCR assay. Notably, overexpression of MdNRT2.5 increased NO3- uptake under long-term N-deficiency conditions. RNA interference of MdNRT2.5 in roots decreased NO3- uptake efficiency of MdWRKY17-OE transgenic apple plants, indicating that MdWRKY17 improves NO3- uptake mainly by activating MdNRT2.5 expression. Our study identified an important MdWRKY17-MdNRT2.5 module in response to long-term low N stress, which will contribute to the molecular breeding of high NUE apple cultivars.",

      "abstract": "Nitrate pollution poses severe risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health. The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) offers a promising environmental and economic solution for nitrate pollution treatment and nitrogen source recovery; however, it continues to experience limited efficiency in neutral electrolytes. This study explores the heterointerface activation effects of TiO2/Cu2O heterogeneous catalysts with rutile (R-TiO2) and anatase (A-TiO2) phases and reveals that R-TiO2 is an active crystal phase with high nitrate reduction performance. The R-TiO2/Cu2O catalyst removed 99.8 % of nitrate in 180 min and achieved an ammonia yield of 0.23 mmol h-1 cm-2 with a Faraday efficiency of 85.7 % in a neutral electrolyte. In situ characterisation and theoretical calculations revealed that heterointerface reconstruction and oxygen vacancy (OV) formation overcome the poor electrical conductivity of R-TiO2, enhance electron transfer, and optimize the active sites. Furthermore, the Cu-O-Ti bond at the interface significantly weakens the adsorption energy of the critical intermediate *NO3, thereby facilitating NITRR. This study provides new insights into crystal phase modulation in catalyst design and offers innovative strategies for developing highly efficient NITRR electrocatalysts, paving the way for sustainable nitrate pollution treatment and nitrogen source recovery."

Previous studies have shown that nitrate disrupts the reproductive system in aquatic animals, but no study has evaluated the impact of nitrate exposure on the uterus in mammals. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of maternal exposure to nitrate during the prenatal period on uterine morphology and gene expression in adult female F1 rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats were either treated with sodium nitrate 20 mg/L or 50 mg/L dissolved in drinking water from the first day of pregnancy until the birth of the offspring or were left untreated. On postnatal day 90, the uteri of female offspring rats were collected for histological and gene expression analyses. Morphometric analyses of the uterine photomicrographs were performed to determine the thickness of the layers of the uterine wall (endometrium, myometrium, and perimetrium) and the number of endometrial glands. RESULTS: The highest nitrate dose increased the myometrial thickness of the exposed female rats. Treatment with both nitrate doses reduced the number of endometrial glands compared with no treatment. Additionally, nitrate treatment significantly increased the expression of estrogen receptors and reduced the expression of progesterone receptors in the uterus. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest that prenatal exposure to nitrate programs gene expression and alters the uterine morphology in female F1 rats, potentially increasing their susceptibility to developing uterine diseases during adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco is an economic crop that primarily relies on nitrate (NO3-) as its nitrogen source, and tobacco aphid is one of the significant pests that harm its growth. However, the impact of NO3- supply on the resistance of tobacco to aphids remains unclear. Present study investigated the effects of different NO3- concentrations supply on the reproductive capacity of tobacco aphids, impact of aphid infestation on tobacco growth, secondary metabolic and transcription changes. Physiological experiments were performed to verity the transcription analysis. The results indicated that aphids preferred tobacco treated with higher concentration of nitrate, showing greater reproductive capacity under high nitrate supply. From the results of transcriptome analysis, it can be seen that the gene expression of the shoot changed significantly after aphid and NO3- treatment. GO analysis showed that the pathways associated with cell wall biosynthesis were enriched in different groups. At the same time, RNA-seq analysis revealed several genes related to the pathway of aphid damage in tobacco, as well as some transcription factors associated with insect resistance. Inoculating tobacco with aphids under different NO3- concentration increased the levels of soluble sugars, free amino acids, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid in shoot of tobacco. Additionally, it was observed that the cell wall development of leaves from low NO3- supply was incomplete, and the cell wall from high NO3- supply concentration is notably thicker. The lignin content was lower under lower NO3- supply, regardless of aphid inoculation. The trends of transcription levels in genes related to cell wall and lignin biosynthesis were consistent with the lignin contents. Collectively, our findings not only shed light on the physiological and biochemical responses of tobacco plants to NO3- treatment, but also offer novel perspectives for optimizing tobacco cultivation practices and enhancing insect resistance.",

      "abstract": "Photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to N2 holds great significance for environmental governance. However, the selectivity of nitrate reduction to N2 is influenced by sacrificial agents and the kinds of cocatalysts (such as Pt and Ag). The presence of unconsumed sacrificial agents can aggravate environmental pollution, while noble metal-based cocatalysts increase application costs. Herein, the porous boron-doped TiO2 (B-TiO2) was successfully synthesized by using the sol-gel method with Amberlite IRA-900 as a template. The incorporation of 33% boron into TiO2 (33% B-TiO2) achieved a 100% nitrate (20 ppm) conversion rate and 94.5% N2 selectivity without the need for sacrificial agents and cocatalysts during the nitrate reduction process. The catalyst's unique multistage porous structure not only enhances the light absorption ability but also significantly provides abundant surface adsorption sites. Additionally, theoretical studies show that boron doping effectively modulates the band structure of TiO2 and increases the electron density at the Ti surface active sites, both of which are essential for achieving a high nitrate reduction efficiency. This work emphasizes the synergistic effect between morphology control and electronic structure regulation in promoting the photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to nitrogen, providing valuable insights for the photocatalytic treatment of nitrate wastewater."

This study hypothesizes that combining specific N sources can increase zeatin riboside + zeatin (ZR + ZT) content in tiller nodes and maintain a higher ZR + ZT/gibberellin A7 (GA7) ratio, thereby promoting tiller development, enhancing NUE, and increasing yield. The effects of N source treatments on two wheat cultivars, the multi-spike Shannong 28 (SN28) and the large-spike Tainong 18 (TN18), were investigated. A total of seven N treatments were tested: no nitrogen (N0), urea (N1), calcium nitrate (N2), ammonium chloride (N3), and equal doses of urea and calcium nitrate (N4), urea and ammonium chloride (N5), and calcium nitrate and ammonium chloride (N6). The results showed that treatment N4 significantly increased the levels of ZR and ZT in tiller nodes, while maintaining a higher ZR + ZT to GA7 ratio. This hormonal shift promoted tiller formation and biomass accumulation. Under N4, both cultivars exhibited the highest number of effective spikes and biomass in higher-order tillers. N4 also enhanced N accumulation in the grains, N absorption efficiency, and N translocation, while reducing N loss. Compared to N1, effective spike numbers increased by 7.8% in SN28 and 5.6% in TN18, resulting in a 6.4% increase in grain yield for SN28 and a 2.2% increase for TN18. In conclusion, the combined application of urea and calcium nitrate optimizes hormonal regulation, improves NUE, and significantly enhances wheat tillering and grain yield, providing a promising strategy for enhancing wheat productivity."

W12, constructing a biofilter to enhance nitrate (NO3--N) removal in micro-polluted water. HC could accelerate electron transfer, significantly enhancing the denitrification capacity of the biofilter.

Efficient removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) and copper (Cu2+) was achieved through adsorption by HC and precipitate. Calcium ions (Ca2+) removal (74.2%) was achieved through the microbial-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) process. In addition, with the addition of CBZ and Cu2+, the biofilter maintained a stable microbial community and consistent expression of relevant functional genes.

      "abstract": "The biodegradation of organic aromatic compounds in subsurface environments is often hindered by limited dissolved oxygen. While oxygen supplementation can enhance in situ biodegradation, it poses financial and technical challenges. This study explores introducing low-oxygen concentrations in anaerobic environments for efficient contaminant removal, particularly in scenarios where coexisting pollutants are present. An innovative strategy of alternating nitrate-reducing and microaerobic conditions to stimulate biodegradation is proposed, utilizing nitrate initially to degrade easily-degradable compounds, and potentially reducing the need for additional oxygen. Batch experiments were conducted to assess the biodegradation of a BTEX, indene, indane, and naphthalene mixture using groundwater and sediments from an anaerobic contaminated aquifer. Two set-ups were incubated for 98 days to assess the redox transitions between microaerobic (oxygen concentrations < 0.5 mg O2 L-1) and nitrate-reducing conditions, aiming to minimize external electron acceptor usage while maximizing degradation. Comparative experiments under fully aerobic and fully anaerobic (nitrate-reducing) conditions were conducted, revealing that under microaerobic conditions, all compounds were completely degraded, achieving removal efficiencies comparable to fully aerobic conditions. A pre-treatment phase involving nitrate-reducing conditions followed by microaerobic conditions showed more effective utilization of oxygen specifically for contaminant degradation compared to fully aerobic conditions. Contrarily, under fully anaerobic conditions, without oxygen addition, partial degradation of ethylbenzene was observed after 400 days, while other compounds remained. The outcomes of this study can provide valuable insights for refining strategies involving oxygen and nitrate dosages, thereby enhancing the efficacy of in situ bioremediation approaches targeting complex hydrocarbon mixtures within anaerobic subsurface environments. KEY POINTS: • BTEX, indene, indane, and naphthalene mix biodegraded under microaerobic conditions • Subsurface microorganisms swiftly adapt from nitrate to microaerobic conditions • More oxygen directed to hydrocarbon biodegradation via a pre-anaerobic treatment.",

The HPHMC900 serves as an effective electrocatalyst for the reduction of nitrate in an aqueous environment to ammonia (NO3RR). Importantly, HPHMC900 demonstrated fast kinetics for the NO3RR with a low Tafel slope of 70 mV decade-1. An NH3 production yield of 21 μg h-1 mgcat-1 was obtained with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 88.3% at -0.4 V in a 0.1 M KNO3 electrolytic solution. The high double layer capacitance (Cdl) of 14.1 mF cm-2 corroborates high SABET and exposed active sites of HPHMC900. The maximum FEs were estimated to be 48%, 93%, and 98%, corresponding to 0.05, 0.5, and 1.0 M KNO3 with maximum NH3 production yields of 18.7, 22.1, and 39.0 μg h-1 mgcat-1, respectively. The potential of employing HPHMC900 for the NO3RR as an electrocatalyst is evident by its robust stability, high SABET, and enrichment with heteroatoms N (7.7%) and P (0.28%).

      "abstract": "Anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium to dinitrogen gas is an energy-efficient nitrogen removal process. One of the bottlenecks for anammox application in wastewater treatment is the stable supply of nitrite for anammox bacteria. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) is a process that converts nitrate to nitrite and then to ammonium. Significantly, it has been reported that some anammox bacteria can perform DNRA by reducing nitrate to nitrite and ammonium nitrogen with little low-molecular-weight organic acids such as volatile fatty acids. Here, we propose an innovative nitrogen removal process, i.e., nitrification and anammox coupled with partial DNRA (i.e., NPDA), and make a theoretical comparison with previously accepted partial nitrification and anammox (PNA) and partial denitrification and anammox (PdNA) for nitrogen removal. Under similar conditions of oxygen consumption, removal efficiency, external carbon source addition, and greenhouse gas emission, the novel NPDA process can better facilitate resource-effective and environment-friendly wastewater treatment. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that partial DNRA-anammox appears to be preferred, oxidizing per mole of NH4 +produces higher energy gain than that of conventional anammox alone. The carbon source limitation rather than nitrate limitation is the key to the realization of NPDA process. This perspective highlights the positive role of DNRA for sustainable wastewater management."

However, the absence of biological components limits its further applications. In this study, we developed an antiterminator microbial whole-cell biosensor (MWCB) based on B. thetaiotaomicron. The antiterminator-based element allows the chassis to detect colitis in mice by responding to nitrate and nitrite in an inflammatory environment. In particular, the nitrate/nitrite-inducible promoter was obtained by combining the constitutive promoter with the inducible terminator. Subsequently, the promoter and RBS were replaced to optimize a sensitive and specific response to nitrate/nitrite. A preliminary in vitro assessment was conducted to ascertain the functionality of the biosensor. Its in vivo sensing ability was evaluated in a chemically induced mouse model of ulcerative colitis (UC). The results demonstrated that the MWCB exhibited a robust response to colitis, with a notable positive correlation between the intensity of the response and the level of inflammation. This novel sensing element may provide a new avenue for the development of components for unconventional chassis, like B. thetaiotaomicron. It will also facilitate the development of engineered probiotics based on B. thetaiotaomicron, thereby providing patients with a wider range of medical treatment options.",

      "abstract": "Nitrate electroreduction is promising for achieving effluent waste-water treatment and ammonia production with respect to the global nitrogen balance. However, due to the impeded hydrogenation process, high overpotentials need to be surmounted during nitrate electroreduction, causing intensive energy consumption. Herein, a hydroxide regulation strategy is developed to optimize the interfacial H2O behavior for accelerating the hydrogenation conversion of nitrate to ammonia at ultralow overpotentials. The well-designed Ru─Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst shows a remarkable energy efficiency of 44.6% at +0.1 V versus RHE and a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for NH3 synthesis at 0 V versus RHE. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that Ni(OH)2 can regulate the interfacial H2O structure with a promoted H2O dissociation process and contribute to the spontaneous hydrogen spillover process for boosting NO3 - electroreduction to NH3 at Ru sites. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn-NO3 -/ethanol battery system exhibits an outstanding long-term cycling stability during the charge-discharge tests with the production of high-value-added ammonium acetate, showing great potential for simultaneously achieving nitrate removal, energy conversion, and chemical synthesis. This work can not only provide a guidance for interfacial H2O regulation in extensive hydrogenation reactions but also inspire the design of a novel hybrid flow battery with multiple functions."

      "abstract": "Wound dressing development is an area of active research. Traditional dressings lack antibacterial activity, biocompatibility, and tissue regeneration. Alginate is a heavily investigated polymer employed as wound dressings and can be combined with a wide range of additives. Herein, we report the preparation of alginate gel using the crosslinking technique as potential wound dressing, with insight investigation of the influence of employing single, two, or three cross-linkers: Strontium (Sr), zinc oxide (ZnO), and gentamicin sulfate. Rheology was used to confirm the gel's preparation, where the samples' viscosity curves show decreased viscosity with increased shear rate, indicating pseudoplastic flow. The linear viscoelastic region shows constant G' and G\" within the sample structure. In this study, we used three gels with different mixtures of ingredients: Gels A, B, and C contain sodium alginate (1% w/v) and 0.5 mL of Sr nitrate (4% w/v). However, Gels B and C contain 0.25 mL of ZnO (0.5% w/v). Gel C also includes 0.1 mL of gentamicin (1% w/v). The study examined the effectiveness of Gel A, B, and C on wound healing, calculating the reduction of wound area after seven, 14, and 20 days of a single topical treatment. Gel A, B, and C significantly reduced wound area, while Gel B and C showed a significant reduction. The zone of inhibition was used to detect the gels' efficacy against microorganisms. The study found zinc deposition in the liver and bone, with Gel B and C showing higher levels. The study also found significant overexpression of MIP α and MIP β in tissues and downregulation of CCL2, IL8, and TGF β, explaining wound healing with minimal scar formation.",

      "abstract": "Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to harmless nitrogen (N2) presents a viable approach for purifying NO3--contaminated wastewater, yet most current electrocatalysts predominantly produce ammonium/ammonia (NH4+/NH3) due to challenges in facilitating N-N coupling. This study focuses on identifying metal catalysts that preferentially generate N2 and elucidating the mechanistic origins of their high selectivity. Our evaluation of 16 commercially available metals reveals that only Pb, Sn, and In demonstrated substantial N2 selectivity (79.3, 70.0, and 57.0%, respectively, under conditions of 6 h electrolysis, a current density of 10 mA/cm2, and an initial NO3--N concentration of 100 mg/L), while others largely favored NH4+ production. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that NH4+-selective catalysts (e.g., Co) exhibited high water activity that enhances •H coverage, thereby promoting the hydrogenation of NO3- to NH4+ through the hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. In contrast, N2-selective catalysts, with their lower water activity, promoted the formation of N-containing intermediates, which likely undergo dimerization to form N2 via the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism. Enhancing NO3- adsorption was beneficial to improve N2 selectivity by competitively reducing •H coverage. Our findings highlight the crucial role of water activity in NO3RR performance and offer a rational design of electrocatalysts with enhanced N2 selectivity.",

We investigated the effects of dietary nitrate (NO3-) supplementation combined with high-intensity training performed under hypoxic conditions on antioxidant/pro-oxidant balance. Thirty trained participants were assigned to one of three groups - HNO: hypoxia (13% FiO2) + NO3-; HPL: hypoxia + placebo; CON: normoxia (20.9% FiO2) + placebo - while performing 12 cycling high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sessions during a 4-week period (3 sessions/week). Before and after the intervention, venous blood samples were collected and a time to exhaustion test (Tlim) was performed (with vastus lateralis changes in local O2 saturation: SmO2 monitoring). Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity increased in CON (p = 0.017, ~20%) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) did not change in any group. Malondialdehydes (MDA) increased in both HNO (p = 0.001, ~60%) and CON (p = 0.023, ~30%) but not in HPL. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), uric acid, and myeloperoxidase activity were not modified by the protocol. Only the CON group recovered faster after the Tlim test (SmO2recovery: p = 0.0003, ~58%). Hypoxic exposure during high-intensity training blunted the increase in GPX and MDA after the intervention period. However, the effects of NO3- supplementation seem to very slightly mitigate the detrimental effect of performing high-intensity training under hypoxic conditions."

      "abstract": "Catalytic reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (N2) by noble metals stands as a feasible and promising manner to address the biological and environmental issues associated with nitrate pollution; however, nitrate reduction under single noble-metal catalyzation remains substantially stuck because of the low adsorption enthalpy of noble metal toward nitrate. Tailoring the formation (crystal structure and particle size) of catalytical metal particles, coupled with a more direct electron donating pattern, provides a potential solution for the main challenge in reduction efficiency and selectivity. In this study, we assembled a Pd-based nanocomposite (Pda@EC) by subtly regulating the embedded Pd nanoparticles inside a porous substrate self-sufficient in electron donator (i.e., ethylenediamine group, EDA). Without any provision of reductant, the resultant single-metal catalyst demonstrated excellent nitrate catalytic reduction with over 95 % of N2 reduction selectivity within very broad pH range (3-11), whereas its unregulated counterpart (crystal Pd nanocomposite, Pdc@EC) is incapable of efficient nitrate reduction under otherwise identical conditions. The activated hydrogen (H*), which was exclusively yielded under the catalyzation of the amorphous Pd nanoparticles for the electron donating EDA, was confirmed as the primary active species, and the high N2 selectivity is attributed to the cooperation between EDA and Pd nanoparticles. More promisingly, the exhausted Pda@EC is amenable to effective regeneration with mild NaOH (elution) and NaBH4 (restoration) treatment. This work provides an effective strategy for selectively reducing nitrate under monometallic catalyzation by subtly regulating the crystal structure of Pd nanoparticles in endogenous electron-donating environment."

      "abstract": "Activation of H2O cleavage for H* production by defect engineering eliminates the insufficient supply of protons in the NO3-RR process under neutral conditions. However, it remains challenging to precisely control the defect formation for optimizing the equilibrium between H* production and H* binding. Here, we propose a strategy to boost defect generation through S-doping induced NiFe-LDH lattice distortion, and successfully optimize the balance of H* production and binding. The Faraday efficiency of the Sx-NiFe-LDH-Ov@CuO/CF electrode for treating 100 mg-N L-1 nitrate wastewater at -0.4 V vs. RHE is up to 97.8 %, which is superior to the reported advanced catalysts for the treatment of low nitrate concentrations. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations show that the sulfur-mediated defect leads to the d-band center displacement of Ni and Fe sites, which efficiently promotes the enrichment of NO3- and inhibits the binding of H*. A localized NO3- and H+-rich environment is thus constructed to achieve the rapid hydrogenation of *NO and ensure a high NO3-RR activity. This work provides several insights for modulating structural defects and analyzing intrinsic active sites to achieve high-performance electrocatalysts for the treatment of nitrate wastewater with low carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.",

Density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the excellent performance of np Ag,Ni-Cu results from a trimetallic synergistic effect and nanopore enrichment/confinement effect, in which the codoping of Ni and Ag into Cu can enhance NO3- adsorption, prevent *NO2 desorption, and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, while nanopores can promote NO3- accumulation on the internal surface of nanopores and confine the reaction intermediates within the nanopores for a deeper NO3- electroreduction."

      "abstract": "Pyrite is considered as an effective and environmentally friendly substrate in constructed wetlands (CW) for wastewater treatment, but its application in recirculation stacking hybrid constructed wetlands (RSHCW) has been scarcely studied. This study uses varying amounts of pyrite as the substrate in RSHCW, leveraging the recirculation of wastewater to alter microenvironments such as dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH, to explore the potential mechanisms of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal in pyrite-based RSHCW. The results show that as the proportion of pyrite increases, the removal rate of total phosphorus (TP) in the effluent also increases (25%→58%), significantly enhancing the deposition of iron-bound phosphorus (Fe-P) on the substrate, thereby turning CW into a P reservoir. Even in the absence of a carbon source, the total nitrogen (TN) removal rate in the CW still increases by 20%, which can be attributed to the enrichment of sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria driving autotrophic denitrification by pyrite. Additionally, the addition of pyrite significantly increases the electron transfer system activity (ETSA) in the CW system by approximately 6.14 times and facilitates a \"charging and discharging\" function through the sulfur-iron electron cycle. Selective enrichment of microbes in moderated pH environment due to RSHCW recirculation in the pyrite-CW (PCW) enhances the coordination among microbial communities and the interaction among functional genes. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of N and P removal in CWs under the influence of pyrite.",

Poly(triazine imide)/LiCl (PTI/LiCl), a highly crystalline carbon nitride with a well-defined structure, has shown significant potential in this field. In this study, the electronic properties and catalytic performance of PTI/LiCl for NO3RR were investigated through theoretical calculations. Band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) analyses show that the intercalation of Li+ and Cl- ions within the PTI pores enhances electronic conductivity and improves its electronic properties. The reduction of nitrate to NH3 through a series of intermediates on the PTI/LiCl (001) surface shows exothermic free energy changes for each elementary step. The catalyst demonstrates outstanding selectivity and stability, effectively suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and byproduct formation. Charge density difference and PDOS analyses confirm the orbital interactions between absorbed NO3 and Li ions. The study highlights the potential of PTI/LiCl as a low-cost, efficient electrocatalyst for NO3RR and provides theoretical and practical insights for the design of environmentally friendly catalysts."

In this study, the NRT2s gene family were systematically analyzed in alfalfa. We identified three MsNRT2 genes from the genomic database. They were named MsNRT2.1-2.3 based on their chromosomal location. The phylogenetic tree revealed that NRT2 proteins were categorized into two main subgroups, which were further confirmed by their gene structure and conserved motifs. Three MsNRT2 genes distributed on 2 chromosomes. Furthermore, we studied the expression patterns of MsNRT2 genes in six tissues based on RNA-sequencing data from the Short Read Archive (SRA) database of NCBI, and the results showed that MsNRT2 genes were widely expressed in six tissues. After leaves and roots were treated with drought, salt, abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) for 0-48 h, and we used quantitative RT-PCR to analyze the expression levels of MsNRT2 genes and the results showed that most of the MsNRT2 genes responded to these stresses. However, there are specific genes that play a role under specific treatment conditions. This result provides a basis for further research on the target genes. In summary, MsNRT2s play an irreplaceable role in the growth, development and stress response of alfalfa, and this study provides valuable information and theoretical basis for future research on MsNRT2 function.",

      "abstract": "Nitrate is a crucial nutrient in the natural nitrogen cycle. However, human activities have elevated nitrate levels in aquatic ecosystems beyond natural thresholds, posing risks to human health and the environment. In this work, ZnCl2-doped mesoporous silica nanoparticles (ZnCl2@MSN) were synthesized using a one-pot preparation method, leading to a streamlined process with reduced time and energy consumption. The homogeneous mesoporous ZnCl2@MSN exhibited efficient nitrate removal from water, primarily through ion exchange mechanisms (70.97%), with additional support from electrostatic attraction (29.03%). A removal efficiency of 85.11% ± 4.96% was achieved, with a maximum removal capacity of 22.37 mg g-1 within 15 min in synthetic water (0.75 g ZnCl2@MSN; 100 mL of 100 mg L-1 nitrate solution, without pH adjustment, at room temperature (25 °C)). Furthermore, batch adsorption demonstrated a removal efficiency of up to 99.05% ± 5.88% for real water samples. The experimental data fitted best to the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 = 0.9966) and the pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.9985). Thermodynamic studies revealed a spontaneous and exothermic adsorption process. Nitrate exhibited tolerance to coexisting ions using ZnCl2@MSN in the order of PO43- > CO32- > F- > Cl- > SO42- > Br-, and the material could be reused up to three times. This research highlights the significant advantages of ZnCl2@MSN, which is synthesized through a simpler and more energy-efficient procedure compared to similar materials reported previously. Despite its streamlined preparation, ZnCl2@MSN achieves a superior adsorption capacity, requiring less adsorbent for effective treatment. This not only minimizes waste generation but also reduces operational costs. Furthermore, its excellent reusability enhances cost-efficiency, making it a highly practical solution. Importantly, the evaluation of treated water confirmed that the zinc concentration remained well below the EPA discharge limit. These findings underscore the potential of ZnCl2@MSN as an advanced, sustainable, and economical material for nitrate removal.",

In this work, we evaluated changes in endogenous NO levels during the onset of P-restriction in soybean plants (Glycine max), focusing on the possible pathways involved in its generation, namely NR and NO synthase like activity, NOSlike, and the subsequent role of NR during low P-acclimation. During the first 96 h of P-starvation NO levels increased in the leaves. The treatment of plants with L-NAME (a known inhibitor of NOS) did not markedly affect NO levels, while the inhibition of NR activity with sodium tungstate (W) reduced NO-related DAF-FM fluorescence. In addition, P-restriction triggered typical acclimation responses such as the increase of acid phosphatase (AP) and ribonuclease (RNase) activities, and the accumulation of organic acids (malic and citric). Treatment of P starved plants with W reduced NR activity as well as the magnitude of the acclimation responses studied. Overall, the data here presented suggest a role for NR as NO source, influencing the signaling pathways leading to early acclimation responses following P-deprivation in soybean plants.",

In this study, we report a novel method of constructing a high-performance biocathode by modifying electrodes with zero-valent iron to enhance the enrichment and electron transfer of electroactive bacteria. The surface chemical and biological analysis of the biocathode revealed that the ZVI gradually oxidized to form magnetite and goethite, and finally stabilized into better crystallized lepidocrocite. On the other hand, the microbial community of the biocathode gradually evolved into a community dominated by denitrifying bacteria, specifically Clostridium. The co-evolved \"Clostridium-lepidocrocite\" composite endows the sediment microbial fuel cell with a 99% nitrate removal capacity. These results indicate that the cathode constructed by using ZVI modified electrode achieves efficient nitrate reduction by denitrifying bacteria.

Here, we perform a four-steps screening strategy to screen high performance NO3RR catalyst by density functional theory calculations using 23 single transition metals atom doped on 1T-WS2/graphene (TM@1T-WS2/graphene) as candidates. The results show that Cu@1T-WS2/graphene exhibits the highest NO3RR performance among 23 candidates with a low rate determining step energy barrier of 0.12 eV, which is much lower than that of the most of recently reported NO3RR catalysts. Moreover, the Cu@1T-WS2/graphene also possesses excellent NH3 selectivity by suppressing competing hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides a new avenue for the design of effective electrocatalysts for NO3RR."

      "abstract": "The excessive accumulation of nitrate/nitrite (NO x -) in surface and groundwater has severely disrupted the global nitrogen cycle and jeopardized public health. The electrochemical conversion of NO x - to ammonia (NH3) not only holds promise for ecofriendly NO x - removal, but also provides a green alternative to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process for NH3 production. Recently, in addition to the electrocatalyst design explosion in this field, many innovative valorization systems based on NO x --to-NH3 conversion have been developed for generating energy and expanding the range of value-added products. Collective knowledge of advanced conversion systems is indispensable for restoring the global nitrogen cycle and promoting a N-based economy. Herein, a timely and comprehensive review is provided on the important progress of valorization systems based on NO x - conversion, including waste treatment systems, novel electrolytic systems, and energy conversion and storage systems. Some mechanism explorations, device designs, key electrode developments and feasibility analyses are involved to gain deeper understanding of various systems and facilitate implementing these cleaning systems in industry. Finally, challenges and future prospects are outlined in the NO x - conversion field with an aim to promote large-scale electrocatalytic system development and prosperous N-based electrochemistry."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by synovial inflammation, cartilage damage, and bone loss. Although effective treatments are currently lacking, early interventions hold promise for alleviating RA symptoms. Inorganic nitrates and vitamin C (VC) are essential bioactive substances abundant in fruits and vegetables. Notably, nitrates and VC exhibit synergistic effects in a series of physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we aim to examine the combination of nitrate and VC for preventing RA in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. Nitrate partly reduced foot swelling and arthritis scores and was more effective when combined with VC. Histopathological and radiological analyses revealed that nitrate + VC treatment alleviated synovial hyperplasia and bone loss. Additionally, nitrate + VC lowered the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in serum as well as synovial tissue, decreased the expression of NF-κB and reduced the number of macrophages in synovial tissue. Compared to the CIA group, nitrate + VC decreased the levels of NLRP3 and GSDMD in macrophages, thus inhibiting pyroptosis. According to in vitro experiments, nitrate inhibited the activation of the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway in macrophages by conversion into nitrite. VC reduced the expression and phosphorylation of NF-κB in macrophages and thus reduced the expression levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. Therefore, nitrate/nitrite and VC may exert synergistic effects by blocking the interaction between NF-κB and NLRP3, further alleviating the inflammation and pyroptosis of macrophages, which provides a new strategy for RA prevention.",

In this study, MnOx/carbon (Mn-C) composites were applied in biofilters to evaluate simultaneous removal of nitrate and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), with the single carbon composites as control. Results showed that the effluent concentrations of NO3--N and SMX were below 2.87 mg L-1 and 7.97 μg L-1 under hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 h. The intermittent aeration optimized Mn cycle with treatment performance improved under lower HRT and Mn(II) accumulation decreased. Mn-C composites could reduce the emission of N2O, CO2 and CH4. The dominant genera gradually evolved from fermentation to glycogen aggregation, and from heterotrophic/sulfur autotrophic to heterotrophic denitrifiers by intracellular substance and manganese autotrophic/heterotrophic bacteria. Microbial network analysis indicated higher antagonism, lower modularity and shorter average path among microbes in Mn-C biofilters, which highlighted microbial differentiation and faster electron transfer. Improved functions of denitrification and Mn respiration, and the increasing genes encoding electron transfer chain, including NADH dehydrogenase, Cytc and ubiquinone, further elucidated the superiority of Mn-C composites. These results improved our understanding of Mn-C composites application in low-carbon wastewater treatment.",

Prior pilot studies have shown improvements in exercise tolerance with single-dose and short-term inorganic nitrate administration. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of chronic inorganic nitrate administration on exercise tolerance in a larger trial of participants with HFpEF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter randomized double-blinded crossover trial was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and Northwestern University between October 2016 and July 2022. Participants included patients with symptomatic (New York Heart Association class II/III) HFpEF who had objective signs of elevated left ventricular filling pressures. Image quantification, physiological data modeling and biochemical measurements, unblinding, and statistical analyses were completed in 2024. INTERVENTION: Potassium nitrate (KNO3) (6 mmol 3 times daily) vs equimolar doses of potassium chloride (KCl) for 6 weeks, each with a 1-week washout in between. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The coprimary end points included peak oxygen uptake and total work performed during a maximal effort incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test. Secondary end points included the exercise systemic vasodilatory reserve (ie, reduction in systemic vascular resistance with exercise) and quality of life assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighty-four participants were enrolled. Median age was 68 years and 58 participants were women (69.0%). Most participants had NYHA class II disease (69%) with a mean 6-minute walk distance of 335.5 (SD, 97.3) m. Seventy-seven participants received the KNO3 intervention and 74 received the KCl intervention. KNO3 increased trough levels of serum nitric oxide metabolites after 6 weeks (KNO3, 418.4 [SD, 26.9] uM vs KCl, 40.1 [SD, 28.3] uM; P < .001). KNO3 did not improve peak oxygen uptake (KNO3, 10.23 [SD, 0.43] mL/min/kg vs KCl, 10.17 [SD, 0.43] mL/min/kg; P = .73) or total work performed (KNO3, 25.9 [SD, 3.65] kilojoules vs KCl, 23.63 [SD, 3.63] kilojoules; P = .29). KNO3 nitrate did not improve the vasodilatory reserve or quality of life, though it was well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, potassium nitrate did not improve aerobic capacity, total work, or quality of life in participants with HFpEF.

This study aimed to quantify the salivary nitric oxide (NO), total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) levels in hypertensive individuals and healthy controls in a sub-population in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This cross-sectional study comprised 40 hypertensive patients (test group, 40-50 years old) and 40 age-matched healthy controls who visited the dental hospital in the College of Dentistry, King Khalid University, for dental treatment. Nitric oxide, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and LDL levels in saliva were assessed. An independent sample t-test was used to compare the results between the hypertensive and control groups. Results: The mean triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the test group were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the control group. Alternatively, the NO level in the test group was significantly (p = 0.014) lower than that in the controls. The triglyceride level was significantly correlated with age in the test group (p = 0.04). Conclusions: This study demonstrated significant differences in the nitrate levels and lipid profiles between hypertensive patients and healthy individuals in a sub-population in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that saliva can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing nitrate levels and the lipid profile. However, additional studies with larger sample sizes and more precise testing parameters are required to validate the findings."

Results demonstrated that process parameters, including NH₃ gas pressure, applied voltage, and treatment time, significantly influenced PAW properties, with NH₃ plasma treatment time showing the most substantial impact. Extending the treatment time from 0.5-1.5 hours increased NH4+ ion concentration by 134.2%, achieving a maximum of 168.2 mg L-¹ with an energy consumption of 74.8 mg NH4+ ions kWh-¹. The NO3- ion concentration reached 63.5 mg L-¹ with an energy yield of 222 mg NO3- ions kWh-¹. This method achieved a total yield of 27.6 mg NH4NO3 kWh-¹ and produced a neutral to slightly basic PAW suitable for agricultural applications, offering a promising alternative to traditional NH4NO3 production processes."

The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate and the oxidation of ammonia are promising strategies for converting polyvalent nitrogen into nontoxic and harmless N2. Herein, a bifunctional electrode loaded with diatomic iron-nickel site on porous N-doped carbon (FeNi-NC) is designed and successfully applied for the co-electrolysis of nitrate and ammonia. The incorporation of the Fe atom shifts the partial density of states of Ni 3d away from the Fermi level and suppresses the 3d-2π* coupling between Ni sites and superficial N2, leading to the easy desorption of N2 intermediates. Consequently, the Faradaic efficiencies of FeNi-NC for N2 production at the cathode and anode are 90.3% and 99.4% at 1.8 V, respectively, and an electricity consumption saving of 19.4% is achieved. This work provides a feasible strategy to regulate the electronic configuration of atomically dispersed catalysts for sewage treatment."

      "abstract": "Sulfur autotrophic denitrification (SADN) is regarded as a cost-effective bioremediation technology for nitrate-contaminated water. Nevertheless, the low bioavailability of sulfur is a major challenge that hinders nitrogen removal efficiency. A sulfur autotrophic disproportionation (SADP) process was proposed to convert sulfur to biogenic sulfide, greatly increasing the availability of electron donors. Throughout the 201-day laboratory-scale test, it was observed that the SADP process achieved desirable performance with 198.87 ± 39.8 mg S/L biogenic sulfide production per day, which could provide sufficient electron donors for the SADN process in treatment of 671.22 ± 134.40 mg N/L/d nitrate. Microbial community analysis confirmed the presence and dominancy of sulfur-disproportionating bacteria (SDB) (e.g., Desulfocaspa sp. taking up to 8.27% of the entire microbial community), while Thiobacillus was the most dominant genus of sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB), accounting for 87.32% of the entire community. Further experiments revealed that the addition of chemical and biogenic sulfides enhanced the nitrate removal rate of the SADN process by a factor of 1.31 and 1.34, respectively. Additionally, biogenic sulfide was found to be the most effective nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigator, reducing emission by 82% and 95% in denitrification and denitritation processes, respectively. The results demonstrated that the integrated SADP and SADN processes was a more effective and carbon-neutral alternative in treatment of nitrate-contaminated water.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The wound healing in diabetes is hindered and prolonged due to long-term inflammation, oxidative stress damage, and angiogenesis disorders induced by high glucose status. The management of such difficult-to-treat wounds continues to pose a significant challenge in clinical treatment. Dietary nitrate, commonly found in greens such as beets and spinach, acts as a nutritional supplement and is metabolized in the body through the salivary nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway. This pathway plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including enhancing blood flow and attenuating inflammation. METHODS: In this study, we established a diabetic rat wound model. Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 8): the Con group, the Con + Nitrate group, the STZ group, the STZ + NaCl group, the STZ + rhEGF group, and the STZ + Nitrate group. Skin wound healing was assessed on the day of surgery and on postoperative days 3, 7, 10, and 14. Specimens were taken on days 7 and 14 post-surgery for relevant tests. RESULTS: We found that dietary nitrate could accelerate skin wound healing by promoting angiogenesis and increasing blood perfusion. Significantly, dietary nitrate also regulated glucose and lipid metabolism and exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. DISCUSSION: These findings provide a novel theoretical basis for managing wounds in diabetic individuals, indicating the broad potential of dietary nitrate in future clinical applications."

Dissolved oxygen (DO) control is the most used strategy to prevent NO3--N accumulation, but the performance is usually unstable. This study proposes a novel strategy for controlling NO3--N accumulation based on oxygen supply rate (OSR). In comparison, limiting the OSR is more effective than limiting DO in controlling NO3--N accumulation through mathematical simulation. A laboratory-scale one-stage partial nitritation-anammox system was continuously operated for 135 days, which was divided into five stages with different OSRs. A novel deep learning model integrating Gated Recurrent Unit and Multilayer Perceptron was developed to predict NO3--N accumulation load. To tackle with the general obstacle of limited environmental samples, a generic evaluation was proposed to optimise the model structure by leveraging predictive performance and overfitting risk. The developed model successfully predicted the NO3--N accumulation in the system ten days in advance, showcasing its potential contribution to system design and performance enhancement.",

      "abstract": "Inorganic nitrate (NO3-) and nitrate-rich foods have been shown to exert antioxidative effects and lower blood pressure in experimental animal models and human clinical studies. The specific handling of nitrate, including its enterosalivary recirculation, secretion into saliva, oral microbial reduction to nitrite (NO2-), and the pH-dependent nitrosative capacity in the stomach have all been recognized as being important for nitrate's beneficial effects. Obesity is of major health concern worldwide and associated with increased cardiovascular risk; whether nitrate lowers blood pressure and improves endothelial function in this setting has not been investigated. We here tested the hypotheses that i) nitrate elicits cardiovascular benefits in overweight women; and ii) these beneficial effects would be diminished in women who underwent bariatric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Our controlled clinical trial included 15 women with prior RYGB surgery and 15 overweight female controls. All participants received a single dose of 0.1 mmol/kg/day nitrate in the form of a beetroot extract for 14 days. Blood collection, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurements and endothelial function tests were performed before and after nitrate treatment. Plasma nitrite, nitrate, and S-nitrosothiol (RSNO) concentrations were determined by ozone-based reductive chemiluminescence while thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured using plate-reader based assays. Nitrate reduced blood pressure and improved endothelial function in controls, but not in women with prior bariatric surgery. Nitrate also increased circulating nitrate/nitrite and RSNO levels in controls, but the latter was blunted following RYGB surgery despite even larger increases in nitrite concentrations. Similarly, nitrate increased antioxidant responses in controls but not in women with prior bariatric surgery. This is the first study to show that nitrate exerts beneficial cardiovascular effects in obesity and that the morphological/functional modifications elicited by RYGB surgery abrogates nitrate's effectiveness by preventing gastric RSNO formation.",

      "abstract": "Developing methods for reusing biodegradable plastics, like polylactic acid (PLA) straws, is highly needed. Here, PLAs were applied to substitute traditional commercial ceramic media (CCM) in denitrification biofilters. During long-term operation, replacing CCM with PLA significantly enhanced nitrate removal efficiency from 32.68-54.39 % to 41.64-66.26 %. Ammonia nitrogen effluent maintained below 0.5 mg/L in all reactors. PLA plastisphere shaped unique microbial communities, i.e., denitrifying bacteria Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Acidovorax preferred to inhabit or degrade PLA. Compared to CCM biofilms, PLA diminished the importance of stochastic process in biofilm assembly of PLA plastisphere. Metagenomic sequencing suggested that PLA biofilms possessed greater metabolic capabilities of denitrification and glycolysis compared to CCM. Additionally, Bacillus strain P01 isolated from PLA plastisphere demonstrated strong PLA depolymerization. Overall, this study revealed that PLA serves as carbon source and biofilm carrier, offering a promising approach to integrating plastic reuse with wastewater treatment.",

METHODS: This phase III, double-blind, randomized, two-cell, parallel-group study was conducted on 80 healthy adults in Puerto Rico. After a baseline tooth stain assessment and oral examinations, study participants were randomly assigned to either the SNaP (test) group or a negative control group. Participants brushed their teeth twice daily for 2 minutes for the 6-week duration. The efficacy for extrinsic tooth stain removal was assessed via Lobene composite stain index, stain area index, and stain intensity index scores for each treatment group at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. RESULTS: Seventy-eight participants completed the 6-week study. The SNaP dentifrice provided more stain removal relative to baseline tooth stain scores (3-week: 24.4%; 6-week: 35.6%; P less than .001) and more stain removal relative to the regular fluoride dentifrice (3-week: 24.3%; 6-week: 39.1%; P less than .001). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the SNaP toothpaste provides a greater level of efficacy in the removal of extrinsic tooth stain as compared to a regular fluoride toothpaste when used twice a day, as measured with Lobene stain index at 3 weeks and 6 weeks. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: A new stannous fluoride dentifrice stabilized with nitrate and phosphates offers greater efficacy in removing extrinsic tooth stain as compared to regular fluoride toothpaste.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dentin hypersensitivity is a global oral health concern. This in vitro study and clinical evaluation tested the efficacy of 0.454% stannous fluoride toothpaste stabilized with nitrate and phosphates (SNaP) to occlude dentin and reduce dentin hypersensitivity. METHODS: Human dentin specimens were treated with test and control toothpaste slurries and evaluated for dentin occlusion. In a phase III randomized controlled trial, eligible participants were randomized to SNaP toothpaste (test group), a potassium nitrate desensitizing dentifrice (positive control), or a non-desensitizing sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice (negative control). Baseline, day 1, day 3, and day 7 dentin hypersensitivity was assessed using tactile and air blast stimuli. Mean tactile and air blast hypersensitivity scores were calculated for each treatment group. For statistical analysis, significance was set to P ≤ .05. RESULTS: In vitro mean percent tubule occlusion for test and control samples were 86% and 35%, respectively (P less than .05). One-hundred-twenty participants completed the clinical trial. After 7 days of product use, relative to the positive control and negative control groups, the test group exhibited significant reduction in tactile hypersensitivity (79.8% and 90.2%, respectively; P less than .001) and reduction in air blast hypersensitivity (47.1% and 47.9%, respectively; P less than .001). SNaP significantly reduced hypersensitivity pain after 1, 3, and 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro and clinical evaluation results indicate that SNaP is highly effective in coating the dentin surface, occluding exposed dentin tubules, and offering sensitivity relief from the first day of use, a benefit that continues to improve with use. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This multi-benefit formula reduces dentin hypersensitivity, thereby improving the daily lives of patients, promoting better oral health, and potentially helping patients avoid more serious dental problems in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stannous fluoride has long been an effective antibacterial, anticaries, antisensitivity, and antigingivitis addition to toothpaste formulas. However, in the past its chemical properties in aqueous solution have made it difficult to stabilize with desirable results. The recent development of a novel formulation of 0.454% stannous fluoride stabilized with nitrate and phosphates (SNaP) has resulted in prolonged therapeutic effect without compromising product experience and esthetics. METHODS: Dentifrice antibacterial performance in vitro was determined through bacterial bioenergetics measured via rate of oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification in real-time comparing the SNaP toothpaste, a stannous fluoride positive control toothpaste, a non-antibacterial negative control toothpaste, and no treatment. Also, a single- center, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, clinical investigation of 98 subjects was performed to analyze dentifrice antibacterial performance in vivo following twice daily treatment with SNaP toothpaste (n = 48) and non-antibacterial control toothpaste (n = 50). Oral microenvironments, including plaque, tongue, cheek, gum, and saliva, of study participants 12 hours post-brushing were analyzed for bacterial load at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. RESULTS: In vitro treatment of biofilms with SNaP toothpaste resulted in significant suppression of bacterial respiration and glycolysis compared to a positive control, negative control, and no treatment. In the clinical trial, treatment with SNaP toothpaste showed significantly lower bacterial load in all oral microenvironments 12 hours post-brushing after 2 weeks (all: P less than .01) and 4 weeks (all: P less than .05) compared to non-antibacterial negative control toothpaste. Compared to baseline, SNaP toothpaste significantly reduced bacteria from tongue (P = .007) and saliva (P less than .001) at week 2, and from all microenvironments by week 4 (all: P ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS: SNaP toothpaste provided significantly greater and more sustained antibacterial effects than other tested toothpastes. Stannous fluoride, when stabilized in the SNaP formulation, effectively inhibited bacterial respiration and glycolysis in saliva-derived in vitro biofilms. The specific stabilization strategy used in SNaP toothpaste is critical for the antibacterial performance of stannous fluoride, as this formulation was more effective at reducing bacterial metabolic activity than a toothpaste containing the same amount of stannous fluoride stabilized with gluconate. The clinical study supports the in vitro findings by showing that the regular use of SNaP toothpaste leads to a significant and prolonged reduction in viable bacterial counts of five oral microenvironments. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The highly stabilized stannous ion in SNaP toothpaste confers potent, sustained antibacterial activity that can contribute to improved oral hygiene and potentially reduce the risk of tooth decay, early gum disease, calculus, and halitosis, which have been linked to oral bacteria.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To ensure higher productivity, fertilizers have been excessively applied to the fruit greenhouse soil yearly, thus resulting in the increasing risks of residual nitrate leaching in the North China Plain. METHODS: In this study, a water and solute transport HYDRUS-1D model was used to evaluate the effects of using sweet corn as a catch crop on deep water drainage and nitrate leaching in a sweet cherry greenhouse soil. A three-year (2019-2021) field experiment was conducted during the rainfall season from July to September in the post-harvest of sweet cherry, when the plastic cover was removed each year. In the experiment, the five treatments were designed. The three nitrate residue levels denoted by CKR, N1R, and N2R, represented nitrate residue amounts in the soil profile of three nitrogen fertilizer levels(0, 280 and 420kg ha-1) before the harvest of sweet cherry(March to June). Two other treatments with and without sweet corn as a catch crop based on the treatments of N1R and N2R were denoted by N1RC and N2RC, respectively. The data of both the spatial and temporal distribution of water and nitrate content during the rainy seasons of 2019, 2020 and 2021 in the field experiment were collected to calibrate and validate the model. RESULTS: The simulated results have showed that using sweet corn as a catch crop increased the evapotranspiration rate, the upward flux of water and nitrate at a 100 cm soil depth reached a maximum of 1.5 mm d-1 and 1.0 kg N ha-1d-1, respectively, and the downward movement of water and nitrate leached to deeper soil layers was reduced. Compared with CKR, the treatments with catch crops (N1RC and N2RC) reduced the amount of water drainage by 16.4% -47.7% in the 0-180cm soil profile. The average amounts of nitrate leaching in the 1.8 m soil profile during the three-year experiment were 88.1, 113.3, and 58.2 kg N ha-1 for the treatment without catch crop (N1R and N2R) and 32.3, 54.8, and 31.4 kg N ha-1 for the treatment with catch crop (N1RC and N2RC), respectively. The treatments (N1RC and N2RC) with catch crops decreased the amount of nitrate leaching by 29.6%-69.1% compared with the treatments without catch crops (N1R and N2R). DISCUSSION: Sweet corn as summer catch crop can reduce nitrate leaching in the sweet cherry greenhouses. Our study has provided an effective method to reduce the risk of nitrate leaching for sweet cherry greenhouses in the North China Plain."
