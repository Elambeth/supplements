      "abstract": "Carbon quantum dots (CQD) are an emergent nanomaterial with unique optical and biological properties. However, the purification of CQD is one of the bottlenecks that makes it difficult to scale for application in different areas. In this work, we explore for the first time the potential of centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) as an alternative preparative technology to achieve the purification of CQD at the gram scale. The hydrothermal method was used to synthesize CQD from avocado peels. After 6 h at 250 °C, a complex mix of strong blue-fluorescent CQDs were obtained and submitted to CPC fractionation without pretreatment. The best results were obtained with the solvent system n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:2:1:2, v/v/v/v), in an elution-extrusion protocol. Nine fractions were obtained and were characterized by UV-VIS spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared (F-TIR), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), confirming the presence of CQD of different sizes. CPC fractionations indicate that a polarity-based separation mechanism can be used to purify CQD. Interestingly, four fractions showed antibacterial and anti-biofilm effects on Pseudomonas putida and Listeria monocytogenes. Therefore, CPC allows for better refining of this type of nanomaterial, and in combination with other techniques, it would serve to obtain CQD of higher purity, facilitating the physicochemical and bioactivity characterization of these particles. CPC would also allow the use of waste, such as avocado peels, to obtain new materials.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Prevotella intermedia is a significant contributor to periodontitis, capable of forming biofilms that resist antibiotics and complicate treatment. Avocado seeds (Persea americana Mill.) are rich in bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, tannins, saponins, and alkaloids, which exhibit potential antibiofilm activity. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of avocado seed ethanol extract in preventing biofilm attachment, inhibiting biofilm formation, and eradicating established biofilms of P. intermedia in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A post-test-only control group design was employed using P. intermedia (ATCC 25611). Ten groups were included: Bacterial and negative controls, a positive control (chlorhexidine), and experimental groups with ethanol extract concentrations (3.25%-9.25%). Biofilm activity was assessed using 96-well microtiter plates, crystal violet staining, and optical density measurements at 595 nm to determine the minimum biofilm prevention (MBPC), inhibition (MBIC), and eradication concentrations (MBEC). Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests. RESULTS: Biofilm assays showed a dose-dependent increase in antibiofilm efficacy. The highest attachment prevention (82.67%), biofilm formation inhibition (84.26%), and biofilm eradication (86.04%) were observed at 9.25%. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between the extract and negative control groups, with no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the 8.25%-9.25% extracts and chlorhexidine. The MBPC50, MBIC50, and MBEC50 were identified at a concentration of 6.25%, achieving >50% efficacy in biofilm prevention, inhibition, and eradication. CONCLUSION: Avocado seed ethanol extract demonstrated significant antibiofilm properties against P. intermedia, comparable to chlorhexidine at higher concentrations. The bioactive compounds - flavonoids, tannins, saponins, and alkaloids - likely contributed to these effects through mechanisms such as quorum sensing inhibition, disruption of bacterial adhesion, and destabilization of biofilm structures. These findings highlight avocado seed extract as a promising natural alternative for managing periodontitis-related biofilm infections."

Conventional pasteurization (CP), high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), ultrasound (US), and a combination of US and HHP (US + HHP) were the processing treatments assayed. Fresh blended puree was used as control (CTRL). A shelf-life study of 22 days at 4 °C was performed where physicochemical properties, microbial load, free polyphenol content (FPC), and carotenoid content were periodically assessed. RESULTS: HHP treatment preserved colour stability (by ~50-75% compared to the remaining treatments) and decreased microbial load (by 2-4 log CFU g-1), while US was less successful for this purpose. Phenolics and carotenoids were highly retained by encapsulation, and samples treated with HHP preserved the greatest amounts by approximately 25-35% compared to CTRL. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the developed avocado puree is improved throughout the shelf-life using a non-thermal HHP processing combined with the supplementation of encapsulated biocompounds from tomato by-products. This opens an opportunity to revalorize horticultural by-products as possible functional ingredients into novel food matrices. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Avocado Sign, a novel contrast-enhancement-based MR imaging marker, for prognostication of mesorectal lymph node spread in rectal cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study included 106 patients with rectal cancer who underwent MRI examination. The Avocado Sign, defined as a hypointense core within an otherwise homogeneously hyperintense lymph node on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, was assessed. Of the cohort, 77 patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by restaging MRI. Histopathological examination served as the reference standard. Diagnostic metrics were calculated and compared between subgroups using chi-square tests. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: The Avocado Sign demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for predicting lymph node involvement, with an overall sensitivity of 88.7%, specificity of 84.9%, PPV of 85.5%, NPV of 88.2%, and accuracy of 86.8%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.87. Subgroup analysis revealed excellent performance in both patients undergoing surgery alone (sensitivity 100%, specificity 83.3%) and those receiving neoadjuvant therapy (sensitivity 84.2%, specificity 85.4%). Interobserver agreement was almost perfect (κ = 0.92). CONCLUSION: The Avocado Sign is a promising imaging predictor for mesorectal lymph node status in rectal cancer. Its straightforward application, high reproducibility, and remarkable diagnostic accuracy underline its potential to refine MRI staging. However, further validation in larger, prospective multicenter studies is warranted to confirm these findings and assess their impact on clinical decision-making. KEY POINTS: Question Can the Avocado Sign on contrast-enhanced MRI improve mesorectal lymph node staging in rectal cancer independently of classical morphological criteria? Findings The Avocado Sign demonstrated high sensitivity (88.7%) and specificity (84.9%) as a standalone marker for predicting mesorectal lymph node involvement. Clinical relevance Incorporating contrast-enhanced sequences and the Avocado Sign into MRI protocols enhances nodal staging accuracy in rectal cancer, potentially informing treatment decisions. Further validation is required to confirm its effectiveness and compare it with existing criteria."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This scoping review evaluates the breadth of research on avocado intake and health, considering all populations and health outcomes (registered on Open Science Foundation at https://osf.io/nq5hk). DESIGN: Any human intervention or observational study where effects could be isolated to consumption of avocado were included. A systematic literature search through April 2024 was conducted (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL) and supplemented by backwards citation screening. Dual screening, data extraction, and conflict resolution were performed by three reviewers and an interactive evidence map was created. RESULTS: After deduplication, 8,823 unique records were retrieved; 58 articles met inclusion criteria, comprising 45 unique studies (28 interventions, 17 observational studies). Studies were largely conducted in the United States or Latin America and generally included adults, with overweight/obesity, frequently with elevated lipid concentrations. Interventions assessed the impact of diets enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids, diets higher/lower in carbohydrates, or in free-feeding conditions. Larger amounts of avocados were used in interventions than commonly consumed in observational studies (60-300 vs. 0-10 g/d, respectively). Blood lipids, nutrient bioavailability, cardiovascular risk, glycemia, and anthropometric variables were the most common outcomes reported across all studies. CONCLUSION: Future recommendations for novel research include the study of: European, Asian, adolescent or younger, and senior populations; dose-response designs and longer length interventions; dietary compensation; and the need for greater replication. The results have been made public and freely available, and a visual, interactive map was created to aid in science translation. This evidence map should enable future meta-analyses, enhance communication and transparency in avocado research, and serve as a resource for policy guidance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of single food-based dietary interventions on the American Heart Association's cardiovascular health score, Life's Essential 8 (LE8), is unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of daily avocado intake for 26 weeks on LE8 in adults with abdominal obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: An ancillary analysis including participants (n=969; aged 51±14 years) from the HAT (Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial), a randomized controlled trial, was conducted. The Avocado-Supplemented Diet Group was provided with 1 avocado per day, and the Habitual Diet Group was instructed to maintain their usual diet. LE8 component scores (diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep health, body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure) were calculated using a modified American Heart Association algorithm. The LE8 score was calculated as the unweighted average of each component (range, 0-100 points). Between-group differences in the 26-week change in LE8 were assessed using general linear models. No significant between-group difference in the 26-week change in the LE8 score from baseline was observed (0.79 points [95% CI, -0.41 to 2.00]). However, avocado intake increased the LE8 component scores for diet (3.53 points [95% CI, 1.38-5.68]), sleep health (3.20 points [95% CI, 0.38-6.02]), and blood lipids (3.46 points [95% CI, 1.03-5.90]) compared with the Habitual Diet Group. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of 1 avocado per day for 26 weeks did not significantly affect the total cardiovascular health score in US adults with abdominal obesity. However, diet quality, sleep health, and blood lipids improved with daily avocado intake. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03528031.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impact of a healthy diet on the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke (IS) remains uncertain. Levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are inversely associated with the risk of IS recurrence. A Mediterranean diet (MeDi), consisting of a preference for fish/poultry, monosaturated fats from olive oil, fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes/nuts and limited red meats, animal fats and sweetened beverages, reduces metabolic syndrome, LDL-C levels and stroke risk. Avocados also reduce metabolic syndrome and LDL-C levels but are not part of the traditional MeDi diet. The effects of an avocado-based Mediterranean diet on LDL-C were investigated and compared to those of a low-fat diet in patients with previous IS. METHODS: The Avocado-Based Mediterranean Diet on Serum Lipids for Secondary Prevention after Ischemic Stroke (ADD-SPISE) was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded outcome assessment, phase 2, clinical trial. The participants were adults with an IS in the previous month who were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to a MeDi or a low-fat diet for three months. Outcome assessors of laboratory results and data analysts were masked. The primary outcome was the mean difference in LDL-C between groups at 90 days, adjusted by statin use. Safety, feasibility and acceptability (assessed through a 14-item questionnaire administered to all patients who completed the follow-up) were also evaluated. RESULTS: From August 2018 to October 2022, 200 participants were enrolled (97 randomized to the low-fat diet and 103 to the MeDi), with 189 (94.5%) completing the study. There were no significant differences in LDL-C levels between the MeDi group and the low-fat group at 90 days: 66.5 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI] 59.6, 73.4) in the MeDi group and 69.9 mg/dL (62.6, 77.2) in the low-fat group at the end of follow-up. The adjusted difference was - 3.4 mg/dL (-13.4, -6.62); P = 0.50. The intervention group showed significant improvements in Mediterranean diet adherence (P < 0.01). Moreover, no significant differences in adverse events were observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with a low-fat diet, the avocado-based MeDi did not significantly lower LDL-C in IS patients after three months. The intervention was safe, feasible, and well accepted. Larger trials should establish whether longer dietary interventions could yield clinically significant benefits in these patients. The study is registered under ADD-SPISE at www.

Four this, 24 male rats were divided into four groups (n = 6): the first group served as a control, the second served as a fibrotic group, instilled intratracheally only with BLM (2 mg/kg bw), and the remaining groups were treated by gastric gavage with Ao at different doses (3.5 and 5 mL/kg bw) for 25 days after BLM instillation. The fibrosis induction revealed significant alterations, including increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxyde dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), level of thiols group coupled with a high fibrosis score (FS) and an inflammatory index (II), along with excessive collagen deposition in the pulmonary interstitium. Ao treatment reversed all disturbances induced by BLM in oxidative stress parameters and relatively repairs the histological damage caused by BLM by reducing the FS and the II. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis power of Ao, may suggest this last as a promising candidate for the treatment of PF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Avocado intake has been associated with improvements in diet quality. Whether this response is because of avocado intake, per se, or combined with a food and/or nutrient displacement (D) has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVES: This secondary analysis, conducted using dietary data from the Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial, sought to assess the effect of consuming a large avocado (168 g, 281 kcal) daily in the avocado-supplemented diet (AD) group compared with the habitual diet (HD) group on food and nutrient D. METHODS: Using data from 3 unannounced telephone 24-h dietary recalls conducted during the 6-mo intervention period, food intake data were evaluated for 898 participants, aged 25-87 y, and a BMI range of 20.5-60.3 kg/m2. The food group distribution, energy, and nutrient intake of the AD group (n = 436) were calculated and compared with those of the HD group (n = 462). RESULTS: The AD group had a higher daily intake of energy (159 ± 575 kcal) (P < 0.001), potassium (3193 ± 817 mg compared with 2419 ± 843 mg) (P < 0.005), fiber (30 ± 8 g compared with 19 ± 9 g) (P < 0.05), and a lower daily intake of animal protein (49 ± 33 g compared with 55 ± 24 g) (P = 0.02) compared with the HD group. Partial D with an avocado was observed for energy (43%), total fat (23%), and carbohydrate (87%), indicating a lower intake of these nutrients from non-avocado sources in the AD group. Food group analysis revealed a lower consumption of animal-derived protein from red meat, processed meats, poultry, and fish in the AD group, with no significant differences observed in dairy and egg intake between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating 1 avocado daily led to favorable modifications in the dietary composition of participants, including an increase in potassium and fiber intake, which can improve diet quality.This trial was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03528031."

      "abstract": "Recent research has shown that Avocado-Soybean Unsaponifiables (ASU) greatly reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA). It's yet unknown exactly how ASU works, however, it has been demonstrated to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. These qualities can potentially lessen the need for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) and their secondary effects. This review aims to examine the current literature on ASU, focusing on their efficacy, mechanism of action, and potential utility in treating OA for managing chronic pain associated with this condition. The literature review was conducted manually through Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) databases, covering studies from 2000 to 2022 with terms like \"osteoarthritis,\" \"OA,\" \"animal models,\" \"ASU,\" and \"soy/avocado.\" Two reviewers independently screened each article using inclusion and exclusion criteria and categorized the studies into in vitro, preclinical, and clinical groups. According to in vitro research, ASU affect the regulation of molecules related to OA, increasing structural elements like collagen and aggrecan and decreasing pro-inflammatory mediators. Although results vary, pre-clinical research in different animal models has demonstrated positive effects, such as ameliorating histopathological changes and reduced inflammation. Despite some discrepancies regarding structural changes in the joints, clinical trials typically demonstrate symptom relief and slow down the disease progression. While ASU demonstrates significant promise in alleviating OA symptoms and reducing reliance on NSAIDs, further research is essential to fully understand its mechanisms of action. More studies are needed to determine the precise pathways through which ASU exerts its effects and to establish the most effective dosages for its administration, either alone or in combination with other treatments."

Methods: HAT was a multisite, randomized controlled trial conducted between 2018 and 2020. Participants in the Avocado-Supplemented Diet Group were provided with and instructed to consume one avocado/day (~2.2 servings) for 6 months; participants in the Habitual Diet Group were instructed to follow their usual diet and limit intake to ≤2 avocados/month. Avocado consumption was assessed using three random 24 h dietary recalls administered by dietitians. This analysis focused on women who self-identified as Hispanic/Latina. Results: Within HAT, 158 females self-identified as Hispanic/Latina (median age: 42 years, IQR: 36-54). Across the dietary recalls, the Avocado-Supplemented Group (n = 80) consumed 1.9-2.1 avocado servings/day; the Habitual Diet Group (n = 78) consumed 0.04-0.09 servings/day (p < 0.001). The weight and waist circumference measurements were similar between groups. Hispanic/Latina females remained adherent to daily avocado consumption for the 6-month study period, without a significant change in their body weight or waist circumference measurements. Conclusions: Integrating a culturally preferred food into a dietary intervention enhanced adherence amongst Latina adults, with no impact significant impact on body composition.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to investigate short-term and long-term impact of avocado consumption without caloric restriction on the gut microbiota of free-living adults with abdominal obesity. Methods: The Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial (HAT) was a 26-week, multi-center, randomized, controlled trial involving 1008 individuals with abdominal obesity. Participants were randomly assigned to the Avocado Supplemented Diet Group (AVO), receiving one avocado per day, or the Habitual Diet group (HAB), maintaining their usual dietary habits. Fecal samples were collected at baseline, week 4 and week 26 from a subset of participants recruited at a University of California Los Angeles site (n = 230). Fecal microbiota was assessed with shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Alpha diversity was assessed using the Chao1 and Shannon indices; beta diversity was assessed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity with significance determined by repeated measures permutational multivariat analysis of variance. Potential association of intervention at week 4 and 26 with alpha diversity, species and metabolic pathways was examined using linear mixed effect models. Results: Compared to the HAB group, the AVO group had higher alpha diversity by 4 weeks, which persisted through the 26-week study period. Exploratory analysis based on healthy eating index-2015 (HEI-2015) indicated that participants with a low HEI score at baseline (≤52.7), had an increase in alpha diversity in the AVO group vs. HAB group. The AVO group had a significant change in beta diversity at week 26 compared to the HAB group. At the species level, the AVO group had significantly increased Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacterium AF16_15 at week 26 compared to the HAB group. Functional analysis showed no significant difference in metabolic pathways between the HAB and AVO groups. Conclusions: Our findings document a potentially favorable effect of avocados on gut microbiota diversity. The prebiotic potential of avocados is more pronounced in individuals with a low diet quality score. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03528031 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03528031).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sorafenib-resistant (SR) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a current serious problem in liver cancer treatment. Numerous phytochemicals derived from plants exhibit anticancer activity but have never been tested against drug-resistant cells. METHODS: Avocado seed extract (APE) isolated by maceration was analysed for its phytochemical composition and anticancer activity. Novel design charge-switchable pH-responsive nanocarriers of aminated mesoporous silica nanoparticles with conjugated galactose (GMSN) were synthesised for delivering APE and their physicochemical properties were characterized. The drug loading efficiency (%LE) and entrapment efficiency (%EE) were evaluated. Anticancer activity of APE loaded GMSN was measured against HCC (HepG2, Huh-7) and SR-HCC (SR-HepG2). RESULTS: Anticancer activity of APE against non-resistant HepG2 (IC50 50.9 ± 0.83 μg mL-1), Huh-7 (IC50 42.41 ± 1.88 μg mL-1), and SR-HepG2 (IC50 62.58 ± 2.29 μg mL-1) cells was confirmed. The APE loaded GMSN had a diameter of 131.41 ± 14.41 nm with 41.08 ± 2.09%LE and 44.96 ± 2.26%EE. Galactose functionalization (55%) did not perturb the original mesoporous structure. The GMSN imparted positive surface charges, 10.3 ± 0.61mV at acidic medium pH 5.5 along with rapid release of APE 45% in 2 h. The GMSN boosted cellular uptake by HepG2 and SR-HepG2 cells, whereas the amine functionalized facilitated their endosomal escape. Their anticancer activity was demonstrated in non-resistant HCC and SR-HCC cells with IC50 values at 30.73 ± 3.14 (HepG2), 21.86 ± 0.83 (Huh-7), 35.64 ± 1.34 (SR-HepG2) μg mL-1, respectively, in comparison to the control and non-encapsulated APE. CONCLUSION: APE loaded GMSN is highly effective against both non-resistant HCC and SR-HCC and warrants further in vivo investigation.",

Human actions are the primary factor behind the surge in CO2 levels, contributing to two-thirds of the greenhouse effect over the past decade. This study focuses on the chemical activation of avocado seeds with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The influence of various preparation methods was studied under the same parameters: carbon precursor to NaOH mass ratio, carbonization temperature, and nitrogen flow. For two samples, preliminary thermal treatment was applied (500 °C). NaOH was used in the form of a saturated solution as well as dry NaOH. The same temperature of 850 °C of carbonization combined with chemical activation was applied for all samples. The applied modifications resulted in the following textural parameters: specific surface area from 696 to 1217 m2/g, total pore volume from 0.440 to 0.761 cm3/g, micropore volume from 0.159 to 0.418 cm3/g. The textural parameters were estimated based on nitrogen sorption at -196 °C. The XRD measurements and SEM pictures were also performed. CO2 adsorption was performed at temperatures of 0, 10, 20, and 30 °C and pressure up to 1 bar. In order to calculate the CO2 selectivity over N2 nitrogen adsorption at 20 °C was investigated. The highest CO2 adsorption (4.90 mmol/g) at 1 bar and 0 °C was achieved."

      "abstract": "Avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is a subtropical climacteric fruit with a limited shelf life due to its high sensitivity to low temperatures. Chilling injury (CI) produced by cold storage displays symptoms in avocado fruit such as irregular ripening, darkening of the mesocarp, hardening of vascular strands, lipid oxidation with \"off flavors\", and pitting and darkening of the skin, increasing weight loss. Accordingly, we studied the effect of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) alone or in combination as postharvest treatments to maintain quality and to increase cold tolerance. Hass avocados were stored at 5 °C plus 5 days at room temperature. The results showed that the combined treatment improved fruit quality parameters as compared with control fruit and with those treated with only 1-MCP or GABA. The combined treatment delayed synergistically the postharvest ripening process. This delayed pattern was concomitant with a delayed ethylene pattern in GABA + 1-MCP or 1-MCP fruit batches. CI symptoms and electrolyte leakage were minimized in all GABA and 1-MCP fruit batches specifically in the combined treatment. For this reason, the synergistic effect of the combination of treatments may be recommended as an effective alternative strategy to prolong the postharvest quality of avocado during refrigerated storage."

      "abstract": "The accumulation of chromium in renal tissues promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress, genomic and cellular harm, and ultimately necrotic and apoptotic cell death induced by free radicals. Hence, the utilization of antioxidant phytochemicals becomes crucial for cellular defense against oxidative damage. This study endeavors to explore the potential protective effects of an aqueous avocado seed extract (ASE) on rabbit kidneys exposed to chromium-induced damage. Fifteen adult rabbits were distributed into three groups: Group 1 was kept as the control. The second and third groups received a daily dose of K2Cr2O7 (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 2 weeks. While the third group was given an oral dose of ASE (400 mg/kg). In rabbits administered with Cr (VI), kidney homogenates showed a marked increase in Malondialdehyde (MDA) (69.3 ± 4.1 nmol/g) along with a decrease in glutathione (59 ± 5.8 nmol/mg) content and the activity superoxide dismutase (SOD) (0.5 ± 0.05 U/mg protein), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (16.7 ± 1.1 μmol/mg protein), and catalase (CAT) (73.8 ± 3.9 U/g protein) compared to the levels in control group. Also, the gene expression data for the enzymes SOD, GPx, and CAT dropped dramatically in kidney tissue following Cr (VI) injection. Additionally, Bowman's capsule and glomerulus showed degenerative alterations in the kidney's histopathology and immunohistochemistry. ASE treatment when administered along with Cr (VI) enhanced the activity and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and improved histopathological conditions. The findings of this study unequivocally show that avocado seed extract, which is rich in phenolic derivatives, is a potent nephroprotective agent that inhibits nephrotoxicity induced by Cr (VI) in rabbits."

OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of consuming 1 avocado/d relative to habitual diet (HAB) on RBC-FA profiles, and their association with visceral adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs) in individuals with abdominal obesity. METHODS: RBC-FA profiling at baseline, 3- and 6 mo was conducted in participants (n = 994) from the Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial (HAT). HAT was a multisite, free-living, parallel-arm intervention study in which participants were randomly assigned to either the avocado-supplemented group (AVO, usual diet with 1 avocado/d) or the HAB group (usual diet with limited avocado intake) for 6 mo. Changes in RBC-FA profiles, a secondary outcome measure, were determined within and between groups using linear regression and mixed effect models, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, clinical site, smoking status, and percentage of energy intake from fat at baseline. The association between changes in RBC-FAs with visceral adiposity measures and CMRFs was assessed after covariate and False Discovery Rate (FDR <0.05) adjustment. RESULTS: No major differences in RBC-FA profiles were observed between groups, with the exception of MUFA cis-vaccenic [18:1n-7c], which was significantly higher in AVO (β: 0.11 [0.05, 0.17]) compared with the HAB (β: 0.03 [-0.03, 0.08]) participants. In the HAB but not AVO group, increases in MUFA cis (18:1n-7c, oleic [18;1n-9c], erucic [22:1n-9c]) and MUFA trans (palmitelaidic [16:1n-7t], vaccenic [18:1n-7t], elaidic [18:1n-9t], and petroselaidic [18;1n-10-12t), as well as PUFA γ-linolenic [18:3n-6], dihomo-γ-linolenic [20:3n-6], arachidonic [20:4n-6], and α-linolenic [18:3n-3] were associated with unfavorable changes in visceral adiposity measures, lipid profiles, glucose, insulin and high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Daily avocado intake over 6-mo modified RBC-MUFA composition, notably 18:1n-7c, and potentially mitigated some of the unfavorable individual RBC-FA-CMRF associations observed over time in the HAB group.

This review explores, through a comparative approach, the effectiveness of the supercritical oil extraction process as an alternative to the conventional cold-pressing method, evaluating the differences in the extraction process steps through the effect of temperature and operating pressure on bioactive quality and oil yield. The results reveal that supercritical avocado oil has a yield like that of mechanical cold pressing and superior functional and bioactive quality, especially in relation to α-tocopherol and carotenoids. For better use and efficiency of the supercritical technology, the maturation stage, moisture content, fruit variety, and collection period stand out as essential factors to be observed during pre-treatment, as they directly impact oil yield and nutrient concentration. In addition, the use of supercritical technology enables the full use of the fruit, significantly reducing waste, and adds value to the agro-industrial residues of the process. It produces an edible oil free of impurities, microorganisms, and organic solvents. It is a green, environmentally friendly technology with long-term environmental and economic advantages and an interesting alternative in the avocado market."

      "abstract": "Avocado fruit is a rich source of phytonutrients such as vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, carbohydrates, polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids. However, due to its climacteric nature, fruits are highly susceptible to storage temperature, resulting in poor shelf life and reduced quality. In the present study avocado fruits (Accession CHES-HA-I/I) were stored at different low temperatures (5, 9 and 12 °C with 90-95% relative humidity, RH) to identify optimum low temperature for cold storage. In a further experiment, avocado fruits were treated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 500 ppb) and chitosan (0.5%) to extend the shelf life with better fruit quality. The results showed that storage temperatures had significant effect on physiological, biochemical and antioxidant activities of fruits. Lower physiological loss in weight (PLW), reduced respiration and ethylene production, and higher carbohydrates, protein and fat content were recorded in fruits stored at 9 °C as compared to 12 °C. Similarly, maximum antioxidant properties in terms of free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) was found in avocado fruits stored at 9 °C. It was also noticed that chilling injury was developed in fruits stored under 5 °C. In addition, exogenous application of 1-MCP significantly reduced respiration and ethylene production rate at 9 °C and extended the shelf life up to 42 days with better fruit quality and more antioxidant activities. However, chitosan treated and control fruits had shelf life up to 28 and 21 days respectively, with minimum nutritional content. From this study it is concluded that a storage temperature of 9 °C and 1-MCP treatment significantly enhanced the shelf life of avocado fruits with better fruit quality as compared to other storage temperatures (5 and 12 °C) and postharvest treatment (chitosan).",

Periodontitis was induced by ligatures, maintained for 15 days. Subsequently, the treatment was performed by scaling with hand instruments. The SS and ASU were administered daily by gavage until euthanasia of the animals that occurred at 7, 15 or 30 days after the scaling procedure (N.=5 animals/group). Bone resorption, inflammatory infiltrate composition, and osteoclastogenesis were assessed. RESULTS: The AR-S group had greater bone loss, smaller amounts of fibroblasts and larger amounts of inflammatory cells than all other groups. In addition, the AR-S group had greater osteoclastogenesis in relation to the healthy animal groups.

      "abstract": "The consumption of avocados and their products has been linked to outbreaks of illness caused by Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes. These pathogens have been isolated from avocados collected from farms and markets. After contact with the avocado epicarp, the cells of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes can become loosely attached (LA) by suspension in a film of water and attraction by electrostatic forces, or strongly attached (SA) by physical and irreversible attachment mechanisms. Attached cells may have greater resistance to agents used to decontaminate the fruit. The effect of applying wet steam (WS) to the epicarp of Hass avocados on the reduction LA and SA counts of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes was evaluated as a function of the exposure time. The inoculated avocados were washed and exposed to WS for 30, 45, and 60 s inside a treatment chamber. Salmonella was found to be more susceptible to WS than L. monocytogenes. The efficacy of steam in reducing LA and SA cell numbers was similar for both pathogens. Steaming avocados for 60 s reduced LA Salmonella and L. monocytogenes cells by 4.6 and 4.8 log CFU/avocado, whereas SA cells were decreased by 5.2 and 4.4 log CFU/avocado, respectively.•Steaming the avocados for 60 s produced the greatest reduction in loosely and strongly attached cells for both pathogens.•Wet steam treatment efficiently eliminated the loosely and strongly attached cells of both pathogens.•The Listeria monocytogenes attached cells showed greater resistance to steam treatment than Salmonella."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of joint dysfunction and disability in the elderly, posing serious social problems and a huge socio-economic burden. Existing pharmacological treatments have significant drawbacks, and searching for an effective pharmacological intervention is an urgent priority. Recent studies have demonstrated the chondroprotective, anabolic, and anti-catabolic properties of avocado-soybean unsaponifiable (ASU), a natural plant extract made from avocado and soybean oils, consisting of the remainder of the saponified portion of the product that cannot be made into soap. The main components of ASU are phytosterols, beta-sitosterol, canola stanols, and soya stanols, which are rapidly incorporated into cells. Studies have confirmed the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic properties of phytosterols. ASU slows down the progression of OA primarily by inhibiting pathways involved in the development of OA disease. ASU prevents cartilage degradation by inhibiting the release and activity of matrix metalloproteinases and by increasing the tissue inhibition of these catabolic enzymes; ASU is also involved in the inhibition of the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) which is a transcriptional inhibitor that regulates the inflammatory response of chondrocytes. NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates the inflammatory response of chondrocytes, and inhibition of the transfer of the transcription factor NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus regulates the transcription of many pro-inflammatory factors. By appealing to the mechanism of action and thus achieving anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic, and pro-synthetic effects on cartilage tissues, AUS is clinically responsive to the reduction of acute pain and OA symptom progression. This paper aims to summarize the studies on the use of avocado-soybean unsaponifiable in the pharmacological treatment of osteoarticular.",

      "abstract": "Stem-end rot (SER) causes brown necrotic lesions in the pulp near the base of the fruit pedicel and is one of the most devastating postharvest diseases of avocados in all avocado-growing regions of the world. China's avocado industry is growing very rapidly, and the planting area is expanding, but little is known about the pathogens and genetic diversity of avocado SER. To determine the causal agents of SER, avocado fruits were sampled from the main avocado-producing areas in China during 2020 and 2021. Fungal isolates were obtained from SER symptomatic avocado fruits and identified by morphology combined with phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-α (EF1-α), and β-tubulin (TUB2) gene sequences. All 101 isolates belonged to Lasiodiplodia spp.; four Lasiodiplodia species were identified, namely, L. pseudotheobromae (59.41%), L. theobromae (24.75%), L. mahajangana (7.92%), and L. euphorbiaceicola (1.98%); and six others are classified as Lasiodiplodia sp. (5.94%). There were only slight morphological differences in colonies and conidia of these four species of Lasiodiplodia. The pathogenicity tests showed symptoms of SER, and 92.08% of the isolates exhibited a high level of virulence on avocado (disease index >70), related to the disease severity on avocado fruits. All tested isolates grew well under the temperature ranging from 23 to 33°C. There was a significant difference in mycelial growth between the four species of Lasiodiplodia after treatment with high or low temperatures. The growth of L. pseudotheobromae was the fastest at 13 to 18°C but was the lowest at 38°C (P < 0.05). The red pigment could be produced by all tested isolates after culturing for 7 days at 38°C. The mycelial growth rate was the fastest on PDA medium, and the slowest on the OMA medium but promoted spore formation (P < 0.05). In addition, the genetic diversity of pathogenic Lasiodiplodia species associated with SER collected from avocado, mango, guava, and soursop fruits was determined. A total of 74 isolates were clustered into four main ISSR groups by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean analysis, and the classification of this group was related to the host. Extensive diversity was detected in the Lasiodiplodia populations. The diverse geographical origins and host species significantly influenced the population differentiation, and most of the genetic variation occurred within populations (P < 0.001). This is the first study to identify the major pathogens of avocado SER in China, survey their occurrence and pathogenicity, and include a comparative analysis of genetic diversity with Lasiodiplodia spp. causing SER on other fruit hosts. Collectively, the Lasiodiplodia species complex affecting avocado showed high pathogenicity and diversity, while L. pseudotheobromae was the most frequently isolated species in China. The results of this study provide insights into the aspects of the epidemic of SER disease caused by Lasiodiplodia species, which will help in developing strategies for the management and control of SER in avocado.",

Samples were adjusted to 30 % (w/w) moisture and 2, 4 and 8 % AO. HMT was conducted at 110 °C for 1 h in the autoclave (A0%, A2%, A4%, and A8%) and at 50 °C for 3 min in the microwave (M0%, M2%, M4%, and M8%). Both procedures did not alter the starch crystallinity pattern (type-A). Pasting viscosity, setback, relative crystallinity, and gelatinisation enthalpy decreased as the AO content increased in both HMT processes. The M8% showed reduced digestibility, decreased eGI (72.99, p < 0.05), and lower starch hydrolysis concentration (62.75 %, p < 0.05). The application of HMT with the addition of AO may be an interesting process for obtaining resistant starch since its content increased after both treatments (A8%, M4%, and M8%). The microwave process proved efficient, making it possible to use a lower temperature, less time, and less energy for modification and obtain starches with improved characteristics.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce various metabolites (i.e. metabiotics) with inhibitory capacity towards harmful foodborne pathogens. METHODS: This study aimed to design several antimicrobial formulations based on metabiotics obtained from different native LAB species (Lactobacillus pentosus UTNGt5, Lactococcus lactis UTNGt28, and Weissella cibaria UTNGt21O) and to detect the possible mode of action towards two multidrug resistant Staphylococcus spp. strains isolated from avocado (Persea nubigena var. guatemalensis) fruits. Additionally, the formulation with the highest inhibitory activity was tested ex vitro on avocados at the immature (firm) ripeness stage to evaluate their effect on microorganisms' growth and fruit quality attributes post-harvest. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Out of the top five formulations showing the highest bactericidal effect in vitro at their minimum inhibitory concentration (1 x MIC) on both Staphylococcus spp. targets one candidate annotated P11 (consisting of UTNGt21O and UTNGt28; 1:3, v/v) was selected. Co-cultivation of Staphylococcus strains with P11 formulation results in cell viability reduction by 98%, by impairing the integrity of the cell membrane inducing cytoplasm molecule content leakage, protein profile changes, and finally bacterial death. Even though the total coliforms, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., molds, and yeasts counts were not fully eliminated by day 13 of storage, a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.05) in viable cell counts were observed by day 8 upon the P11 treatment compared with non-treated control (C) and treated with a commercial disinfectant (T1) samples, suggesting that P11 formulation inhibited microbial colonization during storage. Likewise, no visible dark spots were observed on the mesocarp (pulp) upon the treatment with P11, whereas T1 and C fruits showed greater dark spots on the pulp as indicative of damage. The quality attributes, such as pH, total soluble solids, total titratable acidity, antioxidant capacity, and total polyphenol content, were not affected by the treatment. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) conducted on these five variables showed a clear separation of samples according to the maturity stage regardless of the treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the active metabolites from LAB strains might create a barrier between the exocarp and mesocarp, inhibiting the microorganisms colonization, reducing fruit damage, and lengthening the fruit quality and safety after harvest."

Phytochemicals in plant-based extracts could be useful to treat colorectal cancer, and/or reduce chemoresistance. Methanolic extract of avocado mesocarp (MEAM) has demonstrated antitumoral properties, depending on the fruit ripening stage (RS). The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of methanolic extracts of \"Hass\" avocado fruit at different RS on cytotoxicity, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-invasive, cell cycle, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition inhibition in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT29. The MEAM showed an increasing concentration of total phenolic compounds as the RS progressed, which was correlated with antioxidant capacity measured by the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power assay but not with the 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay. The specific phenolic compounds of MEAM were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and it was found that concentrations of epicatechin decreased while concentrations of chlorogenic acid increased as the RS progressed. The HT29 cell line was treated with MEAM for 48 h, and all MEAM had a cytotoxic effect, reported by MTT assay, nevertheless, the strongest effect was associated with the presence of chlorogenic acid. MEAM induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in phase G0/G1, reported by flow cytometry. Moreover, MEAM inhibited cell migration evidenced by the wound healing assay. On the other hand, MEAM significantly reduced expression of mRNA of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and cyclooxygenase 2. These effects comprise important inhibition of some hallmarks of cancer. This, in turn, may provide interesting guidelines for developing antitumoral intervention agents.",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine changes in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 after a food-based intervention, and assess the associations between HEI-2015 change and intervention effects on cardiometabolic risk-related outcomes. METHODS: The Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial was a 26-wk, multicenter, randomized, controlled parallel-arm study. Participants were 1008 individuals aged ≥25 y with abdominal obesity (females ≥ 35 inches; males ≥ 40 inches). The avocado-supplemented diet group was provided 1 avocado per day, and the habitual diet group maintained their usual diet. Change in diet quality was assessed using the HEI-2015 from a single 24-h recall conducted at 4 time points. Mixed models were used for analysis. RESULTS: The avocado-supplemented diet group had a greater increase in the HEI-2015 (4.74 points; 95% CI: 2.93, 6.55) at 26 wk than the habitual diet group. Compared with the habitual diet group, the avocado-supplemented diet group had greater increases in the following HEI-2015 components from baseline: total vegetables (0.99 points; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.21), fatty acid ratio (2.25 points; 95% CI: 1.74, 2.77), sodium (1.03 points; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.55), refined grains (0.82 points; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.31), and added sugars (0.84 points; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.19). No differences in HEI-2015 improvements were observed by race, ethnicity, study site, body mass index, or age category. In the avocado-supplemented diet compared with the habitual diet group, the HEI-2015 increased in females (6.50 points; 95% CI: 4.39, 8.62) but not in males (0.02 points; 95% CI: -3.44, 3.48). Median HEI-2015 change was not associated with intervention-related changes in cardiometabolic disease risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of 1 avocado per day for 26 wk in adults with abdominal obesity increased adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Changes in diet quality did not predict changes in risk factors for cardiometabolic disease.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03528031 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03528031)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plant water status is important for fruit development, because many fleshy fruits contain large amounts of water. However, there is no information on vascular flows of Persea americana 'Hass' avocado. The aims of this research were to explore the impact of drought stress on the water relationships of the 'Hass' avocado plant and its fruit growth. METHODS: Well-watered and water-stressed 'Hass' avocado plants were compared. Over 4 weeks, water flows through the shoot and fruit pedicel were monitored using external sap flow gauges. Fruit diameter was monitored using linear transducers, and stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthesis (A) and leaf and stem water potentials (Ѱleaf and Ѱstem) were measured to assess the response of the plants to water supply. KEY RESULTS: In well-watered conditions, the average water inflow to the shoot was 72 g day-1. Fruit water inflow was 2.72 g day-1, but there was water loss of 0.37 g day-1 caused by the outflow (loss back into the tree) through the vascular tissues and 1.06 g day-1 from the fruit skin. Overall, fruit volume increased by 1.4 cm3 day-1. In contrast, water flow into fruit of water-stressed plants decreased to 1.88 g day-1, with the outflow increasing to 0.61 g day-1. As a result, increases in fruit volume were reduced to 0.4 cm3 day-1. The values of A, gs and sap flow to shoots were also reduced during drought conditions. Changes in the hourly time-courses of pedicel sap flow, fruit volume and stem water potential during drought suggest that the stomatal response prevented larger increases in outflow from the fruit. Following re-watering, a substantial recovery in growth rate was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, a reduction in growth of avocado fruit was observed with induced water deficit, but the isohydric stomatal behaviour of the leaves helped to minimize negative changes in water balance. Also, there was substantial recovery after re-watering, hence the short-term water stress did not decrease avocado fruit size. Negative impacts might appear if the drought treatment were prolonged.",

One such problem is the low level of induction of white-opaque somatic embryos (WOSEs) during the process of obtaining full avocado plants. We detected the induction of multiple WOSEs promoted after the placement of three or four small WOSEs over the embryogenic callus of Duke-7. Among the other possible chemical inductors of the Arabinogalactans (AGPs), we identified a family of extracellular plant proteoglycans implicated in many aspects of the in vitro induction of somatic embryos (SE). We extracted AGPs directly from embryogenic cultures of avocado. When the induction/proliferation medium of embryogenic avocado calli (MS-0.1 mg L-1 Picloram) was supplemented with 1-2 mg L-1 AGP, the induction rate of good-quality WOSEs from the embryogenic callus increased significantly (more than ten times that of the control without AGP) and this effect persisted for at least five subcultures after the initial treatment with AGP. AGP also modified the texture and quality of the callus. The effect of AGP extends to other cultivars and proliferation media. Our objectives were to improve the induction of WOSEs and study the effect of AGP in the somatic embryogenesis of avocado."

There remains a paucity of trial data on the effect of specific nutritional interventions on physical activity and sedentary time. One question is how a common nutrient-dense food such as avocado may impact physical activity and sedentary time in Hispanic/Latino families, a group that reports the lowest levels of physical activity. DESIGN: This is a 6-month clustered RCT. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two families (235 individuals) who identified as Hispanic/Latino were enrolled through the San Ysidro Health Center (San Diego, CA) between April 2017 and June 2018. INTERVENTION: After a 2-week run-in period, 35 families were randomized to the intervention arm (14 avocados/family/week), and 37 families were assigned to the control arm (3 avocados/family/week). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess changes in physical activity (MET minutes per week) between the groups during the 6-month trial. Secondary outcomes included sedentary time (minutes/week), BMI, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. RESULTS: An adherence goal of >80% was achieved for both arms. Total mean physical activity increased by 2,197 MET minutes per week more in the intervention group (p<0.01) than in the control group, driven by between-group differences in moderate (p<0.01) versus vigorous (p=0.06) physical activity. After accounting for longitudinal repeated measures per participant and nested family effects, total adult physical activity remained significantly higher in the intervention than in the control group (+1,163 MET minutes per week on average per participant), with a significant intervention interaction term (p<0.01). There were no significant changes in sedentary time, BMI, or blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Higher allocation of avocados was associated with significantly higher physical activity and no adverse changes in BMI or blood pressure, suggesting that this nutritional intervention may have beneficial pleiotropic effects.Trial registration: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02903433."

Transcriptomic profiling revealed 5425 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 55 of which were involved in the pathways related to plant defense response to pathogens. Key genes were associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, mitogen-activated protein signaling, plant hormone signaling, calcium ion signal decoding, and pathogenesis-related proteins. Dysregulated genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis were also identified, and the reduction in ethylene production by HDPAF was corroborated by gas chromatography, where three days of delayed peak production was observed compared to that in water-treated fruits. These results help to understand the mechanism of induction of the avocado defense system by applying HDPAF and support the application of HDPAF as an efficient postharvest treatment to extend the shelf life of the fruit.",

We report the normalizing effects of an AP-derived phenolic extract (PE) on the plasma lipid profile of male Wistar rats. A standard (SD) and high-fat diet (HFD) were formulated, and the same diets were supplemented with 1 g/kg of diet of PE (SD + PE and HFD + PE). Rats were fed these diets during an 8-week period. The HFD induced signs of dyslipidemia, but PE treatment countered the decrease in HDL. Relative mRNA expression (real-time PCR) of the hepatic HDL receptor (SCARB1) increased in both groups (SD + PE and HFD + PE), while the LDR receptor (LDLR) increased in SD + PE group. The mRNA expression of apolipoproteins APOA1 and APOB was unaffected. We conclude that PCs from AP can counter a diet-induced decrease in plasma HDL by acting on the mRNA expression of its hepatic receptor.",

Although emerging studies suggest that avocado (Persea americana Mill) displays antineoplastic properties in addition to numerous other health benefits, current literature lacks an updated comprehensive systematic review dedicated to the anticancer effects of avocado. This review aims to explore the cancer-preventive effects of avocados and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The in vitro studies suggest the various avocado-derived products and phytochemicals induced cytotoxicity, reduced cell viability, and inhibited cell proliferation. The in vivo studies revealed reduction in tumor number, size, and volume as well. The clinical studies demonstrated that avocado leaf extract increased free oxygen radical formation in larynx carcinoma tissue. Various avocado products and phytochemicals from the avocado fruit, including avocatin-B, persin, and PaDef defensin, may serve as viable cancer prevention and treatment options based on current literature. Despite many favorable outcomes, past research has been limited in scope, and more extensive and mechanism-based in vivo and randomized clinical studies should be performed before avocado-derived bioactive phytochemicals can be developed as cancer preventive agents.",

      "abstract": "In May 2022, rot symptoms were observed 5 days after storage on fresh avocado fruits cv \"Lamb Hass\" harvested from a 3.4 ha organic orchard in Chania, Crete exhibiting 30% symptom incidence. Brownish-green sunken lesions and soft rot with dark brown lesions covering up to 50% of the mesocarp on fruits and blackish soft lesions on fruit stem ends were observed. To isolate the pathogens, fruits were surface sterilized using 1% NaOCl for 1 min, placed in 70% ethanol for 30 s and washed twice with sterile distilled water. Then, small pieces were excised from the fruit rot margins and transferred on PDA amended with 0.015% streptomycin-sulfate. Single-spore isolates were incubated on PDA for 10 days and subjected to morphological examination. Two distinct pathogenic fungal isolates were obtained, and their symptoms were re-examined on avocado fruits. The first isolate (A1) obtained from the fruit stem end, initially produced hyaline dense aerial mycelia, being gray and black on the upper and lower surface of the Petri dishes, respectively. The second isolate (A2) obtained from the main body of the fruit, formed round, grayish colonies, with orange conidial aggregates. Based on morphological characteristics (Phillips et al.,2013; Weir et al., 2012), isolates were preliminary identified as Neofusicoccum sp. (A1) and Colletotrichum sp. (A2). Isolates were molecularly identified by sequencing of the ITS-5.8S rRNA, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and beta-tubulin (tub2) genes. PCRs were conducted using primer pairs ITS4/ITS5, EF1-728F/EF1986R and Bt2a/Bt2b as well as ITS4/ITS5 and 5'-tef1/3'-tef1 and Bt2a/Bt2b for isolates A1 and A2, respectively (Carbone & Kohn, 1999; Glass & Donaldson, 1995; Rojas et al., 2010; Weir et al., 2012; White et al., 1990). The sequences were deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers OQ852465, OQ867962, OQ867965 for N. luteum and, OQ852466, OQ867963 and OQ867964 for C. gloeosporioides. Based on Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), a phylogenetic tree was constructed using concatenated sequences, following Kimura's two parameter model (1980), which confirmed their identity as N luteum and C. gloeosporioides strains. Mature avocado fruits (cv. Hass) were surface sterilized and dried. Consequently, incised fruits were inoculated with mycelial agar plugs (5 mm in diameter) cut from the edge of rapidly growing colonies of N. luteum and C. gloeosporioides strains. Fruits incubated in moist chambers and at 25°C for 5 days in the dark. Fruit bodies and stems were inoculated with the respective isolates and sterile agar plugs in the case of the control. Five fruits were used for each pathogenic trial per fungal isolate, which was repeated twice. After symptom occurrence, these pathogenic isolates were re-isolated successfully and molecularly identified, while exhibiting similar to original symptoms confirming Koch's postulates. While other reports exist on the presence of these pathogens in different countries worldwide, this is the first report of C. gloeosporioides and N. luteum as post-harvest pathogens of avocado, which is an economically important crop of Crete, in Greece (Akgül et al., 2016). This study provides the means for the accurate identification of these fungal pathogens causing avocado fruit rots and taking into consideration the available treatment options can contribute to establishing effective management strategies."

This study aimed to compare the effect of various predry-treatments on the yield and quality of avocado oil from three Chinese avocado (Persea americana Mill.) varieties (Hass, Reed, and Pinkerton). The results showed that drying methods had significant effect on the avocado oil yield and its composition. Among the three drying methods the highest yield was obtained by freeze drying, and Hass showed the highest yield in the three avocado varieties with its oil owning the lowest peroxide and anisidine value. Reed oil owned the highest levels of functional micronutrients (e.g., tocopherols, phenolics, squalene). Vacuum drying resulted in higher concentrations of tocopherols, phytosterols, phenolics, squalene, and thus rendered greater DPPH and ABTS scavenging activity. These results are important to improve the quality of Chinese avocado oil."

Unfortunately, they have been implicated in genotoxicity due to their ubiquity, toxicological properties, persistence and presence in the food chain. This study sought to evaluate the efficacy of powdered avocado seed on reproductive parameters in the management of oxidative stress in female rabbits caused by the herbicide Mancozeb. Twenty-eight female rabbits aged 7-8 months and weighing between 2780.4 g and 3143.7 g were randomly divided into four groups of seven rabbits each. Each group received for 90 consecutive days distilled water or Mancozeb associated or not with avocado seed powder orally as follows: T1: 10 ml distilled water; T2, T3 and T4: 100 mg/kg bw Mancozeb. This was followed by oral administration of 250, 500, and 0 mg/kg of avocado seed powder for T2, T3, and T4, respectively. Water and feed were distributed ad libitum. Collected data concerned growth, carcass and reproductive performances, hematological and biochemistry characteristics. Results demonstrated that pregnant and lactating female rabbits administered Mancozeb exhibited a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in food intake, body weight, and body weight gain. Female rabbits exposed to Mancozeb had a decrease in litter size and weight from birth to weaning, as well as in weaning body weight and weight increase, fertility and prolificacy rate, milk yield, and daily milk efficiency. However, administration of avocado seed powder reversed (P < 0.05) the trends in these parameters in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in relative weight of the kidney and liver, concentrations of urea, creatinine, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, mean cell volume, white blood cells, and lymphocytes were all associated with increased Mancozeb rates (P < 0.05). On the contrary, administration of the Mancozeb caused decrease in hemoglobin (Hb), Red blood Cell (RBC) and protein content. Administration of avocado seed powder significantly (P < 0.05) ameliorated the Mancozeb effects on these parameters. Applying 500 mg/kg b.w Avocado seed powder may be suggested as an alternative therapy for reproductive defects induced by Mancozeb in female rabbits."

Extraction with ethyl acetate allowed the recovery of the bioactive compounds while maintaining the polysaccharides in the liquor. The extract was rich in vanillin (99.02 mg/g AS) and contained several phenolic acids and flavonoids. The solid phase and the phenolic-free liquor were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis to produce glucose, reaching values of 9.93 and 105 g glucose/L, respectively.

The well-developed microporosity resulted in a good CO2 adsorption value of 5.9 mmol/g at a temperature of 0 °C and 1 bar and selectivity over nitrogen for flue gas simulation. The activated carbons were investigated using nitrogen sorption at -196 °C, CO2 sorption, X-ray diffraction, and SEM. It was found that the adsorption data were more in line with the Sips model. The isosteric heat of adsorption for the best sorbent was calculated. It was found that the isosteric heat of adsorption changed in the range of 25 to 40 kJ/mol depending on the surface coverage. The novelty of the work is the production of highly microporous activated carbons from avocado stones with high CO2 adsorption. Before now, the activation of avocado stones using NaOH had never been described."

Two different natural extracts were initially evaluated and characterized: one obtained from olive pomace (OE) and other from pomegranate seed waste. OE was selected due to its better antioxidant potential according to FRAP, ABTS, and DPPH assays as well as its higher total phenolic content. The formulations used were 0, 1.5 wt.%, and 3 wt.% of OE. A gradual disappearance of the band found around 3009 cm-1 and related to unsaturated fatty acids was observed in the control sample in contrast to formulations with added OE. The band observed near 3299 cm-1 widened and intensified with time due to the oxidation degree of samples, with this effect being higher in the control chips. The observed changes in fatty acid and hexanal content with storage time underlined the higher extent of oxidation in the control samples. This fact could suggest an antioxidant protectant action of OE in avocado chips during thermal treatment, which was attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds. The obtained chips incorporating OE represent a viable option for the development of a natural, healthy, and clean-label avocado snack at competitive cost and with low environmental impacts."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: While the association between avocado consumption and low metabolic risk has been shown in some studies conducted in adults, little is known about the potential effects of avocado consumption on health outcomes in children and adolescents. Thus, we investigated the impact of two levels of avocado allotment, plus a standard nutrition education, on measures of adiposity in children and adolescents (<18 years old). METHODS: Children (aged 5-12, n = 58) and adolescents (aged 13-17, n = 32) in seventy-two families that self-identified as Hispanic, with at least 3 members over the age of 5 that resided in the same home, were free of severe chronic disease, and not on specific diets, were randomized to one of two levels of avocado allotment plus bi-weekly nutrition education sessions. Low allotment families received 3 avocados per week, while high allotment families received 14 avocados per week for 6 months. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, using unpaired, 2-sided t-tests to test the mean changes in anthropometric measures of adiposity (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, and weight) between children and adolescents from high and low allotment families after the 6-month intervention. RESULTS: At six months, there were no significant differences in body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, or waist circumference to weight ratio by avocado allotment group. In children, there was a significant difference in weight (difference in means: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.09, 2.10, p-value = 0.03) and waist circumference to height ratio (difference in means: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.41, p-value <0.01) between the avocado allotment groups at six months, but these did not remain significant after sensitivity analyses including per-protocol analyses. In adolescents only, there was a significant reduction in waist to hip circumference ratio in the high allotment group compared to the low allotment group after 6 months (difference in means: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.08, 0.00, p-value = 0.04) that persisted after multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Different levels of avocado availability among children and adolescents does not appear to result in significant changes in anthropometric measures. Further study is needed to determine whether avocado consumption promotes metabolic health in this age group.",

This prospective multicenter observational study enrolled 149 consecutive patients undergoing VIABAHN® VBX-CS (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) implantation for complex AIOD (age, 74 ± 9 years; male, 74%; diabetes mellitus, 46%; renal failure on dialysis, 23%; chronic limb-threatening ischemia, 26%). The primary study endpoint was 1-year primary patency, and the secondary endpoints were procedural complications, freedom from occlusion, clinical-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), and surgical revision at 1 year. Risk factors for restenosis were explored using random survival forest analysis. The median follow-up period was 13.1 months (interquartile range 9.7-14.0 months). Procedural complications were observed in 6.7% of the patients. The 1-year primary patency was 94.8% (95% confidence interval 91.0-98.6%), while the 1-year freedom rate from occlusion, CD-TLR, and surgical revision rates were 96.5% (93.5-99.5%), 94.7% (90.9-98.6%), and 97.8% (95.4-100%), respectively. The presence of chronic total occlusion, aortic bifurcation lesion, the number of disease regions, and TASC-II classification was significantly associated with the restenosis risk. In contrast, the calcification severity, IVUS use, IVUS parameters were not associated with restenosis risk.

      "abstract": "Unsuccessful anesthesia often occurs under an inflammatory tissue environment, making dentistry treatment extremely painful and challenging. Articaine (ATC) is a local anesthetic used at high (4%) concentrations. Since nanopharmaceutical formulations may improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, we encapsulated ATC in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) aiming to increase the anesthetic effect on the inflamed tissue. Moreover, the lipid nanoparticles were prepared with natural lipids (copaiba (Copaifera langsdorffii) oil and avocado (Persia gratissima) butter) that added functional activity to the nanosystem. NLC-CO-A particles (~217 nm) showed an amorphous lipid core structure according to DSC and XDR. In an inflammatory pain model induced by λ-carrageenan in rats, NLC-CO-A improved (30%) the anesthetic efficacy and prolonged anesthesia (3 h) in relation to free ATC. In a PGE2-induced pain model, the natural lipid formulation significantly reduced (~20%) the mechanical pain when compared to synthetic lipid NLC. Opioid receptors were involved in the detected analgesia effect since their blockage resulted in pain restoration. The pharmacokinetic evaluation of the inflamed tissue showed that NLC-CO-A decreased tissue ATC elimination rate (ke) by half and doubled ATC's half-life. These results present NLC-CO-A as an innovative system to break the impasse of anesthesia failure in inflamed tissue by preventing ATC accelerated systemic removal by the inflammatory process and improving anesthesia by its association with copaiba oil."

      "abstract": "The aim of this greenhouse study was to evaluate root irrigation, foliar spray, and stem injection in order to find the best method for the nanofertilization of avocado plants with green synthesized CuNPs. One-year-old avocado plants were supplied four times (every 15 days) with 0.25 and 0.50 mg/ml of CuNPs through the three fertilization methods. Stem growth and new leaf formation were evaluated over time and after 60 days of CuNPs exposure, several plant traits (root growth, fresh and dry biomass, plant water content, cytotoxicity, photosynthetic pigments, and total Cu accumulation in plant tissues) were evaluated for CuNPs improvement. Regarding the control treatment, stem growth and new leaf appearance were increased by 25 % and 85 %, respectively, by the CuNPs supply methods of foliar spray>stem injection>root irrigation, with little significant differences among NPs concentrations. Avocado plants supplied with 0.25 and 0.50 mg/ml CuNPs maintained a hydric balance and cell viability ranged from 91 to 96 % through the three NPs application methods. TEM did not reveal any ultrastructural organelle changes induced by CuNPs in leaf tissues. The concentrations of CuNPs tested were not high enough to exert deleterious effects on the photosynthetic machinery of avocado plants, but photosynthetic efficiency was also found to be improved. The foliar spray method showed improved uptake and translocation of CuNPs, with almost no loss of Cu. In general, the improvement in plant traits indicated that the foliar spray method was the best for nanofertilization of avocado plants with CuNPs.",

      "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites, especially Eimeria sp., are the main intestinal murine pathogens, that lead to severe injuries to farm and domestic animals. Many anticoccidial drugs are available for coccidiosis, which, leads to the development of drug-resistant parasites. Recently, natural products are considered as an alternative agent to control coccidiosis. This study was designed to evaluate the anticoccidial activity of the Persea americana fruit extract (PAFE) in male C57BL/6 mice. A total of 35 male mice were divided into seven equal groups (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). At day 0, all groups except the first group which served as uninfected-untreated control were infected orally with 1 × 103E. papillata sporulated oocysts. Group 2 served as uninfected-treated control. Group 3 was considered an infected-untreated group. After 60 min of infection, groups 4, 5, and 6 were treated with oral doses of PAFE aqueous methanolic extract (100, 300, and 500 mg/kg of body weight, respectively). Group 7 was treated with amprolium (a reference drug for coccidiosis). PAFE with 500 mg/kg, was the most effective dose, inducing a significant reduction in the output of oocysts in mice feces (by about 85.41%), accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of the developmental parasite stages and a significant elevation of the goblet cells in the jejunal tissues. Upon treatment, a significant change in the oxidative status due to E. papillata infection was observed, where the levels of glutathione (GSH) increased, while, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were decreased. In addition, the infection significantly upregulated the inflammatory cytokines of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). This increase in mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ was about 8.3, 10.6, and 4.5-fold, respectively, which significantly downregulated upon treatment. Collectively, P. americana is a promising medicinal plant with anticoccidial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities and could be used for the treatment of coccidiosis.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer progresses without obvious symptoms and is detected in most patients at late stages, causing a high rate of mortality. Avocado peels (AVP) were thought to be biowaste, but they have antioxidant and anticancer properties in vitro. Chitosan nanoparticles (Cs-NPs) were loaded with various plant extracts, increasing their in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities. Our goal was to load AVP onto Cs-NPs and determine the role of AVP-extract or AVP-loaded Cs-NPs in controlling the progression of lung cancer caused by urethane toxicity. The AVP-loaded chitosan nano-combination (Cs@AVP NC) was synthesized and characterized. Our in vitro results show that Cs@AVP NC has higher anticancer activity than AVP against three human cancer cell lines. The in vivo study proved the activation of apoptosis in lung cancer cells with the Cs@AVP NC oral treatment more than the AVP treatment. Additionally, Cs@AVP NC-treated animals showed significantly higher p53 and Bax-expression levels and lower NF-κB p65 levels in their lung tissues than in positive control animals. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the superior anticancer potency of Cs@AVP NC over AVP extract and its ability to inhibit lung cancer proliferation. Therefore, oral consumption of Cs@AVP NC might be a promising treatment for lung cancer.",

Currently, there are no studies evaluating the effect of a diet based on fruit, avocado, whole grains, and trout (FAWGT diet) on the expression of obesity-related genes. This randomized controlled crossover study included 44 obese Colombians with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 who followed either a FAWGT diet or a usual diet (UD) characterized by a high intake of saturated fat and foods rich in processed carbohydrates. After 8 weeks of intervention, a postprandial expression study of inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes was carried out with a real-time PCR. The intervention with a FAWGT diet decreased the expression of inflammatory (NFKB1, IL6, IL1β) and oxidative stress (NFE2L2) genes compared with the intake of the UD. Finally, the postprandial expression of NFkB1 was positively correlated with triglyceride levels after a dietary intervention with the FAWGT diet and the IL1β gene, and likewise with insulin levels after following the usual diet. The consumption of the FAWGT diet for 8 weeks reduced the inflammatory status; thus, it can be considered a valid alternative to other healthy diets, since it induces beneficial changes on the genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress in obese people.",

      "abstract": "Nutritional interventions have been shown to be an interesting approach for the treatment of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Persea americana Mill. (avocado), is a potential food to be used for the prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation, due to its nutritional value and pharmacological effects. In this study we evaluated if the dietary intervention with avocado fruit pulp could as an intestinal anti-inflammatory diet using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of intestinal inflammation in rats. For this purpose, 5, 10 or 20% of avocado fruit pulp was incorporated in the diet of rats, for 21 days before and 7 days after TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation. Dietary intervention with avocado fruit pulp (20%) decreased the extension of colonic lesions (1.38 ± 0.99 vs. 2.67 ± 0.76 cm), weight/length colon ratio (151.03 ± 31.45 vs. 197.39 ± 49.48 cm), inhibited myeloperoxidase activity (891.2 ± 243.2 vs 1603 ± 158.2 U/g), reduced tumor necrosis factor-α (53.94 ± 6.45 vs. 114.9 ± 6.21 pg/mg), interleukin-1β (583.6 ± 106.2 vs. 1259 ± 81.68 pg/mg) and interferon gamma (27.95 ± 2.97 vs. 47.79 ± 3.51 pg/mg) levels and prevented colonic glutathione depletion (2585 ± 77.2 vs 1778 ± 167.2 nmol/g). The consumption of enriched diet with 20% avocado pulp by 28 days did not promote any alterations in the biochemical or behavioral parameters evaluated. Avocado showed intestinal anti-inflammatory activity, modulating immune response, and acting as antioxidant. The dietary intervention with avocado was safe, suggesting its potential as a complementary treatment in intestinal inflammation.",

A low-intensity cavitation process with air being injected into water was studied to determine the microbubbles' efficiency when detaching L. monocytogenes from stainless steel and the surface of fresh cucumber and avocado. Stainless steel coupons (1″ × 2″), cucumber, and avocado surfaces were inoculated with L. monocytogenes (LCDC strain). After 1, 24 or 48 h, loosely attached cells were washed off, and inoculated areas were targeted by microbubbles (~0.1-0.5 mm dia.) through a bubble diffuser (1.0 L air/min) for 1, 2, 5, or 10 min. For steel, L. monocytogenes (48 h drying) detachment peaked at 2.95 mean log reduction after 10 min of microbubbles when compared to a no-bubble treatment. After 48 h pathogen drying, cucumbers treated for 10 min showed a 1.78 mean log reduction of L. monocytogenes. For avocados, L. monocytogenes (24 h drying) detachment peaked at 1.65 log reduction after 10 min of microbubbles. Microbubble applications may be an effective, economical, and environmentally friendly way to remove L. monocytogenes, and possibly other bacterial pathogens, from food contact surfaces and the surfaces of whole, intact fresh produce."

During the two-year study, we investigated a horse farm with six horses that often fed themselves with P. americana leaves or mature fruit pulp and skin on the ground. Two horses died, and one underwent necropsy, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry using the anti-cardiac troponin C (cTnC). Grossly and histopathologically, there was severe cardiac fibroplasia. Immunohistochemically, there was a multifocal decrease or negative expression in the cTnC cardiomyocytes' cytoplasm. Persea americana leaves were confirmed in the alimentary tract using botanical anatomy and molecular techniques. The chemical investigation by (LC-ESI-MS) revealed the presence of the acetogenins, persin and avocadene 1-acetate from P. americana. Persin was present in leaves and fruits (seed and pulp), while avocadene 1-acetate was found in leaves and fruits (seed, peel, and pulp) with a higher concentration in the pulp. Four other horses have been examined by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and serum Troponin 1 (cTnI). To establish a causal effect of consumption of P.

Avocado is a common food in the human diet that contains antioxidant and antitumor properties. In male rats, avocado oil's protection against lufenuron-induced reproductive deterioration, oxidative stress, and DNA damages was investigated. Twenty-eight mature male rats were selected and distributed into four groups: Group 1, control group were administered distilled water orally; Group 2 received 4 ml/kg avocado; Group 3 was given lufenuron (1.6 mg/kg), and Group 4 was given avocado oil/lufenuron. The findings show that lufenuron treatment reduces reproductive hormone levels, sperm count, motility, viability and causes negative histopathological changes in testicular tissue, such as decreased epithelial height and increased luminal diameter degenerated spermatogenesis. Furthermore, lufenuron reduced the content of antioxidant enzymes while increasing the level of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and corresponding DNA damage. Results showed that lufenuron is associated with testicular function impairment, which leads to infertility. Treatment with avocado oil improved reproductive hormone secretions, enzymatic activity, histological and DNA damage parameters in testis tissues, reducing the negative effects of lufenuron, proving that it may have a therapeutic role against lufenuron-mediated testicular toxicity.",

HDPAF retrieves the deceleration of both firmness loss and physiological weight loss compared to the control. Regarding quality parameters such as color, pH, total soluble solids, and titratable acidity, no significant differences were observed between treatments compared to the control; therefore, these parameters were not negatively affected by HDPAF treatments, but a positive effect on the induction of the defense system is shown."

      "abstract": "Avocado is a fruit rich in dietary fibre, potassium, Mg, mono and PUFA and bioactive phytochemicals, which are nutritional components that have been associated with cardiovascular health. Yet, despite the boom in avocado consumption, we lack evidence on its association with CVD risk in the general population. To estimate the prospective association between avocado consumption and incident hypertension in Mexican women, we estimated the association in participants from the Mexican Teachers' Cohort who were ≥ 25 years, free of hypertension, CVD and cancer at baseline (n 67 383). We assessed baseline avocado consumption with a semi-quantitative FFQ (never to six or more times per week). Incident hypertension cases were identified if participants self-reported a diagnosis and receiving treatment. To assess the relation between categories of avocado consumption (lowest as reference) and incident hypertension, we estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95 % CI using Poisson regression models and adjusting for confounding. We identified 4002 incident cases of hypertension during a total of 158 706 person-years for a median follow-up of 2·2 years. The incidence rate of hypertension was 25·1 cases per 1000 person-years. Median avocado consumption was 1·0 (interquartile range: 0·23, 1·0) serving per week (half an avocado). After adjustment for confounding, consuming 5 + servings per week of avocado was associated with a 17 % decrease in the rate of hypertension, compared with non- or low consumers (IRR = 0·83; 95 % CI: 0·70, 0·99; Ptrend = 0·01). Frequent consumption of avocado was associated with a lower incidence of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Using synthetic pesticides to manage pests can threaten pollination services, affecting the productivity of pollination-dependent crops such as avocado. The need to mitigate this negative externality has led to the emergence of the concept of integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM) to achieve both pest and pollinator management, leading to complementary or synergistic benefits for yield and quality of the harvest. This paper aims to evaluate the potential economic and welfare impact of IPPM in avocado production systems in Kenya and Tanzania. We utilize both primary and secondary data and employed the economic surplus model. On average the potential economic gain from the adoption of IPPM is US$ 66 million annually in Kenya, with a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 13:1, while in Tanzania US$ 1.4 million per year, with a BCR of 34:1. The potential benefits from IPPM intervention gains are expected to reduce the number of poor people in Kenya and Tanzania by 10,464 and 1,255 people per year respectively. The findings conclude that policies that enhance the adoption of IPPM can fast-track economic development and therefore improve the livelihoods of various actors across the avocado value chain.",

      "abstract": "Background Excess visceral adiposity is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders. Short-term well-controlled clinical trials suggest that regular avocado consumption favorably affects body weight, visceral adiposity, and satiety. Methods and Results The HAT Trial (Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial) was a multicenter, randomized, controlled parallel-arm trial designed to test whether consuming 1 large avocado per day for 6 months in a diverse group of free-living individuals (N=1008) with an elevated waist circumference compared with a habitual diet would decrease visceral adiposity as measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary and additional end points related to risk factors associated with cardiometabolic disorders were assessed. The primary outcome, change in visceral adipose tissue volume during the intervention period, was not significantly different between the Avocado Supplemented and Habitual Diet Groups (estimated mean difference (0.017 L [-0.024 L, 0.058 L], P=0.405). No significant group differences were observed for the secondary outcomes of hepatic fat fraction, hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), and components of the metabolic syndrome. Of the additional outcome measures, modest but nominally significant reductions in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in the Avocado Supplemented compared with the Habitual Diet Group. Changes in the other additional and post hoc measures (body weight, body mass index, insulin, very low-density lipoprotein concentrations, and total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio) were similar between the 2 groups. Conclusions Addition of 1 avocado per day to the habitual diet for 6 months in free-living individuals with elevated waist circumference did not reduce visceral adipose tissue volume and had minimal effect on risk factors associated with cardiometabolic disorders.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The changes in surface or stem-end (SE) fungal microbiomes at the postharvest stage of avocado fruit were studied using next-generation sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Avocado fructoplane and SE pulp fungal richness differed significantly between postharvest stages with a decline following prochloraz dip treatments. Known postharvest decay-causing genera, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Alternaria, Epicoccum, Penicillium and Neofusicoccum were detected, with Papiliotrema, Meyerozyma and Aureobasidium confirmed as the most dominant potentially beneficial genera. Postharvest interventions such as prochloraz had a negative non-target effect on the presence of Papiliotrema flavescens on the avocado fructoplane. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a core community of beneficial and pathogenic taxa in the avocado fructoplane and further highlight the reduction of pathogenic fungi as a consequence of fungicide use. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The current study provides important baseline data for further exploration of fungal population shifts in avocado fruit driven by chemical (fungicide) as well as physical (cold storage) interventions.",

METHODS: Aqueous extracts of Allium sativum, Persia. americana and three formulations were mixed at various portions (A. s/P. a; w/w): F (1:1), F (3: 1), and F(1:3). They were then tested for their antioxidant potentials in vitro using FRAP, DPPH and NO radicals to identify the best formulation. Four hundred (400) mg/kg b.w. of formulation F(1:1) were administered once daily for 21 days to rats previously fed with HFHSD for 8 weeks. Standard diet, vitamin E, and Atorvastatin were used as controls. After 21 days, body weight, blood glucose, lipid markers, activities of transaminases and markers of the antioxidant systems were assessed. RESULTS: The Formulation F(1:1) showed the best in vitro activity with IC50 values of 6.5 and 2.23 mg/mL respectively for FRAP and DPPH- radical scavenging capacity. HFHSD caused a depletion of antioxidants associated with an increase of pro-oxidants and all the lipid markers except HDL-c Treatment with F(1:1) significantly increased TAC, SOD, and catalase activities, while MDA, protein carbonyls, and NO levels decreased (p < 0.05). Formulation F(1:1) decreased triglycerides (119.88 ± 4.25 mg/dL) and LDL-c (3.78 ± 0.66 mg/dL) levels and significantly increased the HDL-c level: (108.07 ± 6.29 mg/mL). Furthermore, Formulation F(1:1) significantly caused weight loss (2.31%), reduced blood glucose levels (27.38%) and ALT activity. CONCLUSION: The formulation F(1:1) could be a good candidate for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress, dyslipidemia and features of metabolic syndrome."

OBJECTIVES: Assess replacement of carbohydrate energy with avocado energy for 12 wk on glucose homeostasis and cardiometabolic risk factors in self-selecting free-living adults who are overweight or with obesity and have insulin resistance. METHODS: In a single-center, randomized, 2-arm, controlled, 12-wk parallel trial, adults [n = 93; male/female: 39/54; mean ± SD age: 42 ± 12 y; BMI: 32.6 ± 3.9 (in kg/m2);  HOMA-IR: 2.7 ± 1.7] were counseled to exchange avocado (AV) or control food (C; low fat, low fiber, energy matched) for carbohydrate food in their usual diet for 12 wk. The primary outcome was the change in Matsuda Insulin Sensitivity Index (MISI) after 12-wk interventions. Secondary outcomes were changes in fasting and post-oral glucose tolerance test glycemic variables, fasting lipids, endothelial activation and inflammation markers. Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool captured weekly dietary intake. Intervention effects were mainly determined by ANCOVA using PC-SAS version 9.4. RESULTS: Dietary total, MUFA, and PUFA fat; fiber; and vegetable intake were higher in the AV group compared with the C group (P < 0.05), and no change in body weight or composition was observed (P > 0.05). Differences between the changes in MISI after AV compared with C were not different (Δ0-12 wk, P = 0.1092). Differences in fasting insulin (Δ0-12 wk, P = 0.0855) and improved glycated hemoglobin (Δ0-12 wk, P = 0.0632) after AV compared with C were suggested. C-reactive protein was significantly lower after AV compared with C at 12 wk (P = 0.0418). Select biomarkers of endothelial activation and lipoproteins by NMR were also influenced by AV compared with C food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Avocado intake was associated with a healthier dietary pattern and trends favoring improved glucose control and reduced biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk when replacing avocado energy for carbohydrate energy in free-living adults who are overweight or with obesity and have insulin resistance.

Soil treatments were organic mulches or silica-based mineral mulch. Reduction of root growth and visible root damage was least in the infested plants treated with phosphite or mineral mulch applied to the soil. Rhizosphere soils and root endospheres were analyzed for bacterial communities using metabarcoding. Bacterial abundance and diversity were reduced in infested rhizospheres and root endospheres. The presence or absence of mineral mulch resulted in greater diversity and larger differences in rhizosphere community composition between infested and non-infested pots than any other treatment. Some rhizosphere bacterial groups, especially Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, had significantly higher relative abundance in the presence of Phytophthora. The bacterial communities of root endospheres were lower in abundance than rhizosphere communities and not affected by soil treatments or phosphite but increased in abundance after infection with P. cinnamomi. These findings suggested that the addition of silicate-based mineral mulch protects against Phytophthora root rot, which may be partly mediated through changes in rhizosphere bacterial community composition. However, the changes to the microbiome induced by spraying plants with phosphite are different from those resulting from the application of mineral mulch to the soil."

Therefore, we aimed to test our hypothesis that the intake of avocado pulp may be a good strategy for improving anthropometric parameters and, consequently, metabolic health. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for studies published between database inception and July 2021. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing avocado intake on anthropometric parameters (primary outcome) and metabolic parameters (secondary outcomes) were included. Evidence from RCTs were synthesized as differences between standardized mean differences (SMDs) for change in body weight and body composition, comparing the experimental avocado group with control via random-effects meta-analyses. The risk of bias followed the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual. From 781 records identified, 8 studies with 657 individuals were included. No significant changes in body weight, body mass index, percent of body fat, or visceral adipose tissue in response to intervention was seen in the avocado group compared with the control group. Also, the pooled results showed no reduction in body weight and composition (SMD = 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.25; P= .25; I2 = 0%) of avocado in comparison to control. Secondary outcomes showed some potential benefits in metabolic parameters, mainly related to lipid profile. Regardless, consumption of avocado did not promote weight gain, and further studies are needed to elucidate this effect. The PROSPERO register number of this study is CRD42021266488.",

Applications of fludioxonil, thiophanate-methyl + etridiazole, prochloraz, and prochloraz MnCl at 2 and 4 weeks after inoculation with C. ilicicola significantly reduced root necrosis and improved root and aboveground plant biomass compared with water-treated controls. Fludioxonil reduced necrosis by 60% and had a significantly lower frequency of reisolation of C. ilicicola than the other three fungicide treatments. D. macrodidyma inoculation caused less severe symptoms in seedlings than C. ilicicola despite the longer duration of the trial. Pot drenches with fludioxonil, thiophanate-methyl + etridiazole, and prochloraz MnCl, but not prochloraz alone, significantly reduced root necrosis caused by D. macrodidyma. Prochloraz MnCl was the only fungicide treatment to increase root and plant biomass compared with water-treated controls. Both fludioxonil and prochloraz MnCl reduced the frequency of reisolation of D. macrodidyma from necrotic roots by about 50% compared with the other fungicides or water controls. The results indicated that drenches with these fungicides may suppress existing low to moderate black root rot infection, allowing new root growth and improved establishment in the orchard. Fungicide drenching must not replace best-practice disease management strategies in nurseries but may be a useful tool in crisis situations.",

Currently, the most effective way to treat diabetes is to mitigate postprandial hyperglycemia by inhibiting carbohydrate hydrolysis enzymes in the digestive system. Plant extracts are rich in bioactive compounds, which can be used in diabetes treatment. This study aims to evaluate the polyphenols content in ethanolic extracts of avocado fruit and leaves (Persea americana Mill.). Additionally, their antioxidant activity using DPPH, while the inhibition ability of α-amylase was examined by reacting different amounts of the extracts with α-amylase compared to acarbose as standard inhibitor. The active compounds were detected in the extracts by LC/MS. The obtained results showed that the leaf extract recorded a significant content of total phenolic compounds compared to the fruit extract (178.95 and 145.7 mg GAE /g dry weight, respectively). The total flavonoid values ​​ranged from 32.5 to 70.08 mg QE/g dry weight of fruit and leaves extracts, respectively. Twenty-six phytogenic compounds were detected in leaf and fruit extract by LC/MS. These compounds belong to fatty acids, sterols, triterpenes, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. The antioxidant activity of the extracts is due to the exist of phytogenic compounds, i.e., polyphenols and flavonoids. The antioxidant activity increased in a concentration dependant manner. Avocado fruit extract (1000 µg/mL) scavenged 95% of DPPḢ while leaf extract rummaged 91.03% of free radicals compared with Vit C and BHT. Additionally, higher α-amylase inhibitory activity was observed in fruit extract than the leaf extract, where the fruit and leaf extract (1000 μg/ml) inhibited the enzyme by 92.13% and 88.95%, respectively. The obtained results showed that the ethanolic extracts of avocado could have a significant impact on human health due to their high content of polyphenols."

      "abstract": "The treatment of diabetes involves the use of herbal plants, attracting interest in their cost-effectiveness and efficacy. An aqueous extract of Persea americana seeds (AEPAS) was explored in this study as a possible therapeutic agent in rats with diabetes mellitus. The induction of diabetes in the rats was achieved by injecting 65 mg/kg body weight (BWt) of alloxan along with 5% glucose. This study was conducted using thirty-six (36) male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into 6 equal groups, (n = 6) and treated for 14 days. In vitro assays for total flavonoid, phenols, FRAP, DPPH, NO, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase, were performed. Biochemical indices fasting blood sugar (FBS), BWt, serum insulin, liver hexokinase, G6P, FBP, liver glycogen, IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-ĸB in the serum, were investigated as well as the mRNA expressions of PCNA, Bcl2, PI3K/Akt in the liver and pancreas. The in vitro analyses showed the potency of AEPAS against free radicals and its enzyme inhibitory potential as compared with the positive controls. AEPAS showed a marked decrease in alloxan-induced increases in FBG, TG, LDL-c, G6P, F-1, 6-BP, MDA, IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-ĸB and increased alloxan-induced decreases in liver glycogen, hexokinase, and HDL-c. The diabetic control group exhibited pancreatic dysfunction as evidenced by a reduction in serum insulin, HOMA-β, expressions of PI3K/AKT, Bcl-2, and PCNA combined with an elevation in HOMA-IR. The HPLC revealed luteolin and myricetin to be the phytochemicals that were present in the highest concentration in AEPAS. The outcome of this research showed that the administration of AEPAS can promote the activation of the PI3K/AkT pathway and the inhibition of β-cell death, which may be the primary mechanism by which AEPAS promotes insulin sensitivity and regulates glycolipid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Avocado/soybean unsaponifiables (ASUs) are commonly used to treat OA symptoms. However, there are many ASU mixtures on the market with differing compositions and pharmacological activities. This study aimed to compare the composition and pharmacological activity of seven commercially available ASU products on human osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Methods: The contents of the lipidic part of ASUs were characterized by gas chromatography analysis using a VARIAN 3400 chromatograph. The pharmacological activity of the ASU products was tested on human osteoarthritis chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads. Their effects were evaluated on aggrecan, interleukin (IL)-6 and -8, and matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-3 using immunoassays and on nitric oxide through measurement of nitrite via spectrometry. Results: PIASCLEDINE-ExpASU® showed a specific profile with the presence of chromatographic peaks corresponding to an alkyl furan fraction and alkyl triols. PIASCLEDINE-ExpASU®, Persemax, Insaponifiable 300, Arthrocen, and Arthocare contained quantifiable amounts of tocopherol, while tocopherol was undetectable in Avovida and Saponic. Squalene was found only in PIASCLEDINE-ExpASU®. The abundance of sterols varied depending on the product. PIASCLEDINE-ExpASU® was the most active of the tested ASU products in inhibiting nitric oxide, IL-6, and IL-8 production by chondrocytes. With the exception of Saponic and Persemax, all the ASU mixtures either slightly or significantly increased aggrecan production. MMP-3 levels were significantly decreased by Insaponifiable 300 and PIASCLEDINE-ExpASU® and significantly increased by Saponic. Conclusion: The composition of PIASCLEDINE-ExpASU® is different to that of the other evaluated ASU mixtures. This specific composition explains its better pharmacological activity, including the higher inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory and pro-catabolic factors. Our findings are helpful in providing a basis for understanding the symptomatic effect of PIASCLEDINE-ExpASU® in patients with osteoarthritis."

      "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to optimize a new composite for the depollution of contaminated water. The sodium hydroxide-modified avocado shells (NaOH-AS) were firstly prepared, characterized by field-emission-scanning-electron-microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transforms infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and applied for efficient removal of crystal violet dye (CV) in wastewater. In addition, the adsorption in a batch system of CV dye on the NaOH-AS material was studied. Therefore, we accomplished a parametric study of the adsorption by studying the effect of several important parameters on the decolorizing power of the used material, namely, initial pH, contact time, initial CV dye concentration, temperature, and the ionic strength effect on the CV dye adsorption process were systematically assessed. The highest adsorption efficiency of CV dye (>96.9%) by NaOH-AS was obtained at pH >8. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model gave the best description of the adsorption kinetic of CV dye on the AS and NaOH-AS adsorbents. In addition, the mass transfer of CV dye molecules from the solution to the adsorbent surface occurred in three sequential stages (boundary layer diffusion, intraparticle diffusion and adsorption equilibrium). The adsorption isotherm data were best fitted with the Freundlich model. The adsorption capacity of AS increased from 135.88 to 179.80 mg g-1 after treatment by 1 M NaOH. The thermodynamic study showed that CV dye adsorption onto NaOH-AS was an exothermic and feasible process. The electrostatic interactions acted as the only forces governing the CV adsorption mechanism. The NaOH-AS demonstrated a satisfactory reusability. Therefore, we can state that the as-developed NaOH-AS material has a potential application prospect as an efficient adsorbent for CV dye from wastewaters.",

Compared to the CON diet, mice on the HF diet exhibited higher body weights; body fat; blood lipids; and leptin with reduced adiponectin levels, insulin sensitivity, VO2max, and falls from a rotarod. Mice on the HF + MH diet were completely protected against these changes in the absence of significant diet effects on food intake. Compared to the CON diet, oxidative stress was also increased by the HF diet indicated by higher levels of total reactive oxygen species, superoxide, and peroxynitrite measured in liver samples by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, whereas the HF + MH diet attenuated these changes. Compared to the CON, the HF diet increased signaling in the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and the addition of the MH-enriched AvX to this diet attenuated these changes. Beyond generating further interest in the health benefits of avocados, these results draw further new attention to the effects of this rare sugar, MH, as a botanical intervention for preventing obesity.",

The almond shell antioxidant extract (ASE) was obtained by microwave-assisted extraction, while cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were extracted from AS by a sequential process of alkalization, acetylation and acid hydrolysis. Four formulations were obtained by adding 0 (control), 6 wt.% of ASE (FG/ASE), 4.5 wt.% of CNCs (FG/CNC) and 6 wt.% + 4.5 wt.% of ASE + CNCs, respectively, (FG/ASE + CNC) into fish gelatin (FG). PLA/FG/PLA multilayer films were prepared by stacking two outer PLA layers into a middle FG film. A surface modification of PLA by air atmospheric plasma treatment was optimized before multilayer development to improve PLA adhesion. Complete characterization of the multilayers underlined the FG/ASE + CNC formulation as a promising active reinforced packaging system for food preservation, with low values of transparency, lightness and whiteness index. A good adhesion and homogeneity of the multilayer system was obtained by SEM, and they also demonstrated low oxygen permeability (40.87 ± 5.20 cm3 mm m-2 day) and solubility (39.19 ± 0.16%) values, while mechanical properties were comparable with commercial plastic films. The developed multilayer films were applied to Hass avocado preservation. The initial degradation temperature (Tini), DSC parameters and in vitro antioxidant capacity of the films were in accordance with the low peroxide and anisidine values obtained from avocado pulp after packaging for 14 days at 4 °C. The developed PLA/FG/PLA films supplemented with 6 wt.% ASE+ 4.5 wt.% CNCs may be potential bioactive packaging systems for fat food preservation."

As with other root diseases, an integrated approach is required to control WRR. No fully effective control methods are available, and no chemical or biological agents against R. necatrix have been registered for use on avocado in South Africa. Fluazinam has shown promising results in the greenhouse and field in other countries, including Spain. The current study aimed to investigate the potential of a fumigant, chloropicrin, and biological control agents (B-Rus, Beta-Bak, Mity-Gro, and Trichoderma) against R. necatrix both in vitro and in vivo as compared with fluazinam. In a greenhouse trial, results showed that Trichoderma and B-Rus were as effective as fluazinam at inhibiting R. necatrix in vitro and suppressed WRR symptoms when applied before inoculation with R. necatrix. In contrast, Mity-Gro and Beta-Bak failed to inhibit the pathogen in vitro and in the greenhouse trial, despite application of the products to plants before R. necatrix infection. Fluazinam suppressed WRR symptoms in plants when applied at the early stages of infection, whereas chloropicrin rendered the pathogen nonviable when used as a preplant treatment. Plants treated with Trichoderma, B-Rus, and fluazinam sustained dry mass production and net CO2 assimilation by maintaining the green leaf tissues despite being infected with the pathogen. This study has important implications for the integrated management of WRR.",

Temperature of 150 °C allowed the highest recovery of oligosaccharides (14.3 g oligosaccharides/100 g AP) and high recovery of antioxidant phenolics (3.48 g gallic acid equivalents/100 g AP and 10.80 g Trolox equivalents/100 g AP measured with ABTS●+ assay). The liquor obtained at this temperature was characterized by TGA and FTIR to study its thermal stability and functional groups. UHPLC-TOF MS analysis of an ethyl acetate extract of AP liquor enabled the tentative identification of 43 compounds, belonging to various metabolite families, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, organic acids, lignans and fatty acids. These findings demonstrated that autohydrolysis of AP is a suitable technology to obtain bioactive agents with potential uses in food and cosmetic industries.",

The exposure of fruits to exogenous ethylene (C2H4) treatment can accelerate the process of fruit ripening. The aim of this work was at improving the existing knowledge about the quality traits of avocado cv. Hass fruits at the ready-to-eat stage. The most important qualitative traits (weight loss, dry matter content, hardness pulp, and external and internal fruit colour) were evaluated up to 96 hours, maintaining the fruit at two different temperatures, T1 (+8°C) and T2 (+17°C). A trained sensory panel was conducted at 96 hours to confirm the quality of avocado cv. Hass ripened with exogenous C2H4."

There were measured the contents of moisture, dry matter, fat, total (TPC) and ten individual phenols, antioxidant activity (ABTS and DPPH), and total sterols; as well as the profiles of eight fatty acids and fourteen sterols/stanols. The values of raw and processed foods were compared and studied with multivariate analysis. The antioxidant capacity of AVO lowered after deep frying but augmented in eggplant and water after all treatments. The TPC was steady in AVO and raised in fried eggplant. Thermal treatments added to the initial profiles of the AVO, eggplant and water, nine, eight, and four phenols, respectively. Percentages of the main fatty acids (oleic, palmitic and linoleic), and sterols (β-sitosterol, campesterol, and Δ5-avenasterol), remained unchanged between the raw and treated AVO; and the lipidic fractions from processed eggplant. Cooking leads to the movement of hydrophilic and lipophilic functional compounds between AVO, eggplant and water. Migration of sterols and unsaturated fatty acids from AVO to eggplant during deep frying and W/O boiling improved the functional properties of eggplant by adding the high biological value lipophilic fraction to the naturally occurring polyphenols."

We investigated the effects of avocado seed (AvS) powder on CsA-induced nephrotoxicity and immunosuppression in rats. The injection of CsA (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously, for 10 days) increased serum levels of creatinine, uric acid, and urea, and the renal levels of the malondialdehyde. It decreased creatinine clearance and the renal activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) and Na+/K+ ATPase. The administration of CsA also significantly downregulated the renal expression of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1 beta, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 genes, and increased renal DNA damage. Histopathological examination confirmed the biochemical and molecular alterations that accompanied CsA nephrotoxicity. All CsA-induced deleterious effects, except immunosuppression, were ameliorated by feeding rats on a basal diet supplemented with 5% AvS powder for 4 weeks. Importantly, AvS also maximized CsA's immunosuppressive effect. These findings suggest a potential ameliorative effect of AvS on CsA-induced nephrotoxicity, and AvS enhances CsA's immunosuppressive effect. Therefore, AvS might be used in combination with CsA in transplantation treatment to relieve the CsA-induced nephrotoxicity."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of a balloon-expandable covered stent in the treatment of complex aortoiliac artery disease. BACKGROUND: Peripheral intervention in complex aortoiliac disease still remains a challenge. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed symptomatic patients with aortoiliac disease who were treated with GORE® VIABAHN® VBX covered stent (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ). The primary study outcome was a 1-year primary patency without the necessity of any subsequent clinically-driven target revascularization (CD-TLR) based intervention. The proportion of technical success, defined in terms of the absence of residual stenosis, stent edge dissection, and procedure-related severe complications, was also reported. RESULTS: VBX covered stent was used in 231 patients. Key patient characteristics include mean age of 73.4 ± 9 years, 77% male, 45% diabetes, and 18% suffering from end-stage renal dysfunction on dialysis. TASC II CD lesions were observed in 51% patients, which included 81% calcified lesions. Combined therapy with standard self-expandable stent was performed in 40% patients. The technical success rate was 92.6%. During median follow-up after 13.1 months, the primary patency rate was estimated to be 93.4% (95% confidence interval, 90.0%-96.8%) at 12 months, whereas the rate of freedom from TLR was 95.3% (92.5%-98.2%). As per the univariate analysis, the TASC II classification, number of diseased regions, and chronic total occlusion were significantly associated with risk of restenosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the year-long AVOCADO study demonstrated that usage of the novel VBX covered stent has a patency-based advantage with reduced chances for subsequent revascularization procedures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although intake of Hass avocado has been cross-sectionally linked to lower abdominal obesity, knowledge of the effects of avocado consumption on abdominal adiposity and glycemic outcomes remains limited. OBJECTIVE: The effects of avocado consumption on abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT), and estimated β-cell function were evaluated. METHODS: A total of 105 adults aged 25-45 y (61% female) with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to an intervention (N = 53) that received a daily meal with 1 fresh Hass avocado or a control (N = 52) that received an isocaloric meal with similar ingredients without avocado for 12 wk. DXA was used to assess the primary outcomes of abdominal adiposity [visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT), and the ratio of VAT to SAAT (VS Ratio)]. Fasted glucose and insulin were used to assess the primary outcomes of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and β-cell function (Insulinogenic index) were estimated using an OGTT. Changes between groups were compared using an ANCOVA. Secondary analyses were conducted based on sex. RESULTS: The control group exhibited a greater reduction in SAAT [-54.5 ± 155.8 g (control) compared with 17.4 ± 155.1 g (treatment), P = 0.017] and increase in VS Ratio [0.007 ± 0.047 (control) compared with -0.011 ± 0.044 (treatment), P = 0.024]. Among females, the treatment group exhibited a greater reduction in VAT [1.6 ± 89.8 g (control) compared with -32.9 ± 81.6 g (treatment), P = 0.021] and VS Ratio [0.01 ± 0.05 (control) compared with -0.01 ± 0.03 (treatment), P = 0.001]. Among males, there was no significant difference between groups in changes in abdominal adiposity or glycemic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of 1 fresh Hass avocado changed abdominal adiposity distribution among females but did not facilitate improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity or β-cell function among adults with overweight and obesity.This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02740439.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:: A poor or unhealthy diet is responsible for an important fraction of ischemic stroke risk. Adherence to dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, rich in monounsaturated fatty acids mainly from olive oil, is associated with a lower stroke risk. Furthermore, lowering low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreases stroke recurrence. Interestingly, Avocado-substituted diets, which are also rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, significantly decrease LDL cholesterol levels. This study aims to evaluate whether a Mediterranean diet based on Avocados reduces LDL-C compared to a low-fat high-complex carbohydrate diet after 3 months of the intervention in patients who had a recent acute ischemic stroke. The trial will also assess safety and feasibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS:: Prospective, randomized open-label, blinded outcome assessment clinical trial. Participants are patients within a month of being admitted with an ischemic stroke, who consent and fulfil the eligibility criteria. Patients are randomly assigned to either diet intervention in a 1:1 ratio on top of the usual secondary prevention treatment. The intervention diet is: A).. Avocado-based Mediterranean diet with intake of 1/2 portion of Avocado per day and B).. The control diet is a low-fat high-complex carbohydrate diet. The main efficacy outcome is a reduction in plasma LDL-C levels at 3 months of the dietary intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes in the levels of serum lipid profile and serum inflammation markers, safety, and feasibility. A sample size of 200 patients was estimated to provide 80% power and 5% level of significance (10% loss and 5% crossover) to detect a minimum difference of 4.6 mg/dL in LDL-C after 3 months of intervention. CONCLUSION:: We hypothesize that an Avocado-based Mediterranean diet will further reduce the levels of LDL-cholesterol at 3 months compared to the control diet, and that the intervention is safe and feasible. REGISTRATION:: The study is registered under ADDSPISE at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Identifier NCT03524742. Protocol ID CAS-605 version 3.0 (May 2nd, 2019).",

We aimed to evaluate the effects of avocado/soy unsaponifiables (ASU) compound on serum antioxidant and oxidative stress in patients with Osteoarthritis. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial was performed. Fourty patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to two different sequences: 1) DP: received ASU for three months followed by three months placebo, 2) PD: received placebo for the first three months followed by three months ASU. The oxidant statue was evaluated by measurement of serum malonldialdehyde (MDA). The total antioxidant capacity (TAC), reduced glutathione (GSH) and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were also assessed. RESULTS: Mean serum of MDA level as a marker of oxidative stress significantly decreased in all patients after three months treatment with ASU (4.46 ± 0.11 nmol/L) compare with baseline and placebo levels (5 ± 0.15 and 5.82 ± 0.12 nmol/L respectively) (p<0.05). On the other hand, ASU resulted in positive changes in serum antioxidant levels (p<0.05). Mixed-effects model of variance analyses showed that ASU effect is regardless of the order of receiving medication (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data showed that Avocado/Soy Unsaponifiable can be an effective supplement in treatment of osteoarthritis through the control of the balance between antioxidant and oxidant molecular markers.",

      "abstract": "Avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is a tree native from central and eastern México that belongs to the Lauraceae family. Avocado has three botanical varieties known as Mexican (P. americana var. drymifolia), West Indian (P. americana var. americana), and Guatemalan (P. americana var. guatemalensis). It is an oil-rich fruit appreciated worldwide because of its nutritional value and the content of bioactive molecules. Several avocado molecules show attractive activities of interest in medicine. Avocado fatty acids have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors. Besides, this fruit possesses a high content of carotenoids and phenolic compounds with possible antifungal, anti-cancer and antioxidant activities. Moreover, several metabolites have been reported with anti-inflammatory effects. Also, an unsaponifiable fraction of avocado in combination with soybean oil is used for the treatment of osteoarthritis. The Mexican variety is native from México and is characterized by the anise aroma in leaves and by small thin-skinned fruits of rich flavor and excellent quality. However, the study of the bioactive molecules of the fruit has not been addressed in detail. In this work, we achieved a literature review on the inflammatory, immunomodulatory and cytotoxic properties of long-chain fatty acids and derivatives from Mexican avocado seed. Also, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the oil extracted from the avocado seed are referred. Finally, the antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and cytotoxic activities of some antimicrobial peptides expressed in the fruit are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "In January and March 2019, an inspection of 11 commercial 'Hass' avocado orchards in mid-North and Tauranga (New Zealand) was conducted by NZ Avocado Growers Association Inc. (NZAGA) and the samples were sent to Plant Diagnostics Limited for investigation of a newly observed fruit staining symptom termed \"tannin stain\". Fruit symptoms consisted of areas of minute small spots which coalesced into areas of tear staining associated with water movement over the fruit's surface (Supplementary Fig. 1). Up to seven trees per orchard were sampled targeting symptomatic fruit with the aim of determining the cause of the problem. Fruit was surface disinfected for 4 minutes in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution and sections from lesions were plated on agar medium (prune extract agar) to isolate any plant pathogens. The predominant fungi isolated, represented species in the Colletotrichum acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. boninense species complexes. Since the morphological characters within these complexes overlap (see Supplementary Fig. 2 for examples), the isolates were differentiated by amplification and sequencing of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) gene and, where necessary, the calmodulin (CAL) gene and/or the Apn2-Mat1-2 intergenic spacer region (ApMat) locus (Weir et al., 2012; Rojas et al., 2010). The sequence analysis revealed eight Colletotrichum species comprising C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. cigarro, C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. karstii, C. perseae, and C. siamense. This range included three species that have not previously been recorded in New Zealand: C. fructicola (Cf), C. perseae (Cp), and C. siamense (Cs). Colonies for all these three fungi were white to grey with salmon-coloured and black acervuli. Conidia were aseptate, hyaline, straight, cylindrical, with broadly rounded ends, forming on cylindrical conidiogenous cells. The respective GPDH, CAL, and/or ApMat sequences of the Cf, Cp, and Cs isolates were identical to reference sequences of representative isolates in GenBank (e.g. ApMat: Cf - KX620181, Cp - KX620177, Cs - KP703788). An isolate for each species is stored in the International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants (Cf - ICMP22409, Cp - ICMP22431, Cs - ICMP22411) and sequences are deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MT522858-MT522865). Pathogenicity of each of the newly recorded species was confirmed on freshly picked 'Hass' avocado fruit. After surface disinfection with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 minutes, fruit was triple washed with sterile water and air dried. Five fruits per species were pin-pricked and inoculated with 10µL of conidial suspension (7 x 106 to 1 x 107 conidia/mL) prepared with sterile water containing Tween 20 (1µL/mL H2O) from 6-day-old cultures grown on PDA. Control fruit was pin-pricked and mock-inoculated with sterile water containing Tween 20 (1µL/mL H2O). All fruit was incubated in moist chambers at 25°C for 7 days. The three Colletotrichum species produced anthracnose symptoms on inoculated fruit whereas no symptoms were observed on control fruit (Supplementary Fig. 3). Each one of the species was successfully re-isolated from symptomatic tissue and identified using the methods described above, fulfilling Koch's postulates. While Cf and Cs have been reported from several hosts and countries to date (Weir et al. 2012), Cp has only been found from avocado in Israel (Sharma et al. 2017) and grape in Japan (Yokosawa et al. 2020). Although a number of species from the C. gloeosporioides species complex, i.e. C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. cigarro, and C. gloeosporioides have been previously associated with avocado diseases in New Zealand, the detections of Cf, Cp, and Cs represent first records. In this study, eight Colletotrichum species were associated with the \"tannin stain\" fruit symptoms in New Zealand avocado orchards. The individual contribution of the newly recorded pathogens Cf, Cp, and Cs to the observed disease symptoms was not determined, but their detection highlights the importance of sequence-based identification of Colletotrichum species, as morphology is insufficiently robust to separate cryptic species. Accurate identification of pathogens provides knowledge of species biodiversity that may be useful in biosecurity decision making. Since it has been reported that fungicide treatment efficiencies differ for some closely related Colletotrichum species on grape (Yokosawa et al. 2020), accurate identification might also contribute to establishing effective management strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Avocados are rich in dietary fiber and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), nutrients that have been independently connected to metabolic health benefits and the gastrointestinal microbiota. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the impact of avocado consumption on the gastrointestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites, secondary outcomes of the Persea americana for Total Health (PATH) study, and conduct exploratory analyses to assess relations between the fecal microbiota, fecal metabolites, and health markers. METHODS: Adults [n = 163, 25-45 y, BMI (kg/m2) ≥ 25.0] were enrolled in the PATH study, a 12-wk investigator-blinded trial where participants were batch randomized to match the 2 groups by age, sex, visceral adiposity, and fasting glucose concentrations. Participants consumed isocaloric meals with or without avocado (175 g, men; 140 g, women) once daily for 12 wk. The fecal microbiota was assessed with 16S ribosomal RNA gene (V4 region) sequencing and analysis using DADA2 and QIIME2. Fecal fatty acid and bile acid concentrations were quantified using GC and LC-MS. Per-protocol (≥80% meal consumption) and intent-to-treat analyses were conducted using univariate ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U tests. Bivariate correlations were conducted between fecal microbiota, fecal metabolites, and health measures. RESULTS: The avocado treatment increased ɑ diversity and enriched Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, and Alistipes between 26% and 65% compared with the control group. The avocado group had 18% greater fecal acetate, 70% greater stearic acid, and 98% greater palmitic acid concentrations than the control group, while the concentrations of the bile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid were 91% and 57% lower, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Daily avocado consumption resulted in lower fecal bile acid concentrations, greater fecal fatty acid and SCFAs, and greater relative abundances of bacteria capable of fiber fermentation, providing evidence that this nutrient-dense food affects digestive physiology, as well as the composition and metabolic functions of the intestinal microbiota.

Scientific evidences suggest that medicinal plants with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and/or antiproliferative properties are potential alternatives for the treatment of endometriosis. The ethanol extract of Persea americana Mill. (Lauraceae) seeds was found exhibiting antiproliferative properties in vitro and in vivo. This study therefore is aimed at investigating the effects of such an extract on an experimental model of endometriosis. Endometriosis was induced by grafting uterine fragments onto the peritoneum of female Wistar rats. After checking the success of the transplantation surgery, animals with endometriosis were orally treated with the ethanol extract of P. americana seeds at the doses of 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg. The positive control was treated with letrozole (10 mg/kg) while the negative control received the vehicle. Treatments lasted 7 days and animals were sacrificed thereafter. Endometrial implant volume was determined. Estradiol and progesterone levels were measured in serum samples and endometriosis lesions. The oxidative status of endometriosis lesions was evaluated. Histological analysis of endometriosis lesions, uterus, and ovaries was also performed. Results showed that the ethanol extract of P. americana seeds decreased endometrial implant volume (p < 0.001) and serum levels of estradiol and progesterone (p < 0.01). The levels of estradiol also decreased in endometriosis lesions at doses of 12.5 and 50 mg/kg (p < 0.001). Both malondialdehyde and glutathione levels increased in endometriosis lesions (p < 0.001). The ectopic endometrium height decreased and the number of antral follicles and corpora lutea (p < 0.05) increased while that of luteinized unruptured follicles decreased (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the ethanol extract of P. americana seeds displayed an antiendometriosis effect suggesting that it could be a potential alternative for the treatment of endometriosis."

Here, an avocado-like Fe3+/Fe2O3 composed T1-T2 dual-mode contrast agent based on Fe-TA coordination network (CNMN) is developed. This material possesses suitable longitudinal and transverse relaxation coefficients. Moreover, the strong heat generation property of Fe-TA endows CNMN with the capability to act as a potent photothermal agent. Furthermore, CNMN can also act as an effective delivery platform for the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve high effective chemo-photothermal combination therapy.

      "abstract": "The goal of the current study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of Arthrocen against acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. Acute inflammation was produced through intrarectal administration of 2 ml diluted acetic acid (4%) solution. All interventions were carried out for 5 days after colitis induction. Arthrocen was administered orally at doses of 30, 60, and 120 mg kg-1  day-1 . Then, macroscopic and microscopic studies were performed. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activity were measured by biochemical and ELISA methods, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was done to investigate the expression of pNF-κB. The results of this study demonstrated that Arthrocen reduced macroscopic and microscopic damage compared to the acetic acid group. Furthermore, Arthrocen decreased the activity of MPO and TNF-α as well as the protein expression of pNF-kB in rat colon tissue. The results of the current study revealed the anti-inflammatory activity of Arthrocen in acetic acid mediated colon inflammation through suppressing the NF-κB pathway. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immune-mediated chronic relapsing disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) characterized by chronic bowel inflammation. A plant-based dietary supplement containing avocado and soy unsaponifiable extracts in a ratio of 1:2 is known as Arthrocen. Arthrocen can be used as a complementary drug beside current drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of IBD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The relationship between vascular damage and diabetes mellitus was exploited using avocado seed extracts. The purpose of the study was to understand the therapeutic relevance of glycosides compared to standard vascular and anti-diabetic drugs. Constituent Avocado Seed Glycosides (ASG) were analysed and administered to rats with Diabetes-Induced Vascular Damage (DIVD). METHODS: The rats were first administered with streptozotocin and screened after seven days for alterations in blood glucose, insulin, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), Von Willebrand factor (VWF), Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAS), eNOx, and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Only rats that satisfied these criteria were recruited and treated with either glibenclamide, met.su + losart, or 200 mg/kg body weight ASG for 28 days. RESULTS: There was an abundance of digitoxin (13.41 mg/100g), digoxin (17.98 mg/100g), avicularin (165.85 mg/100g), and hyperoside (282.51 mg/100g). ASG or met.su + losart exhibited slight modulatory properties on glucose homeostasis. Rats with DIVD showed elevated renin, angiotensin, VCAM-1 and Lp-PLA2 levels but slightly decreased with glibenclamide treatment and normalized with ASG or met.su + losart administration. All treatments normalized Hcy levels. DIVD caused the overproduction of CnT, LDH, Crt-K, LDL-c, TG, and TC and suppressed HDL-c but was completely normalized by the ASG. Water intake remained altered in treated rats. CONCLUSION: The ASG had no relevant effect on glucose homeostasis during DIVD but showed significant vasoprotective properties.",

Antagonistic microorganisms against C. gloeosporioides represent an alternative for biological control. Accordingly, in the present study, we focused on the isolation and characterization of potential antagonist bacteria against a member of the C. gloeosporioides species complex with respect to their possible future application. RESULTS: Samples of avocado rhizospheric soil were aquired from an orchard located in Ocuituco, Morelos, Mexico, aiming to obtain bacterial isolates with potential antifungal activity. From the soil samples, 136 bacteria were isolated and they were then challenged against a member of the C. gloeosporioides species complex; only three bacterial isolates A1, A2 and A3 significantly diminished mycelial fungal growth by 75%, 70% and 60%, respectively. Two of these isolates were identified by 16S rRNA as Bacillus mycoides (A1 and A2) and the third was identified as Bacillus tequilensis (A3). Bacillus mycoides bacterial cell-free supernatant reduced the mycelial growth of a member of the C. gloeosporioides species complex isolated from avocado by 65%, whereas Bacillus tequilensis A3 supernatant did so by 25% after 3 days post inoculation. Bacillus tequilensis mycoides A1 was a producer of proteases, indolacetic acid and siderophores. Preventive treatment using a cell-free supernatant of B. mycoides A1 diminished the severity of anthracnose disease (41.9%) on avocado fruit. CONCLUSION: These results reveal the possibility of using B. mycoides A1 as a potential biological control agent. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",

We determine the effect of wood biochar on avocado growth, fruit production and economic benefit. Biochar was applied at 0%, 5%, 10% and 20% volume by volume basis. Biochar significantly improved the growth of avocado seedlings and increased fruit yield in the first three years after planting. There was an overall increase in soil carbon, fruit yield, tree diameter and height in all biochar treatments relative to the control over the seasons. Trees planted with biochar had 18-26% greater growth rates (in terms of height and stem diameter) than the control. Tree diameter was significantly greater with biochar (145.4 ± 3.3 mm) relative to the control treatment (125.0 ± 2.7 mm). Tree height was also significantly greater with biochar (3.7 ± 0.1 m) relative to the control treatment (3.4 ± 0.1 m). The fruit count from the biochar row was significantly greater (97%) in 2018. Heavy bearing trees typically have a lower yield in the subsequent year but despite this, the 2019 fruit counts were higher in aggregate for the biochar amended trees (20%) relative to the control. A cost-benefit analysis indicated that if yield surplus of fruit trees continued for three years, and assuming avocado prices remain at similar levels, then the discounted net benefit over a hectare would amount to US$8581, or US$105 per metric tonne of biochar applied.",

      "abstract": "Despite the excellent antimicrobial activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics, permanent inner ear damage associated with the use of these drugs has resulted in the need to develop strategies to address the ototoxic risk given their widespread use. In a previous study, we showed that avocado oil protects ear hair cells from damage caused by neomycin. However, the detailed mechanism by which this protection occurs is still unclear. Here, we investigated the auditory cell-protective mechanism of enhanced functional avocado oil extract (DKB122). RNA sequencing followed by pathway analysis revealed that DKB122 has the potential to enhance the expression of detoxification and antioxidant genes associated with glutathione metabolism (Hmox4, Gsta4, Mgst1, and Abcc3) in HEI-OC1 cells. Additionally, DKB122 effectively decreased ROS levels, resulting in the inhibition of apoptosis in HEI-OC1 cells. The expression of the inflammatory genes that encode chemokines and interleukins was also downregulated by DKB122 treatment. Consistent with these results, DKB122 significantly inhibited p65 nuclear migration induced by TNF-α or LPS in HEI-OC1 cells and THP-1 cells and the expression of inflammatory chemokine and interleukin genes induced by TNF-α was significantly reduced. Moreover, DKB122 treatment increased LC3-II and decreased p62 in HEI-OC1 cells, suggesting that DKB122 increases autophagic flux. These results suggest that DKB122 has otoprotective effects attributable to its antioxidant activity, induction of antioxidant gene expression, anti-inflammatory activity, and autophagy activation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Avocados are rich in unsaturated fat and fiber; clinical trials have investigated their effects on metabolic disease. There is high variability in individual changes following avocado consumption, which may be in part due to individual genetic differences. OBJECTIVE: Secondary analyses of the Persea americana for Total Health (PATH) Study were used to examine how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) impact blood lipid changes following a daily meal containing avocado compared with control. METHODS: Adults (n = 115, 37% male) aged 25-45 y with overweight and obesity were randomly assigned to receive a daily isocaloric meal with (intervention) or without (control) a standardized amount (males: 175 g; females: 140 g) of avocado for 12 wk. Control meals were higher in saturated fat (17% of energy compared with 7%) and lower in fiber (4 g compared with 16 g) than intervention meals. Whole venous blood was taken at baseline and 12 wk to determine total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) concentrations. Seventeen SNPs in 10 genes related to lipoprotein metabolism were genotyped. Effects of SNP, diet, and SNP-diet interactions were determined using general linear models. RESULTS: No group-by-time effects were detected for changes in TC (P = 0.96), HDL cholesterol (P = 0.28), or TG (P = 0.06) over 12 wk. Three SNP-diet interactions were associated with final TC concentrations: ANGPTL3-rs10889337 (P = 0.01), ANGPTL4-rs2278236 (P = 0.02), and CD36-rs10499859 (P = 0.01). SNPs in GCKR and LPL were associated with TC changes (P = 0.01). The interaction between GCKR-rs1260326 and diet was such that C-homozygotes receiving avocado (n = 23) had final TC concentrations that were significantly lower than the C-homozygotes in the control group (n = 20) (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Results from these exploratory analyses indicate that avocado consumption may help manage dyslipidemia in adults with overweight and obesity; however, effectiveness may differ by genetic profile. Understanding the role of genetic variation in variability following dietary intervention can potentially inform personalized nutrition recommendations.",

The effects of honey samples on membrane potential, membrane integrity, and metabolic activity were assessed using different fluorochromes, in a 180 min time course assay. Time-kill experiments were also carried out under similar conditions. Exposure of S. aureus and E. coli to the distinct honey samples resulted in physiological changes related to membrane polarization and membrane integrity. Moreover, honey induced a remarkable metabolic disruption as primary physiological effect upon S. aureus. The different honey samples induced quite similar effects on both bacteria. However, the depth of bacteria response throughout the treatment varied depending on the concentration tested and among honey varieties, probably due to compositional differences in the honey.",

Ginger and avocado are used for many people all around the world; however, its effect as a nutraceutical compound is less known by the general population. For this reason, we searched information of the literature to point its effects on distinct mechanisms of defense against the obesity its comorbidities. The present review aimed showing that these nutraceuticals may be useful in obesity treatment. Reports have shown that ginger and avocado induce antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by improving enzymatic activity and modulating obesity-related impairments in the anti-inflammatory system in different tissues, without side effects.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the preparation and evaluation of the safety and efficacy of saffron extract and avocado oil used for anti-wrinkle topical cream. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Oil in water cream was prepared containing avocado oil and the saffron extract. Accelerated stability tests were carried out due to 6 months accordingly through the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guideline. For clinical studies, topical cream was applied by twenty healthy volunteers daily, for 12 weeks. Improvement in wrinkle grading by a Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GIAS), depth and volume of the nasolabial fold, thickness, and density of dermis, and determination of the skin biophysical parameters were evaluated at the baseline, 6th and 12th week. RESULT: During the period of storage, the formulation showed no variation in physicochemical properties. The clinical evaluation showed at least one-grade improvement in GIAS in 30% and 45% of participants, after 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Subjects were \"moderately satisfied\" with the treatment. In addition, the area and volume of nasolabial folds were significantly reduced. Moreover, net elasticity (R5) and gross elasticity (R2) showed a significant increase after 12 weeks of treatment. There was no report of allergic reactions, and no changes in skin hydration occurred during the treatment. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that saffron extract and avocado oil anti-wrinkle topical cream is an efficient and safe treatment for facial skin rejuvenation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Excess adiposity increases risk for cognitive impairment. Consumption of avocado, a highly bioavailable source of the xanthophyll lutein, has been shown to improve retinal lutein accumulation and cognitive function. Thus, we evaluated the influence of avocado consumption on cognitive function and lutein status among adults with overweight and obesity using a randomized-controlled trial with matching design for pertinent study outcomes. METHODS: A cohort of 84 adults (25-45 years, 31 males) were randomized to a treatment group (N = 47) that received a 12-week daily meal with fresh Hass avocado or a control group (N = 37) that received an isocaloric meal (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02740439). Serum lutein and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) were used to assess xanthophyll status. Attention and inhibition were assessed using the Flanker, Oddball and Nogo tasks with accompanying electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. RESULTS: Participants in the treatment group exhibited improvements in serum lutein and accuracy in the Flanker task. However, there were no relationships between performance and changes in lutein status, nor neuroelectric variables. No significant changes in MPOD were observed. CONCLUSION: Daily avocado intake over 12 weeks, after controlling for covariates, improved attentional inhibition and increased serum lutein concentrations among adults with overweight and obesity. However, the cognitive benefits were independent of changes in lutein concentrations. Additional work is necessary to determine non-carotenoid, or carotenoid interactive, mechanisms by which avocados may influence cognitive function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Avocados are a nutrient-dense source of MUFAs and are rich in antioxidants. Avocados have an additional LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering effect beyond that observed when their MUFAs are substituted for SFAs, especially on small, dense LDL (sdLDL) particles, which are susceptible to in vivo oxidation and associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether a healthy diet with 1 avocado daily decreased the following secondary outcomes: circulating oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and related oxidative stress markers. METHODS: A randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial was conducted with 45 men and women, aged 21-70 y, with overweight or obesity and elevated LDL-C (25th-90th percentile). Three cholesterol-lowering diets were provided (5 wk each) in random sequences: a lower-fat (LF) diet (24% calories from fat-7% SFAs, 11% MUFAs, 6% PUFAs) and 2 moderate-fat (MF) diets (34% calories from fat-6% SFAs, 17% MUFAs, 9% PUFAs): the avocado (AV) diet included 1 Hass avocado (∼136 g) per day, and the MF diet used high oleic acid oils to match the fatty acid profile of 1 avocado. A general linear mixed model was used to analyze the treatment effects. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, the AV diet significantly decreased circulating oxLDL (-7.0 U/L, -8.8%, P = 0.0004) and increased plasma lutein concentration (19.6 nmol/L, 68.7%, P < 0.0001), and both changes differed significantly from that after the MF and LF diets (P ≤ 0.05). The change in oxLDL caused by the AV diet was significantly correlated with the changes in the number of sdLDL particles (r = 0.32, P = 0.0002) but not large, buoyant LDL particles. CONCLUSIONS: One avocado a day in a heart-healthy diet decreased oxLDL in adults with overweight and obesity, and the effect was associated with the reduction in sdLDL. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01235832.",

      "abstract": "Bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) are capable of initiating an innate immune response (IIR) to invading bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus is not classically an intracellular pathogen, although it has been shown to be internalized into bMECs. S. aureus internalizes into nonprofessional phagocytes, which allows the evasion of the IIR and turns antimicrobial therapy unsuccessful. An alternative treatment to control this pathogen is the modulation of the innate immune response of the host. The Mexican avocado (Persea americana var. drymifolia) is a source of molecules with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Hence, we analyze the effect of a lipid-rich extract from avocado seed (LEAS) on S. aureus internalization into bMECs and their innate immunity response. The effects of LEAS (1-500 ng/ml) on the S. aureus growth and bMEC viability were assessed by turbidimetry and MTT assays, respectively. LEAS did not show neither antimicrobial nor cytotoxic effects. S. aureus internalization into bMECs was analyzed by gentamicin protection assays. Interestingly, LEAS (1-200 ng/ml) decreased bacterial internalization (60-80%) into bMECs. This effect correlated with NO production and the induction of the gene expression of IL-10, while the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α was reduced. These effects could be related to the inhibition of MAPK p38 (∼60%) activation by LEAS. In conclusion, our results showed that LEAS inhibits the S. aureus internalization into bMECs and modulates the IIR, which indicates that avocado is a source of metabolites for control of mastitis pathogens.",

However, the term \"superfood\" can be vague and misleading, as it is often associated with unrealistic health claims. This review draws a comprehensive summary and assessment of research performed in the last few decades to understand the nutritional and therapeutic properties of avocado and its bioactive compounds. In particular, studies reporting the major metabolites of avocado, their antioxidant as well as bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties, are summarized and assessed. Furthermore, the potential of avocado in novel drug discovery for the prevention and treatment of cancer, microbial, inflammatory, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases is highlighted. This review also proposes several interesting future directions for avocado research."

Robust and sensitive root quantification methods are required for determining seasonal P. cinnamomi root colonization patterns and evaluating management strategies. Our study investigated four P. cinnamomi root quantification methods using a newly developed P. cinnamomi-avocado-seedling bioassay system and a P. cinnamomi-specific probe-based qPCR assay. Phytophthora cinnamomi quantification through plating of roots (root plating) or lemon leaf disks obtained from root baitings (root-baiting-plating) onto semi-selective media were the best methods. Root plating consistently yielded significant differences in P. cinnamomi quantities obtained from seedling roots inoculated with five zoospore concentrations (10-1 × 105 zoospores/ml), whereas root-baiting-plating did so less often. The two methods were comparable in yielding root quantities that were significantly correlated with the inoculated zoospore concentrations, rarely yielding false negatives and having the lowest variability between replicates of the same treatment. qPCR quantification from roots was also an effective method; however, treatment replicates were highly variable and false negatives occurred more frequently. The least effective quantification method was qPCR quantification from lemon leaf disks obtained from root baitings.",

The effect of including an avocado daily as part of a hypocaloric weight-loss diet on weight loss is not known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of daily avocado consumption as part of a hypocaloric diet on weight loss, body composition, satiety, biomarkers of inflammation, and intestinal microbiota composition. METHODS: In this randomized, parallel-controlled, open-label, 2-arm intervention study, 51 healthy overweight/obese women and men were assigned to a hypocaloric diet with 1 Hass avocado daily (AVO; n = 24) or a hypocaloric diet (CTRL; n = 27) without daily avocado for 12 wk. Serum markers and intestinal microbiota were analyzed at baseline and week 12. RESULTS: Both groups experienced significant weight loss, decrease in BMI (in kg/m2), total body fat, and visceral adipose tissue, respectively (AVO: -2.3 ± 2 kg, -0.8 ± 0.8, -1.1% ± 2%, and -81.2 ± 118 g; CTRL: -2.6 ± 3.6 kg, -0.9 ± 1, -1.5% ± 2%, and -87.4 ± 216 g). We observed a significant decrease in serum glucose over time in the control group compared with the AVO group. There was no change between the groups in serum triglyceride, but a significant decrease from baseline to 12 wk was observed in the AVO group. Serum hepatic growth factor (HGF) and relative proportion of bacterial phyla (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes), family (Bacteroidaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae), and genus (Bacteroides, Clostridium, Methanosphaera, and Candidatus Soleaferrea) were significantly altered in the AVO group compared with the CTRL group. A trend to decrease in serum inflammatory factors IL-1β (P = 0.07) and C-reactive protein (P = 0.074) was observed in the AVO group compared with CTRL. CONCLUSIONS: Daily Hass avocado consumption as part of a hypocaloric diet supported weight loss, a decrease in serum HGF, and an increase in the abundance of bacteria involved in plant polysaccharide fermentation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02953158."

      "abstract": "Adsorption is an effective method for the treatment of wastewater containing low concentrations of heavy metals. This kind of metals such as Chromium and Lead could affect health and the ecosystem. In this work, biomass of avocado seed was used as adsorbent. It was tested as adsorbent in natural form (NB), as a chemically activated (AB) form and as activated carbon (AC). Batch reactors were used to investigate the adsorbent efficiency. Concentration of metal ions was measured using Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence. Operational conditions influencing adsorption, such as: pH, adsorbent dose, initial concentration and contact time, were measured and controlled. The 80% of adsorption was reached, at pH: 5 and 25 °C, when were used 50 mL of: a 20 mg L-1 of Cr (VI) solution with a dose of 1.25 g of NB, a 30 mg L-1 of Pb (II) solution with a dose of 0.15 g of NB, a 50 mg L-1 Pb (II) solution with a dose of 0.15 g of AB, a 30 mg L-1 Cr (VI) solution with a dose of 0.35 g of AB, a 30 mg L-1 of both metals, with a dose of 0.15 g of AC for Pb (II) and 0.7 g of AC for Cr (VI). In all cases, the pH value before and during the experiments remained constant, indicating the lack of acid/base reactions during the processes. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model best fitted to the experimental data. The experimental results from kinetic studies best correlated using the pseudo-second order model. An increase in the remotion of both ions (Pb (II) and Cr (VI)), was observed when comparing the results obtained using the activated biomass. However, considering the loss of biomass that the pre-treatment causes, the remotion per gram of initial biomass does not vary significantly.",

DATA SOURCES: Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials. STUDY SELECTION: Original studies were randomized placebo-controlled trials evaluating the effect of orally administered ASU on knee or hip OA symptoms using the Lequesne index, visual analog scale (VAS) and/or joint space width (JSW). DATA EXTRACTION: Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model and generic inverse variance method. Heterogeneity was tested using the I2 statistic index. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avocado-soybean unsaponifiables therapy had a significant reduction on pain by VAS assessment (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -9.64 mm, 95% CI: -17.43, -1.84; P = .02; I2  = 92%). A subanalysis according to the type of OA showed that ASU significantly decreased both VAS and Lequesne index in knee OA (WMD: -17.36, 95% CI: -25.91, -8.82; P < .0001; I2  = 87% and WMD: -2.33, 95% CI: -2.88, -1.78; P < .00001; I2  = 18%, respectively) but not in hip OA. Finally, ASU supplementation showed no significant differences for adverse events compared to placebo (relative risk: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.25; P = .88; I2  = 0%). CONCLUSION: Results of this meta-analysis suggest a beneficial effect of ASU treatment in symptomatic knee OA but not in hip OA. Additionally, adverse events were similar in patients receiving ASU therapy or placebo.",

Therefore, finding new antioxidant sources might be beneficial for its treatment. Avocado Persea americana is a fruit widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide. Although avocado by-products in the form of peel, seed coat and seeds are currently of no commercial use, they constitute a natural source of bioactive compounds. Methanolic (80%) extract obtained from lyophilized ground peels, seed coats, and seeds of the avocado Hass, Fuerte, Reed and Colinred varieties were analyzed for their total phenolic content (TPC) and their correlations with antioxidant capacity (AC) were assessed by ABTS, FRAP, and ORAC assays. For all varieties, the var. Colinred peel shows the highest TPC and AC. Further analysis showed that the var. Colinred peel presented major phenolic compounds B-type procyanidins and epicatechin according to HPLC-MS. The antioxidant effect of peel extract was evaluated upon in vivo oxidative stress (OS) model. We show for the first time that the peel extract can protect and/or prevent transgenic parkinDrosophila melanogaster fly against paraquat-induced OS, movement impairment and lipid peroxidation, as model of PD. Our findings offer an exceptional opportunity to test natural disease-modifying substances from avocado's by-products.",
