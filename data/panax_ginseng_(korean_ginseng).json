      "abstract": "The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family is one of the largest and oldest protein families and encodes a class of transmembrane transporter proteins that transport substances in living organisms. Panax ginseng is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, and its main active ingredient is ginsenoside, a secondary metabolite. Transportation and accumulation of secondary metabolites require the participation of ABC transporter proteins. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the ginseng ABC transporter family using bioinformatics tools. Analysis of 106 PgABC genes showed that they were classified into seven subfamilies, among which ABCG was the most abundant subfamily. Chromosomal localization and covariance analyses showed that PgABC genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes and that tandem repeat sequences existed. Tissue expression analyses revealed that PgABC expression was tissue-specific in ginseng. Cis-acting element analyses showed that PgABC genes responded to induction by hormones such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis of MeJA-treated ginseng adventitious roots revealed dynamic expression changes in nine PgABC genes, with PgABC14, PgABC18, and PgABC24-01 showing significant upregulation. The identification and analysis of the ABC transporter family in ginseng lays a theoretical foundation for the subsequent study of the function of the ABC gene family in ginseng and provides a theoretical basis for the study of ABC transporter proteins in other medicinal plant species.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a frontline chemotherapeutic, but its side-effects from oxidative stress, leading to cardiotoxicity, pose significant challenges to its clinical use. We recently discovered a novel family of proteolysis-resistant, cystine-dense, and cell-penetrating microproteins from Panax ginseng that we term ginsentides. Ginsentides, such as the 31-residue TP1, coordinate multiple biological systems to prevent vascular dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by internal and external stressors. (2) Methods: We assessed the protective effects of ginsentide TP1 on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity using both in vitro functional studies on H9c2 cardiomyocytes and in vivo animal models by zebrafish and ICR mouse models. In these models, we examined oxidative stress, apoptosis, intracellular calcium levels, mitochondrial function, inflammatory responses, and cardiac function. (3) Results: We show that ginsentide TP1 protects against DOX-induced cytotoxicity in the mitochondria-rich H9c2 cardiomyocytes and reduces myocardial injury in zebrafish and mice by mitigating oxidative stress, inflammation, calcium, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as apoptosis-mediated cell death. Importantly, TP1 preserves cellular homeostasis without compromising the anticancer potency of DOX in breast cancer cells. (4) Conclusions: our findings highlight a specific antioxidative function of ginsentide TP1 in managing DOX-induced cardiotoxicity during cancer treatment and provide a promising lead for developing cardioprotective peptides and microproteins against oxidative stress."

Diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction (DMED) affects various aspects of the patient's quality of life, mental well-being, and relationship dynamics. Given the increasing incidence of DM worldwide, the incidence of DMED is expected to increase accordingly. There are more challenges to treat DMED compared to non-DMED. The efficacy of oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors is often ineffective in DMED and there is a need to search for effective drugs. Medicinal plants such as Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. Leaf, Cordycep militaris have been used in treating DMED in some experiments. And some ingredients from the medicinal plants such as Icariside II, Panax notoginseng Saponins have also shown to be beneficial in improving erectile function in animal models of DMED. These medicinal plants and ingredients may act by regulating hormone levels, ameliorating oxidative damage, and promoting NO/cGMP. We summarize the challenges in treating DMED due to related complicated pathogenesis and limited therapeutic options, while particularly highlight the role of the medicinal plants and their ingredients in DMED.",

Panax ginseng, a widely used herbal supplement renowned for its adaptogenic properties, is hypothesized to alleviate some stress effects. This study aims to evaluate the impact of hydroponically grown Red Panax ginseng root powder with a high level of rare ginsenosides supplementation on perceived stress levels, as well as on the emotional and cognitive abilities of moderately stressed participants. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted with 149 participants. They were randomly assigned to either the Ginseng supplementation group (N = 72; 200 mg/day, including 24 mg of ginsenosides) or the Placebo group (N = 77). The intervention lasted for 3 weeks. The perceived stress level was measured at baseline (D0) and at the end of the intervention (D21) using a validated scale (PSS) alongside assessments of emotional (BDI and PANAS) and cognitive abilities (CANTAB subtests). Results: Significantly larger decreases in the PSS and negative affect score (PANAS) were observed following intervention in the Ginseng group compared with the Placebo group. Compared to the Placebo group, participants in the Ginseng group showed faster response latencies during a spatial planning task (OTSC subtest). In addition, there was a marginally larger decrease in the BDI score in the Ginseng group. Conclusions: These results confirm the emotional and cognitive benefits of Red Panax ginseng in moderately stressed adults and pave the way for further exploration of its use as a promising approach to improving psychological well-being.",

      "abstract": "In crop growth, irrigation has to be adjusted according to developmental stages. Smart agriculture requires the accurate prediction of growth status and timely intervention to improve the quality of agricultural products, but this task faces significant challenges due to variable environmental factors. To address this issue, this study proposes a data-driven irrigation method to enhance crop yield. Our approach harvests extensive datasets to train and optimize an integrated deep-learning architecture combining Informer, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) models. Controlled greenhouse experiments validated the reliability and practicality of the proposed prediction and intervention strategy. The results showed that the model accurately issued irrigation warnings 3-5 days in advance. Compared to traditional fixed irrigation, the model significantly reduced irrigation frequency while maintaining the same or even better growth conditions. In terms of plant quantity, the experimental group increased by 410.0%, while the control group grew by 50.0%. Additionally, the experimental group's average plant height was 21.8% higher than that of the control group. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed irrigation prediction method in enhancing crop growth and yield, providing a novel strategy for future agricultural planning and management."

      "abstract": "With the acceleration of the pace of modern life and the increase of environmental pressure, women are facing increasingly prominent health problems, ovarian dysfunction will not only lead to fertility decline, but also may lead to a series of endocrine disorders, seriously affecting women's quality of life. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential role of American panax panax in improving ovarian dysfunction by activating the BDNF/AKT/Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathway via miR-151-5p based on infrared thermal imaging technology. The study constructed an animal model of ovarian dysfunction, and used infrared thermal imaging technology to monitor the ovarian region in real time and record its temperature changes to evaluate the treatment effect. Through these data, we analyzed the activation effect of American ginseng extract on the signaling pathway and its relationship with the improvement of ovarian function. The results of the study showed that the infrared thermography of the ovarian region treated with American ginseng extract showed a significant increase in temperature, indicating increased ovarian blood flow and enhanced metabolic activity. These changes suggest that American ginseng extract can effectively activate the BDNF/AKT/Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathway, thereby improving ovarian dysfunction. The results showed that American ginseng extract can effectively promote the repair and functional recovery of ovarian tissue, and infrared thermal imaging technology has a good application prospect in monitoring the therapeutic effect."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In China, the integration of Chinese traditional medicine with Western medicine for the treatment of multifactorial diseases provides notable therapeutic benefits. Given this integration involving co-administration of herbal medicines and synthetic drugs, it is critical to evaluate the potential for associated drug interactions. AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation aimed to evaluate an oral extract of Panax notoginseng roots (Sanqi) for its potential to induce CYP3A activity, which may contribute to herb-drug interactions. METHODS: Human microbiota-associated (HMA) rats were used to determine whether repeated oral administration of Sanqi extract induces CYP3A activity. Cryopreserved primary rat and human hepatocytes were used to evaluate the ability of ginsenoside metabolites and their combinations to induce rat Cyp3a and human CYP3A. Fecal samples from HMA rats repeatedly treated with oral Sanqi extract were analyzed for microbial deglycosylation activity on ppt-type ginsenosides. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure mRNA levels of rat Cyp3a1 and Cyp3a2, and human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantify ginsenosides and their metabolites in rat samples and in vitro study samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze intestinal microbiota composition. RESULTS: Repeated oral administration of Sanqi extract did not induce hepatic Cyp3a expression in rats. Neither ginsenoside metabolites nor their combinations induced rat Cyp3a or human CYP3A in vitro. Systemic exposure to oxidized metabolites of 20(S)-protopanaxtriol showed significant accumulation in HMA rats following repeated administration of Sanqi extract. This accumulation pattern mirrored previous findings in humans. The increased systemic exposure to the oxidized metabolites was likely due to enhanced microbial deglycosylation activity resulting from repeated oral administration of the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Oral Sanqi extract exhibits a low propensity to induce CYP3A. This limited potential for drug interactions supports its safe use in cardiovascular therapies, particularly in polypharmacy settings."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Saengmaek-san (SMS) is a herbal prescription comprising Liriope platyphylla, Panax ginseng, and Schisandra chinensis. In traditional Korean medicine (TKM), SMS has been used to treat a condition known as the dual deficiency of qi and yin in the lungs, a syndrome characterized by the depletion of vitality and body fluids, often resulting from heat exhaustion. SMS has primarily been used to promote fluid production, alleviate dry cough, and relieve progressive dyspnea. AIM OF THE STUDY: The current study was planned to explore the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of SMS in managing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the SMS water extract was administered at doses of 50, 150, and 450¬†mg/kg twice daily for 14 days. The extent of pulmonary fibrosis was assessed using the Ashcroft scale in stained lung tissues. The levels of transforming growth factor-Œ≤, Œ±-smooth muscle actin (Œ±-SMA), and collagen accumulation were also evaluated. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to measure the total cell counts, white blood cell ratios, and cytokine levels (IL-6 and IL-10). RESULTS: We observed statistically significant and potential anti-fibrotic effects in the SMS 450¬†mg/kg treatment group in terms of preventing body weight loss, decreasing Ashcroft scale, and reducing macrophage and granulocyte counts in BALF, as well as reducing Œ±-SMA and collagen production. Additionally, an increase was observed in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: SMS demonstrated potential as a therapeutic candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by exerting anti-inflammatory effects and reducing collagen deposition."

Its disease progression is closely related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Effective treatment is currently lacking. The traditional Chinese medicine ginseng (Panax ginseng) shows unique advantages in NAFLD intervention, but its complex compositional system and molecular mechanism network still need to be systematically analyzed. OBJECTIVE: This paper systematically integrates evidence from nearly 20¬†years of research to elucidate the multi-target pharmacological mechanism of ginseng for the treatment of NAFLD. METHODS: Relevant information was sourced from Pubmed, Web of science, Embase and CNKI databases. Using BioRender and visio to draw biomedical illustrations. RESULTS: The active ingredients of ginseng contain 2 classes of saponins (tetracyclic triterpene saponins, pentacyclic triterpene saponins and other modified types) and non-saponins. Different cultivation methods, processing techniques and extraction sites have expanded the variety of ginseng constituents and demonstrated different pharmacological activities. Studies have shown that ginseng and its functional components have the ability to regulate lipid metabolism disorders, inflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, insulin resistance, disruption of intestinal flora structure, cell death and senescence. Demonstrates the potential of ginseng for the treatment of NAFLD. CONCLUSION: This study reveals for the first time the integrative mechanism of ginseng in the treatment of NAFLD through the tertiary mode of action of \"multi-component multi-target multi-pathway\". The multilevel modulatory ability of ginseng provides a new direction for the development of comprehensive therapeutic strategies for NAFLD."

Jasmonates (JAs), a class of stress-induced phytohormones, are integral in modulating plant defense responses and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including ginsenosides. Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the primary bioactive JA compound, is biosynthesized by JA-Ile synthase 1 (JAR1). In this study, we cloned the 1555 bp PgJAR1 gene from ginseng roots and analyzed its structure, enzyme activity, and expression pattern. The PgJAR1 protein encompasses all the hallmark elements characteristic of the GH3 family. It exhibits N/C-terminal domains analogous to ANL, three ATP/AMP-binding motifs, and distinct secondary structures: an N-terminal beta-barrel with beta-sheets and alpha-helices, and a C-terminal beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices, similarly to AtGH3.11/AtJAR1. The recombinant PgJAR1 enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 specifically catalyzed jasmonic acid (JA) to JA-Ile. PgJAR1 is predominantly expressed in leaves and is upregulated by MeJA treatment. Moderate transient overexpression of PgJAR1 promoted the biosynthesis of both JA-Ile and ginsenosides, highlighting the crucial role of PgJAR1 in JA-Ile biosynthesis and its positive impact on ginsenoside accumulation. Nevertheless, elevated JA-Ile levels can impede cellular growth, reducing ginsenoside production. Consequently, balancing JA-Ile biosynthesis through PgJAR1 expression is essential for optimizing ginseng cultivation and enhancing its medicinal properties. Modulating endogenous JA-Ile levels offers a strategy for increasing ginsenoside production in ginseng plants."

      "abstract": "Stable angina pectoris (SAP) is a prevalent manifestation of ischemic heart disease, characterized by chest pain due to myocardial ischemia. Although standard pharmacological treatments such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers are commonly prescribed, their long-term efficacy is often limited by side effects, prompting interest in alternative therapies. Compound Danshen droplet Pills (CDDP), a traditional Chinese medicine formulation comprising Salvia miltiorrhiza, Panax notoginseng, and Borneol, has been widely used in China for its cardiovascular benefits, including improving circulation and alleviating angina symptoms. Despite its clinical use, systematic evaluations of CDDP's efficacy in SAP management are limited. This review summarizes the clinical evidence on CDDP for SAP treatment by analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive search of the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and PubMed databases was conducted, covering studies up to July 31, 2024, using terms such as \"compound Danshen droplet pills\" and \"stable angina pectoris.\" Only peer-reviewed RCTs focusing on CDDP for SAP, published in English or Chinese, were included. After a rigorous screening process by 2 independent authors, with discrepancies resolved by a third, 10 eligible RCTs were selected for review. The results suggest that CDDP may provide significant therapeutic benefits, including anti-ischemic, vasodilatory, and antioxidative effects, with favorable safety profiles in both monotherapy and combination therapy. However, further multicenter RCTs are necessary to validate its long-term efficacy and safety. This review highlights the potential of CDDP as a complementary therapy for SAP and underscores the need for further evidence-based research to optimize its clinical use.",

The interaction between Rg3 and E2F was analyzed using several approaches, including the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), Rg3-PEGA pull-down, Rg3 pull-down protein mass spectrometry, and 3D molecular docking. Additionally, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), co-transfection followed by immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, flow cytometry, Annexin V-FITC staining, Hoechst staining, and luciferase reporter assays were employed to elucidate the molecular effects of Rg3. The inhibitory effect of Rg3 on GC proliferation was assessed through colony formation assays in vitro and tumor xenograft experiments in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. RESULTS: Rg3-mediated gene expression profiling in GC cells revealed several transcription factors, including E2F, and biological processes potentially influenced by Rg3. Consistent with these findings, Rg3 suppressed E2F expression and impeded GC cell proliferation by inducing G1/S cell cycle arrest, reducing cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, enhancing apoptosis, and inhibiting CDC6 transactivation. CETSA and Rg3 pull-down assays confirmed an interaction between Rg3 and E2F. Additionally, 3D molecular docking analysis demonstrated that Rg3 binds with high affinity to E2F at the heterodimeric domain via hydrogen bonding, potentially disrupting E2F-DP heterodimer formation and subsequently inhibiting cell cycle gene expression. In agreement with this, Rg3-treated GC cells exhibited reduced expression of cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin A, CDK1, and CDK2. Moreover, Rg3 activated the tumor suppressors p53 and p21, further inhibiting RB phosphorylation by suppressing cyclin/CDK activity, thereby blocking transcription of G1/S transition-related genes. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence that Rg3 directly binds to E2F proteins, disrupting E2F-DP heterodimer formation and inhibiting the transcription of E2F-DP-regulated target genes. Furthermore, Rg3 activates the p53-p21 pathway while suppressing the cyclin/CDK-RB signaling pathway, effectively inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. These findings highlight a potential therapeutic strategy for developing small molecules structurally similar to Rg3 to target tumors with high E2F expression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginsenosides, the primary active compounds in Panax ginseng C. A. Mey., are well known for their potent immunomodulatory effects. However, their precise mechanisms, particularly concerning the \"intestinal-metabolism-immune axis\", have yet to be fully elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate how ginsenosides protect immune function through the regulation of the gut-metabolism-immune axis. STUDY DESIGN: A CTX-induced immunodeficient mouse model was established to assess the effects of ginsenosides on immune function, gut microbiota, and metabolic pathways. METHODS: The immune organ indices (spleen and thymus), levels of immune cytokines (TNF-Œ±, IFN-Œ≥, IL-6, IL-1Œ≤), and immunoglobulins (IgM, IgA) were assessed. Intestinal microbial diversity was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and metabolomics was employed to identify disruptions in amino acid and lipid metabolic pathways. Spearman correlation analysis and Western blotting were conducted to explore the involvement of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway. RESULTS: Ginsenosides significantly restored immune organ indices and enhanced cytokines and immunoglobulins. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed an increase in probiotic levels and a reduction in potentially harmful bacteria, thereby enhancing intestinal microbiota diversity. Metabolomics analysis showed that ginsenosides ameliorated CTX-induced metabolic disorders and stimulated the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids. Western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-Œ∫B p-p65 expression. CONCLUSION: This study systematically elucidates the mechanism by which ginsenosides enhance immune function by regulating gut microbiota, restoring metabolic balance, and activating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway. These findings provide a molecular foundation for the potential use of ginsenosides in the prevention and treatment of immune-related diseases."

Although Tregs are linked to asthma prognosis through inflammation regulation, no therapeutic agents specifically designed to manage asthma by upregulating Tregs have been developed to date. METHODS: We screened a library of 250 natural products using a cytometric bead array. Among the selected candidates, gRb1 was identified for further investigation. The effects of gRb1 on Treg and Th17 populations were evaluated in mouse asthma models and human PBMCs from both healthy donors and asthma patients using flow cytometry and cytokine analysis. RESULTS: In inflammatory conditions, ginsenoside Rb1 (gRb1, a major ginseng component) increased IL-10- and TGF-Œ≤-expressing Treg populations and decreased the Th17 population; activated phospho-STAT5 and NFAT1 in Tregs; inhibited NFAT1 activation in conventional T cells (Tconvs); increased Treg proliferation and Tconv-Treg differentiation, inhibiting Tconv proliferation; and reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion by Tconvs. In asthma model mice, suppression of asthma symptoms by gRb1 was associated with elevated Treg and lower Th17, Th1, and Th2 counts. gRb1 treatment of stimulated PBMCs from patients with asthma and healthy donors increased IL-10- and TGF-Œ≤-expressing Treg populations and decreased IL-17A-, IL-22-, IFN-Œ≥-, and TNF-Œ±-expressing T-cell populations. CONCLUSIONS: gRb1 alleviate asthma by shifting the Treg-inflammatory T cell balance. These findings suggest a strategy for enhancing Treg activity through treatment with gRb1. This may provide a novel therapeutic approach for asthma and related disorders."

The optimal PHC/PDI ratio of 1:4 was selected for further experiments, achieving 90.8¬†% minocycline removal under visible light after 2¬†h. At the optimal ratio, the visible light photocatalytic performance of PHC/PDI composites under PDS activation was 5.18 and 8.61 times higher than that of PDI and PHC, respectively. The system also exhibited excellent mineralization of minocycline, with a mineralization rate of 73.7¬†%. The PHC/PDI/PDS (P-P-P) system demonstrated good stability under visible light and showed general adaptability to different environmental conditions, including pH, coexisting anions and cations, and real water matrix. Theoretical calculations identified the O5, O7, N9, C20 and C29 sites of Mino-HCl as key targets for free radical attack. Toxicity assessments indicated significant reductions in both acute and chronic toxicity, particularly for fish and algae, indicating the transformation of Mino-HCl into less harmful products. This work provided a theoretical basis and reference for the research on waste management and wastewater treatment by employing lignocellulosic-based waste residues converted into biochar and an organic semiconductor PDI composite under PDS activation for visible light photocatalysis."

At 12.08 mmol/L, spore germination decreased by 43%, while spore yield dropped by 99%. Transcriptomic analysis identified 562 upregulated and 4,095 downregulated genes in the linalool-treated group. The upregulated genes were predominantly enriched in pathways related to metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and carbohydrate metabolism, indicating adaptive stress responses. Downregulated genes were primarily associated with the ribosome biogenesis, transcription, and spliceosome pathways, with ribosome biogenesis showing the most pronounced inhibition. Linalool treatment inactivated TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1), a crucial regulator of ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. This disruption led to reduced expression of ribosome-related genes, severely impairing protein synthesis and fungal growth.

Notably, its primary active components, ginsenosides, exhibit diverse therapeutic effects. Chemotherapy-induced side effects pose significant challenges to the treatment outcomes of cancer patients. Current strategies for managing the adverse effects of chemotherapy exhibit limited efficacy and have the potential to induce various detrimental side effects. In the realm of complications, cardiotoxicity poses a serious threat, ranking as the second major contributor to illness and death in individuals suffering cancer. It is linked to various cellular mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and aberrant myocardial energy metabolism. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that ginsenosides undeniably present non-toxic and efficacious alternatives for addressing chemotherapy-induced side effects, including cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and hematopoietic inhibition. Hence, there is a need to produce novel and potent drugs sourced from natural, non-toxic compounds to address the side effects induced by chemotherapy. The emphasis should be on the underlying mechanisms targeting mentioned cellular pathways. In this comprehensive review, we consolidate current knowledge and summarization with this aim and shed light on the future research of PG in cardio-oncology."

      "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) remains a major clinical challenge, with high amputation and mortality rates. Dysregulated intercellular interactions among vascular, immune, and muscle systems in CLI undermine the body's repair processes. Herein, a multiactive nanomedicine, CDs@Zn@l-Arg, was developed by integrating Panax notoginseng saponin-derived carbon nanodots (CDs-PNS), zinc ions, and l-arginine to induce a mutually supportive cycle of angiogenesis, macrophage reprogramming, and muscle regeneration. CDs-PNS, first identified for their potent antioxidative, angiogenic, and macrophage-reprogramming properties in CLI therapy, are further enhanced by leveraging zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as mediators to physically encapsulate them, while l-arginine is incorporated through electrostatic binding and Schiff base reactions. Individual cell culture experiments demonstrate that, through the integration of various bioactive components, CDs@Zn@l-Arg effectively promotes endothelial tube formation and myosatellite cell proliferation and reduces inflammation and oxidative stress. More importantly, cell coculture models further reveal that CDs@Zn@l-Arg successfully reverses the detrimental intercellular interactions typical of CLI, thereby enhancing the positive crosstalk between endothelial cells, macrophages, and myosatellite cells. In a CLI mouse model, treatment with CDs@Zn@l-Arg significantly improves blood perfusion, reduces inflammation, and accelerates limb function recovery. Altogether, by establishing a regenerative feedback loop among the vascular-immune-muscle system, this multiactive nanomedicine holds promise for overcoming the multifaceted challenges of CLI, providing a breakthrough strategy for integrated therapy.",

However, the related variation of older age accepted as the predictors of poor outcome, in response to Panax notoginseng saponins remains unexplored. METHODS: We conducted a prespecified analysis of the PANDA trial to evaluate the effect of age on the efficacy and safety of Xuesaitong soft capsules. A multivariable logistic and Cox regression analysis with an interaction term was used to determine whether age (< 65 years vs. ‚â•‚Äâ65 years) affected the treatment effect. The primary outcome of this study was functional independence at the 3-month follow-up, as indicated by a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) ranging from 0 to 2. RESULTS: Between July 1‚Äâth, 2018, and June 30 th, 2020, a total of 3072 patients were recruited from 67 medical centers in China. Of these, 2966 patients were incorporated into the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and subsequently categorized into two age-based subgroups: (1) 1788 patients (60.28%) aged less than 65 years and (2) 1178 patients (39.72%) aged 65 years or older. Age significantly influenced the proportion of AIS patients attaining functional independence within three months [aged ‚â•‚Äâ65 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.15, 95% CI: 2.13-4.67, P‚Äâ< 0.0001; aged <‚Äâ65 years, aOR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.33-2.54, P‚Äâ= 0.0002; P for interaction =‚Äâ0.027]. Notably, a significant interaction was detected between age categories and treatment, with a greater likelihood of achieving functional independence among AIS patients aged ‚â•‚Äâ65 years. Regarding the primary safety outcome, which measured the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) at 3¬†months, no significant difference was detected between the treatment and placebo groups across both age categories (aged ‚â•‚Äâ65 years, aOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.06-1.69, P‚Äâ= 0.181; aged <‚Äâ65 years, aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 0.41-7.47, P‚Äâ= 0.444; P for interaction =‚Äâ0.132). CONCLUSIONS: This prespecified secondary analysis suggests that AIS patients can potentially benefit from Xuesaitong treatment in achieving functional independence, irrespective of age. Furthermore, older individuals may experience more substantial clinical benefits from Xuesaitong soft capsules for AIS."

This study aims to explore the potential bioactive ingredients and molecular mechanisms of PN-RS in the treatment of AS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were fed a common diet as the control group. ApoE-/- mice were randomly divided into the model, PN-RS treatment (0.75 mgPN+3.75 mgRS/g/day via gavage), and positive drug groups (rosuvastatin, 1.25 mg/kg/day via gavage). After two months of drugs intervention, H&E and Masson staining, the serum lipid concentration and atherosclerotic index were conducted to verify the PN-RS efficacy. Network pharmacology analysis was carried out to identify the pathways and targets of PN-RS. The signaling pathway-related targets and cytokines were tested via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis identified the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway as a key pathway through which PN-RS exerts its therapeutic effects. Results from animal experiments demonstrated that PN-RS significantly reduced the atherosclerotic lesion area and decreased serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and atherogenic index (AI). Mechanistic studies further revealed that PN-RS inhibited the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway and reduced the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PN-RS could be a promising treatment for atherosclerosis, applicable across diverse populations. Future research should investigate its efficacy in various demographic groups and in combination with other therapies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders significantly impact physical health and quality of life. However, the current treatment strategies have several limitations. Panax ginseng has been traditionally employed to calm the mind, but its active components and their mechanisms remain elusive. PURPOSE: This study aimed to elucidate the sleep-improving actions of Panax ginseng active component, ginseng Rc, and its potential mechanisms. METHODS: Sleep duration and rhythm of Drosophila were assessed via a behavior analysis system. Furthermore, the potential addictive side effects of ginsenoside Rc were assessed through capillary ingestion. Changes in mRNA levels of core clock genes and stress response-related genes were determined via RT-qPCR. In addition, the potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of ginsenoside Rc were evaluated by transcriptomic methodologies. A molecular operating environment (MOE)-Dock simulation was conducted to predict the binding affinity between Pink1 and ginsenoside Rc and verified by surface plasmon resonance. Lastly, Western blotting was carried out to assess Sir2 expression and acetylation of brain proteins. RESULTS: It was observed that ginsenoside Rc improved sleep duration, latency, fragmentation, and amplitude. Furthermore, it upregulated the expression of the clock gene and was not addictive or dependency-inducing. Moreover, it increased antioxidant-related gene expression and reduced stress-related gene expression. In addition, transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that ginsenoside Rc also upregulated autophagy-related genes. Mechanistic studies showed that it improves sleep homeostasis by activating the Pink1/Sir2 signaling pathway, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating protein acetylation levels. CONCLUSION: This study identified ginsenoside Rc, a novel compound from ginseng, and revealed that it can maintain sleep homeostasis. Mechanistically, ginsenoside Rc alleviated oxidative stress by targeting Pink1 and Sir2. These findings provide evidence for the potential clinical application of ginsenoside Rc for treating sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Influenza infections are significantly affected by the genetics of the viruses and the cells they infect. Our previous studies showed that various influenza A subtypes uniquely infect different cell lines, offering insights into viral infection mechanisms. Meanwhile, Korean red ginseng extract (RGE) is known for its anti-influenza properties, attributed to its rich composition of saponin and non-saponin components. PURPOSE: This study evaluates the antiviral effects of RGE and its non-saponin (GNSF) and saponin (GSF) fractions against H1N1 and H9N2 influenza A subtypes in diverse cell lines. STUDY DESIGN: Using various cell types and specialized assays, we explored the effect of pretreatment and continuous treatment with RGE and its fractions on viral infectivity and subsequent cellular responses. METHODS: We treated several cell lines with varying concentrations of RGE, GNSF, and GSF and measured the cytotoxic effect, viral infectivity, oxidative stress levels, immune responses, autophagy activity, and changes in cellular structure. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that RGE and its fractions significantly reduced H9N2 infection levels across multiple cell lines under pretreatment and continuous treatment conditions. However, continuous treatment elicited variable responses to H1N1, with increased infection levels in certain cell lines. Additionally, it elevated the production of reactive oxygen species and altered inflammatory responses, especially in A549 and NCI-H292 cells. GSF also modulated autophagy activity and MUC1 expression in response to H1N1. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the potential of ginseng components as targeted influenza treatment, with cell line-specific responses that could guide treatment approaches.",

Panax notoginseng has anticancer effects on a variety of solid tumors, but data on NSCLC and DDP resistance are lacking.ObjectiveTo investigate the effect of Panax notoginseng on DDP resistance in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo and explore the mechanisms involved.MethodsA 1‚ÄÖg/mL Panax notoginseng extract was prepared to treat the A549 and DDP-resistant A549/DDP cell lines. Cell proliferation was assessed using the CCK-8 assay, and apoptosis was measured via Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry. Glucose uptake, ATP production, and lactate levels were evaluated. Protein levels of p-AKT, GLUT1, HKII, and cleaved-caspase-3 were analyzed by Western blot. IGF1 was used to activate the Akt pathway. In vivo, A549/DDP cells were inoculated into nude mice to establish subcutaneous tumors, and tumor growth and apoptosis were assessed.ResultsPanax notoginseng inhibited A549/DDP cell proliferation, enhanced DDP-induced apoptosis, and reduced glucose uptake, ATP, and lactate levels (all p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Combined treatment decreased p-AKT, GLUT1, and HKII expression while increasing cleaved-caspase-3(p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). IGF1 reversed these effects, indicating Akt pathway involvement (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). In vivo, Panax notoginseng and DDP significantly suppressed tumor growth and increased apoptosis in tumors, confirming enhanced chemosensitivity (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05).ConclusionPanax notoginseng can improve the sensitivity of A549/DDP cells to DDP by inhibiting the effects of TRIM46 and Akt signaling pathways on glycolysis in vivo and in vitro.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Shengmai San (SMS) is a traditional Classic Recipes made with Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon, and Schisandra. The precise mechanism of action of SMS remains unclear, despite its noteworthy therapeutic advantages for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to confirm the mechanism of SMS in the treatment of T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UPLC-MS/MS was employed to identify the active components in SMS. Using network pharmacology, the intervention pathways of SMS in T2DM rats were investigated. A high-sugar, high-fat diet and intrabitoneal injection of streptozotocin were used to create a T2DM rat model. The serum parameters of each group were assessed following the completion of the experiment. The mRNA and protein expression levels of genes related to the PI3K/AKT/GSK3B pathway were analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: There were 39 components found in SMS San by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap/MS. Network pharmacology and molecular docking study indicate that the PI3K/AKT/GSK3B pathway may be a part of SMS's therapeutic mechanism for the treatment of T2DM. Rats' serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, MDA, TNF-Œ±, and IL-6 dramatically dropped after taking SMS, whereas SOD and HDL-C levels rose. The improvement of these parameters may be related to SMS activation of downstream target proteins, PI3K, and AKT. CONCLUSION: SMS can help cure T2DM mellitus by regulating the PI3K/AKT/GSK3B pathway, improving islet tissue injury, reducing oxidative stress, and easing lipid metabolism issues. This study not only revealed the unique therapeutic mechanism of SMS by regulating the PI3K/AKT/GSK3Œ≤ signaling pathway, but also provided new theoretical support for multi-target and personalized treatment of diabetes. Its novelty lies in the first exploration of the mechanism of action of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions through the lens of modern molecular biology, emphasizing the potential of natural medicines in diabetes treatment."

      "abstract": "Bile acid metabolism mediated by gut microbiota is significantly related to immunity regulation that plays an important role in the development and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our previous study has demonstrated that Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) alleviate colitis due to the regulation of T helper 17/Regulatory T cells (Th17/Treg) balance via gut microbiota. However, the effects and mechanism of PNS on colitis pertinent to bile acid metabolism mediated by gut microbiota remain elusive. This study aims to investigate the anti-colitis mechanism of PNS by regulating the Th17/Treg balance pertinent to gut microbiota-bile acid metabolism. Results showed that PNS significantly decreased the relative abundance of Allobaculum, Dubosiella, Muribaculum, and Alistipes, and up-regulated the relative contents of conjugated bile acids, such as TCA and TCDCA. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) showed that the gut microbiota remodeled by PNS had a regulatory effect on bile acid metabolism, and up-regulated the relative contents of TCA and TCDCA, which alleviated IBD and promoted Treg cell expression in¬†vivo and in vitro. Taken together, PNS could reshape the profiling of gut microbiota to generate more TCA and TCDCA, which improve the balance of Th17/Treg to exert anti-IBD effects.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a significant public health issue with high morbidity and mortality. Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) and berberine (BBR), the main bioactive compounds of Panax ginseng and Coptis chinensis, respectively, are known for their hypoglycemic effects. Nevertheless, the synergistic effects and underlying mechanism of Rb1 and BBR on T2DM remain unclear. In this study, we utilized a leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mouse model to investigate the protective effects of their combination treatment. Our findings demonstrated that the combined use of Rb1 and BBR at a 1:4 ratio had more pronounced effects than the first-line anti-diabetic drug metformin on reducing the weight ratio of white adipose tissue, ameliorating insulin resistance, and improving glucose and lipid metabolism. Using spatial transcriptomics, we revealed that metformin treatment improved gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis only in the periportal zone, while the combination treatment induced improvements throughout the liver lobule, with distinct key targets across different zones, thus underscoring a more comprehensive modulation of hepatic metabolism. This may be the key reason why this combination therapy demonstrated superior protective effects against T2DM. Additionally, the reversed expression of the key callback gene hepcidin (HAMP) and its regulator growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) following the combination therapy across all zones, along with validation experiments, further suggested that GDF15/HAMP pathway might be a key mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of Rb1 and BBR against T2DM. This study also indicates a path toward innovative drug cocktails for treating T2DM, offering a holistic approach to regulate the entire liver lobule metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Platinum-based chemotherapy remains a mainstay of clinical practice in the standard treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Most patients who receive this treatment, however, develop relapse and drug resistance. Ginsenoside Rg6 (G-Rg6), one of the anticarcinogenic active components in the American ginseng berry, may hold promise in the adjuvant chemotherapy of EOC. In this study, the correlation between fucosylation and cisplatin (cDDP) resistance in EOC cells was validated by gene expression profile analysis and lectin blot. We found that G-Rg6 derived from the American ginseng berry inhibits the cell viability and protein fucosylation of cDDP-resistant EOC cells. G-Rg6-induced G2/M-cell cycle arrest was proven to result from the autophagy of cDDP-resistant EOC cells. In addition, we observed that G-Rg6 initiates autophagy in cDDP-resistant EOC cells by inhibiting the GRB2-ERK1/2-mTOR axis, and that high concentration of G-Rg6 treatment leads to cell apoptosis. G-Rg6 also enhances cDDP uptake in A2780CP cells by promoting CTR1 expression and suppressing its core fucosylation. Therapies combining cDDP and G-Rg6 display higher efficacy in inhibiting the cDDP-resistant EOC cells in comparison with the sole application of cDDP, exhibiting strong potential for clinical application. G-Rg6 derived from the American ginseng berry can improve cDDP resistance in EOC cells via suppressing fucosylation and inducing autophagy, suggesting its potential in the adjuvant chemotherapy of EOC patients.",

Many natural compounds have been tested as possible cancer treatments. Plants in the genus Panax have been widely studied due to their therapeutic potential for various diseases such as inflammatory disorders and cancers. Extracts from plants of genus Panax activate upstream signals, including those related to autophagy and the generation of reactive oxygen species, to induce intrinsic apoptosis in CRC cells. The root extract of Panax notoginseng (P. notoginseng) regulated the gut microbiota to enhance the T-cell-induced immune response against CRC. Protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides, especially Rh2, Rg3, Rb1, and Rb2, significantly reduced proliferation of CRC cells and tumor size in a xenograft mouse model, as well as targeting programmed death (PD)-1 to block the immune checkpoint of CRC cells. Moreover, modified nanocarriers with ginsenosides upregulated drug efficacy, showing that ginsenosides can also be utilized as drug carriers. An increasing body of studies has demonstrated the potential of the genus Panax in curing CRC. Ginsenosides are promising active compounds in the genus Panax, which can also support the activity of conventional cancer therapies.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xinyin tablets, Chinese patent medicine, are composed of Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. (Araliaceae), Ilex pubescens Hook. & Arn. (Aquifoliaceae), Leonurus japonicus Houtt. (Lamiaceae), Plantago asiatica L. (Plantaginaceae), Ophiopogon japonicus (Thunb.) Ker Gawl. (Asparagaceae), Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, and Draba nemorosa L. (Brassicaceae). It has been used for the prevention and treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) clinically. However, its underlying mechanism of action is far from completely understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to determine whether Xinyin tablets alleviate CHF in SPF C57 mice and to explore the potential mechanism of action in H9c2 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) was performed to identify the chemical compounds in Xinyin tablets. In vivo, 60 C57 mice were randomly divided into 6 groups: the sham group; model group; low-, medium-, and high-dose Xinyin tablets groups; and perindopril group. Animals in the sham group underwent thoracotomy only. The others were subjected to coronary artery ligation. After 4 weeks of drug intervention, the cardiac function of the mice in each group was detected via echocardiography, the myocardial cells were evaluated via HE staining, and the degree of myocardial fibrosis was detected via Masson's trichrome staining. The expression of PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway-related genes (HDAC3, PINK1, Parkin, P62, LC3II/I, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax) was analyzed via RT‚ÄíqPCR and Western blotting. The effects of Xinyin tablets on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mitophagy mediated by the HDAC3 and PINK1/Parkin pathways in CHF model mice were evaluated. In vitro, H9c2 cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia were treated with different concentrations of Xinyin tablets. The mRNA transcription levels of HDAC3, PINK1, Parkin, P62, LC3II/I, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax were measured via fluorescence quantitative PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of PINK1, Parkin, P62, LC3 II/I, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax. TUNEL staining was used to detect the number of apoptotic bodies in the myocardium to evaluate the level of apoptosis. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the number of mitophagosomes. Rapamycin (mitophagy agonist), Mdivi-1 (mitophagy inhibitor), ITSA-1 (HDAC3 agonist) and RGFP966 (HDAC3 inhibitor) were used to create intervention conditions. The effects of rapamycin or Mdivi-1 on PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy were observed. Then, the effects of HDAC3 on the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway, mitophagy and apoptosis in hypoxic cardiomyocytes were observed. Hypoxic cardiomyocytes were treated with Xinyin tablets-containing serum or control serum to observe whether Xinyin tablets could still play a protective role in cardiomyocytes when HDAC3 is activated or mitophagy is inhibited. RESULTS: 785 compounds were characterized from Xinyin tablets, among which carbohydrates and glycosides, phenylpropanoids, terpenes were abundant, and a small number of amino acids, peptides and derivatives also existed in Xinyin tablets. In vivo, Xinyin tablets improved cardiac function (LVEF, LVFS, LVEDD, LVESD, and LVESV) and downregulated the expression of caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax. The expression levels of PINK1 and Parkin subsequently increased. In vitro, the above findings were reinforced in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Rapamycin and RGFP966 reduced the apoptosis of hypoxic H9C2 cardiomyocytes and increased mitophagy mediated by the HDAC3-mediated PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Xinyin tablets have potential as an intervention for CHF by improving mitophagy and inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis through the HDAC3-mediated PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Nanotechnology and nanomaterials have emerged as promising tools for the delivery of anti-tumor drug cisplatin (CDDP). However, concerns exist regarding potential toxicity and cost-effectiveness, limiting their clinical applications. In contrast, plant-derived exosomes (PDEs), as natural nanovesicles, offer significant advantages as drug delivery carriers due to their large-scale production, biocompatibility, and ability to efficiently transport therapeutic drug across cellular barriers. In this work, we established a ginseng-derived exosome (G-Exo)-based CDDP delivery system (G-CDDP) and evaluated its anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that G-CDDP effectively targeted tumor site, inhibiting the proliferation and migration and promoting apoptosis in U-87MG tumor cells. Notably, the amount of CDDP in G-CDDP required for achieving the same cytotoxic effect on tumor cells was 12.66 times lower than that of free CDDP. In U-87MG tumor-bearing mice, G-CDDP effectively targeted tumor sites and exhibited significant therapeutic effect. Collectively, these findings highlight the potent anti-tumor activity of G-CDDP at reduced CDDP dosage, positioning it as a promising and efficient alternative to conventional drug treatments in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is a bioactive compound of Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen (PNS), which possesses desirable properties in bone fracture healing and osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). Whether NGR1 can promote osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) is still unknown. This study aimed to assess the biocompatibility of NGR1 and its impact on DPSCs. METHODS: DPSCs were obtained from human wisdom teeth. Flow cytometry and multilineage differentiation were applied to determine stem cell properties. Then, the cells were treated with NGR1 for 1, 2 and 3 days, and its efficacy was detected by means of a 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Alizarin red staining (ARS), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, quantitative calcium node analysis, western blot and reverse-transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were executed to detect osteogenic differentiation-related proteins and genes. Western blot was also performed to assess the activation levels of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-38 MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK MAPK), and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK MAPK) pathways in DPSCs following treatment with NGR1. RESULTS: DPSCs were positive for CD105 and CD166, while negative for CD34 and CD45. NGR1 at concentrations of 10 and 100 Œºg/mL did not exhibit cytotoxicity (p > 0.05), the group of cells receiving 200 Œºg/mL and 500 Œºg/mL NGR1 exhibited proliferation inhibition on the second day as well as on the third day (p < 0.05). Compared to the control group (no treatment), the cells treated with 100 Œºg/mL NGR1 exhibited significantly higher ALP expression and calcium deposition. The 100 Œºg/mL NGR1 group also showed higher expression of Osterix (OSX), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Collagen Type I (COL-1), and Osteocalcin (OCN) at both protein and gene levels. Western blot analysis revealed that NGR1 activated the MAPK pathway by upregulating p38 and ERK, but not JNK, in DPSCs. When the p38 and ERK signaling pathways were inhibited by SB203580 and U0126, the gene expression levels of OSX, RUNX2, COL-1, and OCN were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), but such alterations were not observed with the inhibition of the JNK pathway. CONCLUSION: At the concentration of 100 Œºg/mL, NGR1 enhances DPSC osteogenic differentiation by regulating the MAPK pathways.",

      "abstract": "Panax quinquefolius L, a medicinal plant of the family Araliaceae, has been used in China for more than 300¬†years. The quality of its medicinal materials is a significant concern. Our previous studies have shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) promote the growth of P. quinquefolius and facilitate the accumulation of the active ingredient ginsenosides. However, these beneficial effects are limited by the low AMF colonization rate in production settings, requiring interventions to improve the colonization rate. Biochar is considered an effective soil amendment. Our preliminary experiments indicate that biochar can enhance the inter-root microecology of P. quinquefolius, as well as increase the AMF colonization rate, but the mechanism was not clear. Therefore, we propose using biochar to increase the AMF colonization rate. In this study, we explore the use of biochar to promote the AMF infestation rate of P. quinquefolius and its potential mechanisms. The mechanism was explored by setting up eight treatments. The colonization rate and intensity of AMF in P. quinquefolius roots were assessed using a Trypan Blue solution. Rhizosphere soil microorganisms were analyzed by 16S and ITS sequencing, and secondary metabolites were identified via non-targeted metabolomics. The results showed that the AMF and 2% biochar combined (AMF‚Äâ+‚ÄâBC2) treatment significantly increased both the colonization rate and colonization intensity of AMF, which were 53.58% and 195.95% higher than that of AMF, respectively. The colonization and rhizosphere AMF data indicate that the application of biochar promotes AMF colonization from outside to inside the root. In addition, biochar attracted potentially beneficial microorganisms such as Sphingobium, Sphingomonas, and Novosphingobium, which are positively correlated with AMF and promote AMF colonization. These microorganisms are closely linked with active secondary metabolites, such as Sphingobium, which is positively correlated with L-malic acid. In conclusion, biochar can improve the quality of P. quinquefolius by promoting the formation of mycorrhizae. This finding provides a theoretical basis for the observed effect of the co-application of biochar and AMF on the growth and active ingredient accumulation of P. quinquefolius.",

Considering the hyperpigmentation treatment challenges (lack of efficacy or aggressiveness), the constant search for new whitening substances is necessary. Given vegetable oils' potential and application in dermatological and cosmetic products, we reviewed the scientific literature on vegetable oils with skin depigmenting activity. It was observed that a variety of species (Adansonia digitata, Arctium lappa, Argania spinosa, Astrocaryum vulgare, Bertholletia excelsa, Borago officinalis, Camellia oleifera, Cucurbita moschata, Euterpe oleraceae, Hevea brasiliensis, Moringa oleifera, Nicotiana tabacum, Oenocarpus bataua, Oenothera biennis, Panax ginseng, Passiflora edulis, Pentaclethra macroloba, Perilla frutescens, Sapindus mukorossi, Taiwanese species Taichung selective No. 4 (TCS4) (Adlay bran), Torreya grandis) were evaluated in vitro regarding their skin whitening properties. All the studies demonstrated that the oils have skin whitening properties and that the oils' activity is related to their composition. The harvesting period, as well as the extraction method, impact on the oils' properties, hence in their activity. The use of vegetable oils can have advantages over an isolated compound as their components can have synergistic or adding effects. When conducting skin whitening experiments, it is recommended to employ multiple assays because vegetable oils can influence skin whitening through various mechanisms. Furthermore, more clinical trials should be encouraged, considering the potential of vegetable oils as skin-lightening ingredients. More innovative and effective formulations can be obtained using vegetable oils for skin whitening purposes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a global health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in conventional therapeutic strategies, the prognosis for HF patients remains challenging, and there is a constant search for novel therapeutic options. Among these, Panax quinquefolius saponin (PQS) has demonstrated promising pharmacological properties that may benefit HF. However, the efficacy and safety of PQS for HF have not been comprehensively evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide a more reliable estimation of the efficacy and safety of PQS for HF. This will help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the potential use of PQS in managing HF patients. METHODS: We comprehensively and systematically searched for published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the following eight electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science (WOS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Data, and China Biology Medicine Database (CBM) from database inception to March 2024. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB 2.0) assessment tool was used for quality assessment, and Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.4) was used for meta-analysis. Mean difference (MD), 95% credible interval (CI), and relative risk (RR) estimates were calculated under a random-effects model. We also used GRADE profiler (GRADEpro, version 3.6) to analyze the quality of outcomes. In addition, the protocol has been registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) under registry number 202440050. RESULTS: This study included nine RCTs involving a total of 952 patients with HF. The results of a meta-analysis under a random-effects model showed that adjuvant PQS therapy significantly increased LVEF (MD = 6.23, 95% CI [4.35, 8.12], P < 0.00001), 6MWTD (MD = 25.26, 95% CI [8.23, 42.30], P = 0.004), and decreased BNP/NT-pro-BNP (MD = -187.94, 95% CI [-267.20, -108.67], P < 0.00001), LVEDV (MD = -22.83, 95% CI [-42.79, -2.87], P = 0.02), LVEDD (MD = -4.76, 95% CI [-5.77, -3.74], P < 0.00001), and LVESV (MD = -11.86, 95% CI [-19.89, -3.83], P = 0.004) in patients with HF. CONCLUSION: The evidence provided by this systematic review suggests that adjunctive PQS therapy for HF can improved clinical efficacy and holds potential advantages in improving cardiac function and increasing exercise tolerance. However, given the limitations inherent in this review, the conclusions of this study should be interpreted cautiously. Therefore, in clinical practice, it is recommended that physicians tailor treatment strategies according to the specific circumstances of individual patients.

      "abstract": "In recent years, numerous researchers have focused on plant extracts derived from traditional medicines to treat stroke, as these extracts may improve patients' cognitive function and quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the effects of nine distinct plant extracts (Ginkgo biloba extract, Ginsenosides, Berberine, St. John's Wort extract, Resveratrol, Gastrodin, Crocus sativus L., Moringa oleifera Seed extract, and Panax Notoginseng Saponins) on cognitive function and quality of life in stroke patients. This study seeks to conduct a network meta-analysis to assess the impact of these plant extracts on cognitive function and quality of life in stroke patients. Researchers systematically searched the Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from database inception through October 2024 searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exclusively(no language restrictions). The selected studies were evaluated for methodological quality via the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool, and data analysis software was used to analyze the data accordingly. The primary outcome measures included the following assessment scales: National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLs), Barthel Index (BI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Treatment effects were ranked based on probability values derived from the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Moreover, cluster analysis was applied to evaluate the effects of plant extracts on six scales that reflect cognitive function and quality of life in patients. After screening, 48 eligible randomized controlled trials were included, covering 6599 stroke patients and evaluating nine different plant extract treatments. Specifically, results from 33 trials were included in the NIHSS score, 10 in the mRS score, 11 in the ADL score, 11 in the BI score, nine in the MMSE score, and eight in the MOCA score. Findings indicate that St. John's Wort extract (SUCRA 71.2%) was the most effective in reducing NIHSS scores, Berberine (SUCRA 84.1%) was most effective in reducing mRS scores, and St. John's Wort extract (SUCRA 99.1%) showed the highest efficacy in enhancing ADL scores. Ginsenosides were the most effective in improving Barthel Index (SUCRA 74.7%), MMSE (SUCRA 93%), and MOCA (SUCRA 79.7%) scores. The NMA indicates that, compared to placebo, St. John's Wort extract, Berberine, and Ginsenosides can enhance cognitive function and improve quality of life in stroke patients. This study provides valuable insights into using plant extracts for stroke treatment, potentially guiding clinical practice, but there are some unavoidable limitations to our study, including heterogeneity, differences in extraction methods of plant extracts, and lack of consideration of social support systems and dose effects. Future longer follow-up, larger samples, and more methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trials are recommended to clearly establish the effects of different dosages on cognitive function and quality of life in stroke patients."

In a previous study, we demonstrated that fresh ginseng exosomes (GEs) alleviated inflammatory bowel disease. However, the precise mechanism by which GEs activate the immune system and subsequently inhibit the formation of intestinal inflammatory microenvironment remains unknown. METHODS: Herein, we investigated the effects of GEs on autophagy, macrophage polarisation, intestinal inflammation, and the epithelial barrier by means of transcriptome sequencing, network pharmacology, transmission electron microscopy, immunoblotting, flow cytometry and small molecule inhibitors. RESULTS: GEs significantly activated autophagy and M2-like macrophage polarisation, which could be blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. In the co-culture system of macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages treated with GEs secreted more interleukin-10 (IL-10) and significantly reduced Nitric oxide (NO) levels in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, GEs acted directly on intestinal epithelial cells through the IKK/I–∫B/NF-–∫B signalling pathway to reduce inflammation and restore the intestinal barrier. Orally administered GEs could restore disrupted colonic barriers, alleviate inflammatory bowel responses, and regulate the polarisation of intestinal macrophages in vivo. CONCLUSION: In summary, GEs may be a potential treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, and targeting autophagy and macrophage polarisation may help alleviate intestinal inflammation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic and challenging condition, necessitates the development of more effective treatments owing to the unsatisfactory efficacy and side effects associated with current medications. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), known for its multi-stage and multi-targeted approach, has a long history in treating gastrointestinal diseases and offering a promising alternative UC treatment. Panax ginseng (P. ginseng), a commonly used remedy for UC in TCM, exemplifies this potential, although the specific components and mechanisms through which its therapeutic effects are exerted remain to be fully elucidated, highlighting the need for further research to unlock its full potential as a treatment option. AIM: To investigate the key constituents and biological pathways through which P. ginseng exerts therapeutic effects on UC. METHODS: Network pharmacology investigated the UC-alleviating mechanism of P. ginseng, including \"active ingredient-target-disease\" network analysis, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses. Panaxadiol (PD; active ingredient of P. ginseng) was tested in a mouse model of 3% dextran sulfate sodium-induced UC, with assessments of body weight, Disease Activity Index scores, and colon length. Colitis and intestinal barrier integrity were analyzed via hematoxylin-eosin and Alcian blue and periodic acid-Schiff staining, immunohistochemistry, real time-quantitative PCR, and western blotting. RESULTS: By integrating and analyzing the targets of P. ginseng and UC, 15 critical hub genes were discovered. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed the mechanisms involved to be linked to MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling. Among the 10 main active ingredients identified as potentially effective, PD was most abundant and was validated in vivo to mitigate weight loss, reduce Disease Activity Index scores, and prevent colon shortening. PD also reduced inflammation and suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators. In addition, PD increased expression of mucin and tight junction proteins. Ultimately, PD counteracted effects of dextran sulfate sodium by inhibiting phosphorylation of NF-–∫B and MAPK, while increasing phosphorylation of AMPK and expression of NRF2 and NQO1. CONCLUSION: PD alleviates colitis and aids intestinal barrier repair, partly via modulation of the MAPK/NF-–∫B and AMPK/NRF2/NQO1 pathways. These findings also suggest new research methods for treatment of UC with TCM.",

PG is renowned for its qi-tonifying properties, while PQ is known for its heat-clearing and fluid-nourishing effects. PJ can eliminate phlegm and relieve cough except for its stasis-dispelling and hemostatic properties like PN. PN, PG, and PQ feature damarane-type saponins, while PJ has a high content of oleic acid-type saponins. In this review, the saponins within the four species were classified and compared, and the unique saponins in PN were identified, such as notoginsenosides Ft1, B, Ab1-3, Fh1-9, etc., which may contribute to its special activities. And their pharmacological effects were also analyzed and summarized, suggesting that notoginsenoside Ft1 may be crucial for vascular homeostasis. However, the effect of unique saponins in PN on blood health should be well-clarified. This review highlights the importance of unique saponins in PN for its overall efficacy and hopes to make further exploration of their potential applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: White adipose tissue (WAT) browning can promote thermogenesis and could be a promising target for treating obesity. Rare ginsenosides transformed from stems and leaves of Panax ginseng (T-GSSL) exhibit numerous biological activities. However, its potential anti-obesity effects and underlying mechanism remain largely unknown. METHODS: Five amino acids were selected as the catalysts for the transformation of ginsenosides into rare ginsenosides. An obese mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks. The effects of T-GSSL on obese mice were assessed by measuring body weight, fat mass, energy expenditure (EE), and glucose tolerance. The 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into mature adipocytes and incubated with T-GSSL. Immunohistochemistry, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), western blotting (WB), real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and other methods were used to investigate the targets and mechanisms of action of T-GSSL. RESULTS: Ginsenosides in GSSL were hydrolyzed using glutamic acid as a catalyst and 12 rare ginsenosides were produced, with a total conversion rate of 95¬†%. T-GSSL ameliorated metabolic disorders, lipid ectopic deposition, and obesity, and maintained glucose homeostasis in obese mice. T-GSSL treatment promoted adipose browning and enhanced EE in both HFD mice and 3T3-L1 cells. These effects were decreased in cells treated with a protein kinase A (PKA) antagonist or subjected to PKAcŒ± knockdown, whereas they were increased in REGŒ≥-/- mice. The inhibition of REGŒ≥ alongside the activation of the PKA/CREB pathway elucidates the mechanism through which T-GSSL reverses obesity by promoting the browning of adipose tissue. CONCLUSIONS: T-GSSL attenuates diet-induced obesity by promoting adipose browning through the inhibition of REGŒ≥ and subsequent activation of the PKA/CREB pathway."

      "abstract": "The influenza virus, especially influenza A (IAV), has remained a constant global health threat due to its high morbidity rate and ability to undergo antigenic shifts and drifts, causing pandemics and epidemics. Due to the rapid evolution of IAV, novel therapeutics are urgently required to combat these viruses effectively, as they develop resistance against current therapeutics. Natural products have been the subject of debate for alternative IAV therapy, where the abundance of bioactive compounds offers numerous potentials for novel anti-IAV drug discovery. Therefore, this review discusses the antiviral effects of natural plant extracts against IAV. Examples are Silybum marianum, Scutellaria baicalensis, Angelica dahurica, Peganum harmala, Sambucus nigra, Echinacea purpurea, Panax ginseng, and Camellia sinensis. Most studies found that Si. marianum inhibits viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis. In contrast, Sc. baicalensis, A. dahurica, Sa. nigra, C. sinensis, and E. purpurea were effective in preventing the entry or binding of IAV into host cells. On the other hand, Sc. baicalensis and Pa. ginseng exert their anti-IAV effect via immunomodulation. Peganum harmala, on the contrary, exhibits a direct virucidal effect against IAV. These studies have shown promising results from using natural products against IAV, which may aid in formulating combinatorial compounds as anti-IAV therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment currently available. The Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. and Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. formula (GSPM) has shown potential neuroprotective effects, but its therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms in AD remain unclear and require further investigation. METHODS: In this study, senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, an AD model, were treated with GSPM (low: 117¬†mg/kg, high: 234¬†mg/kg) or donepezil (1.3¬†mg/kg) via gavage for 2¬†months. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze. Hippocampal morphology was evaluated by H&E staining, and neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were analyzed by Iba1 and GFAP immunohistochemistry. Levels of phosphorylated Tau, AŒ≤1-42, AŒ≤1-40, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers, and senescence markers were measured. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. In vitro, the effects of GSPM were evaluated in AŒ≤1-42-stimulated HT22 hippocampal neurons. Cell viability was assessed via CCK-8, and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The AMPK/Sirt1 pathway was investigated by Western blotting, and SIRT1-dependent effects were evaluated following EX527 treatment, a SIRT1 inhibitor. RESULTS: GSPM treatment improved cognitive function, reduced hippocampal tissue damage, and decreased neuronal apoptosis in AD mice. It alleviated neuroinflammation by reducing microgliosis and astrogliosis and lowered the levels of p-Tau protein and AŒ≤ accumulation in both the hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, GSPM reversed the enhanced inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal senescence observed in AD mice. Furthermore, GSPM modulated gut microbiota composition by reducing microbial diversity and restoring the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio to levels similar to those in control mice. GSPM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus, which was negatively correlated with inflammation, AŒ≤1-42, p-Tau, and senescence markers. It also decreased the abundance of bacteria, such as Oscillibacter, Helicobacter, and Odoribacter, which are associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal senescence. In line with in vivo findings, GSPM increased cell viability, reduced apoptosis, and alleviated oxidative stress in AŒ≤1-42-stimulated HT22 hippocampal neurons. It also decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced expression of senescence markers in vitro. Furthermore, GSPM restored AMPK phosphorylation and Sirt1 expression in neurons. Notably, inhibition of Sirt1 by EX527 reversed the neuroprotective effects of GSPM. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that GSPM exhibits protective effects on AD via suppressing the inflammation, oxidation, and senescence, possibly through regulating the Sirt1 signaling. These findings provided a novel therapeutic approach for AD."

This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic effects and action targets of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on IS and explore a novel pathogenesis and treatment strategy of IS via profiling the microbial community and metabolic characteristics along gut-brain axis. Our findings revealed for the first time that the therapeutic effect of PNS on IS was microbiota-dependent. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) modeling significantly down-regulated Lactobacilli in rats, and PNS markedly recovered Lactobacilli, particularly Lactobacillus reuteri (L.Reu). Metabolomics showed a significant reduction in serum histidine (HIS) in clinical obsolete IS patients and rehabilitation period I/R rats. Meanwhile, the L.Reu colonization in I/R rats exhibited significant neuroprotective activity and greatly increased HIS in serum, gut microbiota, and brain. Moreover, exogenous HIS demonstrated indirect neuroprotective effects through metabolizing to histamine. Notably, vagus nerve severance in I/R rats was performed to investigate HIS's neuroprotective mechanism. The results innovatively revealed that PNS could promote HIS synthesis in gut by enhancing L.Reu proportion, thereby increasing intracerebral HIS through peripheral pathway. Consequently, our data provided novel insights into HIS metabolism mediated by L.Reu in the pathogenesis and treatment of IS."

      "abstract": "Micro-sprinkler irrigation has been a promising irrigation method to promote Panax notoginseng (Burk) F. H. Chen production but their scientific irrigation frequency in improving yield and water use efficiency of P. notoginseng remains contradictory and inconclusive. The objective of this study was therefore to examine and propose a scientific irrigation frequency in water management of P. notoginseng cultivation considering their impact on soil water, soil available nutrients, root growth, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). The micro-sprinkler irrigation experiment under shading and rain-shelter conditions was carried out in the growing season of P. notoginseng from 2017 to 2018.The treatments included four micro-sprinkler irrigation frequencies, such as IF1 (irrigation once every three days), IF2 (irrigation once every five days), IF3 (irrigation once every seven days), and IF4 (irrigation once every nine days) in 2017-2018. The results indicated that the IF3 treatment significantly increased the nitrogen accumulation of P. notoginseng (271.98 mg plant-1). In addition, the IF2 treatment enhanced the phosphorus accumulation (27.82 mg plant-1), potassium accumulation (408.38 mg plant-1), total root surface area (67.49 cm2 plant-1), total root volume (3.79 cm3 plant-1) and yield (702 kg ha-1). The IF2 treatment significantly increased WUE by 29.2%, 28.1%, and 37.7% compared with the IF1, IF3, and IF4 treatments, respectively. Our findings suggested that IF2 treatment increased the soil water content, reduced the soil nutrient content, increased the accumulation of phosphorus and potassium in P. notoginseng, promoted the root growth of P. notoginseng, and improved the quality and yield of P. notoginseng, providing a scientific theoretical basis for reasonable water control and green quality production in the cultivation of P. notoginseng under shade and rain shelter cultivation."

Specifically, the effects of BGE on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells and the growth of solid breast tumors in mice were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antitumor efficacy of BGE was assessed by evaluating its cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, MDA-MB-231 cell xenograft nude mice were treated orally with BGE, and tumor volume, weight, and size, as well as body weight, were analyzed. Liver and spleen weights were measured, and histopathological examinations were performed to assess potential toxic effects of BGE on non-cancerous tissues. RESULTS: In vitro, BGE demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells, even at a minimum concentration of 100 Œºg/ml. In vivo, BGE treatment in MDA-MB-231 xenograft mice significantly reduced tumor weight and size without affecting body weight or tumor volume progression. Additionally, no significant differences in liver and spleen weights or histopathological abnormalities were observed, indicating the non-toxicity of BGE to major organs. CONCLUSION: BGE exhibited promising antitumor activity against breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, with no detectable toxicity to vital organs. These findings highlighted the potential of BGE as an effective and safe therapeutic or preventive agent for breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During¬†medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity. METHODS: A hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed. RESULTS: We found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. The underlying mechanism may be related to the \"intestinal immune -microbiota-metabolic\" pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the precise design and development of GTSs for space-health products.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is a progressive muscle disorder that may lead to mobility disability. No pharmaceutical interventions are currently available, and treatment relies on physical exercise and nutrition. The aim of SARA-INT was to investigate whether BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone), an activator of the MAS receptor, is safe and improves muscle function and physical performance of community dwelling older sarcopenic patients. METHODS: SARA-INT was a randomised three-arm interventional study (BIO101 175‚Äâmg bid /350‚Äâmg bid/placebo) with a planned 6-month treatment (up to 9‚Äâmonths in 50 subjects). Eligibility criteria for sarcopenia were meeting FNIH criteria for sarcopenia and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score ‚â§‚Äâ8/12 in men and women aged ‚â•‚Äâ65‚Äâyears. Primary endpoint was the change from baseline (CFB) in gait speed (GS) measured by 400-m walking test (400MWT), secondary endpoints being CFB in other physical performance tests. RESULTS: A total of 233 participants were randomised (mean age 75.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7.12; 54.3% female), of whom 232 and 156 were included in the full analysis set (FAS) and per-protocol (PP) populations, respectively. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, 55% of on-site end-of-treatment efficacy assessments were lost, reducing the studies' power. In the primary analysis (mix of 6/9‚Äâmonths), BIO101 350‚Äâmg bid treatment after 6/9‚Äâmonths was associated with an improvement in the 400MWT of 0.07‚Äâm/s versus placebo in the FAS population (not significant) and of 0.09‚Äâm/s in the PP population (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008). BIO101 350‚Äâmg bid treatment effect on the 400MWT GS was also observed in pre-defined subpopulations at higher risk of mobility disability (0.0474‚Äâm/s for slow walkers, 0.0521‚Äâm/s for obese and 0.0662‚Äâm/s for chair stand sub-score ‚â§‚Äâ2 from SPPB in the FAS population), with a trend for a dose response. BIO101 showed a good safety profile at both doses (number of subjects with related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of 13 (16.0%), 10 (13.3%) and 10 (13.5%) in the placebo, 175‚Äâmg and 350‚Äâmg BIO101 groups, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: After 6 to 9‚Äâmonths of treatment, BIO101 350‚Äâmg bid showed strong trends consistent with a clinically relevant effect on the 400MWT GS, close to the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in sarcopenia (0.1‚Äâm/s). This was also shown in predefined subpopulations at higher risk of mobility disability. BIO101 showed a good safety profile. Taken together, efficacy and safety data of this Phase 2 trial encourage us to pursue further development of BIO101 for the treatment of sarcopenia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe inflammatory condition characterized by dysregulated immune responses and high mortality rates, with limited effective therapeutic options currently available. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), bioactive compounds derived from Panax notoginseng, have shown promise in mitigating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects remain poorly understood. Given the critical role of M2-like macrophage polarization in resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair, we investigated whether PNS exerts its protective effects in ALI by modulating this process. Furthermore, we explored the specific involvement of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) pathway in mediating these effects. METHODS: Chemical profiling of PNS was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS), followed by quantitative analysis of its major bioactive components via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of PNS and its principal constituents, we established an ALI mouse model through intratracheal administration of LPS. Comprehensive assessments included lung field shadowing, oxygen saturation levels, pulmonary function, and systematic histopathological examination. The regulatory effects of PNS on macrophage polarization were examined in THP-1 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), with cellular phenotypes analyzed by flow cytometry. To elucidate the mechanistic role of STAT6 in PNS-mediated protection, experiments were conducted using Stat6-deficient BMDMs and Stat6 knockout mice. RESULTS: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and HPLC identified and quantified the principal components of PNS: Notoginsenoside R1, Ginsenoside Rg1, Ginsenoside Re, and Ginsenoside Rb1. PNS treatment dose-dependently reduced inflammatory responses in LPS-induced ALI mice, as evidenced by decreased cytokine levels. Each of the four major PNS components independently alleviated ALI symptoms in mice. Pathway analysis revealed 56 potential ALI-related targets, with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment suggesting that PNS exerts its protective effects by modulating inflammatory signaling pathways. In vitro studies demonstrated that PNS promoted STAT6 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, enhancing M2-like macrophage polarization and interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion in a STAT6-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of Stat6 partially reversed the protective effects of PNS on ALI, macrophage polarization, and IL-10 production, confirming the pivotal role of STAT6 in mediating PNS activity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that PNS alleviates LPS-induced ALI by promoting STAT6-dependent M2-like macrophage polarization, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ALI. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the anti-inflammatory actions of PNS and underscore the importance of STAT6 signaling in its protective effects.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Gancao Xiexin decoction (GCXXD), comprising Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Makino, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. , Coptis chinensis Franch. , Ziziphus jujuba Mill. , represents a traditional Chinese medicinal formulation utilized for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Nevertheless, the potential mechanism behind GCXXD treatment for UC is not yet fully elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal system distinguished by intestinal barrier destruction. Previous studies have indicated that excessive ferroptosis activation in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can worsen damage and focal permeability abnormalities in the colon. One of the main mechanisms of ferroptosis is lipid peroxides, which are dependent on long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids. Recent research findings have provided evidence that GCXXD significantly reduces the symptoms of ulcerative colitis (UC) by preserving the intestinal mucosal barrier. So, we aim to demonstrate that the pharmacological mechanism of GCXXD is related to ferroptosis mediated by ACSL4 in this research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, we evaluated the GSE134025 datasets and established an experimental colitis model caused by DSS and treated with a 20¬†mg/kg ACSL4 inhibitor (rosiglitazone). Colon pathological alterations and Alcian blue staining were used to confirm ACSL4 inhibition as a possible therapy for UC. We then examined illness symptoms, intestinal mucosa repair, and ferroptosis markers in UC mice after treated with GCXXD (9,12,15¬†g/kg). Transcriptome study of colon tissues revealed more about the underlying mechanism of GCXXD in the treatment of UC. Finally, we co-administered the ACSL4 upstream agonist with GCXXD in the treatment of UC to show that GCXXD reduced inflammation in UC by modifying ACSL4-induced ferroptosis. RESULTS: Through GSE134025 dataset analysis, we discovered that ACSL4 was substantially expressed in UC patients and that its inhibitors successfully reduced the clinical signs and symptoms of UC colon. Furthermore, we found that GCXXD improved colon length and body weight while increasing the expression of mucin, occuldin, and Claudin-1. It also lowered colon inflammatory cell infiltration and levels of IL-1Œ≤ and TNF-Œ±. In the meantime, GCXXD efficiently decreased ferroptosis-related indicators in colitis mice, such as MDA, Fe2+, COX2, and ACSL4, while also upregulated GPX4 expression. Using KEGG analysis of the genes that were differently expressed between the 3% DSS and GCXXD treatment group, we were able to discover important connections between the hippo signaling pathway, Arachidonic acid metabolism with GCXXD treatment. Due to the fact that TEAD4 functions as an upstream transcription factor for ACSL4, we combined GCXXD and Py-60, a YAP agonist in the treatment of UC. It was worth noting that GCXXD's inhibitory effect of on intestinal mucosa damage and ferroptosis was lessened when the ACSL4 upstream pathway was activated. CONCLUSION: Gancao Xiexin decoction attenuated ferroptosis in UC which might through TEAD4/ACSL4 pathway.",

We further explored their molecular mechanisms, focusing on the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. Inhibition of tyrosinase (TYR) activity and antioxidant activity assays showed that all four active compounds could effectively inhibit TYR activity and enhance antioxidant capacity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the mechanism of action, RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence assays showed that they were involved in the Nrf2/ARE pathway, up-regulating the expression of Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) and Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) mRNAs, while down-regulating Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Overall, these four compounds from P. notoginseng exhibited significant TYR inhibitory and antioxidant effects, ameliorating melasma in mice via the Nrf2/ARE pathway.

METHODS: Mitoxantrone hydrochloride (MH) loaded in acidic Panax notoginseng polysaccharide III nanoparticles (MANPs) was prepared using electrostatic adsorption. This was achieved by loading MH in acidic Panax notoginseng polysaccharide III (APPN III), a natural compound that exhibits anti-tumor activity. Response surface methodology was used to determine the parameters for the best formulation. RESULTS: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry indicated that MH in MANPs was amorphous and exhibited good encapsulation efficiency in the carrier. Findings from dynamic dialysis confirmed that MANPs exhibited slow drug release at pH 6.8 and over the pH range of 7.2-7.4. In vitro experiments confirmed the anti-tumor effects of MANPs on H22 cells based on the inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. MANPs also demonstrated an obvious anti-tumor effect without any toxicity in H22 tumor-bearing mice. This effect could be attributed to APPN III enhancing the immune system and exerting a synergistic anti-tumor effect in combination with MH, thereby alleviating MH-induced damage to the immune system in H22 tumorbearing mice. CONCLUSION: As a nano-carrier prepared using natural resources, APPN III shows immense potential in the field of drug delivery and could serve as a novel option for the effective delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and mechanism of Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng) in treating periodontitis. METHODS: The active components and periodontitis targets were analyzed through network pharmacology and molecular docking. A rat model of periodontitis was established and rats were treated by continuous intragastric administration of Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng) at different doses for 30 d. The alveolar bone structure was observed by micro-CT, the periodontal tissue structure was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, and the related proteins changes was detected by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng) and periodontitis had a total of 96 coincident targets that were significantly enriched in the interleukin 17 (IL-17), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and advanced glycation endproducts and the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts signaling pathways. The active compound quercetin had good binding activity with interleukin 6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNF-Œ±), Jun proto-oncogene (JUN), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) in periodontitis. Compared with normal group, the distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar bone (AB) was increased, alveolar bone absorption was obvious, the periodontal tissue structure was disorganized, and IL-6 and TNF-Œ± were upregulated in periodontitis group; meanwhile, the distance from CEJ to AB was significantly decreased, alveolar bone resorption was reduced, periodontal tissue structure was improved, the expression of IL-6, TNF-Œ±, IL-17 and retinoid-ralated orphan receptor Œ≥t (RORŒ≥t) were decreased, Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) and IL-10 were increased after Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng) treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng) improves the structure of alveolar bone and gum, and reduces inflammation; the mechanism involve in inhibiting IL-17 signaling pathway to suppress Th17 and promote Treg cells differentiation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginsenosides, the principal active ingredients in ginseng, have anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, osteogenic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. Oral diseases afflict about half of the world's population. Ginsenosides' multifunctional properties have led to substantial investigation into their potential to prevent and treat oral disorders. However, their low absorption and poor targeting limit their effectiveness. PURPOSE: This review summarizes the latest research progress on ginsenoside-based drug delivery systems and the potential of ginsenosides in preventing and treating oral diseases to provide a theoretical basis for clinical applications. METHODS: Using \"ginsenoside\", \"drug delivery\", \"nanoparticles\", \"liposomes\", \"hydrogel\", \"oral disease\", \"toxicology\", \"pharmacology\", \"clinical translation\" and combinations of these keywords in PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The search was conducted until December 2024. RESULTS: The limitations of natural ginsenosides can be overcome by utilizing drug delivery systems to improve pharmacological activity, bioavailability and targeting. The multifunctional pharmacological activities of ginsenosides offer promising avenues for treating oral diseases. In addition, the susceptibility of the oral cavity to infection by pathogenic bacteria and the diluting effect of saliva pose significant challenges to treatment. The emergence of drug delivery marks a breakthrough in addressing these issues. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside-based drug delivery methods improve bioactivity, targeting, and reduce costs. This review emphasizes current advancements in ginsenosides within novel drug delivery systems, specifically on its potential in preventing and treating oral disorders. However, multiple well-designed clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs.",

In this study, we fabricated a Carboxymethyl chitosan-Sodium alginate hydrogel loaded with the extract of Astragalus membranaceus-P. notoginseng (APCS), which showed favorable stability, biocompatibility, and the ability to rapidly release drugs. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the APCS hydrogel dramatically increased fibroblast proliferation, migration, and differentiation into myofibroblast. In vivo experiments of wound healing on SD rats showed that APCS hydrogels significantly accelerated skin wound healing, reduced inflammatory response, enhanced the formation of blood vessels, granulation tissues, and collagen fibers, and promoted re-epithelialization at the wound site. Increased expression of catalase, VEGF, and PGP9.5 of wound tissue indicated that APCS hydrogels inhibited oxidative stress and promoted vascular and neuronal regeneration. In summary, the APCS hydrogel displayed great potential as a dressing for achieving satisfactory healing of full-thickness wounds."

This study investigated the anti-proliferative effects and intracellular signaling mechanisms of a gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF) from Panax ginseng in human melanoma cell lines. In vitro, GEF treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, reduced clonogenic potential, and delayed wound healing in melanoma cells. Flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining showed that GEF induced apoptosis, as evidenced by increased apoptotic cell populations and nuclear changes. GEF also caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase for A375 cells and the G2/M phase for A2058 cells. It triggered apoptotic signaling via activation of caspase-3, -9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and downregulation of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). GEF treatment also raised intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial stress, which were mitigated by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an ROS inhibitor. In vivo, GEF suppressed tumor growth in A375- and A2058-xenografted mice without toxicity. These findings suggest that GEF from Panax ginseng has potential antitumor effects in melanoma by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, presenting a promising therapeutic avenue."

However, their combined effects on exercise endurance remain unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effects of ginseng extract and L-carnitine supplementation on exercise endurance in a rat model. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into 10 groups (n = 5 per group): control, ginseng extract (250 and 500 mg/kg/day), L-carnitine (250 and 500 mg/kg/day), and combined treatment. Half of the groups underwent a 16-day exercise training program of swimming without loading. Exercise endurance was assessed using a tail-suspended forced swimming test. Relative organ weight, glycogen content, blood biochemistry, and gene expression were analyzed. Results: Both ginseng extract and L-carnitine supplementation significantly increased exercise endurance, particularly in the exercise group. Ginseng extract and L-carnitine also increased liver glycogen content and upregulated the expression of AMPKŒ±1 and PGC-1Œ± genes in the liver and muscle. In addition, both supplements reduced oxidative stress by decreasing MDA levels and increasing SOD activity. Conclusions: Ginseng extract and L-carnitine supplementation may enhance exercise endurance by improving energy metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and upregulating key genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effects of a novel Astragalus extract (Keyfobell powder [KFB]) composed of Astragalus membranaceus, red ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer), and Cervi Parvum Cornu as a potential growth hormone (GH) alternative. The primary focus was placed on its impact on longitudinal bone growth through the upregulation of circulatory insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. METHODS: We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments using a hypothalamic cell line and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and ghrelin mRNA expressions in GT1-7 cells. The treatment groups were administered KFB at various dosages, and the positive controls received recombinant human GH. Body weight, bone length, and density were assessed, along with serum levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and IGF-1. RESULTS: KFB and somatropin exhibited no cytotoxic effect in GT1-7 cells and increased GHRH and ghrelin mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. KFB administration resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in body weight and bone growth (femur and tibia). Changes in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were comparable to those observed in the GH-treated group. Based on network pharmacological analysis, multiple compounds in KFB ((20S)-20-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one, 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, caproic acid, daidzein, furfuryl alcohol, lauric acid, octanal, and salicylic acid) may synergistically regulate the PI3K-Akt, Ras, and Rap1 signaling pathways linked to growth control and cartilage formation, leading to a possible increase in height. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that KFB can function as a GH-mimetic agent that promotes bone growth through IGF-1 upregulation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a crippling illness with limited effective treatment options. Recent findings have suggested that ginseng stem and leaf saponins (GSLS) possess anti-fatigue effects. However, the detailed mechanisms by which GSLS impact CFS have yet to be fully elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of GSLS in the treatment of peripheral and central fatigue in mice with CFS. METHODS: A CFS model was established in male C57BL/6 mice, which were then subjected to prolonged swimming tests. The validity of this model and the efficacy of GSLS were verified using the forced exhaustion swimming test and the Morris water maze test. The anti-fatigue mechanism of GSLS was verified using pathological section observations, biochemical index tests, neurotransmitter analysis, and Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomics analysis. RESULTS: GSLS prolonged the swim time-to-exhaustion in CFS mice and reduced escape latency in the water maze, revealing their anti-fatigue and memory-improving effects. GSLS significantly protected both peripheral (liver) and central (hippocampus) tissues, as shown in pathological sections. Biochemical indices suggested that GSLS mitigate peripheral fatigue by reducing energy expenditure and oxidative damage and inhibiting the production of harmful metabolites. Furthermore, GSLS altered the abnormal levels of 14 neurotransmitters in the brains of CFS mice, including seven upregulated and seven downregulated neurotransmitters, highlighting their role in mitigating central fatigue through neurotransmitter regulation. Serum metabolomics analysis identified alterations in 19 metabolites across 11 metabolic pathways, thereby elucidating the potential mechanisms by which GSLS treat CFS. CONCLUSION: GSLS ameliorate damage caused by both peripheral and central fatigue. They also act on multiple pathogenic mechanisms by modulating neurotransmitters and serum biomarkers, making them a potential therapeutic agent for CFS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Infertility constitutes a significant global health concern. Cadmium (Cd), a hazardous element, exerts deleterious effects on the reproductive system. Consequently, it is essential to devise novel pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate this adverse effect. Melatonin is linked to the regulation of spermatogenesis across several animals. Ginseng is recognized for its antioxidant capabilities and has shown superior clinical efficacy in male reproductive health. This study aimed to inspect the preventive effects of Melatonin (Mel) and Ginseng (Gin) on the quality of epididymal sperm, as well as testicular function and structure, in rats subjected to cadmium exposure. METHODS: Forty rats were allocated into four equal groups: Control group, Cadmium group: Rats were injected with 2.0‚ÄØmg/kg, Melatonin group: animals were injected with 10‚ÄØmg/kg and Ginseng group: Rats were oral gavage with 100‚ÄØmg/kg. All treatments were maintained for 8 weeks. Testes were taken for histopathological examinations, sperm parameters analysis, biochemical and molecular studies. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant decrease of sperm parameters in Cd group compared to the control group. Nevertheless, treatment with Mel and Gin significantly increased sperm concentration, motility, and viability compared to Cd group (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05). Besides, Cd treatment caused a significant decrease in SOD and CAT activities and an increase in NO and MDA levels which was significantly improved with Mel and Gin administration (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05). Apoptosis, inflammation and autophagy markers were significantly inhibited with Mel and Gin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin and Ginseng reduce testicular toxicity induced by Cd, via inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagy providing novel insights into combating cadmium toxicity.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The traditional Chinese herb Panax ginseng recorded in \"Shennong Herbal Classic\" is renowned for its purported vascular regulatory properties and immune-enhancing capabilities. Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1), a prominent bioactive compound in Panax, has demonstrated significant neuropharmacological activities. However, its impact on multiple sclerosis (MS) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage remains inadequately investigated. AIM OF THE STUDY: Inflammation and BBB disruption are pivotal to MS. Tightly packed brain capillary endothelial cells are fundamental to the structural and functional integrity of the BBB. Rb1 has been shown to alleviate BBB damage in stroke rats, but its effect on BBB damage in MS is not well understood. The objective of this study was to examine the role and mechanism of Rb1 on BBB injury in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BBB protection effect and mechanism of Rb1 were evaluated in LPS-treated bEnd.3¬†cells and EAE model mice. The mRNA expression levels of the inflammatory factor and the protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9), zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), inhibitor of NF-Œ∫B (IŒ∫BŒ±), occludin, Jun-amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) in bEnd.3¬†cells and mouse cerebral cortex were quantified. The permeability of bEnd.3¬†cells was examined by measuring trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and sodium fluorescein (NaF) leakage. RESULTS: Rb1 administration in the early stages of EAE postponed the disease's onset and lessened its severity. Rb1 inhibited the destruction of the BBB in brain cortex of EAE mice. Rb1 reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hyperpermeability of bEnd.3¬†cells and prevented the downregulation of TJ proteins. In addition, in LPS-induced bEnd.3¬†cells, Rb1 decreased the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, Rb1 suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, NF-Œ∫B, and IŒ∫B in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the JNK agonist anisomycin was observed to partially abolish the protective effect of Rb1 in bEnd.3¬†cells treated with LPS. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we demonstrated that Rb1 improved demyelination and BBB damage in EAE mice by modulating JNK/ERK/NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway. This study can offer a theoretical foundation for the use of Rb1 in the treatment of MS/EAE by preventing BBB injury.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The antifungal properties of essential oils (EOs) and their active constituents have been well documented. Histone acetylation is pivotal in modulating gene expression and influences biological processes in living organisms. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that menthone, the primary component of Mentha haplocalyx EO, exhibited notable antifungal activity against Fusarium proliferatum (EC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ6.099‚ÄØmmol/L). The treatment significantly inhibited hyphal growth, reduced spore germination rates from 31.49 to 4.95%, decreased spore viability from 46.88 to 20.91%, and reduced spore production by a factor of 17.92 compared with the control group while simultaneously enhancing cell membrane permeability. However, the direct relationship between menthone and histone acetylation in inhibiting F. proliferatum remains nebulous. Our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identified 7,332 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and menthone-treated groups, 3,442 upregulated and 3,880 downregulated, primarily enriched in pathways related to ribosome biogenesis and energy metabolism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis revealed that menthone inhibited the growth of F. proliferatum by decreasing H3K27ac levels and interfering with the transcription of energy metabolism-related genes. By integrating the RNA-seq data with the ChIP-seq results, we identified 110 DEGs associated with reduced H3K27ac modification primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis. Menthone affected the growth of F. proliferatum by reducing the expression of ribosome biogenesis-related genes (FPRO_06392, FPRO_01260, FPRO_10795, and FPRO_01372). CONCLUSION: This study elucidated the mechanism by which menthone inhibits F. proliferatum growth from a histone acetylation modification perspective, providing insights into its application as an antifungal agent to prevent root rot in Panax notoginseng."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study was to predict and verify the active ingredients of Panax notoginseng-Salvia miltiorrhiza in melasma based on network pharmacology analysis and experimental verification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Panax notoginseng-Salviae miltiorrhizae was investigated by network pharmacology, GEO database analysis, and molecular docking techniques to screen its active ingredients. The active components of Panax notoginseng-Salviae miltiorrhizae were further validated by an in vitro Œ±-melanin-induced B16F10 melanoma cell model and an in vivo UV irradiation combined with a progesterone injection-induced melasma rat model. RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking showed that salvianolic acid B might be the key active ingredient. In vitro cellular experiments revealed that salvianolic acid B inhibits tyrosinase activity in B16F10 cells at concentrations of 60-90 nmol/mL. In vivo animal experiments found that TYR, MDA, and TNF-Œ± were decreased in the skin and serum of rats in the group of the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups of salvianolic acid B, and the expression of GSH-Px and SOD was increased. The high-dose groups of salvianolic acid B showed the best therapeutic effect. CONCLUSION: In this study, experiments collectively show that salvianolic acid B in Panax notoginseng-Salvia miltiorrhiza slows down the process of melasma by inhibiting lipid peroxidation in the organism, increasing the antioxidant capacity of the skin, decreasing the activity of tyrosinase, and providing anti-inflammation. This highlights the successful application of network pharmacology and provides a scientific basis for the clinical citation of Panax notoginseng-Salvia miltiorrhiza in treating melasma."

      "abstract": "Chikusetsu saponin IVa (CHS) is an essential active triterpenoid saponin found in various medicinal herbs, such as Aralia taibaiensis, Panax japonicus, and Aralia elata. While multiple health benefits have been documented, the effect of CHS on aging remains unclear. By employing the D-galactose-induced aging mice and the replicative senescence of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as the aging models, we found that CHS significantly attenuated aging both in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that CHS greatly improved autophagy and mitophagy. Corresponding to the improved mitophagy, CHS remarkably reduced mitochondrial ROS and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function. Mitophagy inhibition and Atg 7 genetic knockout (KO) almost abolished the anti-aging effect of CHS. AMPK pathway was activated during the attenuation of aging by CHS treatment, and a specific AMPK inhibitor reversed the induction of mitophagy and autophagy, as well as the attenuation of aging by CHS. Molecular docking data indicated AMPK as the direct binding target of CHS. In conclusion, our study initially demonstrates that CHS exhibits a potent anti-aging effect both in vitro and in vivo. CHS may directly bind to AMPK and activate the AMPK-dependent pathway to enhance autophagy and mitophagy, thereby reducing mitochondrial ROS and improving mitochondrial respiratory function, contributing to the anti-aging effect. These findings offer a new clue for the promising application of CHS in the improvement of aging and aging-related diseases in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis is a recently identified form of programmed cell death that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes and associated chronic complications, while the occurrence mechanism remains unclear. Ginseng (Panax Ginseng C. A. Mey.) is a valuable traditional medicinal material with proved therapeutic effects on prevention and treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications. Targeting pyroptosis pathway has become a focus of study for ginseng in improvement of diabetes and related chronic complications. PURPOSE: The review aims to elucidate the happening mechanism of pyroptosis in diabetes and diabetic chronic complications, evaluate the effects of ginseng and its active components on diabetes and its chronic complications via pyroptosis-related pathways, and provide a new perspective for the management of diabetes. METHODS: We conducted the literature retrieval with PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases in a systematic manner (up to August 2024). The keywords included pyroptosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, diabetic neuropathy, ginseng, ginseng extract, and ginsenoside. The obtained literatures were comprehensively sorted out. RESULTS: Oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and inflammatory responses were primary contributors to pyroptosis in diabetes and associated chronic complications. In addition, some RNA molecules (miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs) also contributed to pyroptosis under hyperglycemia. The signaling pathways mainly included Nrf2/HO-1, IŒ∫B/NF-Œ∫B/NLRP3, NOX1/NOX4/TXNIP, and P2X7R/TXNIP/NLRP3. Ginseng extracts, some ginsenosides and flavonoid (Quercetin) could exert anti-diabetic effect by regulating pyroptosis-related pathways. We also discussed the toxicity, side effects and clinical applications of ginseng. CONCLUSION: In summary, this review elucidates the happening mechanisms of pyroptosis in diabetes and associated chronic complications, and summarizes published studies about ginseng and its active ingredients in improving diabetes by regulating pyroptosis-related pathways. However, almost all researches are limited to animal and cell experiments, and more clinical trials are required to prove the therapeutic effect of ginseng on diabetes by targeting pyroptosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the escalating use of digital devices, blue light (BL) exposure has emerged as a critical concern due to its potential to cause ocular damage. This study explores the protective effects of notoginsenoside R1 (NR1), a bioactive compound from Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H. Chen (Sanqi), against BL-induced corneal epithelial injury. PURPOSE: This research aims to investigate the protective effects of NR1 on BL-induced corneal injury and wound healing delay. METHODS: Human corneal epithelial cells (hCECs) were pretreated with NR1 (0-50 ŒºM) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 mM), then exposed to BL (570 ŒºW/cm¬≤) for 24 h. Cell viability, proliferation, migration, and ROS levels were assessed using various techniques. In mice, NR1 (25 ŒºM and 50 ŒºM) and NAC (0.3 %) eye drops were administered during BL exposure. Corneal injury, healing rates, cell proliferation, migration, ROS, and inflammation were evaluated. RNA-sequencing, bioinformatics, and molecular binding validation identified tribbles homolog 1 (TRIB1) as a key molecule mitigating BL damage with NR1. Functional studies via gene silencing, overexpression, and pharmacological modulation further explored TRIB1's role in BL exposure. RESULTS: NR1 significantly reduced BL-induced inflammation, ROS production, and inhibited migration and proliferation in hCECs and murine corneas. It also alleviated BL-induced corneal injury and delayed healing in mice. NR1 inhibited TRIB1 upregulation, a marker of BL-induced injury and healing delay. Overexpression of TRIB1 negated NR1's therapeutic effects on hCECs, while TRIB1 silencing mitigated functional impairment. In mice, increased Trib1 expression caused corneal injury and delayed healing, reversed by NR1 treatment. CONCLUSION: NR1 shows potential as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting TRIB1 elevation in response to BL exposure, providing a novel promising target for corneal injury and wound healing delay induced by BL, and offering a comprehensive strategy for clinical pharmacological intervention.",

Among these, the endophytic fungus SQ3, identified as Chaetomium globosum, was capable of reducing silver ions to form metallic silver nanoparticles. The green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) presented a distinct surface plasmon resonance peak at 424¬†nm, with particle sizes between 2.92 and 31.34¬†nm, indicating strong antioxidant activity. In vitro assessments demonstrated that AgNPs exhibited significant antifungal activity against Phytophthora infestans, Botrytis cinerea, and Helminthosporium maydis. AgNPs produced inhibition zones measuring 17.5¬†mm, 15.2¬†mm, and 13.4¬†mm against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. When applied to cherry tomatoes, AgNP treatment effectively inhibited the growth of Botrytis cinerea, minimized weight loss, preserved fruit firmness and soluble solids content, slowed the reduction in titratable acidity, and prolonged storage life. Additionally, AgNPs suppressed the increase in malondialdehyde content and maintained increased superoxide dismutase activity. These findings highlight the potential of green biosynthetic silver nanoparticles as biological control agents, providing promising resources for developing innovative treatments against postharvest fungal infections in crops.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy frequently experience cardiotoxic side effects that significantly affect their prognosis and survival rates. Our study found that Panax ginseng root extract exerted a significant protective effect against cisplatin-induced myocardial cell injury. PURPOSE: The present study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which the bioactive components of Panax ginseng mitigate cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity (CIC). METHODS: In vitro, the candidate active components were screened by network pharmacological prediction and in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), and their mechanisms of action were verified by transcriptome sequencing, western blotting, gene overexpression, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and cellular thermal shift assays. A C57BL/6 CIC mouse model was established to verify the protective effects of the candidate components and the in vivo mechanism of the candidate components. RESULTS: Through network pharmacology prediction and cellular activity screening of ginseng root compounds, ginsenoside Rh2(S) (Rh2) was identified as a significant active component. Transcriptomic, in vitro, and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Rh2 can activate the Pak1/Limk1/cofilin phosphorylation pathway, thereby inactivating the actin-severing protein cofilin and protecting cardiomyocytes from cisplatin-induced actin depolymerization. Additionally, Rh2 suppressed the ROS/caspase-3/GSDME pathway to inhibit cisplatin-induced pyroptosis. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation and overexpression experiments confirmed that Rh2 activated the FGFR1/HRAS axis, thereby simultaneously regulating the two aforementioned pathways to combat CIC. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated for the first time that Rh2 is the main active component in Panax ginseng that maintains cytoskeletal homeostasis and inhibits pyroptosis by regulating the FGFR1/HRAS pathway to resist CIC. This study aimed to provide a theoretical basis for expanding the targets and pathways of CIC treatment, and for the development of related drugs.",

The concept of \"synthetic lethality\" in cancer clinics has emerged, particularly with the use of PARP inhibitors and the identification of DNA damage response (DDR) mutation biomarkers, emphasizing the significance of targeting DDR in cancer therapy. Novel approaches aimed at genome maintenance machinery are under development to further enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments. Natural compounds from traditional medicine, renowned for their anti-aging and anticarcinogenic properties, have garnered attention. Ginseng-derived compounds, in particular, exhibit anti-carcinogenic effects by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting cells from DNA damage-induced carcinogenesis. However, the anticancer therapeutic effect of ginseng compounds has also been demonstrated by inducing DNA damage and blocking DDR. This review concentrates on the biphasic effects of ginseng compounds on DNA mutations-both inhibiting mutation accumulation and impairing DNA repair. Additionally, it explores other natural compounds targeting DDR directly, providing potential insights into enhancing cancer therapy efficacy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effects of ginseng non-edible callus-derived extracellular vesicle (GNEV) on skin regeneration, particularly focusing on its impact on proliferation and migration in human dermal fibroblast (HDF). METHODS: GNEV was isolated from ginseng non-edible callus using sequential filtration and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The extracellular vesicle was characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). HDF was treated with various concentrations of GNEV, and cell viability, proliferation, and migration were assessed using MTT and scratch wound healing assays. Gene expression related to collagen synthesis (TGF-Œ≤, SMAD-2, SMAD-3, COL1A1) was measured using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Treatment of HDF with GNEV resulted in a significant 2.5-fold increase in cell migration compared to the non-treated group. Furthermore, GNEV demonstrated the upregulation of collagen synthesis genes, specifically TGF-Œ≤, SMAD-2, SMAD-3, and COL1A1, by 41.7¬†%, 59.4¬†%, 60.2¬†%, and 21.8¬†%, respectively. These findings indicated that GNEV activates the TGF-Œ≤/SMAD signaling pathway, showcasing its potential to induce skin regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, GNEV exhibits a notable ability to enhance skin regeneration through its stimulatory effects on cell migration and the upregulation of key collagen synthesis genes. The activation of the TGF-Œ≤/SMAD signaling pathway further suggests the potential of GNEV as a promising candidate for drug delivery systems in the fields of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, opening avenues for further research and application in skincare and dermatology."

However, the efficacy of the AR-NR medicine pair (AN) in improving cardiac remodeling and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate AN's cardioprotective effect and potential mechanism on cardiac remodeling using transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and fibroblasts in vitro. High-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) characterized 23 main components of AN. AN significantly improved cardiac function in the TAC-induced mice. Furthermore, AN considerably reduced the serum levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin T (CTn-T), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and mitigated inflammatory cell infiltration. Post-AN treatment, TAC-induced heart size approached normal. AN decreased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and attenuated the upregulation of cardiac hypertrophy marker genes (ANP, BNP, and MYH7) in vivo and in vitro. Concurrently, AN alleviated collagen deposition in TAC-induced mice. AN also reduced the expression of fibrosis-related indicators (COL1A1 and COL3A1) and inhibited the activation of the transforming growth factor-Œ≤1 (TGF-Œ≤1)/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) pathway. Thus, AN improved TAC-induced cardiac remodeling. Moreover, AN downregulated p-dynamin-related protein (Drp1) (Ser616) expression and upregulated mitogen 2 (MFN-2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) expression in vivo and in vitro, thereby restoring mitochondrial fusion and fission balance. In conclusion, AN improves cardiac remodeling by regulating mitochondrial dynamic balance, providing experimental data for the rational application of Chinese medicine prescriptions with AN as the main component in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Ginsenosides are the most important secondary metabolites of ginseng. Ginseng has developed certain insect resistance properties during the course of evolutionary environmental adaptation. However, the mechanism underlying the insect resistance of ginseng is poorly understood. To elucidate the insect resistance mechanism of ginseng, we performed stress experiments on ginseng inoculated with black chafer larvae. The contents of ginsenosides in the ginseng roots, stems and leaves were determined at 0, 72, 120 and 168 h after the inoculation of insects. The tandem-mass-tag technology was used to determine the protein phosphorylation sites. Plant hormones were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring targeted metabolomics. The results showed that ginsenosides present in the stems and leaves were more responsive to insect herbivory treatment than those present in the roots. Through proteomics, we found that the expression of most of the differentially expressed proteins, including GAPC1, GAPC2, and CSD1, was downregulated by insect herbivory treatment, HSP81-3 expression was up-regulated under insect herbivory stress. Regarding plant hormones, abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid, Typhasterol (TY), iopentene adenine (IP), Cytokinin Riboside (czR) and Thiamethasone (tZ) levels were increased by herbivory treatment. With the increase in herbivory treatment time, the levels of trans-Zeatin-riboside (tzR), Isopentenyl adenosine riboside (iPR), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were increased after 168h. The levels of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonates (JA), cis-PODA, and JA-Ile were increased after 120h but decreased thereafter. Under stress conditions, the expression of many antioxidant-related proteins was down-regulated; however, HSP81-3 expression was up-regulated, indicating that the plants exhibited severe oxidative stress. In conclusion, HSP81-3 plays an important role in ABA-dependent regulations involved in response to insect herbivory stress in ginseng. GAPC1 and GAPC2 also participate in the process of anti-herbivory stress response in ginseng.",

A high-glucose/high-fat diet in conjunction with streptozotocin administration was employed to establish type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rat models, and their fecal FAs were detected using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. RGAP treatment alleviated the polyphagia, polydipsia, weight loss, and hyperglycemia observed in T2DM rats. FA profile was disturbed by T2DM modeling, and 11 marker FAs were selected from statistical analysis, whose intensities were reversely changed by RGAP administration. Among these marker FAs, short-chain FAs were negatively correlated with the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, while positive correlations were observed between long-chain FA and the FBG level. Combined with the metabolite-enzyme-gene network analysis, we inferred that the mechanistic mechanism RGAP on T2DM may be associated with the regulation of FA metabolism and inflammation-related signaling pathways. This study confirmed the regulatory effect of RGAP on fecal FA, which can provide a scientific basis and new ideas for developing red ginseng as a functional food for supplementary treatment of T2DM.",

Importantly, in vitro experiments with hypoxia/reoxygenation cell models corroborated these findings, showing that PNS inhibited pyroptosis and regulated the ROCK2/NF-Œ∫B pathway.

HAD-B1 is composed of 4 natural drugs, Panax Notoginseng Radix, Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, Cordyceps militaris, and Boswellia carterii Birdwood, and has been reported to have therapeutic effects on patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in several studies. Resistance to gefitinib in HCC827 cells was acquired through MET activity. Co-treatment with osimertinib and HAD-B1 reduced the cell viability of HCC827-GR cells. In addition, phosphorylation of MET and ERK were effectively suppressed for HCC827-GR cells. And, compared to when osimertinib and HAD-B1 were administered alone, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and apoptosis was effectively induced when osimertinib and HAD-B1 were co-administered to HCC827-GR cells. We found that the synergistic effect of osimertinib and HAD-B1 combination therapy resulted in cancer cell death and cell cycle arrest by targeting the ERK and mTOR signaling pathways. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the combination of osimertinib, a third-generation anticancer drug, and HAD-B1, a natural anticancer drug, had a potentially synergistic effect on non-small cell lung cancer resistant to EGFR-targeted anticancer drugs.",

Chemotherapy currently dominates as the primary option of treatment. However, its severe adverse effects, limited efficacy, and resistance to drugs undermine its potential. Growing evidence suggests that ginsenoside Rg3, a natural compound obtained from the ginseng plant (Panax ginseng), holds significant promise in cancer therapy. Its proposed mechanisms primarily involve the enhancement of immunity, retardation of cancer cellular proliferation and metastasis, triggering apoptosis, angiogenesis, epigenetic modification, and Regulation of transition of epithelial mesenchyma (EMT) and miRNAs/lncRNA. Furthermore, Rg3-ginsenoside potentiates the effectiveness of conventional treatments of cancer and reduces the adverse effects through synergistic interactions. Ginsenoside Rg3's present status in cancer research is thoroughly reviewed in this article, shedding light on its intricate mechanisms and potential to revolutionize cancer therapy through combinatorial and nano-based targeted therapy."

METHODS: In¬†vivo¬†models were¬†developed¬†using¬†db/db¬†mice,¬†while¬†in vitro models¬†utilized¬†HK-2¬†cells¬†exposed¬†to high glucose and palmitic acid (HGPA). Online databases and Cytoscape software were¬†employed¬†to predict the potential¬†targets¬†of NR2. The expression of associated proteins was measured using immunohistochemistry and western blot. Lipid accumulation, oxidative stress¬†levels, mitochondrial¬†function and cell apoptosis were also¬†assessed.¬†Small¬†interfering RNA was used in in vitro¬†experiments¬†to examine the effect of¬†c-Src. RESULTS: NR2 ameliorated albuminuria, renal function and renal pathology in db/db¬†mice. The activation of c-Src was suppressed in db/db mice and in HK-2 cells exposed to HGPA. NR2 inhibited JNK/STAT1 phosphorylation and CD36 overexpression. NR2 also ameliorated lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. By¬†inhibiting¬†c-Src,¬†HK-2 cells exposed to HGPA experienced less¬†lipid deposition and mitochondrial¬†damage,¬†indicating the renoprotective effects of NR2 were correlated with the inhibition of c-Src. CONCLUSION: NR2 ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction and delayed the progression of DN partly through suppression of c-Src. The protective effects of NR2 might be related to a reduction in lipid accumulation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F. H. Chen (PN) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been applied to prevent and treat osteoporosis. The mechanism of PN for osteoporosis remained a mystery. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to reveal the therapeutic effect and illuminate the possible mechanism of PN for osteoporosis. METHODS: The Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform was searched to screen the potent ingredients of the PN and to analyze the potential therapeutic targets for osteoporosis. We excavated four disease databases to collect osteoporosis-related genes. After integrating the gene expression profile of osteoporosis and the chemical-protein data of PN, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to demonstrate the interactions among the gene products. GO function, KEGG pathway, and docking analyses were executed. RESULTS: Network pharmacology obtained 31 active ingredients and 134 targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. The key components were beta-elemene, quercetin, methyl palmitate, oleic acid, and hexanal. The results of GO and KEGG analyses showed that Panax notoginseng was beneficial for osteoporosis by influencing the main pathways including AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway, modulating inflammation, metabolism, cell proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis. Panax notoginseng intervened in osteoporosis through multi-components, multi-targets, and multi-pathways. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the mechanism of Panax notoginseng for osteoporosis, providing broader insights for novel research and developments of the Panax species for osteoporosis."

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with no universally recognized effective treatments currently available. In recent years, ginseng and its principal active components, such as ginsenosides, have shown potential protective effects in the treatment of these liver diseases. In NAFLD, studies have demonstrated that ginseng can improve hepatic lipid metabolism, reduce inflammatory responses, and inhibit oxidative stress and fibrosis, thereby attenuating the progression of NAFLD. Additionally, ginseng inhibits oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities, and it can impede fibrosis by interfering with the fibrotic signaling pathways. These combined effects contribute to attenuating the progression of NAFLD. These findings highlight the promise of ginseng as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NAFLD. However, despite the significant efficacy of ginseng in human NAFLD treatment, the number and quality of clinical studies remain limited, with a lack of large-scale, multicenter clinical trials to confirm these effects. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of different ginsenosides, optimal therapeutic dosages, and the safety of long-term use require further investigation. This review summarizes the existing evidence on the mechanisms of action of ginseng and its active components in human NAFLD, assesses their potential as therapeutic options, and proposes future research directions to provide stronger scientific support for clinical application. Additionally, we performed a network pharmacology analysis of ginseng in relation to NAFLD to identify and investigate potential targets of ginseng in the treatment of NAFLD. This analysis aims to provide a theoretical foundation for the development of ginseng -based drugs for combating NAFLD.",

PURPOSE: This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of GSC for AS by identifying the active components of GSC. METHODS: The chemical composition of GSC was analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS. The network pharmacology method combined with TCMSP and GeneCards database was used to identify potential targets and enriched pathways related to AS treatment. Use AutoDock for molecular docking to evaluate the binding affinity of active ingredients to core targets. Finally, the LPS-induced A549 cell inflammation model was used to evaluate the effect of GSC on the release of inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: The main components in GSC, including ginsenosides (Rf, Rd, Rg2, Ro, Rg5, Rh1) and lignans (schisandrin A, B, schisandrol A, B, schisandrin ester A) were identified. Network analysis revealed 139 intersection targets and highlighted STAT3, TNF, EGFR, IL1B, and AKT1 as key targets, with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as the main pathway. Experimental results showed that GSC significantly reduced the levels of IL-1Œ≤, IL-6 and TNF-Œ± in LPS-induced A549 cells (p¬†<¬†0.01), indicating its powerful anti-inflammatory effect. CONCLUSION: GSC plays a role in treating asthma by targeting STAT3, TNF, IL-1Œ≤ and AKT1, regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines.

PURPOSE: This study explores the therapeutic targets and pathways of Sini Decoction plus Ginseng Soup (SNRS) in ALF using bioinformatics and network pharmacology, focusing on its impact on macrophage polarization through glucose metabolism reprogramming. The efficacy of SNRS was validated in an LPS/D-GalN-induced ALF model, and its optimal concentration was determined for in vitro macrophage intervention. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HBV-induced and acetaminophen-induced ALF were identified from GEO datasets. The correlation between target gene expression and immune cell infiltration in ALF liver tissue was analyzed. AST, ALT, TNF-Œ±, HMGB1, IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were measured, and liver histopathology was assessed. Macrophage polarization was analyzed via immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and Western blot. Glycolysis-related enzymes and metabolites, including HK2, PFK-1, PKM2, and LDHA, were quantified. Cellular ultrastructure was examined by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Five key glycolysis-regulating genes (HK2, CDK1, SOD1, VEGFA, GOT1) were identified, with significant involvement in the HIF-1 signaling pathway. Immune infiltration was markedly higher in ALF liver tissue. SNRS improved survival, reduced ALT/AST levels, alleviated liver injury, and modulated macrophage polarization by decreasing CD86 and increasing CD163 expression. In vitro, SNRS inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine release, lactate production, p-mTOR/mTOR ratio, and HIF-1Œ± expression. CONCLUSION: SNRS modulates macrophage polarization and glucose metabolism reprogramming via the mTOR/HIF-1Œ± pathway, showing promise as a treatment for ALF.",

      "abstract": "Natural plant-derived polysaccharides exhibit substantial potential for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) owing to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and favorable safety profiles. However, their practical application faces several challenges, including structural instability in gastric acid, imprecise targeting of inflamed regions, and limited intestinal retention times. To address these limitations, pH-responsive, colon-targeting microspheres (pWGPAC MSs) are developed for delivering phosphorylated wild ginseng polysaccharides (pWGP) to alleviate UC. These pWGPAC MSs are fabricated by incorporating pWGP into calcium-crosslinked alginate microspheres with subsequent chitosan surface modification to enhance mucosal adhesion. These pWGPAC MSs demonstrated exceptional stability under acidic conditions while enabling targeted release in the colon. In a mouse model of UC, the pWGPAC MSs effectively mitigated mucosal injury, attenuated inflammation, and restored intestinal barrier function. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that these pWGPAC MSs modulated the TLR4/MYD88 signaling pathway and promoted M2 macrophage polarization. Integrated microbiome and metabolome analyses demonstrated that these pWGPAC MSs regulated the gut microbiota composition and decreased pro-inflammatory metabolite levels. In addition, these microspheres demonstrated promising safety profiles. Collectively, these findings establish pWGPAC MSs as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of UC and provide a solid foundation for future clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "The roots of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (ginseng) are one of the traditional medicinal herbs in Asian countries and is known as the \"king of all herbs\". The most important active components of ginseng are the secondary metabolite saponins, which are closely related to ecological stress. Unsuitable ecological stress can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), by which the secondary metabolism is regulated, and the quality of herbs can be significantly improved. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment on the quality of fresh ginseng roots. In this study, 5-year-old fresh ginseng was exposed to 0.1, 0.5, and 2 mmol/L SNP, a nitric oxide (NO) donor for five consecutive days. SNP significantly increased the levels of O2¬∑-, H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA), NADPH oxidase (NOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxides (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), ascorbate (AsA) and GSH/GSSG. The main root treated by 0.5 mmol/L SNP for three days was the best, with the activities of the key enzymes of the ginsenoside synthesis pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPS), squalene synthase (SS), squalene epoxidase (SE), and dammarane diol-II synthase (DS) activities increased markedly; the ginsenosides Rg1‚Äâ+‚ÄâRe, Rb1, Rf, Rc, Rg2‚Äâ+‚ÄâRh1 and the total ginsenoside contents increased by 51.0%, 77.7%, 44.6%, 26.8%, 63.2% and 48.2%, respectively, but only a trace amount of the ginsenoside monomer Rb2 decreased 23.4%. The fibrous roots treated by 0.1 mmol/L SNP for four days showed the best effect, HMGCR, FPS, SS, SE, and DS also increased significantly; ginsenosides Rg1‚Äâ+‚ÄâRe, Rb1, Ro, Rc, Rf, Rb3, Rb2, and total saponin contents increased 37.6%, 47.8%, 34.2%, 75.1%, 51.0%, 49.4%, 28.3%, and 20.4%, respectively. The 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-DPG) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), related to primary metabolism, were also significantly elevated. The Morris water maze (MWM), histopathological analysis and oxidative stress indexes in brain tissues were used to evaluate the anti-aging effect, indicating that the SNP-treated ginseng further ameliorated D-gal-induced the impaired memory function and oxidative stress in mice, implying the efficacy of SNP-treated ginseng was better than untreated ginseng's. SNP can build the physiological state of ginseng under ecological stress, stimulate the antioxidant protection mechanism, increase the secondary metabolites, and improve the quality of ginseng.",

This bibliometric study analyzes the recent research status of these three TMs, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), traditional Korean medicine (TKM), and Kampo medicine (KM). METHODS: Research topics of studies published for recent 10 years (2014 to 2023), through a search on MEDLINE via PubMed, was analyzed. Medical Subject Headings were used to distinguish between the three TMs researches. Bibliographic information was analyzed through VOSViewer version. Total 10,151 documents were included: TCM studies (n=9,630); TKM studies (n=256); and KM studies (n=295). RESULTS: Comparing the three co-occurrence analysis maps, TCM studies generally overwhelm the quantitative scale of TKM and KM studies. In the trend of the latest research of TCM, not only corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but also clinical research topics such as gastrointestinal microbiome and diabetes mellitus have emerged, with in silico research approaches being actively applied. In the case of TKM, obesity and cooperative treatment with Western medicine are gaining attention. In KM, COVID-19 and Scutellaria baicalensis were recent research focuses. Unique features that distinguished from the other two TM research trends included 'gut microbiota', 'diabetes mellitus', 'clinical trials', 'disease models', and 'quality control' in the TCM map; 'prospective studies', 'cell line, tumor', and 'panax' in the TKM map; and 'aged, 80 and over', 'retrospective studies', 'glycyrrhiza', 'panax', and 'paeonia' in the KM map. Also, some quantitative and qualitative differences were found in author co-operation maps in each TM. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis revealed that there were clear quantitative and qualitative differences among TCM, TKM, and KM. Although these medicines have a common root, they may have become distinct due to factors such as the size of research funds, cultural differences, and the medical licensing system.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is a systemic metabolic disease caused by insulin resistance and malfunctioning pancreatic Œ≤-cells. Although ginseng (the roots of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) can be used to treat T2DM, the underlying mechanism is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the role and mechanism of, Œ≥-aminobutyric acid-fructosyl-glucose (GABAFG), a maillard reaction product of ginseng, in T2DM treatment. METHODS: The metabolism of GABAFG in serum and tissues was analyzed via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Q exactive-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QE-MS). The molecular mechanisms of GABAFG in pancreatic Œ≤-cells (in vivo and in vitro) were investigated via Western blotting, qPCR and immunofluorescence. In addition, the results were validated via high-throughput sequencing and serum metabolomics. RESULTS: GABAFG alleviated the elevation of blood glucose and blood lipids in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice. Also, GABAFG reduced the insulin resistance-associated IRS-1 signaling axis in pancreatic Œ≤-cells in vitro. Mechanistically, GABAFG targeted the nuclear translocation of TFEB inhibited apoptosis of pancreatic Œ≤-cells by enhancing autophagolysosome function. In addition, GABAFG remodeled the gut microbiota. Specifically, GABAFG increased Akkermansia, decreased Romboutsia abundance, and decreased serum glycerophospholipid metabolism, thus alleviating T2DM-induced dyslipidemia. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess the pharmacological effects of ginseng-derived GABAFG in T2DM. Therefore, this study provides a new theoretical basis for understanding ginseng effect in metabolic diseases."

AIM OF THE STUDY: This review highlighted the close link and bidirectional effects between P. notoginseng and gut microbiota, with the ultimate aim of providing new insights into the potential mechanisms of pharmacological effects of P. notoginseng in the treatment of different diseases and PNS transformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By means of some reputable databases (PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Google Scholar, etc.), we screened the published articles related to P. notoginseng from 1998 to 2024, including original research, clinical trials and review on raw materials and chemical constituents of P. notoginseng. Then, we employed the keywords \"gut microbiota\", \"intestinal microbiota\", \"gut biotransformation\" and \"intestinal\" to exclude the articles that do not in line with our topic. Plant information was obtained from www.worldfloraonline.org using \"Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H.Chen\" as the keyword. RESULTS: P. notoginseng elevated certain probiotics including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia, while simultaneously reducing pathogenic bacteria such as Prevotellaceae, Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Helicobacter, to fight various diseases. Meanwhile, considering to the low oral bioavailability and degradable properties of Panax notoginseng saponin (PNS), gut microbiota converted it into protopanaxatriol(PPT) and protopanaxadiol(PPD) mainly through deglycosylation reactions to enhance the bioactivity. CONCLUSION: Increasing evidences suggest that gut microbiota may play a vital role for P. notoginseng exerting on beneficial effects on the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders, liver diseases, neurological diseases, chronic kidney diseases, vascular diseases, colitis, and other diseases, as well as for biotransformation of P. notoginseng.",

      "abstract": "Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a common form of BC in dogs. Adjuvant chemotherapy administration is commonly applied in MIBC cases, but patients sometimes experience treatment failure and recurrence. Therefore, supplements with anticancer properties, such as traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), are required, and they have been widely used in Japanese human medicine and may be useful in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, organoid cultures can mimic the characteristics of their original tissues, such as self-renewal and organization. We previously established a novel experimental model for MIBC using a dog BC organoid (DBCO) culture. Herein, we examined the antiproliferative effects and mechanisms of 39 substances, consisting of TCMs, TCM supplements, and crude drug extracts, on DBCOs. Among the TCMs, D3 (also known as Shibe-ria), which is a mixture of chaga (Inonotus obliquus) and notoginseng (Panax notoginseng), significantly diminished the cell viability of DBCOs. The expression of BC stem cell markers, CD44 and SOX2, was reduced considerably in the D3-treated DBCOs. Among the components of D3, chaga exerted an antiproliferative effect on DBCO, whereas notoginseng did not. The administration of D3 also significantly reduced the volume of DBCO xenografted tumors in mice in vivo. Overall, D3 may have benefits as a natural anticancer supplement in veterinary medicine.",

      "abstract": "Diverse liver diseases are characterised by late diagnosis and rapid progression and have become one of the major threats to human health. To delay the transition from benign tissue lesions to a substantial organ injury, scientists have gradually applied natural compounds derived from plants as a complementary therapy in the field of hepatology. Ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) is a tonic traditional Chinese herbal medicine, and natural products, including ginsenoside Rg1 (G-Rg1), which is a kind of 20(S)-protopanaxatriol saponin with a relatively high biological activity, can be isolated from the roots or stems of ginseng. Given these information, this review aimed to summarise and discuss the metabolic mechanisms of G-Rg1 in the regulation of diverse liver diseases and the measures to improve its bioavailability. As a kind of monomer in Chinese medicine with multitarget pharmacological effects, G-Rg1 can provide significant therapeutic benefits in the alleviation of alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, liver fibrosis, viral hepatitis, etc., which mainly rely on the inhibition of apoptosis, strengthening endogenous anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms, activation of immune responses and regulation of efflux transport signals, to improve pathological changes in the liver caused by lipid deposition, inflammation, oxidative stress, accumulation of hepatotoxic product, etc. However, the poor bioavailability of G-Rg1 must be overcome to improve its clinical application value. In summary, focusing on the hepatoprotective benefits of G-Rg1 will provide new insights into the development of natural Chinese medicine resources and their pharmaceutical products to target the treatment of liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "Cholinergic deficiency and neuroinflammation are the two main factors of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that water-soluble ginseng oligosaccharides (WGOS) derived from Panax ginseng roots can protect against scopolamine-induced impairments in learning and memory. However, the fundamental mechanisms remain unclear for the most part. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of WGOS on cholinergic function and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of mice. Mice were first pretreated with WGOS or saline, and then treated with scopolamine to establish an Alzheimer's disease model. The cognition memory of the mice was assessed through the behavioral test. The effect of WGOS on the cholinergic system was evaluated by measuring acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter concentration and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus. Using ELISA, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1Œ≤ and TNF-Œ± in the hippocampus were identified. This study found that WGOS treatment prevented the scopolamine-induced impairment of mice's recognition memory, as seen by their enhanced object recognition. In addition, WGOS prevented the scopolamine-induced decrease in ACh concentration and increase in AChE activity. Moreover, WGOS treatment inhibited scopolamine-induced upregulation of the inflammatory proteins IL-1Œ≤ and TNF-Œ±. These findings suggest that the amelioration of scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice by WGOS was a consequence of the control of cholinergic function and inflammatory response in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that WGOS should be investigated as a dietary supplement or medication for the treatment of learning and memory disorders in humans."

Niraparib is a widely used targeted therapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. As a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, niraparib significantly improves progression-free and overall survival in patients. We aimed to explore the potential effect of red ginseng (RG) on niraparib-induced myelosuppression and to further reveal its possible molecular mechanism. Female C57BL/6 mice were divided into control, tumor, model, and RG groups (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ6). After receiving ID8 ovarian cancer cell inoculation, the mice received niraparib treatment (80 mg/kg) for 3 days. Meanwhile, RG groups (100 and 200 mg/kg) were intragastrically treated with RG extract for 7 days. Compared with the model group, RG extract increased the counts of peripheral blood cells and enhanced the hematopoietic function of bone marrow. Furthermore, RG extract increased the colony yield of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), facilitated DNA damage repair, alleviated the G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and significantly reversed the increased expression levels of p53, p21, and p27, while stimulating cyclinE1 expression levels. These findings indicate that RG might have therapeutic potential on niraparib-induced myelosuppression, which encourages further clinical trials. This study is the first to explore the efficacy and mechanism of RG in preventing myelosuppression induced by niraparib.",

Several studies have suggested that ginsenoside Rg3 may help reduce hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby slowing the progression of liver fibrosis. Ginsenoside Rg3 may have some therapeutic effects on liver fibrosis, and the underlying molecular mechanisms behind these effects are attributed to cellular autophagy, apoptosis, and anti-inflammation, as well as the modulation of antioxidant activity and multiple signaling pathways.

However, few studies have been conducted on osthole in agriculture, and its effects on plant growth have little been reported. METHODS: Three experimental treatments were set up in this experiment: blank control (CK), osthole (CLS), and B. amyloliquefaciens (LKWS). In this study, the effects of osthole and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens on the growth parameters, photosynthesis, antioxidant enzyme activities, disease incidence, and microbiome of forested P. quinquefolius were tested. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that the use of osthole and B. amyloliquefaciens significantly improved the growth of Panax quinquefolius in a forest compared to that in the control treatment, increased the total chlorophyll and carotenoid content of P. quinquefolius, significantly increased its net photosynthetic rate, and decreased the stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 levels. In addition, the use of osthole and B. amyloliquefaciens significantly improved ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase (POD) activities, enhanced antioxidant activities of the P. quinquefolius POD, and reduced the disease incidence and index of American ginseng anthracnose. Based on the American ginseng microbiome analysis, the use of osthole and B. amyloliquefaciens could change the structure of the American ginseng microbial community, significantly increase the diversity of American ginseng bacteria, significantly decrease the diversity of American ginseng fungi, stimulate the recruitment of more growth-promoting microorganisms to American ginseng, and build a more stable microbial network in American ginseng. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, we found that the application of osthole had a positive effect on the growth of American ginseng, providing a theoretical basis for its subsequent application in agriculture."

Furthermore, STR administration reduced the expression of various epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins including N-cadherin, vimentin, and [Formula: see text]-catenin. By employing a systems biology approach, 21 common genes were identified across RNA-seq data, TCGA-HCC dataset, and network pharmacology analysis. Finally, of these genes nine were found to be associated with both OS and PFS in patients with HCC within the TCGA cohort. Validation of candidate genes by qPCR and WB identified a significant downregulation in the expression of pGSK3[Formula: see text] and RELA protein with increasing concentrations of STR.¬†These results elucidated the mechanism by which STR inhibits tumor growth and EMT of HCC may be related to the GSK3[Formula: see text]/RELA pathway.",

Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) have been widely used in the clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases, demonstrating excellent efficacy, and can potentially improve angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium. However, the effects of PNS on angiogenesis and its underlying mechanism of action remain unclear. PURPOSE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of PNS in improving angiogenesis after myocardial infarction (MI) and explain the mechanism of PNS in improving angiogenesis in CAD from an epigenetic perspective. STUDY DESIGN: The MI rat model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery permanently. The in vitro model comprised hypoxic human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCEACs). The mice and cells were then treated with PNS. METHODS: Blood tests, histomorphology, polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and MassARRAY targeted methylation detection analyses were conducted in vivo and in vitro to investigate the potential mechanisms of PNS. RESULTS: Oral PNS significantly improved myocardial injury and activated angiogenesis in MI rats. DNA methylation analysis in vitro revealed that PNS decreased the hypermethylation of microRNA 200a (miR200a). PNS improved angiogenesis in hypoxic human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCEACs) by regulating the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. CONCLUSION: Our research shows that PNS can improve angiogenesis in rats with MI and hypoxic HCEACs and affect the level of miR200a promoter methylation and miR200a and VEGF molecular pathways.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is a significant concern in cancer treatment, as certain chemotherapeutic agents can have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. This can lead to a range of cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, pericardial complications, and vascular toxicity. Strategies to mitigate chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity may include the use of cardioprotective agents (e.g., dexrazoxane), dose adjustments, alternative treatment regimens, and the implementation of preventive measures, such as lifestyle modifications and the management of cardiovascular risk factors. Ginsenosides, the active compounds found in ginseng (Panax ginseng), have been studied for their potential cardioprotective effects in the context of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. In this review, we investigate the cardioprotective effect of ginsenosides in chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Ginsenosides have been shown to possess potent antioxidant properties, which can help mitigate the oxidative stress and inflammation associated with chemotherapy-induced cardiac injury. They can modulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes and reduce the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby protecting cardiomyocytes from damage. Ginsenosides can also inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death) of cardiomyocytes, which is a key mechanism underlying chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Modulation of ion channels, improvement of lipid profiles, anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic effects, and promotion of angiogenesis and neovascularization are another important mechanisms behind potential effects of ginsenosides on cardiovascular health. Ginsenosides can improve various parameters of cardiac function, such as ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and cardiac output, in animal models of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. The cardioprotective effects of ginsenosides have been observed in preclinical studies using various chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. However, more clinical studies are needed to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of ginsenosides in preventing and managing chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in cancer patients.",
