      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Efficacy trials show that evidence-based injury prevention training reduces injuries in youth athletes but effectiveness, that is, outside the controlled setting, is lower and, consequently this training has had limited public health impact. Insufficient involvement of end-users at the individual and organisational levels is identified as a main barrier to successful implementation. The 'Implementing injury Prevention training ROutines in TEams and Clubs in youth Team handball (I-PROTECT)' uses an ecological participatory design incorporating the perspectives of multiple stakeholders throughout the project. Within the I-PROTECT research project, the specific aim of this study is to investigate the implementation of the end-user-targeted I-PROTECT programme. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pragmatic two-armed cluster randomised controlled trial is conducted collaboratively with the Swedish Handball Federation that has overall responsibility for handball in Sweden. Randomly selected clubs in Sweden offering handball for both female and male youth players are invited to participate. 18 clubs are randomised (stratified by club size) to intervention (I-PROTECT plus tailored implementation support) or control (injury prevention programme currently available through the Swedish Handball Federation). The anticipated total number of potential participants (players, coaches, club administrators, parents/guardians) is ~3500. The I-PROTECT programme includes end-user-targeted information and physical and psychological injury prevention training available in a specifically developed interactive mobile application. Implementation strategies were selected from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change discrete implementation strategy compilation, based on feedback from end-users. Implementation outcomes will be investigated at the end of the handball season using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance implementation evaluation framework. A study-specific questionnaire, app downloads and/or workshops will be used to collect data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Swedish Ethical Review Authority approved the study. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific journals, as popular science articles, at international conferences and communicated via the Swedish Handball Federation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05696119."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The last phases of a competitive game are when shoulder injuries most commonly happen, and fatigue is thought to be a major contributing factor, perhaps because of reduced proprioception and motor control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of concentric fatigue on proprioception, motor control, and performance of the upper limb in handball players. METHODS: Forty-six right-handed handball players (all males, age 26.1 ± 5.54 years) were included in this test-retest laboratory experiment. Proprioception was assessed using joint reposition sense (JRS), threshold to detection of passive movement (TTDPM), muscle onset latency (MOL), motor control using Y balance test upper quarter (YBT-UQ) and performance using the athletic shoulder test (ASH) before and immediately after fatigue intervention. The fatigue protocol consisted of concentric, maximal effort, isokinetic contractions at 900/sec with sets of 30 repetitions of the shoulder external and internal rotator muscles. Fatigue was determined by a 40% decline in the peak torque over three consecutive contractions despite reinforcing feedback and encouragement. RESULTS: A significant increase in absolute angular error (AAE) was observed in all target angles in both external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR) directions (p < 0.01). In addition, there was a significant increase in TTDPM in internal rotation after fatigue intervention (p = 0.020. Variable changes were found in YBT-UQ and ASH tests. Specifically, statistically significant differences were found in anteromedial (AM) (p = 0.041), superolateral (SL) reach directions (p = 0.005), composite score (p = 0.009) in the right hand and inferolateral (IL) reach direction in the left hand (p = 0.020) in the YBT-UQ. In addition, there was a significant reduction in isometric strength (ASH test) in the I position of the right hand (p = 0.010) and all positions of the left hand (p<0.05). Furthermore, there was an increase in MOL scores after fatigue but the increase was not significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Concentric fatigue of the rotator cuff muscles induces notable deficits in joint position awareness, kinesthesia, motor control, and performance of the upper extremity in elite male handball players. Although fatigue reduces reflex reaction time the effect is only marginal.",

INTRODUCTION: Regarding sports performance, different strategies have been used displaying different outcomes. In a more holistic approach, the use of manual therapies such as acupuncture has gained increased attention. METHODS: A convenience sample of 27 handball players divided into three distinct groups was used for analysis (Sham = 22.3 ± 3.77; Acupuncture = 23.6 ± 5.27; Control = 25.25 ± 5.50 years old). Participants were assessed for lower limb power (countermovement jump), handgrip strength, and maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) \"pre\" and \"post\" an acupuncture, control or Sham protocol. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding vertical jump performance. A significant reduction on MIVC was observed for the \"Sham\" group in the intraprotocol analysis for both dominant and non-dominant limbs (0.047). It was also found a significant reduction on handgrip strength in the intraprotocol comparison of both \"Sham\" (p = 0.028) and \"acupuncture\" (p = 0.015) groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an acute systemic acupuncture protocol provided a minor negative impact on handgrip strength performance in a sample composed of male handball players.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This paper aims to investigate the impact of proprioceptive exercises on postural control in handball players with chronic ankle instability. METHODS: The research participants (n = 22) were divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 11) and the control group (n = 11). Chronic ankle instability was diagnosed using the Identification of Functional Ankle Instability (IdFAI) questionnaire, while postural control was evaluated with the Iso-Shift stabilometric platform. The intervention consisted of a 15-week proprioceptive exercise program, with sessions performed three times a week. The rehabilitation protocol was conducted at the start of each training session, immediately following the warm-up. RESULTS: The data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests. Both groups improved their score on the Identification of Functional Ankle Instability (IdFAI) questionnaire (IdFAI_CG, p < 0.011; IdFAI_EG, p < 0.003) and reduced the number of ankle sprains (NS_EG, p < 0.008). Also, the experimental group had better results for the following tests: ellipse area with open eyes on the left leg (EA_I-OE_L, p < 0.009), ellipse area with closed eyes on the left leg (EA_I-CE_L, p < 0.033), anteroposterior deviation with open eyes on the left leg (APD_I-OE_L, p < 0.023), and the initial and final number of ankle sprains (NS_I, p < 0.01; NS_F, p < 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Athletes who suffer from chronic joint instability are more likely to experience severe postural deviations than those who do not have this condition. Proprioceptive exercises had a positive impact on postural control in both groups, but the experimental group showed a greater improvement."

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to record shoulder and trunk stability of elite female handball players and to investigate their effect on throwing velocity and accuracy. 151 female handball players (9 teams in total) from the Hungarian first league participated in a mid-season conditional survey. The study included tests of trunk and shoulder stability, and measurements of factors affecting shoulder stability, as well as throwing speed and throwing accuracy. After the conditional survey, 18 players were selected for the intervention group (IG) and 18 players for the control group (CG). Significant relationships were found between the medial stability of the shoulder joint (Y-balance) and throwing accuracy (upper right corner) (r = 0.766; p < 0.001), throwing accuracy (upper left corner) (r = 0.729; p < 0.001), total throwing accuracy (r = 0.907; p < 0.001). The IG showed significant improvement in trunk stability (p < 0.001), shoulder joint stability (p < 0.001), throwing velocity (p < 0.001), and throwing accuracy (p = 0.002), compared to the CG. These findings support the idea that trunk and shoulder stability are related to throwing performance of female handball players. Measuring and training these aforementioned factors, particularly medial shoulder stability, may be a valuable adjunct to improving throwing accuracy and throwing velocity."

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 679 highest-division Danish handball players aged 14-18. Players self-reported past-year shoulder, knee and ankle injuries at baseline, and weekly information on any handball-related injuries (irrespective of time loss and medical attention), illnesses, exposure hours and injury management over 31 weeks. RESULTS: At baseline, 46% (95% CI 42% to 49%) of the players reported a past-year shoulder, knee or ankle injury. The weekly average injury and illness prevalence was 21% (95% CI 19% to 23%) and 2% (95% CI 1.7% to 2.3%), respectively, and the ir was 9.4 (95% CI 8.7 to 10.2)/1000 hours. Females experienced the highest injury burden from knee injuries (ir: 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.2) × 6.7 (95% CI 4.7 to 8.7) weeks with injury/1000 hours), while males experienced the highest injury burden from shoulder injuries (ir: 1.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.7) × 5.7 (95% CI 3.6 to 7.8) weeks with injury/1000 hours). Health professionals were consulted in 58% (95% CI 54% to 62%) of injuries, players independently made the return to sport decision in 44% (95% CI 37% to 51%) of injury recurrences, and used analgesics, mainly (91% (95% CI 85% to 95%)) sourced from home, in 24% (95% CI 21% to 28%) of injuries. CONCLUSION: Almost half of highest-division adolescent Danish handball players reported a previous past-year shoulder, knee or ankle injury. Any time during the season, 21% reported an injury and 2% an illness. The highest injury burdens were from knee injuries in females and shoulder injuries in males. Health professionals often managed injuries, but players frequently made return to sport decisions independently and commonly used analgesics sourced from home.",

A randomized controlled trial was conducted, with participants randomly assigned to either the investigated group (N = 29) receiving a single session of FM or the control group (N = 27) receiving no treatment. The ROM for IR and HADD were measured before, immediately after, and one month after the FM session. The investigated group experienced a statistically significant acute increase in glenohumeral IR (14 degrees, p < 0.001) and HADD (14 degrees, p < 0.001) compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The positive effects of FM persisted one month post-treatment, with increased IR ROM by 12 degrees (p < 0.001) and HADD ROM by 11 degrees (p < 0.001). Participants in the investigated group reported lower subjective tightness/stiffness immediately after (p < 0.001) and one month after treatment (p = 0.002) compared to the control group. This study demonstrates that a single application of FM effectively improves glenohumeral ROM in the dominant throwing shoulder of asymptomatic handball players. It highlights the immediate and sustained positive effects of FM on IR and HADD. These findings support the use of FM as an effective method for enhancing shoulder ROM and reducing subjective tightness/stiffness. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06009367)."

A systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 38(11): e695-e705, 2024-This review aimed to assess the effects of exercise training on handball players' performance. A thorough search was conducted in 5 online databases (ProQuest, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost (SPORTDiscus), as well as on Google Scholar and other gray literature references starting on April 11, 2022. The methodological quality of the included research was evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. This systematic review includes 16 studies. Eight studies received \"excellent\" ratings (≥6 points), 5 received \"good\" ratings (5 points), and 3 received \"moderate\" ratings (4 points). The findings showed that the most frequently examined performance factors in exercise training intervention strategies with handball players were balance ( n = 5), agility ( n = 8), speed ( n = 9), and jumping performance ( n = 10). Muscular strength ( n = 4), shooting and dribbling skill ( n = 3), and muscular endurance ( n = 4) were the second most frequently investigated performance factors. Regarding speed and agility, exercise training considerably improved the physical fitness of handball players. However, evidence related to muscular strength, shooting ability, and dribbling skills was limited. To achieve the optimum standard, handball players must have strong physical and physiological qualities. Meanwhile, no evidence was found related to the impacts of exercise training on power, endurance, flexibility, body composition, cardiovascular fitness, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Regarding limitations, there is a need for more research with solid evidence to determine the impacts of exercise training interventions on athletes' performance in handball.",

      "abstract": "Handball is a body-contact Olympic ball sport that is characterized by fast-paced defensive and offensive actions. Players must coordinate explosive movements (e.g. changing of direction) and handball-specific skills (e.g. passing). Maximizing performance requires a systematic approach to training that includes physical, psychological, technical, and tactical preparation. Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the effects of movement-based (MOV; unspecific sport stimulus) or game-based (GAM; sport-specific stimulus) flywheel resistance training intervention in highly trained youth handball players. Method:Twenty-five highly trained youth male handball players completed two sessions per week of flywheel resistance training (MOV, n = 12; GAM, n = 13) over the 7-week intervention period. Change-of-direction tests (180º change-of-direction speed test of both legs and test) and handball-throwing test were conducted before and after the intervention. Results: Both groups significantly improved V-cut, and 180º Change-of-direction speed test performance (p < .05; d = 0.79-2.05). Notwithstanding, the GAM group demonstrated greater improvements in V-cut and COD180ASY compared with the MOV group (p < .05) with small effect. Handball throwing speed performance remained unchanged independently of training condition (p > .05). Conclusions: These findings provide further support for the training principle of \"specificity\" and highlight the importance of including a game-based training stimulus during resistance training. This is a key consideration for coaches wanting to enhance physical performance in youth handball players.",

Participants aged 16.0 ± 0.5 years were randomly assigned to control (CNT, n = 12), standard elastic band (SEB, n = 12), or contrast elastic band (CEB, n = 12) programmes, each performed twice a week supplementing the regular training. The sprint (10 m and 20 m), modified Illinois change-of-direction test (COD), squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), standing long jump (SLJ), back extensor strength (BES), medicine ball throw (MBT), 1-RM bench press, 1-RM half squat, repeated sprint ability, and force-velocity (F-V) tests were measured before and after the intervention. Both CEB and SEB similarly improved sprint (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01) and COD (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01) when compared to CNT. Jumping performance improved significantly (SJ p < 0.01; CMJ p < 0.05) only in CEB, compared to CNT. Strength improved in both experimental groups (p < 0.01; ES: 0.73 < d < 1.59) compared to CNT, and there was a greater increase for CEB than SEB (p < 0.05) in the medicine ball throw (Table 3). Both CEB and SEB increased all RSA scores compared to CNT (p < 0.01; ES: 0.10 < d < 1.22), without significant difference between them. All F-V scores increased significantly in CEB and SEB compared to CNT (p < 0.01; ES: 0.45 < d < 2.47). In addition, CEB showed substantial gains in performance for PPabs, PPrel, and F0 (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively) compared to SEB. Ten-week elastic band training conducted within the competitive season improved limb strength, power and F-V profile in female handball players, with a superior effect of the contrast elastic band training mode for upper-limb strength and F-V characteristics."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Overhead sports overload the shoulder complex due to movement repetition and the great amount of force created during the athletic motion, which may cause adaptations in the shoulder and lead to shoulder pain. However, overhead movements include the kinetic chain, and alterations in some of the structures throughout the kinetic chain may increase stress on the shoulder complex and be associated with shoulder pain. PURPOSE: To compare kinetic chain components in overhead athletes with and without shoulder pain. METHODS: Forty-one volleyball and handball athletes (21 with and 20 without shoulder pain) were included and assessed for hip internal (IR) and external rotation (ER) range of motion (ROM), hip and trunk isometric strength, trunk endurance and neuromuscular control of the lower and upper limbs (Y balance test). RESULTS: Athletes with shoulder pain showed smaller IR ROM in both hips, lower endurance time for trunk extensors and flexors, decreased reach distance in the anterior and posteromedial direction, as well as a smaller composite score in the Y balance test (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Volleyball and handball athletes with shoulder pain showed changes in ROM throughout the kinetic chain in addition to lower core endurance, and decreased neuromuscular control of lower limbs.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Zinc (Zn) deficiency has been described not only on general human health but also within the sports context -as negatively affecting performance-. Thus, Zn status assessment is of great interest for athletes, especially in order to correct deficiency states of this mineral. OBJECTIVE: The overall objective of this work was to assess Zn status in professional handball players during the competitive period (through plasma levels, dietary intake and gene expression of the Zn transporters), as well as to determine the effect of Zn supplementation. METHODS: A total of twenty-two participants were recruited, -twelve belonged to the Control Group (CG) and ten male handball players comprised the experimental group (ATH-G)-, being monitored over a 2-month period with 2 evaluation moments: baseline (i.e., initial conditions) and follow-up (i.e., after 8 weeks of training and competition). Zn intake, plasma Zn levels, and gene expression of Zn transporters were obtained. RESULTS: Plasma Zn levels were higher in ATH-G than in CG at the end of Zn intervention (p ≤ 0.010). Moreover, differences in the gene expression profile of Zn transporters were observed in ATH-G -with the down-regulation of several Zn transporters-, compared to the CG at baseline (p ≤ 0.05). Likewise, differences in the Zn transporters expression were observed in ATH-G at 8 weeks (all, p ≤ 0.001) -with ZnT2, ZnT5, ZIP3, ZIP5, ZIP11, ZIP13 and ZIP14 transporters being up-regulated-. CONCLUSION: Handball players seemed to have different nutritional needs for Zn, with differences in the gene expression of Zn transporters compared to controls. Zn intervention in our athletes may have influenced the expression of Zn transporters, indicating a potential increase in Zn transporters expression to mobilize Zn at the cellular level at 8 weeks of Zn intervention.",

Youth athletes (15.8 ± 0.2 years) were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 16) or a control group (n = 14). The intervention group performed contrast rubber band training (20 sessions over two weeks), while the control group maintained regular in-season training. The modified T-test, squat jump, countermovement jump, standing long jump, repeated sprint ability, 1-RM bench press and half squat, along with upper and lower limb force-velocity tests were performed. The intervention group experienced significantly larger performance enhancements than the control group in the modified T-test [p < 0.001; d = 1.45%Δ (intervention = -7.1, control = -0.8)], vertical jump [p ≤ 0.009; d ≥ 0.72; %Δ (8.4 < intervention < 19.8, 4.1 < control < 12.2)], 1-RM strength [p ≤ 0.04, d ≥ 0.80; %Δ (37.1 < intervention < 39.7, 7.2 < control < 11.2)], all force-velocity scores for the upper limbs [p ≤ 0.009; d ≥ 0.72; %Δ (21 < intervention < 82, 0.1 < control < 11.6)], three of four force-velocity scores for the lower limb performance [p ≤ 0.02; d ≥ 0.64; %Δ (6.4 < intervention < 31.3, 0.8 < control < 11.1)] and all repeated sprint times [p < 0.001; d ≥ 1.15; %Δ (-3.4 < intervention < -3.1, -1.9 < control < -0.5)]. It was concluded that ten weeks of contrast rubber band training positively affected most motor abilities in youth female handball athletes. Therefore, coaches and practitioners should consider utilizing contrast rubber band strength training as a time and resource-efficient means of improving physical fitness of youth handball players."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Throwing is one of the most important movement in handball. Throwing performance is crucial for success in handball. OBJECTIVE: Τo investigate the level of evidence for the effect of resistance training (RT) on throwing performance in handball players. METHODS: Systematic searches of Pubmed, Medline complete, Cinahl, Sport Discus and Scopus were undertaken for peer reviewed articles published between 18 March 1995 to 18 March 2023. Randomized, controlled, clinical studies, written in English, aiming to investigate the effect at least one modality of RT on throwing performance (velocity or/and accuracy) in handball players were considered for inclusion in the study. The eligible studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Physical Therapy Evidence Database (PEDRO) scale. The Best Evidence Synthesis (BES) approach was used for synthesizing and reporting the results. Furthermore, the random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis and the Q-statistic was used to test the null hypothesis that all studies in the analysis share a common effect size. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-eight studies were identified, of which 30 were included. A total of 727 handball players (males = 388, females = 292) were included. 28 of the 30 studies were rated as high methodological quality studies (PEDRO score > 70%) while the rest of the studies were rated as moderate methodological quality studies (PEDRO score ≤ 60%). The mean effect size for the effectiveness of resistance training (RT) in improving jumping throw, running throw, and standing throw velocity were 1.128 (95% CI 0.457 - 1.798), 1.756 (95% CI 1.111 - 2.400), and 1.098 (95% CI 0.689 - 1.507) correspondingly. Traditional weight training using barbells in mostly compound lifts yielded the most significant and robust results. Other RT modalities such as elastic bands, medicine balls, core training and ballistic training showed no significant results or positive effects due to the limited number of the studies. CONCLUSION: Strong evidence exists only for the effectiveness of RT using barbells in increasing throwing velocity. In contrast, the remaining RT modalities, while yielding positive results, have limited support due to limited number of studies and the high heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to support various forms of RT in increasing throw distance. Finally, medicine ball training and elastic band training demonstrated no benefits in improving throwing accuracy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO ID: CRD42023393574."

      "abstract": "Background: Team handball involves a tremendous amount of shoulder motion with high forces during repeated extended external range of motion. This causes shoulder complaints and overuse injuries. While eccentric training for the lower extremity shows preventive effects by improving strength, range of motion and fascicle length, there is a research gap for the shoulder joint and for advanced tissue characterization using diffusion tensor imaging. Objectives: To investigate the effects of 6-week eccentric isokinetic resistance training on strength, flexibility, and fiber architecture characteristics of the external rotators compared to an active control group in junior male handball players. Methods: 15 subjects were randomly assigned to the eccentric training group and 14 subjects to the active control group (conventional preventive training). Primary outcome measures were eccentric and concentric isokinetic strength of the external rotators, range of motion, and muscle fascicle length and fascicle volume. Results: The intervention group, showed significant changes in eccentric strength (+15%). The supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles showed significant increases in fascicle length (+13% and +8%), and in fractional anisotropy (+9% and +6%), which were significantly different from the control group. Conclusion: Eccentric isokinetic training has a significant effect on the function and macroscopic structure of the shoulder external rotators in male junior handball players. While strength parameters and muscle structure improved, range of motion did not change. This research helps understanding the physiology of muscle and the role of eccentric training on shoulder function and muscle structure. Furthermore, DTI was found to be a promising tool for advanced tissue characterization, and the in vivo derived data can also serve as model input variables and as a possibility to extend existing ex-vivo muscle models. Future research is needed for functional and structural changes following convenient eccentric field exercises."

Athletes were randomly assigned either to the control (CG, n = 12; BH training only) or the experimental group (EG, n = 12; plyometric + sprint + BH training). Assessments conducted before and after the training period included a squat jump, a countermovement jump, the Abalakov jump, a 15-m sprint, a modified Course-Navette endurance test, and four sport-specific BH throwing speed tests: a standing penalty throw, a 3-step running throw, a jump throw, and a 360º jump throw. The training intervention enhanced all athletic performance measures (all, p < 0.05). In contrast, the only improvement in the CG included endurance performance (p< 0.05). Significant time-group differences were noted in favor of the EG compared to the CG (p< 0.05) in the squat jump, the countermovement jump, the Abalakov jump, the jump throw velocity and 360º jump throw velocity. In conclusion, compared to BH regular training, 6 weeks of sand surface preseason plyometric and sprint training combined with regular BH training induced greater improvements in athletic performance and specific skills in BH players."

      "abstract": "Effective sports training should be attuned to the athlete's specific conditionings and characteristics. In motor learning research, two often neglected factors that influence this resonance are the learner's athletic background and the structural diversity of exercises (e.g., relative similarity). In the setting of real-word training with higher external validity, this study examines the effects of three learning approaches (i.e., contextual interference (CI), differential learning (DL), and free-play control condition (CO)) on the parallel learning of handball (HB), volleyball (VB), and basketball (BB) skills, considering participants' prior sport backgrounds. Forty-five males (15 HB, 15 VB, and 15 BB players) with a mean age of 22 ± 1.4 years and at least 6 years of experience in the mastered discipline voluntarily participated in this study. A pre-post-retention test design including a 6-week-intervention program was employed. During the intervention period, participants engaged in three training sessions a week, with each one lasting approximately 80 min. Each of the three test sessions involved the execution of ten attempts of BB free-throw shooting, HB three-step goal throwing, and VB underarm passing following a blocked order. In terms of short-term (pre-post) gain, only the DL group significantly improved their performance in both non-mastered disciplines (p = 0.03, ES = 1.58 for the BB free-throw and p = 0.05, ES = 0.9 for the HB shooting tests), with a trend (ES = 0.53) towards an improvement in the performance of the mastered VB underarm-pass skill. In terms of relatively permanent gains, the CI group significantly improved their performances from pre- to retention test only in the non-mastered BB free-throw skill (p = 0.018, ES = 1.17). In contrast, the DL group significantly improved their performance at retention compared to the pre-test in both non-mastered BB (p = 0.004, ES = 1.65) and HB (p = 0.003, ES = 2.15) skills, with a trend (ES = 0.4) towards improvement in the mastered VB test. In both the short-term and relatively long-term, higher composite score gains were observed in DL compared to CI (p = 0.006, ES = 1.11 and 0.049, ES = 1.01) and CO (p = 0.001, ES = 1.73 and <0.0001, ES = 2.67). In conclusion, the present findings provide additional support for the potential advantages of the DL model over those of CI. These findings can serve as the basis for tailored training and intervention strategies and provide a new perspective for addressing various issues related to individual and situational learning."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interventions that are co-created with end-users, and that are informed by behavior change or implementation theories, support implementation in real world settings. However, injury prevention programs for youth athletes have typically been developed by experts with no, or insufficiently described, end-user involvement and without guidance by theories. The aim of the current study was to describe the development of a holistic injury prevention intervention for youth handball targeting end-users at different levels, through using knowledge from end-users and researchers/experts and applying relevant behavior change and implementation theories. METHODS: Knowledge from researchers/experts (sports medicine, sport psychology, handball, physical therapy, strength and conditioning (n = 14)) and end-users (coaches, players, club administrators, n = 16), and applying relevant implementation (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, CFIR), behavior change (Health Action Process Approach, HAPA) and motivational (Self-Determination Theory, SDT) theories, were used to co-design the intervention. Early end-users (coaches (n = 6), players (n = 3) and a club administrator (n = 1)) were interviewed for initial feedback. RESULTS: The intervention consisted of end-user-targeted information and training that was made available in a specifically developed interactive mobile application with modules for players, coaches, club administrators, and caregivers. Information for all end-users included benefits and principles of physical and psychological injury prevention training, load-management, motivation, and communication. Information about implementation was developed for club administrators specifically. For coaches, training to do with their teams included handball-specific injury prevention exercises (legs, shoulders, core) combined with psychological aspects (motivation, task focus, body awareness) to integrate within warm-up and handball skills training. Training for players included handball-specific multi-joint strength, power, and explosive exercises (legs, shoulders, core) and sport psychology exercises (self-awareness, relaxation, being in the present moment, prevent and handle stress). To support self-management, adoption, and motivation, programs were provided, and players and coaches could change, add, progress the difficulty of exercises, and build their own programs. Initial feedback from early end-users was generally positive. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing an approach where researchers/experts and end-users co-created injury prevention training specifically for youth handball, an intervention was generated that included information and holistic training targeting end-users at the individual (players, caregivers), team (coaches), and organizational (club administrators) levels."

We investigated the effects of eight weeks of IMT in women's handball. Twenty-four players were randomly distributed into experimental (EXP; n = 13) and control (CON; n = 11) groups. Only the EXP group performed IMT using the POWERBreathe device, following indications of the manufacturers. Before and after the intervention, spirometric variables were evaluated at rest and during a graded test using direct analysis of respiratory gases. Perception of exertion at submaximal intensity was also determined. No significant differences were observed post- vs. pre-intervention (p ≥ 0.05) regarding forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (VEF1), FVC/VEF1, maximal expiratory flow at 50% of FVC or peak inspiratory flow. Post-intervention, only the CON group increased their absolute and relative VO2max (2.1 ± 0.2 L/min pre vs. 2.2 ± 0.3 L/min post; 33.6 ± 3.6 ml/kg∙min pre vs. 34.5 ± 3.2 ml/kg∙min post, respectively). No significant improvements (p ≥ 0.05) were observed in VO2 associated with ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1), nor in the intensity associated with VO2max and VT1. However, there was a tendency for the mentioned variables to decrease in the CON group, while in the EXP group the trend was to maintain or increase previous values. IMT did not determine an improvement in the perception of exertion at submaximal intensity. The use of POWERBreathe, as described in the present study, is feasible in terms of time and effort, although its benefits may not be significant."

DATA SOURCES: Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL from inception until April 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies, contained a population of competitive team handball players, included an intervention designed specifically to prevent or reduce the risk of team handball injuries, and reported injury incidence rates specific to team handball players. Two researchers independently evaluated studies for inclusion and assessed their methodological quality. DATA EXTRACTION: Study design, intervention details, participant characteristics, and the number of injuries in each group were extracted from each study by 2 independent researchers. The outcome of interest was the incidence rate of injury. Injury data were classified into 5 groups: shoulder injuries, lower extremity injuries, knee injuries, anterior cruciate ligament injuries, and ankle injuries. Extracted data were analyzed using a random-effects model to compute the overall effect estimates of injury-prevention programs in reducing the risk of injuries. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated based on the number of injuries in each group. DATA SYNTHESIS: Meta-analyses were conducted independently for each injury classification. Results indicated that prevention programs reduced the risk of shoulder injuries (OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.42, 0.85; P = .004), lower extremity injuries (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.95; P = .03), knee injuries (OR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.35, 0.78; P = .002), anterior cruciate ligament injuries (OR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.96; P = .03), and ankle injuries (OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.81; P = .002) in team handball players. CONCLUSIONS: In team handball players, injury-prevention programs appear to effectively reduce the risk of shoulder, lower extremity, knee, ankle, and anterior cruciate ligament injuries.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The popularity of team handball is increasing, with >10 million children playing this overhead throwing and collision sport with highest demands on the shoulder joint. Because of the risk of recurrent instability, the Latarjet-Patte (LP) procedure has been recommended to treat young competitive players. This is the first LP outcome study in professional handball players. METHODS: We retrospectively included 20 shoulders (18 players [17 male patients]; mean age, 22.9 years [range, 17-35 years]; minimum follow-up period, 2 years; mean follow-up period, 6.6 years) operated on by 3 expert surgeons (2011-2020) with the Walch LP technique. We documented preoperative hyperlaxity (25%, n = 5), affected throwing arm (55%, n = 11), position (backcourt, winger, and goalkeeper, 22% each; full back and pivot, 17% each), >2 dislocations prior (20%, n = 4), >10 dislocations prior (5%, n = 1), previous failed Bankart or humeral avulsion of glenohumeral ligament (HAGL) repair (10%, n = 2), and large Hill-Sachs lesions (HSLs) (20%, n = 4). Clinical and radiographic outcomes, visual analog scale score, Subjective Shoulder Value, Walch-Duplay score, Rowe score, and return-to-sport (RTS) rate were recorded. RESULTS: The RTS rate was 85% (17 of 20 shoulders); rate of RTS at the same level, 80% (16 of 20); and rate of RTS with no throwing pain, 73% (8 of 11). The time to training with a ball was 3.2 months, and the time to competition was 4.9 months. The mean Rowe score, Walch-Duplay score, and Subjective Shoulder Value were 90 points, 88 points, and 89%, respectively. Shoulder symptoms led players to give up handball in 2 cases (10%), whereas 1 player (5%) stopped playing handball for other reasons. We recorded 1 recurrent dislocation (5%) (non-throwing arm, winger, no recurrence after rehabilitation). Persistent apprehension occurred in 1 goalkeeper (5%). Residual pain was seen in 4 shoulders (20%); this was relieved by screw removal in 1. Resistant pain (throwing shoulder) was seen in 2 backcourt players (10%, 1 of whom had a large HSL) and 1 goalkeeper (5%; large HSL with >10 dislocations prior), all 3 of whom were aged > 30 years. Bone block positioning was correct (no lateral overhang) in all shoulders. At final follow-up, 1 shoulder (5%) showed mild arthritic changes (>10 dislocations, large HSL). CONCLUSION: The open LP procedure is consistent in providing shoulder stability combined with return-to-throwing performance in professional handball players with a short time to RTS and high same-level RTS rate without increasing the risk of arthritic changes. Throwing shoulders of backcourt players, large HSLs, or age > 30 years may have an increased risk of persistent symptoms.",

Thirty-six male athletes were randomly separated into three groups: a control group (n = 12), a plyometric training group (PG, n = 12), and an eccentric-overload training group (EG, n = 12). The PG and EG performed upper- and lower-limb plyometric or eccentric-overload exercises, respectively, three times per week. Control groups performed regular handball training. The athletes were assessed for counter movement jump (CMJ) and Abalakov vertical jump (ABK) height, 15 m linear sprint time, handball-throwing speed (i.e., penalty throw; 3-step running throw; jump throw), and cardiorespiratory endurance through the 20 m shuttle-run test. Heart rate and blood lactate were measured at the end of the endurance test. No baseline differences were noted for dependent variables between groups. The session rating of perceived exertion was similar between the intervention groups (PG = 361 ± 12.2 AU; EG = 370 ± 13.3 AU). The ANOVA revealed significant (p < 0.05; Δ = 5-9%; effect size (ES) = 0.45-1.96). Similar improvements for experimental groups compared to the control group for CMJ, ABK jump, penalty throw, 3-step running throw, and jump throw. However, interventions did not affect 15 m, cardiorespiratory endurance, nor heart rate or blood lactate after the endurance test. In conclusion, an 8-week handball intervention by performing plyometric or eccentric-overload training in-season improves the physical and technical parameters of male players when compared to regular handball practice."

      "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury in athletes is rare but deleterious to their performance, entrapment being one of the most frequent causes. Isolated injury to the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) is rare and often underdiagnosed. The authors reported a clinical case of a 34-year-old handball athlete who presented with neuropathic pain in the inferolateral third of the leg and dorsum of the foot, with three months of evolution, after an ankle sprain, refractory to conservative treatment. After clinical assessment and ultrasound investigation, it was considered that the pain source was likely to be an SPN entrapment. Thus, a diagnostic ultrasound-guided nerve block with 2ml of 2% lidocaine and 3ml of 0.2% ropivacaine was performed, followed by nerve hydrodissection, with a major improvement in the patient's symptoms and functionality for three weeks. Thereafter, a long-lasting alternative was made - pulsed radiofrequency (pRF). There were no complications after the procedure. As a form of neuromodulation, pRF offered pain resolution without tissue damage or painful sequela, after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up and complete participation in sports activity, avoiding surgical treatment. With this clinical case, the authors intend to demonstrate the effectiveness of pRF in the resolution of peripheral neuropathy due to entrapment, avoiding more invasive treatment options and, in the case of an athlete, allowing an early return to play. They also intend to corroborate the advantage of using ultrasound in the diagnosis and guide of minimally invasive procedures."

      "abstract": "The main aim of the study was to compare the training methods of continuous endurance training versus handball small-sided games (SSGs) in female handball players during the preseason. Eighteen female handball players from a first league in the Czech Republic voluntarily participated in the study. They were divided into two groups (the SSG group [n = 9; age: 21.22 ± 3.03 years] and a running group (RG) [n = 9; age: 23.78 ± 3.77 years]). Both groups continued regular preseason training for six weeks. The SSG group played two small-sided games per week (a total of 12 games during the monitoring period) in their training sessions during the monitored six-week period. The RG ran twice per week, participating in continuous endurance training in the 12 training sessions during the monitored six-week period. Fitness tests (pretest/posttest) were performed prior to the six weeks of intervention and one week afterwards. The order of the fitness tests in sequence was as follows: 20-m and 30-m sprints, a Modified Agility T test (MAT), a Standing Long-Jump Test, ball-throwing velocity, and a Yo-Yo Intermittent Test level 1. In the SSG group, there was a significant improvement in the T test (p = 0.034), ball-throwing velocity (p = 0.019), and the Yo-Yo IR1 (p = 0.003) performance. The RG showed a significant improvement in the Standing Long-Jump Test (p = 0.049), ball-throwing velocity (p = 0.003), and the Yo-Yo IR1 (p = 0.003) performance. In conclusion, the SSGT method had a positive effect on female players' MAT, ball-throwing velocity and YoYo IR1 results, and the CERT method had a significant effect only on the YoYo IR1 results. Handball SSGs are a more suitable training method due to exercise specificity."

Fifty-four men (68 ± 4 years, stature 169 ± 6 cm; body mass 78.4 ± 10.7 kg; fat mass 27.1 ± 5.3%; BMI 27.4 ± 2.9 kg/m2; VO2peak 27.3 ± 4.8 mL/min/kg) were randomised into three intervention groups (TH1, n = 13; TH2, n = 15; or TH3, n = 12, performing 1, 2 and 3 weekly 60-min training sessions, respectively), and a control group (CG, n = 14). The training sessions consisted mainly of RTH matches played as small-sided and formal game formats (4v4, 5v5, 6v6 or 7v7) with adapted rules. Matches' mean and peak heart rate (HR) ranged from 78-80% and 86-89%HRmax, respectively, and distance covered from 4676 to 5202 m. A time x group interaction was observed for procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP), osteocalcin (OC), carboxy-terminal type-1 collagen crosslinks (CTX), sclerostin, upper and lower body dynamic strength, right arm fat mass, left and right arm, right leg and android total mass (TM; p ≤ 0.047) with the greatest effects being shown for TH2 and TH3 groups. Post-intervention group differences were observed in CTX, left arm and right leg TM (TH3 > TH1), P1NP (TH2 > CG), OC, right arm TM (TH3 > CG), upper (CG < TH1, TH2 and TH3) and lower body dynamic strength (CG < TH1 and TH3) (p ≤ 0.047). RTH was effective in enhancing bone health, body composition and physical fitness in middle-to-older-aged males, especially for the intervention groups that performed 2-3 weekly training sessions.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05295511.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05295511.HighlightsAfter 16 weeks of recreational team handball small-sided and formal matches, inactive middle-to-older-aged males improved bone health, body composition and physical fitness, by performing 1, 2 or 3 60-min weekly sessions, however, greater improvements were shown in the groups that performed 2 or 3 weekly training sessions.Training intensity was similar across the intervention groups that performed recreational team handball for 1, 2 or 3 60-min weekly sessions, which means that training volume is most likely to be the reason for the different health effects shown.The very high fun levels reported by all intervention groups shows that recreational team handball is a social and fun exercise modality for middle-to-older-aged males, with potential to intrinsically motivate the participants and assure long-term adherence to exercise.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of communication and coordination combined with designing a progressive and individualised sport-specific training program for reducing injury prevalence in youth female and male football and handball players transitioning to a sports academy high school. An additional aim was to investigate the characteristics of the reported injuries. METHODS: Forty-two Norwegian athletes were randomised into an intervention or control group. Mean age, height, weight and BMI was 15.5 ± 0.5 years, 178.6 cm ± 6.3 cm, 71.3 ± 9.8 kg, 22.3 ± 2.7 BMI for the intervention group (IG) (n = 23), and 15.4 ± 0.5 years, 175.6 cm ± 6.6 cm, 67.1 ± 9.8 kg, 21.7 ± 2.4 BMI for the control group (CG) (n = 19). During the summer holiday, the intervention group received weekly progressive, individualised sport-specific training programs and weekly follow-up telephone calls from the researchers. All athletes completed a baseline questionnaire and a physical test battery. Training data and injuries were recorded prospectively for 22 weeks using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Questionnaire on Health Problems (OSTRC-H2). A two-way chi-square (χ2) test of independence was conducted to examine the relationship between groups and injury. RESULTS: Average weekly prevalence of all injuries was 11% (95% CI: 8%-14%) in IG and 19% (95% CI: 13%-26%) in CG. Average weekly prevalence of substantial injuries was 7% (95% CI: 3%-10%) in IG and 10% (95% CI: 6%-13%) in CG. The between-group difference in injuries was significant: χ2 (1, N = 375) = 4.865, p = .031, φ = .114, with 1.8 times higher injury risk in CG vs. IG during the first 12 weeks after enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: For student athletes transitioning to a sports academy high school, progressive individualised, sport-specific training programs reduced the prevalence of all-complaint injuries following enrolment. Clubs and schools should prioritise time and resources to implement similar interventions in periods where student athletes have less supervision, such as the summer holidays, to facilitate an optimal transition to a sports academy high school."

METHODS: A total of 14 untrained secondary school male students, aged 17 to 18, took part in a three-session practical intervention. Students were divided into two teams of seven players (four field players, a goalkeeper, and two substitutes). During each experimental session, each team played one 8 min period under teacher verbal encouragement (TeacherEN) and another under peer verbal encouragement (PeerEN). All sessions were videotaped for later analysis using a specific grid focusing on the balls played, balls won, balls lost, shots on goal, goals scored, as well as the ball conservation index (BCI), and the defensive efficiency index (DEI). RESULTS: The findings showed no significant differences in favor of TeacherEN in all the performance indicators that were measured, whereas significant differences in favor of PeerEN were observed in balls played and shots on goal. CONCLUSIONS: When implemented in handball small-sided games, peer verbal encouragement can produce greater positive effects than teacher verbal encouragement in terms of offensive performance."

Fifty-four inactive middle-aged-to-elderly men (67.5 ± 4.2 years; stature 168.8 ± 6.2 cm; body mass 78.4 ± 10.7 kg; fat mass 27.1 ± 5.3%; BMI 27.4 ± 2.9 kg/m2; VO2peak 27.3 ± 4.8 mL/min/kg) were randomised into three intervention groups performing 1 (TH1, n = 13), 2 (TH2, n = 15), or 3 (TH3, n = 12) 60-min weekly recreational TH-based training sessions, for 16 weeks, and a control group (CG, n = 14). A time x group interaction was observed for VO2peak, aerobic performance, fasting plasma insulin and body and fat mass (p ≤ 0.043) with TH3 showing the greatest overall effects. Post-intervention differences were observed in aerobic performance (TH3>CG, TH1 and TH2; TH2>CG), body mass (TH3>CG and TH1), fat mass (TH3>CG), VO2peak (TH3>CG) and plasma insulin (TH3>CG) (p ≤ 0.040). In conclusion, recreational TH performed for 60-min thrice and twice per week results in improved aerobic performance for middle-aged-to-elderly men. Moreover, it was observed that three weekly sessions were more effective in providing overall cardiometabolic benefits compared to training with a lower weekly frequency. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05295511.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05295511.Highlights: We observed high intensities and fun levels during recreational TH, organised as formal and small-sided games, for middle-aged-to-elderly men during a 16-week period, independently of the number of weekly training sessions.Marked positive effects on aerobic performance and cardiometabolic health were observed in the intervention group that performed 3 weekly sessions.The study results indicate that recreational TH training with low frequency and volume results in some beneficial effects on cardiometabolic fitness and health for middle-aged-to-elderly men, but future studies with more participants or longer intervention periods are warranted to explore this possibility.",

Attendance was 2.0 ± 0.4 sessions/week (first 16 weeks) and 1.4 ± 0.5 (following 20 weeks) and mean heart rate (HR) loading was 77 and 79% of maximal HR (p = .002) for the first 16 and the following 20 weeks, respectively. Cardiovascular, bone, metabolic health, body composition and physical fitness markers were evaluated at baseline, and after 16 and 36 weeks. An interaction (p ≤ .046) was shown for the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, HDL, Yo-Yo intermittent endurance level 1 test (YYIE1) and knee strength, in favour of EXG. At 36 weeks, YYIE1 and knee strength were higher (p ≤ .038) for EXG vs CG. Also, within-group improvements (p ≤ .043) were observed after 36 weeks for EXG in VO2peak, lumbar spine bone mineral density, lumbar spine bone mineral content, P1NP, osteocalcin, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, body mass, android fat mass, YYIE1, knee strength, handgrip strength and postural balance. At 36 comparatively to 16 weeks, EXG showed an increase (p ≤ .036) in fasting blood glucose, HDL, knee strength and handgrip strength, and a decrease (p ≤ .025) in LDL. Collectively, this multicomponent exercise training (RTH) induces beneficial changes in global health status in postmenopausal women.HighlightsWe evaluated the long-term effects of a recreational team handball-based multicomponent training on broad-spectrum health and physical fitness markers of inactive postmenopausal women.Improvements in VO2peak and aerobic performance achieved after 16 weeks of training were maintained at 36 weeks.The 20-week extension of the training intervention resulted in further improvements in lipid profile markers and physical fitness variables.Recreational team handball could be suggested as an effective and safe strategy to counteract postmenopausal health-related constrains.",

      "abstract": "Low energy availability may precede or be caused by cognitive disturbances in professional athletes. Related psychological problems include disordered eating patterns, body shape preoccupation, depression or anxiety. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of different personalised dietary plans on psychological factors in young professional female handball players with low energy availability. This 12-week randomised clinical trial involved 21 female players aged 22 ± 4 years, 172.0 ± 5.4 cm and 68.4 ± 6.7 kg divided into three groups (FD: free diet; MD: Mediterranean diet; HAD: high antioxidant diet). Eating behaviour (Eating Attitude Test, EAT-26: diet, bulimia and oral control subscales), body image (Body Shape Questionnaire, BSQ) and mood state (Profile of Mode State, POMS: tension, vigour, anger, depression, fatigue) were assessed. All participants showed low energy availability (<30 kcal/lean mass per day). The different plans showed no significant differences between them but significant differences over time within groups for the variables: body image, Tension, Vigour and Depression (p < 0.05). Eating behaviour improved slightly but did not show statistically significant changes. Following an adequate nutritional planning for athletes seems to improve the mood and body perception of young female handball players. A longer intervention period is required to assess the differences between diets and improvement of other parameters."

The objectives of the study were as follows: (i) to quantify the subjective external load-eTL of tasks framed in didactic units designed by in-service teachers; and (ii) to analyze the differences in the subjective eTL according to the game situation and the game space. A total of 306 learning tasks designed by seven in-service teachers (five men and two women), with more than 10 years of teaching practice, were analyzed. These tasks were coded through the Integral System for Training Task Analysis (SIATE, acronym in Spanish). The interobserver reliability of the coded variables obtained a considerable concordance (MKfree > 0.70). The results indicated that there were significant differences in the subjective eTL according to the game situation and game space. The situations of small-sided games in numerical equality or inequality and full games, in medium spaces or large spaces, presented a higher subjective eTL and therefore the highest physiological and motor demands on students. The inclusion of attacking or defending players and an adequate selection of the game space indicated the importance of planning and organizing learning tasks.",

      "abstract": "The objective was to investigate the effects of a 6-week core strengthening training within the regular handball training sessions compared to regular handball training only. Male sub-elite handball players were randomly assigned to an intervention (INT: n = 13; age: 16.9 ± 0.6 years) or a control (CON: n = 13; age: 17.2 ± 0.8 years) group. The INT group performed the \"big 3\" core exercises cross curls-up, side bridge (both sides), and the quadrupedal stance (\"birddog exercise\") triweekly for 20-30 min while the CON group conducted regular handball training only. Pre- and post-training assessments included measures of muscular endurance (Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test [CKCUEST] and the Bourban test), shoulder mobility/stability (Upper Quarter Y Balance [YBT-UQ] test), and throwing velocity. The ANCOVA revealed significant differences between means in favour of the INT group for the dorsal chain (p < 0.001,  η p 2   = 0.46) and the lateral chain (left side: p = 0.015,  η p 2   = 0.22; right side: p = 0.039,  η p 2   = 0.17) of the Bourban test, the composite score (p = 0.024,  η p 2   = 0.20) of the throwing arm reach and the inferolateral reach direction (p = 0.038,  η p 2   = 0.17), and the composite score (p = 0.027,  η p 2   = 0.19) of the non-throwing arm reach of the YBT-UQ. However, performance in the CKCUEST and throwing velocity did not show any group-specific changes. Therefore, 6 weeks of core strengthening training were effective in improving some components of physical but no handball-specific athletic (i.e., throwing velocity) performance in adolescent male sub-elite handball players. Practitioners may still opt for this training regimen when stimulus variability is sought or when a low load/low movement approach (e.g., during rehabilitation) is favoured."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The intensity of strength training exercise is generally regarded to be the most essential element in developing muscle strength and power. The exercise intensity of strength training is known as one-repetition maximum (1RM). Velocity-based training (VBT) has been proposed as a different approach for determining training intensity. VBT relies on the use of linear position transducers and inertial measurement units, providing real-time feedback to objectively adjust the exercise intensity based on an athlete's velocity zone. METHODS: This study investigated the effects of two different training interventions based on individualized load velocity profiles (LVP) on maximal bench press strength (i.e., 1RM), maximum throwing velocity (TV), and skeletal muscle mass (SKMM). Twenty-two university handball players were randomly assigned to Group 1 (low-movement speed training) or Group 2 (high-movement speed training). Group 1 exercised with a bar speed of 0.75-0.96 m/s, which corresponds to a resistance of approximately 60% 1RM, whereas Group 2 trained at 1.03-1.20 m/s, corresponding to a resistance of approximately 40% 1RM. Both groups exercised three times a week for five weeks, with strength and throwing tests performed at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied, and the results showed the interaction between group and time was not statistically significant for SKMM (p = 0.537), 1RM (p = 0.883), or TV (p = 0.774). However, both groups significantly improved after the five weeks of training: SKMM (3.1% and 3.5%, p < 0.01), 1RM (15.5% and 15.0%, p < 0.01), and throwing velocity (18.7% and 18.3%, p < 0.01) in Group 1 and 2 respectively. Training at both prescribed velocities in this study elicited similar changes in strength, muscle mass, and throwing velocity.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: When playing handball, the preservation of the subacromial space, which can be quantified by the acromiohumeral distance (AHD), plays a crucial role for shoulder health of handball players. Acute effects of handball-specific loading on the subacromial space with consideration of individual adaptions resulting from long-term handball-specific loading experience have yet to be determined in order to prevent injuries such as e. g. an impingement of the supraspinatus tendon. OBJECTIVE: To (1) assess the acute effects of handball-specific loading on the AHD in healthy experienced handball players (HB) and non-handball experienced athletes (CG) and (2) to assess the AHD behavior in relation to individual intrinsic factors to identify possible risk factors and the effect of handball-specific experience associated adaptations. PARTICIPANTS: 20 HB (10m; 10f) and 20 CG (10m; 10f); 24 ± 5 years. INTERVENTION: Handball-specific loading protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The AHD was measured by ultrasonography at 0° and 60° abduction pre and post intervention. Isometric shoulder strength was measured with hand-held dynamometry. Shoulder range of motion (ROM) was measured with goniometry. RESULTS: Handball-specific loading led to significantly reduced AHD in the dominant shoulder in the 60° abducted position in both groups (HB: -1.7 ± 2.0 mm; p = 0.001, d = 0.69; CG: -1.1 ± 2.0 mm; p = 0.024, d = 0.37) and in the non-dominant shoulder in 0° (-0.7 ± 1.5 mm; p = 0.038, d = 0.35) and 60° abducted position (-1.3 ± 1.8 mm; p = 0.004, d = 0.69) in HB only. Handball-specific loading enhanced AHD reduction when elevating the shoulder from 0° to 60° in both groups and arms. Larger shoulder abduction strength affected the maintenance of the AHD positively. HB demonstrated less shoulder strength compared to CG, while ROM did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Handball-specific loading can affect the ability to preserve the subacromial space which might put handball players at risk for shoulder injuries. Poor shoulder strength can aggravate this mechanism. Therefore, implementation of strengthening exercises of the external rotator and abductor muscles in the training schedule may improve shoulder health of handball players."

In all conditions, blood pressure, heart-rate, and body composition were measured pre- and post- Wingate test. Players were assessed by the Wingate test in two 30-second phases with a 1-minute break between the phases. Blood [lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CK)] was drawn pre- and immediately post- the Wingate test. In players with CS condition, 60 g of creatine was consumed per day in three consecutive days prior to the study (3 meals of 20 g in morning, noon, and night). The DCT was performed after Wingate test to consider its possible effects for alleviating the muscle injury markers. Data were evaluated using analysis of covariance followed by a post-hoc Bonferoni test.

This study examined the effects of six-week eccentric hamstring training on dynamic balance performance in youth handball players of different maturity statuses (pre- or post-peak height velocity (PHV)). A randomized controlled design with 45 young male handball players (14.6 ± 0.3 years) from a local national handball club were randomly allocated to a 6 week, twice weekly eccentric hamstring training in two experimental groups: a pre-PHV (maturation offset: −2.13 ± 0.63, n = 10) and post-PHV (maturation offset: 0.79 ± 0.34, n = 12) group and two control groups: maturation offset: −2.09 ± 0.61, n = 10 and maturation offset: 0.55 ± 0.67, n = 13. Dynamic balance performance was evaluated by using the composite score during the lower quarter Y-balance test from pre- and post-intervention. A significant effect on balance scores was found from pre to post (F = 11.4; p = 0.002; η2p = 0.22), intervention (F = 5.4; p = 0.025; η2p = 0.12), and maturation (F = 369; p < 0.001; η2p = 0.9), but no significant interaction effects were found (F ≥ 3.3; p ≥ 0.077; η2p ≤ 0.07). Post hoc analysis revealed that the post-PHV group had a higher score than the pre-PHV group. Furthermore, that dynamic balance increased in the post-PHV group after intervention much more in the control post-PHV group. It was concluded that somatic maturation influences dynamic balance performance and that eccentric hamstring training results in greater improvement in balance performance in young male handball players for the post-pubertal group.",

The management of these injuries is unclear and controversial. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report we present a professional female handball player with an acute intramuscular/costal tear of the latissimus dorsi, managed operatively. The patient injured extremity was the dominant throwing arm with a palpable muscle gap of 3 cm. Operative treatment was taken and objective follow-up using UCLA shoulder rating scale and DASH scores; demonstrating a progressive improvement between day zero (UCLA 13pts and DASH 36.7 pts) and the final 6 months (UCLA 33pts and DASH 0.8 pts) follow up; returning to sport at 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: Latissimus dorsi costal tears are uncommon injuries that can also be seen in hip throwing athletes. Surgical management should be considered if the dominant arm is affected and a 3cm muscle gap is present."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Handball is associated with a high risk of overuse shoulder injury. This study investigated if an injury prevention programme effectively reduces overuse injury to the throwing shoulder of handball athletes. METHODS: 61 men's and women's handball teams (u-19 and senior athletes) were cluster-randomised into an intervention and a control group in the 2019-2020 season. Players of the intervention group regularly carried out an injury prevention programme. Both groups documented overuse shoulder injuries via an online questionnaire every second week. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of overuse injury to the throwing shoulder. Secondary endpoints were the influence of compliance on the primary endpoint and intensity of overuse shoulder symptoms measured by a shortened, handball-specific Western Ontario Shoulder Index (WOSI). RESULTS: 31 teams (295 players) in the intervention group and 30 teams (284 players) in the control group were included for analyses. The overall questionnaire response rate was 61%. The average prevalence of overuse shoulder injury did not significantly differ between the intervention group (n=109, 38.4% (95% CI 32.9% to 44.2%)) and the control group (n=106, 35.9% (95% CI 30.7% to 41.6%), p=0.542). Compliance with the intervention programme did not significantly affect overuse shoulder injury (p=0.893). Using generalised estimating equations for WOSI, the estimated mean for the intervention group was 44.6 points (95% CI 42.0 to 47.1) and 47.6 points for the control group (95% CI 44.9 to 50.3, p=0.111). CONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent exercise programme using rubber bands and stretching did not significantly reduce the prevalence or symptoms of overuse throwing shoulder injury in handball athletes of both sexes.

In this case, 24 handball players were randomly assigned into experimental warm-up and control groups. The HWP was performed over 8 weeks (3 times per week). Dynamic balance before and after the intervention training programs were measured by the Biodex Balance System (BBS) and Y Balance test for the dominant (DL) and non-dominant legs (non-DL). After HWP training, BBS scores significantly improved in the overall (OSI) (30.4% and 31.1%), anterior-posterior (APSI) (44.6% and 35.2%), and medial-lateral stability indexes (MLSI) (38.8% and 43%) for both DL and non-DL. Post-training, the Y Balance test exhibited significant improvements in OSI (13.2% and 10.6%), anterior (17.2% and 12.6%), posteriolateral (12.8% and 11.3%), and posteriomedial stability indexes (9.2% and 7.9%) with DL and non-DL, respectively. In conclusion, dynamic balance improved overall after eight weeks of the HWP, with this improvement significantly greater with the trained versus the control group. Optimal balance during handball is an important factor to ensure coordinated and efficient movements and it is speculated that improved balance could positively impact injury prevention. Hence, the HWP program can be used as an alternative to a conventional warm-up program."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects (age ~17 years) were randomly divided between experimental (n=17) and control (n=15) groups. During the 8-week intervention, the experimental group replaced a part of their regular regimen by HIIT, combined with plyometric exercise. Assessments in both groups before and after the intervention included: squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), sprint performance (5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 30 m), change of direction tests (Illinois modified test [Illinois-MT] and T-half test), 20-m shuttle run, and repeated sprint T-test. RESULTS: The two-way analyses of variance revealed significant group-time interactions (all p<0.05), favoring the intervention group in 5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 30 m sprint (d=0.33, 8.3%; d=0.52, 7.6%; d=0.57, 6.8%; and d=0.58, 8.8%, respectively), T-half (d=0.25, 5.1%), Illinois-MT (d=0.47, 4.2%), SJ and CMJ (d=0.34-0.39, 34-4-34.9%), repeated sprint T-test best time, mean time and total time (d=0.83, 6.9%; d=0.62, 7.4%; and d=0.61, 7.2%, respectively), 20 meter shuttle run test aerobic maximum speed and predicted maximal oxygen intake (d=0.36, 7.5%; d=0.19, 9.4%, respectively).

      "abstract": "Several resistance training programs using conventional methodologies have been implemented with the purpose of improving the ability to perform power actions in handball, especially during the competitive season. In contrast, methodologies based on a contemporary perspective, which considers the human being as a self-regulating biological entity, and designed specifically for female college players, are scarce. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of an eight-week resistance training program, in which the athletes were able to control the loads according to their self-perceived effort and rest on their repeated shuttle sprint and jump ability. The sample was composed of 16 female players of a handball team from the faculty of physics and mathematics sciences of a Chilean university. The RSSJA test was used to evaluate players' conditions pre- and post-training program, and the self-perceived effort scale called OMNI-RES was used for the prediction and control of loads. Results indicated that, after the application of an eight-week resistance training program, significant improvements p ≤ 0.05 on the jump height (pre: 1836.4 W; average post: 2088.9 W) and running speed (average pre: 3.2 m/s; average post: 4.0 m/s) were obtained, as well as a significant reduction in the loss of power and speed between each set of the applied test.",

Methods: A randomised, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial was designed. Thirty HB athletes with shoulder pain were randomly assigned to the DN group (n = 15) or control group (n = 15). The DN group received a single session of ultrasound-guided DN technique in the teres major muscle. The control group received no intervention. Pain intensity during throwing actions (Numeric Pain Rating Score), shoulder ROM (inclinometer), isometric strength (hand-held dynamometer), and extensibility (inclinometer) were measured before and after treatment. Results: DN group showed statistically significant improvements with large effect sizes for pain intensity (p < 0.001; E.S: 1.3), internal rotation ROM (p < 0.001; E.S: 3.0) and extensibility (p < 0.001; E.S: 2.9) compared to the control group. No statistically significant differences were found for isometric strength (p > 0.05). Conclusion: A single session of DN in the teres major muscle was effective for improving pain intensity during throwing actions, internal rotation ROM and extensibility in HB athletes with shoulder pain."

Pre- and post-training assessments included measures of strength endurance (Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test [CKCUEST]), maximal isometric strength (MIS), and throwing velocity. Significant main effects of Test (i.e. pre- to post-training enhancements) were detected for the CKCUEST (p < 0.001, 0.54 ≤ η p 2 ≤ 0.57) and throwing velocity (p = 0.001, η p 2 = 0.34). We found a significant (throwing velocity: p = 0.004, η p 2 = 0.25) and a tendency toward (MIS of the internal rotators, non-throwing arm: p = 0.068, η p 2 = 0.12) a significant Test × Group interaction, both in favour of the INT-group.

PURPOSE: To investigate the postoperative outcomes of arthroscopic treatment for anterior shoulder instability as well as the return-to-sport (RTS) rate in professional handball players. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Involved in this study were 44 competitive handball players (47 shoulders) who underwent arthroscopic anterior capsulolabral reconstruction between 2010 and 2018 and had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. After surgery, patients completed a questionnaire that collected Rowe and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores and RTS data, and we compared these results with their preoperative scores. We also compared results according to the following subgroups: true dislocations versus recurrent subluxations, younger (<20 years) versus older (≥20 years) age, male versus female sex, and shorter versus longer duration of instability. Statistical analysis included the paired-samples t test and nonparametric Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 52.2 ± 21.4 months. There were 4 shoulders (9%) with recurrent instability. There were significant preoperative to postoperative improvements in the mean Rowe score (from 45.2 to 91.8) and mean ASES score (from 70.6 to 95.7) (P < .001 for both). Overall, the RTS rate was 83%, and 64% (30/47 shoulders) were able to return to their preinjury level. The RTS rate was significantly lower in the younger players than in the older players (46% vs 86%, respectively; P = .005). CONCLUSION: The study results indicated that handball players with anterior shoulder instability can be treated using arthroscopic labral reconstruction successfully and 83% of the athletes were able to RTS activity. The handball players aged ≥20 years returned to their preinjury level of sport at a higher rate than did those aged <20 years."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sling-based training focused on rotational exercises would improve shooting performance in outfield handball players during the competitive season, and whether changes in performance were related to altered levels of core strength and rotational velocity. Twenty-five female outfield handball players (mean age 19.5 ± 2.0 years, height 1.72 ± 0.06 m, body mass 71.5 ± 8.6 kg, training experience 10.3 ± 2.4 years), performed 7 m shots, with and without a run-up, and jump shots. Maximal ball velocity, peak rotational velocity of the trunk with different loads and 1RM in a core strength test were measured before and after an 8-week training intervention. Players were divided into a sling-based and a plyometric/sprint training (control) group that trained three times per week for 8 weeks. The main findings were that sling-based training increased ball velocity by on average 3.2% across three techniques tested, while shooting performance decreased by 3% in the control group. However, both training groups demonstrated increased peak rotational velocity with different loads, but not the calculated 1RM core strength after the training period. It was concluded that sling-based training with rotational core exercises could improve maximal ball velocity in female handball players during a competitive season by around 3%. However, this increased ball velocity may have been caused by increased angular velocity in the core, rather than absolute maximal core strength. It is suggested that sling-based training has impacted timing variables of the different involved segments, or possibly power transfer between segments, which may explain the enhancement in ball velocity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reduced activation of the hamstring muscles and specifically the medial semitendinosus muscle (ST) has been shown to be a risk factor for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Specific hamstring strength exercises may show high ST activity, however the effect of unilateral vs. bilateral exercise execution on ST activation remains unknown. PURPOSE: To investigate selected lower limb strengthening exercises performed either unilaterally or bilaterally to identify 1) which exercise elicited the highest hamstring activation, 2) which exercise elicited the highest ST activation, and 3) to examine if unilateral exercise execution altered the medio-lateral hamstring activation pattern. Furthermore, the kinematic characteristics of each specific exercise and execution modality were determined to reveal possible causes for differences in medio-lateral hamstring activation between the different exercise conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Single-session repeated measures were obtained in a randomized manner. Twenty-three female elite team handball players were recruited. Hamstring electromyographic (EMG) activity and 3D kinematics were obtained during selected lower limb exercises (hip thrust, kettlebell swing, Romanian deadlift). Hamstring EMG activity, normalized to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) (nEMG), and inter-muscular activation difference between the ST and lateral hamstring biceps femoris (BF) were compared across exercises using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Bilateral hip thrust demonstrated highest overall hamstring activity (68.9±16.6 %). Kettlebell swing (Δ13%-point, p<0.01) and Romanian deadlift (Δ20-24%-point, p<0.01) demonstrated greater ST-BF activation differences (Δ=ST-BF) in favor of ST compared to hip thrust (Δ2-7%). Positive correlations were observed between knee joint angle and ST activity in kettlebell swing and deadlift. CONCLUSION: Kettlebell swing, deadlift and hip thrust all produced high activation of the hamstring muscles. Kettlebell swing and both deadlift exercises were superior in activating ST over BF, favoring these exercises in the prevention of non-contact ACL injury in female athletes, which should be evaluated in future intervention studies.

Cardiovascular risk factors and diseases were examined in asymptomatic Hungarian elite handball referees undergoing extended screening: personal/family history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, laboratory tests, body-composition analysis, echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Holter-ECG (n = 8), blood pressure monitorization (n = 10), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR; n = 27) and computer tomography (CCT; n = 4) were also carried out if needed. We examined 100 referees (age: 29.6±7.9years, male: 64, training: 4.3±2.0 hours/week), cardiovascular risk factors were: positive medical history: 24%, overweight: 10%, obesity: 3%, dyslipidaemia: 41%. Elevated resting blood pressure was measured in 38%. Stress-ECG was positive due to ECG-changes in 16%, due to elevated exercise blood pressure in 8%. Echocardiography and/or CMR identified abnormalities in 19%. A significant number of premature ventricular contractions was found on the Holter-ECG in two cases. The CCT showed myocardial bridge or coronary plaques in one-one case. We recommended lifestyle changes in 58%, new/modified antihypertensive or lipid-lowering therapy in 5%, iron-supplementation in 22%. By our results, a high percentage of elite Hungarian handball referees had cardiovascular risk factors or diseases, which, combined with physical and psychological stress, could increase the possibility of cardiovascular events. Our study draws attention to the importance of cardiac screening in elite handball referees.",

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The sample included 6 adolescent handball teams (3 female, 3 male) with a total of 92 players and a mean age of 16.6 years. Players were randomized within teams to an intervention group, which completed a shoulder ER strengthening program of 2 exercises performed 3 times per week after handball training for 8 weeks, or a control group of no treatment. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in shoulder ER strength change, measured as isometric strength using a handheld dynamometer from preintervention to postintervention (8 weeks). Secondary outcomes were between-group differences in internal rotation (IR) strength and the ER/IR strength ratio from preintervention to postintervention. RESULTS: The estimated between-group difference in dominant-shoulder ER strength was 0.06 N/kg (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.01, 0.14) in favor of the intervention group. The estimated between-group differences in the ER/IR ratio and IR strength were 0.03 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.08) and 0.02 (95% CI: -0.08, 0.13), respectively.

The present study investigated if a functional high-load exercise intervention, designed to facilitate tendon adaptation and reduce muscle-tendon imbalances, may prevent patellar tendon pain in adolescent male handball players (12-14 years). Tendon pain prevalence (using VISA-P scores), knee extensor strength, vastus lateralis (VL) architecture and patellar tendon mechanical properties were measured at four measurement time points (M1-M4) over a season. The control group (CON; n = 18; age 13.1 ± 0.7 yrs, height 170 ± 8 cm, mass 58 ± 10 kg) followed the usual strength training plan, including muscular endurance and explosive strength components. In the experimental group (EXP; n = 16; 13.1 ± 0.6 yrs, 169 ± 11 cm, 58 ± 16 kg), two sessions per week with functional high-load exercises for the patellar tendon were integrated in the strength training schedule, aiming to provide repetitive high-intensity loading of at least 3 s loading duration per repetition. While in the control group 30% of the athletes reported a clinically significant aggravation of symptoms, all players in the experimental group remained or became pain-free at M2 until the end of the season. There was a similar increase of strength (normalized to body mass; CON: 3.1%, d = 0.22; EXP: 6.8%, d = 0.47; p = 0.04) and VL thickness (CON: 4.8%, d = 0.28; EXP: 5.7%, d = 0.32; p < 0.001) in both groups, but no significant changes of tendon stiffness or maximum tendon strain. Further, both groups demonstrated similar fluctuations of tendon strain over time. We conclude that functional high-load exercises can reduce the prevalence of patellar tendon pain in adolescent athletes even without a reduction of tendon strain."

Participants were assigned between control (n = 15, age: 18.1 ± 0.5 years, body mass: 73.7 ± 13.9 kg, height: 1.82 ± 0.06 m, body fat: 14.4 ± 6.0%) and experimental groups (n = 14, age: 17.7 ± 0.3 years, body mass: 76.8 ± 10.7 kg, height: 1.83 ± 0.04 m, body fat: 13.4 ± 3.8%). Measures obtained before and after the intervention included a cycle ergometer force-velocity test, squat and countermovement jump characteristics, sprints times, repeated change of direction and change of direction tests (COD), a 1-RM half-back squat, and anthropometric estimates of limb volumes. Gains in the experimental group relative to controls included absolute muscle power (W) (Δ 23.1%; p < 0.05; ES = 0.565), relative muscle power (W.kg-1) (Δ 22.1%; p < 0.05; ES = 0.573), sprint times over 5 and 30 m (Δ-8.7%; p < 0.01; ES = 0.921 and Δ-7.2%; p < 0.05; ES = 0.573, respectively), COD times (Δ-9.2%; p < 0.05; ES = 0.561) and all repeated COD parameters except the fatigue index. However, a significant improvement by time interaction was observed in both groups on some anthropometric parameters (leg muscle volume and surface section thigh max), 1-RM half- back squat and vertical jump performance. We conclude that bi-weekly elastic band-loaded plyometric training improves the ability to sprint, COD and repeated COD relative to regular training, and thus it can be recommended to young male team handball players as a new method of plyometric training to improve important elements of their physical performance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women have an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which can be counteracted by conventional exercise regimes or recreational football. Less is known about the impact of exercise programmes based on other team sports. Thus, we examined the effects of recreational team handball on aerobic performance, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic health in untrained postmenopausal women. METHODS: Sixty-seven participants (age 68 ± 6 years, stature 157 ± 6 cm, body mass 67 ± 10 kg, fat mass 37 ± 7%, VO2peak 25.2 ± 3.6 mL/min/kg, Yo-Yo intermittent endurance level 1 test performance (YYIE1) 230 ± 103 m) with no previous experience of team handball were randomly allocated to either a team handball (THG, n = 41) or a control (CG, n = 26) group. THG performed 2-3 60-min training sessions per week for 16 weeks. YYIE1 performance and cardiometabolic markers were evaluated at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Average attendance during recreational team handball training was 1.9 ± 0.4 sessions per week, with mean heart rates of 76 ± 6%HRmax and 18 ± 9 min (44 ± 20% of total time) played at HR > 80%HRmax. A between-group effect was observed for YYIE1 performance, with a more pronounced improvement in aerobic exercise performance in THG compared to CG (70 ± 62 vs 15 ± 44%; p < 0.001). Within-group improvements (p < 0.05) were observed for THG with regard to VO2peak (7 ± 10%), incremental treadmill test time to exhaustion (TTE) (11 ± 14%), total cholesterol (-3 ± 9%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-2 ± 14%), with no significant changes in CG except an increase (p < 0.05) in TTE. Post-intervention values were higher for THG vs CG for YYIE1 performance (88%; 406 ± 216 vs 216 ± 75 m) and VO2peak (10%; 27.5 ± 3.8 vs 24.9 ± 3.6 mL/min/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Recreational team handball can be used to obtain moderate-to-vigorous aerobic intensities, and just 2 weekly 60-min team handball training sessions for 16 weeks can result in improvements in aerobic performance and in markers of cardiorespiratory fitness in postmenopausal women with no previous experience of the sport.",

      "abstract": "Previous investigations have found that several genes may be associated with the interindividual variability to the ergogenic response to caffeine. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of the genetic variations in CYP1A2 (-163C  > A, rs762551; characterized such as \"fast\" (AA genotype) and \"slow\" caffeine metabolizers (C-carriers)) and ADORA2A (1976T  > C; rs5751876; characterized by \"high\" (TT genotype) or \"low\" sensitivity to caffeine (C-carriers)) on the ergogenic response to acute caffeine intake in professional handball players. Thirty-one professional handball players (sixteen men and fifteen women; daily caffeine intake = 60 ± 25 mg·d-1) ingested 3 mg·kg-1·body mass (bm) of caffeine or placebo 60 min before undergoing a battery of performance tests consisting of a countermovement jump (CMJ), a sprint test, an agility test, an isometric handgrip test, and several ball throws. Afterwards, the handball players performed a simulated handball match (2 × 20 min) while movements were recorded using inertial units. Saliva samples were analyzed to determine the genotype of each player for the -163C  > A polymorphism in the CYP1A2 gene (rs762551) and for the 1976T  > C polymorphism in the ADORA2A gene (rs5751876). In the CYP1A2, C-allele carriers (54.8%) were compared to AA homozygotes (45.2%). In the ADORA2A, C-allele carriers (80.6%) were compared to TT homozygotes (19.4%). There was only a genotype x treatment interaction for the ball throwing from 7 m (p = 0.037) indicating that the ergogenic effect of caffeine on this test was higher in CYP1A2 AA homozygotes than in C-allele carriers. In the remaining variables, there were no genotype x treatment interactions for CYP1A2 or for ADORA2A. As a whole group, caffeine increased CMJ height, performance in the sprint velocity test, and ball throwing velocity from 9 m (2.8-4.3%, p = 0.001-0.022, effect size = 0.17-0.31). Thus, pre-exercise caffeine supplementation at a dose of 3 mg·kg-1·bm can be considered as an ergogenic strategy to enhance some neuromuscular aspects of handball performance in professional handball players with low daily caffeine consumption. However, the ergogenic response to acute caffeine intake was not modulated by CYP1A2 or ADORA2A genotypes.",

      "abstract": "Handball is one of the most popular team sports in Germany. In the diagnosis and treatment of shoulder injuries and shoulder complaints, a distinction must be made between sports-specific adaptation over many years and supposed decompensation. In contrast to throwing sports such as baseball or javelin, intended movement sequences in handball are often disrupted suddenly and abruptly by simultaneous contact with an opponent. This can result in a potential for further injuries. There is usually a gradual transition from a physiologically adapted handball shoulder to a pathological throwing shoulder requiring therapy. A throwing shoulder is characterised by a limitation of performance caused by pain in the shoulder during repeated sports-specific stress. In addition to a thorough clinical examination, MRI is the preferred method of examination due to the fact that changes in a handball shoulder are reflected in muscular tissue, tendons and bone in the form of overstrain reactions (bone bruise). Patients should not only take a break from sports and receive adequate pain treatment, but also undergo a specific physiotherapy regimen. MRI results should always be interpreted in due consideration of symptoms and clinical examination results. Surgery is indicated if there is a lack of improvement after specific pain treatment and physiotherapy, or structural damage corresponding to the symptoms without a chance of recovery or with a higher probability of symptoms and function improving in response to surgery. After surgical treatment, the subsequent rehabilitation plays a major role. Depending on the injury, up to 90 % of the patients may be able to return to sports.",

Recent epidemiologic studies, which take the characteristics of handball into account, demonstrate a clear picture of injury patterns and injury risks for handball athletes. While more than half of all athletes can continue playing handball after medical treatment, the other half of injuries is accompanied by loss of training and match time. Although the sustained injuries are associated with a contact mechanism, they are not related to a high rate of foul play in the league setting. This shows that there is a high potential for prevention. Handball medicine strongly aims to primarily reduce and thus prevent injuries in this sport. The existing evidence for the potential of prevention of severe knee injuries must now be implemented into daily training. Due to the high prevalence of overuse injuries to the throwing shoulder, here, too, the first insights have been implemented in a prevention programme. This is described in detail in this article.",

The study included 16 handball players aged 16-24 years (20.26 ± 2.86 years). Every morning before training, players received 30 mL of liquid chokeberry extract for 12 weeks during the regular competition season. The research consisted of morphofunctional and biochemical testing, which was performed at three points (at the beginning of the study and at 6 and 12 weeks after extract consumption). After the chokeberry extract treatment, we observed significant changes in three main aspects. The 12 week supplementation with chokeberry extract decreased the levels of prooxidants (TBARS and nitrites) and increased catalase activity. Analyzing the dynamic of body composition showed a decrease in body fat (9.4 ± 0.5 vs. 7.3 ± 0.6 kg) as well as its percent in a body (11.4 ± 0.4% vs. 8.8 ± 0.4%). On the other hand, the analysis showed an increase of high-density lipoprotein (1.3 ± 0.3 vs. 1.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L) and hemoglobin (144.4 ± 11.7 vs. 151.7 ± 9.9 g/L) after 6 weeks of treatment. At the same time, a decrease in leukocytes (7.2 × 109 ± 2.8 vs. 6.5 ± 1.2 × 109/L) and an increase in red blood cells count (4.9 ± 0.4 × 109 vs. 5.5 ± 0.5 × 109/L) were observed. Overall, these results emphatically show that the use of chokeberry extract dietary supplement induced a wide range of beneficial effects in the examined group of athletes.",

METHODS: Thirteen elite handball athletes (aged 22.9 ± 2.7 years) and 13 sedentary controls (aged 20.9 ± 2.8 years) were included. Three timepoints were established: T0 (baseline conditions); T8 (after 8 weeks of supplementation with a multivitamin/mineral complex); and T16 (after 8 weeks in the absence of supplementation). The expressions of a total 112 of genes were evaluated by RT-qPCR analysis with the QuantStudioTM 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System. RESULTS: The analysis revealed different gene regulation profiles of genes implicated in cell communication, cell energy metabolism, inflammation and the immune system, oxidative stress and muscle function in athletes compared to sedentary controls under resting conditions (upregulated genes: effect size = large, ƞ2 = 1.011 to 1.398, p < 0.05; downregulated genes: effect size = large, ƞ2 = 0.846 and 1.070, p < 0.05, respectively). The nutritional intervention encouraged gene upregulation in elite athletes (p < 0.05). In a follow-up investigation, the IRAK1, CD81, ITGB1, ACADS PDHA2 and GPX1 genes were downregulated in athletes, with a moderate main effect for time-by-group interaction (ηP2 = 0.099 to 0.133; p < 0.05). Additionally, nutritional genes such as MTHFR and THTPA revealed a moderate effect over all the timepoints and group interaction in the study (ηP2 = 0.070 to 0.092; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Elite handball athletes showed a different expression profile in reference to key genes implicated in several sports performance-related functions compared to the sedentary controls, in addition to modulation of gene expression after multivitamin/mineral supplementation.",

METHODS: A team of experienced players was divided randomly between three groups, undertaking a standard in-season regimen (C, n = 10), or supplementing this regimen by plyometric training on sand (PS, n = 11) or a stable surface (P, n = 10) for 7 weeks. Assessments included 20 m sprint times, change of direction tests (Modified change-of-direction T-test and Modified Illinois test), a repeated sprint T-test, jumping ability (squat, countermovement and five jump tests), and static and dynamic balance. RESULTS: After the intervention, PS showed significant increases of sprint speed relative to P and C. Change of direction scores were also improved for PS relative to P and C. Both PS and P increased vertical jump performance (squat jump, p = 0.005; ES = 0.170; counter-movement jump p < 0.001; ES = 0.247). Repeated sprint T-test scores improved in PS and P relative to C, with best times of PS > P (p < 0.05). Both plyometric groups improved their dynamic balance (p < 0.05), with three parameters of PS and only one of P being significantly greater than C. Static balance was also enhanced in both experimental groups (PS > P). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that for reasons that remain to be clarified, several performance measures in adolescent male handball players were increased more by 7 weeks of PS than by P."

However, player compliance to the program remains a challenge, with feedback from players that the program is too time consuming. AIM: To develop a more efficient program, we aimed to assess the effect of the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center shoulder injury prevention program on external rotation (ER) strength and internal rotation (IR) range of motion (ROM), considered to represent key risk factors for injury. METHODS: Four youth handball teams (three females, one males, 57 players, mean age 17.1 years) were randomized to an intervention or control group. The intervention program was conducted three times per week as a part of handball warm-up for 18 weeks, supervised by physical therapists. The main outcome variables were the between-group differences in ER strength and IR ROM change from baseline to postintervention. Isometric ER strength was measured with a handheld dynamometer and IR ROM with a digital goniometer. RESULTS: Mean dominant shoulder isometric ER strength increased both in the intervention (10%) and the control group (6%) during the intervention, but there was no significant group by time interaction (group difference: 0.06 N/kg (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.17). IR ROM did not change in either group during the intervention. CONCLUSION: The Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center shoulder injury prevention program did not affect the risk factors ER strength and IR ROM. The preventive effect of the program must therefore be due to other factors.",

Measures were taken in all the players before and after the intensive training (IT) and tapering (TP) phases in an intervention study. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with the CKD-EPI 4-level race formula, the fractional excretions of sodium (FeNa) and potassium (FeK), the urine potassium-to-sodium ratio (Na/K urine), and the hemoglobin rate [Hb] were determined for all participants. At the end of IT, eGFR and FeNa increased, respectively, by 22.39% (P < 0.01) and 143.85% (P < 0.01), but the variation of FeK is not significant (P > 0.05). The number of abnormally low eGFR values (<90 mL/min/1.73 m2) was reduced from 11 to 5 (P < 0.05). At the end of TP, the eGFR and urine Na-to-K ratio remained on average constant (P > 0.05) but FeNa decreased by 96.32% (P < 0.001) and FeK increased by 144.41% (P < 0.001). The [Hb] rate increased by 9.80% (P < 0.001), and players had inadequate hydration practice. The results suggested that in addition to its already known effects, TP preserves the positive effects of IT on glomerular function in athletes preparing for a competition that presents a major challenge."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 12 weeks of circuit training on physical fitness in handball players. Subjects were randomly divided into a circuit strength training group (CT, n = 10) and a control group (CG, n = 9). Training sessions and matches were performed together, but during the 12-week intervention, the experimental group replaced part of the regular regimen with circuit strength training. Measures assessed in both groups before and after the intervention included: the agility T-half Test, the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test, squat and counter-movement jumps, 15 m and 30 m sprints, and strength tests for the bench press, pull over, and the half squat. The upper limb bench press and pull-over tests along with the lower limb back half squat were performed using a 1-repetition maximum protocol. Based on the intraclass correlation coefficient and excluding the agility T-test (ICC = 0.72), we found excellent relative reliability for all variables (intraclass correlation coefficient range: 0.85-0.96, SEM range: 0.03-3.00). For absolute reliability or coefficients of variation, 71% (5/7) of the variables were excellent (CV < 5%). The circuit strength training group showed significant interaction effects and relevant effect sizes for the 12-week training period (8/9, 89%), and the mean effect size for the CT was markedly higher (d = 1.3, range: 0.41 - 2.76) than in the CG (d = - 1.0, range: -0.73 - 0.29). The largest improvements were in the Yo-Yo test (d = 2.76) and the squat jump (d = 2.05). These results show that a 12-week circuit strength training program is an effective method to increase handball-related performance characteristics."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Youth handball players are vulnerable to injuries. Because there is no available injury prevention training specifically developed for youth handball players targeting both upper and lower limbs or incorporating psychological aspects of injury, we undertook the 'Implementing injury Prevention training ROutines in TEams and Clubs in youth Team handball (I-PROTECT)' project. We used an ecological participatory design incorporating the perspectives of multiple stakeholders (health beneficiaries, programme deliverers and policy makers). The aim of this paper was to describe the process of developing the I-PROTECT model, featuring injury prevention training and an accompanying implementation strategy. DESIGN: We used the generalisable six-step intervention development process, outlined to guide researchers when developing implementable, evidence-based sports injury prevention interventions, to develop the I-PROTECT model. The six-step process involves establishing a research-stakeholder collaborative partnership to (1) identify and synthesise research evidence and clinical experience; (2) consult with relevant experts; (3) engage end users to ensure their needs, capacity and values are considered; (4) test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention; (5) evaluate the intervention against theory; and (6) obtain feedback from early implementers. Two community handball clubs in southern Sweden, offering organised training for youth male and female players, and the district handball federation, participate in the intervention development. Drafts of the I-PROTECT model will be developed and revised with key stakeholder advice and input throughout all six steps. CONCLUSION: The I-PROTECT model described will be an end user-driven intervention, including evidence-based, theory-informed and context-specific injury prevention training for youth handball, and an associated implementation strategy.",

A three-dimensional back scanner and a pressure measuring plate were used. Shoulder injuries cause a differing scapular height and increase the vertebrae rotation in correlation to playing years. Lower limb injuries lead to a decrease on the Centre of Pressure (CoP) with growing game experience. Wing players show the lowest injury risk. Lower limb and shoulder girdle are mostly affected regarding the incidence of injuries. Pivot players suffer most injuries in the lower limb area (59%), whereas wing players mostly have shoulder injuries (19%). Being injured, 21% of the players continue playing, 79% pause for a minimum of six months (25%). No correlation can be determined between level of profession, use of NSAIDs and body posture or postural control. Playing position, employment situation or NSAIDs have no influence on type of injury, body posture or postural control. While shoulder injuries can be recognized in the vertebrae area, lower limb injuries can affect the CoP.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that participation in small-sided team handball training could provide beneficial effects on cardiovascular and metabolic parameters in overweight premenopausal women with special focus on the importance of prior team handball experience. METHODS: A 16-week RCT training intervention was conducted in overweight premenopausal women randomized into three groups: a team handball training group without prior experience (UN; n = 13), a team handball group with prior experience (EXP; n = 10), and an inactive control group (CON; n = 9). Both UN and EXP completed 1.6 ± 0.3 training sessions per week with average heart rates of 84 ± 5 and 85 ± 9% of maximal heart rate, respectively. Cardiovascular and metabolic parameters were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Compared to CON, UN had significant increases in VO2max  (7 ± 4%) and intermittent endurance performance (26 ± 14%) as well as reduced total fat mass (4 ± 6%), total fat percentage (4 ± 5%), and android fat mass (7 ± 12%), respectively (all P < .05). Compared to UN and CON, EXP displayed increased left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index (both P < .05) after the training period. There were no significant changes between any of the groups in muscle mass, blood lipids, resting heart rate, and blood pressure (all P > .05). CONCLUSION: Small-sided team handball training in overweight premenopausal women resulted in improvement of VO2max and body composition for participants with minimal team handball experience, indicating that prior team handball experience is not a prerequisite for improving physiological parameters of importance for health. Furthermore, EXP displayed cardiac adaptations, including increased left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:  The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of combined resistance training including handball-specific drill (CRT) with resistance training excluding handball-specific drill training (NSDT). MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Twenty-two male handball players who studied physical education were randomly assigned to two groups: CRT (combined resistance training with sport-specific drill; n = 12) and NSDT (resistance training without any sport-specific drill training; n = 10). Over a 10-week period during the competitive season, the players performed a specific training program twice per week, which replaced their normal team handball training. The CRT regimen consisted of a combined (associated) resistance training and handball-specific drill, whereas the NSDT program consisted of a resistance training without handball-specific drill (dissociated). Pre- and post-test measures included squat jump and countermovement jumps, bench press, back half squats, throwing velocity during a 3-step jump throw, and a jump shot, repeated-sprint ability (six 2 × 15-m shuttle sprints) (RSA), medicine ball throw and anthropometric measurements. RESULTS:  In both groups, significant intervention effects (d ≥ 1.0) were seen for all sprint (3/3), throwing (3/3) and jump (2/2) measures. Regarding maximal strength parameters, an effect size lower than 0.5 was only detected in the NSDT group for half back squats (d = 0.48). The largest effects were observed in the NSDT group for squat jump (d = 6.20) and medicine ball throw (d = 6.07). Interaction effects (group × time) were found for 50 % (5/10) of parameters. The greatest difference between groups regarding performance development over time was detected for jump shot (interaction effect: η² = 0.748). In contrast, there was no difference in performance development in both groups over time for RSAbest (interaction effect: η² = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS:  The current findings suggest that during the competitive season, 10 weeks of CRT with only two training sessions per week improved numerous measures of athletic performance in handball students of physical education. Such conditioning should be highly recommended as part of the annual training program of handball players.",

All captains and coaches of 44 elite handball teams (22 male and 22 female) constituting the intervention (21 teams) and control arm (n = 23 teams) in the trial were invited to take part in a survey. A questionnaire, based on the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework, addressing the end user perspective on risk factors and prevention of shoulder injuries, as well as key issues related to the application of the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Shoulder Injury Prevention Programme, was distributed using electronic survey software. The response rate was 100%. Overall, the majority of coaches (84%) and captains (89%) believed that handball players are at high risk for shoulder injuries. All delivery agents in the trial reported to be familiar with the exercise program and the majority believed in a preventative effect (coaches 90% and captains 81%). Only a minority reported full compliance with the recommended frequency (coaches 29%, captains 14%), with program being too time-consuming (coaches 67%, captains 81%) and lack of player motivation (coaches 76%, captains 62%) as the main barriers. Our results suggest that there is fertile ground for implementation of the OSTRC Shoulder Injury Prevention Programme in elite handball, with program length and lack of player motivation as the main barriers to overcome.",

For this reason, a polar coordinates analysis was carried out, by gender, using as focal behaviors the simple and double goal, and the loss of possession of the attacking team, which are considered decisive in assessing the success of the decisions at the end of the positional attack. These focal behaviors have been linked to criteria that characterize the attack situation such as the minute, the score, the numerical balance, the defensive system and the duration. A total of 24 sessions were observed with the HOISAN computer software, using an ad hoc designed tool. The model of observation used was punctual, multidimensional, and nomothetic. The observation unit used for the positional attack from when the specialist gains control of play until the possession changes. The results obtained showed that an advantage of goals scored and the numerical balance situations of the teams modulate significantly the appropriate decision made by both categories. However, they also indicated differences in the flow of pairing behaviors for both categories in some aspects. Specifically, it has been observed that a longer duration of the attack in the female category has been linked significantly to a successful performance and the results also show that an elaborated attack is related to successful behaviors. In the male category, it has been observed that the technical fouls made by the attackers increase in the last minutes of the match. Likewise, as regards the to the opposing team's defensive system, the results in the male category are related to successful behaviors before any of them; whereas, in the female category, when playing against a defensive pressure system, the results relate more to errors during the performance of the pass and reception. The use of polar coordinates for the estimation of technical-tactical relations allows, from a psychological point of view, determine the techniques and procedures of psychological intervention that optimize the action resources of the players individually and the team as a collective."

METHODS: Participants were allocated to an experimental group (EG; n = 10; age: 15.9 [0.2] y) and a control group (CG; n = 9; age: 15.9 [0.3] y). The EG performed NHE (2-3 sessions/wk) in replacement of some handball-specific drills, whereas the CG followed regular handball training. Pretraining and posttraining tests were carried out for the assessment of sprint speed (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m), jump performance (countermovement jump [CMJ] height), change-of-direction (t test), and repeated-sprint ability (RSA total time [RSAtotal], RSA best time [RSAbest], and RSA fatigue index [RSAFI]). Data were analyzed using magnitude-based inferences. RESULTS: Within-group analyses for the EG showed moderate performance improvements for 5, 10, and 20 m (effect size [ES] = 0.68-0.82), t test (ES = 0.74), and CMJ (ES = 0.85). Trivial to small improvements were observed for RSA (ES = -0.06 to 0.35). For the CG, within-group outcomes showed performance decrements with moderate (t test [ES = 0.71]), small (5 m [ES = 0.46] and RSAbest [ES = 0.20]), and trivial magnitude (10 m [ES = 0.10], 20 m [ES = 0.16], and RSAtotal [ES = 0.00]). Furthermore, trivial to small performance improvements were found for CMJ (ES = 0.10) and RSAFI (ES = 0.5). Between-group analyses revealed small to large effects in favor of EG for 5 m (ES = 1.07), 10 m (ES = 0.66), 20 m (ES = 0.53), t test (ES = 1.38), and RSA (ES = 0.68-0.78). A trivial between-group difference was demonstrated for CMJ (ES = -0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The NHE training intervention, in replacement of some handball-specific drills, was more effective than regular handball training in improving physical performance (ie, linear sprint time, jumping, change-of-direction, and RSA) in young female handball players."

Effects of short-term in-season weightlifting training on the muscle strength, peak power, sprint performance, and ball-throwing velocity of male handball players. J Strength Cond Res 33(12): 3309-3321, 2019-This study analyzed the effects of in-season weightlifting training, conducted biweekly for 12 weeks. Twenty-two male handball players were divided into experimental (age: 20.3 ± 0.5 years, height: 1.85 ± 0.04 m, and body mass: 86.3 ± 9.4 kg) and control (age: 20.1 ± 0.5 years, height: 1.81 ± 0.05 m, and body mass: 83.9 ± 10.3 kg) groups, and performance was assessed before and after the intervention. Peak power was determined by a cycle ergometer force-velocity test, a vertical squat jump, and a countermovement jump. Measures of 1 repetition maximal strength included bench press, back half-squats, snatch, and clean and jerk. Handball-throwing velocity was assessed by standing, running, and jump throws. The change of direction T-half test and sprint times over 5, 15, and 30 m were recorded by paired photocells. The intraclass correlation coefficient of all parameters exceeded 0.75. Significant training effects were seen for all sprint (3/3) and throwing (3/3) measures, but only 7/14 strength parameters and 3/10 jump parameters. The largest increases of performance were for snatch (η = 0.627; d = 2.85) and 15-m sprinting (η = 0.852; d = 2.73). Countermovement jump force showed a negative response (d = -0.62). Three other parameters (V0 power for the upper and lower limbs, countermovement jump power) showed only small effect sizes (d = 0.45, d = 0.31, and d = 0.23, respectively). We conclude that 12 weeks of biweekly in-season weight training improved the peak power, maximal strength, sprinting, and throwing in handball players, but that their jump performance did not increase with this kind of intervention.",

However, there is only a single study examining stretch-induced performance changes with youth at 24 hours' post-stretch. The objective of this study was to examine physiological responses of young trained athletes at 24-hours after experiencing SS or DS protocols. Eight young male, elite handball players (age: 16.1±5.1 years) were tested prior to-, 3-minutes and 24-hours following the three conditions (DS, SS, Control) in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Similar volumes of SS (2 repetitions of 75s for each leg) and DS (5 repetitions of 30s for each leg) involved one stretch each for the quadriceps and hamstrings. Tests included (i) two 4s maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC) at 60° of knee flexion with 2-min rest, (ii) two maximal isokinetic contractions each at 60°/sec and 300°/sec with 1-min rest, and (iii) two drop jumps with 30-sec rest. To simulate a full warm-up, dynamic activity including 5 minutes of aerobic cycling (70 rpm; 1 kilopond), 4 submaximal isometric contractions and 4 drop jumps were instituted before the pre-tests and following the interventions. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that 1) both the SS and control conditions exhibited knee extensor 60°.s-1 (SS:-10.3%; p = 0.04, Control: -8.7%; p = 0.07) and 300°.s-1 (SS: -12.9%; p = 0.005, Control: -16.3%; p = 0.02) isokinetic deficits at post-test, 2) DS impaired knee flexor 60°.s-1 isokinetic work and power-related measures at post-test (Work: -10.1%; p = 0.0006; Power: -19.1%; p = 0.08) and at 24-hours' post-test (Work: 9.9%; p = 0.023; Power: -9.6%; p = 0.01), 3) DS (12.07% and 10.47%) and SS (13.7% and 14.6%) enhanced knee flexor 300°.s-1 isokinetic force and power-related measures compared to control. In conclusion, testing-induced knee extensor isokinetic impairments were counterbalanced by DS, however the hip flexion DS could have produced minor muscle damage for at least 24-hours decreasing knee flexor forces and power at 60°.s-1.",

METHODS: Twenty female handball players (23.4±4.4 years, 168.4±3.5 cm, and 66.9±9.2 kg) were randomized into a CST intervention group (N.=10) and a control group (CON, N.=10). Throwing velocity, maximal isometric strength (MIS) and endurance strength of the ventral, dorsal and lateral core muscle chains were measured before and after progressive, six-week core stability training in the CST group. RESULTS: Core endurance of both lateral core muscle chains (LR: F=7.03, P=0.017; LL: F=6.31, P=0.022;) and MIS of the left lateral core muscle chain (LL: F=7.08, P=0.019) was significantly improved in CST compared to CON group after 6 weeks. Additionally, CST group significantly increased MIS of the lateral right core muscles (21%, P=0.042) and the ventral core endurance (35%, P=0.016) compared to baseline. Although both groups significantly increased throwing velocity of the jump throw after the intervention (CST 12%, P=0.001; CON 8%, P=0.009), throwing velocity of the standing throw remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: A six-week CST intervention effectively increased the isometric strength and endurance of selected core muscles but did not significantly enhance throwing velocity compared to standard training.",

Twenty-five young athletes (age = 18.6 ± 2.4 years) from an elite high school national level Brazilian Handball team were randomized into two study groups: SC/Jamelon nectar (SC, n = 12) and placebo (n = 13). The subjects ingested 10 mL/kg/day of Jamelon nectar or placebo 30 min before the training sessions and immediately after training cessation, for 28 days. Body mass index (BMI) and percentage of fat mass were assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured by lipid peroxidation, which was quantified by malondialdehyde (MDA). Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), creatine kinase (CK) activity, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined. The 20 m shuttle run test, vertical jump, and running anaerobic sprint test were assessed to verify performance and the fatigue index was calculated. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire was used for psychological evaluation. Both groups demonstrated improved vertical jump performance and a decreased fatigue index over time but without significant differences between them regarding performance. There was statistically significance only for SC in CK, LDH, and MDA, and TAC was greater in the SC compared to placebo. Furthermore, only the SC group demonstrated improved mood disturbance and confusion after the intervention. In conclusion, the present study suggests that SC nectar supplementation reduced biomarkers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, and improved psychological response in young handball players."

      "abstract": "Slackline training has been shown to improve balance and neuromuscular performance. However, recent studies suggested that balance is task-specific, implying that transferability of balance skills is limited and might depend on the similarity of the tasks. This study therefore investigated if short-term slackline training could improve performance in balance tasks that are either more or less similar to the trained slackline task. Furthermore, we assessed potential transfer effects to other neuromuscular performance tests. 25 female handball players (23.7 ± 3.9 years) participated in our study and were matched to either a slackline training (SLT; n = 14) or a control group (CON; n = 11). The intervention comprised 12 sessions with overall 120 minutes of slackline training using single and double slacklines. Slackline standing time and measures of dynamic and static balance were assessed before and after the intervention, as well as power and sprint-related performance parameters. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA found a significant group × time interaction for slackline standing time, indicating larger training effects for SLT. For the remaining dynamic and static balance tests, no significant interactions were found. With regard to neuromuscular performance, there was a significant group × time interaction only in change of direction. In essence, the study showed that slackline training induced task-specific balance improvements without affecting general balance. This adds further evidence to the task-specificity principle of balance, although the specificity of the sample as well as the briefness of the intervention should be taken into account when generalizing our findings. Nonetheless, this study contains practical implications for team sports interventions and future balance training studies, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate balance exercises to yield rapid and the desired training outcomes.",

METHODS: Twenty-eight untrained 20- to 30-year-old women were randomized to a handball training group (HG; n = 14, height 170 ± 5 cm, weight 73 ± 11 kg, VO2peak 37.7 ± 4.1 mL/min/kg) that trained 1.7 ± 0.3 times per week over 12 weeks (70 min 4 v 4 handball sessions) or an inactive control group (CG; n = 14, 169 ± 5 cm, 71 ± 12 kg, 38.1 ± 3.7 mL/min/kg). Physiological and psychological and motivational training adaptations were assessed pre- and post-intervention by dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans, blood sampling, physical tests, and questionnaires. RESULTS: The average heart rate (HR) over all training sessions was equal to 85% ± 6% HRmax. Between-group intervention effects were observed in favor of HG for muscle mass (2.1%, p = 0.024), proximal femur bone mineral density (0.8%, p = 0.041), Yo-Yo IE1 intermittent endurance test level 1 (IE1) performance (35%, p < 0.001), and incremental treadmill test performance (11.5%, p = 0.003), but not total fat mass (p = 0.176), mean arterial blood pressure (p = 0.328), resting HR (p = 0.219), or blood lipids (p = 0.298-0.854). In CG, no changes were observed in any of the measured physiological variables after the training period. Compared to CG, HG had an increase in intrinsic motivation (p < 0.001) and in the well-being subscale \"energy\" (p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Participation in regular recreational team handball training organized as small-sided games has marked beneficial effects on physical performance, musculoskeletal fitness, well-being, and motivation in untrained young women."

The aim of this ecological participatory study was to identify facilitators, among stakeholders at multiple levels, that could help injury prevention training become part of regular training routines in youth team handball. Concept mapping, a mixed-method approach for qualitative data collection and quantitative data analysis, was used. Stakeholders (n = 196) of two community team handball clubs (29% players, 13% coaches, 38% caregivers, 11% club, district and national handball administrators, 9% unknown) participated in a brainstorming process. After the research team synthesized the 235 generated statements, 50 stakeholders (34% players, 22% coaches, 24% caregivers, 20% administrators) sorted 89 unique facilitator statements into clusters and rated them for importance and feasibility. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis yielded five clusters (stress value 0.231): \"Understanding and applying knowledge,\" \"Education, knowledge, and consistency,\" \"Set-up and exercises,\" \"Inspiration, motivation, and routines,\" and \"Club policy and expert collaboration.\" The cluster \"Understanding and applying knowledge\" had the highest mean importance (3.17 out of 4) and feasibility (2.93) ratings. The 32 statements rated as both highly important and feasible (Go-zone) indicate action is required at the individual (end-users) and organizational (policymakers) levels to implement injury prevention training. Results suggest that developing evidence-based context-specific injury prevention training, incorporating physiological, biomechanical and psychological components, and an associated context-specific implementation plan in partnership with all stakeholders should be a high priority to facilitate the implementation of injury prevention training in youth team handball.",

Twenty-six young male handball players were divided into two sub-groups to perform a five-week pre-season training programme supplemented with two ground-reactive protocols with an equal number of jumping exercises referred as to ground contacts: plyometric training (PLY; n = 14) and standard jump training (CON; n = 12). Before and after training, repeated sprint ability (RSA), jumping ability (JA), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and aerobic power at the anaerobic threshold (PAT) were measured. A two-factor analysis revealed significant time effects with improvements in fat mass (p = 0.012), maximal power during the incremental cycling test (p = 0.001) and PAT (p < 0.001), power decline (PDEC) and maximal power (Pmax) in the 5th repetition (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). The training-induced changes in absolute and relative peak power in the RSA test and absolute VO2max approached significance (p = 0.06, p = 0.053 and p = 0.06). No intervention time × exercise protocol effects were observed for any indices of JA, RSA and aerobic capacity. A five-week pre-season conditioning programme supplemented with only 15 sessions of plyometric exercise did not induce any additional benefits, compared to a matched format of standard jump training, in terms of improving jumping performance and maximal power in the RSA test. Aerobic capacity and the fatigue index in RSA were maintained under these two training conditions."

The emergence of regularities or certain patterns of play can be explained by the location of matches. Through an observational methodology and a nomothetic, monitoring and multidimensional design, thirty-nine European elite handball matches were selected (N = 39). A mixed 'ad hoc' registration system was designed. Records were made of the last three minutes of home and visiting games of which images were available. Two observers with observational methodology experience participated in the study. The quality of the records was dealt with in an intraobserver and interobserver way. Two different techniques were applied for the treatment of the data: a) detection of behavioral patterns by Theme (p < .005) (Magnusson, 2000) and b) Chaid decision trees (p < .05) using SPSSv.24. The results showed the existence of T-patterns according to the location (different T-patterns: home: 1085; away: 1242) of the matches. The categories most involved in effective launches were unveiled. On the other hand, the Chaid model also showed the effect of location (p < .001): home-win (node 9) (n = 149, 69%), away-win (node 10) (n = 15, 16%) in handball. Crossing analysis offered enriched interpretations to advance in the home advantage concept. From this study, guidelines can be drawn that may help handball coaches to build training tasks as differences in behavioral patterns between home or away play in handball were identified. Thus, designing tasks considering a match location has requires specificity."

Effects of an 8-week in-season elastic band training program on explosive muscle performance, change of direction, and repeated changes of direction in the lower limbs of junior male handball players. J Strength Cond Res 33(7): 1804-1815, 2019-The aim of this study was to examine the effects of incorporating 8 weeks of biweekly lower-limb elastic band training (knee and hip extension) into the in-season regimen of junior handball players. Study participants (30 men, aged 18.7 ± 0.8 years, body mass 81.1 ± 15.4 kg, height 1.82 ± 0.06 m, body fat: 15.5 ± 5.2%) were randomly assigned between control and experimental groups. Measures obtained before and after intervention included a cycle ergometer force-velocity test, force platform determinations of squat and countermovement jump characteristics, sprint times (5 and 30 m), repeated change-of-direction (RCOD) and change-of-direction (T-half, COD) tests, 1 repetition maximum (RM) half back squat, and anthropometric estimates of limb muscle volumes. Small to trivial improvements of experimental subjects relative to control subjects included peak power (p < 0.001), 1RM strength measures (p < 0.01), sprint times (p < 0.001 for 5 m; p < 0.05 for 30 m), COD (p < 0.01), and all RCOD parameters (p < 0.05) except the RCOD fatigue index. However, vertical jump parameters and limb volumes remained unchanged relative to controls. It may be concluded that adding biweekly elastic band training to a standard conditioning regimen yields small gains in measures that likely have an important influence on handball performance, particularly the ability to sprint, change direction, and make repeated changes of direction. Accordingly, such simple exercises can usefully be adopted as a component of handball training.",

In this study, 16 elite female handball players participated, whose body compositions were measured and took two vita maxima tests. During the analysis, each cardiorespiratory parameter was monitored for every 20 s. Between the two examinations, 6 weeks passed and an intervention took place. There was a significant decrease in relative body fat and a significant increase in relative muscle mass. Remarkable positive changes occurred in the values of ventilation, oxygen pulse, and in both absolute and relative aerobic capacities as well. The mean values of the team developed as expected, but the individual changes in body composition and cardiorespiratory parameters are just as important.

RESULTS: The intervention yielded increases in sprint (10 m 11.7%), change-of-direction performance (T-half 5.1%, modified Illinois 4.2%), jumping (squat P < .01, 19%; countermovement P < .01, 20.3%; countermovement aimed arms P < .01, 19.3%; 5-jump P < .05, 15.2%), and 1 of 4 repeated-sprint scores (best time P < .05, 5.9%). However, repeated-sprint T-test and balance scores were unchanged. CONCLUSION: Complex strength training develops abilities important to handball performance.",

      "abstract": "Muscular strength and speed are critical physical factors in determining the technical and tactical skills of elite team handball players. This study thus investigated the effect of high-intensity muscular strength and sprint interval training (SIT) on lower limb explosive performance and anthropometric characteristics in 22 male handball athletes aged 20.2 ± 0.1 years. A training group (TG, n = 12) and a control group (CG, n = 10) were followed over 8 weeks parallel to regular handball training. The TG received combined additional high-intensity muscular strength and interval training twice per week during this period. The muscular training was comprised of 3 - 4 sets of 70 - 85 % of 1-RM (repetition maximum) of dynamic back half squat exercise; followed immediately by a short sprint program with 4, 5, and 6 maximal intensity repetitions of 30 m runs. Strength (1-RM of the half back-squat and bench press), first step (V1S), first 5 m (V5 m), squat jumps (SJ), counter movement jumps (CMJ) and the Modified Agility Test (MAT) were tested at the beginning and end of the study. Significant interaction effects (group × time) were observed for all parameters (η² range: 0.531 (MAT) to 0.829 (First 5 m)). All 10 parameters showed relevant intervention effects (d> 0.5) in the TG (highest intervention effect: CMJ: d = 4.05), the mean effect size being d = 1.85. In contrast, scores for the CG either remained unchanged or decreased (d = -0.24). We conclude that combined high-intensity strength and sprint interval training during the competitive season should be recommended to elite male handball players as a means of improving handball-related performance characteristics without compromising other critical aspects of the individual's performance.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Team handball is associated with a high risk of severe knee injury that needs to be reduced, particularly at the youth level. The purpose of this study was to show how an injury-prevention programme effectively reduces severe knee injury in adolescent team handball players. METHODS: Of 23 adolescent handball teams of both sexes, 13 were randomly allocated into the intervention group (168 players) and 10 into the control group (111 players). Players of the intervention group regularly participated in an injury-prevention programme for one season. Handball exposure and sustained injuries were documented for both groups on a monthly basis. The primary outcome parameter of the injury-prevention programme was the incidence of severe knee injury. RESULTS: Of the 279 included players, 68 (24%) sustained 82 injuries yielding an overall incidence of 1.85 injuries per 1000 h handball exposure (intervention group: 50 injuries/incidence: 1.90/1000 h; control group: 32 injuries/incidence: 1.78/1000 h). Knee injury was the second most frequent injury in adolescent team handball. The primary outcome parameter, severe knee injury occurred significantly more often in the control group [mean age (SD) 15.1 (1.0), injury incidence 0.33/1000 h] than in the intervention group [mean age (SD) 14.9 (0.9), injury incidence 0.04/1000 h]. The odds ratio was 0.11 (95% CI 0.01-0.90), p = 0.019. Other injuries to the lower extremities showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent neuromuscular exercises prevent severe knee injury in adolescent team handball players and should thus be included in the practical routine as well as in the education of team coaches.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT:   In team handball, an anterior cruciate ligament injury often occurs during landing after a jump shot. Many intervention programs try to reduce the injury rate by instructing athletes to land more safely. Video is an effective way to provide feedback, but little is known about its influence on landing technique in sport-specific situations. OBJECTIVE:   To test the effectiveness of a video-overlay feedback method on landing technique in elite handball players. DESIGN:   Controlled laboratory study. SETTING:   Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:   A total of 16 elite female handball players assigned to a control group (n = 8; age = 17.61 ± 1.34 years, height = 1.73 ± 0.06 m, mass = 69.55 ± 4.29 kg) or video group (n = 8; age = 17.81 ± 0.86 years, height = 1.71 ± 0.03 m, mass = 64.28 ± 6.29 kg). INTERVENTION(S):   Both groups performed jump shots in a pretest, 2 training sessions, and a posttest. The video group received video feedback of an expert model with an overlay of their own jump shots in training sessions 1 and 2, whereas the control group did not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):   We measured ankle, knee, and hip angles in the sagittal plane at initial contact and peak flexion; range of motion; and Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) scores. One 2 × 4 repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to analyze the group, time, and interaction effects of all kinematic outcome measures and the LESS score. RESULTS:   The video group improved knee and hip flexion at initial contact and peak flexion and range of motion. In addition, the group's average peak ankle flexion (12.0° at pretest to 21.8° at posttest) and LESS score (8.1 pretest to 4.0 posttest) improved. When we considered performance variables, no differences between groups were found in shot accuracy or vertical jump height, whereas horizontal jump distance in the video group increased over time. CONCLUSIONS:   Overlay visual feedback is an effective method for improving landing kinematics during a sport-specific jump shot. Further research is warranted to determine the long-term effects and transfer to training and game situations.",

An increase of throwing velocity of a handball set shot when knowledge of results was provided or not provided during training was compared. Fifty female and seventy-three male physical education students were assigned randomly to the experimental or control group. All participants performed two series of ten set shots with maximal effort twice a week for six weeks. The experimental group received information regarding throwing velocity measured by a radar gun immediately after every shot, whereas the control group did not receive any feedback. Measurements of maximal throwing velocity of an ordinary handball and a heavy ball were performed, before and after the training period and compared. Participants who received feedback on results attained almost a four times greater relative increase of the velocity of the normal ball (size 2) as compared to the same intervention when feedback was not provided (8.1 ± 3.6 vs. 2.7 ± 2.9%). The velocity increases were smaller, but still significant between the groups for throws using the heavy ball (5.1 ± 4.2 and 2.5 ± 5.8 for the experimental and control group, respectively). Apart from the experimental group throwing the normal ball, no differences in velocity change for gender were obtained. The results confirmed that training oriented towards an increase in throwing velocity became significantly more effective when frequent knowledge of results was provided."

This descriptive study examines the acute physical and physiological demands of recreational team handball and evaluates whether it could be suggested as an exercise mode for fitness and health enhancement in 33-55-year-old untrained men. Time-motion, heart rate (HR), and blood lactate analyses were obtained from 4 recreational matches. Mean distance covered during the 60 min matches was 6012 ± 428 m. The players changed match activity 386 ± 70 times, of which high-intensity runs and unorthodox movements amounted to 59 ± 18 and 26 ± 26 per match, respectively. The most frequent highly demanding playing actions were jumps and throws. Match average and peak HR were 82 ± 6% and 93 ± 5%  HRmax, respectively. Players exercised at intensities between 81 and 90%  HRmax for 47% (28 ± 14 min) and >90%  HRmax for 24% (14 ± 15 min) of total match time. Match average and peak blood lactate values were 3.6 ± 1.3 and 4.2 ± 1.2 mM, respectively. Recreational team handball is an intermittent high-intensity exercise mode with physical and physiological demands in the range of those found to have a positive effect on aerobic, anaerobic, and musculoskeletal fitness in adult individuals. Training studies considering recreational team handball as a health enhancing intervention are warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessively high stresses are applied to the shoulder joint of handball players, mainly caused by overhead throwing. Shoulder pain is a significant problem among junior female team handball players and both male and female top-level team handball players in Norway. METHOD: A randomized selection was performed among the best female junior teams (J 16) in the Trøndelag region of Norway in the 2014-2015 season. Three teams were randomized to the intervention group and three teams to the control group. Players in the intervention group (n=53) participated in a seven-month, three-times-a-week shoulder-muscle strength-training program, while those in the control group (n=53) participated in a comparable handball training, but did not conduct any specific strength training during the season. RESULTS: A strength-training program had no effect on the prevention of shoulder pain. Overall, the players reported shoulder pain, but graded the pain low on visual analog scale (VAS). Both the intervention group and the control group reported pain under 1 on VAS at baseline and posttest, and there was no significant difference within or between the groups when it came to the intensity of pain reported on VAS. A significant difference (p<0.048) was found between the groups on the sport-specific part of the quick-Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) form, but it did not fulfill the minimal demand to change and the players scored it low, something that indicates little functional problems when it comes to team handball. The intervention group was significantly stronger (p<0.008) on the push-ups test compared to the control group on the posttest. The intervention group increased the number of push-ups from 3.1 to 6.4, while the control group went from 2.3 to 3.6. Aside from this, there were no significant differences in between the groups. CONCLUSION: A shoulder-strengthening program had no effect on the prevention of shoulder pain among junior female team handball players."

Effects of high-intensity interval training with different interval durations on physical performance in handball players. J Strength Cond Res 32(12): 3398-3406, 2018-The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 2 high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols with different interval durations (short [SI] vs. long [LI]) based on peak running velocity in 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (VIFT) in handball players. Eighteen highly-trained players (age: 22.7 ± 3.9 years; height: 181.5 ± 6.6 cm; body mass: 84.7 ± 14.1 kg) were randomly assigned to SI (2 sets of 22 intervals of 10-second runs at 95% VIFT) or LI (5 sets of 3-minute intervals at 85% VIFT) group. The intervention program had to be carried out 2 times a week over 6 weeks. Before and after training period, 10-m sprint, countermovement jump, repeated sprint ability (RSA), and 30-15IFT were assessed. In the within-group analysis, significant improvements in VIFT were found in SI (8.18%) and LI (8.19%) from pretest to posttest. Players in both SI and LI also showed significant enhancements in RSA average time (effect size [ES] = 0.72 and 0.38, respectively), total time (ES = 0.72 and 0.38, respectively), and percentage of decrement (ES = 1.08 and 0.77, respectively) from pretest to posttest. Percentage changes in VIFT, for both groups combined, had a very large correlation with percentage changes in percentage of decrement of RSA (r = 0.857). In the between-groups, there were no differences between the training groups (SI and LI) in any variable (p > 0.05). These results indicate that both HIIT protocols are effective for fitness development during preseason period in handball players. However, SI should be considered as preferred HIIT method because of its higher specificity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Female handball athletes are at a particular risk of sustaining lower extremity injuries. The study examines time-dependent adaptations of static and dynamic balance as potential injury risk factors to a specific warm-up program focusing on neuromuscular control. METHODS: Fourty one (24.0 ± 5.9 years) female handball athletes were randomized to an intervention or control group. The intervention group implemented a 15-min specific neuromuscular warm-up program, three times per week for eleven weeks, whereas the control group continued with their regular warm-up. Balance was assessed at five time points. Measures included the star excursion balance test (SEBT), and center of pressure (COP) sway velocity during single-leg standing. RESULTS: No baseline differences existed between groups in demographic data. Adherence to neuromuscular warm-up was 88.7 %. Mean COP sway velocity decreased significantly over time in the intervention group (-14.4 %; p < .001), but not in the control group (-6.2 %; p = 0.056). However, these effects did not differ significantly between groups (p = .098). Mean changes over time in the SEBT score were significantly greater (p = .014) in the intervention group (+5.48) compared to the control group (+3.45). Paired t-tests revealed that the first significant balance improvements were observed after 6 weeks of training. CONCLUSIONS: A neuromuscular warm-up positively influences balance variables associated with an increased risk of lower extremity injuries in female handball athletes. The course of adaptations suggests that a training volume of 15 min, three times weekly over at least six weeks produces measurable changes.

OBJECTIVE: To verify the effects of an STP using elastic bands on shoulder muscles and ball-throwing speed. DESIGN: Randomized and prospective controlled trial. SETTING: Exercise physiology laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine female handball players were randomly assigned to an experimental (EG, n = 21, 15.3 ± 1.1 y) or a control (CG, n = 18, 15.0 ± 0.8 y) group.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and after the STP, both groups underwent a ball-throwing-speed test and isokinetic test to assess shoulder internal- (IR) and external-rotator muscle performance. RESULTS: Average power values for IR muscles presented a significant group-vs-time interaction effect (F = 3.9, P = .05); EG presented significantly higher values after the STP (P = .03). Ball speed presented higher values in EG after the STP in standing (P = .04) and jumping (P = .03) throws. IR peak-torque values and balance in shoulder-rotator muscles presented no group-vs-time interaction effect.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shoulder problems are highly prevalent among elite handball players. Reduced glenohumeral rotation, external rotation weakness and scapula dyskinesis have been identified as risk factors. AIM: Evaluate the effect of an exercise programme designed to reduce the prevalence of shoulder problems in elite handball. METHODS: 45 elite handball teams (22 female teams, 23 male teams, 660 players) were cluster randomised (22 teams, 331 players in the intervention group, 23 teams, 329 players in the control group) and followed for 1 competitive season (7 months). The Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Shoulder Injury Prevention Programme, an exercise programme to increase glenohumeral internal rotation, external rotation strength and scapular muscle strength, as well as improve kinetic chain and thoracic mobility, was delivered by coaches and captains 3 times per week as a part of the handball warm-up. The main outcome measures, prevalence of shoulder problems and substantial shoulder problems, were measured monthly. RESULTS: The average prevalence of shoulder problems during the season was 17% (95% CI 16% to 19%) in the intervention group and 23% (95% CI 21% to 26%) in the control group (mean difference 6%). The average prevalence of substantial shoulder problems was 5% (95% CI 4% to 6%) in the intervention group and 8% (95% CI 7% to 9%) in the control group (mean difference 3%). Using generalised estimating equation models, a 28% lower risk of shoulder problems (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98, p=0.038) and 22% lower risk of substantial shoulder problems (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.16, p=0.23) were observed in the intervention group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The OSTRC Shoulder Injury Prevention Programme reduced the prevalence of shoulder problems in elite handball and should be included as a part of the warm-up.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the effect of 4-week unknown vs known loads strength training intervention on power output performance and throwing velocity in junior team handball players. METHODS: Twenty-eight junior team-handball players (17.2 ± 0.6 years, 1.79 ± 0.07 m, 75.6 ± 9.4 kg)were divided into two groups (unknown loads: UL; known loads: KL). Both groups performed two sessions weekly consisting of four sets of six repetitions of the bench press throw exercise, using the 30%, 50% and 70% of subjects' individual 1 repetition maximum (1RM). In each set, two repetitions with each load were performed, but the order of the loads was randomised. In the KL group, researchers told the subjects the load to mobilise prior each repetition, while in the UL group, researchers did not provide any information. Maximal dynamic strength (1RM bench press), power output (with 30, 50 and 70% of 1RM) and throwing velocity (7 m standing throw and 9 m jumping throw) were assessed pre- and post-training intervention. RESULTS: Both UL and KL group improved similarly their 1RM bench press as well as mean and peak power with all loads. There were significant improvements in power developed in all the early time intervals measured (150 ms) with the three loads (30, 50, 70% 1RM) in the UL group, while KL only improved with 30% 1RM (all the time intervals) and with 70% 1RM (at certain time intervals). Only the UL group improved throwing velocity in both standing (4.7%) and jumping (5.3%) throw (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of unknown loads has led to greater gains in power output in the early time intervals as well as to increases in throwing velocity compared with known loads. Therefore unknown loads are of significant practical use to increase both strength and in-field performance in a short period of training.",

      "abstract": "This study was designed to compare the effects of small-sided games (SSGs) and repeated shuffle sprint (RSS) training on repeated sprint ability (RSA) and countermovement jump (CMJ) tests performances of elite handball players. Eighteen highly trained players (24.8 ± 4.4 years) were assigned to either SSG or RSS group training protocols twice a week for 8 weeks. The SSG training consisted of 5 small-sided handball games with 3-a-side teams excluding goalkeepers. The RSS consisted of 2 sets of 14-17 of 20-m shuttle sprints and 9-m jump shots interspersed by 20-second recoveries. Before and after training, the following performance variables were assessed: speed on 10-m and 20-m sprint time, agility and RSA time, CMJ height, standing throw, and jump shot speed. Significant pre-to-post treatment improvements were found in all the assessed variables following both training protocols (multivariate analysis of variance, p ≤ 0.05). There was a significantly greater improvement on 10-m sprint, CMJ, and jump shooting, after the RSS in comparison with SSG training (+4.4% vs. +2.4%, +8.6% vs. +5.6%, and +5.5% vs. +2.7%, respectively). Conversely, agility and standing throwing showed lower improvements after RSS in comparison with SSG (+1.0% vs. +7.8% and +1.6% vs. +9.0%, respectively). These results indicate that these training methods are effective for fitness development among elite adult handball players during the last period of the competitive season. Specifically, SSG seems to be more effective in improving agility and standing throw, whereas RSS seems preferable in improving 10-m sprint, CMJ, and jump shot.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have shown changes in the technical and physical demands in modern handball. The game has increased considerably in speed, power and dynamics. Jump training has, therefore, become ever more important in the training of the athletes. These developments contribute to the fact that handball is now one of the most injury-prone types of sport, with the lower extremities being most frequently affected. Reactive jump training is not only used in training by now, but also increasingly in injury prevention. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of reactive jump training with handball players. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 21 regional league handball players were randomly divided into an intervention group (n = 12) and a control group (n = 9). The intervention group completed a six-week reactive jump training programme while the control group went through a non-specific training programme. Jump height (squat and counter movement jump), isokinetic and isometric maximum power as well as muscle activity served as measuring parameters. RESULTS: A comparison of the intervention and control groups revealed that the reactive jump training led to significant improvements in jump height. The isometric and isokinetic maximum power measurements and the electromyographic activities of the triceps surae muscle demonstrated an improvement in the values within the intervention group. However, this improvement was not significant compared with the control group. Likewise both jumps correlated with the muscle activity of the soleus muscle as shown by electromyography. A moderate correlation was noticed between the isokinetic maximum power measurement and the electromyographic activity of the soleus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles. Furthermore, the correlations of the isometric and isokinetic maximum power meas-urements resulted in a strong correlation coefficient. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a significant increase in jump height after reactive jump training. There was no significant difference in power development between the two groups. However, we were able to demonstrate correlations which would make it seem reasonable and interesting to investigate the question more closely. An interesting field of research could be the question of the effectiveness of reactive jump training in the areas of rehabilitation and injury prevention.",

Upon examination, increased lumbar lordosis, horizontal sacrum and anterior pelvic tilting were mainly associated with altered resting length and extensibility of the iliopsoas, hip adductors and erector spinae muscles. The intervention was directed at improving the muscles resting length and extensibility balance within a global postural alignment perspective (global postural reeducation). After the treatment period, lumbar lordosis, sacral slope and anterior pelvic tilting decreased 17.2°, 16.5° and 15.1° respectively. Global postural reeducation was effective in changing spinopelvic alignment related to low grade isthmic spondylolisthesis. This treatment option should be considered as a potential nonsurgical alternative for this condition.",
