      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study explores the formulation and effectiveness of a Rhodiola rosea phytosomal gel for enhancing wound healing. OBJECT: The ethanolic extract of Rhodiola rosea roots, rich in bioactive compounds like alkaloids and flavonoids, was optimized into a phytosomal complex to improve absorption and dermal retention. METHOD: Characterization through GC-MS revealed compounds, such as 2-Heptadecenal and Bicyclo[ 4.1.0]Heptane and 7-Pentyl. FTIR confirmed the successful encapsulation within the phospholipid bilayer, while SEM showed smooth, spherical particles. RESULT: The Box-Behnken design optimized formulation parameters, achieving high yield (92.64%), small particle size (355 nm), and high entrapment efficiency (93.98%). In vitro release studies displayed a consistent release profile, aligning with Zero-order and Hixson-Crowell models. In vivo evaluation on Wistar rats showed that the phytosomal gel significantly enhanced wound healing, achieving 98.16% wound reduction by day 14, compared to 95.17% for R. rosea extract and 97.13% for standard treatment. Histopathological analysis demonstrated complete tissue regeneration and well-organized collagen fibers in the phytosomal gel group. CONCLUSION: This research highlights the potential of Rhodiola rosea phytosomal gel as an effective wound healing therapy, with future studies suggested for extended stability tests and human skin permeation studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) affects a substantial portion of the global population, with left ventricular remodeling (LVR) and inflammation identified as key contributors to disease progression. Standardized Rhodiola rosea Injection (SRRI) is a pharmacopoeia-based botanical drug preparation derived from Rhodiola rosea, widely used in China for heart failure treatment. It is standardized in composition and quality control, with known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties. However, comprehensive evaluations of SRRI's effects on LVR and inflammatory mediators in HFrEF patients are limited. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of SRRI on LVR and inflammatory mediators in patients with HFrEF. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines. Eight databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on SRRI in HFrEF treatment with studies identified from inception to 31 October 2024. Quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool and the modified Jadad scale. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 17.0, with sensitivity analyses conducted by sequentially excluding studies to assess the robustness of findings. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test. RESULTS: Twenty-five RCTs with 2,325 participants were included. SRRI significantly improved LVR, indicated by increased LVEF (MD = 6.81, 95% CI: 5.71 to 7.91, P < 0.00001), reduced LVEDD (MD = -4.37, 95% CI: -5.42 to -3.33, P < 0.00001), and decreased LVESD (MD = -4.48, 95% CI: -5.42 to -3.58, P < 0.00001). Additionally, SRRI effectively reduced inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α (MD = -10.37, 95% CI: -12.96 to -7.78, P < 0.00001), IL-6 (MD = -6.99, 95% CI: -8.88 to -5.11, P < 0.00001), and hs-CRP (MD = -2.58, 95% CI: -3.37 to -1.79, P < 0.00001). SRRI also significantly reduced BNP (MD = -105.10, 95% CI: -132.29 to -77.90, P < 0.00001) and NT-pro BNP (MD = -415.95, 95% CI: -553.00 to -278.89, P < 0.00001). Clinical effectiveness was improved, with no significant increase in adverse reactions (RR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.25, P = 0.44). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, and no significant publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: SRRI appears to effectively enhance LVR, reduce inflammatory mediators, and improve clinical effectiveness in HFrEF patients while maintaining a favorable safety profile. However, the current evidence is limited by methodological shortcomings, and further well-designed, multicenter RCTs are needed to validate these findings, especially in diverse populations and over long-term treatment durations.

      "abstract": "Melanoma is the main cause of death from skin cancer. The current treatment methods have prominent toxic side effects. In order to more effectively inhibit melanoma and reduce the toxic side effects during treatment, this paper constructs an engineering system using DSPE-PEG2000-pYEEIE(pYEEIE) molecules to modify exosome-like nanovesicles vesicles of Rhodiola rosea (RELNs) and load Doxorubicin (DOX). As a drug system, the aim is to achieve better targeting activity of the system towards melanoma cell A375. The results showed that the morphology and particle size of the prepared RELNs met the defined criteria for evaluating extracellular vesicles. The pYEEIE-RELNs-DOX drug delivery system has a better inhibitory effect on cell proliferation compared to DOX and RELNs-DOX. At the same time, the pYEEIE-RELN-DOX drug delivery system also showed better targeting towards tumor cells. In summary, this study proposes for the first time RELNs as a new generation of drug delivery carriers and uses them for drug delivery and inhibition of melanoma cell toxicity. This lays the foundation for subsequent animal and clinical experiments, and provides new ideas for the treatment of skin cancer caused by melanoma.",

      "abstract": "Tilmicosin (TIL) is a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity derived from tylosin. TIL is effective in the treatment of bovine and ovine respiratory diseases caused by different microbes. In parallel, Rhodiola rosea (RHO) is a popular herbal remedy because of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities. The experiment lasted for 12 days. Depending on the experimental group, the animals received either distilled water or RHO root extract dissolved in distilled water for 12 days through a stomach tube, and the single subcutaneous injection on day 6 of the experiment of either 500 μL of 0.9% NaCl or TIL dissolved in 500 μL 0.9% NaCl. Samples and blood were collected for serum analysis, gene expression, and immunohistochemistry screening at liver and kidney levels. TIL injection increased serum levels of hepatic and renal markers (ALP, ALT, AST, TC, TG, creatinine, and urea) with decreased total proteins. In parallel, TIL induced hepatic and renal oxidative stress as there was an increase in malondialdehyde levels, with a decrease in catalase and reduced glutathione activities. Of interest, pre-administration of RHO inhibited TIL-induced increase in hepato-renal markers, decreased oxidative stress, and increased liver and kidney antioxidant activities. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that TIL increased the liver's HSP70 (heat shock protein), NFkB, and TNF-α mRNA expression. Moreover, TIL upregulated the expression of desmin, nestin, and vimentin expression in the kidney. The upregulated genes were decreased significantly in the protective group that received RHO. Serum inflammatory cytokines and genes of inflammatory markers were affected in liver tissues (HSP70, NFkB, and TNF-α) and kidney tissues (desmin, nestin, and vimentin)-TIL-induced hepatic vacuolation and congestion together with glomerular atrophy. The immunoreactivity of PCNA and HMGB1 was examined immunohistochemically. At cellular levels, PCNA was decreased while HMGB1 immunoreactivity was increased in TIL-injected rats, which was improved by pre-administration of RHO. RHO administration protected the altered changes in liver and renal histology. Current findings support the possible use of RHO to shield the liver and kidney from the negative effects of tilmicosin.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment, depression and (mental) fatigue represent the most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms of the post-COVID syndrome. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified as common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms. Attempts to treat post-COVID-associated cognitive impairment and fatigue with different drugs available for other diseases have not yet been successful. One probable explanation could be that these drugs work by one specific mechanism of action only and not in a broad multi-target way. Therefore, they will not address the broad pathophysiological spectrum possibly responsible for cognitive impairment, depression and fatigue in post-COVID syndrome. Notably, nearly all drugs currently under investigation for fatigue in post-COVID syndrome are rather addressing one single target instead of the several pathomechanisms underlying this condition. Contrary to this approach, herbal drugs often consist of many different ingredients with different pharmacological properties and pharmacological targets. Therefore, these drugs might be a promising approach for the treatment of the broad symptomatic presentation and the pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment and fatigue following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these herbal drugs, extracts of Ginkgo biloba and Rhodiola rosea probably are the best investigated candidates. Their broad pharmacological spectrum in vitro and in vivo includes anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant as well as properties reducing cognitive impairment and fatigue. In several studies, both drugs showed positive effects on physical and mental fatigue and impaired cognition. Moreover, depressive symptoms were also reduced in some studies. However, even if these results are promising, the data are still preliminary and require additional proof by further studies.",

      "abstract": "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Rhodiola rosea (golden root) and Punica granatum (pomegranate), as well as a number of other species of medicinal plants, exert an array of biological effects: adaptogenic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. However, there are not enough contemporary studies of their influence on metabolic processes, especially in cases of imbalanced diet. Lipid dysregulation is the main reason for many diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disorders, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. Recently, a growing amount of evidence has suggested the positive effects of certain natural nutrients on lipid metabolism. The work aims to define the general effect of golden root rhizome and pomegranate peel on physiological activity and metabolic processes in model animals fed with excessively fat diet. This study is relevant for the development of drugs and food additives for treatment and prophylaxis of metabolism disorders. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In a 30-day experiment, we determined the effect of golden root (Rhodiola rosea L.) rhizome and pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) peel on the physiological activity and metabolic processes of 24 laboratory rats consuming a high-fat diet. The physical activity was evaluated according to the mass gain of animals and change in the relative mass of the internal organs, and also the functional conditions of the central nervous system, as demonstrated by the indicators of the locomotor activity and emotional status, determined in the open field test. The influence on the metabolic processes was revealed by biochemical and clinical blood analyses. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Body mass of rats fed with golden root (R. rosea) reached 125.8 % of the initial body mass; when fed on pomegranate (P. granatum), it reached 123.9 %; and the control group reached only 111.5 % of the initial body mass. The rhizomes of R. rosea in the diet of male rats during the month of the experiment did not cause significant changes in the relative organ mass, and the pomegranate peel fruits led to a decrease in the thymus relative mass, as well as liver and brain. R. rosea rhizomes in the rats' diet led to an increase in the activity of alkaline phosphatase, and also to a decrease in the concentration of urea and urea nitrogen. Diet supplemented with R. rosea also contributed to a strong decrease in plasma concentrations of bilirubin and triglycerides (up to 57.0 % compared with the concentration in the control group). The rhizomes of R. rosea contributed to an unreliable decrease in the atherogenicity index. The pomegranate peel also greatly increased alkaline phosphatase activity and reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations. In addition, in rats consuming the peel of P. granatum, blood glucose concentration decreased. Under the influence of P. granatum, a strong increase in the atherogenic index of plasma (up to 518.6 % of the control) was observed because of a decrease in the concentration of high-density lipoproteins (up to 57.1 %) and a simultaneous elevation of the concentration of low-density lipoproteins (up to 158.3 % of the control). Open field test between groups remained without significant changes. NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: The results indicate that the rhizome of R. rosea and peel of P. granatum are safe as food additives to high-fat diet and did not cause pathological changes and side effects, and at the same time significantly influence the metabolic processes (lipid and carbohydrate). Our study theoretically substantiates the use of R. rosea rhizome and P. granatum peel for the production of nutraceutical and pharmacological products for the correction of metabolic disorders of people and animals. Doses and periods of their application require further research."

The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was used to measure the functional score, and the change in hind paw volume (HPV). Both parameters had significant antiarthritic effects. Based on these preliminary results, an adjuvant arthritis (AA) model was further applied to assess another parameters. The experiment included these animal groups: healthy controls, untreated AA, AA administered with RSE (150 mg/kg b.w. daily, p.o.), AA administered by MTX (0.3 mg/kg b.w. twice a week, p.o.), and AA treated with the combination of RSE+MTX. The combination of RSE+MTX significantly reduced the HPV and increased the body weight. The combination significantly decreased HPV when compared to MTX monotherapy. The plasmatic levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-17A, MMP-9 and CRP) were significantly decreased by MTX+RSE treatment. The RSE monotherapy didn't influence any of the inflammatory parameters studied. In CIA, the RSE monotherapy significantly decreased the arthritic parameters studied. In summary, the combination of RSE and sub-therapeutic MTX was significantly effective in AA by improving inflammatory and arthritic parameters.",

      "abstract": "Hydrophobic drug delivery vectors suffer significant challenges in cancer therapy, including efficient encapsulation and tumor targeting ability. In the present study, Rhodiola rosea polysaccharides (RHPs), which have the ability to modulate Tumor-associated macrophages and typical structural characteristics, were employed as an immunoactive vector for drug delivery. Folic acid (FA) and stearic acid (SA) were chemically modified to the backbone of RHPs to obtain the self-assembly and tumor-targeting behavior. Further, the hydrophobic drug, doxorubicin (DOX), was encapsulated in the RHPs derivatives (FA-RHPs-SA) with high efficiency. Additionally, the optimally formed DOX@FA-RHPs-SA had a uniform size distribution of approximately 196 nm and a pH-sensitive release capacity in different acidic conditions. In vitro experiments demonstrated that tumor cells could efficiently uptake DOX@FA-RHPs-SA. Furthermore, the modulatory function of the FA-RHPs-SA on RAW264.7 macrophages was also demonstrated in the transition from M0 to M1 phenotypes, and the M2 differentiated into the M1. Finally, the in vivo antitumor study revealed that the inhibitory effect of DOX@FA-RHPs-SA was superior to the DOX monotherapy treatment, and the new preparation functioned synergistically by inducing tumor cell apoptosis and modulating immune cell function. In conclusion, this study described an RHPs-based hydrophobic delivery vector and achieved an additional helpful antitumor effect by modulating Tumor-associated macrophages.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To study the effect of Rhodiola Rosea injection on cardiac function and the reninangiotensin- aldosterone system (RASS) in rats with chronic heart failure. BACKGROUND: Rhodiola Rosea injection, a traditional Chinese medication for relieving blood stasis and improving blood circulation, is an excellent therapeutic for treating coronary heart disease-angina pectoris. Rhodiola Rosea injection's major component, salidroside, protects the cardiovascular system. But there isn't much first-hand evidence about how injectable Rhodiola Rosea affects heart failure. OBJECTIVES: In this study, a rat model of heart failure was established, and the effect of Rhodiola rosea injection on myocardial cell morphology, cardiac function, and ventricular remodelling in rats with heart failure was investigated. METHODS: 66 SD male rats were selected; 10 were randomly selected as a blank control group, and 56 were treated intraperitoneally with doxorubicin (4 g/g). After 6 weeks, all animals had LVEF 60%. Established a heart failure model. Each group had 14 rats: model control, low-dose, mediumdose, and high-dose Rhodiola Rosea injection. The 2 mL/kg of Rhodiola Rosea injection was injected into the tail vein once a day for 2 weeks. Both the blank and control groups received normal daily saline. After 2 weeks, the echocardiographic index, RASS-related index, and serum BNP level were assessed in all rats, and myocardial tissue morphology was observed. MiRNA423-5p, miRNA499-5p, and miRNA210-3p were extracted from peripheral blood. Rhodiola rosea injection on its expression was compared to healthy control rats. RESULTS: 6 mL/kg Rhodiola Rosea injection lowered LVEDV and LVESV while increasing LVEF and LVFS. Injections of 6 mL/kg Rhodiola Rosea reduce plasma levels of miR-210-3p, miR-423- 5p, miRNA-499, and BNP in heart failure model rats. The 6 mL/kg Rhodiola Rosea injection can restore the RASS indexes of heart failure rats to the level of the normal group. CONCLUSION: The present study offers preliminary evidence supporting the use of Rhodiola Rosea injection in the treatment of heart failure and offers a solid foundation for clinical off-label medication use.",

      "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common respiratory disease in clinics, which is characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane loss, plasma protein leakage, pulmonary edema, massive neutrophil infiltration, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Rhodiola rosea L. an adaptogenic plant rich in phenylethanoloids, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We hope to verify the relieving effect of total glycosides of Rhodiola rosea L. (RTG) on ALI in mice and clarify its mechanism through this study. In this study, we identified the effect and mechanism of RTG on ALI through LPS-induced ALI mice. After RTG treatment, the pathological structure of lung tissue in ALI mice induced by LPS was significantly improved, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced. In addition, RTG reduced the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the serum of ALI mice and reduced the content or activity of MPO, T-SOD, GSH, and MDA in lung tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that RTG ameliorated LPS-induced ALI through anti-inflammatory, reduced immune response, and anti-apoptotic activities. The western blotting analysis confirmed that RTG could down-regulate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα/IκBα. These results suggest that RTG can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through antioxidants and inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.",

Recent studies have illustrated that this disease may predispose individuals to certain microbiome compositions, and treatments like metformin have been shown to change gut microbiota and their associated metabolic pathways. However, given the limitations and side effects associated with pharmaceuticals currently being used for therapy of diabetes, there is a significant need for alternative treatments. In this study, we investigated the effects of a root extract from Rhodiola rosea in a Leptin receptor knockout (db/db) mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Our previous work showed that Rhodiola rosea had anti-inflammatory and gut microbiome-modulating properties, while extending lifespan in several animal models. In this study, treatment with Rhodiola rosea improved fasting blood glucose levels, altered the response to exogenous insulin, and decreased circulating lipopolysaccharide and hepatic C-reactive protein transcript levels. We hypothesize that these changes may in part reflect the modulation of the microbiota, resulting in improved gut barrier integrity and decreasing the translocation of inflammatory biomolecules into the bloodstream. These findings indicate that Rhodiola rosea is an attractive candidate for further research in the management of type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sustained stress with the overproduction of corticosteroids has been shown to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to an oxidative stress state. Mitochondria are the main generators of ROS and are directly and detrimentally affected by their overproduction. Neurons depend almost solely on ATP produced by mitochondria in order to satisfy their energy needs and to form synapses, while stress has been proven to alter synaptic plasticity. Emerging evidence underpins that Rhodiola rosea, an adaptogenic plant rich in polyphenols, exerts antioxidant, antistress, and neuroprotective effects. METHODS: In this study, the effect of Rhodiola rosea extract (RRE) WS®1375 on neuronal ROS regulation, bioenergetics, and neurite outgrowth, as well as its potential modulatory effect on the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway, was evaluated in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and the murine hippocampal HT22 cell lines. Stress was induced using the corticosteroid dexamethasone. RESULTS: RRE increased bioenergetics as well as cell viability and scavenged ROS with a similar efficacy in both cells lines and counteracted the respective corticosteroid-induced dysregulation. The effect of RRE, both under dexamethasone-stress and under normal conditions, resulted in biphasic U-shape and inverted U-shape dose response curves, a characteristic feature of adaptogenic plant extracts. Additionally, RRE treatment promoted neurite outgrowth and induced an increase in BDNF levels. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that RRE may constitute a candidate for the prevention of stress-induced pathophysiological processes as well as oxidative stress. Therefore, it could be employed against stress-associated mental disorders potentially leading to the development of a condition-specific supplementation.",

      "abstract": "Rhodiola rosea L. (Crassulaceae) are popularly used as a natural supplement for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Here, saponin extracts from R. rosea were investigated for their roles on relieving sleeplessness. The levels of neurotransmitters, hormones, and inflammation cytokines in plasma, and the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the hypothalamus and hippocampus were detected using ELISA, RT-PCR, and western blotting. First, the butanol fraction extracted from R. rosea was collected as the total saponins (HJT-I), then a saponin-rich fraction (HJT-II) was obtained after the further purification of HJT-I. The saponin contents of HJT-I and HJT-II were 28.92% and 65.69%, respectively. Second, behavioral tests were performed and showed that both HJT-I and HJT-II could effectively reduce the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test, and shorten sleep latency and prolong the sleep duration time in the sodium barbital-induced sleeping test, with HJT-II better than HJT-I. Third, ELLISA results showed that the concentrations of GABA, 5-HT, norepinephrine (NA), PGD2, and IL-1β in plasma were significantly increased after HJT-I and HJT-II administration, while IL-6 was decreased. HJT-I and HJT-II also exhibited differential modulation of the receptors of 5-HT, GABA, PGD2, and IL-1β expression. In hypothalamus, HJT-II was more powerful than HJT-I in regulation of the GABAARα2, GABAARα3, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67 expression, as well as 5-HT2A and IL-1β. As for DPR and PGD2, HJT-II was more effective in the hippocampus. The efficacy of HJT-I was better than HJT-II at stimulating GABAARα2, GAD 65/67, 5-HT1A, and IL-1β expression in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the potential sedative and hypnotic effects of HJT-I and HJT-II may possibly be related to the serotonergic, GABAAergic, and immune systems, while the underlying mechanism of HJT-I and HJT-II differed from each other.",

Resistance-trained males (n = 10) participated in this study. In a double-blinded, crossover, counterbalanced study design, participants supplemented with either 1500 mg/day of GRE or placebo (PL; gluten-free cornstarch) for 3 days prior to experimentation. An additional 500 mg dose was ingested 30 min prior to exercise testing. During each exercise trial, participants completed 2 repetitions of bench press at 75% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) as explosively as possible. A linear position transducer was used to measure mean concentric velocity. After 5 min of rest, participants completed 3 sets × repetitions to failure (RTF) at 75% 1RM separated by 2 min of rest between each set. A capillary blood sample was obtained pre- (PRE) and immediately post- (POST) exercise to measure blood concentrations lactate (LA), epinephrine (EPI), and norepinephrine (NE). Mean concentric velocity was significantly higher with GRE when compared to PL (p = 0.046). However, total RTF were significantly lower with GRE versus PL (p < 0.001). Regardless of treatment, LA was significantly higher Post versus Pre (p < 0.001), but GRE resulted in greater Post values compared to PL (p = 0.049). EPI and NE increased in both conditions Pre to Post (p < 0.001). However, Pre NE was significantly higher with GRE versus PL (p = 0.008). Findings indicate that short-term GRE supplementation increases mean bench press velocity but decreases bench press repetition volume. Furthermore, GRE resulted in higher NE levels and blood lactate following exercise. Thus, supplementing with GRE may enhance explosive resistance training performance but may also impair upper body strength-endurance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common and mortal cancer worldwide. Rhodiola rosea L. (RR), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been turned out to be effective in anti-lung cancer therapy, but its molecular mechanism of action has not been clearly understood. PURPOSE: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the effect of RR against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by systems pharmacology. METHODS: The effects of RR on NSCLC were examined in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor-bearing mice models. The possible molecular mechanism was unraveled by systems pharmacology, which includes pharmacokinetics evaluation, active compounds screening, target prediction and network analysis. Cell proliferation was examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay; cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry; protein and proinflammatory cytokines expression were evaluated by Western blot and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: In vivo, RR significantly inhibited the tumor growth and prolonged the survival of the tumor bearing mice. In silico, we identified 19 potential active molecules (e.g., salidroside and rhodiosin), 112 targets (e.g., COX-2 and AKT) and 27 pathways (e.g., PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway) for RR. Additionally, targets analysis and networks construction further revealed that RR exerted anti-cancer effects by regulating apoptosis, angiogenesis and inflammation. In vitro, salidroside could significantly decrease expression of pro-angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF and eNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., COX-2, iNOS and TNF-α). Also, Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein was decreased whereas Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, was increased. Further flow cytometry analysis showed that salidroside could induce apoptosis in H1975 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanistically, the antitumor effect of RR on NSCLC was responsible for the synergy among anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic.",

      "abstract": "Golden root (Rhodiola rosea L., Crassulaceae) is a famous medical plant with a one-sided history of scientific interest in the roots and rhizomes as sources of bioactive compounds, unlike the herb, which has not been studied extensively. To address this deficiency, we used high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array and electrospray triple quadrupole mass detection for comparative qualitative and quantitative analysis of the metabolic profiles of Rhodiola rosea organs before and after gastrointestinal digestion in simulated conditions together with various biochemical assays to determine antioxidant properties of the extracts and selected compounds. R. rosea organs showed 146 compounds, including galloyl O-glucosides, catechins, procyanidins, simple phenolics, phenethyl alcohol derivatives, (hydroxy)cinnamates, hydroxynitrile glucosides, monoterpene O-glucosides, and flavonol O-glycosides, most of them for the first time in the species. The organ-specific distribution of compounds found for catechins, procyanidins, and cinnamyl alcohols and glucosides was typical for underground organs and flavonoids and galloylated glucoses concentrated in the herb. Extracts from rhizomes, leaves and flowers showed high phenolic content and were effective scavengers of free radicals (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS•+), O2•-, •OH) and protected β-carotene in a bleaching assay. Digestion in the gastric and intestine phase influenced the composition of R. rosea extracts negatively, affecting the content of catechins, procyanidins, and galloyl glucoses, and therefore, the antioxidativity level. After gut microbiota treatment, the antioxidant capacity of rhizome extract was lower than leaves and flowers due to the aglycone composition found in the colonic phase of digestion. Our study demonstrated that the herb of R. rosea is a rich source of metabolites with high antioxidant properties and could be a valuable plant for new bioactive products."

METHODS: The effect of RE on the biofilm formation and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) synthesis of S. mutans was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), crystal violet staining and CFU counting method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied to observe the surface morphology of S. mutans biofilms formed on glass coverslips and dental enamel. To study the relevant mechanism, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and zymogram assay were applied to measure the expression of virulence genes and the enzymatic activity of glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) under the treatment of RE. The CCK-8 assay was also performed on macrophages (RAWs) and human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) in order to evaluate its biocompatibility. RESULTS: As a result, RE inhibited the biofilm formation and EPS synthesis of S. mutans. RE also suppressed the expression of gtf genes and quorum sensing (QS) system as well as the enzymatic activity of Gtf proteins. Moreover, RE exhibited a good biocompatibility to human cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the evidence for RE as a novel anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.",

Methods Lewis lung cancer-bearing mice were randomly divided into normal saline group, 500 mg/kg RRL ethanol extract treatment group, and 10 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CTX) treatment group. All the groups underwent the treatment for 10 days. The mouse survival rate and tumor inhibitory rate were calculated. Additionally, the numbers of CD4+T and CD8+ T cells of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as well as the proportion of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the CD4+CD25+Tregs were detected by flow cytometry. Besides, the serum levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and γ-interferon (IFN-γ) in the tumor-bearing mice were examined through ELISA, and the spleen cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity was detected by the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Results Lewis tumor-bearing mice treated with the ethanol extract of RRL showed remarkably enhanced survival rate and inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, the number of tumor infiltrating CD4+T and CD8+ T cells increased, while the proportion of FOXP3+ Tregs in the CD4+CD25+Tregs showed a declined tendency. Meanwhile, the serum IFN-γ and IL-2 levels in Lewis tumor-bearing mice increased, and the killing capacity of spleen CTL was enhanced.

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The plant arctic root (Rhodiola rosea, L.) is growing in northern regions of Europe, Asia and North America. Extracts of R. rosea are used in traditional medicine for various conditions related to nervous system function. According to scientific studies from the last decades, the plant might have potential for use in the treatment of memory impairments, stress and depression, but reports concerning other neuropsychiatric disorders are scarce. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this context, our study aimed to examine potential antipsychotic-like effects of R. rosea root extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the effects of R. rosea root extract on prepulse inhibition in rats and mice. Prepulse inhibition is an established operational measure of sensorimotor gating, which is impaired in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. RESULTS: R. rosea root extract increased prepulse inhibition in rats and mice. Interestingly, the R. rosea extract had stronger effects in those individual animals that had low baseline levels of prepulse inhibition. Therefore, we performed further experiments in which we pharmacologically induced a prepulse inhibition deficit by two different psychostimulants, either the dopamine D2 receptor agonist apomorphine or the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801). Pre-treatment with the R. rosea extract significantly restored both, apomorphine- and dizocilpine-induced prepulse inhibition deficits. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that R. rosea extract robustly reverses prepulse inhibition deficits in rodents. This suggests antipsychotic-like effects of R. rosea extract. Future studies should focus on the pharmacological mechanisms underlying these effects.",

We investigated the effect of a single dose intake of Rhodiola rosea extract on the plastic after-effects induced by anodal and cathodal motor cortex transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in humans. METHODS: Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were required to intake 500 mg of either RRE or placebo. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation was used to investigate cortical excitability. Motor threshold, recruitment of motor-evoked potentials, cortical silent period, short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation were assessed at different time points. Spinal excitability and peripheral nerve conduction were measured by F-response and M-wave. Furthermore, we assessed the modulation of cortical plasticity using transcranial direct current stimulation after-effects on Motor Evoked Potentials amplitudes. RESULTS: Rhodiola rosea extract acute intake prevented cathodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation-induced Long-term depression-like plasticity. The extract intake did not affect cortical excitability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a single oral dose of Rhodiola rosea extract intake modulates cortical plasticity in humans preventing the activity-dependent reduction in the efficacy of neuronal synapses. These results suggest that the adaptogenic and antidepressant effects of Rhodiola rosea extract might be based on its modulation of brain plasticity.",

      "abstract": "Rhodiola rosea L. radix (RRL) is one of the most popular medical herb which has been widely used for the treatment of different diseases effectively, including cardiovascular diseases and nerve system diseases. However, due to the multiple compounds in RRL, the underlying molecular mechanisms of RRL are remained unclear. To decipher the action mechanisms of RRL from a systematic perspective, a systems pharmacology approach integrated absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) system, drug targeting, and network analysis was introduced. First, by the ADME screening system and the target fishing process, 56 potential active compounds and 62 targets were obtained, respectively. In addition, compound-target network demonstrated that most compounds interacted with multiple targets, indicating that RRL may enhance its therapeutic effects probably through hitting on multiple targets in a holistic level. Moreover, target-pathway network and gene ontology analysis showed that multiple targets of RRL were involved in several biological pathways, i.e. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and VEGF signaling pathway, which dissecting the therapeutic effects of RRL on various diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, depression, adaptation diseases, etc. In summary, this work successfully explains the potential active compounds and the multi-scale curative action mechanisms of RRL for treating various diseases; meanwhile, it implies that RRL could be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in arthritic diseases. Most importantly, this work provides an in silico strategy to understand the action mechanisms of herbal medicines from molecular/system levels, which will promote the new drug development of traditional Chinese medicine.",

      "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominant, late-onset disease characterized by choreiform movements, cognitive decline, and personality disturbance. It is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the Huntington's disease gene encoding for the Huntingtin protein (Htt) which functions as a scaffold for selective macroautophagy. Mutant Htt (mHtt) disrupts vesicle trafficking and prevents autophagosome fusion with lysosomes, thus deregulating autophagy in neuronal cells, leading to cell death. Autophagy has been described as a therapeutic target for HD, owing to the key role Htt plays in the cellular process. Rhodiola rosea, a plant extract used in traditional medicine in Europe and Asia, has been shown to attenuate aging in the fly and other model species. It has also been shown to inhibit the mTOR pathway and induce autophagy in bladder cancer cell lines. We hypothesized that R. rosea, by inducing autophagy, may improve the phenotype of a Huntington's disease model of the fly. Flies expressing HttQ93 which exhibit decreased lifespan, impaired locomotion, and increased neurodegeneration were supplemented with R. rosea extract, and assays testing lifespan, locomotion, and pseudopupil degeneration provided quantitative measures of improvement. Based on our observations, R. rosea may be further evaluated as a potential therapy for Huntington's disease.",

Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) represent a huge reservoir of bioactive chemicals and many TCMs have been shown to have antiviral activities. 373 extracts from 128 TCMs were evaluated using a high throughput assay to screen for inhibitors of Ebola virus cell entry. Extract of Rhodiola rosea displayed specific and potent inhibition against cell entry of both Ebola virus and Marburg virus. In addition, twenty commercial compounds that were isolated from Rhodiola rosea were evaluated using the pseudotyped Ebola virus entry assay, and it was found that ellagic acid and gallic acid, which are two structurally related compounds, are the most effective ones. The activity of the extract and the two pure compounds were validated using infectious Ebola virus. The time-of-addition experiments suggest that, mechanistically, the Rhodiola rosea extract and the effective compounds act at an early step in the infection cycle following initial cell attachment, but prior to viral/cell membrane fusion. Our findings provide evidence that Rhodiola rosea has potent anti-filovirus properties that may be developed as a novel anti-Ebola treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The root extract of Rhodiola rosea has historically been used in Europe and Asia as an adaptogen, and similar to ginseng and Shisandra, shown to display numerous health benefits in humans, such as decreasing fatigue and anxiety while improving mood, memory, and stamina. A similar extract in the Rhodiola family, Rhodiola crenulata, has previously been shown to confer positive effects on the gut homeostasis of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Although, R. rosea has been shown to extend lifespan of many organisms such as fruit flies, worms and yeast, its anti-aging mechanism remains uncertain. Using D. melanogaster as our model system, the purpose of this work was to examine whether the anti-aging properties of R. rosea are due to its impact on the microbial composition of the fly gut. RESULTS: Rhodiola rosea treatment significantly increased the abundance of Acetobacter, while subsequently decreasing the abundance of Lactobacillales of the fly gut at 10 and 40 days of age. Additionally, supplementation of the extract decreased the total culturable bacterial load of the fly gut, while increasing the overall quantifiable bacterial load. The extract did not display any antimicrobial activity when disk diffusion tests were performed on bacteria belonging to Microbacterium, Bacillus, and Lactococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Under standard and conventional rearing conditions, supplementation of R. rosea significantly alters the microbial community of the fly gut, but without any general antibacterial activity. Further studies should investigate whether R. rosea impacts the gut immunity across multiple animal models and ages."

AIM: The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of extracts from Rhodiola and Curcuma on immunoreactivity of animals subjected to a chronic mild stress (CMS) model followed by lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n=56) divided in 7 groups were treated orally with: distilled water 10 ml/kg (control and CMS model groups); Rhodiola 250 mg/kg; Rhodiola 500 mg/kg; Curcuma 250 mg/kg; Curcuma 500 mg/kg, Rhodiola 250 mg/kg and Curcuma 250 mg/kg. All groups except the control were stressed daily according to a CMS protocol. Changes in glucose preference, weight gain and locomotor activity were recorded. In the sixth week the animals were challenged with LPS and rats' sera were obtained for ELISA evaluation of TNF-α and IL-6 levels. RESULTS: The animals from the model group decreased their weight gain, glucose preference and locomotor activity compared to controls. The groups exposed to stress and treated with Rhodiola 500 mg/kg, Curcuma 500 mg/kg and their combination increased their locomotor activity compared to the model group. High expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were found in all groups exposed to CMS and challenged by LPS. CONCLUSIONS: The groups exposed to the stress procedure showed a variety of depression-like behavioral changes. In addition, ELISA tests showed that CMS is affecting rats' immunity by increasing the cytokines' levels. These changes could be reversed by administration of Rhodiola and Curcuma in combination suggesting synergic interaction regarding their anti-inflammatory and anti-stress effects.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Stress describes the physiological reaction to threat or pressure, which manifests as physical symptoms of exhaustion or energy loss and psychological symptoms, including irritability or tension. If untreated, chronic stress or burnout may develop, both are areas of unmet medical need. Evidence-based treatment and prevention measures are needed. Methods: Prevention strategies and existing treatment options for stress-related symptoms were evaluated to establish criteria for an adequate pharmacological approach to stress. The authors reviewed the literature to reach a clinically meaningful strategy for prevention and treatment of persistent stress symptoms and their consequences, including burnout and secondary diseases. Results: Current medication reveals a treatment gap. Most drugs target only psychological or physical stress symptoms. Furthermore, psychotropic medications sometimes prescribed for stress often have unacceptable side effects and bear a risk of overtreatment. Ideally pharmacological therapy should afford comprehensive treatment of all stress symptoms with a favourable safety profile. Conclusions: Rhodiola rosea extract (RRE) fulfils important requirements. It is the main adaptogen approved by the HMPC/EMA for the indication 'stress' and influences the release of stress hormones while boosting energy metabolism as revealed in animal literature. RRE offers comprehensive treatment of stress symptoms and can prevent chronic stress and stress-related complications.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study is the first clinical trial aiming to explore the clinical outcomes in burnout patients treated with Rhodiola rosea. The reported capacity of R. rosea to strengthen the organism against stress and its good tolerability offer a promising approach in the treatment of stress-related burnout. The aim of the treatment was to increase stress resistance, thus addressing the source rather than the symptoms of the syndrome and preventing subsequent diseases associated with a history of burnout. The objective of the trial was to provide the exploratory data required for planning future randomized trials in burnout patients in order to investigate the clinical outcomes of treatment with R. rosea dry extract in this target group. METHODS: The study was planned as an exploratory, open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial. A wide range of rating scales were assessed and evaluated in an exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses regarding clinical courses and to provide a basis for the planning of subsequent studies. A total of 118 outpatients were enrolled. A daily dose of 400 mg R. rosea extract (WS® 1375, Rosalin) was administered over 12 weeks. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the German version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Burnout Screening Scales I and II, Sheehan Disability Scale, Perceived Stress Questionnaire, Number Connection Test, Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire, Numerical Analogue Scales for different stress symptoms and impairment of sexual life, Patient Sexual Function Questionnaire, and the Clinical Global Impression Scales. RESULTS: The majority of the outcome measures showed clear improvement over time. Several parameters had already improved after 1 week of treatment and continued to improve further up to the end of the study. The incidence of adverse events was low with 0.015 events per observation day. DISCUSSION: The trial reported here was the first to investigate clinical outcomes in patients suffering from burnout symptoms when treated with R. rosea. During administration of the study drug over the course of 12 weeks, a wide range of outcome measures associated with the syndrome clearly improved. CONCLUSION: The results presented provide an encouraging basis for clinical trials further investigating the clinical outcomes of R. rosea extract in patients with the burnout syndrome."

A daily dosage of 400 mg is recommended. METHODS: A dry ethanolic extract of R. rosea (WS® 1375) was studied in 100 subjects with prolonged or chronic fatigue symptoms. In an uncontrolled, open-label multicenter clinical trial, the subjects were administered 2 × 200 mg WS® 1375 over 8 weeks. Outcome measures were scales and tests related to fatigue. They were evaluated in an exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses regarding efficacy. The pilot character of the trial is marked by its broad focus on subjects suffering from fatigue in general and by its comparatively long duration. RESULTS: The greatest change was observed after 1 week of treatment. The fatigue symptoms continued to decline further, with statistically significant improvement at week 8. The safety assessments of WS® 1375 during the trial proved to be favorable, with most adverse events being of mild intensity and not related to the study drug. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that 2 × 200 mg WS® 1375 may be an effective treatment in subjects suffering from prolonged or chronic fatigue. The safety and tolerability of WS® 1375 also presented a favorable profile.",

The most valued part of the plant is its rhizome, which has a rose-like fragrance. In the available literature, there is a large number of mentions of its healing properties; nonetheless, only few of them are based on reliable scientific evidence. Of the neuropsychotropic effects, there are mentions of anxiolytic, antidepressant, neuroprotective and pro- cognitive properties and nonspecific \"adaptogenic\" effects. These effects are well established according to the preclinical studies; nonetheless many of clinical studies have serious drawbacks in design or interpretation of results. Extracts of R. rosea are well tolerated in general and thus regarded as safe. On the other hand, some pharmacokinetic interactions at the level of cytochrome P450 enzymes cannot be omitted. The extracts of R. rosea, are considered, according to the regulation of the Ministry of Health, as food supplements. According to the long standing use of R. rosea, it may be used for traditional treatment of symptoms of fatigue or mental weakness, but it seems that there is not enough evidence for general recommendation of use of R. rosea extracts in clinical practice.Key words: Rhodiola rosea neuropsychotropic effects phytomedicine.",

However, phytotherapeutics appear to be an interesting option for PE management. The present study aimed to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a phytotherapeutic combination of Rhodiola rosea, folic acid, biotin and zinc (EndEP®) in the treatment of patients affected by lifelong PE. All patients affected by lifelong PE who were attending three Urological Institutions from July to December 2014 were enrolled in this prospective, multicentre, phase I-II study. All patients were assigned to receive oral tablets of EndEP® (one tablet per day) for 90 days. Clinical and instrumental analyses were carried out at enrolment and at the end of the study. International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-15, Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) and Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaires were used. The intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) for each event was also evaluated using the stop-watch technique. The main outcome measure was the difference from baseline in PEDT questionnaire and mean IELT at the end of the follow-up period. In total, 91 patients (mean age, 32.3±5.6 years) were analysed. The baseline questionnaires mean scores were 1.1±1.6, 26.1±2.9, 15.3±3.4 and 98.2±0.5, for IPSS, IIEF-15, PEDT and SF-36, respectively. The mean IELT at baseline was 73.6±46.9s. At the follow-up examination (90 days after the start of treatment), no statistically significant differences were identified in terms of IPSS (1.4±1.5) or IIEF-15 (26.3±3.1) compared with the pre-treatment values (P=0.19 and P=0.64, respectively). A statistically significant difference was detected between the mean IELT at enrolment and after treatment (73.6±46.9 vs. 102.3±60.0; P<0.001) and SF-36 questionnaire (98.2±0.5 vs. 99.4±0.1; P<0.001). Fifty-five patients reported improvement in the control of ejaculation (60.4%). Very few adverse events were reported (4.4%). In conclusion, it was found that EndEP® significantly improved ejaculatory control and the quality of sexual life in patients affected by lifelong PE, with a very low rate of adverse events."

To examine the effect of R. rosea on T cells under simulated microgravity, spaceflight analogs of human head‑down bed rest (HDBR) at ‑6˚ and murine hind limb unloading (HU) were used. A decrease in the levels of interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ) and interleukin‑17 (IL‑17) and an increase in regulatory T (Treg) cells were observed in the placebo group following HDBR. The R. rosea treated HBDR group demonstrated further decreased IFN‑γ production, however, R. rosea exhibited no effect on the ratio of circulating Tregs or Treg cell differentiation. By contrast, the treatment of R. rosea on human T cells in vitro did not alter IFN‑γ secretion, however, Treg differentiation was significantly reduced. An R. rosea‑induced upregulation of hypoxia‑inducible factor 1α (HIF‑1α) contributed to the suppression of Treg differentiation in vitro. Differences in the effect of R. rosea in vitro and in vivo were also observed using a mouse model of microgravity. The results of the current study suggest that R. rosea has differential modulatory effects on T cells in vivo and in vitro and care should be taken when evaluating the effects of R. rosea on the immune system.",

      "abstract": "Rhodiola rosea L. (roseroot) is a common member of the family Crassulaceae, known as one of the most important popular medicinal plants in the northern region of Europe. The roots of R. rosea possess a wide range of pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anticancer, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective effects that are because of the presence of different phytochemicals such as phenols and flavonoids. In addition, the presence of salidroside, rosavins, and p-tyrosol are responsible for its beneficial effects for the treatment of on depression, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. A plethora of studies report that R. rosea has potent neuroprotective effects through the suppression of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and excitotoxicity in brain tissues and antagonism of oncogenic p21-activated kinase. However, to our knowledge, no review articles have been published addressing the neuroprotective effects of R. rosea. Therefore, the present article aims at critically reviewing the available literature on the beneficial effects of R. rosea on as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases where oxidative stress plays a major role in disease development and progression. We also discuss the cultivation, phytochemistry, clinical impacts, and adverse effects of R. rosea to provide a broader insight on the therapeutic potential for this plant.",

      "abstract": "The root and rhizome extract of Rhodiola rosea has been extensively used in traditional medicine to improve physical and mental performance and to protect against stress. We, and others, have reported that R. rosea can extend lifespan in flies, worms, and yeast. We also previously found that the extract can act independently of dietary restriction (DR), a treatment that can extend lifespan in a range of model organisms. In flies, DR is implemented through a reduction in dietary yeast content. Here, we report that the ability of R. rosea extract to extend lifespan in flies is dependent on the carbohydrate and caloric content when supplemented with a simplified diet composed of yeast and sucrose. R. rosea extract elevated the sugar content in flies and down-regulated hexokinase expression, suggesting that it perturbs carbohydrate metabolism in flies. In our previous studies, bananas, barley malt, and corn syrup provided dietary carbohydrates, and R. rosea extract could extend lifespan with a range of caloric levels. We conclude that the lifespan-extending effect of R. rosea extract in flies is dependent on dietary carbohydrate and caloric contents coupled with an interaction with complex dietary components present in bananas, barley, or corn.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Menopausal women are challenged by the adverse effects of estrogen loss on energy, mood, cognitive function, and memory. These stresses are compounded by increased risks for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cancer. Known to have neuroprotective, cardio-protective, anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic effects, Rhodiola rosea extracts have also been shown to improve energy, mood, cognitive function and memory. PURPOSE: We propose that R. rosea be investigated for use as a potential selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) in the prevention and treatment of menopause-related fatigue, stress, depression, cognitive decline, memory impairment, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and cancer. METHOD: This paper briefly reviews the relationship between estrogen decline and menopause-related health risks, the molecular mechanisms underlying estrogenic effects on health, and the evidence indicating beneficial effects of R. rosea extracts on these mechanisms and health risks. Mechanisms include non-genomic and genomic effects, for example: activation of intra-cellular signal transduction pathways by binding to estrogen receptors, ERα-mediated activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase with increased nitric oxide release; and anti-inflammatory effects, counteracting TNFα by inhibiting nuclear factor-Kappa-B (NF-KB) and protection of osteoblasts from hydrogen peroxide. A clinical case illustrating treatment of a menopausal woman with R. rosea is presented. Risks, benefits, gaps in knowledge, and future directions are discussed. CONCLUSION: Numerous lines of evidence indicate that R. rosea should be investigated as a potential selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) to prevent, delay or mitigate menopause-related cognitive, psychological, cardiovascular and osteoporotic conditions.",

Recent studies demonstrated that R. rosea had anti-inflammatory activity in animal models, for example, carrageenan- and nystatin-induced edema in rats, possibly by inhibiting phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenases-1 and -2. In addition, R. rosea had antinociceptive activity in thermal and chemical pain tests as well as mechanical hyperalgesia. The purpose of the present study was to assess the antihyperalgesic effect of an ethanol extract of Rhodiola rosea (R. rosea) in a diabetic rat model. Rats were administered a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ; 50 mg/kg, i.p.) and hyperalgesia was evaluated four weeks later. Formalin-evoked (0.5%) flinching was increased in diabetic rats compared with nondiabetic controls Systemic (1-100 mg/kg, i.p.) and local (0.1-10 mg/paw into the dorsal surface of the right hind paw) administration of R. rosea ethanol extract dose-dependently reduced formalin-induced hyperalgesia in diabetic rats. The antihyperalgesic effect of R. rosea was compared with gabapentin. These results suggest that R. rosea ethanol extract may have potential as a treatment for diabetic hyperalgesia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rhodiola rosea L. Crassulaceae, root (Golden Root, Arctic Root) is a high-value herbal medicinal product, registered in the UK for the treatment of stress-induced fatigue, exhaustion and anxiety based on traditional use and used throughout Europe as a herbal medicinal product for similar indications. Numerous unregistered supplements are also available. There are several Chinese species used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), including Rhodiola crenulata (Hook.f. & Thomoson) that is believed to be a common adulterant in the R. rosea value chain. AIMS: The project is embedded in a larger study aiming to investigate the diverse value chains that lead to the production of R. rosea as an herbal medicinal product or supplement. Here we focus on a comparison of the quality of the finished products and assess any phytochemical variation between products registered under the Traditional Herbal Medicine Products Directive (THMPD) and products obtained from the market without any registration (i.e. generally unlicensed supplements). Our key aim is to establish the extent of the problem in terms of adulteration of consumer products claiming to contain R. rosea (or R. crenulata). METHODS: Approximately 40 commercial products (granulated powders and extracts) were sourced from different suppliers. We analysed these samples using high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), mass spectrometry (MS) and (1)H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multi-variate analysis software following a method previously developed by our group for the analysis of turmeric products. RESULTS: We investigate the phytochemistry of the different species and assess the potential of R. crenulata as an adulterant at the end of the R. rosea value chains. The consistency of the products varies significantly. Approximately one fifth of commercial products that claimed to be R. rosea did not contain rosavin (the key reference markers used to distinguish R. rosea from related species). Moreover some products appeared not to contain salidroside, another marker compound found in other Rhodiola species. Approximately 80% of the remaining commercial products were lower in rosavin content than the registered products and appeared to be adulterated with other Rhodiola species. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in phytochemical constituents present in Rhodiola products available to European buyers via the internet and other sources is a major cause for concern. Adulteration with different species, and other sometimes unknown adulterants, appears to be commonplace. Good quality systems and manufacturing practices, including those required under the THMPD, enable consumers to have confidence that products are authentic and meet a high specification for quality and safety.",

METHODS: In a randomized cross-over study, 13 healthy volunteers were given a cocktail with single doses of the CYP substrates caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4) with and without 14 days of pretreatment with a commercially available R. rosea product (Arctic Root, produced by the Swedish Herbal Institute). Four hours after intake of the drug cocktail, a blood sample was obtained, the serum concentrations of the drugs and their metabolites were analyzed, and the metabolic ratios were calculated as a measure of CYP enzyme activity. RESULTS: A statistically significant 21% decrease in the EXP-3174/losartan ratio was found after pretreatment with R. rosea (p = 0.023), indicating a reduced CYP2C9 metabolic activity. The effect was more pronounced in CYP2C9 extensive metabolizers than in CYP2C9 intermediate and poor metabolizers. For the other CYP enzymes tested, no significant effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that R. rosea inhibits the metabolic capacity of CYP2C9 in humans. Although the effect is modest, it might be clinically relevant during treatment with CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as phenytoin and warfarin.",

Self-report measures and cognitive tests were completed at four testing sessions over a period of 14 days. Relative to the controls, the experimental group demonstrated a significant reduction in self-reported, anxiety, stress, anger, confusion and depression at 14 days and a significant improvements in total mood. No relevant differences in cognitive performance between the groups were observed. Rhodiola rosea L (Vitano®) presented a favourable safety tolerability profile. Although this was a non-placebo controlled trial, it is unlikely that the findings were the result of placebo effects as changes appeared gradual and were specific to certain psychological measures.

      "abstract": "In recent years, several studies have shown that Rhodiola rosea can enhance cellular immunity and humoral immune function in mice, and thus, it has become a research hotspot. However, its underlying mechanism of action has remained elusive. The present study investigated whether Rhodiola rosea was able to downregulate the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α-inducible protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2), thereby inhibiting the expression of apoptotic genes, attenuating T-lymphocyte apoptosis and improving immunity in septic mice. A mouse model of caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis was established, and animals in the treatment group were pre-treated with an intraperitoneal injection of Rhodiola rosea extract, while animals in the control group and sham-operated group were injected with an equivalent amount of normal saline. TIPE2, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) mRNA and protein levels in thymic T cells were determined using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Furthermore, the thymus T-lymphocyte apoptosis rate, thymus T-lymphocyte count and thymus T-lymphocyte sub-sets were assessed using flow cytometry. Levels of T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokines [Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-γ] and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were determined using ELISA. The results showed that, compared to that in the CLP group, the expression of TIPE2, Fas and FasL in the treatment group was significantly decreased, while the expression of Bcl-2 was increased (P<0.05). The thymus lymphocyte count in the CLP group was significantly higher compared with that in the treatment group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the apoptotic rate of thymus T-lymphocytes in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the CLP group (P<0.05). In addition, treatment with Rhodiola rosea rescued decreased in the counts of the CD3(+) T and CD4(+) T sub-sets of thymus T lymphocytes in the CLP group (P<0.05), while not affecting the increased levels of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the CLP group compared with those in the control groups. In addition, the Th1 cytokines (IL-12, IL-2 and IFN-γ) were significantly increased (P<0.05) in the CLP group, and treatment with Rhodiola rosea led to further increases. The thymus index of septic mice treated with Rhodiola rosea as well as their survival rate were improved as compared with those in the CLP group. These findings suggested that Rhodiola rosea has protective effects against sepsis by decreasing apoptosis, increasing Th1 cytokines and enhancing the host's immunity via the regulation of TIPE2 expression.",

It is also known to improve glucose and lipid metabolism, but the effects of Rhodiola rosea on adipocyte differentiation and metabolism are not still elucidated. In this study the anti-adipogenic and lipolytic activity of two extracts of Rhodiola rosea, containing 3% salidroside (RS) or 1% salidroside and 3% rosavines (RR) on primary human visceral adipocytes was investigated. Pre-adipocytes were analyzed after 10 and 20 days of treatment during differentiation and after 7 days of treatment when they reached mature shape. The RS extract significantly induced higher apoptosis and lipolysis in comparison to control cells and to RR extract. In contrast, RR extract significantly reduced triglyceride incorporation during maturation. Differentiation of pre-adipocytes in the presence of RS and RR extracts showed a significant decrease in expression of genes involved in adipocyte function such as SLC2A4 and the adipogenic factor FGF2 and significant increase in expression of genes involved in inhibition of adipogenesis, such as GATA3, WNT3A, WNT10B. Furthermore RR extract, in contrast to RS, significantly down-regulates PPARG, the master regulator of adipogenesis and FABP4. These data support the lipolytic and anti-adipogenetic activity of two different commercial extracts of Rhodiola rosea in primary human visceral pre-adipocytes during differentiation.",

METHODS: 57 subjects were randomized to 12 weeks of standardized R. rosea extract, sertraline, or placebo. Changes over time in Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Clinical Global Impression Change (CGI/C) scores among groups were examined using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Modest, albeit statistically non-significant, reductions were observed for HAM-D, BDI, and CGI/C scores for all treatment conditions with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.79, p = 0.28, and p = 0.17, respectively). The decline in HAM-D scores was greater for sertraline (-8.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], -12.7 to -3.6) versus R. rosea (-5.1, 95% CI: -8.8 to -1.3) and placebo (-4.6, 95% CI: -8.6 to -0.6). While the odds of improving (versus placebo) were greater for sertraline (1.90 [0.44-8.20]; odds ratio [95% CI]) than R. rosea (1.39 [0.38-5.04]), more subjects on sertraline reported adverse events (63.2%) than R. rosea (30.0%) or placebo (16.7%) (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Although R. rosea produced less antidepressant effect versus sertraline, it also resulted in significantly fewer adverse events and was better tolerated. These findings suggest that R. rosea, although less effective than sertraline, may possess a more favorable risk to benefit ratio for individuals with mild to moderate depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rhodiola rosea (R. rosea), a botanical of both western and traditional Chinese medicine, has been used as a folk remedy for improving stamina and reducing stress. However, few controlled clinical trials have examined the safety and efficacy of R. rosea for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study seeks to evaluate the safety and efficacy of R. rosea in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study design. METHODS / DESIGN: Subjects with MDD not receiving antidepressant therapy will be randomized to either R. rosea extract 340-1,360 mg daily; sertraline 50-200 mg daily, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be change over time in the mean 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating score. Secondary outcome measures will include safety and quality of life ratings. Statistical procedures will include mixed-effects models to assess efficacy for primary and secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study will provide valuable preliminary information on the safety and efficacy data of R. rosea versus conventional antidepressant therapy of MDD. It will also inform additional hypotheses and study design of future, fully powered, phase III clinical trials with R. rosea to determine its safety and efficacy in MDD."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Conventional pharmacological treatments for drug addiction aim to reduce three most important aspects: withdrawal syndrome, craving, and relapse. Pharmacological treatments currently available for the treatment of tobacco smoking are able to alleviate withdrawal symptoms but are not sufficiently effective in reducing craving and rarely effective to prevent relapse. Rhodiola rosea L., a well-known traditional oriental medicine with anxiolytic, antidepressive, antistress, and adaptogenic properties, has been recently shown to be effective in the prevention and treatment of nicotine-withdrawal symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The present study used the conditioned place preference (CPP) model to systematically investigate, in mice, the effects of a R. rosea L. extract (RHO) and its active compound salidroside (SDS), on the reinforcing properties of nicotine and their efficacy in the vulnerability to reinstatement. METHODS: To study the effects on the rewarding properties of nicotine, RHO (10, 15, and 20 mg/kg) and SDS (0.2 mg/kg) were tested both in the acquisition and expression of CPP induced by nicotine injection (0.5 mg/kg). Moreover, the efficacy of RHO and SDS in preventing relapse induced by nicotine priming (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) and by restraint stress was also evaluated. RESULTS: Results showed the ability of RHO and salidroside to significantly reduce the rewarding properties of nicotine at all doses tested. RHO and SDS also suppressed both priming- and stress-induced reinstatement of CPP. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed the positive effects of R. rosea L. in reducing rewarding properties and preventing relapse to nicotine and evidenced the important role of salidroside in the effects of the extract.",

The present study investigated the effect of Rhodiola rosea L. hydroalcoholic extract (RHO) on cocaine-induced hyperactivity and conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. In a first experiment, mice received RHO (15, 20 or 25 mg/kg, IG), cocaine (25 mg/kg, i.p.) (COC), or a combination of both drugs (COC + RHO15, COC + RHO20, and COC + RHO25), and their locomotor activity was evaluated. In a second experiment, the effects of RHO on the acquisition, expression, and reinstatement of cocaine CPP (induced by drug priming or social defeat stress) were evaluated. RHO alone did not increase activity but potentiated the hyperactivity induced by cocaine. Rhodiola did not induce motivational effects by itself but attenuated the acquisition and expression of cocaine-induced CPP. Moreover, it was found that RHO did not block reinstatement. The results indicate that RHO is effective in reducing the rewarding properties of cocaine but is ineffective in preventing priming or stress-induced cocaine reinstatement. In light of these findings, the benefits of Rhodiola rosea L. as a treatment of cocaine addiction would seem to be limited."

METHODS: Individual dose response curves of the Rhodiola rosea ethanol extract, as well as B-vitamins alone or in a mixture were evaluated in mice in which nociception was induced with 2% formalin intraplantarly. The antinociceptive mechanisms of the Rhodiola rosea were investigated by exploring the role of the opioid and serotonin receptors and the nitric oxide pathway. Isobolographic analysis was used to evaluate the pharmacological interactions between the Rhodiola rosea ethanol extract and each B-vitamin individually or the mixture of vitamins B1+B6+B12 by using the ED30 and a fixed 1:1 ratio combination. RESULTS: Administration of the Rhodiola rosea extract alone or in combination with all of the vitamins produced a significant and dose-dependent antinociceptive response. The antinociceptive effect of the Rhodiola rosea extract (ED50=81 mg/kg, p.o.) was significant and reverted in the presence of antagonists of the 5-HT1A, GABA/BDZs and opioid receptors and by blocking mediators of the nitric oxide/cGMP/K(+) channels pathway. Isobolograms demonstrate that all of the combinations investigated in this study produced a synergistic interaction experimental ED30 values were significantly smaller than those calculated theoretically. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that a Rhodiola rosea ethanol extract in combination with B-vitamins produces a significant diminution in the nociceptive response in a synergistic manner, which is controlled by various mechanisms. These findings could aid in the design of clinical studies and suggest that these combinations could be applied for pain therapy.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of a Rhodiola rosea extract (Rhodiolife) in protecting murine skeletal muscle cells (C2 C12 myotubes) from chemically induced oxidative stress and to establish whether modulation of HSP70 expression is observed. C2 C12 cells treated with Rhodiolife did not experience any loss of viability (p > 0.05) at concentrations of 1-100 µg/mL for up to 24 h. In control cultures, viability decreased 25% following exposure to 2 mM H2 O2 (1 h). However, no significant decrease in viability in cells pre-treated with extract at concentrations as low as 1 µg/mL was observed. HSP70 mRNA levels were up-regulated two-fold in cell cultures treated with Rhodiolife (10 µg/mL), and expression was further enhanced by exposure to H2 O2 (six-fold, p < 0.05). HSP70 protein levels were maintained in pre-treated cell cultures compared to controls but was significantly lower (-50%) in cells lacking treatment exposed to H2 O2 . The present results indicate that Rhodiolife protects C2 C12 myotubes against peroxide-induced oxidative stress through the modulation of the molecular chaperone HSP70.",

Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal group, control group, low dose Rhodiola rosea group, high dose Rhodiola rosea group and Captopril group. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed to determine the impairment of glucose tolerance in the established animal model. A series of parameters including fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), creatinine clearance rate (Ccr), 24-h urinary albumin (UA), the ratio of kidney mass/body weight (renal index) and glomerular area were examined after 8 weeks. Moreover, the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in renal tissues was detected by using immunohistochemisty. At the end of the eighth week, FBG, TC, TG, Ccr, 24-h urinary albumin, the ratio of kidney mass/body weight and glomerular area were significantly reduced in Rhodiola rosea extract treatment groups as compared with those in control group. TGF-β1 expression in renal tissues of Rhodiola rosea extract treatment groups was also significantly decreased as compared with that of control group. These results indicate that Rhodiola rosea extract may have a protective effect on early nephropathy in diabetic rats, which might be related to the decrease of the renal expression of TGF-β1.",

Root extracts of Rhodiola rosea have notable antistress properties. The hypothesis of these studies was that C aurantium (6% synephrine) and R rosea (3% rosavins, 1% salidroside) in combination would improve diet-induced obesity alterations in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. In normal-weight animals fed standard chow, acute administration of C aurantium (1-10 mg/kg) or R rosea (2-20 mg/kg) alone did not reduce deprivation-induced food intake, but C aurantium (5.6 mg/kg) + R rosea (20 mg/kg) produced a 10.5% feeding suppression. Animals maintained (13 weeks) on a high-fat diet (60% fat) were exposed to 10-day treatments of C aurantium (5.6 mg/kg) or R rosea (20 mg/kg) alone or in combination. Additional groups received vehicle (2% ethanol) or were pair fed to the C aurantium + R rosea group. Although high-fat diet intake and weight loss were not influenced, C aurantium + R rosea had a 30% decrease in visceral fat weight compared with the other treatments. Only the C aurantium group had an increased heart rate (+7%) compared with vehicle. In addition, C aurantium + R rosea administration resulted in an elevation (+15%) in hypothalamic norepinephrine and an elevation (+150%) in frontal cortex dopamine compared with the pair-fed group. These initial findings suggest that treatments of C aurantium + R rosea have actions on central monoamine pathways and have the potential to be beneficial for the treatment of obesity.",

The LPS-induced expression of iNOS and cytokines in BV2 cells was suppressed by the constituents of Rhodiola rosea in a concentration-dependent manner. Also the expression of the proinflammatory factors iNOS, IL-1 β , and TNF- α in the kidney and prefrontal cortex of brain in mice was suppressed by the oral administration of Rhodiola rosea crude extract (500 mg/kg). To determine the neuroprotective effect of constituents of Rhodiola rosea, neuronal cells were activated by L-glutamate, and neurotoxicity was analyzed. The L-glutamate-induced neurotoxicity was suppressed by the treatment with rosin but not by rosarin. The level of phosphorylated MAPK, pJNK, and pp38 was increased by L-glutamate treatment but decreased by the treatment with rosin and salidroside.

METHODS: Male Wistar rats were divided into following five groups: Group I received vehicle (saline (10 ml/kg for 21 days) orally); Group II received Rhodiola rosea extract (250 mg/kg for 21 days) orally; Group III was treated with 20 mg/kg MPTP i.p. for 21 days; Group IV received 20 mg/kg MPTP, i.p. along with 100 mg/kg Rhodiola rosea orally for 21 days. Group V received 20 mg/kg MPTP i.p. along with 250 mg/kg Rhodiola rosea orally for 21 days. RESULTS: MPTP induced rats showed behavioral alterations in elevated plus maze testing. Group III rats elicited significant increase in lipid hydroperoxide along with reduction in level of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase and total antioxidants. Histological evidence revealed that MPTP treated rats shown pathological changes like cellular inflammation and vascular degeneration in brain tissue. CONCLUSION: The oxidative stress and related biochemical alteration by MPTP were attenuated by Rhodiola rosea treatment. However, further studies may be necessary to elucidate the precise mechanism to support the clinical use of a plant source as antiparkinsonism drug."

OBSERVATIONS: Administration of the herbal medicinal product of R. rosea resulted in a statistically significant increase of the following pharmacokinetic parameters for losartan: the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), the area under the curve (AUC) and the apparent total body clearance (CL/F). An almost 2-fold increase in the AUC of losartan was observed after concurrent administration of the herbal medicinal product of R. rosea. No statistically significant alteration was observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the active metabolite of losartan EXP3174. CONCLUSION: The data of this study suggest that R. rosea significantly alters the pharmacokinetic properties of losartan after concurrent oral administration to rabbits. A study in humans should be conducted to assess the clinical significance of a possible herb-drug interaction between the herbal medicinal products of R. rosea and drugs such as losartan, which are substrates of both CYPs and P-gp.",

In this study, we prepared a homogeneous polysaccharide (RRP-ws) from Rhodiola rosea and tested its immunomodulation and anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo experiments using Sarcoma 180 (S-180) cells. Preliminary physicochemical analysis identified that RRP-ws was composed of Glc, Gal, Man and Rha with a relative molar ratio of 4.2:2.4:1.6:1.0, and contained 95.14% of total carbohydrate, 2.08% of protein and no sulfate. In vitro experiment showed that RRP-ws exerted a direct cytotoxic effect on the growth of S-180 cells. In vivo experiment, RRP-ws could inhibit tumor growth of S-180 tumor transplanted in mice, and increase the relative spleen/thymus indexes and body weight. Furthermore, RRP-ws also increased the production of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ in serum, and elevated the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ on peripheral blood T-lymphocyte in tumor bearing mice. The overall findings indicated that RRP-ws could be used as a novel promising immunotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Opioid addiction is a chronic, recurrent brain disease that is characterised by compulsive drug seeking and a high rate of relapse even after long periods of abstinence. Prevention of relapse is the primary goal of addiction treatment and is still the major limitation in drug therapy. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the effects of a Rhodiola rosea L. hydroalcoholic extract (RHO), a well-known traditional oriental medicine, on establishment and reinstatement of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. METHODS: CPP was induced by intraperitoneal injection of morphine (10 mg/kg) as an 8-day conditioning schedule. The effects of RHO on the rewarding properties of morphine were tested in mice receiving oral administration of RHO (10, 15, and 20 mg/kg) 60 min prior to each morphine injection (acquisition) or prior to the CPP test on day 9 (expression). Once established, CPP was extinguished by repeated testing, during which conditioned mice were injected daily with different doses of RHO. Finally, the efficacy of RHO in blocking reinstatement of CPP provoked by priming injections and physical stress was also evaluated. RESULTS: RHO administration showed dose dependency for prevention of establishment of CPP and was effective in facilitating extinction of morphine-induced CPP. RHO suppressed both priming- and stress-induced reinstatement of CPP in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, as RHO was effective for reducing craving and vulnerability to relapse, it might be a very effective natural remedy for the treatment of opioid addiction.",

(RrE) and of salidroside (Sa), one of the major biologically active compounds extracted from this medicinal plant, against oxidative stressor hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and glutamate (GLU)-induced cell apoptosis in a human cortical cell line (HCN 1-A) maintained in culture. The results obtained indicate that exposure of differentiated HCN 1-A neurons to GLU or H₂O₂ resulted in concentration-dependent cell death. A 24 h pre-treatment with RrE significantly increased cell survival and significantly prevented the plasma membrane damage and the morphological disruption caused by GLU or H₂O₂, indicating that neurons treated with RrE were protected from the neurotoxicity induced by the oxidative stressor used. In addition, RrE significantly reduced H₂O₂ or GLU-induced elevation of intracellular free Ca²⁺ concentration. The results obtained have also shown that Sa caused similar effects in all experimental models used; however, the potency of the action was lower than that of the extract containing corresponding quantities of Sa. These findings indicate that RrE has a neuroprotective effect in cortical neurons and suggest that the antioxidant activity of the RrE, due to the structural features of the synergic active principles they contain, may be responsible for its ability to stabilize cellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of human urinary bladder cancer increases markedly with age, suggesting a mechanistic connection between aging and bladder carcinogenesis and a potential use of anti-aging agents in bladder cancer chemoprevention. Rhodiola rosea, growing in high altitude or cold regions of the world, has been reported to have anti-aging effects in Drosophila. We demonstrated that a R. rosea extract and one of its bioactive components, salidroside, inhibited the growth of bladder cancer cell lines with a minimal effect on nonmalignant bladder epithelial cells TEU-2. Interestingly, the R. rosea extract and salidroside component exhibited a selective ability to inhibit the growth of p53 knockout primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (p53-/- MEFs) compared to their wild-type counterparts. The growth inhibitory effects of the R. rosea extract and salidroside were, however, attenuated in TSC2 and p53 double knock MEFs (TSC2-/-, p53-/- MEFs), suggesting that TSC2 protein is, at least in part, required for the growth inhibitory effects of the R. rosea extract and salidroside. The R. rosea extract and salidroside treatment of UMUC3 cells resulted in an increase of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α phosphorylation and a decrease of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, leading to increased binding of 4E-BP1 to m7 GTP. These results indicate that the R. rosea extract and salidroside inhibit translation initiation. Furthermore, both the R. rosea extract and salidroside treatment of UMUC3 cells caused a significant percentage of cells undergoing autophagy. Therefore, the R. rosea extract and salidroside deserve further study as novel agents for chemoprevention of bladder carcinogenesis.",

Among the biologically active components of Rhodiola rosea, salidroside was suggested to be the most active compound. The objectives of this study were to assess the toxicity and cytokine modulation effects of Rhodiola rosea standardised solution (RRSS) and salidroside. Quantitative high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis determined the content of salidroside in RRSS to be 4.39% (w/v). Groups of Balb/c mice were fed daily with different doses of RRSS or salidroside, with CAPE or distilled water used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The acute and subacute toxicity tests did not reveal weight differences, pathological changes, or abnormalities in liver or kidney function indices among the treated groups. Ovalbumin-primed mouse cytokine assays demonstrated that both T helper (Th1) (IL-2 and IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines were significantly increased by feeding with RRSS in a dose- and time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Moreover, the cytokine modulation effects of salidroside were less prominent than that of RRSS treatment and not dose-dependent. These findings suggest that increased secretion of both Th1- and Th2-pattern cytokines can be achieved with RRSS and salidroside treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To critically assess the current evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for or against the effectiveness or efficacy of Rhodiola rosea. DATA SOURCES: Systematic literature searches were performed in six electronic databases: AMED (1985-July 2009), CINAHL (1982-July 2009), The Cochrane Library (search in July 2009), EMBASE (1974-July 2009), MEDLINE (1950-July 2009) and Web of Science (searched in July 2009). No language restrictions were imposed. Reference lists of all retrieved articles were searched, and experts and manufacturers were contacted for unpublished RCT. REVIEW METHODS: RCTs testing the efficacy or effectiveness of mono-preparations of R. rosea as sole treatment administered orally against a control intervention in any human individual suffering from any condition or healthy human volunteers were included. Studies were selected, data extracted, and quality assessed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs met the inclusion criteria; all were placebo-controlled. Six trials investigated the effects of R. rosea on physical performance, four on mental performance, and two in patients diagnosed with mental health condition. The methodological quality of most trials was moderate or good. Only few mild adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: R. rosea may have beneficial effects on physical performance, mental performance, and certain mental health conditions. There is, however, a lack of independent replications of the single different studies. Five of the 10 RCTs reached more than three points on the Jadad score (i.e., good quality). More research seems warranted.",

Both procedures require adequately elevated blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which can be achieved by two approaches: parenteral administration of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) or stopping thyroid hormone replacement until optimal levels of endogenous TSH are achieved. Although rhTSH administration does not require hormone withdrawal, it is not inexpensive and carries the risk of secondary effects. The latter option is simpler but induces a profound state of hypothyroidism, which results in physical and mental complaints that may interfere severely with the patient's activities of daily living. Rhodiola rosea is a popular plant in traditional medical systems in Eastern Europe and Asia with a reputation for stimulating the nervous system, decreasing depression, enhancing work performance, and eliminating fatigue, all features of clinical hypothyroidism. Investigators have also suggested additional benefits such as cardioprotection or even tumor growth inhibition. Here, we propose R. rosea as a viable alternative treatment for the symptoms of short-term hypothyroidism in patients with DTC who require hormone withdrawal.",

Therefore animals were injected with repeated administration of morphine (10 mg/kg, subcutaneous) twice daily for five or six days, in order to make them tolerant or dependent. Rhodiola rosea L. extract (0, 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg) was administered by the intragastric route 60 min prior to each morphine injection (for acquisition) or prior the last injection of morphine or naloxone on test day (for tolerance or dependence expression, respectively). Morphine tolerance was evaluated by testing its analgesic effect in the tail flick test at the 1st and 5th days. Morphine dependence was evaluated by counting the number of withdrawal signs (jumping, rearing, forepaw tremor, teeth chatter) after naloxone injection (5 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) on the test day (day 6). Results showed that Rhodiola rosea L. extract significantly reduced the expression of morphine tolerance, while it was ineffective in modulating its acquisition. Conversely, Rhodiola rosea L. extract significantly and dose-dependently attenuated both development and expression of morphine dependence after chronic or acute administration. These data suggest that Rhodiola rosea L. may have human therapeutic potential for treatment of opioid addiction.",

We hypothesized that ingredients in Rhodiola rosea may increase antioxidant capability against swimming induced oxidative stress. In this study, we have identified the Rhodiola rosea ingredients, p-tyrosol, salidroside, rosin, rosavin and rosarin by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer and evaluated their O2(-)*, H2O2, and HOCl scavenging activities by a chemiluminescence analyzer. We next explored the effect and mechanism of Rhodiola rosea on 90-min swimming-induced oxidative stress in male Wistar rats fed with three doses of Rhodiola rosea extracts in drinking water (5, 25, 125 mg/day/rat) for 4 weeks. Our results showed that the 4 major ingredients (salidroside, rosin, rosavin and rosarin) from Rhodiola rosea extracts scavenged O2(-)*, H2O2, and HOCl activity in a dose-dependent manner. The ninety-min swimming exercise increased the O2(-)* production in the order: liver > skeletal muscle > blood, indicating that liver is the most sensitive target organ. The level of plasma malonedialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, was also increased after exercise. Treatment of 4 weeks of Rhodiola rosea extracts significantly inhibited swimming exercise-enhanced O2(-)* production in the blood, liver and skeletal muscle and plasma malonedialdehyde concentration. The expression in Mn-superoxide dismutase Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, and catalase in livers were all enhanced after 4 weeks of Rhodiola rosea supplementation especially at the dose of 125 mg/day/rat. Treatment of Rhodiola rosea extracts for 4 weeks significantly increased swimming performance. In conclusion, treatment of Rhodiola rosea extracts for 4 weeks could reduce swimming-enhanced oxidative stress possibly via the reactive oxygen species scavenging capability and the enhancement of the antioxidant defense mechanisms.",

METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with R. rosea extract at doses of 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 g/kg for 3 weeks, followed by bilateral intracerebroventricular injection with streptozotocin (1.5 mg/kg) on days 1 and 3. Behavioral alterations were monitored after 2 weeks from the lesion using Morris water maze task. Three weeks after the lesion, the rats were sacrificed for measuring the malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione reductase (GR) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in hippocampus and histopathology of hippocampal neurons. RESULTS: The MDA level was significantly increased while the GR and GSH levels were significantly decreased with striking impairments in spatial learning and memory and severe damage to hippocampal neurons in the model rat induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin. These abnormalities were significantly improved by pretreatment with R. rosea extract (3.0 g/kg). CONCLUSION: R. rosea extract can protect rats against cognitive deficits, neuronal injury and oxidative stress induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin, and may be used as a potential agent in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",

Spontaneous abstinence syndrome was evaluated 20 h after the last nicotine administration, by analysis of withdrawal signs, as affective (anxiety-like behaviour) and physical (somatic signs and locomotor activity). Rhodiola rosea L. extract was administered orally during nicotine treatment (10, 15 and 20 mg/kg) or during nicotine withdrawal (20 mg/kg). Results show that both affective and somatic signs (head shaking, paw tremors, body tremors, ptosis, jumping, piloerection and chewing) induced by nicotine withdrawal are abolished by administration of Rhodiola rosea L. extract in a dose-dependent fashion, during both nicotine exposure and nicotine cessation.

METHOD: Fifty rats were divided into 5 groups: normal control, untreated, negative control, positive control and Rhodiola rosea-treated groups. There were 10 rats in each group. Except for normal control group, depression was induced in rats by chronic mild stress. The depressive rats in the other four groups were intragastrically administered with 0.5% sodium carboxymethycellulose, fluoxetine and Rhodiola rosea for 3 weeks. After the treatment, the content of 5-HT in the hippocampus was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. The proliferating cells and differentiated cells in the hippocampus were labeled by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or/and beta-tubulin III immunohistochemistry, and the number of hippocampal neurons was counted by morphometry. RESULT: Compared with the normal control group, the content of 5-HT, number of BrdU positive cells, percentage of BrdU and beta-tubulin III double labeled cells and number of neurons in cerebral hippocampus in the Rhodiola rosea-treated group were increased and recovered to normal level. CONCLUSION: Rhodiola rosea may enhance the level of 5-HT and promote the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells in the hippocampus of the depressive rats, and may play a role in saving injured neurons of the hippocampus.",

In India, this plant is found in the Himalayan belt and has not been completely explored for its beneficial health effects. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-inflammatory efficacy of the tincture extract of Rhodiola rosea roots (RTE). The anti-inflammatory activity was determined through carrageenan-induced paw oedema, formaldehyde-induced arthritis and nystatin-induced paw oedema in rat model. The tincture extract exhibited inhibitory effect against acute and subacute inflammation at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight. Inhibition of nystatin-induced oedema was also observed in a dose-dependent manner. The in vitro inhibitory effects of the tincture extract from R. rosea roots was evaluated against the enzymes relating to inflammation. The enzymes include cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The extract showed varying inhibitory activities against these enzymes depending on the concentrations. A potent inhibition was observed against Cox-2 and PLA2. Inhibition of nystatin induced oedema and phospholipase A2 suggested that membrane stabilization could be the most probable mechanism of action of RTE in anti-inflammation. The findings in this study may provide the use of R. rosea root extract in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.",

The phase III clinical trial took the form of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with parallel groups. Participants, males and females aged between 20 and 55 years, were selected according to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare diagnostic criteria for fatigue syndrome. A total of 60 individuals were randomised into two groups, one ( N = 30) of which received four tablets daily of SHR-5 extract (576 mg extract/day), while a second ( N = 30) received four placebo tablets daily. The effects of the extract with respect to quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire), symptoms of fatigue (Pines' burnout scale), depression (Montgomery -Asberg depression rating scale - MADRS), attention (Conners' computerised continuous performance test II - CCPT II), and saliva cortisol response to awakening were assessed on day 1 and after 28 days of medication. Data were analysed by between-within analyses of variance. No serious side effects that could be attributed to the extract were reported. Significant post-treatment improvements were observed for both groups (placebo effect) in Pines' burnout scale, mental health (SF-36), and MADRS and in several CCPT II indices of attention, namely, omissions, commissions, and Hit RT SE. When the two groups were compared, however, significant effects of the SHR-5 extract in comparison with the placebo were observed in Pines' burnout scale and the CCPT II indices omissions, Hit RT SE, and variability. Pre- VERSUS post-treatment cortisol responses to awakening stress were significantly different in the treatment group compared with the control group. It is concluded that repeated administration of R. ROSEA extract SHR-5 exerts an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental performance, particularly the ability to concentrate, and decreases cortisol response to awakening stress in burnout patients with fatigue syndrome.",

Our previous studies have confirmed the adaptogenic and antistress properties of a single administration of R. rosea L. extract in rats exposed to acute stress. There is increasing evidence that prolonged exposure to stressful life events and depression are both related to significant behavioural, endocrinological and neurobiological changes in human and animal subjects. The aim of this study was to determine whether chronic treatment with a hydroalcoholic R. rosea extract (RHO) standardized in 3% rosavin and 1% salidroside can prevent alterations induced in female rats following 6 weeks of a chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure. This was analysed through the behavioural and physiological parameters of consumption of 1% sucrose solution, locomotor and exploratory activities, body weight gain and oestrous cycle length. After the first 3 weeks of stress, RHO was administered daily by gavage at doses of 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 3 weeks. In addition, the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (10 mg/kg os), which has been shown to reverse CMS-induced disruptions, was used as the reference treatment. Rats subjected to the CMS procedure demonstrated decreased sucrose intake, reduced moving behaviour, minimized weight gain and dysregulation of their oestrous cycle. Treatment with RHO completely reverted all of these changes. The effects of RHO were comparable to those of fluoxetine. Interestingly, neither RHO nor fluoxetine influence the behavioural and physiological parameters tested in non-stressed animals. These findings strongly showed that chronic administration of RHO results in potent inhibition of the behavioural and physiological changes induced by chronic exposure to mild stressors.",

Whether R. rosea is effective in reducing similar symptoms in clinical samples is unknown. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate whether R. rosea is effective in reducing symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). METHOD: Ten (10) participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD, recruited from the UCLA Anxiety Disorders Program and between the ages of 34 and 55, were enrolled in this study from November 2005 to May 2006. Participants received a total daily dose of 340 mg of R. rosea extract for 10 weeks. Assessments included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Four-Dimensional Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity/Improvement Scale. RESULTS: Individuals treated with R. rosea showed significant decreases in mean HARS scores at endpoint (t=3.27, p=0.01). Adverse events were generally mild or moderate in severity, the most common being dizziness and dry mouth. CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvement in GAD symptoms was found with R. rosea, with a reduction in HARS scores similar to that found in clinical trials. These preliminary findings warrant further exploration of treatment with R. rosea in clinical samples.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of standardized extract SHR-5 of rhizomes of Rhodiola rosea L. in patients suffering from a current episode of mild/moderate depression. The phase III clinical trial was carried out as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with parallel groups over 6 weeks. Participants, males and females aged 18-70 years, were selected according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for depression, the severity of which was determined by scores gained in Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) questionnaires. Patients with initial HAMD scores between 21 and 31 were randomized into three groups, one of which (group A: 31 patients) received two tablets daily of SHR-5 (340 mg/day), a second (group B: 29 patients) received two tablets twice per day of SHR-5 (680 mg/day), and a third (group C: 29 patients) received two placebo tablets daily. The efficacy of SHR-5 extract with respect to depressive complaints was assessed on days 0 and 42 of the study period from total and specific subgroup HAMD scores. For individuals in groups A and B, overall depression, together with insomnia, emotional instability and somatization, but not self-esteem, improved significantly following medication, whilst the placebo group did not show such improvements. No serious side-effects were reported in any of the groups A-C. It is concluded that the standardized extract SHR-5 shows anti-depressive potency in patients with mild to moderate depression when administered in dosages of either 340 or 680 mg/day over a 6-week period.",

Two different dosage regimens were chosen. One group of 60 patients (group 1) took 2 capsules orally in the morning after breakfast, and the other group (group 2) took 1 capsule after breakfast and 1 after lunch. Three medical examinations were performed during the course of the study (at baseline, after 6 wk, and after 12 wk). The evaluated symptoms were divided into physical disturbances such as exhaustion, decreased motivation, daytime sleepiness, decreased libido, sleep disturbances, and cognitive complaints (eg, concentration deficiencies, forgetfulness, decreased memory, susceptibility to stress, irritability). A statistically highly significant improvement (P<.001) in physical and cognitive deficiencies was observed in the overall group, as well as in the separately evaluated groups 1 and 2. In addition, the time needed to complete a digit connection test decreased significantly in all groups (P<.001). Improvements in group 1 were more pronounced than in group 2, however, indicating that the intake of 2 capsules after breakfast is more effective than the intake of 1 capsule after breakfast and 1 after lunch. Global assessment of efficacy revealed that treatment was \"very good\" or \"good\" for 81% of patients, as reported by physicians, and for 80%, as reported by patients. Ninety-nine percent of patients and physicians rated safety as \"good\" or \"very good.\" No adverse events occurred during the course of the study. The results of this drug monitoring study are very promising, but they still need to be corroborated by future placebo-controlled clinical trials.",

Recently, increased oxidative stress was shown to play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This study was designed to examine the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts on blood glucose, lipid peroxidation, the level of reduced glutathione and its related enzymes (glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) in the liver of db/db mice. Diabetic C57BL/Ks db/db mice were used as experimental models. Mice were divided into control (n=10), Cinnamomi cassiae (200 mg/kg/day, n=10), and Rhodiola rosea (200 mg/kg/day, n=10) treated groups for 12 weeks of treatment. These type II diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea on blood glucose, reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, lipid peroxidation, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts significantly decreased on blood glucose, increased levels of reduced glutathione and the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in the liver. Extract treatment also significantly decreased lipid peroxidation. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts may be effective for correcting hyperglycemia and preventing diabetic complications.",

However, the mechanism of its anticancer effect is unknown as there have been no cytological studies regarding cytostatics, cell cycle, induction of apoptosis or the mitotic activity of healthy and cancerous cells. In the present paper, those parameters were investigated using HL-60 cells, with flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. It has been found that the extract of Rhodiola rosea rhizomes inhibits division of HL-60 cells, which is preceded by an accumulation of cells at the prophase stage. This leads to induction of apoptosis and necrosis in HL-60 cells, and to marked reduction of their survival. The cells enter apoptosis from phase G2/M of the cell cycle. After treatment with the extract, no chromosome aberrations or micronuclei were observed, which indicates the mild action of the extract. The cytostatic and antiproliferative effect of the Rhodiola rosea rhizome extract, and its mild action, raises hope for its use in anticancer therapy by enhancing the effectiveness of cytostatics.",

      "abstract": "Rhodiola rosea (rose root) belonging to the family Crassulaceae is a popular medicinal plant in Russia, Scandinavia, and many other countries. Extracts of the roots of this plant have been found to favorably affect a number of physiological functions including neurotransmitter levels, central nervous system activity, and cardiovascular function. It is being used to stimulate the nervous system, decrease depression, enhance work performance, eliminate fatigue, and prevent high-altitude sickness. Most of these effects have been ascribed to constituents such as salidroside (rhodioloside), rosavins, and p-tyrosol. It has also been found to be a strong antioxidant and anticarcinogen due to the presence of several phenolic compounds. Adaptogens are plant extracts that allow an organism to counteract adverse physical, chemical, and biological stressors by generating nonspecific resistance. Adaptogens are known to increase the availability of energy during the day, reduce stressed feelings, increase endurance, and increase mental alertness. This multipurpose medicinal plant (R. rosea), with adaptogenic properties that increase the body's nonspecific resistance and normalize functions, has been traditionally grown and used in Russia and Mongolia. Due to increasing consumer demands toward natural health products and the growing interests in the secondary metabolites of plants and their application in biotechnology and therapy, much focus has been put on the rose root and its medical properties. The rose root imparts normalizing influences on adverse physical, chemical, and biological disturbances but is otherwise innocuous. In India, the plant has been growing wild in the high altitudes of the Himalayas. The Defence Research and Development Organization in India has taken on the responsibilities of its conservation, as well as the development of multiple management practices and the development of health foods, supplements, and nutraceuticals in India."

PHASE I: A double blind placebo-controlled randomized study (n= 24) was performed, consisting of 2 sessions (2 days per session). Day 1: One hour after acute Rhodiola rosea intake (R, 200-mg Rhodiola rosea extract containing 3% rosavin + 1% salidroside plus 500 mg starch) or placebo (P, 700 mg starch) speed of limb movement (plate tapping test), aural and visual reaction time, and the ability to sustain attention (Fepsy Vigilance test) were assessed. Day 2: Following the same intake procedure as on day 1, maximal isometric knee-extension torque and endurance exercise capacity were tested. Following a 5-day washout period, the experimental procedure was repeated, with the treatment regimens being switched between groups (session 2). PHASE II: A double blind placebo-controlled study (n = 12) was performed. Subjects underwent sessions 3 and 4, identical to Phase I, separated by a 4-week R/P intake, during which subjects ingested 200 mg R/P per day. PHASE I: Compared with P, acute R intake in Phase I increased (p <.05) time to exhaustion from 16.8 +/- 0.7 min to 17.2+/- 0.8 min. Accordingly, VO2peak (p <.05) and VCO2peak (p<.05) increased during R compared to P from 50.9 +/- 1.8 ml x min(-1) x kg(- )1 to 52.9 +/- 2.7 ml x min(-10) x kg(-1) (VO2peak) and from 60.0 +/- 2.3 ml x min(-1) x kg(-1) to 63.5+/- 2.7 ml x min(-1) x kg(-1) (VCO2peak). Pulmonary ventilation (p =.07) tended to increase more during R than during P (P: 115.9+/- 7.7 L/min; R: 124.8 +/- 7.7 L/min). All other parameters remained unchanged. PHASE II: Four-week R intake did not alter any of the variables measured. CONCLUSION: Acute Rhodiola rosea intake can improve endurance exercise capacity in young healthy volunteers. This response was not altered by prior daily 4-week Rhodiola intake.",

Some physiological parameters, e.g. pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were also measured. The study was carried out on a highly uniform population comprising 161 cadets aged from 19 to 21 years. All groups were found to have very similar initial data, with no significant difference with regard to any parameter. The study showed a pronounced antifatigue effect reflected in an antifatigue index defined as a ratio called AFI. The verum groups had AFI mean values of 1.0385 and 1.0195, 2 and 3 capsules respectively, whilst the figure for the placebo group was 0.9046. This was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001) for both doses (verum groups), whilst no significant difference between the two dosage groups was observed.

The effect was measured as total mental performance calculated as Fatigue Index. The tests chosen reflect an overall level of mental fatigue, involving complex perceptive and cognitive cerebral functions, such as associative thinking, short-term memory, calculation and ability of concentration, and speed of audio-visual perception. These parameters were tested before and after night duty during three periods of two weeks each: a) a test period of one RRE/placebo tablet daily, b) a washout period and c) a third period of one placebo/RRE tablet daily, in a double-blind cross-over trial. The perceptive and cognitive cerebral functions mentioned above were investigated using 5 different tests. A statistically significant improvement in these tests was observed in the treatment group (RRE) during the first two weeks period. No side-effects were reported for either treatment noted. These results suggest that RRE can reduce general fatigue under certain stressful conditions.",

      "abstract": "In experiment on rats with Pliss lymphosarcoma (PLS) it was shown that partial hepatectomy (PHE), a course application of Rhodiola rosea extract (RRE) or combined effects inhibit the growth of tumors by 37, 39 and 59%, respectively, and that of metastases by 42, 50 and 75%. In combined treatment the process of hepatic regeneration was completed in earlier terms versus the animals which underwent PHE, and proliferative activity of the tumor and metastases decreased by 15 and 59%, respectively, judging by the degree of 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA of these tissues. The assessment of clonogenic activity of PLS cells taken in the animals of this group, using the method of diffusion chambers, revealed a significant decrease in this index versus the rats which underwent PHE or which were given RRE (number of colonies per chamber being 4.8 +/- 0.5; 8.6 +/- 0.9; 5.7 +/- 0.6, respectively; in control 13.8 +/- 1.5). The assumption that these effects are determined by factors originating from the regenerating liver was confirmed in experiments with double-layer agar systems. Inhibition of colony-forming activity of PLS cells was the maximum in application of the hepatocytes of the rats which underwent a complex of effects, as a feeder, versus the hepatocytes taken in intact or hepatectomized animals, or the rats which were given RRE (number of colonies per plate well being 4.6 +/- 0.3; 15.7 +/- 1.6; 7.4 +/- 0.8; 8.7 +/- 0.9, respectively; in the control 25.6 +/- 6.5). In experiments on mice with Ehrlich adenocarcinoma, the factors isolated from the liver of animals subjected to PHE against a background of RRE administration and from the liver of mice which were given RRE only, as well as operated or intact ones, inhibited the tumor growth to 63, 38, 35 and 21%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "The effect of alcohol-aqueous extract (1:1) from Rhodiola rosea L. roots on the processes of learning and memory is studied on rats. Several methods of active avoidance with negative and positive reinforcements are used, as well as of passive avoidance. Using the maze-method with negative (punitive) reinforcement, it has been found that Rhodiola extract in a single dose of 0.10 ml per rat essentially improves learning and retention after 24 hours. Significant improvement of the long-term memory is also established in memory tests after 10-day treatment with the same dose of the extract. In the other two doses tested (0.02 and 1.0 ml per rat) the extract has no substantial effect on learning and memory. In a dose of 0.10 ml per rat the Rhodiola extract had a favourable effect on the training process using the \"staircase\" method with positive (food) reinforcement as well. With the other methods used (active avoidance method with negative reinforcement \"shuttle-box\" and passive avoidance methods \"step down\" and \"step through\") Rhodiola extract in the dose used (0.10 ml per rat) had no substantial effect on learning and memory (a certain deterioration of the training process was even observed using the \"shuttle-box\" method, while the \"step-down\" method resulted in deterioration of the memory). The great significance of the method used for studying the effects of the pharmacological agents on learning and memory for the results obtained is evident.",
