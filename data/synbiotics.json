      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma is a complex subject. Previous research has emphasized a possible contribution of the intestinal microbiome in developing symptoms. The use of probiotic formulas brings benefit in treatment of various autoimmune diseases, but the evidence for scleroderma is still not exhaustive. No official recommendations have been formulated on this topic, nor has the existing evidence been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics in patients with scleroderma with a focus on the improvement of symptoms and change in the quality of life (QoL) both measured using validated scales, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) eradication, as well as change in the intensity of interstitial lung disease and occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. METHODS: We performed a systematic search for randomised trials that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of pro-, syn-, and prebiotics in patients with scleroderma. Pairs of authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of the included studies. We examined the certainty of evidence in accordance with the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We screened 1,801 references (after the removal of duplicates), and assessed 16 citations in full text. We identified four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 103 participants in intervention and 87 in control groups. The evidence suggests that probiotic intake may not affect gastrointestinal symptoms measured with Visual Analogue Scale for Gastrointestinal Tract (VAS-GIT) (change in the VAS-GIT: MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.40, low certainty, n=56 probiotic group, n=57 placebo group) and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms measured with The University of California Los Angeles Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium GIT 2.0 instrument (UCLA GIT 2.0) (change in the UCLA GIT 2.0 - total score: MD -0.18 95% CI -0.44, 0.07, very low certainty, n=76 probiotic group, n=74 placebo group). Meta-analysis showed that probiotic intake may slightly improve the social functioning measured with UCLA GIT 2.0 compared to placebo (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10, low certainty, n=57 probiotic group, n=53 placebo group), yet may result in little to no difference in physical functioning measured with HAQ-DI (MD 0.08, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.32, low certainty, n=56 probiotic group, n=57 placebo group) and frequency of adverse events, change in QoL and SIBO eradication. We did not find any studies addressing the effect of pro-, pre-, synbiotics on interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension. The certainty of evidence was low to very low mainly due to high RoB (lack of blinding, incomplete reporting) and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to definitively prove a positive or negative effect of probiotic intake in patients with systemic sclerosis. The results should be interpreted with caution due to low or very low certainty of evidence and would need more confirmation from strain and dose specific RCTs at a lower RoB."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diabetes kidney disease (DKD) is the most prevalent of chronic renal disease (CKD) and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide, primarily attributed to the increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to investigate potential associations between the consumption of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and yogurt and DKD, addressing a critical gap in current research concerning dietary interventions and renal health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2016. Weighted univariate logistic regression analysis, subgroup analysis, and interaction analysis were conducted to assess the relationship between probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, yogurt supplements and DKD. Additionally, the restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was applied to assess potential nonlinear relationships between yogurt supplements and DKD. RESULTS: The study included 2665 individuals, of whom 1044 (39.2%) had a diagnosis of DKD. Multivariable logistic regression indicated an independent association between probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic, or yogurt intake and a reduced risk of DKD after adjusting for covariates (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52-0.96, P =0.03). Subgroup analysis results indicated inconsistencies in the correlations between DKD and probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, or yogurt. Interaction analysis showed that age, gender, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or antibiotic therapy had no significantly influence on the positive correlation (all p >0.05). The RCS model indicated no nonlinear relationship between yogurt intake and DKD. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated significant inverse associations between probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotics, or yogurt supplements and DKD prevalence in T2DM patients. Further large-scale studies with extended follow-up periods are warranted to confirm these findings and develop evidence-based dietary guidelines for clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Modulation of the gut microbiota has emerged as a promising approach for addressing the gastrointestinal and neurodevelopmental symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of four formulated synbiotics comprising Limoscilactobacillus fermentum K73, high-oleic palm oil and whey, on the gut microbiota composition of Colombian children with and without ASD. These components were encapsulated through high-shear emulsification and spray drying. The four synbiotics and their individual components were subjected to in vitro digestion and fermentation using samples of Colombian children gut microbiota. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, were quantified using HPLC-DAD, while serotonin was determined by an ELISA kit after in vitro fermentations. Changes in microbial structure were assessed by the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene via next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results revealed a decrease in the abundance of genera like Bacteroides and Dorea in ASD-associated samples after the treatment with the synbiotics. Conversely, an increase in the relative abundance of probiotic-related genera, including Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Anaerostipes, was observed. Furthermore, the analysis of SCFAs and serotonin indicated that the synbiotic intervention resulted in an elevated butyric acid and microbial serotonin synthesis, alongside a decrease in propionic acid, which is changes considered beneficial in the context of ASD. This evidence suggests that synbiotics of L. fermentum K73 could represent a promising live biotherapeutic strategy for modulating the gut microbiota of children with ASD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly rectal cancer, often requires neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) as part of its treatment plan. Although effective, RT can cause significant gastrointestinal side effects. Because the onset of RT-induced tissue injury can be anticipated, there is an opportunity to apply preventive measures before the damage occurs. This study aimed to assess whether prebiotic and synbiotic interventions could mitigate RT-induced gut injury by modulating the mucosa-associated microbiota, reducing inflammation, and enhancing gut barrier function in patients undergoing RT for rectal cancer. METHODS: Thirty patients with rectal adenocarcinoma scheduled for preoperative short-term RT (5 × 5 Gy) were divided into three groups: a control group (Ctrl), a prebiotic group (Fiber) receiving oat bran, and a synbiotic group (Synbiotics) receiving oat bran with L. plantarum HEAL19 and blueberry husks. The study products were administered daily for two weeks, starting one week before RT. Blood, faecal, and biopsy samples were collected before and after RT to evaluate inflammatory markers, intestinal permeability, histopathological changes, and mucosa-associated microbiota. RESULTS: The Fiber and Synbiotics groups exhibited a significant reduction in white blood cell counts following RT (p = 0.01 for both), whereas the Ctrl group did not demonstrate a significant change. However, there was no significant difference in the magnitude of change in white blood cell counts among the three groups (p = 0.12). Histopathological analysis revealed that the Synbiotics group had reduced inflammation and fibrosis compared to the Fiber and Ctrl groups. Although RT reduced bacterial diversity overall, the Synbiotics group preserved a greater proportion of bacterial species, experiencing only a 25.1 % reduction compared to a 55.4 % reduction in the Fiber group. CONCLUSION: Synbiotic interventions may protect rectal mucosa by reducing inflammation and modulating mucosa-associated microbiota. The effects were primarily localized to the tissue, reflecting the short-term duration of treatment. While immediate benefits were observed, longer-term interventions should be explored to reduce systemic inflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that the administration of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics (pre-, pro-, and synbiotics) may potentially decrease the incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) and alleviate its severity in children; however, recent studies have yielded inconclusive findings. OBJECTIVE: This umbrella meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively assess the effect of pre-, pro-, and synbiotics on AD among children. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed and Scopus databases up to April 2024 to identify relevant meta-analyses. Relative risks (RR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random effects model to evaluate the impacts on both the incidence of AD and its severity, as assessed by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. RESULTS: This umbrella meta-analysis included 38 meta-analyses, with 127,150 participants. The analysis suggested that intervention with pre-, pro-, and synbiotics significantly reduced the incidence of AD (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.70-0.79), which was confirmed by subgroup analyses. The treatment significantly reduced SCORAD score (WMD = -3.75, 95% CI: -5.08 to -2.42). In subgroup analysis, multi-strain probiotics, Lactobacillus, synbiotics, and pre-, pro-, and synbiotics mixtures were found to significantly decrease the SCORAD score, while, Bifidobacterium and prebiotics alone did not show a significant effect on the SCORAD score. The treatment resulted in a significant decrease in SCORAD score among children with moderate to severe AD, but not in subjects with mild AD. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics and synbiotics could be promising interventions to reduce the risk of developing AD and alleviate its severity in children."

      "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that the supplementation of oligosaccharides and Lactobacillus has the potential to alleviate food allergies. In this study, the gastrointestinal tolerance and adhesion properties of three anti-allergic Lactobacillus strains were evaluated in vitro. Subsequently, five oligosaccharides were incubated with each selected Lactobacillus strain to determine which combination could significantly promote Lactobacillus proliferation. The ability of Lactobacillus-oligosaccharide combinations to intervene allergic responses was assessed using a bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and splenocytes co-culture model. The results indicated that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (Lp) exhibited significant resistance to acidic conditions, bile salts, pepsin and trypsin, as well as excellent hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, antioxidant properties, and Caco-2 cells adhesion. Moreover, Lp co-cultured with fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) produced higher levels of short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, Lp-FOS suppressed the expression of surface markers CD40 and CD86 on BMDCs. Additionally, the DCs-splenocytes co-culture model revealed that Lp-FOS upregulated the percentage of Th1 and Tregs, downregulated the percentage of Th2 and Th17 cells, and suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overall, this study highlights the potential anti-allergic functions of the synbiotic combination of Lp-FOS, which will provide theoretical basis for intervention of allergy by Lp-FOS as dietary supplement.",

After the 12 weeks experiment, rats supplemented with the synbiotic had lower serum phosphate, calcium-phosphorus product, serum parathyroid hormone, and indoxyl sulfate levels than untreated rats. The expression of type 1 RNA and protein expression were increased in rats treated with the synbiotics. Our result showed that synbiotic treatment alleviates hyperphosphatemia and SHPT, which are the main risks of MBD and VC. The mode of the synbiotic action is hypothesized to associate with the improvement of the tight junction and gut barrier, leading to the suppression of intestinal paracellular phosphate transport.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials evaluating perioperative probiotics or synbiotics for preventing postoperative infections in patients undergoing major liver surgery. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Outcomes included postoperative infection incidence, antibiotic therapy duration, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. A random-effect model was adopted for the meta-analysis. The quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Ten studies involving 588 patients were included. Pooled analyses revealed that perioperative probiotics or synbiotics significantly reduced postoperative infection incidence (RR 0.36, 95% CI [0.24-0.54], P < 0.0001, I2 = 6%) and antibiotic therapy duration (MD -2.82, 95% CI [-3.13 to -2.51], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%). No significant differences were observed in length of stay in ICU (MD -0.25, 95% CI [-0.84-0.34], P = 0.41, I2 = 64%) or length of stay in hospital (MD -1.25, 95% CI [-2.74-0.25], P = 0.10, I2 = 56%).

Supporting the recovery of the gut microbial community after it has been perturbed by antibiotics might be a promising strategy to reduce these risks. In this clinical study, the effect of a 6 weeks supplementation with synbiotics (Bifidobacterium breve M-16 V, short chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides) after antibiotic treatment on the recovery speed of the gut microbiota of toddlers will be studied. METHODS/DESIGN: A cohort of 126 Dutch toddlers aged 12 to 36 months old, who receive an amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid treatment, will be followed for 12 weeks. Participants will be randomized into an intervention group, who will consume the study product over a 6 weeks period starting at the last day of the antibiotic treatment or into a control group that will continue their usual eating pattern. Stool samples and their characteristics will be collected weekly by both groups. Stool samples will be analyzed for total microbiota and Bifidobacterium spp.. The differences in the proportion of Bifidobacterium out of total gut microbiota, composition of species belonging to Bifidobacterium, and beta diversity overtime will be compared between the two groups to study the effect of the intervention on the gut microbiota after perturbation. Furthermore, the effect of the treatment will also be studied in terms of the gut microbiota metabolic activity and stool characteristics. Additionally, food intake will be recorded to investigate whether diet, especially dietary fibers, may influence the gut microbiota as well. The findings may highlight a potential intervention strategy to support the recovery of the gut community after it has been perturbed by antibiotics in early life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The TOBBI trial was approved by the board of Medical Ethics Review Committee NedMec in June 2022 and registered at  https://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/20358 under the code NL75975.081.20, and at the World Health Organization at https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=NL-OMON20358 under NTR-new: NL8996.",

This systematic review provides a comprehensive summary of the existing evidence to guide future research. Literature searches were conducted in four databases to identify human trials published until May 2024 that examined the impact of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic interventions on faecal microbiota composition changes in overweight and obese participants from Latin American and Caribbean populations (LACPs). Of the 13,090 identified records, five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from Brazil, Mexico, and Chile met the inclusion criteria for this review. The included RCTs evaluated different forms of therapies over short-term interventions (6 or 8 weeks), with sample sizes ranging from 21 to 39 participants across the studies. Variations in the reported outcomes were observed due to differences in supplement formulation, dosage, population characteristics, and methodological heterogeneity. The findings indicate that the available data are inadequate to establish definitive conclusions regarding the impact of biotic treatments on gut microbiota profiles in LACP. Further research with larger sample sizes and precise microbiota analysis is required to elucidate the implications of dietary interventions on gut microbiota in obesity and related disorders."

Synbiotics are composed of prebiotics and probiotics and it possess huge application potentials in the treatment of animal diseases. METHODS: This study examined the effect of d-tagatose on the probiotic properties of L. rhamnosus GG, L. paracasei, and S. lactis so as to screen the best synbiotic combinations. Treat Gallus gallus exhibiting oxidative stress and immune response caused by aflatoxin b1 with optimal synbiotics for 14 days, detect the changes of inflammatory markers and oxidative stress markers of Gallus gallus using qRT-PCR, and identified the intestinal bacteria genera and their metabolites in the cecum of Gallus gallus using gut microbiota and metabolomics analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results indicated that oxidative stress and immune response factor expressions quantity in Gallus gallus decreased significantly after 14 days of treatment, compared with model group, the low-dose treatment group's SOD1, SOD3, GPX1, GPX2, GSR, H6DP, and HO-1 genes in liver were downregulated by 36.03%, 40.01%, 45.86%, 40.79%, 37.68%, 25.04%, and 29.89%, the IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IgA, IgM, and IgG genes in blood and spleen were downregulated by 26.59%, 34.19%, 21.19%, 28.18%, 35.93%, 12.67%, 21.81 and 35.93%, 22.85%, 21.19%, 28.78%, 35.93%, 15.36%, 29.73%. The intestinal bacteria genera and metabolomics analysis results indicated that the abundance of beneficial bacteria genus was up-regulated, and the proportion of pathogenic bacteria genera decreased. The amount of beneficial metabolites associated with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects was upregulated. The synbiotic composed of d-tagatose and L. rhamnosus GG can treat oxidative stress and immune response by altering the structure of intestinal bacteria genera and the production of metabolites.",

Methods: Databases, including PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were searched for relevant randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) until 12 December 2024. Changes in mean ± standard deviations were extracted and combined using a random-effects model. Bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias and evidence quality with GRADE. Results: Twenty RCTs with 1271 participants were included. Results showed high-quality evidence supporting prebiotics' effects, alone or as part of synbiotics, in reducing body-mass index [n = 853; weighted-mean difference (WMD): -0.510, 95%CI: -0.669, -0.351 kg/m2] and diastolic blood pressure (WMD: -2.218, 95%CI: -4.425, -0.010 mmHg), moderate-quality evidence for weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and triglycerides improvements, and low or very-low-quality evidence for waist circumference (WC), fat mass, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), high sensitive-C reactive protein, total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone and free androgen index improvements. Subgroup analyses revealed possible reduction in LDL with prebiotics, as well as possible decreases in WC, TC, and total testosterone with synbiotics. Dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet improved insulin sensitivity. Conclusions: This study suggests that prebiotics may beneficially affect several cardiometabolic parameters in PCOS women. Approximately one-third of the results were based on moderate-to-high-quality evidence. This study highlights the need for future well-designed, larger RCTs with longer treatment duration to strengthen the evidence base and guide clinical decision-making."

Additionally, the vaginal microbiota modulation performs a fundamental role in the regulation of physiological homeostasis and dysbiosis, which provides us a potential overview of the use of different biotic agents and their implications for female health. The objective of this work was propitiated insights and conception about the influence of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics as adjuvants for prevention/treatment on the main infections that can affect women's health. Therefore, seventy-one studies published in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 1999 to 2024 were evaluated and performed to a bibliometric analysis employing the VOSviewer software for scientific mapping and network analysis. Our results suggest that administration of biotic agents as adjuvants are relevant for the prevention and/or treatment of the main diseases that affect female health, since they contribute to a healthy vaginal microbiota through anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Most clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of intervention using probiotics to the detriment of other biotic agents in women's health, being bacterial vaginosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, the main diseases evaluated. However, preclinical studies have emphasized that the inhibition of pathogens responsible for the process of vaginal dysbiosis may be due to the formation of biofilm and the synthesis of compounds that could prevent the adhesion of these microorganisms. Future perspectives point to the beneficial modulation of the vaginal microbiota by biotic agents as a promising adjuvant approach to improve women's health."

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis MN-Gup (MN-Gup) and a synbiotic mixture of MN-Gup and galactooligosaccharide (MN-Gup-GOS) on glycemic control in T2DM patients and explore possible mechanisms. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assigned 120 T2DM patients, to receive MN-Gup, MN-Gup-GOS, or placebo intervention for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was fasting blood glucose (FBG), with secondary outcomes including hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), inflammatory indicators, oxidative stress indicators, gastrointestinal hormones, gut microbiota, and bile acids (BAs). RESULTS: The median age of the 120 participants was 59 years (interquartile range: 55-62 years), with 40 being men. Compared to baseline, all three groups exhibited significant reductions in FBG. Additionally, the MN-Gup-GOS group demonstrated significant decreases in HbA1c, serum insulin, and HOMA-IR after intervention, whereas no such reductions were observed in the placebo and MN-Gup groups. Regarding the between-group comparisons, the MN-Gup-GOS intervention showed a significantly greater reduction in FBG compared to the placebo (least squares mean difference [95 % CI], -0.69 [-1.29, -0.10] mmol/L, P = 0.022) and MN-Gup (-0.59 [-1.17, -0.01], P = 0.047) group, but not for other indicators of glucose metabolism. Additionally, MN-Gup and MN-Gup-GOS intervention, especially the latter, significantly modified inflammation, oxidative stress, gut microbiota, serum BAs, and GLP-1 levels. Correlation analysis showed significant associations between changes in certain gut microbiota (Bifidobacterium) and BAs (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) with glycemic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The auxiliary effect of synbiotics MN-Gup-GOS on reducing FBG levels surpassed that of MN-Gup probiotics alone in T2DM patients, potentially attributed to the enhanced modulation of gut microbiota, BAs, and GLP-1 secretion.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anemia is a common global health problem, particularly in impoverished regions, with a high incidence rate. The condition is multifactorial, with iron deficiency being one of the most prevalent causes. Current treatment for anemia often relies on iron supplements or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, although these therapies may show limited efficacy for some patients. Recent evidence suggests that probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, as microbiome modulators, hold significant potential in the treatment of anemia. These interventions may enhance iron absorption and improve overall blood health through their impact on gut microbiota, thus providing an alternative or complementary approach to conventional treatments. METHODS: Six databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WangFang data library, were searched up to November 20, 2024. Studies published in English and Chinese were included. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics in treating anemia. The experimental groups received probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics, while the control groups received placebo, alternative treatments, or no treatment. The primary outcome was hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Secondary outcomes included serum iron (SI) and serum ferritin (SF). A descriptive analysis was conducted for studies where meta-analysis was not feasible. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of evidence, and the Cochrane guidelines were employed to evaluate the risk of bias in each study. RESULTS: Seven studies were included comprising a total of eight RCTs, with the main types of anemia being iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), involving 632 patients. The analysis revealed that probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics significantly improved Hb levels in patients with anemia (WMD = 10.760, 95% CI: 4.593 to 16.747, p = 0.001), though heterogeneity was high (I² = 96.5%). Two RCTs (n = 120 participants) reported significant increases in serum iron levels in the probiotic group (WMD = 3.835, 95% CI: 3.271 to 4.400), with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 38.7%). Two RCTs (n = 192 participants) reported no significant differences were observed between the groups in serum ferritin levels (WMD = 8.048, p = 0.115), and heterogeneity remained high (I² = 62.6%). Subgroup analyses revealed that probiotics improved Hb levels in renal and iron-deficiency anemia, as well as across different doses. The synbiotic group showed consistent efficacy (I² = 0%), while the prebiotic group did not exhibit significant effects, with extremely high heterogeneity (I² = 99.3%). This indicates that heterogeneity may stem from variations in intervention types, and the results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSION: There is moderate-quality evidence suggesting that probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics may improve anemia management, particularly by enhancing Hb levels. Further high-quality RCTs are required to explore the specific role of synbiotics in anemia management, including their comparative efficacy against probiotics and prebiotics alone, and their impact on gastrointestinal factors such as gut microbiota modulation and inflammation reduction.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diarrhea is one of the most common complications among patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Alongside common medical products for managing diarrhea, attention has been directed toward natural approaches, such as the use of probiotics or synbiotics supplements. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics or synbiotics in the prevention and treatment of diarrhea, mortality, and length of ICU stay. METHODS: In adherence to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) statement, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Relevant articles were identified by searching PubMed, SpringerLink, and ScienceDirect databases. Quality assessment was done using Cochrane Collaboration's tool for randomized-controlled trials (ROB2). RESULTS: 6305 articles were identified, of which 14 papers were included. Probiotics reduced the risk of diarrhea by 10 %; however, the result was not statistically significant [Risk Ratio (RR) = 0.90; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 0.77 to 1.05; P = 0.16; I2 = 29 %; 13 studies]. No statistical significance was found among studies regarding reducing the duration of diarrhea, with considerable heterogeneity [RR = - 0.53; 95 % CI: -1.46 to 0.41; P = 0.27; I2 = 71 %, 5 studies]. Neither the length of ICU stays nor the mortality rate was affected by the use of probiotics or synbiotics. CONCLUSION: Probiotics or synbiotics appear to slightly reduce the incidence of diarrhea among ICU patients. However, this effect is considered statistically significant only after conducting sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Further high-quality clinical trials are required to evaluate the potential of probiotics or synbiotics in the treatment of diarrhea among critically ill patients.",

Recent research suggests that probiotics and synbiotics may improve these parameters by modulating the gut microbiota. This study systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic supplementation on insulin resistance and hormonal parameters in women with PCOS. Methods: Exhaustive searches were conducted in PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, following PRISMA guidelines. Randomized trials assessing supplementation with probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics for at least 8 weeks in women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria were included. Data on participants, interventions, and outcomes related to insulin resistance and hormones were extracted. Results: Eleven studies from Iran involving overweight or obese women aged 15 to 48 were included. Probiotic and synbiotic supplementation showed significant improvements in insulin resistance (reductions in HOMA-IR, fasting glucose, and insulin), lipid profiles (decreased LDL and triglycerides; increased HDL), and hormonal balance (increased SHBG, decreased total testosterone). Synbiotics had more pronounced effects than probiotics or prebiotics alone. Adherence was high, and side effects were minimal. Conclusions: Despite promising results, limitations such as small sample sizes, homogeneous populations, and short intervention durations limit the generalization of the findings. Larger, longer, multicenter trials with diverse populations and standardized methodologies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of synbiotics in managing PCOS. Integrating these interventions could improve clinical management and quality of life for affected women, but additional evidence is required to support widespread use.",

      "abstract": "The human gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of microbes that affect the body. Dysbiosis in the composition of gut microbiota is one of the leading causes of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a global public health challenge and millions of people in the world are suffering from this disease. It is a recurring inflammatory disease that affects different parts of the human digestive system. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main types of IBD with similar clinical symptoms. The increasing incidence and severity of IBD require new treatment methods. The composition of the gut microbiota can be modified using dietary supplements such as prebiotics and bacterial supplements called probiotics. Furthermore, the effects of the microbiome can be improved by using paraprobiotics (non-viable, inactivated bacteria or their components) and/or postbiotics (products of bacterial metabolism).",

Therefore, this study explores how postnatal synbiotic supplementation affects allergic asthma symptoms in house-dust-mite (HDM)- challenged offspring maternally exposed to CS. In HDM-allergic offspring of CS-exposed dams, lung resistance was elevated, but synbiotic supplementation effectively reduced this resistance. Elevated eosinophil BALF counts following HDM challenge were intensified in pups maternally exposed to CS. Similarly, Th2 cell activation and serum IgE and IgG1 levels were more pronounced in HDM-allergic offspring of CS-exposed mothers. Synbiotics reduced eosinophil numbers and serum IgE and IgG1, and tended to decrease Th2 cell infiltration and activation. Synbiotics promoted beneficial gut bacteria like Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia. In conclusion, early-life synbiotic intervention mitigated allergic asthma associated with maternal air pollution exposure, highlighting the potential of synbiotics for clinical evaluation as a strategy to prevent allergy development in offspring.",

The outcome measures included chemotherapy-related complications and the the incidence of gut microbiotas. Fifteen studies were finally eligible for meta-analysis, involving 1356 patients. Meta-analysis results showed that the the incidence rates of chemotherapy-related complications such as nausea and vomiting [RR = 0.61, 95% CI (0.46,0.82), P = 0.0008] and diarrhea [RR = 0.47, 95% CI (0.32,0.68), P < 0.001] were significantly reduced after probiotic intervention. The number of intestinal flora changed significantly after intervention, such as bifidobacterium [SMD = 1.33, 95% CI (0.52,2.31), P = 0.001], Escherichia coli [SMD = -0.82, 95% CI (-1.26, -0.38), P = 0.0003], and the difference was statistically significant. Probiotics or synbiotics supplementation can reduce chemotherapy-induced complications in patients with gastrointestinal cancer and regulate the number of gut microbiotas to balance the intestinal microecology of the body."

The prevalence of this condition is high and there is a need to develop strategies to reduce it. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics may be an alternative treatment for chronic functional constipation. METHODS: To compare the efficacy of dietary supplementation on symptoms of patients who suffer from chronic functional constipation. An exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial was conducted with 74 patients diagnosed with chronic functional constipation who were divided into four treatment groups-Group A: probiotics; Group B: prebiotics; Group C: synbiotics; Group D: placebo. Each patient was treated for 8 weeks. At the beginning and end of treatment, data were collected by administering questionnaires and scales, including the Bristol stool scale, on gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel movements, and sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics. RESULTS: Stool frequency increased in all four study groups, and greatest difference was observed in the synbiotics group (2.8 ± 1.3 vs. 5.9 ± 2.6; P < 0.001). Stool consistency improved only in the active treatment groups. Based on the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, participants treated with prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics showed the greatest improvement in abdominal pain (8.28 ± 2.63 vs. 6.56 ± 2.62; P = 0.009), gastroesophageal reflux (4.60 ± 2.66 vs. 3.45 ± 2.42; P = 0.039) and constipation symptoms (13.00 ± 3.97 vs. 8.71 ± 3.35; P = 0.003), respectively. As for quality of life, the main changes were observed in physical health domains, with a placebo effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence supporting the efficacy of dietary supplementation with probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in patients with chronic functional constipation after 8 weeks of treatment."

This study was conducted to assess the effects of supplementing broilers with a Symbiotic-Enzyme complex (SEC) containing prebiotics (mannose oligosaccharides), probiotics (Clostridium butyricum and Bacillus subtilis), and enzymes (glucose oxidase, and α-galactosidase) as an alternative to antibiotics on growth performance, carcass and meat quality traits, mortality, linear body measurements, intestinal morphology and immune organ indexes. METHOD: A total of 864 mixed-sex 1-day-old arbor acres (AA+) broilers were allocated to 8 experimental groups replicated 9 times with 12 chickens per replicate. These included 6 treatment groups with SEC inclusion levels of 0.025, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10%, respectively, and two control groups: a negative control group containing a basal diet only and the positive control group (Antibiotics group) containing a basal diet and antibiotic oxytetracycline added at 0.2%. Growth performance was measured on day 21 and 42, and the mortality, carcass, meat quality traits, linear body measurements, intestinal morphology, and organ size indexes were measured on day 42. RESULTS: The results indicated that supplementing broilers with 0.1% SEC resulted in insignificant (P > 0.05) increases in average daily feed intake (ADFI), significant (P < 0.05) increases in the average daily gains (ADG), and significant (P < 0.05) reduction in a feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) in all the phases compared to the control and antibiotics groups. Supplementation of broilers with 0.1% SEC inclusion levels also significantly (P < 0.05) increased the body slope length, chest width, chest depth, keel length, and shank circumference. Furthermore, broilers on diets containing 0.1% SEC inclusion level also had significantly (P < 0.05) higher dressed, semi-evisceration, evisceration, and breast muscle percentages. Including SEC at 0.1% also significantly (P < 0.05) increased villus height and villus-to-crypt ratio (V/C) but reduced crypt depth in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum compared to the control groups. SEC inclusion at 0.1% significantly (P < 0.05) increased the spleen, bursal, and thymus indexes, respectively. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of broilers with 0.1% SEC can be used as an antibiotic alternative because it increases the F/G, improves the carcass and meat quality, increases the body conformation, improves the small intestines' functions, and immune organ size."

The research involved 120 female BIG 6 turkeys, divided into six treatment groups (five replicates, four birds per replicate). Wheat naturally contaminated with OTA (662.03 μg/kg) was used in turkey diets. Turkeys in group 1 received an OTA-contaminated diet without additives. Groups 2 and 3 received 0.4 g/kg of probiotic preparation BioPlus 2B or Cylactin. Groups 4, 5, and 6 received 0.5 g/kg of synbiotics S1, S2, or S3. The following parameters were monitored: growth performance, carcass quality, gastrointestinal tract structure and digesta pH, health status, and concentrations of OTA in the blood and tissues of turkeys. The study found no significant differences in the growth performance and carcass quality of turkey. However, the introduction of probiotics or synbiotics into OTA-contaminated feed mixtures resulted in a reduced pH of the digesta in certain sections of the turkey digestive tract (p < 0.05). Additionally, the tested synbiotic additives significantly reduced liver weight in turkeys at weeks 6 and 15 (p < 0.05). The addition of probiotic and synbiotic preparations based on lactic acid bacteria strains, inulin, and S. cerevisiae yeasts to OTA-contaminated diets in commercial turkey farming may improve health status (p < 0.05) and reduce mycotoxin accumulation in organs and tissues of poultry (p < 0.05)."

Trehalose alleviates damage to the body by endowing it with stress resistance. In this study, we used trehalose combined with Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to explore whether dietary intervention can alleviate oxidative stress and inflammatory damage in early lactation and to evaluate the growth ability, acid production ability, antioxidant ability, non-specific adhesion ability, antibacterial ability, and other parameters to determine the optimal combinations and proportions. The results showed that the synbiotics composed of 2.5% trehalose and 1 × 107 cfu/g of Bifidobacterium longum could regulate the gut microbiota, and promote mammary gland development in dams by reducing progesterone (PROG) content in the blood, increasing prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) content, enhancing their antioxidant and immune abilities, and effectively increasing the weight and lactation of early lactating dams. In addition, it can also affect the growth of offspring and the development of the intestinal barrier. These results indicate that trehalose synbiotics have great potential in alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory damage in early lactation."

      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects various organs in the body. In SLE, inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory process. Synbiotics may help modulate these inflammatory cytokines. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial aimed to assess the impact of synbiotics intervention on interleukin-17A (IL-17A) levels, disease activity, and inflammatory factors in patients with SLE. Fifty SLE patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard therapy plus synbiotics (consisting of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus reuteri, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and the prebiotic fructooligosaccharides) or standard therapy alone for 2 months. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in both protein and mRNA levels of IL-17A, as well as in the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 score, within the synbiotics group after the intervention compared to baseline. In contrast, the placebo group did not experience significant changes in IL-17A levels or disease activity. Synbiotic supplementation shows potential as an adjunctive therapeutic approach for SLE management; however, further research is needed to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study explores the use of synbiotics as a supplementary treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, which is typically managed with immunosuppressive therapies.",

DGBI are highly prevalent in autistic children and are associated with worsening behaviour and anxiety. Treatments such as probiotics, prebiotics and gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) have shown efficacy in improving gut symptoms in children. The primary objective of the study was to compare changes in gastrointestinal (GI) scores following a 12-week intervention of synbiotics (prebiotic + probiotic) +/- GDH with a follow-up at 24 weeks. Secondary objectives included changes in behavioural and anxiety symptoms, while changes in gut microbiome composition were assessed as an exploratory objective. Children diagnosed with ASD aged 5.00-10.99 years (n = 40) were recruited and randomised (1:1) to a 12-week intervention of either synbiotics (SYN group) or synbiotics + GDH (COM group). Both the SYN and COM group experienced significant reductions in total GI scores post-intervention and at follow-up (p < 0.001), with no superiority of the COM treatment over the SYN treatment. The COM group showed beneficial reductions in anxiety scores (p = 0.002) and irritability behaviours (p < 0.001) which were not present in the SYN group. At follow-up, only those in the COM group maintained significant reductions in GI pain scores (p < 0.001). There were significant changes in gut microbiota such as increases in Bifidobacterium animalis and Dialister in both groups over time. In conclusion, synbiotics with or without GDH may help support standard care for autistic children who suffer comorbid DGBI.

Synbiotics, a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics, aim to improve the balance of bacteria in the gut microbiome. This study aimed to assess the effect of synbiotics on the treatment of DRE and the burden on caregivers. METHODS: This one-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in Arak, Iran. Thirty children with DRE, diagnosed by a pediatric neurologist and meeting the inclusion criteria in 2021-22, were included in the study. In addition to anticonvulsant drugs, infants were administered PediLact at a dose of 5-15 drops per day for eight weeks, and KidiLact at a dose of one sachet per day for eight weeks for children aged 2-15 years. Both PediLact and KidiLact are synbiotics. To investigate the burden on caregivers (parents), the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview was conducted. In addition, the number of epileptic seizures was assessed from mothers before and immediately after the intervention over one month. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants in the study was 8.6 years (SD: 3.4). Eighteen participants (60%) were boys, and 12 (40%) were girls. The results of the study showed a statistically significant decrease in the mean burden on caregivers, from 34.20 (SD: 14.4) before the intervention to 30.26 (SD: 15.8) after the intervention (P = 0.017). The mean frequency of seizures decreased significantly, from 15.83 (SD: 12.9) before the intervention to 12.73 (SD: 12.8) after the intervention (P = 0.001). Following the intervention, the seizure frequency stopped in two patients, decreased by 50% in six patients, increased in one patient, and remained unchanged in 21 patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Symbiotics in DRE patients are associated with a lower parental burden of caregivers and seizure frequency. Well-designed randomized clinical trial studies are recommended to generate rigorous causal evidence and conclusions.",

This systematic review evaluates their intervention effects through a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Searches of 4 electronic databases until January 7, 2024, yielded 17 papers reporting on 15 RCTs involving 820 participants. Multiple-strain probiotics (MSP) showed significant efficacy in reducing BMI (Mean Difference (MD) -2.13 kg/m2, 95% credible interval (CrI) [-2.7, -1.57]), waist circumference (MD -1.34 cm, 95% CrI [-2.33, -0.35]), total cholesterol (MD -6.55 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-10.61, -2.45]), triglycerides (MD -3.71 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-5.76, -1.67]), leptin (MD -3.99 ng/mL, 95% CrI [-4.68, -3.3]), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) (MD -1.21 mg/L, 95% CrI [-1.45, -0.97]). Synbiotics were effective in reducing BMI-z score (MD -0.07, 95% CrI [-0.10, -0.04]) and LDL-C (MD -1.54 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-1.98, -1.09]) but led to a slight increase in fasting glucose (MD 1.12 mg/dL, 95% CrI [0.75, 1.49]). Single-ingredient prebiotics and single-strain probiotics also had some beneficial effects on BMI and Hs-CRP, respectively. Moderate to low evidence suggests MSP may be a potential choice for improving BMI and reducing lipids, leptin, and Hs-CRP levels, implying that MSP could aid in managing pediatric obesity and related metabolic issues by modulating the gut microbiota. Although synbiotics show their favorable effects on body metrics and lipid control, their potential impact on blood glucose currently prevents them from being an alternative to MSP for treating pediatric obesity. Further large-scale, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings."

A total of 76 patients were recruited and completed the course of the intervention between 2019 and 2021 in Kerman, Iran. breast cancer patients were randomly enrolled in this study. Patients divided into four groups to receive one of the following regimens: placebo, vitamin D, synbiotics and a combination of vitamin D and synbiotics. clinicopathologic parameters, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and hormonal levels were measured at the baseline and four months after intervention. The study results found no clear link between the interventions and achieving pathological complete response (pCR), and a similar trend was observed in Ki-67 index examination. After neoadjuvant therapy, TNF-α concentrations decreased, with vitamin D supplementation moderating this decline. Vitamin D supplemented groups showed a significant increase in serum IL-6 levels. While IL-10 levels decreased in the placebo group, all intervention groups were protected from this decline. Moreover, there was a notable increase in the anti-inflammatory index, particularly in the group receiving both vitamin D and synbiotic supplementation, suggesting potential synergistic anti-inflammatory effects from their combined administration. The outcomes suggest a potential anti-inflammatory function of this combination. Consequently, more extensive studies with prolonged follow-up periods and substantial sample sizes are warranted to thoroughly evaluate their potential benefits for breast cancer patients.",

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for relevant trials published up to March 2024. Out of 3369 identified studies, 24 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Results: Probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic supplementation substantially reduced FBG (n = 23; standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.30, -0.03; P = 0.02), fasting insulin levels (n = 12; SMD = -0.28; 95% CI: -0.49, -0.07; P = 0.01), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; n = 14; SMD = -0.28; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.09; P = 0.004). However, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c; n = 3; SMD = -0.17; 95% CI: -0.48, 0.13; P = 0.27) was not significantly affected. The FBG-decreasing effect diminished as the body mass index (BMI) of volunteers increased in the baseline. Additionally, the number of probiotic strains and geographic region were shown to significantly affect FBG levels. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that supplementation with probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics may aid in controlling glucose homeostasis in patients with NAFLD.",

The Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences, and PubMed databases were systematically searched to define the clinical trials published up to November 2022 in the English language. The comparison of the incidence of COVID-19 disease and levels of specific antibodies against SARS-cov2 between the intervention and placebo groups were evaluated in this systematic review.Results: According to the five included trials, four indicated the incidence of COVID-19, and no significant differences were observed between the probiotic and placebo groups during 1, 2, or 3 months of follow-up in the mentioned studies. Regarding the antibody assays against SARS-Cov2 including IgM, IgG, or IgA reported by three eligible trials, there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups.Conclusion: It seems that the administration of single or multi-strain probiotics or synbiotics had no prophylactic effects in different populations such as high-risk staff exposed to COVID-19, elderly nursing home residents, healthy adults, and household contact with COVID-19 patients during 1-to-3-months of intervention.",

The role of gut biotics in modulating the gut-brain axis is becoming evident with more research focusing on this intervention. Improvement of gut-organ axis function is possible by using food-related products called gut biotics. However, there is limited comprehension of the knowledge and use of these intestinal or gut biotics. Our aim was to recognize knowledge gaps and assess the improvement of understanding following an education intervention. METHODS: A single-arm study encompassing a convenient sample of 161 inpatient and outpatient subjects aged 50 years and older was conducted at the University of Alberta Hospital from June to August 2023. Knowledge about gut biotics was evaluated using a structured questionnaire consisting of 16 questions and involving six thematic areas. To ensure validity, the questionnaire was pre-tested on 10 physicians and residents who were not part of the study. The questionnaire was administered to study subjects prior to receiving an information sheet about gut biotics. Two weeks after receiving the information sheet, all participants were contacted by phone, and the same questionnaire was administered again. Of the 161 patients, 122 completed the pre-intervention and post-intervention questionnaires and were considered in the analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 72 years (SD: 10.8), 57% comprised women, and 39% had less than a high school education. The proportion of polypharmacy and multimorbidity was 87% and 97%, respectively. Following the intervention, there was a noticeable enhancement in knowledge across all the themes, with statistical significance (p<0.001) observed in 14 out of 16 questions as determined by the homogeneity statistical test. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gaps in gut biotics were prevalent among study participants, and the educational intervention effectively contributed to the enhancement of knowledge. The results of this study provide valuable information for the development of targeted health education strategies focusing on gut biotics, which may play a role in improving gut-organ axis function."

This study examined the effects of perioperative synbiotic treatment on postoperative outcomes in patients receiving early enteral nutrition. METHODS: We reviewed 210 living-donor liver transplantation procedures and retrospectively analyzed the postoperative outcomes with and without perioperative synbiotic treatment (live lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria, and oligosaccharides) 5 days before and after living-donor liver transplantation. RESULTS: The synbiotic group (n = 34) had significantly fewer male donors (38.2% vs. 61.9%, p = 0.011) and a higher proportion of ABO-incompatible grafts (52.9% vs. 25.6%, p = 0.021) than the non-synbiotic group (n = 176). The incidence of sepsis was significantly lower in the synbiotic group than in the non-synbiotic group (0% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.029), with a lower incidence rate of sepsis due to bacteremia with intestinal bacteria (0% vs. 4.6%, p = 0.089). There were no significant differences in the proportions of acute rejection, small-for-size graft syndrome, or postoperative liver function between the two groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the graft survival rates after LDLT between two groups. (p = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Perioperative synbiotic treatment prevents post-transplant sepsis, even with early enteral nutrition.",

During aging, the bacterial composition evolves in reciprocal communication with the host's physiological properties. Many diseases are closely related to the gut microbiome, which means the modulation of the gut microbiome can promote the disease targeting remote organs. This review explores the intricate interaction between the gut microbiome and other organs, and their improvement from disease by prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. Each section of the review is supported by clinical trials that substantiate the benefits of modulation the gut microbiome through dietary intervention for improving primary health outcomes across various axes with the gut. In conclusion, the review underscores the significant potential of targeting the gut microbiome for therapeutic and preventative interventions in a wide range of diseases, calling for further research to fully unlock the microbiome's capabilities in enhancing human health."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that represents a major cause of dementia worldwide. Its pathogenesis involves multiple pathways, including the amyloid cascade, tau protein, oxidative stress, and metal ion dysregulation. Recent studies have suggested a critical link between changes in gut microbial diversity and the disruption of the gut-brain axis in AD. Previous studies primarily explored the potential benefits of probiotics and prebiotics in managing AD. However, studies have yet to fully describe a novel promising approach involving the use of synbiotics, which include a combination of active probiotics and new-generation prebiotics. Synbiotics show potential for mitigating the onset and progression of AD, thereby offering a holistic approach to address the multifaceted nature of AD. This review article primarily aims to gain further insights into the mechanisms of AD, specifically the intricate interaction between gut bacteria and the brain via the gut-brain axis. By understanding this relationship, we can identify potential targets for intervention and therapeutic strategies to combat AD effectively. This review also discusses substantial evidence supporting the role of synbiotics as a promising AD treatment that surpasses traditional probiotic or prebiotic interventions. We find that synbiotics may be used not only to address cognitive decline but also to reduce AD-related psychological burden, thus enhancing the overall quality of life of patients with AD.",

While the etiology of the disorder remains unclear, there is mounting evidence that the disturbance of the gut microbiota is at least one contributing factor. This insight resulted in clinical trials investigating the therapeutic effects of products containing probiotic microorganisms. Most studies with IBS patients have evaluated the therapeutic effects of mono- and multi-strain probiotics, but only a few studies have investigated the efficacy of synbiotics (combinations of probiotic bacteria and one or more prebiotic components). This review summarizes the results from eight randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of synbiotic preparations (three mono-strain and five multi-strain products) in adult IBS patients. While data remain sparse, some of the surveyed clinical trials have demonstrated interesting efficacy results in IBS patients. To allow a judgment of the role played by synbiotics in the treatment of IBS patients, more high-quality clinical trials are needed."

The association between the development and progression of CVD and several risk factors has been extensively studied. Among these risk factors, the gut microbiota has garnered considerable attention of the scientific community during the last two decades. In particular, dysbiosis is directly associated with many risk factors of CVD in the host, such as diabetes. Prior research has demonstrated a robust correlation between dysbiosis and the development of CVD. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are considered important regulators of microbiota imbalances as they increase the colonization of beneficial bacteria and thereby alter the gut microbiota. Although these beneficial effects of biotics are now widely recognized, new evidence has demonstrated that target therapy of the microbiota affects many other organs, including the heart, through a process commonly referred to as the gut-heart axis. In this review, we will discuss the potential benefits of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for the beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease by modulating gut microbiota."

This study investigates the therapeutic potential of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) synbiotics, a combination of NMN, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CGMCC 1.16089, and lactulose, in mitigating AD pathology. APP/PS1 mice were supplemented with NMN synbiotics and compared against control groups. The effects on amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, intestinal histopathology, tight junction proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed. NMN synbiotics intervention significantly reduced Aβ deposition in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus by 67% and 60%, respectively. It also ameliorated histopathological changes in the colon, reducing crypt depth and restoring goblet cell numbers. The expression of tight junction proteins Claudin-1 and ZO-1 was significantly upregulated, enhancing intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, NMN synbiotics decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and reduced ROS levels, indicative of attenuated oxidative stress. The reduction in Aβ deposition, enhancement of intestinal barrier function, decrease in neuroinflammation, and alleviation of oxidative stress suggest that NMN synbiotics present a promising therapeutic intervention for AD by modulating multiple pathological pathways. Further research is required to elucidate the precise mechanisms, particularly the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, which may offer a novel target for AD treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The eradication regimen for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection can induce gut dysbiosis. In this open-label, prospective, and randomized clinical trial, we aimed to assess the effects of fucoidan supplementation on the eradication rate and gut microbial homeostasis in the context of quadruple therapy, as well as to investigate the combined effects of fucoidan and synbiotics supplementations. METHODS: Eighty patients with H. pylori infection were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: the QT (a 2-week quadruple therapy alone), QF (quadruple therapy plus a 6-week fucoidan supplementation), QS (quadruple therapy plus a 6-week synbiotics supplementation), and QFS (quadruple therapy with a 6-week fucoidan and synbiotics supplementation), with 20 patients in each group. The QT regimen included rabeprazole, minocycline, amoxicillin, and bismuth potassium citrate. The synbiotics supplementation contained three strains of Bifidobacterium, three strains of Lactobacillus, along with three types of dietary fiber. All of the patients underwent 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT) at baseline and at the end of the 6th week after the initiation of the interventions. Fresh fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the 6th week for gut microbiota analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: The eradication rates among the four groups showed no significant difference. In the QT group, a significant reduction in α-diversity of gut microbiota diversity and a substantial shift in microbial composition were observed, particularly an increase in Escherichia-Shigella and a decrease in the abundance of genera from the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families. The Simpson index was significantly higher in the QF group than in the QT group. Neither the QS nor QFS groups exhibited significant changes in α-diversity or β-diversity. The QFS group was the only one that did not show a significant increase in the relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella, and the relative abundance of Klebsiella significantly decreased in this group. CONCLUSION: The current study provided supporting evidence for the positive role of fucoidan and synbiotics supplementation in the gut microbiota. The combined use of fucoidan and synbioticss might be a promising adjuvant regimen to mitigate gut dysbiosis during H. pylori eradication therapy."

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with gut microbiota imbalance playing a significant role. There are increasing numbers of research studies exploring treatment options involving probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), but it is still uncertain which treatment option is superior. The research was conducted on various databases and unpublished trial data (up to February 2023). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were screened for adult patients with IBS comparing interventions with placebo. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and FMT were assessed for their impact using mean difference and Bayesian network meta-analysis. Out of 6528 articles, 54 were included for probiotics, 7 for prebiotics/synbiotics, and 6 for FMT. Probiotics showed improvement in IBS symptoms, particularly with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains. Prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement. Network meta-analysis indicated the favorable effects of probiotics (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.59) and FMT (OR = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.64) on IBS, with no serious adverse events reported. In short, probiotics and FMT are effective for managing IBS, with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus being dominant strains. However, the most effective probiotic combination or strain remains unclear, while prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement.",

This randomized controlled trial aimed to improve the gut microbiome of individuals with low dietary fiber intake (<25 g/day) during a 7-week synbiotic intervention. The metabolically healthy male participants (n = 117, 32 ± 10 y, BMI 25.66 ± 3.1 kg/m2) were divided into two groups: one receiving a synbiotic supplement (Biotic Junior, MensSana AG, Forchtenberg, Germany) and the other a placebo, without altering their dietary habits or physical activity. These groups were further stratified by their dietary fiber intake into a low fiber group (LFG) and a high fiber group (HFG). Stool samples for microbiome analysis were collected before and after intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed effects and partial least squares models. At baseline, the microbiomes of the LFG and HFG were partially separated. After seven weeks of intervention, the abundance of SCFA-producing microbes significantly increased in the LFG, which is known to improve gut health; however, this effect was less pronounced in the HFG. Beneficial effects on the gut microbiome in participants with low fiber intake may be achieved using synbiotics, demonstrating the importance of personalized synbiotics.",

This study investigated the preventive effects and potential biological mechanisms of SYN (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and sea buckthorn polysaccharides) on DSS-induced colitis in mice. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with SYN has a significant improvement effect on DSS mice. SYN ameliorated disease activity index (DAI), colon length, and intestinal barrier permeability in mice. In addition, RT-qPCR results indicated that after SYN intervention, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-17F) and transcription factor RORγt secreted by Th17 cells were significantly reduced, and the expression levels of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF-β) and transcription factor Foxp3 secreted by Treg cells were robustly increased. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed that key intestinal microbiota related to Th17/Treg balance (Ligilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia) was significantly enriched. At the same time, a significant increase in microbial metabolites SCFAs and BAs was observed. We speculate that SYN may regulate the Th17/Treg balance by restructuring the structure and composition of the intestinal microbiota, thereby mitigating DSS-induced colitis.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of NMN synbiotics, a combination of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), Lactobacillus plantarum, and lactulose, on the gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Results demonstrated that NMN synbiotics led to a notable restructuring of the gut microbiota, with a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the AD mice, suggesting a potential amelioration of gut dysbiosis. Alpha diversity indices indicated a reduction in microbial diversity following NMN synbiotics supplementation, while beta diversity analyses revealed a shift towards a more balanced microbial community structure. Functional predictions based on the 16S rRNA data highlighted alterations in metabolic pathways, particularly those related to amino acid and energy metabolism, which are crucial for neuronal health. The metabolomic analysis uncovered a significant impact of NMN synbiotics on the gut metabolome, with normalization of metabolic composition in AD mice. Differential metabolite functions were enriched in pathways associated with neurotransmitter synthesis and energy metabolism, pointing to the potential therapeutic effects of NMN synbiotics in modulating the gut-brain axis and synaptic function in AD. Immunohistochemical staining observed a significant reduction of amyloid plaques formed by Aβ deposition in the brain of AD mice after NMN synbiotics intervention. The findings underscore the potential of using synbiotics to ameliorate the neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.",

The quality assessment of clinical trials was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and for animal studies, the SYRCLE's tool was used. Our literature search resulted in 652 studies. After removing duplicates and screening the articles based on their titles and abstracts, we assessed the full text of 112 articles, which yielded 20 clinical trials and 30 animal studies in our systematic review. Most of human and animal studies reported an improvement in physical performance, a decrease in frailty index, and a lower reduction in bone mineral density in the intervention groups. Body composition tends to increase in muscle ratio, muscle mass, and reduce in appendicular lean mass and muscle atrophy. Also, the intervention induced bone turnover and mineral absorption, significantly increasing Ca, P, and Mg absorption and short-chain fatty acid concentration. Additionally, levels of inflammatory markers such as IL1, IL6, IL17, T helper 17, and TNF-α exhibited a decreasing trend, while an increase in IL10 and IFN-γ was observed. Prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics supplementations could effectively improve the physical performance and muscle strength and reduce the risk of bone loss and frailty in the elderly."

      "abstract": "Cancer remains a global problem, with millions of new cases diagnosed yearly and countless lives lost. The financial burden of cancer therapy, along with worries about the long-term safety of existing medicines, necessitates the investigation of alternative approaches to cancer prevention. Probiotics generate chemopreventive compounds such as bacteriocins, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which have demonstrated the ability to impede cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and bolster the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. On the other hand, prebiotics, classified as non-digestible food ingredients, promote the proliferation of probiotics within the colon, thereby ensuring sustained functionality of the gut microbiota. Consequently, the synergistic effect of combining prebiotics with probiotics, known as the synbiotic effect, in dietary interventions holds promise for potentially mitigating cancer risk and augmenting preventive measures. The utilization of gut microbiota in cancer treatment has shown promise in alleviating adverse health effects. This review explored the potential and the role of probiotics and synbiotics in enhancing health and contributing to cancer prevention efforts. In this review, the applications of functional probiotics and synbiotics, the mechanisms of action of probiotics in cancer, and the relationship of probiotics with various drugs were discussed, shedding light on the potential of probiotics and synbiotics to alleviate the burdens of cancer treatment.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted for articles published during 2010- 2022 in Embase, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using the keywords \"probiotics,\" \"prebiotics,\" \"synbiotics,\" and \"wound infection.\" The titles and abstracts of 2625 articles were screened, and 22 publications that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included. RESULTS: The current review provides evidence of the beneficial effects of probiotics on wound infection, significantly reducing the duration of antibiotic usage and the length of hospital stay for patients, with no serious side effects reported. Wound infections following various surgeries, such as abdominal wound surgery, colorectal cancer resection, periampullary neoplasms treatment, liver and bile duct resection, pancreaticoduodenectomy, esophagostomy, dental wound surgery, plastic surgery, and burns, are shown to be positively affected by probiotic usage. Although, in some cases, the improvements were not statistically significant, overall, the administration of probiotics appears to be satisfactory in this regard. CONCLUSION: Probiotics demonstrate the ability to prevent the growth of pathogens and maintain wound space sterility by recruiting M2 macrophages, which produce anti-inflammatory markers and enhance the activity of phagocytic cells. Additionally, probiotics can reduce bacterial translocation from their niche to other areas and inhibit the production of bacterial mediators that lead to bacterial invasion."

The aim of this systematic review is to critically examine the current scientific evidence on the impact of modulating the microbiota, through the use of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, in patients diagnosed with CRC undergoing treatment, to determine the potential therapeutic use of this approach. METHODS: This systematic review was made according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing the impact of pre-, pro-, or synbiotic supplementation with placebo or standard care in patients with CRC undergoing treatment. Exclusion criteria were non-human studies, non-RCTs, and studies in languages other than English or Portuguese. Six databases were consulted, namely, Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Scopus, Cinahl, MedicLatina and Web of Science until May of 2023. RAYYAN software was used to manage the search results and risk of bias was assessed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration using the Rob 2.0 tool. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Administration of pre-, pro-, or synbiotics improved surgical outcomes such as the incidence of infectious and non-infectious postoperative complications, return to normal gut function, hospital length of stay, and antibiotic usage. The supplementation of these microorganisms also alleviated some symptoms from chemotherapy and radiotherapy, mainly diarrhea. Evidence on the best approach in terms of types of strains, dosage and duration of intervention is still scarce. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-, pro-, and synbiotics supplementation appears to be a beneficial therapeutic approach in CRC treatment to improve surgical outcomes and to alleviate side-effects such as treatment toxicity. More RCTs with larger sample sizes and less heterogeneity are needed to confirm these potential benefits and to determine the best strains, dosage, and duration of administration in each situation.

Therefore, we conducted an umbrella review to examine their effectiveness on anthropometric, cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review on eligible systematic reviews with meta-analysis (SRMA) published from journals' inception till 13 January 2023 retrieved from seven electronic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science). Methodological quality was appraised using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR2) tool and certainty of evidence was graded into five classes. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed on outcome effect sizes at the SRMA and primary study levels. Extent of overlapping articles were evaluated using corrected cover area. RESULTS: 24 systematic reviews representing 265 unique studies, 1076 unique effect sizes and 25,973 subjects were included. Synbiotics were evidently more effective in improving weight (-1.91 kg, 95%CI -3.45 kg to -0.37 kg, p = 0.02), total cholesterol (-12.17 mg/dl, 95%CI -17.89 mg/dl to -6.46 mg/dl, p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (-12.26 mg/dl, 95%CI -18.27 mg/dl to -6.25 mg/dl, p < 0.01), waist circumference (-1.85 cm, 95%CI -2.77 cm to -0.94 cm, p < 0.01), and fasting plasma glucose (-9.68 mg/dl, 95%CI -16.18 mg/dl to -3.18 mg/dl, p < 0.01). Prebiotics were more effective in improving body mass index (-0.34 kg/m2, 95%CI -0.48 kg/m2 to -0.20 kg/m2, p < 0.01), and HOMA-IR (-0.92, 95%CI -1.91 to 0.07, p = 0.06). Probiotics were shown to be more effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure (-1.34 mmHg, 95%CI -2.14 mmHg to -0.55 mmHg, P < 0.01) improving insulin level change (-0.84 mIU/mL, 95%CI -1.27 mIU/mL to -0.41 mIU/mL, p < 0.01), and the percentage of body fat (-0.66%, 95%CI -0.70% to -0.61%, p < 0.01). For all outcomes, the credibility of evidence was classified as class IV. CONCLUSION: Pre-, pro-, and synbiotics can significantly enhance anthropometric indices, glucose and lipid profiles, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers in individuals confronting obesity. While suggesting their supplementation holds promise for this population, the true clinical impact hinges on tailoring these interventions to specific indications and customizing treatment strategies to align with individual patient needs.",

The aim of this review is to explore the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolic syndrome in adolescents and to discuss the potential use of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and postbiotics for the prevention and treatment of this clinical picture in adolescence. According to the most recent literature, prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics have no clear effect on MetS, but a possible modulation of anthropometric parameters has been observed after synbiotic supplementation. Only one study has examined the role of postbiotics in alleviating metabolic complications in children with obesity but not in adolescents.

APP/PS1 mice were randomized into APP/PS1 and Synbiotics groups, and C57BL/6J mice were used as wild type (WT) control group. The mice in the Synbiotics group and the APP/PS1 group were given Synbiotics and xylo-oligosaccharides for 3 months, respectively. The mice in the WT group were given the same amount of normal saline. Cognitive function was measured. Positron emission computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) was used to detect fasting blood glucose level. Immunohistochemical assay, ELISA, western blot and qRT-PCR were carried out to detect inflammatory factors. DNA extraction of fecal sample was performed to carry out sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis, metabolites sample preparation and Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (LC/MS) analysis were also performed. Synbiotics treatment can significantly ameliorate learning and memory competence by inhibiting Aβ protein deposition. Different bacteria in the intestine were significantly improved and changes in gut microbiota can affect the intestinal metabolism to affect multiple potential pathways after Synbiotics treatment. Synbiotics treatment can activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPARs) signaling pathway and significantly reduce neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice brains. Synbiotics treatment can effectively reduce neuro-inflammatory response through the regulation of intestinal microflora to delay AD development.",

METHODS: We searched eight electronic databases from database inception to July 11, 2023, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that report efficacy and safety for the treatment of chronic constipation. The risk of bias in the included RCTs was evaluated according to the Cochrane tool, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis framework. The analysis was conducted using R version 4.3.0. RESULTS: Out of the 37 RCTs, a total of 21 different types of interventions were reported, involving 3,903 patients. This NMA demonstrated that both prebiotics and synbiotics resulted in an increase in frequency of stool movements per week. Compared to placebo, lactulose (Mean difference [MD] = 3.39, 95% Confdence interval [CI] [1.13, 5.65], moderate certainty), mix2 (consisting of Lactulose and Bacillus coagulans) (MD = 3.63, 95% CI [1.37, 5.89], moderate certainty), mix6 (consisting of Lactulose and Bifidobacterium coagulans) (MD = 4.30, 95% CI [1.04, 7.54], low certainty), and mix7 (consisting of Lactulose, Bifidobacterium subtilis, and Enterococcus faecium) (MD = 4.58, 95% CI [1.35, 7.78], moderate certainty) exhibited a significant effect. Notably, mix7 demonstrated the highest probability of being the most effective intervention (94.8%). Furthermore, when compared to L. plantarum, four probiotics and two synbiotics showed significant advantages in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) score. L. reuteri (MD = -13.74, 95% CI [-22.20, -4.66], very low certainty) exhibited a significant effect in improving the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QoL) score. In terms of safety, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups in all adverse event analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to very low evidence supports the use of lactulose and synbiotics to increase the number of weekly stool movements in patients, particularly highlighting the significant impact of synbiotics in increasing the number of weekly stool movements in patients with constipation. The use of L. paracasei showed improvements in PAC-SYM scores, while L. reuteri demonstrated enhancements in PAC-QoL scores.",

Although hydroelectrolytic replacement is the gold standard in treating diarrhea, it does not interfere with the restoration of the intestinal microbiota. Several studies have searched for an adequate alternative in restructuring intestinal homeostasis, finding that treatments based on probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are effective, which made such treatments increasingly present in clinical practice by reducing illness duration with minimal side effects. However, there are still controversies regarding some unwanted reactions in patients. The diversity of strains and the peculiarities of the pathogens that cause diarrhea require further studies to develop effective protocols for prevention and treatment.

To determine whether probiotics and prebiotics affect children with ADHD, a systematic review was conducted. METHODS: The present systematic review analyzed cohort studies and randomized controlled trials that examined whether prebiotics and probiotics are associated with ADHD. Seven randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Research on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) probiotic supplementation showed that children with ADHD had better emotional, physical, social, and school functioning, and a higher health-related quality of life compared to the placebo group. The studies also showed that Synbiotic 2000 reduces markers of intestinal and vascular inflammation in children with ADHD, in part through increasing SCFA levels. CONCLUSION: The use of probiotics and prebiotics as adjuvants therapy in patients with ADHD is beneficial. Further studies with longer duration, including more participants and a variety of age groups, and using various evaluation techniques such as in vivo observation are required to examine the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on ADHD.",

      "abstract": "Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, including effector response to infection and surveillance of tumors. This article summarizes the current scientific evidence on the effects of supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, precancerous lesions, and various stages of cervical cancer development and treatment while also examining the underlying molecular pathways involved. Our findings indicate that a higher dietary fiber intake is associated with a reduced risk of HPV infection, while certain probiotics have shown promising results in clearing HPV-related lesions. Additionally, certain strains of probiotics, prebiotics such as inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides, and synbiotics decrease the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse effects in cervical cancer patients. These agents attain their results by modulating crucial metabolic pathways, including the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress, promoting apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation, and suppressing the activity of oncogenes, thus attenuating tumorigenesis. We conclude that although further human studies are necessary, robust evidence in preclinical models demonstrates that prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics play an essential role in cervical cancer, from infection to carcinogenesis and its medical treatment. Consequently, we strongly recommend conducting high-quality clinical trials using these agents as adjuvants since they have proven safe."

Differences in CM tolerance development between groups were analysed using a logistic regression model. Results show that the proportion of subjects (mean [±SD] age, 3.8 ± 0.27 years) who developed CM tolerance after 36 months was similar in the group receiving AAF-S (47/60 [78%]) and in the group receiving AAF (49/66 [74%]) (p = 0.253), that is, figures comparable to natural outgrowth of CM allergy.

Two hundred and ten male Mandarah line chicks aged 1 d were randomized to receive one of 7 chicks. The method and dose for 1-time synbiotics administration to the day-old chicks were as follows: G1: chicks on basal diet received no treatment (control); G2: 0.25 mL synbiotics sprayed; G3: 0.50 mL synbiotics sprayed; G4: 0.25 mL of synbiotics are added to drinking water; G5: 0.50 mL of synbiotics are added to drinking water; G6: 0.25 mL of synbiotics dripped into the mouth; and G7: 0.50 mL of synbiotics dripped into mouth drops. Lactic acid bacteria(LAB) were significantly increased (P<0.0001) compared to the control group and other treated groups and had the maximum values after the use of synbiotics via drinking water (0.25 or 0.50 mL). Furthermore, when comparing the treated birds (G4, G5) with the control birds, the Escherichia coli concentration in the drinking water containing synbiotics was significantly lower. In addition, treated chickens at (G7) showed a higher duodenum, ileum villus height (VH), and VH. - Ileum crypt depth (CD) ratio compared to other groups. In addition, birds treated with 0.50 mL of synbiotics in drinking water (G5) performed better in duodenum, ileum, CD and VH. - CD ratio than the other groups. Meanwhile, intestinal tract length and visceral pH did not differ significantly between groups. It can be concluded that the use of 0.25 mL of synbiotics in drinking water can improve the overall health of birds.",

The possible role of the intestinal microbiome on MASLD development has been in focus. Our study aimed to examine the effects of synbiotics on the liver steatosis, inflammation, and stool microbiome. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted involving 84 MASLD patients, defined by an elastometric attenuation coefficient (ATT) greater than 0.63 dB/cm/MHz with an alanine aminotransferase level above 40 U/L for men and 35 U/L for women. The patients were divided into an intervention group treated with a synbiotic with 64x109 CFU of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and 6.4g of inulin and a control group treated with a placebo. RESULTS: Using synbiotics for 12 weeks significantly decreased liver steatosis (ΔATT -0.006±0.023 vs -0.016±0.021 dB/cm/MHz, p=0.046). The group of patients treated with synbiotics showed a significant decrease in the level of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (Δhs-CRP 0 vs -0.7 mg/L, p≤0.001). Synbiotics enriched the microbiome of patients in the intervention group with the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Streptococcus, by 81%, 55%, 51%, and 40%, respectively, with a reduction of Ruminococcus and Enterobacterium by 35% and 40%. Synbiotic treatment significantly shortened the gut transition time (ΔGTT -5h vs. -10h, p=0.031). CONCLUSION: Synbiotics could be an effective and safe option that could have place in MASLD treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dental caries, a highly prevalent oral disease, impacts a significant portion of the global population. Conventional approaches that indiscriminately eradicate microbes disrupt the natural equilibrium of the oral microbiota. In contrast, biointervention strategies aim to restore this balance by introducing beneficial microorganisms or inhibiting cariogenic ones. Over the past three decades, microbial preparations have garnered considerable attention in dental research for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. However, unlike related pathologies in the gastrointestinal, vaginal, and respiratory tracts, dental caries occurs on hard tissues such as tooth enamel and is closely associated with localized acid overproduction facilitated by cariogenic biofilms. Therefore, it is insufficient to rely solely on previous mechanisms to delineate the role of microbial preparations in the oral cavity. A more comprehensive perspective should involve considering the concepts of cariogenic biofilms. This review elucidates the latest research progress, mechanisms of action, challenges, and future research directions regarding probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics for the prevention and treatment of dental caries, taking into account the unique pathogenic mechanisms of dental caries. With an enhanced understanding of oral microbiota, personalized microbial therapy will emerge as a critical future research trend.",

RESULTS: From 13 randomized controlled trials involving 896 patients, individuals with probiotic had significant reduction on homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (mean difference, -0.72; 95% confidence interval, -1.07 to -0.38; I2, 96%; P=.00), fasting blood glucose level (mean difference, -3.79; 95% confidence interval, -6.24 to -1.34; I2, 93%; P=.00), and insulin level (mean difference, -2.43 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, -3.37 to -1.48; I2, 54%; P=.00). Meanwhile for profile lipid, significant reduction of the mean difference was observed in the triglyceride (mean difference, -17.73 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, -29.55 to - 5.9; P=.003) and C-reactive protein (mean difference, -1.93 dL; 95% confidence interval, -2.3 to -1.56; P=.00). CONCLUSION: Probiotic and synbiotic supplementations reduced the risk of insulin resistance and improved glycemic control, blood lipid profiles, and inflammation in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Probiotics may be a viable option for gestational diabetes mellitus treatment; however, large-scale, well-designed randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up periods are required before they can be recommended to patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of synbiotics is emerging as a promising intervention strategy for regulating the gut microbiota and for preventing or reducing obesity, in comparison with the use of probiotics or prebiotics alone. A previous in vivo study revealed that Lacticaseibacillus paracasei K56 (L. paracasei K56) could alleviate obesity induced in high-fat-diet mice; however, the effect of the synbiotic combination of L. paracasei K56 and prebiotics in obese individuals has not been explored fully. RESULTS: The effect of prebiotics on the proliferation of L. paracasei K56 was determined by spectrophotometry. The results showed that polydextrose (PG), xylooligosaccharide (XOS), and galactooligosaccharide (GOS) had a greater potential to be used as substrates for L. paracasei K56 than three other prebiotics (melitose, stachyose, and mannan-oligosaccharide). An in vitro fermentation model based on the feces of ten obese female volunteers was then established. The results revealed that K56_GOS showed a significant increase in GOS degradation rate and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content, and a decrease in gas levels, compared with PG, XOS, GOS, K56_PG, and K56_XOS. Changes in these microbial biomarkers, including a significant increase in Bacteroidota, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia and a decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio and Escherichia-Shigella in the K56_GOS group, were associated with increased SCFA content and decreased gas levels. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the effect of the synbiotic combination of L. paracasei K56 and GOS on obese individuals and indicates its potential therapeutic role in obesity treatment. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of synbiotic FamiLact 2plus on the prevention of VAP in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A total of 80 mechanically ventilated patients were included and divided into two groups of 40. Group 1 received FamiLact 2plus, and group 2 received placebo. The outcome variables were compared, including the incidence of VAP, the time interval between the onset of ventilation and VAP, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the length of stay in the ICU. RESULTS: VAP is documented in four patients (10%) in group 1 and 11 patients (27.5%) in group 2 (P = 0.045). The length of stay in the ICU in group 1 was significantly shorter than in group 2, and the time interval between the start of intubation and the onset of VAP in group 1 was longer than in the placebo group. During the intervention, 15 patients in group 1 (37.5%) and 26 patients in group 2 (65%) developed diarrhea, which was a significant difference (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Synbiotic is associated with a reduction in the incidence of VAP as well as a reduction in ICU stay and delayed VAP."

METHODS: We searched Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and other databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of probiotics or synbiotics on MetS in adults up to July 2023, and used RevMan 5.4.0 software for statistical analysis. RESULTS: This analysis included eleven RCTs (n = 608 participants), and the results showed that compared with the control group, supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics reduced body mass index (weighted mean difference, WMD = -0.83, 95% CI = [-1.21, -0.44], P <0.0001, n = 9), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c) (standard mean difference, SMD = -0.24, 95% CI = [-0.41, -0.08], P = 0.004, n = 10), fasting blood glucose (FBG)(SMD = -0.17, 95% CI = [-0.33, -0.01], P = 0.03, n = 11), but had no beneficial effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (WMD = 1.24, 95% CI = [-2.06, 4.54], P = 0.46, n = 8) in MetS patients. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics can reduce BMI, LDL-c, FBG in patients with MetS, but our findings did not demonstrate a favorable effect on reducing SBP. Future studies with larger samples and longer intervention periods are needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This latest systematic review and meta-analysis aim to examine the effects of probiotic and synbiotic supplementation in critically ill patients. METHODS: Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Database, and the Web of Science. The primary output measure was the incident of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the secondary outputs were diarrhea, Clostridium diffusion infection (CDI), incident of sepsis, incident of hospital acquired pneumonia, duration of mechanical exploitation, ICU mortality rate, length of ICU stay, in hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay. Data were pooled and expressed as Relative Risk(RR) and Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: 33 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, with 4065 patients who received probiotics or synbiotics (treatment group) and 3821 patients who received standard care or placebo (control group). The pooled data from all included studies demonstrated that the treatment group has significantly reduced incidence of ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) (RR = 0.80; 95 % CI: 0.67-0.96; p = 0.021, I2 = 52.5 %) and sepsis (RR = 0.97; 95 % CI: 0.66-1.42; p = 0.032, I2 = 54.4 %), As well as significantly increased duration of mechanical exploitation (SMD = -0.47; 95 % CI: -0.74-0.20, p = 0.012, I2 = 63.4 %), ICU mobility (RR = 0.95; 95 % CI: 0.71-1.27; p = 0.004, I2 = 62.8 %), length of ICU stay (SMD = -0.29; 95 % CI: -0.58-0.01; p = 0.000, I2 = 82.3 %) and length of hospital stay (SMD = -0.33; 95 % CI: -0.57-0.08, p = 0.000, I2 = 74.2 %) than the control group. There were no significant differences in diarrhea, CDI, incidence of hospital acquired pneumonia, and in hospital mortality between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis showed that probiotic and synbiotic supplements are beneficial for critically ill patients as they significantly reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia and sepsis, as well as the duration of mechanical exploitation, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and ICU mortality. However, this intervention has minimal impact on diarrhea, CDI, incidence of hospital acquired pneumonia, and in hospital mortality in critically ill patients.",

Gut microbiome dysbiosis may lead to generation and progression of various chronic diseases. Synbiotics act synergistically to modulate the gut ecosystem for improvement of metabolic health of the host. Probiotics have been found promising against various diseases being safer, effective, as an alternative or combinatorial therapy. Specific combinations of probiotics with suitable prebiotic substrate as synbiotics, may be the more effective therapeutic agents that can provide all benefits of probiotics as well as prebiotics. Though, effective combinations, dosage, mechanism of action, safety, cost effectiveness and other clinical investigations are required to be established along with other relevant aspects. Synbiotics have the potential to be functional food of importance in future. Present review summarizes the mechanistic overview of synbiotics related to gut microbiota, therapeutic potential and promising health benefits for human illnesses according to the available literature.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The potential impact of gut health on general physical and mental well-being, particularly in relation to brain function, has led to a growing interest in the potential health advantages of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics for the management of ASD. A comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review was conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness and protection of many drugs targeted at manipulating the microbiota in the treatment of ASD. METHODS: The present study employed a comprehensive examination of various electronic databases yielded a total of 3,393 records that were deemed possibly pertinent to the study. RCTs encompassed a total of 720 individuals between the ages of 2 and 17, as well as 112 adults and participants ranging from 5 to 55 years old, all of whom had received a diagnosis of ASD. RESULTS: Overall, 10 studies reported Autism-Related Behavioral Symptoms (ARBS). Regarding the enhancement of autism-related behavioral symptoms, there wasn't a statistically significant difference between the intervention groups (combined standardized mean difference = -0.07, 95% confidence interval: -0.39 to 0.24, Z = 0.46, p = 0.65). We observed that in the patients with ASD treated with probiotic frontopolar's power decreased significantly from baseline to endpoints in beta band (Baseline: 13.09 ± 3.46, vs. endpoint: 10.75 ± 2.42, p = 0.043, respectively) and gamma band (Baseline: 5.80 ± 2.42, vs. endpoint: 4.63 ± 1.39, p = 0.033, respectively). Among all tested biochemical measures, a significant negative correlation was found between frontopolar coherence in the gamma band and TNF-α (r = -0.30, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The existing body of research provides a comprehensive analysis of the developing evidence that indicates the potential of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics as therapeutic therapies for ASD. Our findings revealed that those there was no significant effect of such therapy on autism-related behavioral symptoms, it has significant effect on the brain connectivity through frontopolar power in beta and gamma bands mediated by chemicals and cytokines, such as TNF-α. The psychobiotics showed no serious side-effects."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn's and ulcerative colitis (UC) are multifactorial pathologies caused by environmental factors and genetic background. UC is a chronic inflammatory disorder that specifically targets the colon, resulting in inflammation. Various chemical interventions, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biological therapies, have been extensively employed for the purpose of managing symptoms associated with UC. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these therapeutic interventions may give rise to undesirable consequences, including, but not limited to, the potential for weight gain, fluid retention, and heightened vulnerability to infections. Emerging therapeutic approaches for UC are costly due to their chronic nature. Alternatives like synbiotic therapy, combining prebiotics and probiotics, have gained attention for mitigating dysbiosis in UC patients. Prebiotics promote beneficial bacteria proliferation, while probiotics establish a balanced gut microbiota and regulate immune system functionality. The utilisation of synbiotics has been shown to improve the inflammatory response and promote the resolution of symptoms in individuals with UC through the stimulation of beneficial bacteria growth and the enhancement of intestinal barrier integrity. Hence, this review article aims to explore the potential benefits and underlying reasons for incorporating alternative approaches in the management of UC with studies performed using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics to treat ulcerative colitis and to highlight safety and considerations in UC and future perspectives. This will facilitate the utilisation of novel treatment strategies for the safer and more efficacious management of patients with UC.",

Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have recently attracted attention as preventive measures against colorectal neoplasms. We aimed to analyze the findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in patients at a high risk of CRC, outlining the challenges and future prospects of using probiotics to prevent colorectal tumors and providing evidence for clinical physicians in particular. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies published up to January 7, 2022. RCTs conducted on populations with a high risk of CRC who received probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics in comparison with placebo, candidate agent or no treatment were included. The primary outcome was the incidence or recurrence of any colorectal neoplasms. Additional outcomes included their effects on the diversity of gut microbiota and relevant inflammatory biomarkers. Safety outcomes were also analyzed. Two authors independently screened and selected studies based on pre-specified eligible criteria, performed data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment independently. RESULTS: Nine RCTs were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Probiotic supplementation significantly reduced adenoma incidence, but no significant benefit was observed in CRC incidence. Additionally, probiotics modulated gut microbiota and inflammatory biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may have beneficial effects in the prevention of CRC. More RCTs with larger sample sizes are warranted to further confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most frequent food allergy in early childhood. For those infants requiring breastmilk substitutes, formulas with extensively hydrolyzed proteins (EHF), should be the treatment of choice. As there are limited data showing the progression of initial symptoms in infants newly diagnosed with CMPA who are treated with EHF with added synbiotics, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the resolution of symptoms in said infants after 4 weeks of treatment. As a secondary objective this study aimed to assess the impact of the treatment on the family's quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: observational, longitudinal, prospective, and multicentric real-world evidence study. The intervention phase (EHF with synbiotics) lasted 28 days and was completed by 65 patients. Treating physicians registered child´s anthropometry, Infant Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (IGSQ-13) and CoMiSS (Cow´s Milk Allergy Symptoms Score) both at baseline and after 28 days of treatment. During treatment, caregivers reported child´s regurgitation and stools, PO-SCORAD (Patient Oriented Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) and FAQL-PB (Family Quality of Life-Parental Burden). Data were collected using Google Forms and analyzed through the STATA program. RESULTS: 95.4% of the patients showed an improvement or disappearance of the overall initial symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms improved or disappeared in 92% of patients (p < 0.05) while dermatological symptoms improved or disappeared in 87.5% of patients (p < 0.05). The median CoMiSS at baseline was 9, with 21 patients exceeding the cut-off point of 12. After 4 weeks of treatment, the median dropped to 3, and no patient exceeded the 12-cut-off point (p = 0.000). At baseline, patients had a PO-SCORAD of 11.5 (interquartile range 1-23) that went to 1.0 (interquartile range 1-6) at day 28 (p = 0.000). The treatment diminished stool frequency (p < 0.05), improved stool consistency (p = 0.004) and decreased the frequency of regurgitation in infants with CMPA (p = 0.01). The percentage of patients who no longer had any episode of regurgitation increased from 11% to 31% on day 28 (p = 0.003). At baseline, 13% of patients cried more than 3 h per day, while at day 28 that percentage dropped to 3% (p = 0.03). An improvement in the infants' sleep pattern was also appreciated with the treatment. At study onset, 56% of the families reported feeling very overwhelmed, a percentage that dropped to 17% after 28 days of treatment (p < 0.05). The small percentage of families who did not feel overwhelmed at study onset (17%), grew to 43% on day 28 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an EHF with synbiotics for the management of infants diagnosed with or suspected to have CMPA suggested a good safety profile, an adequate infant growth, and improvement of overall, gastrointestinal, and dermatological symptoms. It also suggested a lower daily frequency of regurgitations and stools, and an improvement in stool consistency, sleeping pattern, and quality of life of the infant and his family."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem affecting 13% of the global population. Prior research has indicated that CKD is associated with gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis may lead to the development and/or progression of CKD, which in turn may in turn lead to gut dysbiosis as a result of uraemic toxins, intestinal wall oedema, metabolic acidosis, prolonged intestinal transit times, polypharmacy (frequent antibiotic exposures) and dietary restrictions used to treat CKD. Interventions such as synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics may improve the balance of the gut flora by altering intestinal pH, improving gut microbiota balance and enhancing gut barrier function (i.e. reducing gut permeability). OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics for people with CKD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 October 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) measuring and reporting the effects of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in any combination and any formulation given to people with CKD (CKD stages 1 to 5, including dialysis and kidney transplant). Two authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five studies (2266 randomised participants) were included in this review. Study participants were adults (two studies in children) with CKD ranging from stages 1 to 5, with patients receiving and not receiving dialysis, of whom half also had diabetes and hypertension. No studies investigated the same synbiotic, prebiotic or probiotic of similar strains, doses, or frequencies. Most studies were judged to be low risk for selection bias, performance bias and reporting bias, unclear risk for detection bias and for control of confounding factors, and high risk for attrition and other biases. Compared to prebiotics, it is uncertain whether synbiotics improve estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at four weeks (1 study, 34 participants: MD -3.80 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -17.98 to 10.38), indoxyl sulfate at four weeks (1 study, 42 participants: MD 128.30 ng/mL, 95% CI -242.77 to 499.37), change in gastrointestinal (GI) upset (borborymgi) at four weeks (1 study, 34 participants: RR 15.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 236.23), or change in GI upset (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) at 12 months (1 study, 56 participants: MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.27), because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to certain strains of prebiotics, it is uncertain whether a different strain of prebiotics improves eGFR at 12 weeks (1 study, 50 participants: MD 0.00 mL/min, 95% CI -1.73 to 1.73), indoxyl sulfate at six weeks (2 studies, 64 participants: MD -0.20 μg/mL, 95% CI -1.01 to 0.61; I² = 0%) or change in any GI upset, intolerance or microbiota composition, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to certain strains of probiotics, it is uncertain whether a different strain of probiotic improves eGFR at eight weeks (1 study, 30 participants: MD -0.64 mL/min, 95% CI -9.51 to 8.23; very low certainty evidence). Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether synbiotics improve eGFR at six or 12 weeks (2 studies, 98 participants: MD 1.42 mL/min, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.2) or change in any GI upset or intolerance at 12 weeks because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether prebiotics improves indoxyl sulfate at eight weeks (2 studies, 75 participants: SMD -0.14 mg/L, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.31; very low certainty evidence) or microbiota composition because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Compared to placebo or no treatment, it is uncertain whether probiotics improve eGFR at eight, 12 or 15 weeks (3 studies, 128 participants: MD 2.73 mL/min, 95% CI -2.28 to 7.75; I² = 78%), proteinuria at 12 or 24 weeks (1 study, 60 participants: MD -15.60 mg/dL, 95% CI -34.30 to 3.10), indoxyl sulfate at 12 or 24 weeks (2 studies, 83 participants: MD -4.42 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.83 to 1.35; I² = 0%), or any change in GI upset or intolerance because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Probiotics may have little or no effect on albuminuria at 12 or 24 weeks compared to placebo or no treatment (4 studies, 193 participants: MD 0.02 g/dL, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.13; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). For all comparisons, adverse events were poorly reported and were minimal (flatulence, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain) and non-serious, and withdrawals were not related to the study treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found very few studies that adequately test biotic supplementation as alternative treatments for improving kidney function, GI symptoms, dialysis outcomes, allograft function, patient-reported outcomes, CVD, cancer, reducing uraemic toxins, and adverse effects. We are not certain whether synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics are more or less effective compared to one another, antibiotics, or standard care for improving patient outcomes in people with CKD. Adverse events were uncommon and mild.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a prevalent chronic disease affecting a significant portion of the global population. The substantial economic burden associated with treating AR necessitates the exploration of alternative therapies. Probiotics have gained attention due to their availability, minimal adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness. The present study aims to investigate the role of synbiotics as adjunctive agents in the treatment of AR when added to standard treatment. METHOD: Thirty patients with persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) were randomly assigned to receive routine diet therapy plus synbiotics or routine diet therapy plus placebo per day for 4 months. The data analysis was conducted using SPSS Version 20. RESULT: This study revealed a notable difference in immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels between the placebo and synbiotics groups (p = 0.035) following the intervention. Although a statistically significant difference (p = 0.039) was observed in the changes before and after the intervention (synbiotics and placebo) in the SNOT22 questionnaire, this finding was not observed for the MiniRQLQ questionnaire. For the MiniRQLQ questionnaire, the within-group analysis showed significant changes in activity variables (p = 0.023), ocular symptoms (p = 0.036), and practical problems (p = 0.043) exclusively in the synbiotics group. Additionally, changes in nasal symptoms were observed in both synbiotics (p = 0.006) and placebo (p = 0.007) groups. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that synbiotics supplementation for 4 months can impact IgE levels compared with placebo in individuals with PAR, while also exhibiting positive effects on symptomology."

The therapeutic role of gut microbiota modulation in IBS remains controversial.Aim. We aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics in patients with IBS.Methodology. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1 August 2023, to identify the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics among patients with IBS. Pooled analyses of the effects of probiotics in relieving IBS symptoms were calculated using a random-effects model. Further subgroup analyses were performed by different genera, doses and duration of treatment.Results. Our final analysis included 52 trials involving 6289 IBS patients. Probiotics significantly increased the overall response rate (RR:1.64; P<0.00001), subjective relief rate (RR:1.50; P=0.0002) and abdominal pain relief rate (RR:1.69; P<0.00001). As for specific genera, mixed probiotics (RR:1.41; P=0.0001), Bifidobacterium (RR:1.76; P<0.00001), Lactobacillus (RR:1.97; P=0.0004) and Saccharomyces (RR:1.31; P=0.0004) markedly relieved IBS symptoms. Mixed probiotics (RR:1.31; P=0.005), Lactobacillus (RR:2.22; P=0.04) and Bifidobacterium (RR:1.62; P<0.0001) elevated patients' subjective relief rate. Besides, probiotics effectively relieved the abdominal pain in IBS patients (RR:1.69; P<0.00001). Probiotics appeared to show a remarkable beneficial role at a dose of 109 c.f.u./day or above (RR:1.662; P<0.0001) and started to work at 4 weeks (RR 1.72; P<0.00001). Efficacy of prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS remained uncertain, due to the deficiency of available RCTs.Conclusions. Probiotics have a therapeutic role in IBS. However, the effect of different probiotics varies. The minimal effective dose of probiotics may be 109 c.f.u./day. With appropriate probiotic formula, the therapeutic effect can occur at 4 weeks. These data provide a basis for further research on the optimal probiotic therapy in IBS.",

Those afflicted by NAFLD face a heightened vulnerability to the onset of profound liver fibrosis, cardiovascular complications, and malignancies. Currently, NAFLD poses a significant threat to human health, and there is no approved therapeutic treatment for it. Recent studies have shown that synbiotics, which regulate intestinal microecology, can positively impact glucolipid metabolism, and improve NAFLD-related indicators. Sonchus brachyotus DC., a Chinese herb, exhibits hepatoprotective and potent antioxidant properties, suggesting its potential therapeutic use in NAFLD. Our preclinical animal model investigation suggests that the synergy between Sonchus brachyotus DC. extracts and synbiotics is significantly more effective in preventing and treating NAFLD, compared to the isolated use of either component. As a result, this combination holds the potential to introduce a fresh and encouraging therapeutic approach to addressing NAFLD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of breast cancer and its mortality rate are increasing rapidly among women worldwide. On other hand, the courses of chemotherapy as the main treatment for these patients are too much exhaustive and annoying. This study was designed to evaluate the use of synbiotics (probiotics + prebiotics) supplementation as a safe and inexpensive adjuvant treatment in reducing common chemotherapy side effects in women with breast cancer. METHODS: The current study was conducted on 67 women with definitive diagnosis of breast cancer who were hospitalized to receive one-day chemotherapy sessions, and met the inclusion criteria. The patients were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group to receive synbiotics or placebo, respectively. They received oral consumption of synbiotics supplements twice a day for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the changes in severity or experience of chemotherapy complication, analyzed by intention to treat (ITT). The instruments included 7 validated questionnaires which were used to assess chemotherapy complications in the initiation, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after intervention. Dietary intake was measured by 24-h dietary recall at the beginning, week 4 and week 8. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 24. P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: 67 breast cancer patients participated in the study. 8 weeks after intervention and adjusting the confounders, the severity of chemotherapy complications including unnormal defecation (P = 0.005) and fatigue (P < 0/001) decreased significantly in the synbiotics group compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, nausea/vomiting (P = 0.015), and anorexia (P < 0.001) were decreased at the end of the study compared to the first visit, but it was not statistically significant compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Synbiotics supplementation during chemotherapy can potentially reduce the severity of fatigue and abnormal defecation. It can help reduce anorexia and nausea/vomiting.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The impact of chronic low-grade inflammation in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been studied widely. Previous studies showed gut pathogens' effects on inflammation development in NAFLD patients; hence, hypothetically, gut microbial therapy by administration of probiotics, synbiotics, and prebiotics may alleviate inflammation in these individuals. Several studies were performed in this regard; however, conflicting results were obtained. In this study, we aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of gut microbial therapy on inflammatory markers in NAFLD patients in a meta-umbrella design. METHODS: Two independent researchers investigated international databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, from inception until March 2023. Meta-analyses evaluating the impact of probiotics, synbiotics, or prebiotics on inflammatory markers of patients with NAFLD were eligible for our study. AMASTAR 2 checklist was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Random effect model was performed for the analysis, and Egger's regression test was conducted to determine publication bias. RESULTS: A total number of 12 studies were entered into our analysis. Our findings revealed that gut microbial therapy could significantly reduce serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels among NAFLD patients (ES: -0.58; 95% CI: -0.73, -0.44, P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, this reduction was observed with both probiotics (ES: -0.63; 95% CI: -0.81, -0.45, P < 0.001) and synbiotics (ES: -0.49; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.24, P < 0.001). In addition, gut microbial therapy could significantly decrease tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) levels in NAFLD patients (ES: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.30, P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, this decrease was observed with probiotics (ES: -0.32; 95% CI: -0.53, -0.11, P = 0.002) and synbiotics (ES: -0.96; 95% CI: -1.32, -0.60, P < 0.001). Not enough information was available for assessing prebiotics' impacts. CONCLUSION: The results of this umbrella review suggest that probiotics and synbiotics have promising effects on inflammatory markers, including TNF-a and CRP; however, more research is needed regarding the effects of prebiotics.

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) were searched up to June 2023. Randomized controlled trials involving children diagnosed with FC with Rome III/IV criteria were included. Treatment success, defecation frequency, stool consistency, painful defecation, fecal incontinence, and adverse events were assessed as outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous and continuous variables as appropriate. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool version 2 assessed the risk of bias. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs with 1504 patients were included. Compared to placebo, probiotics significantly improved defecation frequency (SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.70, I2 = 0%) and fecal incontinence (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96, I2 = 0%). However, it did not significantly improve treatment success, painful defecation, and abdominal pain. Probiotics, as add-on therapy, failed to yield a significant difference in treatment success (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.15 to 4.48, I2 = 52%), defecation frequency (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.39, I2 = 0%), defecation consistency (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.38, I2 = 1%), fecal incontinence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.90, I2 = 0%), and abdominal pain (OR, 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.53, I2 = 0%) versus laxatives monotherapy. Synbiotics plus laxatives showed no significant effect on defecation frequency (SMD -0.57; 95% CI -1.29 to 0.14, I2 = 74%) and painful defecation (OR, 3.39; 95% CI 0.74 to 15.55, I2 = 0%) versus laxatives alone. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence did not advocate using probiotics and synbiotics in treating functional constipation in children. At this time, the effects of strain-specific probiotics, probiotics mixtures, and the optimal doses and treatment durations of the probiotics and synbiotics were unclear. Additional rigorous evidence is required to evaluate and establish the effectiveness and safety of probiotics and synbiotics for childhood functional constipation. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020195869.",

METHODS: The literature on probiotics or synbiotics for the treatment of CAD was collected from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The search period was conducted on November 5, 2022, and the search covered all literature before November 5, 2022. The included literature consisted of randomized controlled trials of probiotics or synbiotics for CAD, and a meta-analysis was performed using Stata 14 software and RevMan 5.4 software. RESULTS: The meta-analysis explored the effect of probiotics or synbiotics on the risk factors for coronary artery lesions in a treatment setting with conventional medications for CAD. After a rigorous literature screening process, 10 studies were finally included for data consolidation to objectively evaluate the effect of probiotics or synbiotics on coronary lesions. The results of this study showed that the addition of probiotics or synbiotics to conventional medications for CAD reduced the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [weighted mean difference (WMD) -9.13 (-13.17, -5.09)], fasting glucose (FPG) [WMD -13.60 (-23.57, -3.62)], and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) [standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.60 (-0.83, -0.37)] and increased the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [WMD 1.94 (0.32, 3.57)], nitric oxide (NO) [WMD 5.38 (3.23, 7.54)] but did not affect the triglyceride (TG) level [WMD -13.41 (-28.03, 1.21)], systolic blood pressure (SBP) [WMD -0.88 (-3.72, 1.96)], or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [WMD -0.21 (-2.19, 1.76)]. CONCLUSION: Adding probiotics or synbiotics to conventional medications for CAD may improve patient prognosis.

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is presently considered a multifactorial pathology, which may lead to persistent inflammatory action of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) because of an improperly managed immunological reactivity to the intestinal microbiota found in the GIT. The immune response to common commensal microbes plays an essential role in intestinal inflammation related to UC synbiotics, and it is an important element in the optimal therapy of UC. Therefore, synbiotics, i.e., a mixture of prebiotics and probiotics, may help control the diseased state. Synbiotics alleviate the inflammation of the colon by lowering the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improving the level of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Prebiotic supplementation is not a common practice at the moment, despite numerous research findings proving that the benefits of both probiotics and prebiotics encourage their continued existence and positioning in the GIT, with positive effects on human health by managing the inflammatory response. However, the fact that there have been fewer studies on the treatment of UC with different probiotics coupled with selected prebiotics, i.e., synbiotics, and the outcomes of these studies have been very favorable. This evidence-based study explores the possible role of ROS, SOD, and synbiotics in managing the UC. The proposed review also focuses on the role of alteration of gut microbiota, antioxidant defense in the gastrointestinal tract, and the management of UC. Thus, the current article emphasizes oxidative stress signaling in the GI tract, oxidative stress-based pathomechanisms in UC patients, and UC therapies inhibiting oxidative stress' effects."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a synbiotic product in horses receiving antibiotics. Sixteen actively racing Standardbred horses were randomly allocated (four-way crossover) to one of four groups: antibiotics (10 days; AB), synbiotics (28 days; PROBIOPlusTM; PBP), PBP + AB, or Control. The fecal microbiome was investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing, and fecal dry matter (DM; %), pH, and scores (FS; 0-9) were measured. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA. Results found microbiota differences in community membership between PBP + AB and all other treatments during and after antibiotic treatment. During antibiotic treatment, AB and PBP + AB were significantly different from Control. After antibiotic treatment, PBP + AB was significantly different from all other treatments. The few differences found in relative abundance of phyla or predominant genera were mostly in fiber degrading bacteria. The Fibrobacter population was significantly higher in AB and PBP + AB horses than Control. Unclassified Ruminococcaceae was significantly higher in Control than AB and PBP. After antibiotic treatment, PBP + AB horses were significantly higher than PBP horses. In conclusion, these data provide support for the ability of PROBIOPlus™ to maintain healthy gastrointestinal microbiome during antibiotic treatment."

Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are microbiome-targeted therapies that have been proposed as treatment for NAFLD. We aim to systematically review the effects of these therapies in liver-related outcomes of NAFLD patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in Embase (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), Scopus, Cochrane, and EBSCOhost from inception to August 19, 2022. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that treated NAFLD patients with prebiotics and/or probiotics. We meta-analyzed the outcomes using standardized mean difference (SMD) and assessed study heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool. RESULTS: A total of 41 (18 probiotics, 17 synbiotics, and 6 prebiotics) RCTs were included. Pooled data demonstrated that the intervention had significantly improved liver steatosis (measured by ultrasound grading) (SMD: 4.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.27, 7.25), fibrosis (SMD: -0.61 kPa; 95% CI: -1.12, -0.09 kPa), and liver enzymes including alanine transaminase (SMD: -0.86 U/L; 95% CI: -1.16, -0.56 U/L), aspartate transaminase (SMD: -0.87 U/L; 95% CI: -1.22, -0.52 U/L), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (SMD: -0.77 U/L; 95% CI: -1.26, -0.29 U/L). CONCLUSIONS: Microbiome-targeted therapies were associated with significant improvements in liver-related outcomes in NAFLD patients. Nevertheless, limitations in existing literature like heterogeneity in probiotic strains, dosage, and formulation undermine our findings.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microbiota unbalance has been proven to affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and, noteworthy, microbiota composition and activity are implicated in CKD worsening. The progression of kidney failure implies an exceeding accumulation of waste compounds deriving from the nitrogenous metabolism in the intestinal milieu. Therefore, in the presence of an altered intestinal permeability, gut-derived uremic toxins, i.e., indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), can accumulate in the blood. METHODS: In a scenario facing the nutritional management as adjuvant therapy, the present study assessed the effectiveness of an innovative synbiotics for its ability to modulate the patient gut microbiota and metabolome by setting a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial accounting for IIIb-IV stage CKD patients and healthy controls. Metataxonomic fecal microbiota and fecal volatilome were analyzed at the run-in, after 2 months of treatment, and after 1 month of wash out. RESULTS: Significant changes in microbiota profile, as well as an increase of the saccharolytic metabolism, in feces were found for those CKD patients that were allocated in the synbiotics arm. CONCLUSIONS: Noteworthy, the here analyzed data emphasized a selective efficacy of the present synbiotics on a stage IIIb-IV CKD patients. Nonetheless, a further validation of this trial accounting for an increased patient number should be considered. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT03815786."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the highest incidence of chronic liver disease worldwide, seriously endangering human health, and its pathogenesis is still unclear. In the recent years, increasing evidence has shown that intestinal flora plays an important role in the occurrence and development of NAFLD. Synbiotics can alter gut microbiota and may be a treatment option for NAFLD in the future. OBJECTIVES: To systematically investigate the therapeutic effect of synbiotic supplementation on NAFLD patients. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: We conducted a search on four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were then screened, and data from the included studies were extracted, combined, and analyzed. RESULT: This study analyzed 10 randomized controlled trials involving 634 patients with NAFLD. The results showed that synbiotic supplementation could significantly reduce the level of alanine aminotransferase (mean difference (MD) = -8.80; (95% CI [-13.06, -4.53]), p < 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (MD = -9.48; 95% CI [-12.54, -6.43], p < 0.0001), and γ-glutamyl transferase (MD = -12.55; 95% CI [-19.40, -5.69], p = 0.0003) in NAFLD patients. In the field of metabolism, synbiotic supplementation could significantly reduce the level of total cholesterol (MD = -11.93; 95% CI [-20.43, -3.42], p = 0.006) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = -16.2; 95% CI [-19.79, -12.60], p < 0.0001) and increase the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = 1.56; 95% CI [0.43, 2.68], p = 0.007) in NAFLD patients. In addition, synbiotic supplementation could significantly reduce liver stiffness measurement indicator (MD = -1.09; 95% CI [-1.87, -0.30], p = 0.006) and controlled attenuation parameter indicator (MD = -37.04; 95% CI [-56.78, -17.30], p = 0.0002) in NAFLD patients. CONCLUSION: Based on the current evidence, synbiotic supplementation can improve liver function, adjust lipid metabolism, and reduce the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, but these effects need to be confirmed by further studies."

As prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics show therapeutic potential in the treatment of intestinal dysbiosis, the aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of their supplementation in primary thyroid diseases. REVIEW METHODS: Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL), registers of clinical trials, and grey literature up to 6 October 2022 were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021235054). BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: After screening 1,721 references, two RCTs were identified, which included 136 hypothyroid participants in total. Meta-analysis of the results after eight weeks of supplementation with predominantly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains indicated a clinically and statistically nonsignificant decrease in TSH (MD -0.19 mIU/L; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.06; I2= 0%), and no effect on fT3 levels (MD 0.01 pg/mL; 95% CI-0.16 to 0.18; I2= 0%). Data from single studies indicated no significant change in the levels of fT4, thyroid auto-antibodies, BMI, levothyroxine doses, and severity of symptoms measured with validated scales. Only constipation scores showed significant improvement (MD -8.71 points in the Faecal Incontinence Questionnaire; 95% CI -15.85 to -1.57; I2= 0%). SUMMARY: Low-certainty evidence from two randomised trials, suggests that routine administration of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics may result in little to no benefit in patients with primary hypothyroidism.",

Τhe study aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in patients who undergone abdominal operation, in terms of bowel function post-operatively. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), Embase, US Registry of clinical trials, and sources of grey literature were searched. The relative effect sizes were estimated, and we obtained the relative ranking of the interventions using cumulative ranking curves. RESULTS: In total, 30 studies were included in the analysis. For the outcome of post-operative ileus, probiotics was superior to placebo/no intervention (relative risk, RR: 0.38; 95%CI: 0.14-0.98) with the highest SUCRA (surface under the cumulative ranking) value (92.1%). For time to first flatus, probiotics (MD: -0.47; 95%CI: -0.78 to -0.17) and synbiotics (MD: -0.53; 95%CI: -0.96 to -0.09) were superior to placebo/no intervention. For time to first defecation and for post-operative abdominal distension probiotics were superior to placebo/no intervention. For post-operative hospitalization days, synbiotics were superior to placebo/no intervention (MD: -3.07; 95%CI: -4.80 to -1.34). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of probiotics in patients who had undergone abdominal surgery reduced the prevalence of post-operative ileus, time to first flatus, time to first defecation, and prevalence of post-operative abdominal distension. Synbiotics reduce time to first flatus and post-operative hospitalization days."

      "abstract": "Introduction. Our synbiotics (Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota, Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult, and galacto-oligosaccharides: LBG) helps mitigate serious adverse events such as febrile neutropenia (FN) and diarrhoea in oesophageal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Unfortunately, LBG therapy does not benefit all patients.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Identification of the gut microbiota species involved in adverse events during chemotherapy could help predict the onset of adverse events. Identification of the gut microbiota that influence the efficacy of LBG could also help establish a diagnostic method to identify patients who will respond to LBG before the initiation of therapy.Aim. To identify the gut microbiota involved in adverse events during NAC and that affect the efficacy of LBG therapy.Methodology. This study was ancillary to a parent randomized controlled trial in which 81 oesophageal cancer patients were recruited and administered either prophylactic antibiotics or LBG combined with enteral nutrition (LBG+EN). The study included 73 of 81 patients from whom faecal samples were collected both before and after NAC. The gut microbiota was analysed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and compared based on the degree of NAC-associated adverse events. Furthermore, the association between the counts of identified bacteria and adverse events and the mitigation effect of LBG+EN was also analysed.Results. The abundance of Anaerostipes hadrus and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum in patients with no FN or only mild diarrhoea was significantly higher (P<0.05) compared to those with FN or severe diarrhoea. Moreover, subgroup analyses of patients receiving LBG+EN showed that the faecal A. hadrus count before NAC was significantly associated with a risk of developing FN (OR, 0.11; 95 % CI, 0.01-0.60, P=0.019). The faecal A. hadrus count after NAC was positively correlated with intestinal concentrations of acetic acid (P=0.0007) and butyric acid (P=0.00005).Conclusion. Anaerostipes hadrus and B. pseudocatenulatum may be involved in the ameliorating adverse events and can thus be used to identify beforehand patients that would benefit from LBG+EN during NAC. These results also suggest that LBG+EN would be useful in the development of measures to prevent adverse events during NAC.",

The anti-inflammatory activity of LP-M, LP-P, COS, and the synbiotics was explored using dextran-sodium-sulfate (DSS)-induced acute colitis mice, as well as by comparing the synergistic effects of COS with LP-M or LP-P. The results revealed that L. plantarum, COS, and the synbiotics alleviated the symptoms of mice colitis and inhibited the changes in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) caused by DSS. In addition, the intervention of L. plantarum, COS, and the synbiotics increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria Muribaculaceae and Lactobacillus and suppressed the pathogenic bacteria Turicibacter and Escherichia-Shigella. There was no statistically difference between LP-M and the endogenous synbiotics on intestinal immunity and metabolism. However, the exogenous synbiotics improved SCFAs, inhibited the changes in cytokines and MPO activity, and restored the gut microbiota more effectively than exogenous L. plantarum LP-P. This indicated that the anti-inflammatory activity of exogenous LP-P can be increased by combining it with COS as a synbiotic."

      "abstract": "The use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics has become an important therapy in numerous gastrointestinal diseases in recent years. Modifying the gut microbiota, this therapeutic approach helps to restore a healthy microbiome. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-associated liver disease are among the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. A disrupted intestinal barrier, microbial translocation, and an altered gut microbiome metabolism, or metabolome, are crucial in the pathogenesis of these chronic liver diseases. As pro-, pre-, and synbiotics modulate these targets, they were identified as possible new treatment options for liver disease. In this review, we highlight the current findings on clinical and mechanistic effects of this therapeutic approach in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-associated liver disease.",

      "abstract": "Experimental evidence supports the fact that changes in the bowel microflora due to environmental or dietary factors have been investigated as implicating factors in the etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The amassing knowledge that the inhabited microbiome regulates the gut physiology and immune functions in IBD, has led researchers to explore the effectiveness of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in treating IBD. This therapeutic approach focuses on restoring the dynamic balance between the microflora and host defense mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa to prevent the onset and persistence of intestinal inflammation. Numerous microbial strains and carbohydrate blends, along with their combinations have been examined in experimental colitis models and clinical trials, and the results indicated that it can be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the suppression of inflammation, remission induction, and relapse prevention in IBD with minimal side effects. Several mechanisms of action of probiotics (for e.g., Lactobacillus species, and Bifidobacterium species) have been reported such as suppression of pathogen growth by releasing certain antimicrobial mediators (lactic and hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and bacteriocins), immunomodulation and initiation of an immune response, enhancement of barrier activity, and suppression of human T-cell proliferation. Prebiotics such as lactulose, lactosucrose, oligofructose, and inulin have been found to induce the growth of certain types of host microflora, resulting in an enriched enteric function. These non-digestible food dietary components have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α-related cytokines while augmenting interleukin-10 levels. Although pro-and prebiotics has established their efficacy in healthy subjects, a better understanding of the luminal ecosystem is required to determine which specific bacterial strain or combination of probiotics and prebiotics would prove to be the ideal treatment for IBD. Clinical trials, however, have given some conflicting results, requiring the necessity to cite the more profound clinical effect of these treatments on IBD remission and prevention. The purpose of this review article is to provide the most comprehensive and updated review on the utility of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in the management of active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis/pouchitis.",

      "abstract": "The risk of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is increased by excessive ethanol drinking. For the prevention of ALD, the effects of ethanol on the liver, adipose tissue, and gut are crucial. Interestingly, garlic and a few probiotic strains can protect against ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity. However, the relationship between adipose tissue inflammation, Kyolic aged garlic extract (AGE), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus MTCC1423 in developing ALD is unknown. Therefore, the present study explored the effect of synbiotics (a combination of prebiotics and probiotics) on adipose tissue to prevent ALD. To investigate the efficacy of synbiotics administration on adipose tissue in preventing ALD, in vitro (3T3-L1 cells, N = 3) groups: control, control + LPS (lipopolysaccharide), ethanol, ethanol + LPS, ethanol + synbiotics, ethanol + synbiotics + LPS; in vivo (Wistar male rats, N = 6) groups: control, ethanol, pairfed, ethanol + synbiotics and in silico experiments were conducted. Lactobacillus multiplies in accordance with the growth curve when exposed to AGE. Additionally, Oil red O staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that synbiotics therapy maintained the morphology of adipocytes in the alcoholic model. In support of the morphological changes, quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated overexpression of adiponectin and downregulation of leptin, resistin, PPARγ, CYP2E1, iNOS, IL-6, and TNF-α after administration of synbiotics compared to the ethanol group. In addition, MDA estimation by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that the synbiotics treatment reduced oxidative stress in rat adipose tissue. Consequently, the in-silico analysis revealed that AGE inhibited the C-D-T networks as PPARγ acting as the main target protein. The current study demonstrates that using synbiotics improves adipose tissue metabolism in ALD.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy is still the first line of treatment for most cancer patients. Patients receiving chemotherapy are generally prone to infections, which result in complications, such as sepsis, mucositis, colitis, and diarrhoea. Several nutritional approaches have been trialled to counter the chemotherapy-associated side effects in cancer patients, but none have yet been approved for routine clinical use. One of the approaches to reduce or avoid chemotherapy-associated complications is to restore the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota is essential for the healthy functioning of the immune system, metabolism, and the regulation of other molecular responses in the body. Chemotherapy erodes the mucosal layer of the gastrointestinal tract and results in the loss of gut microbiota. One of the ways to restore the gut microbiota is through the use of probiotics. Probiotics are the 'good' bacteria that may provide health benefits if consumed in appropriate amounts. Some studies have highlighted that the consumption of probiotics in combination with prebiotics, known as synbiotics, may provide better health benefits when compared to probiotics alone. This review discusses the different nutritional approaches that have been studied in an attempt to combat chemotherapy-associated side effects in cancer patients with a particular focus on the use of pre-, pro- and synbiotics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is prevalent with lasting health implications for the mother and offspring. Medical therapy is the foundation of GDM management, for achieving optimal glycemic control often requires treatment with insulin or metformin. Gut dysbiosis is a feature of GDM pregnancies, therefore, dietary manipulation of the gut microbiota may offer a new avenue for management. Probiotics are a relatively new intervention, which can reduce the mother's blood sugar levels and, furthermore, adjust glucose and lipid metabolism in both mother and offspring. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore the effect of probiotics/synbiotics on glucose and lipid metabolism in women with GDM. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the electronic databases Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and EBOSCO, published between 1 January 2012 and 1 November 2022. A total of 11 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were analyzed. The indicators included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting serum insulin (FSI), the homoeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (TG), the mean weight at end of trial, and gestational weight gain (GWG). RESULTS: Compared with the placebo, probiotics/synbiotics were associated with a statistically significant improvement in FPG (MD = -2.33, 95% CI = -4.27, -0.40, p = 0.02), FSI (MD = -2.47 95% CI = -3.82, -1.12, p = 0.0003), HOMA-IR (MD = -0.40, 95% CI = -0.74, -0.06, p = 0.02), and TC (MD = -6.59, 95% CI = -12.23,--0.95, p = 0.02), while other factors had no significant difference. The subgroup analysis revealed that the kind of supplement led to heterogeneity for FPG and FSI, while heterogeneity was not found for others. CONCLUSION: Probiotics/synbiotics could control glucose and lipid metabolism in pregnant women with GDM. There was a significant improvement in FPG, FSI, HOMA-IR, and TC. The use of specific probiotic supplementation may be a promising prevention and therapeutic strategy for GDM. However, due to the heterogeneity among existing studies, further studies are warranted to address the limitations of existing evidence and better inform the management of GDM.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotic therapy through short-term or repeated long-term prescriptions can have several damaging effects on the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract. Changes in microbiota could be multiple including decreased diversity of species in gut microbiota, changed metabolic activity, and the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis in turn can induce antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and recurrent infections caused by Clostridioides difficile. There is also evidence that the use of different chemical classes of antibiotics for the treatment of a variety of ailments can lead to several health issues including gastrointestinal, immunologic, and neurocognitive conditions. This review discusses gut dysbiosis, its symptoms and one important cause, which is antibiotic therapy for the induction of gut dysbiosis. Since the maintenance of good gut health is important for the well-being and functioning of physiological and cognitive activities through the normal gut-microbiota-brain relationship, the condition of dysbiosis is not desirable. Specific therapies are prescribed by medical practitioners for the cure of a variety of ailments, and, if the prescription of antibiotics becomes unavoidable, there is a possibility of the onset of gut dysbiosis as the side or after effects. Therefore, the restoration of imbalanced gut microbiota to its balanced condition becomes necessary. A healthy relationship between gut microbiota and the brain can be achieved with the introduction of probiotic strains into the gut in a practical and consumer-friendly way, such as consumption of food and beverages prepared with the use of characterised probiotic species, fermented foods as the potential biotics, or synbiotic supplements.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence supports the use of dietary interventions and gut microbiota-targeted interventions such as probiotic or prebiotic supplementation for improving mental health. We report on the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effects of a high-prebiotic dietary intervention and probiotic supplements on mental health. METHODS: \"Gut Feelings\" was an 8-week, 2 × 2 factorial RCT of 119 adults with moderate psychological distress and low prebiotic food intake. Treatment arms: (1) probiotic supplement and diet-as-usual (probiotic group); (2) high-prebiotic diet and placebo supplement (prebiotic diet group); (3) probiotic supplement and high-prebiotic diet (synbiotic group); and (4) placebo supplement and diet-as-usual (placebo group). The primary outcome was assessment of total mood disturbance (TMD; Profile of Mood States Short Form) from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, stress, sleep, and wellbeing measures. RESULTS: A modified intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed effects models revealed that the prebiotic diet reduced TMD relative to placebo at 8 weeks [Cohen's d = -0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.18, -0.03; p = 0.039]. There was no evidence of symptom improvement from the probiotic (d = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.75, 0.38; p = 0.51) or synbiotic treatments (d = -0.03, 95% CI = -0.59, 0.53; p = 0.92). Improved anxiety, stress, and sleep were noted in response to the prebiotic diet while the probiotic tentatively improved wellbeing, relative to placebo. No benefit was found in response to the synbiotic intervention. All treatments were well tolerated with few adverse events. CONCLUSION: A high-prebiotic dietary intervention may improve mood, anxiety, stress, and sleep in adults with moderate psychological distress and low prebiotic intake. A synbiotic combination of high-prebiotic diet and probiotic supplement does not appear to have a beneficial effect on mental health outcomes, though further evidence is required. Results are limited by the relatively small sample size. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=372753, identifier ACTRN12617000795392."

However, patients frequently experience treatment-induced gastrointestinal symptoms. Synbiotics, including live microorganisms and nondigestible food ingredients, reportedly ameliorate chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of synbiotics in patients undergoing auto-HSCT. Methods This randomized, double-blinded study included patients with malignant lymphoma eligible for auto-HSCT. The patients were randomly assigned to either a synbiotic group receiving Bifidobacterium longum (BB536) and guar gum or a placebo group receiving a placebo containing dextrin. The supplements were administered twice daily from the start of conditioning chemotherapy up to 28 days after auto-HSCT. The primary endpoint was the duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Results In total, 12 patients were included and randomized. The median duration of TPN was 15 (range, 12-33) days in the synbiotic group and 17.5 (range, 0-32) days in the placebo group. The median duration of grade ≥3 diarrhea was shorter in the synbiotic group than in then placebo group (2.5 vs. 6.5 days), as was the duration of hospital stay (31.5 vs. 43 days). The oral intake and quality of life regarding diarrhea and anorexia improved in the synbiotic group after engraftment. Synbiotic infections, including bacteremia, were not observed. Conclusion Synbiotics may reduce gastrointestinal toxicity, thereby reducing nutritional problems and improving the quality of life of patients undergoing auto-HSCT, without severe adverse events.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of stachyose (ST) and Latilactobacillus sakei Furu 2019 (L. sakei) alone or combined on diphenoxylate-induced constipation and explore the underlying mechanisms using a mouse model. METHODS: ICR mice were randomly divided into five groups. The normal and constipation model groups were intragastrically administrated with PBS. The ST, L. sakei, and synbiotic groups were intragastrically administrated with ST (1.5 g/kg body weight), alive L. sakei (3 × 109 CFU/mouse), or ST + L. sakei (1.5 g/kg plus 3 × 109 CFU/mouse), respectively. After 21 days of intervention, all mice except the normal mice were intragastrically administrated with diphenoxylate (10 mg/kg body weight). Defecation indexes, constipation-related intestinal factors, serum neurotransmitters, hormone levels, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and intestinal microbiota were measured. RESULTS: Our results showed that three interventions with ST, L. sakei, and synbiotic combination (ST + L. sakei) all alleviated constipation, and synbiotic intervention was superior to ST or L. sakei alone in some defecation indicators. The RT-PCR and immunohistochemical experiment showed that all three interventions relieved constipation by affecting aquaporins (AQP4 and AQP8), interstitial cells of Cajal (SCF and c-Kit), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS). The three interventions exhibited a different ability to increase the serum excitatory neurotransmitters and hormones (5-hydroxytryptamine, substance P, motilin), and reduce the serum inhibitory neurotransmitters (vasoactive intestinal peptide, endothelin). The result of 16S rDNA sequencing of feces showed that synbiotic intervention significantly increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia, and regulated the gut microbes of STC mice. In conclusion, oral administration of ST or L. sakei alone or combined are all effective to relieve constipation and the symbiotic use may have a promising preventive effect on STC."

      "abstract": "Probiotics and prebiotics have beneficial effects on host physiology via metabolites from the gut microbiota in addition to their own. Here, we used a pH-controlled single-batch fermenter as a human gut microbiota model. We conducted fecal fermentation with Bifidobacterium breve MCC1274 (probiotic), lactulose (prebiotic), or a combination of both (synbiotic) to evaluate their influence on the gut environment. Fecal inoculum without the probiotic and prebiotic was used as the control. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), based on the composition of gut microbiota, showed a significant difference among the groups. The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was significantly higher in the synbiotic group, compared to that in the other three treatment groups. The relative abundance of Blautia was the highest in the control group among the four groups. CE-TOFMS and LC-TOFMS showed that the number of metabolites detected in the synbiotic group was the highest (352 in total); 29 of the 310 hydrophilic metabolites and 17 of the 107 lipophilic metabolites were significantly different among the four groups in the Kruskal-Wallis test. A clustering based on 46 metabolites indicated that tryptophan-metabolites such as indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-ethanol, and indole-3-carboxaldehyde, were included in a sub cluster composed of metabolites enriched in the synbiotic group. Spermidine, a major polyamine, was enriched in the two groups supplemented with the probiotic whereas spermine was enriched only in the synbiotic group. Not all metabolites enriched in the probiotic and/or synbiotic groups were found in the monocultures of the probiotic strain with or without the prebiotics. This implies that some of the metabolites were produced through the interaction of the fecal microbiota with the inoculated probiotic strain. Co-abundance networking analysis indicated the differences in the correlations between the relative abundance of the fecal microbiota genus and the tryptophan metabolites in each group. There was a strong correlation between ldh4 gene abundance and ILA concentration in the fecal fermentation. The copy number of ldh4 gene was significantly higher in the groups with the probiotic than that in the control group. In conclusion, synbiotics could enhance the production of signaling molecules in the gut environment. Our results provide an insight into more effective administration of probiotics at the molecular level.",
