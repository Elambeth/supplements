      "abstract": "Perioperative anxiety is common in surgical patients and linked to poor outcomes. This multicenter randomized controlled trial assessed the effect of the use of a warm weighted blanket on presurgical anxiety and pain, as well as postsurgical restlessness, nausea, and vomiting. Levels of anxiety and pain were measured in adult patients using a 100-point visual analog scale before elective surgery. Patients received either a warm weighted blanket (n = 74) or a traditional sheet or nonweighted blanket (n = 74). Patients in the intervention group had significantly lower preoperative anxiety scores (mean [SD] = 26.28 [25.75]) compared to the control group (mean [SD] = 38.73 [30.55], P = .008). However, the intervention had no significant effect on presurgical pain or postsurgical nausea, vomiting, or restlessness. These results suggest that weighted blankets reduce preoperative anxiety in adult patients.",

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine differences in sample characteristics and longitudinal sleep outcomes according to weighted blanket (WB) adherence. METHODS: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 94), mean age 9.0 (standard deviation 2.2, range 6-14) participated in a 16-week sleep intervention with WBs. Children were classified as WB adherent (use of WB ≥ 4 nights/wk) or nonadherent (use of WB ≤ 3 nights/wk). Changes in objectively measured sleep by actigraphy, parent-reported sleep problems (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) and child-reported Insomnia Severity Index were evaluated according to adherence with mixed effect models. Sex, age, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder subtype were examined as potential moderators. RESULTS: Children adherent to WBs (48/94) showed an early response in sleep outcomes and an acceptance of the WB after 4 weeks of use as well as a decrease in parent-reported (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) (-5.73, P = .000) and child-reported (Insomnia Severity Index) (-4.29, P = .005) sleep problems after 16 weeks. The improvement in sleep was larger among WB adherent vs nonadherent (between-group difference: Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire: -2.09, P = .038; Insomnia Severity Index: -2.58, P = .007). Total sleep time was stable for children adherent to WB but decreased for nonadherent (between-group difference: +16.90, P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: An early response in sleep and acceptance of the WB predicted later adherence to WBs. Improvements in sleep were more likely among WB adherents vs nonadherents. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may thus benefit from using WBs to handle their sleep problems. CITATION: Lönn M, Svedberg P, Nygren J, Jarbin H, Aili K, Larsson I.

METHODS: For this study, a four-week, single-case, multiple-participant ABA study design was used. Through convenience sampling, four participants scoring 15 or greater on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which categorizes them as having moderate to severe insomnia, and much more than most people in sensory sensitivity on the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile were recruited. First, seven-day baseline sleep data was gathered, followed by two weeks of weighted blanket use, concluding with a seven-day withdrawal phase. Additional outcome measures included: Tuck and Snooze Survey, Consensus Sleep Diary Morning, and Additional Sleep Diary Questions. Data analysis included visual analysis, mean comparisons, Tau-U calculations, and pre- to post-ISI category comparisons. RESULTS: All participants' ISI scores were categorized as one level less severe postintervention. All participants demonstrated increased sleep quality, and three participants showed an increase in sleep duration based on individual mean comparisons between baseline and intervention phases. CONCLUSION: Weighted blankets appear beneficial in reducing insomnia severity in adults with much more than the average population sensory sensitivity. In addition, those with self-reported anxiety may have increased benefit from this intervention.",

Polysomnography revealed frequent non-arousing periodic limb movements and a high PLMD index. The patient was advised on non-pharmacological interventions, including the use of weighted blankets, sleep hygiene education, and lifestyle modifications. At the six-week follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in symptoms. The case report highlights the potential effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in managing PLMD and emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. Further research is required to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of these interventions. The psychological impact of PLMD on the patient's social life and academic performance is also discussed. The management of sleep disorders should involve a multidisciplinary approach to improve patient outcomes and quality of life."

      "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to examine protective stabilization (PS) patterns before and after the availability of weighted blankets (WBs) as a behavioral guidance approach during in-office dental moderate sedation. Methods: A retrospective chart review evaluated pediatric patient sedation records after six-pound lead-free WBs were introduced into the dental clinic and compared clinical outcomes to a time before WBs were available. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed variables associated with the occurrence of PS use during a sedation visit. Results: PS (PS) usage decreased from 78.7 percent before to 32.8 percent after the availability of WBs during sedation visits (chi-square, P<0.001). Increase in age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] equals 0.69, 95 percent confidence interval [95% CI] equals 0.53 to 0.90, P=0.006) and WB use reduced PS management (adjusted OR equals 0.067, 95% CI equals 0.020 to 0.22, P<0.001). Body mass index, gender, treatment amount, and sedation regimen did not predict the occurrence of PS. The number of completed teeth treated was not found to be statistically different between cases managed with PS versus those managed without restraint. Children managed with PS but without WBs had statistically higher heart rate changes (20.26±23.17) during treatment than children managed without restraint (8.12±15.15). Conclusions: An increase in age and weighted blanket use was associated with a reduction in the occurrence of protective stabilization during moderate sedation dental visits at the university pediatric dental clinic. Clinical practice sedation protocols should consider weighted blanket use as an alternative to PS.",

      "abstract": "Weighted blankets have emerged as a potential non-pharmacological intervention to ease conditions such as insomnia and anxiety. Despite a lack of experimental evidence, these alleged effects are frequently attributed to a reduced activity of the endogenous stress systems and an increased release of hormones such as oxytocin and melatonin. Thus, the aim of the present in-laboratory crossover study (26 young and healthy participants, including 15 men and 11 women) was to investigate if using a weighted blanket (~12% of body weight) at bedtime resulted in higher salivary concentrations of melatonin and oxytocin compared with a light blanket (~2.4% of body weight). We also examined possible differences in salivary concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase activity (as an indicative metric of sympathetic nervous system activity), subjective sleepiness, and sleep duration. When using a weighted blanket, the 1 hour increase of salivary melatonin from baseline (i.e., 22:00) to lights off (i.e., 23:00) was about 32% higher (p = 0.011). No other significant differences were found between the blanket conditions, including subjective sleepiness and total sleep duration. Our study is the first to suggest that using a weighted blanket may result in a more significant release of melatonin at bedtime. Future studies should investigate whether the stimulatory effect on melatonin secretion is observed on a nightly basis when frequently using a weighted blanket over weeks to months. It remains to be determined whether the observed increase in melatonin may be therapeutically relevant for the previously described effects of the weighted blanket on insomnia and anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Pleasant sensation is an underexplored avenue for modulation of chronic pain. Deeper pressure is perceived as pleasant and calming, and can improve sleep. Although pressure can reduce acute pain, its effect on chronic pain is poorly characterized. The current remote, double-blind, randomized controlled trial tested the hypothesis that wearing a heavy weighted blanket - providing widespread pressure to the body - relative to a light weighted blanket would reduce ratings of chronic pain, mediated by improvements in anxiety and sleep. Ninety-four adults with chronic pain were randomized to wear a 15-lb. (heavy) or 5-lb. (light) weighted blanket during a brief trial and overnight for one week. Measures of anxiety and chronic pain were collected pre- and post-intervention, and ratings of pain intensity, anxiety, and sleep were collected daily. After controlling for expectations and trait anxiety, the heavy weighted blanket produced significantly greater reductions in broad perceptions of chronic pain than the light weighted blanket (Cohen's f = .19, CI [-1.97, -.91]). This effect was stronger in individuals with high trait anxiety (P = .02). However, weighted blankets did not alter pain intensity ratings. Pain reductions were not mediated by anxiety or sleep. Given that the heavy weighted blanket was associated with greater modulation of affective versus sensory aspects of chronic pain, we propose that the observed reductions are due to interoceptive and social/affective effects of deeper pressure. Overall, we demonstrate that widespread pressure from a weighted blanket can reduce the severity of chronic pain, offering an accessible, home-based tool for chronic pain. The study purpose, targeted condition, study design, and primary and secondary outcomes were pre-registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04447885: \"Weighted Blankets and Chronic Pain\"). PERSPECTIVE: This randomized-controlled trial showed that a 15-lb weighted blanket produced significantly greater reductions in broad perceptions of chronic pain relative to a 5-lb weighted blanket, particularly in highly anxious individuals. These findings are relevant to patients and providers seeking home-based, nondrug therapies for chronic pain relief.",

The use of sensory interventions such as the weighted blanket (WB) is garnering interest as alternatives to aid in managing anxiety, anger, and aggressive behaviors. Reports of the effectiveness of the WB have primarily been anecdotal, and results of research with children have been mixed. Only one study has been conducted with the WB with adults on an inpatient psychiatric unit. AIMS: The aim of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness of the WB by determining whether it decreases anxiety and/or anger in adult emergency department patients with preexisting psychiatric diagnoses. METHODS: The study used a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group design with pre- and posttests for anxiety and anger. The intervention was a 15-pound WB. Participants (N = 15) were in one of three groups, which included no weighted blanket (NWB), WB for 15 minutes, or WB for 30 minutes. RESULTS: All three groups showed a decrease in anxiety and anger scores. However, participants in the WB groups had a greater decrease in anxiety and anger posttest scores. CONCLUSIONS: The small sample size in this study did not allow for the determination of any differences between groups on anxiety or anger scores that could be viewed as a significant finding.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To measure rate of subscription of common sleep medication and diagnoses of substance use disorder (SUD) before and after receiving a prescribed weighted blanket (WB) among patients with psychiatric diagnoses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using register-based data of health-related factors in a Swedish region, a total of 1785 adult individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis, received a WB and resided in the region during the study period were identified. Using each individual as their own control, the rate of one-year prior prescription of WB or diagnosed SUD was compared to rate after a half year wash-out after prescription of WB for a full year. RESULTS: The number of patients without prescription of sleep medication increased by 3.3% (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.2-6.4, p=.04). Furthermore, the proportion without a prescription of benzodiazepine receptor agonist/antihistamines sleep medication increased by 5.5% (95%CI: 2.2-8.8, p=.001). Melatonin prescription increased after WB by 3.6% (95%CI: 1.1-6.2, p=.006). Younger age and unipolar-, anxiety-, attention-deficit/hyperactivity-, and post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with decreased use while psychotic-/bipolar- and personality disorder was not associated with a decrease in the use of sleep medication. The number of alcohol SUD diagnoses did not increase while sedative SUD rate increased statistically significantly by 0.7% (odds ratio = 1.63, p=.02). In a multivariate model, only younger age predicted discontinuation of sleep medication while psychotic-/bipolar- and personality disorder had statistically less decrease. CONCLUSION: This observational register study found a statistically significant association between WB use and decreased use of common sleep medication except melatonin that increased slightly.",

However, the research related to the use and effectiveness of weighted blankets is sparse. OBJECTIVE: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize the current literature to help develop the impetus needed to launch a research study into the effectiveness of using weighted blankets to decrease anxiety and insomnia. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted between January 23, 2018, and March 1, 2018. Databases and sites included the Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, OTseeker, Web of Science, and Nursing Reference Center Plus. Search terms included weighted blanket, deep pressure, and occupational therapy as well as combinations of these terms. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA COLLECTION: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles were included if the study used weighted blankets as the modality of deep pressure stimulation. Data from presentations, conference proceedings, non-peer-reviewed literature, dissertations, and theses were excluded. FINDINGS: Only 8 studies were included: 4 Level I, 2 Level III, and 2 Level IV studies. The outcomes of these studies suggest that weighted blankets have the potential to be beneficial in limited settings and populations. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Weighted blankets may be an appropriate therapeutic tool in reducing anxiety; however, there is not enough evidence to suggest they are helpful with insomnia. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: Evidence-based research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets in reducing anxiety and insomnia is sparse. More research is needed to define guidelines for the use of weighted blankets in clinical practice and to investigate the underlying mechanism of action. This systematic review can be used to begin an investigation of the use of weighted blankets for larger and more diverse populations.",
