      "abstract": "The discovery of effective cysteine protease inhibitors with crude protein kiwi extracts (CPKEs) has created novel challenges and prospects for pharmaceutical development. Despite extensive research on CPKEs, limited research has been conducted on treating atopic dermatitis (AD). Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of CPKEs on TNF-α activation in a HaCaT cell model and in a DNCB (1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene)-induced atopic dermatitis animal model. The molecular weight of the CPKE was determined using SDS-PAGE under non-reducing (17 kDa and 22 kDa) and reducing conditions (25 kDa, 22 kDa, and 15 kDa), whereas gelatin zymography was performed to examine the CPKE's inhibitory impact on cysteine protease (actinidin and papain) activity. Moreover, the CPKE remains stable at 60 °C, with pH levels varying from 4 to 11, as determined by the azocasein assay. CPKE treatment decreased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt, along with the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-p65 in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-stimulated HaCaT cells. Five-week-old BALB/c mice were treated with DNCB to act as an AD-like animal model. The topical application of CPKE to DNCB-treated mice for three weeks substantially decreased clinical dermatitis severity and epidermal thickness and reduced eosinophil infiltration and mast cells into ear and skin tissues. These findings imply that CPKE derived from kiwifruit might be a promising therapy option for inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.",

      "abstract": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) play a crucial role in bone formation through their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts. Aging, however, detrimentally affects the differentiation and proliferation capacities of BM-MSCs, consequently impairing bone regeneration. Thus, mitigating the aging effects on BM-MSCs is vital for addressing bone-related pathologies. In this study, we demonstrate that extracellular nanovesicles isolated from gold kiwi (GK-NVs) protect human BM-MSCs from ultraviolet (UV)-induced photoaging, thereby alleviating aging-related impairments in cellular functions that are crucial for bone homeostasis. Notably, GK-NVs were efficiently taken up by BM-MSCs without causing cytotoxicity. GK-NVs reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels upon UV irradiation, restoring impaired proliferation and migration capabilities. Furthermore, GK-NVs corrected the skewed differentiation capacities of UV-irradiated BM-MSCs by enhancing osteoblast differentiation, as evidenced by the increased expression in osteoblast-specific genes and the calcium deposition, and by reducing adipocyte differentiation, as indicated by the decreased lipid droplet formation. These findings position GK-NVs as a promising biomaterial for the treatment of bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Dental bleaching, a common cosmetic treatment, typically uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Yet, the search for natural options has prompted an investigation into fruit extract efficacies such as papain, bromelain, and actinidin for tooth whitening. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 30% hydrogen peroxide and fruit extracts (papaya, pineapple, and kiwi) on human enamel using a spectrophotometer at different time intervals. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty maxillary anterior teeth were stained with tea solution and evaluated for baseline color. They were then divided into four groups: hydrogen peroxide alone and hydrogen peroxide combined with papaya, pineapple, or kiwi extracts. Each group was further divided based on bleaching duration: 10 or 20 min. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The color value of the bleached teeth was measured using a reflectance spectrophotometer. In order to analyze the data, one-way ANOVA, post hoc Tukey, and paired t-tests were used. The significance level was established at α =0.05. RESULTS: Combining hydrogen peroxide with pineapple extract showed the highest efficacy, followed by papaya and kiwi extracts. Hydrogen peroxide alone also demonstrated significant bleaching efficacy, albeit lower than the combinations with fruit extracts. CONCLUSION: Combining hydrogen peroxide with pineapple and papaya extracts notably improves dental bleaching efficacy, as shown by reduced color difference (ΔE) values. This underscores the potential of natural enzymes in tooth whitening."

The juice was treated in the presence of kiwi juice (0-8%), and its physicochemical properties and microbial load were compared with raw juice. The study also highlighted the key enzymes causing sugarcane juice discoloration, peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), by quantifying kiwi juice constituents using GC-MS and monitoring their effects by molecular docking. Kiwi addition considerably raised (p < 0.05) acidity, ascorbic acid (54.28%), and phenolic compounds (32%), and decreased the POD and PPO activity of raw cane juice. Pasteurization in the presence of kiwi, rather than microwave treatment, has significantly (p < 0.05) increased the phenolic compounds and reduced POD and PPO activities until barley was detected. Molecular docking revealed that heptacosane, oleic acid, and melezitose are the primary kiwi components responsible for enzyme inactivation.",

      "abstract": "This study explores the potential of thermosonication as an alternative to traditional heat treatments, such as pasteurization, in the processing of fruit juices. Conventional methods often lead to undesirable quality changes in fruit juices, whereas thermosonication offers promising results regarding microbial inactivation and quality preservation. This work focused on the inactivation kinetics of Listeria innocua 2030c, a surrogate for pathogenic L. monocytogenes, in kiwifruit juice using thermosonication at 45 °C, 50 °C, and 55 °C. These treatments were compared with equivalent heat treatments. Quality attributes of the juice were also evaluated to assess process efficiency. Survival data of L. innocua were fitted with the Weibull model, estimating first decimal reduction times (δ) and shape parameters (n). The results reveal temperature and process dependencies on δ, while n remains mostly temperature and treatment independent. Thermosonication outperforms heat treatment, achieving higher L. innocua reductions while retaining quality attributes like pH, soluble solid content, and total phenolics and chlorophylls. Thermosonication at 55 °C stands out, providing a 6.2-log-cycle reduction in just 3 min with superior quality retention. These findings highlight the synergistic effect of temperature and ultrasound, making mild heat processes feasible while enhancing product quality. Thermosonication, particularly at 55 °C, emerges as an effective alternative to traditional thermal treatments for fruit juices, offering improved microbial safety without compromising product quality."

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of kiwi root in the treatment of NSCLC through network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. METHODS: The active components and targets of kiwi root were obtained from the TCMSP database, and NSCLC-related targets were obtained from the GeneCards, OMIM, and DrugBank databases. The intersection targets of NSCLC and kiwi root were obtained from VENNY 2.1.0. Then, the common targets were imported into the STRING database, and by using the Cytoscape 3.7.1 software, drug-disease network diagrams were created. Afterwards, the DAVID database was utilized to perform bioinformatic annotation. Finally, molecular docking of key components and key targets was performed by Autodock Tools. RESULTS: A total of 4083 NSCLC-related disease genes were collected from the GeneCards, OMIM,and DrugBank databases, and 177 non-duplicated drug targets were acquired from the TCMSP database. A total of 138 intersection target genes were obtained, in which TP53, AKT1, and TNF were the key targets. CONCLUSION: Through network pharmacology techniques, the mechanism of kiwi root in the treatment of NSCLC has been uncovered and provides a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of NSCLC with kiwi root, which requires further experimental validation.",

      "abstract": "Sorafenib is an oral treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, poor water solubility, harsh gastrointestinal environment and off-target effects contribute to the low bioavailability of oral sorafenib. Plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) are biological nanovesicles with various bioactive functions that offer significant advantages in the field of oral drug delivery: protection from degradation by gastrointestinal fluids; crossing the intestinal epithelial barrier; specific targeting; safety; and abundant yield. However, there are fewer studies applying PDEVs for anti-tumor drug delivery to extra-digestive tissues. In this study, kiwifruit-derived extracellular vesicles (KEVs) were isolated and purified from kiwifruit, and their natural hepatic accumulation properties were exploited for targeted delivery of sorafenib (KEVs-SFB). Evidence showed that encapsulation of KEVs reduced the leakage of sorafenib in the gastrointestinal environment and enhanced the ability to cross the intestinal epithelium; KEVs-SFB was able to achieve liver accumulation and was predominantly taken up by HepG2 cells; KEVs-SFB was effective in inhibiting 4T1 cell proliferation; in the orthotopic liver cancer model, oral administration of KEVs-SFB inhibited tumor growth and improved the side effects of SFB. This PDEVs-based oral drug delivery platform is important for improving oral bioavailability and reducing drug side effects.",

Methods 96 male healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into normal control group, model group, and kiwi fruit essence treatment group(60 and 240 mg/kg) by the random number table method, with 24 animals in each group. The whole lungs underwent 6 MV X-ray irradiation (18 Gy) to induce RILI animal models in rats of the latter three groups. On the next day after irradiation, rats in the latter two groups were intragastrically administrated with 60 or 240 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence, once a day. The rats in the normal control and model groups were treated with 9 g/L sodium chloride solution. Eight rats in the latter three groups were randomly sacrificed on days 14, 28, and 56, while normal control rats were sacrificed on day 56 as the overall control. Blood samples were collected and separated. Serum concentrations of TNF-α and PDGF-B were detected using ELISA. The lung tissues were isolated for HE and Masson staining to evaluate alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). The hydroxyproline (HYP) content in lung tissues was detected. The mRNA and protein expression of pulmonary TNF-α and PDGF-B were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Results Compared with the model group, treatment with 60 and 240 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence group significantly reduced alveolitis on days 14 and 28 as well as PF lesions on days 28 and 56. Compared with the normal control group, HYP content in the lung tissue of the model group increased on day 28 and day 56, while TNF-α and PDGF-B levels in the serum and lung tissues increased at each time point. Compared with the model group during the same period, 60 and 240 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence element treatment group reported the diminished levels of serum and pulmonary TNF-α on day 14 and day 28. Consistently, the lung tissue HYP content and serum and pulmonary PDGF-B levels on day 28 and day 56 were reduced. In addition, the above indicators in the 240 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence treatment group were lower than those for the 60 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence treatment group. Conclusion Kiwi fruit essence can alleviate RILI in rats, which is related to the down-regulation of TNF-α expression at the early stage and decreased PDGF-B level at the middle and late stages.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) has rich nutritious and medicinal properties. It is widely consumed worldwide for the intervention of metabolism disorders, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Acrylamide, a well-known toxic ingredient, mainly forms in high-temperature processed carbohydrate-rich food and causes disorders of gut microbiota and systemic metabolism. METHODS: This study explored the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of kiwifruit polysaccharides against acrylamide-induced disorders of gut microbiota and systemic metabolism by measuring the changes of gut microbiota and serum metabolites in mice. RESULTS: The results showed that kiwifruit polysaccharides remarkably alleviated acrylamide-induced toxicity in mice by improving their body features, histopathologic morphology of the liver, and decreased activities of liver function enzymes. Furthermore, the treatment restored the healthy gut microbiota of mice by improving the microbial diversity and abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus. Metabolomics analysis revealed the positive effects of kiwifruit polysaccharides mainly occurred through amino and bile acid-related metabolism pathways including nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. Additionally, correlation analysis indicated that Lactobacillus exhibited a highly significant correlation with critical metabolites of bile acid metabolism. DISCUSSION: Concisely, kiwifruit polysaccharides may protect against acrylamide-induced toxicity by regulating gut microbiota and metabolism."

If they are properly decontaminated, they can be used as healthy food ingredients reducing food waste. The objective was to apply thermosonication processes to kiwi peel and evaluate the impact on Listeria innocua survival (a non-pathogenic surrogate of L. monocytogenes) and key nutrients and quality indicators: proteins, fibers, minerals (Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P), chlorophylls, and phenolic contents. Kiwi peels were artificially inoculated with L. innocua and thermal and thermosonication treatments were performed at 55 °C and 60 °C for 30 and 15 min maximum, respectively. Bacteria were enumerated through treatment time, and quality indicators were assessed before and at the end of treatments. A Weibull model with a decimal reduction time (D-value) was successfully used in L. innocua survival data fits. Results showed that coupling temperature to ultrasound had a synergistic effect on bacteria inactivation with significant decreases in D-values. Thermosonication at 60 °C was the most effective in terms of protein, fiber, chlorophylls, and phenolics retention. Minerals were not significantly affected by all treatments. Applying thermosonication to kiwi peel was more effective for decontamination than thermal treatments at the same temperature while allowing the retention of healthy compounds."

Nanoparticle based small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy representing another promising alternative by silencing specific gene while still suffered from charge associated toxicity, strong immunogenicity and poor targetability. Herein, we reported a novel EGFR-mutant NSCLC therapy relying on edible and cation-free kiwi-derived extracellular vesicles (KEVs), which showed sevenfold enhancement of safe dosage compared with widely used cationic liposomes and could be further loaded with Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 interfering RNA (siSTAT3). siSTAT3 loaded KEVs (STAT3/KEVs) could be easily endowed with EGFR targeting ability (STAT3/EKEVs) and fluorescence by surface modification with tailor-making aptamer through hydrophobic interaction. STAT3/EKEVs with a controlled size of 186 nm displayed excellent stability, high specificity and good cytotoxicity towards EGFR over-expressing and mutant PC9-GR4-AZD1 cells. Intriguingly, the systemic administration of STAT3/EKEVs significantly suppressed subcutaneous PC9-GR4-AZD1 tumor xenografts in nude mice by STAT3 mediated apoptosis. This safe and robust KEVs has emerged as the next generation of gene delivery platform for NSCLC therapy after multiple drug-resistance.",

      "abstract": "Spent broiler hen meat is sold at a lower price, owing to its poor texture and lower acceptability, in comparison with broiler meat. The tenderization of spent hen meat using kiwi and pineapple extracts will encourage meat processors to use this less expensive meat as a new source of raw materials for the production of different chicken meat-derived products, particularly when solving the problem associated with a great shortage of raw chicken meat materials. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of kiwi extracts (5 and 7%), pineapple extracts (5 and 7%), and a combination between the two (5% kiwi and 5% pineapple) on the structural changes, electrophoretic pattern, and quality attributes of spent hen meat patties. The results demonstrated that all extract-treated meat patties exhibited a significant decrease in collagen content and shear force value, a significant increase in collagen solubility percentage, and significant improvements to all sensory attributes, in contrast to their counterpart control samples. Additionally, a non-significant change in lightness and yellowness values and a significant increase in redness value were observed in all extract-treated specimens. Moreover, the treatment of spent hen meat patties with kiwi and pineapple extracts resulted in marked degenerative changes of the muscle fiber and connective tissue, as well as a decrease in protein bands, with subsequent enhancement in tenderness. The effect was more highlighted in specimens treated with pineapple extracts (7%) and with kiwi (5%) and pineapple extracts mixture (5%)."

      "abstract": "New Zealand's iconic bird species, the kiwi, is facing significant threats from dogs. Dogs walked off leash or left outside frequently kill fragile kiwi, posing a major social issue. Local governments have spread awareness through billboards, pamphlets, and other media, but there are no empirical analyses of message effectiveness or targeting. There is a dearth of research on behavioural interventions in conservation, where pro-environmental behaviour is typically costly to individuals. This study uses a randomised control trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of four different messages on a local policy for dog registration, using thousands of households. The RCT aims to increase dog registration fees, which, although compulsory, have low compliance in some areas. Results suggest considerable heterogeneity in response across messages, with only messages focussed on kiwi conservation and dog attacks having an impact on registration, and only in some groups. A social norm /\"nudge\"-based message had no effect. Results should help design future messaging programs, as well as raise funds for conservation through additional registration fees. This study is one of the first to use an evidence-based approach for conservation messages in a critical area and provides several implications for future policy and engagement campaigns."

In this study, reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress indices, real-time PCR, Western blotting, confocal microscopy, and molecular docking were used to investigate the protective effect of purified kiwi leaves PAs (PKLPs) on Caco-2 cells’ oxidative stress mechanisms. The results confirmed that pre-treatment with PKLPs significantly reduced H2O2-induced oxidative damage, accompanied by declining ROS levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation in the Caco-2 cells. The PKLPs upregulated the expression of antioxidative enzymes (GSH-px, CAT, T-SOD) and the relative mRNA (Nrf, HO-1, SOD-1, CAT) of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) signaling pathway. The protein-expressing level of the Nrf2 and its relative protein (NQO-1, HO-1, SOD-1) were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the PKLPs pre-treatment group compared to the model group. In conclusion, the novelty of this study is that it explains how PKLPs’ efficacy on the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway, in protecting vital cells from oxidative stress, could be used for cleaner production."

In this study, KS was modified by high-power ultrasound treatment (HUT) to reveal the relationship between the structure and function of KS with different treatment powers (0, 200, 400, and 600 W) and different treatment times (0, 10, 20, and 30 min). The results showed that HUT destroyed the granular morphology of KS, formed holes and cracks on the surface, and reduced the particle size and the short-range molecular order of KS. After different HUTs, the apparent amylose content (AAC), swelling power (SP), water solubility index (WSI), viscosity and setback value (SB) of KS were significantly increased, while the gelatinization temperature was significantly decreased. In addition, HUT significantly reduced the content of rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS), while it significantly enhanced the content of resistant starch (RS) (64.08-72.73%). In a word, HUT as a novel physical modification method for KS, enlarged its application, and fulfilled different demands of a starch-based product, which introduces another possibility for kiwi fruit further processing.",

The bird appeared clinically normal upon arrival, but within 30 days, it developed clinical disease signs of sneezing, stridor, and increased respiratory effort. Upon examination a 1-mm yellow plaque was identified on the glottis. After 14 days of empiric treatment with enrofloxacin, meloxicam, and itraconazole, on repeat examination, the glottal plaque had increased in size to a 7-mm-diameter friable mass attached to the right laryngeal cartilage and was partially obstructing the airway. Initially, 80% of the mass was manually dislodged, but within 4 days the tissue mass had again enlarged to approximately 3 mm × 4 mm × 4 mm, prompting surgical excision. On histopathologic examination, the mass was identified as a benign salivary gland adenoma without clear margins. Approximately 3 years postexcision, there is no evidence of tumor regrowth. The successful excision of a benign salivary tumor described in this report will serve as a valuable guide for future cases of similar neoplasms diagnosed in the oral cavity of kiwis and other avian species.",

Kiwi fruit slices without any treatment were designated as the control. Compared to the control, all coated samples retained higher ascorbic acid, titratable acidity, total phenolic component and antioxidant capacity levels. However, xanthan-gum-coated slices retained significantly higher amounts of total phenolics in comparison to alginate- and chitosan-coated slices (p ≤ 0.05). HPLC analysis showed the presence of neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid and epicatechin. The results suggest that the xanthan gum can be utilized to enhance the shelf life of fresh-cut kiwi slices without compromising quality."

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the potential of US treatment on PAs extracted from kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) leaves, and to provide a comprehensive chemical composition and bioactivity relationship of the purified kiwifruit leaves PAs (PKLPs). Several methods like single-factor experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) for the four affected factors on US extraction efficiency were constructed. HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, cytotoxicity analysis, and antioxidant activity were also demonstrated. In the results, the modeling of PA affected factors showed that 40% US-amplitude, 30 mL/g dry weight (DW) solvent to solid ration (S/S), and 70 °C for 15 min were the optimum conditions for the extraction of PAs. Furthermore, PKLPs exhibited significant radical scavenging and cellular antioxidant activity (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study's novelty comes from the broad prospects of using US in PKLP green extraction that could play an important role in maximizing this phytochemical functionality in drug discovery and food science fields."

Methods 32 C57BL/6J mice bearing Lewis lung adenocarcinoma cells were randomly divided into the control group, 60, 120 and 240 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence treatment groups. Each group included 8 animals. From the fourth day after innoculation, the mice in the control group were intragastrically treated with normal saline, and the mice were intragastrically treated with 60, 120 or 240 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence in the corresponding kiwi fruit essence treatment groups. After measuring the volume of transplanted tumors, all mice were sacrificed on day 24, and their pulmonary tissues were then removed to observe tumor metastasis. The transplanted tumors were exfoliated and weighed to calculate the metastasis inhibition rate and tumor inhibition rate. The protein expression level of EHD2 in the transplanted tumors was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The mRNA expression level of EHD2 in the transplanted tumors was measured using real-time quantitative PCR. Results Compared with the control group, the growth, volume, quality and number of lung metastasis nodules of the subcutaneous transplanted tumors significantly decreased, and tumor inhibition rates and metastasis inhibition rates increased in 60, 120, 240 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence treatment groups. The protein and mRNA level of EHD2 in the subcutaneous transplanted tumors went up. Compared with the 60 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence treatment group, the above indicators were significantly improved in 120 and 240 mg/kg kiwi fruit essence treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion Kiwi fruit essence can up-regulate EHD2 expression, thereby inhibiting the growth and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma transplantation tumor in mice.",

The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration (25 and 100 mg/mL, respectively) against L. monocytogenes were observed for SLE and GLE, respectively. GKE had the lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical scavenging activity (5.06 mg/mL). The pH values of meat inoculated with L. monocytogenes and dipped in 1% SLE (LSLE), 1% GLE (LGLE), or 1% GKE (LGKE) were lower than that of the control on day 3 of storage (p<0.05). The initial population of L. monocytogenes in meat was 4.95-5.01 Log CFU/g. However, the population in the LSLE (5.73 Log CFU/g) was lower than that in the control (6.23 Log CFU/g) on day 5 (p<0.05). The volatile basic nitrogen value of the LSLE (19.90 mg/100 g) was lower than that of the control (24.38 mg/100 g) on day 7 (p<0.05). Moreover, treatment with SLE resulted in the maintenance of meat quality and reduced the population of L. monocytogenes on the meat. Thus, SLE may be used as an alternative natural and environmentally friendly sanitizer for reducing L. monocytogenes contamination in the chicken meat industry."

Thus, identification of strategies to overcome insensitivity to apoptosis and growth inhibition is a growing focus of research in this malignancy. This study evaluated the potential anti-cancer effects of an ethanol extract from the Actinidia arguta (Hardy Kiwi) root (RAE) on CCA. Our data demonstrated that RAE decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis by activation of Caspase 3, Caspase 8, and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in two CCA cell lines. RAE induced a decrease in Mcl-1 in cultured CCA cells and in xenograft CCA tumors. Administration of RAE every other day led to significant growth inhibition in tumor burden xenograft CCA mice. Western blotting analysis of paired human CCA and normal adjacent tissues from the same patient revealed that CCA tissues exhibited significantly higher Mcl-1 expression than normal tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the anti-cancer effects of RAE on CCA both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that RAE may be a promising anti-CCA agent and could be beneficial in the treatment of CCA through the targeting of Mcl-1.",

Methods: Aroma profiles were characterized using solid-phase microextraction GC-MS method. Principal component analysis was used to separate and group the wines as well as for identifying the aroma components that best differentiate the wines. Results: Esters and alcohols were the two most abundant compounds in kiwi wine. Skin maceration treatment gave rise to a positive effect of aroma profiles, resulting in a significant increase of terpenes. A total of 11 volatile compounds were found at concentrations higher than their odor threshold in kiwi wine samples. Conclusions: The study could play a role in laying a foundation for the development of the kiwi fruit wine industry.

      "abstract": "AIM: To assess the efficacy of toltrazuril against the Eimeria spp. affecting brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). METHODS: Droppings were collected from three brown kiwi, aged <6 months old, at a captive rearing facility in the North Island of New Zealand, between 22 February and 20 April 2017, on 14 sampling dates. Only droppings (n=30) that were excreted between 03:00 and 07:00, as determined using video surveillance, were included for analysis, reflecting the peak time for shedding of coccidial oocysts for brown kiwi. Oocysts were quantified in each sample and Eimeria species identified on the basis of oocyst morphology. All samples were collected between 2 and 10 days after the birds had been treated with 25 mg/kg toltrazuril. RESULTS: Eimeria spp. oocysts were identified in 28/30 individual samples and on 14/14 sampling dates. Oocyst counts varied from 0 to 328,080 oocysts per gram (opg), and at least one oocyst count >10,000 opg was measured on 12/14 sampling dates. Three species of Eimeria were observed, with Eimeria apteryxii and E. kiwii most commonly encountered, whereas only one sample contained E. paraurii. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the three birds monitored at this research site, there was a high abundance of E. apteryxii and E. kiwii oocysts in droppings despite recent administration of toltrazuril. These results suggest that the populations of Eimeria spp. affecting brown kiwi at this location appear to possess an ability to survive exposure to toltrazuril.

      "abstract": "In the last decade, the worldwide production of kiwi fruit has been highly affected by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), a phytopathogenic bacterium; this has led to severe economic losses that are seriously affecting the kiwi fruit trade. The available treatments for this disease are still scarce, with the most common involving frequently spraying the orchards with copper derivatives, in particular cuprous oxide (Cu2O). However, these copper formulations should be avoided due to their high toxicity; therefore, it is essential to search for new approaches for controlling Psa. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may be an alternative approach to inactivate Psa. aPDT consists in the use of a photosensitizer molecule (PS) that absorbs light and by transference of the excess of energy or electrons to molecular oxygen forms highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can affect different molecular targets, thus being very unlikely to lead to the development of microbe resistance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of aPDT to photoinactivate Psa, using the porphyrin Tetra-Py+-Me and different light intensities. The degree of inactivation of Psa was assessed using the PS at 5.0 μM under low irradiance (4.0 mW cm-2). Afterward, ex vivo experiments, using artificially contaminated kiwi leaves, were conducted with a PS at 50 μM under 150 mW cm-2 and sunlight irradiation. A reduction of 6 log in the in vitro assays after 90 min of irradiation was observed. In the ex vivo tests, the decrease was lower, approximately 1.8 log reduction at an irradiance of 150 mW cm-2, 1.2 log at 4.0 mW cm-2, and 1.5 log under solar radiation. However, after three successive cycles of treatment under 150 mW cm-2, a 4 log inactivation was achieved. No negative effects were observed on leaves after treatment. Assays using Cu2O were also performed at the recommended concentration by law (50 g h L-1) and at concentrations 10 times lower, in which at both concentrations, Psa was efficiently inactivated (5 log inactivation) after a few minutes of treatment, but negative effects were observed on the leaves after treatment.",

In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of the three cultivars of kiwi berries were investigated using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line. Mansoo had the highest total phenolic content and TAC among the three cultivars, whereas Chiak had the highest total flavonoid content. The total antioxidant capacities of the kiwi berry extracts were more strongly correlated with total phenolic content than with total flavonoid content. The kiwi berry extracts suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The release of nitrite, an indirect indicator of nitric oxide, was also ameliorated by pre-treatment with the kiwi berry extracts in a dose-dependent manner. Cellular-based measurements of antioxidant capacity exhibited that the kiwi berry extracts had cellular antioxidant capacities. Such cellular antioxidant effects are possibly attributed to their direct antioxidant capacity or to the inhibition of reactive oxygen species generation via anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings suggest that kiwi berries are potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ivacaftor has been shown to be a safe, effective treatment for cystic fibrosis in patients aged 6 years or older with a CFTR gating mutation. We aimed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ivacaftor in children aged 2-5 years. METHODS: In the two-part KIWI study, we enrolled children aged 2-5 years weighing 8 kg or more with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a CFTR gating mutation on at least one allele from 15 hospitals in the USA, UK, and Canada. Participants received oral ivacaftor 50 mg (if bodyweight <14 kg) or 75 mg (if bodyweight ≥14 kg) every 12 h for 4 days in part A (to establish the short-term safety of doses for subsequent assessment in part B), and then for 24 weeks in part B (to assess safety and longer-term pharmacodynamics). Children could participate in both or just one part of the study. Primary outcomes were pharmacokinetics and safety, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Secondary outcomes were absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentrations and bodyweight, body-mass index (BMI), and height Z scores, and pharmacokinetic parameter estimation of ivacaftor. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01705145. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8, 2013, and March 1, 2013, nine patients were enrolled onto part A of the study, all of whom completed the 4 day treatment period, and eight of whom took part in part B. Between June 28, 2013, and Sept 26, 2013, 34 patients were enrolled in part B, 33 of whom completed the 24 week treatment period. All patients received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Results of ivacaftor pharmacokinetics suggested that exposure was similar to that reported in adults (median Cmin were 536 ng/mL for the 50 mg dose; 580 ng/mL for the 75 mg dose; median ivacaftor AUC values were 9840 ng × h/mL and 10 200 ng × h/mL, respectively). Common adverse events in part B included cough (in 19 [56%] of 34 patients) and vomiting (in ten [29%]). Five (15%) patients had liver function test (LFT) results that were more than eight times higher than the upper limit of normal, four of whom had study drug interrupted, and one of whom had study drug discontinued. Six (18%) of 34 patients had seven serious adverse events; a raised concentration of transaminases was the only serious adverse event regarded as related to ivacaftor and the only adverse event that resulted in study treatment discontinuation. At week 24, in patients for whom we had data, sweat chloride had changed from baseline by a mean of -46·9 mmol/L (SD 26·2, p<0·0001), weight Z score by 0·2 (0·3; p<0·0001), BMI Z score by 0·4 (0·4, p<0·0001), and height Z score by -0·01 (0·3; p=0·84). INTERPRETATION: Ivacaftor at doses of 50 mg and 75 mg seems to be safe in children aged 2-5 years with cystic fibrosis with a gating mutation followed up for 24 weeks, although the frequency of elevated LFTs suggests that monitoring should be frequent in young children, particularly those with a history of elevated LFTs. Results of an ongoing extension study assessing durability of these effects and longer-term safety are warranted. FUNDING: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.",

After the treatment the fruits were immediately stored at 0 °C during 24 weeks. Flesh firmness gradually decreased with storage time and the rate of its loss was lower in 1-MCP and conditioning plus 1-MCP treatments than those of control or conditioning. However, SSC, acidity and pH did not change among treatments. Starch content decreased during the storage time regardless of treatments. Oppositely the amount of reducing sugars increased at the same duration of the treatments. Rate and incidence of fruit decay was the lowest in fruit treated with conditioning plus 1-MCP treatment. Fruit decay mainly caused pathogen Botrytis cinerea and its rate significantly decreased with conditioning plus 1-MCP treatment. Ethylene and respiration abruptly increased after 8 weeks of storage, but their contents were lower in 1-MCP and conditioning plus 1-MCP. Total soluble phenolics, flavonoids, and total antioxidant capacities were much higher than in other treatments. Kiwi fruits treated with conditioning plus 1-MCP extended the shelf life by reducing the rate of fruit decay and softening during the storage. The bioactive compounds and total antioxidant status of fruits increased during the treatment."

      "abstract": "The physical, biochemical, and immunological characteristics of plant allergens have been widely studied, but no definite conclusion has been reached about what actually makes a protein an allergen. In this sense, N-glycosylation is an exclusive characteristic of plant allergens not present in mammals and it could be implied in allergenic sensitization. With this aim, we evaluated and compared the allergenic activity of the protein fraction and the N-glycan fraction of the thaumatin-like protein and the main kiwi allergen, Act d 2. The natural allergen, Act d 2, was deglycosylated by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid treatment; the N-glycan fraction was obtained by extended treatment with proteinase K. N-glycan- and protein- fractions were recognized by specific IgE of kiwi-allergic patients. By contrast, the sugar moiety showed a reduced capacity to activate basophils and T cells, but not dendritic cells derived from patients' monocytes. Related to this, the production of cytokines such as IL6 and IL10 was increased by the incubation of dendritic cells with sugar moiety. Thus, the sugar moiety plays a significant role in sensitization, inducing the activation of antigen-presenting cells, but it is the protein fraction that is responsible for the allergic reactions."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Methylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive dicarbonyl compound generated as an intermediate of glycolysis during the physical glycation in the diabetic condition. MG itself has been commonly implicated in the development of diabetic neuropathy. Several active compounds in Actinidia callosa have been found to inhibit glycation and MG-protein reaction. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the protective effects of A. callosa (kiwi fruits) peel ethanol extracts (ACE) on MG-induced Neuro-2A cell apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Neuro-2A cells pre-treated by ACE (50-200 μg/mL) or allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC) (50 μM) for 6 h, in turn, the cells were treated with MG (250 μM) for 24 h. RESULTS: ACE or AITC treatment markedly inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the elevation of caspase-3 and capase-9 levels induced by MG in Neuro-2A cells. ACE and AITC elevated Bcl2 and inhibited Bax expressions in MG-induced Neuro-2A cells. ACE elevated Nrf2 transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation in MG-induced Neuro-2A cells. Nrf2 down-stream molecules including HO-1 and GCL were elevated by ACE or AITC treatment in MG-induced Neuro-2A cells. The protective effects of ACE on MG-induced Neuro-2A apoptosis were attenuated while Nrf2 knockdown. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We established the first evidence that ACE might contribute to the prevention of the development of diabetic neuropathy by blocking the MG-mediated intracellular glycation system.",

      "abstract": "Despite significant conservation intervention, the kiwi (Apteryx spp.) is in serious population decline. To increase survival in the wild, conservation management includes rearing of young birds in captivity, safe from introduced mammalian predators. However, an increase in density of immunologically naïve kiwi increases the risk of exposure to disease, including coccidia. Intestinal coccidiosis has recently been described in the kiwi, and although extra-intestinal coccidiosis was first recognized in kiwi in 1978, very little is known about this disease entity. This study used archived histological tissues and reports from routine necropsies to describe the pathology of naturally occurring extra-intestinal coccidiosis. At least 4.5% of all kiwi necropsied during 1991 to 2011 (n=558) were affected by extra-intestinal coccidiosis, and it is estimated that it caused death in 0.9 to 1.2% of kiwi in the study group. Four forms were recognized: renal, hepatic, and, less commonly, splenic and pulmonary. At necropsy, renal coccidiosis was associated with miliary white streaks and foci through the kidneys, renomegaly, and renal pallor or congestion. Renal meronts and gametocytes were confined to the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts, and were associated with renal tubular necrosis and tubular obstruction. Hepatic miliary pinpoint foci were present throughout the hepatic parenchyma associated microscopically with macromeronts measuring 304×227 µm. In two cases, clusters of splenic meronts were identified, and a similar lesion was identified in the pulmonary interstitium of another case. Juvenile, captive kiwi were most often affected with extra-intestinal coccidiosis, illustrating an increased expression of disease with population manipulation for conservation purposes.",

      "abstract": "A size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) method was implemented to study complex formation between carrot pectin methylesterase (PME) and its inhibitor (PMEI) from kiwi fruit in the context of traditional thermal and novel high-pressure processing. Evidence was gained that both thermal and high-pressure treatments of PME give rise to two distinct enzyme subpopulations: a catalytically active population, eluting from the size exclusion column, and an inactive population, aggregated and excluded from the column. When mixing a partly denatured PME sample with a fixed amount of PMEI, a PME-PMEI complex peak was observed on HPSEC, of which the peak area was highly correlated with the residual enzyme activity of the corresponding PME sample. This observation indicates complex formation to be restricted to the active PME fraction. When an equimolar mixture of PME and PMEI was subjected to either a thermal or a high-pressure treatment, marked differences were observed. At elevated temperature, enzyme and inhibitor remained united and aggregated as a whole, thus gradually disappearing from the elution profile. Conversely, elevated pressure caused the dissociation of the PME-PMEI complexes, followed by a separate action of pressure on enzyme and inhibitor. Remarkably, PMEI appeared to be pressure-resistant when compressed at acidic pH (ca. 4).",

Furthermore, therapeutic choices are limited, especially in long-standing cases, despite its increasing prevalence. This study was performed to examine the clinical efficacy and the therapeutic mechanism underlying the effects of Actinidia arguta (hardy kiwi) fruit extract in an animal model of AD. To examine the effects of A. arguta extract on AD, 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene-treated NC/Nga mice were orally administered A. arguta extract (100 mg/kg/day), tacrolimus (1 mg/kg/day), or dexamethasone (3 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Skin severity scores, epidermal thickening, mast cell infiltration and degranulation, total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes (IgE, IgG(1)), and cytokine (interleukin [IL]-4 and interferon [IFN]-gamma) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) (TLR-2, TLR-4, and TLR-9) expressions were examined in each of the study groups. Orally administered A. arguta extract significantly reduced clinical dermatitis severity, epidermal thickness, mast cell dermal infiltration and degranulation, and total levels of serum IgE and IgG(1). Furthermore, this suppression of total serum IgE and IgG(1) levels was accompanied by a decrease in IL-4 and an increase in IFN-gamma expression in skin and splenocytes. Interestingly, TLR-9 expression was increased by oral A. arguta extract. This study confirms that A. arguta extract has potential as a dietary therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD. Furthermore, our findings suggest that its clinical efficacy and mode of action against AD are associated with the modulation of biphasic T-helper (Th) 1/Th2 cytokines, with the inhibition of Th2-mediated IgE overproduction, and possibly with the up-regulation of TLR-9.",

      "abstract": "Canine atopic dermatitis (AD) is common and new therapies are beneficial. This multicentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study tested the efficacy of Actinidia arguta (hardy kiwi) (EFF1001) in dogs with mild/moderate AD. The study was divided into two stages. Stage 1 lasted 6 weeks. In the first 2 weeks prednisolone [days 1-3: 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (BID), days 4-14: 0.2 mg/kg every other day (EOD)] was administered. Responsive dogs were placed on prednisolone 0.2 mg/kg EOD + assigned test article [either placebo or EFF1001 (30 mg/kg)] once daily for 4 weeks. Stage 1 responders were advanced to stage 2, which involved 4 weeks of just EFF1001. Clinicians scored lesions using Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI) and owners scored pruritus using a Pruritus Visual Analogue Scale. Seventy-seven dogs were enrolled, 76 were randomized on day 14, and 57 (57/76 = 75%) completed stage 1 (27 in EFF1001 and 30 in placebo). At the end of stage 1, 35 of 57 dogs (35/57 = 61%) responded (18 in EFF1001 and 17 in placebo) and advanced to stage 2. At completion of stage 1, CADESI scores did not significantly differ between groups while pruritus decreased in EFF1001 group and approached significance. At completion of stage 2, 19 dogs (19/35 = 54%) responded (15/19 = 79% had received EFF1001 and 4/19 = 21% placebo in stage 1). After completing stage 2, dogs placed on EFF1001 throughout the study were 3.5 times more likely to either maintain or improve scores than those that started it in stage 2. It is concluded that EFF1001 is beneficial adjunctive therapy after prolonged use.",

Following a comparative analysis of the protein profiles in SDS-PAGE and IgE immunoblotting, a significant influence of conditions such as the ripening stage and the extraction method on the composition of green and gold kiwi fruit extracts was observed. Furthermore, the experimental data indicate that, mostly in the green species, a ripe fruit may have a different concentration of total proteins and a different amount of single components when ripeness is reached by different means of postharvest handling, such as ethylene exposure with or without previous cold storage. In summary, this study emphasizes the level of complexity associated with the preparation of extracts when a known and defined concentration of proteins/allergens is requested.",

A protein named KiTH, showing a 20 kDa band on reducing SDS-PAGE and 100% identity with the C-terminal region of kiwellin, has been identified in the extract of the ripe green species. In vitro treatment of purified kiwellin with the protease actinidin from green kiwi fruit originated KiTH and kissper, a recently described pore-forming peptide. Primary structure analysis and experimental evidence suggest that kiwellin is a modular protein with two domains. It may undergo in vivo proteolytic processing by actinidin, thus producing KiTH and kissper. When probed with sera recognizing kiwellin from green kiwi fruit, KiTH showed IgE binding, with reactivity levels sometimes different from those of kiwellin. The IgE-binding capacity of kiwellin from gold kiwi fruit appears to be similar to that of the green species.",

Post mortem examination revealed accumulation of thick mucus in the oral cavity and trachea. There was severe pulmonary congestion and oedema and early bronchopneumonia in the lungs of five of the birds. In two birds, there was acute hepatic degeneration and necrosis and one bird had acute pancreatic degeneration and necrosis. DIAGNOSIS: Acute levamisole toxicity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Kiwi were acutely sensitive to levamisole toxicity at doses that are well within the safe range for domestic poultry. Levamisole should not be used as an anthelmintic in kiwi.",

The inhibition kinetics of kiwi fruit PMEI to banana and strawberry PME followed a noncompetitive type, whereas that to carrot PME followed a competitive type. The kiwi fruit PMEI was mixed with banana, carrot, and strawberry PME to obtain PMEI-PME complexes, which were then subjected to thermal (40-80 degrees C, atmospheric pressure) or high-pressure (10 degrees C, 100-600 MPa) treatment. Experimental data showed that the PMEI-PME complexes were easily dissociated by both thermal and high-pressure treatments.",

To assess tolerance to heated kiwifruit in children allergic to fresh kiwifruit. In this prospective trial, 20 children (median age 9.4 yr) with a history of immediate allergic reactions to fresh kiwifruit underwent double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges with steam-cooked (100 degrees C for 5') and industrially homogenised kiwifruit. Skin prick tests with a commercial kiwifruit allergen, raw kiwifruit and double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge with 25 g of fresh kiwifruit were used to confirm the history. Specific kiwifruit IgE to native and homogenized fruit were identified by immunoblotting. Fresh kiwifruit induced positive skin prick wheals in all children (confirmed during challenge in 19 patients). Commercial skin prick test elicited a positive response in five children, steam-cooked kiwifruit in five, and the homogenised kiwifruit preparation in none. UniCAP determinations were positive for kiwifruit in three patients. All children's sera showed specific IgE at immunoblotting with raw kiwifruit and one with the homogenised preparation (major allergens identified: Act c 1 and Act c 2). There was no clinical reactivity following challenge with homogenised kiwifruit but one child reacted to cooked kiwifruit challenge. Industrial heat treatment and homogenisation can make kiwifruit safe for children who are allergic to this increasingly popular fruit. This has dietary implications for children who are allergic to several fruit and vegetable proteins.",

The optimal protocol established was the following: shoot tips were sampled on mother-plants after a one month cold-acclimation period at 5 degrees C. For preculture, which was performed at 5 degrees C, encapsulated shoot tips were transferred at 24-hour intervals on solid media with increasing sucrose concentrations, from 0.5 to 1.0M. Beads were then desiccated to 26% moisture content (fresh weight basis), prefrozen from 0 degrees C to -40 degrees C at 0.2 degrees C/min and immersed rapidly in liquid nitrogen. No differences were noted between in vitro plantlets produced from cryopreserved and control shoot tips as regards leaf color, average height, multiplication rate and peroxidase zymogram pattern. Apices of 3 kiwi accessions were frozen using the above protocol with regrowth percentages ranging between 22 and 56%.",

METHODS: An epidemiological study of neuropsychological change during the menopausal transition among Chinese women aged 40-54 years old on the islet of Kinmen. RESULTS: Of a targeted population of 2256 individuals, 1497 (66%) participated in the study. The mean age at menarche was 15.6 years and that at menopause was 48 years. The hormone use rate at the time of study was 23% in surgical menopausal women, and 9% were past users. After excluding surgical menopausal and premenopausal women, 6% reported a current use of estrogen replacement therapy and 6% were past users. The most frequently reported discomforts for those women aged >45 were troubled sleep, backaches, and joint pain. Four symptom clusters: musculoskeletal, non-specific somatic complaints, urogenital, and vasomotor, were identified. After adjustment for age, the urogenital and vasomotor symptoms were significantly associated with menopausal status. CONCLUSIONS: The age at menopause did not differ much from Western studies, but the menopausal symptoms, especially the vasomotor symptoms, were much lower in our study population. Nevertheless, vasomotor symptoms were still significantly associated with menopausal status.",

      "abstract": "Fruit allergy is frequently associated with birch pollinosis. The aim of this study was to investigate which kiwi allergens were involved in subjects allergic to fruit alone and in patients allergic to both fruit and birch pollen. Sera of nine patients (five with both kiwi and birch pollen allergy and four with isolated kiwi allergy) were studied by immunoblot of kiwi extract. Eight of the nine sera reacted with the 30 kDa protein. Furthermore, IgE-binding proteins were seen at approximately 23 kDa (detected by five sera), 43 kDa and 80 kDa (four sera), and > 80 kDa (two sera). One serum showed no IgE binding to any kiwi allergen. The 30 kDa is the major allergen in kiwi and was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and characterized by isoelectrofocusing and amino acid sequencing. The comparison of its partial amino acid sequence with data from the Swiss Protein Bank revealed that this protein is actinidine. The carbohydrate structures in kiwi and birch pollen extracts were investigated with seven lectins. On kiwi blot, Aleuria aurantia agglutinin showed strong reactivity (indicating fucose residues) to the components of 35 to 92 kDa, while concanavalin A (indicating mannose, glucose or N-acetylglucosamine residues) showed weak binding at 67 kDa. In contrast, strong binding of Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (indicating mannose residues) and concanavalin A was found on birch pollen blots. The presence of IgE against carbohydrate structures was determined by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after periodate treatment of kiwi extract. The IgE binding was reduced by periodate treatment of kiwi coated microtiter plates, but not by sera reacting exclusively with the 30 kDa protein. Furthermore, selected sera were treated with proteinase K-digested kiwi and birch pollen extracts as the sources of crossreactive carbohydrate determinants. In accordance with the results of sodium periodate treatment, significant levels of anti-cross-reactive carbohydrate determinant IgE were found in sera from patients allergic to both kiwi and birch pollen. Our results show that the major allergen for kiwi allergy is the 30 kDa protein and additionally that the cross-reaction between kiwi and birch pollen allergy is mainly due to carbohydrate moieties.",
