      "abstract": "Background: To examine the changes in perceived tinnitus sound qualities following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus. Method: This study was embedded within several clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of ICBT and used a quasi-experimental design (N = 152). Participants completed a series of online questionnaires, including measures of tinnitus sound qualities (Tinnitus Qualities and Impact Questionnaire; TQIQ), tinnitus severity (Tinnitus Functional Index; TFI), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index; ISI), and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale; VAS). Data were analyzed using a range of parametric and non-parametric statistics, and Cohen's d effect sizes were reported. Results: There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in sociodemographic and clinical variables at baseline except for anxiety and depression symptoms, which were higher in the intervention group. A statistically significant reduction in tinnitus severity, anxiety, depression, and insomnia was noted post-intervention, with small-to-moderate effect sizes. Statistically significant improvements were also noted for the TQIQ (overall and all subscales) following ICBT compared to the no-intervention group (p ≤ 0.028), all with small-to-large effect sizes, except for the loud sounds subscale and for participants with a TQIQ < 38 at baseline, or \"mild\" perceived qualities of tinnitus (p ≥ 0.136). A significantly greater proportion of participants in the intervention group had minimum clinically important differences (38%) on the TQIQ compared to the no-intervention group (9%). Conclusions: ICBT can lead to changes in the perceived qualities of tinnitus sound in addition to reducing tinnitus severity and other aspects, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. While these findings are preliminary, they highlight that tinnitus distress and perception may be related. However, the study has several limitations including a lack of audiological variables and objective measures. For this reason, the study results must be viewed with caution and must be treated as preliminary."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As a substitute for traditional drug therapy, digital cognitive-behavioral therapy positively impacts the regulation of brain function, which can improve insomnia. However, there is currently a paucity of studies on digital cognitive behavioral therapy as a treatment for insomnia. AIM: To assess digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia regarding its positive impact on brain function. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to either a go/no-go group or a dot-probe group. The primary outcome was quality of sleep as assessed by the actigraphy sleep monitoring bracelet, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), insomnia severity index (ISI), and depression anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Eighty patients were included in the analysis (go/no-go group: n = 40; dot-probe group: n = 40). We combined the total scale scores of the two groups before and after the intervention in the analysis of covariance. Our study explored whether insomnia symptoms in both groups can be improved by using digital cognitive behavioral therapy instead of trying to compare the two trials; therefore, only one P value is listed. In both groups, we found a short-term time effect on insomnia symptom severity (PSQI: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.336; ISI: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.667; DASS-depression: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.582; DASS-anxiety: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.337; DASS-stress: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.443) and some effect on sleep efficiency (but it was not significant, P = 0.585, η 2 = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Go/no-go task training of inhibitory function had a short-term positive effect on sleep efficiency, whereas dot-probe task training had a positive short-term effect on emotion regulation."

However, few studies focus on the influence of Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) on brain network, particularly among Chinese undergraduates. This study aims to conduct resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to explore the effects of ICBT on neurofunctional network. METHODS: This short-term longitudinal study enrolled 30 sD patients and 24 healthy matched participants. We gathered the clinical measurements outcomes from sD patients. Baseline and post-intervention MRI scans were performed for the sD patients, additionally, a matched healthy controls group underwent baseline MRI scans, functional network matrix was established from the temporal rs-MRI series. Nodal efficiency (Enod) was quantified by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of network metrics. RESULTS: The patients with sD exhibited reduced clinical measurement scores after ICBT intervention. Moreover, after ICBT intervention, functional network analysis revealed an increased Enod in the orbital part of the left inferior frontal gyrus, and decreased Enod in the left paracentral lobule and right precentral gyrus. CONCLUSION: This study showed alterations in brain network in patients with sD after ICBT intervention. These findings shed light on the neurofunctional mechanisms underlying the effects of ICBT in sD patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Long-lasting dizziness is a distressing and disabling condition frequently accompanied by psychological and physical discomfort, and if untreated, could evolve into a complex, self-perpetuating condition challenging treatment. A treatment approach addressing psychological, physical, and social ailments in connection with long-term dizziness has been developed. The objective of this study was to explore experiences and perceptions of participants with long-lasting dizziness who have engaged in a group-based intervention approach that combines principles from vestibular rehabilitation (VR), body awareness therapy (BA), and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in primary care. METHODS: The study is rooted in an interpretative approach. Fifteen participants, 10 women and 5 men, aged 38 to 71 years, were interviewed in 3 focus groups. Data were analyzed by systematic text condensation, a 4-step thematic cross-case strategy suitable for exploratory investigations. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the analyses: 1) To share and feel understood when struggling with dizziness, 2) The exercises: body perceptions and challenging one's own limits to control dizziness, 3) Increased self-knowledge helps to process anxiety and challenge avoidance behavior, 4) Changing habits is hard work, but necessary to recover from dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: This novel group-based VR-BA-CBT treatment for individuals with long-lasting dizziness offered valuable peer support, shared learning, and learning in action providing new understanding. The VR-BA-CBT treatment includes a comprehensive and holistic approach addressing physical, psychological, and social challenges. IMPACT: Through knowledge about dizziness triggers, participants learn new strategies to confront previously avoided activities. The approach holds promise to be implemented in primary care physical therapy settings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The current study aims to explore the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in normalizing social learning capabilities and its underlying neural processes among patients with MDD, in terms of enhancing learning towards positive social feedback, and reducing excessive learning towards negative social feedback. This study also explores the potential for learning impairments in social contexts as a biomarker to predict the effectiveness of CBT. METHODS: In a single-centre, single-arm, open-label trial, 60 outpatients with MDD will undergo 12 sessions of CBT in three months. Data collection of patients will be administered at baseline and at the endpoint of the treatment. Additionally, 60 heathy controls will be recruited as a comparative group to assess deviations from the normal functions in the patients with MDD before and after CBT. Data collection of the HC group will be administered at baseline. Data collection of the two groups comprises of demographic information, clinical assessments, psychological assessments, and behavioral experiments (i.e. the Door Game and the Trust Game) in conjuction with task-based function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Data analysis comprises of an estimation of social learning capabilities by computational modeling, and identification of baseline abnormalities, treatment effects and endpoint abnormalities on social learning capabilities and its neural activities. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to assess the efficacy of CBT in normalizing social learning capabilities among patients with MDD by leveraging high ecological validity paradigms and computational modeling. This trial also contributes to understanding psychosocial biomarkers of CBT treatment effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is recognized as one of the most effective methods for reducing the risk of perinatal depression. However, the traditional face-to-face delivery format limits its accessibility. With the advent of digital technology, app-based CBT offers new possibilities, yet its preventive role in perinatal depression remains insufficiently explored. This study aims to determine if pregnant women using an app-based CBT program report reduced depressive and anxious symptoms compared to a control group. METHODS: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial of 290 pregnant women will be conducted at Jintang County Maternity and Child Health Hospital in Chengdu, China. Eligible participants who consent to participate will be recruited at 20-24 weeks of gestation and randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which will complete an 8-week mobile app-based CBT program (CareMom), or a control group, which will receive an attention-matched 8-week relaxation training program, also delivered via a mobile app. Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random number sequence. Primary outcomes include changes in scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item from baseline to 6 weeks postpartum. Outcome analyses will be performed on both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. DISCUSSION: This trial evaluates an app-based CBT program for reducing the risk of perinatal depression. Improved maternal mental health not only benefits the mothers themselves but also may facilitate more optimal parenting behaviors, which could exert a positive influence on the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development of the infant.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a virtual, group-based heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback-enhanced coping skills intervention for youth with IBD. Treatment targets included symptoms of anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and perceived stress. METHODS: Youth with IBD (ages 13-18) and their caregivers were randomized to either immediate treatment or waitlist control groups. The intervention consisted of 6 virtually delivered, weekly group sessions combining cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with HRV biofeedback training. Outcomes included measures of anxiety, depression, GI symptoms, perceived stress, and HRV parameters. Assessments were conducted at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Of the 53 youth randomized, 50 participated in their assigned group. The intervention demonstrated strong feasibility with 84% of participants attending at least 4 of 6 sessions. Both adolescents and parents reported strong satisfaction. Following treatment, parents reported significant decreases in adolescent depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and GI symptoms compared to controls. Adolescents reported reductions in GI symptoms and perceived stress compared to controls and reductions in symptoms of anxiety within the treatment group. No changes were observed in HRV parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study supports the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual, group-based HRV biofeedback-enhanced coping skills intervention for youth with IBD. Preliminary efficacy was demonstrated for reducing psychological and physical symptoms. Future research should evaluate efficacy in a larger, more diverse sample with elevated baseline psychological symptoms."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is prevalent, particularly among individuals with mental health complaints. However, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), the first-line treatment, is underutilized in care settings. This study evaluated a therapist-guided digital CBT-I (i-Sleep), gathering insights from participants and therapists to optimize the intervention and inform implementation strategies. METHODS: A mixed-methods process evaluation, guided by the RE-AIM framework, was conducted alongside an effectiveness trial. Data were collected from i-Sleep participants with clinically relevant insomnia and various mental health complaints across all care levels, ranging from pre-clinical (unattended), to those referred to general or specialized care. Additionally, data were collected from i-Sleep therapists. RESULTS: A total of 181 i-Sleep participants (mean age = 46.7 years, SD = 13.2) enrolled, with an attrition rate of 21.6%. Participants reported benefits including faster sleep onset, fewer nighttime awakenings, increased daytime energy, and positive lifestyle changes, though some experienced minimal gains or adverse effects. Satisfaction with the intervention ranged from 7.1 to 7.3 across care levels. Post-intervention, 89.4% of all participants indicated they would recommend iCBT-I. Satisfaction with therapist guidance was high (M = 7.7-8.3), though preferences for format and frequency varied. Therapists (n = 15, mean experience = 0.8 years, SD = 1.1) suggested addressing practical constraints and enhancing training for better integration into routine care. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the feasibility and potential of therapist-guided iCBT-I to improve sleep in individuals with mental health complaints across all care settings. Universal implementation could offer significant benefits, while adaptable content and flexible guidance may better meet individual needs.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can improve CRF in those with insomnia comorbid with cancer. This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigated what proportion of participants benefit and the factors associated with an improvement in CRF following CBT-I. METHODS: Atlantic Canadian cancer survivors (N = 121) with insomnia disorder and perceived cognitive impairment symptoms were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial of CBT-I. Fatigue was measured using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form. Univariable and multivariable binary logistic regressions were used to assess clinical, symptom, and demographic factors associated with a significant improvement in CRF after CBT-I. RESULTS: The majority (75%) of the sample (Mage = 60.12 years, 77% women, 45% breast cancer) experienced a significant reduction in CRF symptoms following the intervention. Being younger (under 55), being female, having anxiety, and undergoing chemotherapy were associated with a greater likelihood of improvement in CRF at the univariable level. At the multivariable level, only younger age was significantly associated with an improvement in CRF after CBT-I. CONCLUSION: CBT-I can effectively reduce CRF in cancer survivors who also experience insomnia. Differences in sleep patterns and/or the number of comorbid physical health concerns between younger and older people may explain why CBT-I improved CRF more in younger participants. Future research is needed to better understand the demographic, symptom, and clinical variables that may influence treatment response.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the Philippines, an estimated 1.8 million people use methamphetamine. Despite the government's anti-drug campaign, repressive methods have been ineffective. Thus, treatment and human services are needed. We developed a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for residential and rehabilitation center-based treatment and examined its effectiveness. METHODS: In this block-randomized single-blinded trial, control group participants received therapeutic community-type treatment only, while the intervention group additionally participated in our CBT program for 6 months. Primary outcomes were methamphetamine re-use, measured by urine tests and self-report at 3-months post-discharge, and self-reported well-being at pre-discharge and 3-months post-discharge. FINDINGS: Participants (n = 326) were randomized into intervention (n = 162) and control (n = 164) groups. At follow-up, 3/27 (11.11 %) and 1/27 (3.70 %) participants in the respective groups had positive urine tests for drug re-use (χ2(1) = 1.08, n.s., r = 0.037, 95 %CI [-0.064, 0.212]). The self-reported drug re-use rate was significantly higher in the intervention group (χ2(1) = 9.18, p < 0.01, r = 0.14 (95 %CI [0.050, 0.231]). However, pre-discharge self-rated health (F(1, 311) = 6.32, p < 0.025, η2 = 0.02, 95 %CI [0.001, 0.06]) and problem-focused coping (F(1, 311) = 6.50, p < 0.025, η2 = 0.021, 95 %CI [0.001, 0.06]) were significantly better among intervention group participants than among control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Although without significant effect on drug re-use, the intervention had a small positive effect on patients' well-being, coping skills, and other psychological variables. Additional research is required to develop effective treatments for methamphetamine use in this region."

      "abstract": "Many psychotherapy interventions have a large evidence base and can help a substantial number of people with symptoms of mental health conditions. However, we still have little understanding of why treatments work. Early advances in psychotherapy, such as the development of exposure therapy, built on theoretical and experimental evidence from Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning. More generally, all psychotherapy achieves change through learning. The past 25 years have seen substantial developments in computational models of learning, with increased computational precision and a focus on multiple learning mechanisms and their interaction. Now might be a good time to formalize psychotherapy interventions as computational models of learning to improve our understanding of mechanisms of change in psychotherapy. To advance research and help bring together a new joint field of theory-driven computational psychotherapy, we first review literature on cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring) and introduce computational models of reinforcement learning and representation learning. We then suggest a mapping of these learning algorithms on change processes presumably underlying the effects of exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring. Finally, we outline how the understanding of interventions through the lens of learning algorithms can inform intervention research."

Stepped care addresses this gap, although there is limited research into its broad effects in autistic youth with anxiety. In this project, 76 autistic youth with anxiety entered parent-led-bibliotherapy for 12 weeks; 44 stepped up to receive therapist-led cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Those who did not step up entered a maintenance phase. Youth were assessed for externalizing and depressive symptoms at mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3 months after treatment (3MFU). Focal symptoms decreased across groups at all timepoints; those who entered maintenance experienced greater decreases. At 3MFU there were no differences between groups. Parents were assessed for depression, anxiety, and stress at the same timepoints; no significant changes were observed.",

While these groups receive state support for physical and legal safety, mental health and sleep-focused interventions remain insufficient. Collaborating with a Mexico City-based institution supporting human rights defenders and journalists, we conducted a psychometric assessment of 47 individuals affected by violence. Results showed that 80% exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, 25.5% showed depression, and 57.4% displayed anxiety; 95.7% reported poor sleep quality based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In a second phase, neuropsychological tests and polysomnographic recordings identified cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision-making in some participants, along with sleep disorders such as insomnia, primary snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, and bruxism. A third phase introduced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia, nightmares, and circadian rhythm issues. Results showed improvements in sleep quality, total sleep time, and a reduction in depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. This approach suggests that treating sleep issues in high-risk populations can improve mental health."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults is common and characterized by difficulties in regulation of attention, activity and goal directed behaviors. These challenges are especially associated with inattentive symptoms, why high levels of inattention imply severe impairment in everyday life. CBT for ADHD-inattentive presentation, (CADDI), is designed to treat inattention and incorporates skills training in organization, behavioral activation, and mindfulness. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of CADDI with regular CBT treatment for ADHD. METHODS: A multicenter, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial compared CADDI to Hesslinger's dialectical behavior therapy protocol. The study included 108 participants from six psychiatric outpatient clinics in Stockholm. Self-reported scales were used to assess outcome measures of behavioral activation, procrastination, symptoms of ADHD, depression, quality of life and functional impairment. Data were analyzed for between and within-group effects using multilevel modeling. RESULTS: Between-group analysis showed that participants in the CADDI group had significantly greater improvement on the primary outcome measure of activation at post assessment (p = .045, d = 0.49). No significant between-group effect was found on the other measures. However, within-group analysis showed larger effect sizes in the CADDI condition relative to the control condition on several measures. Adherence was good and attrition 21.3% despite effects of the pandemic. Participants and therapists reported higher satisfaction with CADDI as compared to the control group. DISCUSSION: This trial demonstrated that CADDI was more effective regarding behavioral activation and suggests a potential advantage of an intervention specifically targeting ADHD-I over generic CBT for ADHD. However, the trial was underpowered and failed to prove between-group effects in spite of large differences in effect sizes on several measures. Future research with larger samples and long-term follow-ups is recommended to validate and expand upon these results."

Yet, little is known about how this interest is realized and hence the overall status, prospects, and possible challenges of AI4CBT as a field (e.g. breadth of the field, key topics and methods, key producing countries/institutions/authors, interdisciplinary grounding). This paper addresses this gap by developing a broad-spectrum bibliometric analysis towards acquiring a comprehensive overview of the AI4CBT field. Four key dimensions are analyzed (productivity, producers, productions, and contents) along the array of bibliographic metrics, including production trends over time, leading contributors at various levels, co-authorship, citation, and keywords co-occurrence networks, publication formats, key venues, methodological trends, and disciplinary assessment. The paper concludes by framing the status of AI4CBT as a scientific field, allowing to tie it to scientific and applicative challenges and opportunities that AI4CBT may encounter and offer as it further develops.",

Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) and virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) are effective treatment approaches for SAD. However, few studies have integrated both, particularly in Chinese communities. This study examines the effectiveness of a 14-week iCBT program that includes VRET, called \"Ease Anxiety in Social Event Online\" (Ease Online), among Hong Kong adults with SAD. METHOD: 329 Hong Kong Chinese adults with SAD were randomized into web-based iCBT with VRET (n = 117), app-based iCBT with VRET (n = 111), or waitlist control (WLC) (n = 101) groups. The mean age was 30.49 years old (SD = 9.34), with 36 % male and 64 % female. Assessments were administered at pre-test, post-test, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The primary outcome measure was the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). Data were analysed by using linear regression and mixed effects models. RESULTS: Both treatment groups were superior to WLC group on both the primary and secondary measure outcomes. The effects were comparable between the two formats. Improvements were maintained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The rate of reliable improvement based on the SPIN was 34 % and 40 % in the web-based and app-based iCBT groups, respectively, compared to 11 % in the WLC group, and 15 % and 23 % who meet the criteria for remission of social anxiety, compared to 3 % in the WLC group. CONCLUSIONS: Both web- and app-based ICBT with VRET are effective for Hong Kong Chinese adults with SAD. The programme is an effective treatment approach for Hong Kong Chinese with SAD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and gut-directed hypnosis (GDH) are the two most widely used brain-gut behavior therapies (BGBT) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but nearly all that is known about their clinical effects comes from formal trials rather than clinical practice. We aimed to collect data from BGBT practitioners on their use and perception of these treatments, including positive and negative effects in their most recently treated patients. METHODS: Rome Foundation Psychogastroenterology section listserv members and other clinicians known to regularly treat IBS with CBT or GDH (166 total) were invited via email to participate in a de-identified Internet survey. The survey included questions about their demographics, nature of their clinical practice, ratings of different outcomes for their last two patients completing each treatment, adverse effects of treatment, factors perceived as important for successful treatment outcomes, and use of virtual therapy. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 58 therapists. Most (82.8%) reported using both CBT and GDH in their practice. Their ratings of outcomes for their last two patients completing each treatment (ratings for a total of 162 patients included in analysis) showed moderate or large positive treatment effects for a substantial majority of patients in four of the five outcome domains for both therapies, including improvements in bowel symptoms, emotional symptoms, life functioning, and ability to cope with/self-manage IBS symptoms. Adverse effects (rated as mild, moderate, or severe) associated with therapy were reported for six CBT patients (5.2%, all mild) and two GDH patients (2.7%; 1 mild, 1 moderate). The mean number of sessions was 9.6 for CBT (range 2-76) and 7.6 for GDH (range 3-23). Treatment was entirely or partly virtual (via video) for 79.5% of CBT and 76.9% of GDH patients. Most therapists using virtual therapy rated it as at least as effective as in-person therapy for both CBT (86.8%) and GDH (78.4%). Only one therapist reported having ever encountered serious adverse effects of GDH, and two therapists for CBT, in their clinical careers. CONCLUSION: This survey provides a unique real-world snapshot of current practice and experiences among therapists treating IBS with CBT and/or GDH. The results indicate that both therapies provide multiple moderate or large therapeutic benefits for the majority of treated IBS patients, with a very low burden of associated adverse effects. Virtual delivery is now the norm for these interventions and is generally found to be as effective as in-person treatment by the therapists."

The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) versus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on emotion regulation, mindfulness, and cognitive-executive functions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a clinical trial with two intervention groups and one control group. The number of 96 patients referred to the rheumatology clinic was selected using random sampling and divided into two intervention groups and a control group. In this study, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Stroop task, Tower of London task, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Task were used at baseline, posttest, and follow-up. Data were analyzed by SPSS22 using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measurements. RESULTS: The findings showed that MBSR and CBT have significant effects on mindfulness (P > 001), emotion regulation (P > 001), and cognitive-executive functions (P > 001). Specifically, MBSR led to greater improvements in emotion regulation and mindfulness, while CBT led to greater improvement in cognitive-executive functions. CONCLUSION: MBSR and CBT can be used as effective treatments to improve emotion regulation, mindfulness, and cognitive-executive functions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

      "abstract": "Subthreshold depression, defined as a depressive status falling short of the diagnostic threshold for major depression, is common, disabling and constitutes a risk factor for future depressive episodes. Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) have been shown to be effective but are usually provided as packages of various skills. Little research has been done to investigate whether all their components are beneficial and contributory to mental health promotion. We addressed this issue by developing a smartphone CBT app that implements five representative CBT skills (behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, assertion training and behavior therapy for insomnia), and conducting a master randomized study that included four 2 × 2 factorial trials to enable precise estimation of skill-specific efficacies. Between September 2022 and February 2024, we recruited 3,936 adult participants with subthreshold depression. Among those randomized, the follow-up rate was 97% at week 6 and adherence to the app was 84%. The study showed that all included CBT skills and their combinations differentially beat all three control conditions of delayed treatment, health information or self-check, with effect sizes ranging between -0.67 (95% confidence interval: -0.81 to -0.53) and -0.16 (-0.30 to -0.02) for changes in depressive symptom severity from baseline to week 6, as measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Knowledge of the active ingredients of CBT can better inform the design of more effective and scalable psychotherapies in the future. (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000047124 )."

We aimed to determine if PPD could be prevented with online 1-day cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based workshops. Methods: This randomized controlled trial enrolled pregnant persons at 28-38 weeks gestation at increased risk for PPD, living in Ontario and free of current DSM-5 major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants received the workshop plus treatment as usual (TAU; experimental group) or TAU alone (control group). We assessed MDD diagnosis, levels of PPD symptoms, anxiety, social support, mother-infant relationship, and infant temperament at 1, 2, and 3 months postpartum. The primary outcome was MDD at 3 months postpartum assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Results: Since <10% of participants developed MDD, trial recruitment was stopped early. Data were collected up to 2 months postpartum in those already enrolled. Among these participants (n = 124), reductions in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were seen in the experimental group at 2 months but were not statistically significant (P = .06). Higher risk participants (baseline EPDS ≥7) in the experimental group showed larger, statistically significant reductions (P<.05) in PPD and anxiety at 2 months postpartum. Limitations: Eligibility criteria resulted in a sample that did not develop MDD at rates high enough to continue the trial and limited study statistical power. Conclusions: Definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of online 1-day workshops for preventing PPD are not possible, but these results may warrant future testing with a higher risk sample.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The inclusion of behavioral therapy and stress reduction techniques among vocational students of the Nigerian universities is crucial for enhancing their practical skill acquisition and career prospects in challenging academic scenarios. This study explored the combined effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction in reducing test anxiety among business education students in a measurement and evaluation course. METHODS: Employing a randomized control trial with a pretest-posttest design, the research draws responses from 483 students from two universities in Southeast Nigeria. The participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or waitlist control groups on the basis of set inclusion criteria. Data collection was conducted via four different instruments, and the treatment group participated in a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (CBT-MBSR) program. Evaluations of both groups were conducted at three different stages: before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and during the follow-up period. Analysis was carried out via repeated-measures ANOVA and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). RESULTS: The results indicated that TVET students who underwent the CBT-MBSR intervention had significantly lower post-treatment test anxiety scores than those in the wait-list control group. The intervention also had a significant multivariate effect on reducing test anxiety, improved mindfulness, students' academic achievement, and their well-being (F value = 1168.52 (p =.001, η² = 0.752). CONCLUSION: This study assessed the efficacy of CBT with MBSR in reducing test anxiety, improving academic performance, and increasing well-being among students in TVET settings. The study revealed how CBT helped reduce test anxiety, thereby improving students' academic performance through increasing their concentration. Thus, this study provides fresh knowledge on how to improve psychological well-being and educational performance by introducing a new method of combining MBSR and CBT, which enriches the literature with a dual-modality approach that helps students reduce their anxieties and fosters their personal growth. This study has practical implications for university administrators, educators, and researchers and offers several recommendations. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

The present study was based on a post hoc analysis, aiming to explore the association between subtypes of insomnia disorder and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). METHODS: The present study was conducted on data of 118 patients with chronic insomnia disorder combined mild anxiety or/and depressive symptoms, who had completed an 8-week randomized controlled trial of CBT-I vs CBT-I plus (CBT-I combined with modules targeting anxiety and depressive symptoms). The silhouette coefficient determined the optimal number of clusters, and a K-means clustering analysis was performed. T-tests were conducted to assess baseline differences at eight weeks, and the changes in self-reported total sleep time (sTST), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD-17), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores in order to explore the impact of subtypes and treatment approaches (CBT-I and CBT-I plus) on insomnia and emotional symptoms.

Subtype 2 was characterized by significantly poorer baseline sleep quality (PSQI: 16.59 vs 12.74, t = -9.90, p < 0.01), higher depressive (HRSD: 18.47 vs 13.21, t = -8.37, p < 0.01), and anxiety levels (HAMA: 17.47 vs 13.46, t = -6.23, p < 0.01), and shorter sTST (4.67 vs 6.09 h, t = 8.31, p < 0.01) compared to Subtype 1. Post-treatment analyses showed significant improvements in both subtypes, with Subtype 2 experiencing a larger increase in sleep duration (csTST: 0.58 vs 1.77 h, t = -7.18, p < 0.01) and more pronounced improvements in sleep quality (cPSQI: 6.92 vs 8.88, t = -3.57, p < 0.001), depression (cHRSD: 8.07 vs 10.59, t = -2.71, p = 0.008), and anxiety (cHAMA: 9.28 vs 11.22, t = -2.56, p = 0.012). Despite these improvements, Subtype 1 maintained significantly better outcomes in sleep quality (PSQI: 5.81 vs 7.71, p < 0.01), depression (HRSD: 5.14 vs 7.89, p < 0.01), and anxiety (HAMA: 4.18 vs 6.25, p < 0.01) at 8 weeks. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between treatment groups within subtypes, indicating homogeneity. Within Cluster 1, CBT-I plus was more effective in reducing depressive symptoms (cHRSD: t = -2.48, p = 0.016), whereas CBT-I was superior in enhancing sTST in Cluster 2 (t = 2.01, p = 0.049), with no significant differences in other measures. CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the heterogeneity within ID subtypes and the differential response of sleep quality and depressive symptoms to CBT-I and CBT-I plus, highlighting the importance of personalized treatment strategies based on insomnia subtypes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canadian public safety personnel (PSP) report high rates of mental health concerns and barriers to treatment. PSPNET is a clinical research unit that offers internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) that is free, confidential, and developed with and for PSP. Treatment outcomes are promising with clinically significant symptom improvement (eg, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress) and favorable treatment satisfaction. While these results are promising, research has yet to explore ways to optimize therapist-guided ICBT for leaders within public safety. Optimizing ICBT for leaders is particularly important given their widespread organizational impact. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate (1) the perceived mental health stressors of Canadian leaders within public safety, (2) the degree to which leaders perceived existing therapist-guided ICBT courses tailored for PSP (ie, PSP Wellbeing Course and PSP PTSD Course) as suitable for their needs, and (3) ways to further optimize therapist-guided ICBT for public safety leaders. METHODS: This study included 10 clients who self-identified as being in a supervisory or leadership position within their public safety organization and completed either the therapist-guided PSP Wellbeing Course or PSP PTSD Course. We used descriptive statistics to analyze demographics, mental health symptoms, treatment engagement, and treatment satisfaction. We also used a reflexive thematic analysis of semistructured interview transcripts to assess leaders' course perceptions and feedback. RESULTS: Canadian leaders within public safety reported occupational and nonoccupational stressors and enrolled in ICBT to support their own or colleagues' mental health. Most clients enrolled in the PSP Wellbeing Course, accessed 4 of 5 lessons (n=7, 70%), engaged with therapist support (n=7, 70%), and identified as employed (n=8, 80%), White (n=8, 80%), and men (n=7, 70%) with an average age of 45 years. At pretreatment, 80% of clients endorsed clinically significant symptoms of one or more disorders; most often depression (n=7, 70%) and anger (n=6, 60%). Clients reported favorable attitudes toward the ICBT courses with most reporting that they were satisfied with the course (n=9, 90%). Feedback to further optimize ICBT content for leaders included the development of a leader case story (n=6, 60%) and new resources to help leaders apply skills learned in ICBT within the context of their leadership roles (n=4, 40%). Leaders also recommended optimizing ICBT delivery by improving the platform technology and incorporating more multimedia. CONCLUSIONS: Canadian leaders within public safety perceived therapist-guided ICBT developed with and for PSP as a suitable treatment option for their needs and identified ways to further optimize its content and delivery. Future research should investigate the impacts of these efforts and explore optimizing ICBT for other groups of clients.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This review will identify and compare diverse approaches to group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). INTRODUCTION: CBT is an established treatment for OCD. Although the benefits of group CBT are well known, its practice varies widely. Despite the growing number of studies on group CBT, the extent of heterogeneity in its structure and content has not been examined. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligibility criteria will include adult patients (18 years or older) of any gender, with a primary diagnosis of OCD. Articles must report on group CBT implemented as a treatment, specifically focusing on the number, frequency, duration, and format of sessions; number of participants; program content; and therapists' profession. The review will include both experimental and quasi-experimental designs, analytical observational studies, qualitative research, mixed methods studies, and textual evidence from key documents. Conference abstracts, research protocols, and systematic reviews will also be examined. All cultures, geographical contexts, races, and therapeutic settings will be considered. While sub-group analyses (eg, cultural or geographical variations) will not be conducted quantitatively due to the scoping nature of this review, relevant sub-group differences will be explored. METHODS: This review will follow the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Published and unpublished articles in English and Japanese from database inception to the present will be searched for in PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), CINAHL, PsycINFO, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, MedNar, and Google Scholar. Two reviewers will screen papers against predetermined inclusion criteria and extract data for specific variables. Data will be presented as tables and figures, accompanied by a narrative summary."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is particularly prevalent yet highly understudied and undertreated in adolescence. This study evaluates the efficacy of an internet-based, therapist-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adolescents and young adults with BDD compared to supportive online therapy as an active control condition. METHODS: In a single-blind, randomized controlled trial, N = 45 adolescents (aged 15-21 years) of all genders from German-speaking countries were assigned to 12 sessions of internet-based CBT (iCBT) or 12 weeks of supportive online therapy. The primary outcome was change in expert-rated BDD symptom severity from pre- to post-intervention (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified for Body Dysmorphic Disorder, BDD-YBOCS). Secondary outcomes included the remission and responder rate, changes in delusionality of appearance beliefs (BABS), self-rated BDD symptom severity (FKS), BDD cognitions (FKDK), quality of life (KINDL-R), and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) from pre to post and to a 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: iCBT was more efficient than supportive online therapy on the BDD-YBOCS (p =.002), with a large between-group effect size at post-intervention (Hedges' g (SE) = 0.93 (0.42)), and on all secondary measures (p <.05), except for depressive symptoms (p =.068). All secondary outcome measures also showed significant improvements from pre to post iCBT, with moderate to large effect sizes, and gains were stable until the 4-week follow-up period. iCBT participants showed higher remission (61.5%) and responder rates (66.7%), compared to controls (0% and 26.7%), but only the difference in remission reached significance. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the efficacy of internet-based CBT in comparison to an active control condition, thus contributing to the limited intervention research in adolescent BDD and adding a much-needed treatment option. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was pre-registered on 2020/06/08 at the German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00022055.",

Mindfulness has shown promise in enhancing treatment outcomes and preventing relapse in these conditions, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. METHODS: This study examined the role of emotion regulation as a mediator in the relationship between changes in mindfulness and the reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms during individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We tracked longitudinal changes in mindfulness, emotion regulation, depression, and anxiety at baseline (pre), early treatment (session 5), midtreatment (session 15), and posttreatment (session 25) in 162 patients with depression and anxiety disorders. Further, we examined whether the effects of mindfulness on emotion regulation could be enhanced by introducing a brief mindfulness intervention at the beginning of each CBT session, as compared to progressive muscle relaxation and individual psychotherapy without any standardized session-introducing interventions. RESULTS: Multilevel structural equation modeling indicated that decreases in rumination and increases in reappraisal and acceptance mediated the relationship between mindfulness and reductions in depressive symptoms. In contrast, reductions in avoidance explained the association between mindfulness and changes in anxiety symptoms. These links remained unchanged when adding a mindfulness intervention into individual CBT. CONCLUSION: Results support emotion regulatory properties of mindfulness and highlight distinct pathways of symptom reduction in depression and anxiety. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of mindfulness and tailoring treatment to individual patient needs. This trial is registered with NTC02270073.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia is often accompanied by depression and anxiety, which can seriously affect people's quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment, but the existing CBT-I ignores the intervention for anxiety-depressive symptoms, and has poor efficacy due to the lack of artificial support, poor compliance, the inability to spread widely and high dropping rate. A balance is needed between the convenience and efficiency of web-based technology and patient needs. Again in this context, an online WeChat applet (Smart CBT-I plus) will be developed with CBT-I technology as the core, integrating cognitive behavioral intervention modules for depression and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: This study will validate the effectiveness and applicability of Smart CBT-I plus by examining whether the Smart CBT-I plus study group will significantly reduce the distress of people suffering from insomnia with anxiety and/or depression symptoms compared to the psychoeducational group. METHODS: In this parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, 180 patients seeking help for insomnia combined with anxiety and/or depression will be recruited, and they will be randomized with 60 patients being assigned to the psychoeducation group (control group), and 120 patients being assigned to the Smart CBT-I plus group (study group). Measurements will be taken at baseline, post-intervention, 6 and 12 month follow-up, at the same time, semi-structured qualitative interviews about the experience of using Smart CBT-I plus will be conducted with randomly selected patients from the study group. RESULTS: The results will involve insomnia, depression and anxiety to explore its effectiveness, in-treatment dropout rates and subjective patient feedback to explore the applicability of Smart CBT-I plus. FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS: Self-help platforms need to be more individually designed to reach a wider audience. Research aimed at a wider audience, such as the general public, will make the research more universal and the platform more meaningful."

However, there are few apps developed to support specific evidence-based treatment for PTSD for adolescents.Objective: This paper shares experiences developing an app to complement Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). It also describes adolescents' and therapists' perceived usefulness and the potential effect of the app 'My everyday life' on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS).Methods: We did a needs assessment with adolescents, therapists, and TF-CBT trainers, followed by programming and beta-testing. We carried out a mixed methods study of 59 adolescent patients (aged 13-18 years) and their therapists. Using a triangulation design, we combined quantitative data on app use and changes in PTSS with qualitative data from interviews with 10 adolescents and 10 therapists who described their experiences with the app.Results: The app includes psychoeducation, mental health self-monitoring, coping tools, and goal-setting functionality. The most used features were psychoeducation and breathing exercises. Few therapists actively used the monitoring progress feature. Both adolescents and therapists found the app beneficial for everyday use, though some therapists were unsure about how to integrate it with TF-CBT. Adolescents reported significant PTSS improvement during TF-CBT with the app as a complement. Adolescents with post-treatment data (n = 13) did not report significantly different PTSD improvement compared to adolescents without access to app, but the study lacked power to draw strong conclusions.Conclusions: The app 'My everyday life' can be useful for adolescents receiving TF-CBT. The therapists may benefit from clearer guidelines on how to integrate apps with evidence-based treatments. Digital tools are a promising avenue for supporting the implementation of evidence-based treatment.",

This study examined SFA in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), testing the hypothesis that SFA is associated with hyperactivity within default network (DN) regions and with treatment response during cognitive-behavioral therapy. Participants included 30 patients with primary SAD or BDD and 28 healthy controls, who displayed above average and below average scores (respectively) on the Public Self-Consciousness Scale, which measured trait SFA. SFA was also measured by a self-referential encoding task, which yielded both behavioral reaction time measures and task-related fMRI measures of SFA. Results indicated significantly longer reaction times at pre-treatment for self vs. other trials in patients compared to controls, with patients showing notable improvement post-treatment. Neuroimaging revealed greater activation in DN regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, during self vs. other trials in all participants; however, there were no significant group differences at pre- or post-treatment, nor in the changes from pre- to post-treatment. Neural measures of SFA were significantly associated with treatment response, whereas behavioral measures were not. These findings suggest that activity in DN regions may serve as a transdiagnostic biomarker of maladaptive SFA that is associated with treatment response."

Online cognitive behavioral therapy is considered to be a promising treatment; however, whether it is effective at improving postpartum depression is inconsistent and the specific intervention measures are not the same. The objectives of this study were to comprehensively review the effects of online cognitive behavioral therapy on postpartum depression and further explore the specific intervention measures. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using thirteen electronic databases and two clinical trial registries from the establishment of the databases to 31 December 2023. The study selection and data extraction were independently performed by two researchers. The latest Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was selected to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4, and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the online GRADEpro tool. Eighteen studies involving 3689 women were included. RESULTS: The results showed that online cognitive behavioral therapy was effective at improving postpartum depression. A subgroup analysis showed that the duration of online cognitive behavioral therapy with total intervention was 9 weeks and above, the total intervention number was 12 times or fewer, and using a website or Zoom online conference room as the intervention platform could more significantly improve postpartum depression. In particular, providing professional guidance could be more effective. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, online cognitive behavioral therapy was effective for postpartum depression. Furthermore, this study found out how specific intervention measures of online cognitive behavioral therapy could be more effective. Finally, nurses can participate in the therapy to improve access to evidence-based treatment."

Insomnia significantly impairs cognitive functioning, overall health, and quality of life. Although traditional CBT has demonstrated efficacy, its scalability and ability to deliver individualized care remain limited. Emerging AI-driven interventions-including chatbots, mobile applications, and web-based platforms-present innovative avenues for delivering more accessible and personalized insomnia treatments. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, this review synthesized findings from 78 studies published between 2004 and 2024. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Studies were included based on predefined criteria prioritizing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and high-quality empirical research that evaluated AI-augmented CBT interventions targeting sleep disorders, particularly insomnia. Results: The findings suggest that digital and AI-enhanced CBT significantly improves sleep parameters, patient adherence, satisfaction, and the personalization of therapy in alignment with individual neurocognitive profiles. Moreover, these technologies address critical limitations of conventional CBT, notably those related to access and scalability. AI-based tools appear especially promising in optimizing treatment delivery and adapting interventions to cognitive-behavioral patterns. Conclusions: While AI-enhanced CBT demonstrates strong potential for advancing insomnia treatment through neurocognitive personalization and broader clinical accessibility, several challenges persist. These include uncertainties surrounding long-term efficacy, practical implementation barriers, and ethical considerations. Future large-scale longitudinal research is necessary to confirm the sustained neurocognitive and behavioral benefits of digital and AI-powered CBT for insomnia."

Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer a promising way to deliver accessible cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions. However, research on the usability and effectiveness of apps explicitly tailored for adolescents is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the usability, engagement, and perceived effectiveness of a mobile CBT app designed for adolescents, focusing on user experiences and mental health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with 40 adolescents aged 13-19 years (mean age 15.8, SD 1.9 years; 18/40, 45% male; 22/40, 55% female) who engaged with a CBT app for 4 weeks. Mental health diagnoses included anxiety (20/40, 50%), depression (15/40, 38%), and both (5/40, 13%). Of these, 10 (25%) of the 40 participants had previous CBT experience. Feedback was gathered through focus groups and individual interviews, and thematic analysis identified key themes related to usability, engagement, and perceived effectiveness. Quantitative data on mood and anxiety scores were analyzed with paired t tests. RESULTS: The mean usability score was 3.8 (SD 0.6), and the mean effectiveness score was 3.9 (SD 0.7). Older participants (aged 16-19 years) reported significantly higher usability (mean 4.1, SD 0.4) and effectiveness scores (mean 4.3, SD 0.5) compared to younger participants (aged 13-15 years) (P=.03). Females had higher usability (mean 4, SD 0.6) and effectiveness scores (mean 4.2, SD 0.7) than males (mean 3.6, SD 0.7, and mean 3.5, SD 0.8, respectively; P=.03). Participants with prior CBT experience had 2.8 times higher odds of reporting high usability scores (95% CI 1.6-5; P=.002) and 3.1 times higher odds of reporting high effectiveness scores (95% CI 1.7-5.6; P=.001). Usability challenges included complex navigation (20/40, 50%), interface design issues (12/40, 30%), and content overload (8/40, 20%). Factors positively influencing engagement were motivation driven by personal relevance (20/40, 50%) and gamification features (10/40, 25%), while lack of personalization (14/40, 35%) and external distractions (18/40, 45%) were significant barriers. Mood improvement (15/40, 38%) and learning new coping skills (12/40, 30%) were the most reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile CBT app shows potential for improving adolescent mental health, with initial improvements in mood and anxiety. Future app iterations should prioritize simplifying navigation, adding personalization features, and enhancing technical stability to support long-term engagement."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this semi-experimental pretest-posttest study, T1D patients enrolled in two experimental groups: unified protocols for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders and modular cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions in a unified process and one control group. After the completion of the therapeutic sessions, all three groups responded to the research questionnaires in the post-test phase and after a two-month follow-up and were compared. RESULTS: The results of the repeated measures analysis of variance showed that the unified protocols for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders and modular cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions had a significant effect on increasing positive affect and emotional awareness, as well as reducing negative affect in children with T1D, and the effects of the treatment remained during the follow-up stage (P < 0.001). A comparison between the two treatments also indicated that the modular cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention had a greater effectiveness in reducing the negative affect variable in the post-test phase compared to the unified protocols for transdiagnostic treatment (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between the two therapeutic methods in other variables (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, both interventions can be used as useful treatments to improve psychological variables in children with T1D. These results underscore its potential as a potent tool for enhancing the emotional well-being of individuals with this condition, thereby contributing to an improved quality of life."

This study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the following 4 imagery techniques in targeting mental imagery and AVHs severity: Imagery Rescripting (ImRs), Promoting positive Imagery de novo (Pos-Im), Metacognitive Imagery techniques (Meta-Im), and playing Tetris. STUDY DESIGN: Four replicated single-case series experimental designs were used. Participants were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatment conditions. Primary, we measured the severity of mental imagery and AVHs thrice daily on an 11-point VAS scale during a 2-week baseline, throughout 3 weeks of therapy, and during a 2-week follow-up phase. Randomization tests were used to examine whether daily severity levels of momentary mental imagery and AVHs decreased post-therapy. Secondary, questionnaires assessing the severity of AVHs, mental imagery characteristics, and levels of mood, anxiety, and functioning were administered at baseline, before, and posttreatment. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants completed all treatment sessions. Mental imagery significantly decreased after ImRs (P < .001, d = 1.13) and Pos-Im (P = .039, d = 0.22), with no significant effects observed following Meta-Im or Tetris. AVHs significantly decreased with all treatment conditions, with largest effects for ImRs (P = .001, d = 1.39) and Pos-Im (P < .001, d = 1.99). Secondary results demonstrated reductions in the severity of AVHs, mood, anxiety, imagery frequency, and appraisals. CONCLUSIONS: Imagery techniques appear feasible and acceptable for addressing mental imagery and AVHs in the psychosis continuum and may be valuable additions to current treatment for AVHs."

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: CBT-CP is a core evidence-based practice that is central to multidisciplinary chronic pain care. However, research suggests that CBT-CP is underused. The current study used national Veterans Health Administration data to examine the use of CBT-CP by CBT-CP-trained therapists to treat patients with pain over a five-year period. STUDY DESIGN: Multilevel modeling was used to evaluate clinic, therapist, and patient-level factors as predictors of CBT-CP receipt. DATA COLLECTION: Administrative data on 37,514 patients seen at a national sample of Veterans Health Administration locations for pain were collected from the U.S. Veterans Health Administration central data repository. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Results indicated 38.4% of patients with pain seen by a CBT-CP-trained therapist received CBT-CP during the observation period. Patients were more likely to receive CBT-CP if more time elapsed since their therapist received CBT-CP training and if their therapist had a master's degree (vs. a doctorate). Patients with somatic symptom disorder and depressive disorders were more likely to receive CBT-CP, while patients with comorbid personality disorders or substance use disorders were less likely to receive CBT-CP. Patients seen in pain specialty, PTSD, biomedical, and mental health clinics were more likely to receive CBT-CP than those not seen in these clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the reach of CBT-CP is substantively related to factors at each level. Future research is needed to better understand the therapy treatment decision-making processes and to address education gaps and other factors that impede the implementation of evidence-based practices."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep difficulties are common for people with advanced cancer and are associated with poorer mood, lower quality of life, and reduced survival. For these patients, insomnia severity ratings are tied to nighttime awakenings, but little is known about the reasons for awakenings. AIMS: This study reports actigraphy sleep outcomes, longitudinal self-reported insomnia severity, and circadian rhythm disruptions from a randomized pilot study comparing a multi-symptom intervention with a wait-list control group for people with advanced cancer. METHODS: Twenty-eight people with advanced cancer completed a brief intervention, Finding Our Center Under Stress (FOCUS), designed to enhance sleep and alleviate worry, depression, and fatigue. Participants completed questionnaires and wore an Actiwatch for 7 consecutive 24-h periods pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant group × time actigraphy effects. However, sensitivity analyses with the full intervention sample including the wait-list control arm demonstrated significant effects on actigraphy sleep efficiency, minutes awake after sleep onset (WASO), number of awakenings, naps, and activity at rest. Insomnia severity ratings on the Insomnia Severity Index were maintained longitudinally with 61% meeting the cut-off for insomnia at baseline compared to 18% at 1 year. Participants demonstrated reductions in key reasons for awakenings. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-symptom interventions may be necessary for sustained insomnia improvements for people with advanced cancer. The FOCUS intervention is one of the first to demonstrate improvements on self-reported and actigraphic measures of sleep in addition to other symptoms (i.e., worry, uncertainty, depression, fatigue interference, distress) for this population. Future effectiveness studies are warranted given results of this pilot trial.

The pilot trial involved 53 PTSD patients (46 males and 7 females, mean age 48.2±8.3 years) with COMISA randomized to combination therapy of BBTI plus 2 weeks of eszopiclone (2 mg/d) or BBTI alone with follow-up visits conducted at 6 and 24 weeks. The main outcome measure was sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A significant decrease in PSQI scores was observed between baseline and 24 weeks for BBTI plus ESZ (-5.24 [95% CI, -6.55 to -3.94]; p < 0.001) and BBTI-only (-5.45 [95%CI, -6.75 to -4.14]; p < 0.001). No significant group allocation effects x time interactions were detected. Similar improvements were recorded for ISI between baseline and 24 weeks (BBTI plus ESZ (-8.32 [95%CI, -10.51 to -6.14]; p < 0.001) and BBTI-only (-8.64 [95%CI, -10.88 to -6.41]; p < 0.001)) with no interaction effect between treatment groups x time. Combination therapy produced a higher remission rate of insomnia at 6 weeks, with both interventions achieving comparable rates at 24 weeks. Results of the mixed effect models for CPAP use revealed no group x time interaction effects. In patients with COMISA, the combination of eszopiclone with BBTI resulted in comparable improvement in sleep quality of life to that achieved with BBTI-only therapy. Although the addition of eszopiclone to BBTI conferred an early benefit in remission rate of insomnia relative to BBTI, both modalities achieved similar outcomes at long-term follow-up.

The World Health Organization's Thinking Healthy Programme (WHO-THP) is an established 'task-shared' cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for perinatal depression. However, efforts to scale up are hampered by overburdened health systems struggling to maintain quality and fidelity. Here, to overcome these challenges, we coproduced with end users a technology-assisted digital version of the THP delivered by lived-experience peers (technology-assisted peer-delivered THP (THP-TAP)). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of THP-TAP compared to the established WHO-THP. A single-blind cluster-randomized controlled noninferiority trial was conducted in rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with 70 village clusters randomly distributed to the two interventions. From June 2022 to May 2023, we recruited 980 women with perinatal depression registered with primary healthcare centers. The primary outcome was remission from the depressive episode at 3 months postnatal. On assessment of 846/980 (86.3%) participants at 3 months postnatal, the difference in the remission rate was 8.91% with the lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval being 4.25%, larger than the prespecified -10% noninferiority margin (Pnoninferiority < 0.0001). In settings where health systems are weak and overburdened, THP-TAP offers an effective and potentially scalable alternative to the delivery of psychosocial interventions.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions may help increase access to psychological treatment for adolescents with anxiety disorders. However, many clinical evaluations of digital treatments report low adherence and engagement and high dropout rates, which remain challenges when the interventions are implemented in routine care. Involving intended end users in the development process through user-centered design methods may help maximize user engagement and establish the validity of interventions for implementation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the methods used to develop a new internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention, CoolMinds, within a user-centered design framework. METHODS: The development of intervention content progressed in three iterative design phases: (1) identifying needs and design specifications, (2) designing and testing prototypes, and (3) running feasibility tests with end users. In phase 1, a total of 24 adolescents participated in a user involvement workshop exploring their preferences on graphic identity and communication styles as well as their help-seeking behavior. In phase 2, a total of 4 adolescents attended individual usability tests in which they were presented with a prototype of a psychoeducational session and asked to think aloud about their actions on the platform. In phase 3, a total of 7 families from the feasibility trial participated in a semistructured interview about their satisfaction with and initial impressions of the platform and intervention content while in treatment. Activities in all 3 phases were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded using thematic analysis and qualitative description design. The intervention was continuously revised after each phase based on the feedback. RESULTS: In phase 1, adolescent feedback guided the look and feel of the intervention content (ie, color scheme, animation style, and communication style). Participants generally liked content that was relatable and age appropriate and felt motivating. Animations that resembled \"humans\" received more votes as adolescents could better \"identify\" themselves with them. Communication should preferably be \"supportive\" and feel \"like a friend\" talking to them. Statements including praise-such as \"You're well on your way. How are you today?\"-received the most votes (12 votes), whereas directive statements such as \"Tell us how your day has been?\" and \"How is practicing your steps going?\" received the least votes (2 and 0 votes, respectively). In phase 2, adolescents perceived the platform as intuitive and easy to navigate and the session content as easy to understand but lengthy. In phase 3, families were generally satisfied with the intervention content, emphasizing the helpfulness of graphic material to understand therapeutic content. Their feedback helped identify areas for further improvement, such as editing down the material and including more in-session breaks. CONCLUSIONS: Using user involvement practices in the development of interventions helps ensure continued alignment of the intervention with end-user needs and may help establish the validity of the intervention for implementation in routine care practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Publicly-insured and uninsured individuals-many of whom are marginalized because of race/ethnicity, ability status, and/or other social identities-experience barriers to accessing evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for eating disorders (EDs). Additionally, EBIs have not been developed with or for diverse populations, exacerbating poor treatment uptake. Mobile technology is well-positioned to bridge this gap and increase access to low-cost, culturally-sensitive EBIs. METHODS: This study leverages a user-centered design approach to adapt an existing coached cognitive-behavioral therapy-based digital program and evaluate its usability in a sample of 11 participants with (sub)clinical binge type EDs who are publicly-insured (n = 10) or uninsured (n = 1). Participants were primarily non-Latinx White women (n = 8). Two semi-structured interviews occurred with participants: one to assess treatment needs and the other to obtain program-specific feedback. Interviews were coded using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Interview 1 feedback converged on three themes: Recovery Journey, Treatment Experiences, and Engagement with and Expectations for Online Programs. Participants endorsed facing barriers to healthcare, such as poor insurance coverage and a lack of trained providers, and interest in a coach to increase treatment accountability. Interview 2 feedback converged on three themes: Content Development, Participant Experiences with Mental Health, and Real-World Use. Participants liked the content but emphasized the need to improve diverse representation (e.g., gender, body size). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, user feedback is critical to informing adaptations to the original EBI so that the intervention can be appropriately tailored to the needs of this underserved population, which ultimately has high potential to address critical barriers to ED treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University California, San Francisco (IRB #22-35936) and the IRB at Washington University in St. Louis (IRB ID 202304167).",

A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that cognitive and behavioral therapy tailored for post-ABI sleep and fatigue (CBT-SF) produced larger and faster effects compared to an active health education (HE) control intervention. The current study aimed to qualitatively explore the perspectives of the six clinicians, all clinical neuropsychologists, who delivered the CBT-SF and HE interventions to 126 individuals with ABI in the RCT. One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted, and transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Seven themes were generated, encompassing client-related factors (Client Awareness and Readiness as Precursors to Engagement and Navigating Client Differences Throughout Treatment) and clinician-related factors that influenced treatment delivery (Building on Pre-Existing Expertise and Strengths and Challenges of Delivering a Manualized Intervention), as well as other themes directly related to treatment delivery itself (Challenges and Successes Relating to Client Engagement, CBT Strategies That Work, and Navigating Practical Considerations in Treatment Delivery). The findings reinforce the value of psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral strategies for managing sleep and fatigue problems after ABI. They also provide valuable insights to guide the translation of CBT-SF from an RCT to real-world clinical practice."

Participants included English-fluent adults (21 years or older), without prior MBT or CBT training, and with moderate-to-severe CLBP (average score ≥3 on the Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]; functional limitation score ≥20 on the Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), treated with an opioid dosage of at least 15 mg/d of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for at least 3 months. Outcome data were collected from July 1, 2017, to November 23, 2022. Analysis used the intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTIONS: Manual-based MBT or CBT interventions consisting of 8 weekly therapist-led group sessions and at-home practice. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported coprimary (average pain severity, 0-10 [BPI]; functional limitations, 0-100 [ODI]) and secondary (mental and physical health-related quality of life [QOL] on the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Health Survey and opioid dose in MME per day, Timeline Followback) outcomes compared at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Among 6024 screened individuals, 2926 were ineligible, 2328 were eligible, and 770 were enrolled, including 385 in the MBT and 385 in the CBT groups. Of these, 434 participants (56.4%) were female, 647 (84.0%) identified as non-Hispanic ethnicity, and 630 (81.8%) identified as White race; mean (SD) age was 57.8 (11.3) years. The mean (SD) BPI average pain score was 6.1 (1.6) (moderate pain) and the mean (SD) ODI functional limitation score was 47.2 (14.0) (moderate functional limitations), with reduced physical (mean [SD], 28.5 [8.3]) and mental (mean [SD], 42.5 [11.8]) health-related QOL on the SF-12 and high opioid dosage (mean [SD], 177 [1041] MME/d). Over time, each group significantly improved their outcomes, without serious adverse effects. The intention-to-treat linear mixed-effects model analysis did not detect significant between-group differences at 6 and 12 months for pain (0.21 [95% CI, -0.05 to 0.48; P = .12] and 0.13 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.40; P = .33], respectively) or function (0.07 [95% CI, -1.80 to 1.93; P = .94], and 0.27 [95% CI, -1.59 to 2.12; P = .78], respectively) and indicated MBT's noninferiority relative to CBT on primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large trial, CLBP-related symptoms improved, while opioid dosage decreased in both MBT and CBT groups at 6 and 12 months. Increasing availability of these safe psychological therapies could help reduce individual and societal burdens of refractory, opioid-treated CLBP.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although patients prefer describing their problems using words, mental health interventions are commonly evaluated using rating scales. Fortunately, recent advances in natural language processing (i.e., AI-methods) yield new opportunities to quantify people's own mental health descriptions. Our aim was to explore whether responses to open-ended questions, quantified using AI, provide additional value in measuring intervention outcomes compared to traditional rating scales. METHOD: Swedish adolescents (N = 44) who received Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) for eight weeks completed (pre/post) scales measuring anxiety and depression and three open-ended questions (related to depression, anxiety and general mental health). The language responses were quantified using a large language model and quantitative methods to predict mental health as measured by rating scales, valence (i.e., words' positive/negative affectivity), and semantic content (i.e., meaning). RESULTS: Similar to the rating scales, language measures revealed statistically significant health improvements between pre and post measures such as reduced depression and anxiety symptoms and an increase in the use of words conveying positive emotions and different meanings (e.g., pre-intervention: \"anxious\", depressed; post-intervention: \"happy\", \"the future\"). Notably, the health changes identified through semantic content measures remained statistically significant even after accounting for the changes captured by the rating scales. CONCLUSION: Language responses analyzed using AI-methods assessed outcomes with fewer items, demonstrating effectiveness and accuracy comparable to traditional rating scales. Additionally, this approach provided valuable insights into patients' well-being beyond mere symptom reduction, thus highlighting areas of improvement that rating scales often overlook. Since patients often prefer using natural language to express their mental health, this method could complement, and address comprehension issues associated fixed-item questionnaires."

METHODS: A total of 42 women were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 21) or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) (n = 21). All participants completed a battery of assessments for pain, emotional distress, hope, equanimity, and post-traumatic growth before and after the intervention, as well as at the 2-month follow-up. The intervention consisted of a short (4-week) MiCBT program, which involved progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness of breath, body scanning, and the mindfulness-based interoceptive exposure task (MIET) for pain. The program was conducted over four consecutive weeks. RESULTS: Compared with the TAU group, at post-treatment, the MiCBT group experienced larger and significant reductions in pain (d = 1.58), psychological distress (d = .99), depression (d = 1.59), anxiety (d = 1.13), and stress (d = 1.68), as well as improvements in equanimity (d = 1.61), hope (d = 1.06), and post-traumatic growth (d = .6) (p's < .5). These differences remained significant at 2-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that a four-week MiCBT intervention can improve the daily experiences of women with BC undergoing chemotherapy. Further research using larger samples and active control is needed to determine the generalizability of the results."

Inappropriate application can result in prolonged hospital visits and increased medical costs. Therefore, identifying an objective biomarker for evaluating suitability is crucial. This study focused on electroencephalogram (EEG) complexity as a potential biomarker for evaluating CBT suitability for chronic LBP, assessing its discriminative ability and identifying factors that impede treatment. Complexity was analyzed as multiscale fuzzy sample entropy (MFSE). Fifty patients with suspected psychosocial factors causing LBP along with 20 healthy volunteers were included. The analysis included 25 responders and 25 non-responders for CBT. MFSE showed significant effects of scale factor [F(19,171) = 14.82, p < 0.01, partial η2 = 0.622] and interaction between group and scale factor [F(38,171) = 7.34, p < 0.01, partial η2 = 0.620]. The low-frequency band MFSE score had an odds ratio of 10.768 (95% confidence interval: 8.263-10.044, p < 0.001). The low-frequency band showed a high discriminative ability (area under the curve: 0.825), with a cut-off value of 1.25. The low-frequency FMSE is a superior biomarker for predicting suitability for CBT. This method can quickly evaluate suitability, reducing the burden on medical professionals and patients, and lowering medical costs.",

METHODS: A secondary analysis of the multicenter, randomized controlled trial \"CBTlate\" was conducted with n = 229 participants aged 60 years and older with moderate to severe depression who received either LLD-CBT (n = 115) or SUI (n = 114). Depressive symptoms as outcome were assessed with the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Educational attainment was categorized according to the school and vocational education based system (CASMIN). Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using multilevel mixed effects linear models. RESULTS: While the model showed no significant overall effect of education on treatment outcome, analysis revealed a significant treatment effect for the low educational attainment group (group*time interaction, x2(2) = 6.45, p = .040) with LLD-CBT being superior to SUI in the reduction of depressive symptoms from baseline to the end of treatment (Estimated Marginal Mean Difference (EMMD) = -5.30, 95 %-CI = -8.93 to -2.12) and to follow-up (EMMD = -7.34, 95 %-CI = -11.24 to -3.43). There was no corresponding significant effect for the medium and high educational group. In the low remission and response rates were significantly higher in the LLD-CBT compared to the SUI group at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Participants may have responded differently to LLD-CBT and SUI depending on their previous school and vocational education. This may be taken into account for future research and potentially when treating patients with LLD and individualizing interventions for this patient group.",

Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia is the first-line treatment, limited accessibility leaves many older adults with few effective treatment options. This study assessed the efficacy of digital CBT (dCBT) for treating insomnia, anxiety, and depression symptoms in adults aged 65 and older. METHOD: Data from three published randomized controlled trials of dCBT for insomnia (Sleepio) versus controls were combined for those aged 65+ with insomnia disorder (N = 315). Insomnia, anxiety, and depression scores were standardized into z-scores for comparison. Mixed-effects models estimated the treatment effect on insomnia, depression, and anxiety outcomes at post-treatment (8-10 wk) and follow-up (24 wk). Chi-squared tests of Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI-8) scores evaluated post-treatment insomnia remission rates between groups. RESULTS: Compared with controls, dCBT generated significantly greater improvements at post-treatment and follow-up in insomnia (gs ≤ -1.88, ps < 0.001) and depression (gs ≤ -0.44, ps ≤ 0.001) and significantly greater improvements in anxiety at post-treatment (g = -0.33, p < 0.001). dCBT generated higher post-treatment insomnia remission rates (60% vs. 16%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: dCBT can effectively improve symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression in adults aged 65+. Digital CBT may serve as an accessible means for older adults to receive guideline-concordant treatment at scale and avoid adverse side effects from common pharmacologic interventions."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 84,739 Veterans, using national Veterans Health Administration data, to evaluate the association between CBT-I completion and incident cognitive impairment among older Veterans. Veterans were classified as administration of Any CBT-I versus Referral only using electronic documented notes. Incident cognitive impairment was defined by dementia-related diagnosis codes or an associated medication prescription. Among Veterans not using sedative-hypnotics, there was a decreased incidence of cognitive impairment for Veterans completing Any CBT-I compared to Referral only, RR= 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80-0.98). Yet, for Veterans taking sedative-hypnotic medications, there was an increased incidence of cognitive impairment between groups, RR= 1.18 (95% CI: 1.07-1.30). CBT-I may offer a protective effect from incident cognitive impairment; however, the presence of sedative-hypnotics reverses this trend."

METHOD: A systematic search was conducted on the PUBMED database for the last ten years, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, following PICOS criteria, and applying specific queries in the 'PubMed Advanced Search Builder'. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were selected and included in the systematic review, with a total number of 2498 patients enrolled, excluding patient samples analysed multiple times, with results published in different papers. The mean/SD age of the enrolled patients was 56.9±7.7 years (range: 30.3-63.0). The mean/SD number of scales used was 4.2±2.0 (range: 2-9). The psychological intervention included CBT in 8/21 (38.1%) studies, Internet-Delivered CBT (I-CBT) in 8/21 (38.1%), and CBT + Activity in 1/21 (4.8%) Monitor (AM), 1/21 (4.8%) Stress Management CBT-based, 1/21 (4.8%) CBT-WBT Sequential Approach, 1/21 (4.8%) e-IMPACT CBT (CBT delivered via internet o' by phone'), 1/21 (4.8%) Group-CBT. The control groups underwent 'treatment as usual' (TAU) in 5/21 (23.8%) studies, 'online discussion forum' (ODF) in 5/21 (23.8%) studies, 'clinical management' (CM) in 4/21 (19.0%) studies, pharmacological treatment with SSRIs (2/21; 9.5%), 'waiting list condition' (WLC), 'educational support' or 'simple monitoring' in the remaining 4/21 (19.0%) studies; in one study (4.8%), this information was not available. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of CBT as a treatment for depressive syndromes in patients with CD is still under discussion, partly due to the heterogeneity of the outcome measures, partly due to methodological issues, such as therapist supervision and allegiance. CBT seems to be irrelevant to biological variables, such as inflammatory markers and heart rate variability and not ever superior to other interventions, in the treatment of depressive symptoms."

AIMS: We evaluated how natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) methods might automate the monitoring of coaches' implementation fidelity to GdCBT delivered as part of a randomized controlled trial. METHOD: Coaches served as guides to 6-month GdCBT with 3,381 assigned users with or at risk for anxiety, depression, or eating disorders. CBT-trained and supervised human coders used a rubric to rate the implementation fidelity of 13,529 coach-to-user messages. NLP methods abstracted data from text-based coach-to-user messages, and 11 ML models predicting coach implementation fidelity were evaluated. RESULTS: Inter-rater agreement by human coders was excellent (intra-class correlation coefficient = .980-.992). Coaches achieved behavioral targets at the start of the GdCBT and maintained strong fidelity throughout most subsequent messages. Coaches also avoided prohibited actions (e.g. reinforcing users' avoidance). Sentiment analyses generally indicated a higher frequency of coach-delivered positive than negative sentiment words and predicted coach implementation fidelity with acceptable performance metrics (e.g. area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 74.48%). The final best-performing ML algorithms that included a more comprehensive set of NLP features performed well (e.g. AUC = 76.06%). CONCLUSIONS: NLP and ML tools could help clinical supervisors automate monitoring of coaches' implementation fidelity to GdCBT. These tools could maximize allocation of scarce resources by reducing the personnel time needed to measure fidelity, potentially freeing up more time for high-quality clinical care.",

Evidence-based treatments, including cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder, should be disseminated to a broader segment of society. In our study, we developed a web-based cognitive behavioral psychoeducation program for panic disorder and evaluated its short-term effects in a clinical sample. The 4-week program was administered to 31 patients diagnosed with panic disorder, and related outcomes were assessed using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), Health Anxiety Inventory Short Version (SHAI), and Adult Separation Anxiety Questionnaire (ASA). We found a statistically significant decrease in PDSS scores with a large effect size (g = 2.26, 95% CI [1.60, 2.92]). Significant reductions were also observed in ASI-3 (g = 1.18 95% CI [0.62, 1.74]), SHAI (g = 0.57, 95% CI [0.05, 1.10], and ASA scores (g = 1.28, 95% CI [0.72, 1.85]), with medium to large effect sizes. These results suggest that the intervention had a substantial impact on reducing panic-related symptoms in the short term. This approach may be a cost-effective option clinicians can recommend to their patients, particularly in low-resource settings."

Our threshold for moving on to efficacy trials will be at least 70% of our participants to rate 3 and above (which corresponds to agree or strongly agree) that the intervention package was acceptable, feasible, and safe. The secondary aims will be assessed by observing whether individuals achieve self-directed modulation of high-β neurophysiological activity (neural target) and progression upwards through the VR-based exposure hierarchy (psychological target), and by assessing symptom change scores. This study developed a new treatment approach for auditory verbal hallucinations, a major symptom of psychotic disorders, that integrates advances in psychological therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis), technology (virtual reality, VR), and neuroscience (electroencephalography-based neurofeedback). METHODS: Hybrid takes a \"symptom capture\" approach using individually tailored VR-based exposure exercises. Participants (N=10) will receive the intervention package weekly over 12 face-to-face sessions. Here, participants will be progressively exposed to symptom triggers and develop methods of downregulating neural activity associated with these symptoms (neurofeedback component) while concurrently receiving clinician-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis. RESULTS: As of February 2025, Hybrid has commenced (unblinded) recruitment activities from Orygen clinical services in Northwestern Melbourne, Australia. A total of 75 individuals have been approached and 64 individuals have been prescreened (41 individuals were deemed eligible, 15 individuals were ineligible, and 8 individuals declined or did not respond to contact attempts) and 5 individuals have been included in the study. Of the 5 individuals who have commenced the Hybrid treatment, 4 are actively engaged in the program and 1 individual has withdrawn. We expect recruitment to conclude in July 2025 and for the results to be published in 2026. CONCLUSIONS: The Hybrid study is piloting a novel approach that has the potential to address the shortcomings of current treatments for psychotic symptoms. If there is favorable evidence for the acceptability, feasibility, safety and usability of Hybrid, the study team will move on to efficacy trials.

Transitioning through critical developmental phases, 39 students who had experienced significant loss and demonstrated symptoms of prolonged grief participated in this randomized controlled trial. They were divided equally into three groups: those receiving EH, those undergoing CBT, and a control group placed on a waiting list. Assessments utilized the Prolonged Grief Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory to measure the interventions' impact on grief. Findings revealed significant improvements in both EH and CBT groups compared to the control, with EH showing marginally higher effectiveness in reducing grief symptoms. This research underlines EH's potential as a culturally adaptable and effective treatment for prolonged grief in a diverse academic setting, advocating for its broader application and further exploration across various populations."

We aimed to: (a) evaluate the magnitude of behavioral and cognitive symptom reduction across treatment; and (b) investigate the relation between early behavioral change and subsequent cognitive change. We hypothesized: (a) large and significant reductions in behavioral and cognitive symptoms from pre- to mid-treatment and from pre- to post-treatment; and (b) that early behavioral change would predict subsequent cognitive change over the course of treatment. METHOD: Patients (N = 63) were offered CBT-T and completed the Eating Disorder-15 on a weekly basis. We used intent-to-treat analyses. For Aim 1, we conducted a series of fixed-effect multilevel models for each outcome variable, accounting for repeated measures (pre-, mid-, and post-treatment) within individuals. For Aim 2, we conducted a linear regression using early behavioral change as the predictor and subsequent cognitive change as the outcome. RESULTS: We observed large and significant reductions in most behavioral and all cognitive symptoms pre- to mid-treatment and pre- to post-treatment. Early changes in behavioral symptoms did not significantly predict subsequent cognitive changes. DISCUSSION: Behavioral improvements occurred rapidly and were sustained throughout treatment, whereas cognitive changes followed a more gradual trajectory. The absence of a significant predictive relationship between early behavioral change and subsequent cognitive change suggests that these domains may improve independently. Future research should investigate the mechanisms linking behavioral and cognitive changes."

The aims of this study were to quantitatively examine the immediate and longer term effects of participation in a group-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention called Mothers Time on (1) symptoms of depression and anxiety, (2) the use of a modern family planning method, and (3) intermediate FP-related factors among postpartum women in Ethiopia. Building from lessons learned during a feasibility study, we implemented a cluster randomized controlled design, with structured interviews delivered before (baseline), immediately following (endline), and fourxst months after implementation of the intervention (follow-up). A total of 302 postpartum women were recruited from 10 health clusters in northwest Ethiopia. In comparison to control clusters where participants received standard of care, intervention clusters showed significantly greater reductions in symptoms for both depression and anxiety from baseline to follow-up. Modern FP use also increased significantly more in intervention clusters as compared to control clusters from baseline to follow-up. Results suggest that more holistic FP services that consider postpartum mental health can both reduce postpartum depression and anxiety and support women in fulfilling their reproductive intentions.",

While treatments for PPD that include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may adaptively alter infant ER immediately following treatment, it is unclear if these improvements persist. METHODS: This study examined if adaptive changes in infant ER persisted three months after their birthing parent completed 9-weeks of CBT for PPD. We used data from n = 35 case infants (of birthing parents diagnosed with a postpartum major depressive disorder), and n = 33 healthy control infants (born to non-depressed birthing parents and matched to case infants on age, sex and family SES). A multimethod assessment of infant ER included resting-state frontal EEG asymmetry (FA), high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), and birthing parent- and partner-reported temperamental positive affect (PA). Infant ER was examined at three study visits (V1 occurred before CBT/at baseline for control infants, V2 took place immediately after CBT (9-weeks later), and V3 was three months after V2). RESULTS: Three months after birthing parent CBT (V3), infants continued to exhibit greater left FA relative to pre-treatment [∆meanV1 to V3 = 0.19, [SE = 0.082], p = 0.02]-the pre-to-post treatment shift from right to left FA remained statistically significant at V3). HF-HRV at V3 also increased relative to pre-treatment [∆mV1 to V3 = 0.81, [0.19], p < 0.001], as did PA reported by birthing parents [∆mV1 to V3 = 0.64, [0.16], p < 0.001] and their partners [∆mV1 to V3 = 0.54, [0.18], p = 0.004]. No ER measures differed between case and control infants at the three-month visit. CONCLUSIONS: Treating PPD may set infants on a persistent adaptive ER trajectory."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia can be caused by various factors including lack of sleep, stress, sadness, hormonal changes, excessive caffeine, anxiety, mental health disorders, and medications. Treatments include finding the cause, improving sleep patterns, using behavioral therapy, and taking sleeping pills in most cases. However, the drugs often cause worse side effects than insomnia. This study compared the efficacy of initial agomelatine and clonazepam doses with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) in moderate to severe insomnia patients. METHODS: This quasi-experiment study involved 230 moderate to severe insomnia patients with group A as clonazepam 0.25 mg and B as agomelatine 25 mg. CBT-i was received by both of the groups and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) score, medication adherence, and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) were followed for up to 24 weeks. RESULTS: In the comparative analysis between and within groups, group B exhibited a significant reduction in ISI (p = 0.001) and SUDS (p = 0.001) scores at week 24 compared to group A. Overall, both groups demonstrated improved adherence. However, 12 patients in group A and 10 in group B experienced ADR, which included drowsiness, hypersalivation, diarrhea, maculopapular rash, and myotoxicity. The clonazepam-treated group showed reduced efficacy from week 12 onwards in the ISI and from week 16 in the SUDS median score, which was not observed in the agomelatine group. CONCLUSION: The initial dose of agomelatine with CBT-i has a better impact on improving moderate to severe insomnia than the initial dose of clonazepam with CBT-i.",

DESIGN: Participants took part in a parent randomized controlled trial comparing an 8-week CBT-SF program with a health education control, face-to-face or via videoconferencing, and adapted for cognitive impairments. They were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, 2 months posttreatment, and 4 months posttreatment. A secondary analysis was conducted to identify which demographic, injury-related, neuropsychological, and pretreatment variables, as well as mode of treatment delivery, were associated with response to CBT-SF. SETTING: Community dwelling. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six participants (N=86) with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke who received CBT-SF in a parent randomized controlled trial. INTERVENTIONS: CBT-SF. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Fatigue Severity Scale. RESULTS: Greater improvements in sleep after CBT-SF were associated with higher baseline sleep disturbance, less time since injury, and telehealth mode of delivery. Larger reductions in fatigue were associated with less time since injury and higher education. Injury type (TBI and stroke) and cognitive variables were not associated with treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight that an adapted CBT-SF intervention can be equally effective for individuals with TBI and stroke; however, gains are greater earlier after injury. Although individuals with severe symptoms at baseline show the greatest benefit, the intervention can be effective across a range of symptom presentations."

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are common mental health conditions characterized by excessive fear and anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy, yet the possible neurobiological mechanisms underpinning its effects remain debated. The dual-route model offers a potential explanation by suggesting that CBT increases activation in the brain areas responsible for emotion regulation while decreasing activation in limbic areas. This scoping review examined possible neurobiological mechanisms supporting CBT's efficacy in anxiety disorders by exclusively reviewing studies that utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The included studies published since 2018 focused on adult samples that received CBT for anxiety disorders, with pre- or post-treatment fMRI data. The data extraction followed a standardized process, with key variables, such as the study design, population, and neuroimaging findings, systematically charted. While the dual-route model explains key aspects of CBT's neurobiological effects, the findings suggest the need for expansion to incorporate areas such as the precuneus, particularly in specific phobias and social anxiety disorder. Further research is required to refine this model and explore additional mechanisms underlying CBT's efficacy."

To date, effective interventions for these patients are lacking.

The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to test the hypothesis that BRIGHT improves BID among HNC survivors relative to an Attention Control (AC) intervention. In this multisite RCT, N = 180 HNC survivors with BID will be randomized 1:1 to six weeks of BRIGHT or AC of dose and delivery-matched survivorship education. Outcomes are assessed at baseline and 2, 3, 6, and 9-months post-randomization. The primary endpoint is the IMAGE-HN (Inventory to Measure and Assess imaGe disturbancE-Head and Neck) score, a validated patient-reported outcome of HNC-related BID. Secondary endpoints include the HN Shame and Stigma Scale, the PROMIS SF v1.0-Depression 8a, Anxiety 8a, and Ability to Participate in Social Activities 8a, the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and the EORTC QLQ-HN35 Trouble with Social Eating and Trouble with Social Contact subscales. The trial will also evaluate whether the effect of BRIGHT on BID is mediated through improvements in automatic thinking and body image coping strategies. Findings from this multisite RCT will provide a rigorous test of the efficacy of BRIGHT as the first evidence-based strategy to manage BID among HNC survivors. TRIAL REGISTRATION ID: NCT05442957."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Therapist-guided, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (guided ICBT) appears to be efficacious for depression, panic disorder (PD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in routine care clinical settings. However, implementation of guided ICBT in specialist mental health services is limited partly due to low referral rates from general practitioners (GP), which may stem from lack of awareness, limited knowledge of its effectiveness, or negative attitudes toward the treatment format. In response, self-referral systems were introduced in mental health care about a decade ago to improve access to care, yet little is known about how referral pathways may affect treatment outcomes in guided ICBT. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the overall treatment effectiveness of GP referral and self-referral to guided ICBT for patients with depression, PD, or SAD in a specialized routine care clinic. This study also explores if the treatment effectiveness varies between referral pathways and the respective diagnoses. METHODS: This naturalistic open effectiveness study compares treatment outcomes from pretreatment to posttreatment and from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up across 2 referral pathways. All patients underwent module-based guided ICBT lasting up to 14 weeks. The modules covered psychoeducation, working with negative or automatic thoughts, exposure training, and relapse prevention. Patients received weekly therapist guidance through asynchronous messaging, with therapists spending an average of 10-30 minutes per patient per week. Patients self-reported symptoms before, during, immediately after, and 6 months posttreatment. Level and change in symptom severity were measured across all diagnoses. RESULTS: In total, 460 patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 305 were GP-referred (\"GP\" group) and 155 were self-referred (\"self\" group). Across the total sample, about 60% were female, and patients had a mean age of 32 years and average duration of disorder of 10 years. We found no significant differences in pretreatment symptom levels between referral pathways and across the diagnoses. Estimated effect sizes based on linear mixed modeling showed large improvements from pretreatment to posttreatment and from pretreatment to follow-up across all diagnoses, with statistically significant differences between referral pathways (GP: 0.97-1.22 vs self: 1.34-1.58, P<.001-.002) and for the diagnoses separately: depression (GP: 0.86-1.26, self: 1.97-2.07, P<.001-.02), PD (GP: 1.32-1.60 vs self: 1.64-2.08, P=.06-.02) and SAD (GP: 0.80-0.99 vs self: 0.99-1.19, P=.18-.22). CONCLUSIONS: Self-referral to guided ICBT for depression and PD appears to yield greater treatment outcomes compared to GP referrals. We found no difference in outcome between referral pathway for SAD. This study underscores the potential of self-referral pathways to enhance access to evidence-based psychological treatment, improve treatment outcomes, and promote sustained engagement in specialist mental health services. Future studies should examine the effect of the self-referral pathway when it is implemented on a larger scale.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Chronic pain in pediatric populations presents a multifaceted challenge with biopsychosocial impact, requiring a multidisciplinary approach including psychological treatment. At our interdisciplinary pain center, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related disruptions led to the cessation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other psychological interventions during the pandemic. The aim of this retrospective cohort study with secondary retrospective matched case-control analysis was to evaluate the impact of interruption of non-CBT psychological interventions, namely psychoanalysis and psychodynamic psychotherapy, on children and adolescents with chronic pain conditions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included pediatric patients with primary and secondary chronic pain conditions evaluated by our team during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We excluded patients who did not receive psychological intervention when available, those with incomplete data on initial evaluation or follow-up, and those who received outside psychiatric care or individual or group CBT. The primary outcome was a Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score of 6-7. Secondary outcome measures were pain intensity, use of pain medication, sleep, physical function, school attendance, the incidence of suicidality, and the reason for end of treatment. RESULTS: The study included 146 patients, 77 who received non-CBT psychological interventions and 69 who did not receive any psychological interventions. We found no meaningful difference between the use of non-CBT psychological intervention and no treatment in the incidence of PGIC 6-7 points, pain intensity, school attendance, physical function, suicidality, and cause of end of treatment. Patients not receiving any psychological interventions were more likely to have normalized sleep at the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Non-CBT psychological interventions, namely psychoanalysis and psychodynamic psychotherapy, were not associated with meaningful benefits for children and adolescents with chronic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients who did not receive psychological interventions reported normalization of their sleep at the end of treatment compared to those who participated in non-CBT interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Because pediatric anxiety disorders precede the onset of many other problems, successful prediction of response to the first-line treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), could have a major impact. This study evaluates whether structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can predict post-CBT anxiety symptoms. METHODS: Two datasets were studied: (A) one consisted of n = 54 subjects with an anxiety diagnosis, who received 12 weeks of CBT, and (B) one consisted of n = 15 subjects treated for 8 weeks. Connectome predictive modeling (CPM) was used to predict treatment response, as assessed with the PARS. The main analysis included network edges positively correlated with treatment outcome and age, sex, and baseline anxiety severity as predictors. Results from alternative models and analyses are also presented. Model assessments utilized 1000 bootstraps, resulting in a 95% CI for R2, r, and mean absolute error (MAE). RESULTS: The main model showed a MAE of approximately 3.5 (95% CI: [3.1-3.8]) points, an R2 of 0.08 [-0.14-0.26], and an r of 0.38 [0.24-0.511]. When testing this model in the left-out sample (B), the results were similar, with an MAE of 3.4 [2.8-4.7], R2-0.65 [-2.29-0.16], and r of 0.4 [0.24-0.54]. The anatomical metrics showed a similar pattern, where models rendered overall low R2. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis showed that models based on earlier promising results failed to predict clinical outcomes. Despite the small sample size, this study does not support the extensive use of CPM to predict outcomes in pediatric anxiety.",

METHODS: A total of 230 elderly patients with depression admitted to our hospital from were selected as the observation objects. The control group (n = 115) was treated with escitalopram, and the observation group (n = 115) was combined with cognitive behavioral therapy on the basis of escitalopram. The levels of serum laboratory indexes (S100 protein, cortisol (Cor), homocysteine (Hcy), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE)), daily living ability, depression status and cognitive function in 2 groups before and after treatment were observed. RESULTS: After treatment, the levels of S100 protein, Cor and Hcy in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group, while the levels of 5-HT, DA and NE were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the Barthel index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of the observation group were significantly higher than that of the control group, while the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The treatment efficiency (95.65 %) was significantly higher than that of the control group (85.22 %), and the total incidence of adverse reactions (6.09 %) during the treatment period was significantly lower than that of the control group(17.39 %) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: For elderly patients with depression, combined cognitive behavioral therapy based on escitalopram help patients to further improve the ability of daily living, improve depression, and promote the recovery of cognitive function."

METHODS: This quasi-experimental study enrolled 90 glioma patients from Sanmenxia Central Hospital between January and December 2021. Patients were divided into an intervention group (n = 45) or a control group (n = 45). The intervention group received cognitive behavioral therapy provided by nurses, while the control group received routine nursing care. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Mishel uncertainty in illness scale (MUIS), life events scale (LES), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and quality of life scale (WHOQOL-BREF). RESULTS: After four cycles of chemotherapy, the study group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in MUIS and LES scores compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The study group showed significantly lower SAS and SDS scores than the control group (p < 0.05). Finally, the study group reported significantly higher WHOQOL-BREF scores than the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study revealed that the group that received CBT showed significant improvements in the psychological well-being of glioma patients undergoing chemotherapy. These findings suggest that incorporating CBT into standard nursing care can effectively improve the psychological well-being and quality of life of glioma patients during chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety significantly affects persons with Parkinson's disease (PwP), often emerging in the prodromal phase before the onset of symptoms and persisting throughout the disease's course. It is among the most disabling, stigmatizing, and under-recognized symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Consequently, it is critical to provide tools that can be universally applied and that are accessible to help all PwP live better. This article discusses the nature of anxiety in PwP, how to identify it, and how to treat it across stages of the disease. We highlight cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy in widespread use for anxiety and depression in general and increasingly used in PwP. The neurologist can apply the basic principles of CBT. The principles can be used by clinicians who are treating PwP globally, as they require no pharmacological intervention and minimal resources. As the disease progresses, a multidisciplinary team may be preferable to address the complex challenges that PD presents, including anxiety. The focus is on a patient-centered approach, providing compassion, hope, and resources to optimize the mental and physical well-being of PwP. Empowering PwP fosters self-agency and can significantly improve quality of life."

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia affects up to 50% of patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, but little is known on the effects of CBT-I in patients with established CVD. We aimed to investigate the effects of CBT-I on insomnia symptom severity, sleep parameters, and daytime symptoms in patients with CVD and comorbid insomnia. METHODS: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled and open trials up to December 2023. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment (Cochrane's risk of bias 2 tool) were independently conducted by co-authors. Data were meta-analyzed using random-effects models. RESULTS: In all, 1275 records with five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (n=352 patients). Compared with active control groups, CBT-I significantly reduced insomnia severity post-treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.90, 95%CI: -1.43, -0.37, p < .001), sleep onset latency (SOL), anxiety, and fatigue. Moreover, CBT-I significantly improved sleep quality (SMD = -0.77, 95%CI: -1.10, -0.45, p < .001) and sleep efficiency (SMD = 0.68, 95%CI: 0.12-1.25, p < .001). We regarded three RCTs as having low risk of bias, and had some concerns with another. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from our analyses indicated that CBT-I seems to be effective for alleviating insomnia symptoms among CVD patients, largely in line with the results of previous meta-analyses in patients with insomnia. The limited sample size encourages more robust evidence from high-quality, large-scale trials with long-term follow-up.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, associated with numerous acute and chronic medical conditions. Digital health interventions offer a promising solution to overcome barriers associated with traditional treatment methods, providing accessible, scalable, and cost-effective means to support individuals in reducing hazardous drinking. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Sober smartphone app in individuals with hazardous alcohol use. METHODS: This single-group, pre- and postpilot study included 20 participants with risky alcohol use, identified using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Participants used the Sober app for 4 weeks, incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions. Feasibility was assessed by study and session completion rates, acceptability by participant satisfaction and perceived usefulness, and preliminary efficacy by changes in alcohol consumption and psychiatric symptoms. Semistructured interviews with participants and clinicians provided qualitative perspectives on the app's usability, efficacy, and areas for improvement. RESULTS: Of the 20 enrolled participants, 17 completed the study. The app demonstrated high feasibility with an 85% (17/20) study completion rate, and 59% (10/17) completed all cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. Participants reported positive acceptability, with average satisfaction and usefulness ratings of 3.8 and 3.7 of 5, respectively. Preliminary efficacy outcomes showed significant improvements: abstinence days increased from 67% to 85% (z=-3.17; P=.002), heavy drinking episodes decreased from 3.3 to 1.9 (t16=-2.97; P=.003), and total alcohol consumption reduced from 456.8 to 195.9 mL (t16=3.16; P=.002). Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores dropped from 17.5 to 10.7 (t16=4.51; P<.001). Additionally, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) scores decreased from 5.8 to 4.4 (t16=2.91; P=.01), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) scores from 3.4 to 2.1 (z=-2.80; P=.005). No adverse events were reported. Qualitative analysis found participants valued daily logging but noted usability issues, while clinicians called for tailored goals, enhanced communication features, and age-specific content. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile app Sober shows promise as an effective tool for reducing hazardous alcohol consumption and improving related psychiatric symptoms. The study demonstrated high feasibility and positive acceptability, with significant preliminary efficacy in reducing alcohol use. Qualitative findings provided actionable evidence for refining the app's usability and clinical integration. Further research through a randomized controlled trial is warranted to confirm these findings and optimize the app's features and content.",

      "abstract": "The accessibility of training and fidelity assessment is critical to implementing and sustaining empirically supported psychotherapies like cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp). We describe the development of an online CBTp training tool that incorporates behavioral rehearsal tasks to enable deliberate practice of cognitive and behavioral techniques for psychosis. The development process consisted of designing content, inclusive of didactics, client profiles, and learner prompts; constructing standardized performance tasks and metrics; collecting responses to learner prompts; establishing intraclass correlation (ICC) of responses among trained raters; and training a transformer-based machine learning (ML) model to meet or surpass human ICC. Authenticity ratings of each simulated client surpassed benchmarks. CBTp trainers (n = 12), clinicians (n = 78), and nonclinicians (n = 119) generated 3,958 unique verbal responses to 28 unique prompts (7 skills × 4 simulated clients), of which the coding team rated 1,961. Human ICC across all skills was high (mean ICC = 0.77). On average, there was a high correlation between ML and human ratings of fidelity (rs = .74). Similarly, the average percentage of human agreement was high at 96% (range = 87%-102%), where values greater than 100 indicate that the ML model agreed with a human rater more than two human raters agreed with each other. Results suggest that it is possible to reliably measure discrete CBTp skills in response to simulated client vignettes while capturing expected variation in skill utilization across participants. These findings pave the way for a standardized, asynchronous training that incorporates automated feedback on learners' rehearsal of CBTp skills.

      "abstract": "Background: Although digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) is considered effective for anxiety disorders, there is considerable heterogeneity in its efficacy across studies, and its varied treatment content and clinical components may explain such heterogeneity. Objective: This review aimed to identify the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder and agoraphobia, and examine whether applying relevant clinical components of interoceptive exposure, inhibitory-learning-based exposure, and personalization of treatment enhances its efficacy. Methods: Randomized controlled trials of dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia with passive or active controls were identified from OVID Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. The overall effect sizes for dCBT groups (interventions through digital platforms based on the internet, mobile, computers, VR, etc.) were aggregated against passive control (placebo/sham) and active control (traditional CBT) groups. For subgroup analysis, key intervention components such as interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, and personalization were assessed dichotomously (0 or 1) along with other study characteristics. The stepwise meta-regression models were applied with traditional and Bayesian statistical testing. The risk of bias and publication bias of included studies were assessed. Results: Among the 31 selected studies, dCBT had an overall effect size of g = 0.70 against passive control and g = -0.05 against active control. In subgroup analysis, interoceptive exposure improved the clinical effects for both controls, and inhibitory learning and personalization increased the clinical effects for passive control along with therapist guide/support and the length of sessions. Many studies were vulnerable to therapist bias and attrition bias. No publication bias was detected. Conclusions: The heterogeneity in clinical effects of dCBT for panic and agoraphobia can be explained by the different intervention factors they include. For effective dCBT, therapists should consider the clinical components relevant to the treatment."

      "abstract": "Objective: This review identifies the characteristic features of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and their therapeutic effect; assesses their efficacy in treatment of depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders; and establishes levels of user engagement and satisfaction. Method : Searches were conducted on the PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases using a set of keywords such as, not limited to, AI cognitive behavioral therapy (AI CBT), Youper, Wysa, Woebot, and other related terms. We included studies that were empirical, peer-reviewed, conducted between January 2017 and June 2024, and primarily focused on efficacy regarding the interventions and therapeutic outcomes. Data were then extracted and analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods concerning the mental health outcome. Results: Our review identified large improvements across the three chatbots in symptoms of mental health, as supported by the 10 included studies: five on Woebot, four on Wysa, and one on Youper. Woebot showed remarkable reductions in depression and anxiety with high user engagement; Wysa demonstrated similar improvements, especially in users with chronic pain or maternal mental health challenges; Youper also presented a significant symptom reduction, including a 48% decrease in depression and a 43% decrease in anxiety. Common benefits of all chatbots were the therapeutic alliance and a high rate of satisfaction among users. We have also discussed the included studies' limitations; that is, study design shortcomings and lack of sample diversity. Conclusion: AI CBT chatbots, including but not limited to Woebot, Wysa, and Youper, are highly promising because of their availability and effectiveness in mental health support. They provide a useful complement to standard therapy when professional help is unavailable, and offer constant engagement with tailored interventions. However, it is necessary that further studies investigate their potential impact as long-term intervention models and explore how they may be integrated into holistic mental health care systems."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Symptoms of insomnia, nightmares, and trauma are highly prevalent. However, there are significant barriers to accessing evidence-based treatments for these conditions, leading to poor mental health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This pilot trial evaluated the feasibility of a 4-week, digital self-paced intervention combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy for nightmares in survivors of wildfires from Australia, Canada, and the United States. METHODS: Study participants were recruited between May 2023 and December 2023 through social media platforms, workshops, conferences, and radio interviews. Participants had to meet at least one of the following criteria: a score of ≥8 on the Insomnia Severity Index, a score of ≥3 on the Nightmare Disorder Index, or a score of ≥31 on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. In total, 30 survivors of wildfires were allocated to either the treatment group (n=16, 53%) or the waitlist control group (n=14, 47%) in a sequential manner. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 79 years, with a mean age of 52.50 (SD 16.26) years. The cohort consisted of 63% (19/30) female and 37% (11/30) male participants. Participants also completed self-report secondary outcome measures, including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, via the HealthZone digital platform. Assessments were conducted at baseline, the posttreatment time point, and the 3-month follow-up, with the waitlist group undergoing an additional assessment at the pretreatment time point, after 4 weeks of waiting and before crossing over to treatment. This study used intention-to-treat analysis as a primary analysis and per-protocol analysis as a secondary analysis. RESULTS: Mixed-effects linear regression models and difference-in-differences analyses were used to assess the intervention's effects. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed significant improvements over time (main effect of time), with a 1.64-point reduction (P=.001) on the Nightmare Disorder Index and 10.64-point reduction (P=.009) on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 at the postintervention time point. No significant changes were observed in insomnia symptoms. On the secondary measures, there was an interaction effect of condition × time, with a 2.22-point reduction (P<.001) on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and a main effect of time, with a 6.48-point reduction (P<.001) on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. No changes were detected on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. The per-protocol analysis yielded comparable results for both the primary and secondary measures. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot trial demonstrated a reduction in nightmares and trauma symptoms. Future research studies should aim at evaluating the intervention in a more definitive trial with a larger sample size.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the preferred treatment for insomnia in patients with comorbid insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (COMISA), the remission rate with CBT-I is generally considered lower than in insomnia-only populations. There is also a sizable variability in individual treatment responses. Due to the limited availability of CBT-I, we sought to identify specific clinical attributes that predict benefit from Brief Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (BBTI)-an adaptation of CBT-I-in patients with COMISA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the National Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic medical records covering veterans diagnosed with COMISA between January 2021 and December 2023. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores were recorded at baseline and after 12±1 weeks after BBTI. A positive response to BBTI was defined as a reduction in ISI score of ≥ 8 from baseline. A multivariate generalized linear model analysis was performed to delineate predictive factors of BBTI responsiveness. RESULTS: 131 eligible cases received BBTI over 6 weeks, 56 (43%) of whom did not respond. Non-whites (OR 3.5, 95% CI [1.4, 8.8]) and shorter sleep time (OR 0.98, 95% CI [0.98, 0.99] were independent predictors of blunted response to BBTI. These findings remained true even when depression and AHI were forced into the regression model. Patients with a total sleep duration of < 4.1 h were at greatest risk of being nonresponsive to BBTI. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that identifying insomnia phenotypes in patients with COMISA would help deliver personalized care while maximizing BBTI treatment resources.",

METHODS: In this three-arm randomized clinical trial, 99 older patients with a primary diagnosis of insomnia were randomly divided into two intervention groups (n = 33) and a control group (n = 33). The study design was a parallel group trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The CBT-I intervention was done in a group format for four weeks, consisting of two 60-min sessions per week. The diaphragmatic breathing intervention was trained in a group setting session and practiced individually for 30 min every night before sleep. The control group received no information about sleep or relaxation. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire before, four weeks, and eight weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were randomized to the CBT-I intervention (n = 33), diaphragmatic breathing intervention (n = 33), or control arm (n = 33), with 74 patients providing final analysis data. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant decrease in sleep quality score (p < 0.001) from pre-test to post-test and one-month follow-ups. The greatest effect of both interventions in reducing the sleep quality score was during the first period of the study (four weeks after the intervention), and there was no significant reduction eight weeks after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Diaphragmatic breathing and CBT-I interventions improved sleep quality indicators among older adults.",

Our randomized controlled trial found significant reductions in pain in youth receiving digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) vs education control. However, little is known about factors that moderate the effects of CBT in adolescents with SCD. This secondary data analysis aims to identify adolescent and family characteristics that moderate treatment effects on pain outcomes in 111 adolescents aged 12 to 18 with SCD (M = 14.9, SD = 1.9, girls = 59%) and their caregivers. Adolescents were randomly assigned to digital CBT (N = 57) or education control (N = 54). Digital CBT included separate content for parents/caregivers (ie, a website to learn problem-solving skills and behavioral and communication strategies) and youths (ie, a smartphone app and website to learn pain management skills). Outcomes were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment (2 months), and follow-up (6 months). Potential moderators included pretreatment variables (ie, adolescent variables: age, executive functioning, anxiety, depression; parent variables: psychological distress, protective behaviors, family functioning). There was a significant overall effect modification on pain intensity outcomes from pretreatment parent psychological distress (P = 0.012), where CBT appeared more effective among those with elevated parental distress. Differential intervention effects were observed across multiple potential moderator groups, though most of these differences did not reach statistical significance. Our study underscores the importance of family factors in understanding the efficacy of digital CBT for adolescent SCD pain, pointing to the need for future research to optimize CBT through targeted family-focused strategies."

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improves obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity in comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA), though the mechanisms underlying this change are unstudied. CBT-I, which promotes sleep continuity and reduces hyperarousal, may improve OSA by raising the respiratory arousal threshold. We aimed to investigate the effect of CBT-I on OSA severity and its impact on the arousal threshold and other endotype traits. METHODS: In this single-arm trial, 25 patients with COMISA (13F:12M, Mage=53.7, SDage=8.7 years) completed a seven-week individual CBT-I program. Patients met diagnostic criteria for insomnia and demonstrated an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 10 events/h (MAHI=35.2, SDAHI=16.4 events/h). Overnight polysomnography before and after CBT-I measured OSA severity, sleep architecture, and the four OSA endotypes (i.e., collapsibility, muscle compensation, loop gain, arousal threshold). RESULTS: There was a 7.7±10.2 event/h reduction in the AHI from baseline to post treatment (p=.001), however, no change in any of the OSA endotype traits studied (all p>.05). Secondary analyses showed a relationship whereby increases in N3 sleep were associated with decreases in AHI (r2=.19, p=.03). Significant improvements were also found in insomnia severity and sleep diary-based sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset at post-treatment (all p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: CBT-I is beneficial in improving insomnia symptoms and we provide further support CBT-I improves OSA severity. Despite no change in the OSA endotype traits, the improvement in the AHI may be associated with increased amounts N3 sleep. These results underscore the importance of managing insomnia in COMISA.

Fully automated digital CBT-I (FA dCBT-I) provides an accessible alternative without therapist involvement. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of FA dCBT-I across 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 9475 participants. Compared to control groups, FA dCBT-I demonstrated moderate to large effects on insomnia severity. Subgroup analyses indicated that FA dCBT-I had a significant impact when contrasted with most control groups but was less effective than therapist-assisted CBT-I. Meta-regression revealed that control group type moderated outcomes, whereas completion rate did not. This implies that treatment adherence, rather than merely completing the intervention, is crucial for its effectiveness. This study supports the potential of FA dCBT-I as a promising option for managing insomnia but underscores that a hybrid model combining therapist support is more beneficial."

Therefore, this retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on glaucoma or cataracts patients with mild to moderate depression. METHODS: This study included patients with mild to moderate depression resulting from glaucoma or cataracts in our hospital from January 2023 to December 2023. The study participants were divided into an untreated group and a cognitive behavioral therapy group based on different intervention methods. We assessed depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). QOL was evaluated using the Chinese translation version of the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions scale (EQ-5D), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A). Additionally, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was administered to a subgroup of patients with mild to moderate depression, and the impact of CBT on the well-being of the patients was analyzed. RESULTS: This study included 3010 individuals, consisting of untreated patients (n = 2151) and those who received cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 859). Post-intervention analysis revealed that compared to baseline, the CES-D scores (p < 0.001), PHQ-9 scores (p < 0.001), and HADS anxiety subscale scores (p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the CBT group. Furthermore, the CBT group demonstrated a significant increase in EQ-5D scores (p < 0.001) and SF-36 mental component scores (p < 0.001) post-intervention compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: These findings offer significant insights into the prospective effectiveness of CBT in improving depressive symptoms and QOL in individuals with glaucoma or cataracts.",

Seventy-two MDD participants were randomized to CCBT or waitlist control groups and compared to 40 healthy controls (HCs). Functional MRI data were collected for all participants and repeated for patients following CCBT (five therapist-administered manualized CBT sessions plus computer training exercises). Linear mixed-effects models evaluated changes in depression scores throughout treatment and in connectivity from pre- to post-CCBT. Linear regression models compared connectivity differences between groups (MDD vs. HC). Following CCBT, there were decreases in MADRS and BDI (ps < 0.001); there was more negative connectivity of dlPFC with sgACC and DMN with sgACC (ps < 0.002); and there was more positive connectivity of FPN with nucleus accumbens, bilateral amygdalae, bilateral hippocampi, and sgACC and of DMN with ventral and dorsal bilateral anterior insulae (ps < 0.01). There were no associations between change in MADRS and change in connectivity; however, there was an association between change in BDI and change in FPN-sgACC connectivity (p = 0.01). A shortened CBT schedule coupled with home computer exercises was associated with decreased depression symptoms and augmented PFC connectivity with multiple subcortical regions. One possible mechanism of the CCBT intervention is modulating PFC connectivity with subcortical regions, influencing top-down control of affective processes dysregulated in MDD."

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and structured quality appraisals were used to ensure rigor. Studies evaluated CBT's effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation/attempts. RESULTS: Studies (N = 7) included participants (N = 3,996) from four countries (Australia, Canada, Iran, and the United States). Six of seven studies demonstrated statistically significant reductions in suicidal ideation with CBT (p ≤ 0.05). School-based programs showed feasibility in reducing suicide risk while enhancing coping skills. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: CBT is a safe and effective intervention for reducing suicide risk in adolescents. Findings support its potential as an approach for youth, with further research needed to explore long-term outcomes and diverse populations.

OBJECTIVE: To explore predictors of adherence and clinical response among individuals with co-occurring chronic low back pain (CLBP) and depression receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). METHODS: This study employs a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial (NCT04140838), including 156 individuals with CLBP plus depressive symptoms who received CBT. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the predictive power of sociodemographic, health status, pain-related, and therapy-related variables on adherence and clinical response. Adherence was measured by therapy progress (number of completed sessions) and therapy completion (attendance at least six out of eight sessions). Clinical response was assessed by a clinically relevant reduction in posttreatment pain interference. RESULTS: Older age, higher therapy credibility, and higher education level predicted greater therapy progress, while higher therapy credibility and lower baseline stress levels predicted greater therapy completion. In addition, higher opioid use, baseline pain interference, and baseline depression levels predicted lower clinical response; in contrast, higher behavioral activation levels, older age, and unemployment predicted higher clinical response. CONCLUSION: Therapy credibility, age, and education level are key predictors of adherence, and baseline levels of pain interference, depression, and behavioral activation are key predictors of clinical response. These findings may inform opportunities to develop more effective personalized therapeutic plans for individuals with CLBP and depression."

METHOD: In the prospective, randomized superiority Binge-Eating Disorder in Adolescents (BEDA) trial, evaluating the efficacy of CBT with 20 individual sessions over 4 months versus WL, clinical and cost data were assessed at baseline and after 4 months. Missing values were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. To reflect uncertainty, nonparametric bootstrapping was performed, and the results were presented in the form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). RESULTS: The study population consisted of 73 adolescents (82.2% female, mean age: 15.5 ± 2.6 years). Participants receiving CBT (n = 37) exhibited 4.7 more binge-free episodes (p = 0.0056) than the WL group (n = 36). The ICER was €46.70 for the gain of a binge-free episode and €128,861 for the gain of a QALY. DISCUSSION: The probability of cost-effectiveness for achieving a binge-free episode is > 95% at a willingness-to-pay of €101. In terms of QALYs, CBT for BED may be a cost-effective intervention. A longer follow-up period may have yielded more favorable cost-effectiveness results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register, https://www.drks.de, DRKS00000542."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based therapies (MBT) are proposed as a \"third wave\" of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This network meta-analysis investigated this hypothesis by comparing the effectiveness of MBT and CBT for treating depression, measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). METHODS: An indirect comparison was made. Relevant databases were searched for studies comparing either CBT or MBT with treatment as usual (TAU). Mean differences (MD) between intervention and TAU were calculated using changes from baseline from both intervention (Me) and TAU-group (Mc). MDs of CBT and MBT were compared in a network meta-analysis. Results were reported for both the common-effects-model (CEM) and the random-effects-model (REM). Risk of Bias (RoB) was measured using the RoB-2-tool. Quality of evidence was investigated based on GRADE. RESULTS: Eight MBT and ten CBT studies, meeting eligibility since 2006, were included. MBT studies included behavioral activation with mindfulness, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, person-based cognitive therapy, and a newly developed meditation-based lifestyle modification program. Both CBT and MBT differed significantly from TAU. In the unweighted CEM network meta-analysis, MBT showed significantly better treatment effect, but this was below the clinically relevant threshold (MD:-1.81). For REM and weighted analysis, there were no significant differences between CBT and MBT. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity, high RoB, and low evidence quality were notable, with indirectness limiting this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: CBT and MBT both showed significant and clinically important treatment effects for depression. However, an outstanding benefit of MBT in comparison to CBT could not be found in this analysis. Further research could include a direct comparison.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Negative effects of psychotherapy encompass unwanted events caused by the treatment. Evidence exists that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can lead to negative effects (e.g., exhaustion, reduced motivation). Psychometrically validated instruments are needed to enable systematic investigation of negative effects and their consequences. This study aimed to develop an insomnia-specific extension for the Negative Effect Questionnaire (NEQ) and to evaluate its psychometric properties. METHOD: Based on a literature review, an item pool was developed as an extension to the NEQ. This item pool was iteratively refined. Both the NEQ and the developed item pool were administered to participants enrolled in a stepped-care model for insomnia that includes an internet-delivered CBT-I. The psychometric properties of the item pool were evaluated using confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). Additionally, responses to open-ended questions were categorized and analyzed. RESULTS: Data from 210 participants were available. In the newly developed item pool, participants reported a mean of 4.7 negative effects (range: 0 to 22). CFA indicated a good fit (RSMEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.07) of a model with five latent factors (somatic symptoms, cognitive symptoms, safety, emotional symptoms, daytime functioning). The correlation analyses between the model's latent factors and the NEQ subscales indicated adequate discriminant validity. DISCUSSION: The observed prevalence rates of insomnia-specific negative effects highlight the need to assess the negative effects of CBT-I with an insomnia-specific instrument. The CFA suggests that the 24-item NEQ-Insomnia is a valid instrument, suitable for standalone use or as an extension to the NEQ for assessing the negative effects of CBT-I.",

METHODS: We systematically searched nine databases through May 2024 without date restrictions using the following search terms: (cognitive behavio* therapy) AND (addict* OR dependen*) AND ((internet or gaming) AND dis*). Studies included were primary studies with evaluating CBT in patients with internet gaming disorders. Studies were included if they used a control group and were written in English. Both randomized control trials and quasi-experimental designs were included. We used a random-effects model to compute effect sizes (ESs) using Hedges' g, forest plot, and Q and I2 statistics as measures of heterogeneity. We also examined moderator analyses. RESULTS: We found 13 studies with 1,115 participants (19.08±3.99 years old) that met inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Overall, patients with internet gaming disorders in the CBT group demonstrated significantly lower addiction symptoms (g = 0.72, 95 %CI:.420, 1.011, p<.001) compared to controls. Regarding moderators, funding, characteristics' participants at baseline, group discussion, length of intervention and dose were moderators affecting the ES. CONCLUSION: CBTs are moderately effective interventions to reduce addiction symptoms among patients with internet gaming disorders. Clinicians might consider encouraging CBTs as alternative treatments for patients with internet gaming disorders. CBTs with a long length and high dose of intervention for practicing are likely to have a greater effect in reducing addiction symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women are particularly vulnerable to depression during pregnancy, which is one of the strongest risk factors for developing postpartum depression (PPD). Addressing antenatal depressive symptoms in these women is crucial for preventing PPD. However, little is known about the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) in preventing PPD in this high-risk group. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of ICBT in preventing PPD among women with antenatal depressive symptoms. METHODS: Participants were screened for antenatal depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and randomly allocated (1:1) to either the ICBT group (receiving weekly online modules starting antenatally and continuing into early postpartum) or the control group (observed without treatment). Follow-up assessments were conducted up to 12 months postpartum, and data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. The primary outcome was the prevalence of depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. A subgroup analysis based on the severity of antenatal depressive symptoms was also performed. The secondary outcomes included the long-term effects of ICBT on maternal depression, as well as its impact on anxiety, sleep quality, social support, parenting stress, co-parenting relationships, and infant development. RESULTS: Between August 2020 and September 2021, 300 pregnant individuals were recruited from 5 centers across China. No significant differences were observed in depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum (P=.18) or at any longer-term follow-up time points (P=.18). However, a post hoc subgroup analysis showed that participants with antenatal EPDS scores of 10-12 in the ICBT group had a lower risk of developing depression during the first year postpartum (odds ratio 0.534, 95% CI 0.313-0.912; P=.02), but this was not observed for participants with more severe depression. Additionally, this subgroup demonstrated higher levels of co-parenting relationships (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with antenatal depression, ICBT did not prevent the development of PPD. However, ICBT may be a preferable option for those with mild to moderate antenatal depressive symptoms. Future research is needed to explore modifications to ICBT to address more severe depressive symptoms.

Identifying predictors for change in symptom severity after treatment could inform clinical decision-making, allow for better-tailored interventions, and avoid treatment failure. Prior research on predictors for treatment response has, however, yielded inconsistent findings with limited clinical utility. Here, we investigated the predictive power of nine polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for psychiatric and cognitive traits in 1598 OCD patients (1167 adults and 431 children/adolescents) treated with CBT in Sweden and Norway. We fitted linear mixed models adjusted for age, sex, genotyping batch, and the first five ancestry PCs to estimate associations between PRS and symptom severity change from pre- to post-treatment. The PRS for schizophrenia showed a modestly significant association with symptom change (β = 0.013, p = 0.04, R2 = 0.10), indicating that a higher PRS for schizophrenia was associated with a smaller decrease in symptom severity. No other PRS were significantly associated with the outcome. While these results await replication and expansion, current PRS for psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes do not seem to contribute meaningfully to symptom severity change in CBT for OCD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological resilience refers to maintaining or regaining psychological well-being after experiencing adversity, trauma, or stress. There is evidence suggesting that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can significantly enhance an individual's coping skills. However, the overall effectiveness of CBT on resilience among cancer patients remains unclear. Therefore, this study systematically evaluated the impact of CBT on resilience among cancer patients. METHODS: The PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched using keywords. Two researchers independently conducted a rigorous evaluation of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system and independently performed data extraction. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the experimental group's effect size and to explore the effects of CBT on enhancing resilience. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. The effect of CBT on increasing resilience among cancer patients was small but significant immediately after the intervention (g = 1.211; p < 0.001). The results showed that CBT delivered via mobile devices was more effective than face-to-face CBT (β = 0.284; P = 0.012). Additionally, group CBT also outperformed individual CBT (β = 0.181; P = 0.042). Furthermore, CBT was more effective among patients with existing tumors (β = 0.285; P = 0.037). The evidence regarding the effects of CBT on resilience was found to be of moderate strength. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate CBT can improve resilience among cancer patients. These findings underscore the importance of considering delivery methods and formats when implementing CBT interventions, with mobile device delivery and group formats resulting in better outcomes. The positive effects of CBT on patients with existing tumors highlight the importance of delivering this therapy in specific clinical contexts. Overall, this study provided moderately strong evidence that CBT is a valuable tool for enhancing resilience among cancer patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CRD42021256841.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of mental disorders among children and youth has significantly increased, with rising rates of anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders globally. Despite the widespread adoption of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a standardized treatment for various mental disorders, its efficacy can be constrained due to limited patient engagement, lack of commitment, and stigma, all challenges pronounced among children and youth. In this context, extended reality (XR) technologies (including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality) have emerged as innovative therapeutic tools offering immersive and engaging environments to overcome the limitations of traditional CBT. OBJECTIVES: This protocol aims to outline the methodology for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of XR-CBT on symptoms of mental disorders among children and youth. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will follow PRISMA-P 2015 guidelines. A comprehensive search will be conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies published between January 2014 and June 2024. Eligible studies must involve children and youth (ages 24 years or younger) diagnosed with a mental disorder (e.g., anxiety, depression, ADHD, PTSD) and compare XR-CBT interventions (virtual, augmented, or mixed reality) with traditional therapy or control groups (e.g., no treatment). The primary outcome will be the change in symptoms of mental disorders, measured using standardized instruments (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS). Data will be extracted on post-intervention means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals. Effect sizes, calculated using Hedges' g, will be pooled with a random-effects model. Moreover, an a priori meta-regression within a random-effects framework will be conducted to examine how study-level characteristics influence effect sizes and address heterogeneity across studies. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic and the Cochran's Q test. Risk of bias in individual studies will be evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol establishes a structured approach for assessing the efficacy of XR-CBT interventions on mental disorders among children and youth. The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis will fill a gap in current research and inform future therapeutic applications for mental health interventions among children and youth.",

      "abstract": "Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT), which involves the use of a digital application to support face-to-face psychotherapy, is increasingly offered to patients with depression amid a growing body of research on its efficacy. However, there is still limited understanding of the factors that influence the efficacy of this novel treatment method. To investigate the effects of potential factors such as patient satisfaction with the received treatment, patients' self-rated working alliance with their therapist, and patients' rating of system usability of the digital application, this secondary analysis study focused on a sample of 66 university students who completed an effective 6-week bCBT program that included weekly sessions with a therapist and access to a digital mental health application. We examined whether those three potential factors predict patients' improvement in depressive symptoms in a bCBT treatment. Patient satisfaction and working alliance are known predictors of treatment success in standard psychotherapy, yet their importance in blended treatment is largely unstudied. System usability is a factor that is frequently addressed while describing digital treatment programs, yet its contribution to the success of treatments has been mostly omitted. All the variables analyzed displayed a significant positive correlation with improvement in depressive symptoms. When taken together, all the factors account for 16.6 % of the variance in the outcome. However, when three variables were added in the backward multiple linear regression with stepwise elimination, only patient satisfaction emerged as a predictor of the outcome. Although there are significant correlations between working alliance and system usability and the improvement of depression in the bCBT program, their lack of predictive power in comparison to patient satisfaction renders the results inconclusive. Future studies could explore the potential contribution of additional variables to the improvement of depressive symptoms."

Many adolescents and young adults do not receive treatment. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-i) can fill this gap. This study assesses the effectiveness of the iCBT-i intervention \"iSleep youth\". METHODS: Patients (12-30 years old) with an Insomnia Severity Index ≥8, ≥6 months after treatment, and <10 years after diagnosis were 1:1 randomized to iSleep youth or the wait list-control group. iSleep youth consists of five online sessions with a coach. Outcomes were sleep efficiency (actigraph-based), insomnia, fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Differences over time between iSleep youth and controls, 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T6) from baseline, were assessed with linear mixed models, controlling for age, sex, and time since end of treatment. iSleep youth also had a follow-up measurement after 12 months (T12). RESULTS: Fifty-four (response rate, 49%) patients participated: 68.9% females, mean age, 18.5 years (SD = 3.5), and mean time since end of treatment 3.8 years (SD = 2.3). No significant effects between the two groups were found for sleep efficiency. However, iSleep youth had a beneficial effect on insomnia severity at T3 (β = -0.79) and T6 (β = -0.55), on fatigue at T3 (β = -1.08) and T6 (β = -0.52) and on HRQOL at T3 (β = 0.46) and T6 (β = 0.62). The scores did not change from T6 to T12 in iSleep youth. CONCLUSIONS: iSleep youth is effective in treating insomnia and concurrent fatigue in adolescents and young adults after childhood cancer and should be implemented.",

Method: 120 adult Spanish victims, who met the criteria for current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and/or anxiety disorders related to exposure to terrorist attacks that occurred 18 years ago, on average, were randomly assigned to 16 weekly sessions of TF-CBT (n = 60) or waiting list control conditions (n = 60). Results: Participants who completed TF-CBT (n = 25) experienced significant pre-post decreases in diagnostic rates and in posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Pre/post effect sizes for the TF-CBT-treated participants were large (gPCL-S = 1.25; gBDI-II = 1.03; gBAI = 1.16), and between-groups effect sizes were medium-large (gPCL-S =  0.94, gBDI-II = 0.72, gBAI = 0.95). Most TF-CBT completers (78.3% to 91.7%) achieved sub-syndromal symptom levels by post-treatment. The benefits persisted to the 6-month follow-up (n = 22). Modified intention-to-treat analyses (n = 35 vs. n = 50) confirmed the significance of the findings for PTSD and were significant but less robust for MDD and anxiety disorders. Conclusion: TF-CBT appears to be efficacious when applied to victims of terrorism with long-term psychopathology. CLINICAL OR METHODOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ARTICLE: TF-CBT was efficacious when applied to victims of terrorism with long-term PTSD. Results were significant but less robust for long-term MDD and anxiety disorders."

      "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of single-visit dentist-led cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing dental fear and anxiety (DFA) and improving cooperation in children aged six to eight years undergoing dental treatment with and without local anesthesia (LA). Methods: Seventy-six children (six to eight years) with a Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS) score of 38 or higher, needing dental treatment, either with LA (N equals 38) or without LA (n equals 38), were randomly divided into two groups: Group I received conventional behavior guidance techniques (control), and Group II received CBT. Dental procedures were video recorded. Anxiety and cooperation were assessed using Venham's clinical anxiety scale (VCAS) and Venham's clinical cooperation scale (VCCS), respectively. Pre-operative and post-operative pulse rate and CFSS-DS scores were recorded. Results: CBT significantly reduced CFSS-DS scores in children undergoing dental treatment with LA (P<0.001) and without LA (P=0.003). Post-operative VCAS and VCCS scores were comparatively lower in children who received CBT, irrespective of the treatment. Additionally, CBT significantly lowered VCCS scores in children undergoing treatment with LA (P=0.046). Conclusion: Cognitive behavioral therapy effectively reduced dental fear and anxiety in children undergoing dental treatment with and without local anesthesia and is a feasible behavior management strategy.",
