      "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia is a chronic dermatological condition in which genetically predisposed individuals undergo progressive hair loss secondary to the effects of circulating androgens. It has been well documented that dihydrotestosterone binds to the androgenic receptors prevalent in the scalp, thus inducing miniaturization of the hair follicle. To date, the only FDA approved medications for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia are finasteride and minoxidil. A plethora of studies have been conducted testing the efficacy of various herbal compounds, but additional research is needed to further establish the concrete efficacy of such natural remedies in treating androgenetic alopecia. Of late, rosemary oil has gained mass popularity as a promising natural alternative. This review article will not only provide a detailed background on this ancient herbal component but will additionally overview all other major herbal alternatives including peppermint oil, tea tree oil, green tea, pumpkin seed oil, saw palmetto, and lavender oil and will summarize the latest clinical studies, which have tested their efficacy for the management of androgenetic alopecia."

      "abstract": "This study focuses on optimizing the delivery of Nelfinavir (NFV), a vital protease inhibitor in antiretroviral therapy, and Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a potent adjunctive anti- human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) agent found in green tea. The challenge lies in NFV's low intrinsic dissolution rate, significant p-gp efflux, and high hepatic metabolism, necessitating frequent and high-dose administration. Our objective was to develop a nanoemulsion loaded with NFV and EGCG to enhance oral delivery, expediting antiretroviral effects for NeuroAIDS treatment. After meticulous excipient screening, we selected Tween 40 as the surfactant and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) as the co-surfactant. Employing a Quality by Design (QbD) approach with statistical multivariate methods, we optimized the nanoemulsion that exhibited a droplet size of 83.21 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.289, transmittance of 95.20 %, zeta potential of 1.495 mV, pH of 6.95, refractive index of 1.40, viscosity of 24.00 ± 0.42 mPas, and conductivity of 0.162 μS/cm. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated superior in vivo absorption of the optimized nanoemulsion compared to NFV and EGCG suspension. The optimized nanoemulsion showcased higher Cmax of NFV (9.75 ± 1.23 μg/mL) and EGCG (27.7 ± 1.22 μg/mL) in the brain, along with NFV (26.44 ± 1.44 μg/mL) and EGCG (313.20 ± 5.53 μg/mL) in the plasma. This study advocates for the potential of NFV and EGCG-loaded nanoemulsion in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for effective NeuroAIDS management."

      "abstract": "This study designed to investigate the potential effects of rosemary oil on oxidative stress markers in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The rats divided into four groups such as control group, rosemary group, diabetes group and diabetes + rosemary group. Blood samples were analyzed to assess with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay various parameters including malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), super oxide dismutase (SOD). Insulin and glucose levels were also determined through autoanalyzer. The results indicated significant increase in MDA levels and significant decrease in GSH and SOD levels in the diabetes group. Following the administration of rosemary oil to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, a significant decrease in MDA level and significant increase in GSH and SOD levels was observed in comparison to the diabetes group. In the research, rats induced with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were displayed notably lower insulin levels compared to the control group, accompanied by significantly higher glucose levels. Upon the administration of rosemary oil to these diabetic rats, there was marked amelioration in insulin and glucose levels compared to the untreated diabetic group. These findings collectively suggest that the utilization of rosemary oil in diabetic rats potentially have positive effects on oxidative stress markers, indicating its promising role as a therapeutic intervention in diabetic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Atazanavir or ATV is an FDA-approved, HIV-1 protease inhibitor that belongs to the azapeptide group. Over time, it has been observed that ATV can cause multiple adverse side effects in the form of liver diseases including elevations in serum aminotransferase, indirect hyper-bilirubinemia, and idiosyncratic acute liver injury aggravating the underlying chronic viral hepatitis. Hence, there is an incessant need to explore the safe and efficacious method of delivering ATV in a controlled manner that may reduce the proportion of its idiosyncratic reactions in patients who are on antiretroviral therapy for years. In this study, we assessed ATV formulation along with Rosemary oil to enhance the anti-HIV-1 activity and its controlled delivery through self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system or SNEDDS to enhance its oral bioavailability. While the designing, development, and characterization of ATV-SNEDDS were addressed through various evaluation parameters and pharmacokinetic-based studies, in vitro cell-based experiments assured the safety and efficacy of the designed ATV formulation. The study discovered the potential of ATV-SNEDDS to inhibit HIV-1 infection at a lower concentration as compared to its pure counterpart. Simultaneously, we could also demonstrate the ATV and Rosemary oil providing leads for designing and developing such formulations for the management of HIV-1 infections with the alleviation in the risk of adverse reactions.",

      "abstract": "The pervasiveness of fungal infections is an issue for skin health globally, and there are a reported 40 million cases in developed and developing countries. Novel drug delivery systems provide better therapeutic efficacy over conventional drug therapy due to their lower side effects and toxicity. Furthermore, combinations of essential oils can represent alternative therapies for fungal infections that are resistant to synthetic drugs. This study is aimed at developing Timur oil into a nanoemulgel and evaluating its antifungal effects. The development of the formulation involved the preparation of a nanoemulsion by the titration method, followed by its evaluation for various physicochemical properties. The antifungal activity of the nanoemulgel against Candida albicans was evaluated. The zone of inhibition was determined using the disk diffusion method. The results show that the developed nanoemulgel has a particle size of 139 ± 6.11 nm, a PDI of 0.309, and a zeta potential of -19.12 ± 2.73 mV. An in vitro drug release study showed a sustained release of 70 ± 0.289% of the drug over a period of 24 h. The % drug permeation across the skin was found to be 79.11 ± 0.319% over 24 h. However, the amount of drug retained in the skin was 56.45 µg/g. The flux for the nanoemulgel was found to be 94.947 µg/cm2/h, indicating a better permeability profile. The nanoemulgel formulation showed a zone of inhibition of 15 ± 2.45 mm, whereas the 1% ketoconazole cream (marketed preparation) exhibited a zone of inhibition of 13 ± 2.13 mm. The results of this study suggest that developed nanoemulgel containing Timur oil and rosemary oil has the potential to be used for treating topical fungal infections caused by Candida albicans."

      "abstract": "Essential oils possessing antimicrobial characteristics have acquired considerable interest as an alternative to chemical preservatives in food products. This research hypothesizes that mānuka (MO) and kānuka (KO) oils may possess antimicrobial characteristics and have the potential to be used as natural preservatives for food applications. Initial experimentation was conducted to characterize MOs (with 5, 25, and 40% triketone contents), rosemary oil (RO) along with kanuka oil (KO) for their antibacterial efficacy against selected Gram-negative (Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli), and Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria through disc diffusion and broth dilution assays. All MOs showed a higher antimicrobial effect against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration below 0.04%, compared with KO (0.63%) and RO (2.5%). In chemical composition, α-pinene in KO, 1, 8 cineole in RO, calamenene, and leptospermone in MO were the major compounds, confirmed through Gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Further, the antimicrobial effect of MO and RO in vacuum-packed beef pastes prepared from New Zealand commercial breed (3% fat) and wagyu (12% fat) beef tenderloins during 16 days of refrigerated storage was compared with sodium nitrate (SN) and control (without added oil). In both meat types, compared with the SN-treated and control samples, lower growth of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in MO- and RO- treated samples was observed. However, for Salmonella and E. coli, RO treatment inhibited microbial growth most effectively. The results suggest the potential use of MO as a partial replacement for synthetic preservatives like sodium nitrate in meats, especially against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus."

The enrichment of minimally processed potatoes with aromatic compounds could represent an interesting method for product innovation. This study was aimed at applying VI with rosemary essential oil on a minimally processed potato product in order to obtain an innovative fresh-cut potato product, and to evaluate its influence on the physico-chemical, sensorial and microbiological properties of potato sticks during refrigerated storage and after frying. A pressure of 60 mbar was applied for 30 min followed by a relaxation time at atmospheric pressure of 30 min to potato sticks immersed in rosemary oil solutions in concentration between 0 and 12%. Prepared samples were packed and stored at 4 °C for 14 days. Analytical determinations were carried out on the fresh and fried product. The weight gain of potatoes promoted by VI was in the range of 6-14%, depending on the concentration of rosemary essential oil. The rosemary essential oil concentration gradients of impregnated potato sticks were detected by GC analysis and sensorial test, evidencing their persistency during storage and after frying. The treatment seemed to improve microbiological stability, not affecting the texture, moisture, but slightly deteriorating the product color. Results obtained in the present study confirm the potentiality of VI for fresh products innovation."

In this study, the aim is to investigate whether rosemary oil (RO) has a protective effect on HS-induced damage in spermatozoa production, testicular histologic structures, apoptosis, and androgenic receptor (AR) through lipid peroxidation mechanisms in growing Japanese quail. Male chicks (n=90) at 15-days of age were assigned to two groups. The first group (n=45) was kept in a thermo-neutral (TN) room at 22°C for 24h/d. The second group (n=45) was kept in a room with a greater ambient temperature of 34°C for 8h/d (from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and 22°C for 16h/d. Animals in each of these two groups were randomly assigned to three subgroups (RO groups: 0, 125, 250ppm), consisting of 15 chicks (six treatment groups in 2×3 factorial design). Each of subgroups was replicated three times with each replicate including five chicks. The HS treatment significantly reduced the testicular spermatogenic cell counts, amount of testicular Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic marker) and amount of AR. In addition, it significantly increased testicular lipid peroxidation, Bax (apoptotic marker) immunopositive staining, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in conjunction with some histopathologic damage. Dietary supplementation of RO to diets of quail where the HS treatment was imposed alleviated HS-induced almost all negative changes such as increased testicular lipid peroxidation, decreased numbers of spermatogenic cells, and decreased amounts of Bcl-2 and AR, increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and some testicular histopathologic lesion. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of RO for growing male Japanese quail reared in HS environmental conditions alleviates the HS-induced structural and functional damage by providing a decrease in lipid peroxidation.",

The efficacy of the volatiles of oils at various concentrations in reducing Listeria monocytogenes as well as the release of the oils from the MFS have been also determined in this study. The cheese, inoculated with a cocktail of 5 strains of L. monocytogenes (approximately 3 log CFU/g), was packaged in a Nylon/EVOH/PE bag. A paper sachet containing MFS embedded with rosemary oil and thyme oil, separately or together, was inserted into the bag. Rosemary and thyme oil volatiles released from the sachet restricted the growth of L. monocytogenes, resulting in a 2.5 log CFU/g reduction on day 9 at 10 °C. The volatile oils also showed inhibitory effects on the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and total aerobic bacteria (TAB). After 15 d at 10 °C, the numbers of LAB and TAB in the samples containing the sachet with both oils experienced a 1.2 and 1.4 log CFU/g reduction, respectively, compared to untreated samples. Nonetheless, the sachet treatment produced a distinct odor, unfavorably received by the panelists. The results suggest the potential for application of the sachet system for the reduction of growth of L. monocytogenes, LAB, and TAB in food products.",

This study investigates the effects of the inhalation of rosemary oil on test subjects' feelings, as well as its effects on various physiological parameters of the nervous system. Twenty healthy volunteers participated in the experiment. All subjects underwent autonomic nervous system (ANS) recording. This consisted of measurements of skin temperature; heart rate; respiratory rate; blood pressure; evaluations of the subjects' mood states; and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in the pre-, during treatment, and post-rosemary inhalation periods as compared with control conditions. Our results showed significant increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate after rosemary oil inhalation. After the inhalation treatments, subjects were found to have become more active and stated that they felt \"fresher\". The analysis of EEGs showed a reduction in the power of alpha1 (8-10.99 Hz) and alpha2 (11-12.99 Hz) waves. Moreover, an increment in the beta wave (13-30 Hz) power was observed in the anterior region of the brain. These results confirm the stimulatory effects of rosemary oil and provide supporting evidence that brain wave activity, autonomic nervous system activity, as well as mood states are all affected by the inhalation of the rosemary oil."

Thus, a shelf-life extension of 7-8 and >11days was obtained for T-RO and T-CH, and T-CH-RO turkey samples, respectively. The presence of chitosan in T-CH and T-CH-RO samples did not negatively influence the taste of cooked turkey meat.",

      "abstract": "The effects of three concentrations (0.2%, 1% and 3%) of rosemary oil (RO) on the freshness indicators, oxidative stability, fatty acid and biogenic amine (BA) contents of minced rainbow trout muscle (MTM) were investigated after different periods of storage (three and nine days) at 4 ± 1 °C. Moreover, the terpene and sesquiterpene contents in the treated MTM were also measured. RO treatment improves the pH, oxidative stability of the lipids and the FA profile, which resulted in a significant extension of MTM shelf-life. Storage time influenced all freshness indicators, with the exception of yellowness and chroma. Treatment with RO had a positive effect, leading to low BA content, especially putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine and histamine. Differences in BA were also found to be due to storage time, with the exception of spermidine, which was not influenced by time. Moreover, the presence of the terpenoid fraction of RO in MTM improved the quality of this ready-to-cook fish food."
