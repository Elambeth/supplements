      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Vernix caseosa peritonitis (VCP) is a rare complication that typically presents following an otherwise uneventful cesarean section. Leakage of vernix caseosa into the peritoneum is thought to elicit a granulomatous foreign body reaction. Symptoms can be similar to other acute abdominal conditions, and diagnosis is confirmed by intraoperative findings and histological examination. Peritoneal lavage with supportive measures is the mainstay of treatment and recovery. CASE REPORT Case 1 was a 30-year-old woman who developed right iliac fossa pain, fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea less than a week after her lower segment cesarean section (LSCS). She underwent a laparoscopy for a peritonitic abdomen and concern for intra-abdominal sepsis. A peritoneal biopsy demonstrated histological changes consistent with VCP. Case 2 was a 39-year-old woman who underwent a LSCS. After discharge, she re-presented with generalized abdominal pain. With computed tomography (CT) scan findings suggestive of appendicitis, an appendectomy was performed, and vernix caseosa was detected in all quadrants. Case 3 was a 33-year-old woman who presented with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and iliac fossa pain 9 days following an LSCS. She was given analgesia and antibiotics for a pelvic fluid collection noted on CT scan. She re-presented with tense swelling and pain above her cesarean section incision. Laparoscopy revealed adhesions over the lower abdomen and pelvis and white plaques suggestive of vernix caseosa along the peritoneal side walls. CONCLUSIONS The rising incidence of cesarean births worldwide creates the potential for increased numbers of VCP cases. Greater recognition of VCP is warranted to prevent unnecessary procedures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The stratum corneum (SC) is the outermost layer of human skin and deemed as barrier against chemical exposure and water loss. Moisturizers have beneficial effects in treating dry skin, especially the SC. Confocal Raman spectroscopy (CRS) was used to evaluate the efficacy of moisturizers on skin hydration and penetration, with such agents posing inherent characteristics of being noninvasive, nondestructive, timesaving, and cost effective. Bionics vernix caseosa (BVC) cream mimics the composition of vernix caseosa (VC), which could protect the newborn skin. METHODS: This research applied CRS to evaluate the penetration depth and water content variation during the intervention with two moisturizers, BVC cream and Vaseline. Volunteers received the 2 h application of BVC cream and Vaseline on the forearms. The evaluations on 0 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h were performed clinical assessment. Experimental data was processed by least square method and analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The penetration depth of Vaseline was deeper than that of Bionics vernix caseosa cream. Specifically, BVC cream penetrated 18 μm into human skin, while Vaseline penetrated at least 20 μm. Compared with Vaseline, only BVC cream increased skin hydration, with a moisturizing effect lasting for 4 h. At 6 h, the Vaseline moisturizing effect decreased significantly.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vernix caseosa peritonitis (VCP) is a rare peripartum complication secondary to the introduction of fetal vernix into the maternal peritoneal cavity. Vernix caseosa peritonitis typically manifests a few hours to days after a cesarian section and is often initially misdiagnosed as a more common disease process resulting in delayed diagnosis. We report the computed tomography (CT) findings in 2 patients with VCP and reviewed the previously reported CT findings of VCP. CASES: Two patients, aged 17 and 24 years, presented with signs and symptoms of peritonitis within days of undergoing a cesarian section. In both cases, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated ascites and multiple small, well-defined, peripherally enhancing, cystic peritoneal nodules which were most prominent around the liver and became larger and more numerous over time. Antibiotic therapy was not effective, subsequent laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy demonstrated VCP, and patients were successfully treated with lavage and the addition of intravenous steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Vernix caseosa peritonitis is an underrecognized disorder that is most often mistaken for other more common causes of peritonitis. In the setting of peripartum peritonitis, the CT findings of ascites with multiple small, well-defined, peripherally enhancing, cystic peritoneal nodules, especially adjacent to the liver, which grow in size and number strongly suggests VCP.",

Here, we used a ceramide containing vernix caseosa (VC)-based formulation and were able to accelerate barrier recovery in healthy volunteers. The recovery was examined over 16 days by monitoring trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) after barrier disruption by tape-stripping. Four skin sites were used to examine the effects of both treatment and barrier recovery. After 16 days, samples were harvested at these sites to examine the SC ceramide composition and lipid organization. Changes in ceramide profiles were identified using principal component analysis. After barrier recovery, the untreated sites showed increased levels of ceramide subclass AS and ceramides with a 34 total carbon-atom chain length, while the mean ceramide chain length was reduced. These changes were diminished by treatment with the studied formulation, which concurrently increased the formulated ceramides. Correlations were observed between SC lipid composition, lipid organization, and TEWL, and changes in the ceramide subclass composition suggest changes in the ceramide biosynthesis. These results suggest that VC-based formulations enhance skin barrier recovery and are attractive candidates to treat skin disorders with impaired barrier properties.",

      "abstract": "Although vernix caseosa is known to be a natural biofilm at birth, human pulmonary surfactant commences to remove the vernix from fetal skin into the amniotic fluid at gestational week 34, i.e., well before delivery. To explain this paradox, we first produced two types of fluorescently labeled liposomes displaying morphology similar to that of pulmonary surfactant and vernix caseosa complexes. We then continuously administered these liposomes into the amniotic fluid space of pregnant rabbits. In addition, we produced pulmonary surfactant and vernix caseosa complexes and administered them into the amniotic fluid space of pregnant rabbits. The intra-amniotic infused fluorescently labeled liposomes were absorbed into the fetal intestinal epithelium. However, the liposomes were not transported to the livers of fetal rabbits. We also revealed that continuous administration of micelles derived from pulmonary surfactants and vernix caseosa protected the small intestine of the rabbit fetus from damage due to surgical intervention. Our results indicate that pulmonary surfactant and vernix caseosa complexes in swallowed amniotic fluid might locally influence fetal intestinal enterocytes. Although the present studies are primarily observational and further studies are needed, our findings elucidate the physiological interactions among pulmonary, dermal-epidermal, and gastrointestinal developmental processes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Premature infants lack the vernix caseosa, have an incompetent stratum corneum (SC) barrier and are predisposed to infection. Use of topical agents to improve barrier function has had mixed outcomes. The aim was to determine the effect of vernix versus common barrier creams on the rate and quality of the epidermal barrier repair following controlled wounding. METHODS: Minor wounds were created with (1) laser ablation in the minipig and (2) tape stripping of mother's volar skin as a model for premature skin. Native vernix was applied to the mother's tape-stripped skin. Treatments were no occlusion (NO), vernix and a petrolatum-based cream (PBC) in the pig, and NO, vernix, PBC, an oil-in-water cream (OWC), a semipermeable film (SP) and full occlusion (FO) in adults. RESULTS: Outcomes for both trials were barrier recovery and skin hydration (moisture accumulation rate, MAT), initial hydration, erythema and dryness in adults. Vernix and PBC produced greater barrier repair than NO in the pig. SP produced greater recovery than NO and FO in adults. Vernix yielded greater recovery than FO and was similar to PBC, OWC and NO. Vernix had a directionally higher MAT than OWC and directionally higher initial hydration than NO. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that vernix-based topical creams would be effective for the treatment of epidermal wounds and show promise to augment SC repair and maturation in infants.",

Each had a protracted course with significant comorbidities requiring surgical and medical intervention. This contrasts with other reports suggesting that a rapid resolution can be expected.This cluster may be a consequence of the rising caesarean section rate, a heightened local awareness of the condition and possibly a result of leaving material in the paracolic gutters intraoperatively. CONCLUSION: Our aim is to increase awareness among our obstetric and surgical colleagues of the characteristic clinical presentation and intra-operative findings of vernix caseosa peritonitis. We also point out that, in contrast to those presented here, not all patients require laparotomy."

VC was selected as its wound healing properties were suggested previously, but never clearly demonstrated. Five different levels of barrier disruption in mice, accomplished by tape-stripping, were evaluated. Disruption models such as moderate, severe #1 and #2 (transepidermal water loss (TEWL) of 31 +/- 2, 59 +/- 4 and 66 +/- 3 g/m(2)/h, respectively) showed complete recovery within 72 h. However, not all corneocytes were removed after tape-stripping. Additionally, models such as severe #3 and #4 (TEWL of 73 +/- 5 and 79 +/- 6 g/m(2)/h, respectively) with a more severe disruption were evaluated. After tape-stripping, all corneocytes were removed and the remaining epidermis was intact. However, model #3 still showed complete recovery within 72 h. With model #4, a crust was formed and almost complete recovery (approximately 90%) was obtained within only 8 days. The effect of VC application on recovery of disrupted skin was evaluated with model #3 and #4. Model #3 showed that application of VC predominantly influenced initial recovery and is therefore merely appropriate to study the effect of formulations in the initial recovery period. Topical application of VC on model #4 considerably increased initial and long-term recovery. Moreover, VC application promoted rapid formation of stratum corneum and prevented epidermal thickening. These observations not only confirm the ability of VC to enhance barrier recovery, but also suggest potential use of this treatment clinically.",

As VC shows multiple protecting and barrier supporting properties before and after birth, it is suggested that a VC substitute could be an innovative barrier cream for barrier deficient skin. Lanolin was selected as the source of the branched chain sterol esters and wax esters--the main lipid classes of VC. Different lipid fractions were isolated from lanolin and subsequently mixed with squalene, triglycerides, cholesterol, ceramides and fatty acids to generate semi-synthetic lipid mixtures that mimic the lipid composition of VC, as established by high-performance thin-layer chromatography. Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy investigations revealed that triglycerides play an important role in the (lateral) lipid organization and thermotropic behaviour of the synthetic lipid mixtures. Excellent resemblance of VC lipids was obtained when adding unsaturated triglycerides. Moreover, these lipid mixtures showed similar long range ordering as VC. The optimal lipid mixture was evaluated on tape-stripped hairless mouse skin in vivo. The rate of barrier recovery was increased and comparable to VC lipid treatment.",

      "abstract": "A naturally occurring barrier cream, vernix caseosa, is the viscous material synthesized by the sebaceous glands in the late gestational human fetus. Vernix functions as a moisturizer by increasing the skin hydration and water-holding capacity of treated skin. Vernix films are semi-permeable, i.e., in the range that facilitates barrier repair. Antioxidant, disinfectant, and skin cleansing functions are also present. Premature infants have a markedly immature epidermal barrier and the excessive water loss can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, along with high evaporative heat loss. Application of petrolatum-based, low-water creams on these infants has decreased TEWL and improved the skin condition. However, in infants of 500-750 g, this treatment was associated with an increased incidence of late-onset nosocomial infection, and questions regarding efficacy and safety have been raised. The water-handling properties, semi-permeability and multi-functionality, suggest that application of vernix may promote the development and restoration of premature or other compromised skin. The present study focuses on the development of barrier creams to simulate the water-handling properties of native vernix. Barrier creams were prepared as high-water-phase emulsions containing various lipid mixtures. Several stable creams with high water content exhibited slow water release and water vapor transport rates in the range to facilitate barrier repair. The results showed the importance of emulsion type in preventing water release. Preparations with vernix-like lipids demonstrated water release profiles closer to the native vernix benchmark than those with conventional lipids. The work resulted in a synthetic vernix barrier cream prototype for evaluation on skin and to which additional functionality, e.g., anti-infective and antioxidant activity, could be added.",

      "abstract": "Vernix caseosa peritonitis (VCP) is a rare and serious complication of caesarean section. It is thought to occur as a result of spillage of amniotic fluid and or meconium into the maternal peritoneal cavity at caesarean section. It manifests as an acute abdomen days to weeks after a seemingly uncomplicated caesarean section. Only 18 cases have been reported in the literature and all but one are from the USA. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood. In the past, the management of VCP included a laparotomy and removal of suspected abdominal organs which were invariably found to be normal on histopathological examination. However, the characteristic intraoperative finding was a cheesy white exudate that coats the visceral organs. The organs themselves were not inflamed. Histological examination of biopsy specimen of the cheesy exudates is the only way to make a diagnosis of VCP. This would reveal anucleate squamous cells along with lanugo hair and foreign body giant cell reaction. From recent case reports, peritoneal lavage appears to be the mainstay of treatment of VCP. Increased awareness of this condition is crucial so that it is considered in the differential diagnosis of post-caesarean acute abdomen thereby avoiding the unnecessary removal of healthy intra-abdominal organs. This review article summarises the current state of knowledge on VCP.",

      "abstract": "The application of occlusive films and oil-in-oil ointments has been reported to improve epidermal barrier function in very low birthweight, preterm infants. Such infants have a structurally immature stratum corneum and lack a surface coating of vernix caseosa. In this study we examined the short-term effects of topical application of vernix caseosa to human skin and contrasted these effects with commonly used ointments and water-in-oil emulsions. Specifically, vernix, Eucerin(R), Aquaphor(R), and petrolatum were applied to the volar skin surface of adult volunteers. Surface electrical capacitance (SEC) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured as indices of surface hydration. Sorption-desorption profiles were performed to determine skin surface hydrophobicity. Particular attention was given to monitoring the acute (0-120 minutes) changes following vernix treatment in order to compare these effects with earlier reports on the rate of skin surface drying in newborn infants following birth. Immediately after vernix application there was an increase in the rate of water loss from the skin surface. Relative to control skin and skin treated with the ointments and water-in-oil emulsions, the application of vernix to freshly bathed human skin resulted in a unique profile of temporal change in baseline surface hydration, moisture accumulation, and water-holding capacity. These results demonstrate major differences between human vernix and standard oil-based topical ointments. The results provide a framework for discussing the various properties of topical barriers applied to the very low birthweight infant.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vernix caseosa peritonitis is a rare complication of cesarean section with distinctive histopathologic findings. CASE: Vernix caseosa peritonitis occurred in a 28-year-old, pregnant woman following emergency cesarean section. Exploratory laparotomy revealed right subphrenic and perihepatic fluid collections with multiple small abdominal abscesses. Cytopathologic examination of the peritoneal lavage specimen showed a purulent inflammatory exudate admixed with occasional squamous debris, portions of hair shafts, meconium pigment, and foamy and multinucleated giant cells. During hospitalization the patient had developed Clostridium perfringens acute endometritis, presumably due to aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Pathologists are in a unique position to make the correct diagnosis in an otherwise-ambiguous clinical presentation because of the distinctive histopathologic and cytopathologic findings of this entity. Computed tomography-guided fine needle aspiration cytologic evaluation can be diagnostic in such cases.",

This rare form of peritonitis is caused by the spillage of vernix caseosa material into the peritoneal cavity. The exact mechanism of the development of peritonitis in these few cases is unknown. Clinically, vernix caseosa peritonitis should be considered in the post-cesarean section acute abdomen after excluding the more common causes of peritonitis such as appendicitis and perforated viscus. Intraoperatively, the presence of cheese-like yellow patches limited to the serosal layer of visceral organs is the most characteristic feature. Histopathological examination of these serosal patches reveal the desquamated anuclear squamous cells confirming the diagnosis. Postoperative treatment with antibiotics should be continued. The addition of steroids (only after confirming the diagnosis pathologically) has a significant effect on improving the clinical outcome.",
