      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The emergence of foodborne multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella has attracted considerable global attention. Given that food is the primary transmission route, our study focuses on Bellamya quadrata, a freshwater snail that is commonly consumed as a specialty food in Guangxi, China. METHODS: Eight MDR Salmonella strains were isolated from Bellamya quadrata samples collected across various markets. Previous animal experiments have confirmed their lethality in mice. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) and star anise essential oil (SAEO) using the microdilution plate and checkerboard methods. The time-kill curve method was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of the cinnamon-star anise essential oil (SCEO) against planktonic MDR Salmonella. The alkaline phosphatase assay and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that SCEO causes damage to bacterial cell walls and membranes. Crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe changes in biofilms after SCEO treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to analyze the expression of genes related to biofilm formation following SCEO treatment. RESULTS: The MIC of SAEO was determined to be 25 mg/mL, whereas that of CEO was significantly lower at 0.62 mg/mL. The FIC index calculated was 0.375, which suggests a synergistic interaction between the two. When SCEO was used in combination at specific ratios, it demonstrated enhanced antibacterial and anti-biofilm capabilities compared to the individual effects of CEO or SAEO, potentially through the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and cell walls. However, in Salmonella treated with SCEO, an upregulation in the expression of biofilm-associated genes was observed, including csgA, adrA, bcsA, and csgD. This increase may be attributed to stress-induced transcriptional responses within the bacteria. DISCUSSION: SCEO significantly impacts cell wall integrity, suggesting its crucial role in reducing biofilm formation. These findings indicate that SCEO holds potential as an alternative to traditional antibiotics and merits further scientific investigation and development.",

METHODS: A total of 40 pregnant sows were housed in individual stalls and allocated into two treatment groups using a completely randomized design based on body weight, backfat thickness, and parity. The treatments consisted of either 0% or 0.1% SA supplementation during late gestation and lactation. Following the lactation period, 160 weaning piglets were used to investigate the imprinting effects of SA. The dietary treatment was continued in a manner that the piglets received the same diet as their litter. Data collected included serum antioxidant status in sows, milk composition, and stress markers in piglets, which were measured at various stages. RESULTS: Sows fed with SA during late gestation exhibited significantly higher serum total antioxidant status (p < 0.03). Additionally, SA supplementation increased lactose content in the milk (p < 0.01). Piglets from sows fed the SA diet during late gestation showed lower serum cortisol and epinephrine concentrations at weaning (p < 0.01, p < 0.04, respectively). SA supplementation during lactation further reduced serum cortisol levels in weaning piglets at a day after weaning (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current experiment indicated that supplementing dietary SA in gestation and lactation diet showed higher serum antioxidant properties in sows and improved the quality of sow milk, consequently enhancing litter performance."

      "abstract": "The research study aimed to maximize the important medical role of star anise extract (SAE) through its loading on a widely available natural polymer (chitosan, Cs). Thus, SAE loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) was prepared. The finding illustrated the formation of spherical particles of SAE loaded CsNPs as proved by transmission electron microscope (TEM). In addition, the average particle size of CsNPs and SAE loaded CsNPs are 131.8 ± 24.63 and 318.5 ± 73.94 nm, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed the presence of many spherical particles deposited on the surface of CsNPs owing to the deposition of SAE on the surface and encapsulated into pores of CsNPs. It also showed the presence of elements such as sodium, potassium, copper, magnesium, zinc, calcium, and iron, as well as the elements that accompanied with CsNPs: carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The extract was rich in bioactive components, such as anethole, shikimic acid, and different flavonoids, contributing to its medicinal qualities. The bioactive molecules in SAE were assessed by chromatographic analysis. Using the agar well diffusion test, the antibacterial qualities of CsNPs and SAE loaded CsNPs were evaluated against pathogenic bacteria linked to lung illnesses. The most significant inhibition zones showed that the SAE loaded CsNPs had the most antibacterial activity. The anticancer activity using MTT assay was used in the biological assessments to determine the cytotoxicity against the NCl-H460 lung cancer cell line. The results showed that CsNPs loaded with SAE considerably decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with the most significant anticancer impact by SAE loaded CsNPs. Furthermore, in vivo tests on lung cancer therapy revealed that when compared to other treatment groups, the SAE loaded CsNPs group showed the greatest reduction in tumor biomarkers and inflammation, as seen by decreased levels of Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor protein 53 (p53), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- alpha), and fibronectin. Results concluded that these thorough characterizations, biological assessments, and antibacterial tests have confirmed the effective integration of SAE into CsNPs. Further, SAE loaded CsNPs could be a suitable option for various biomedical applications in tackling lung cancer and the inactivation of bacterial infection.",

The vitamins flavoured nanophytosomes (VFnPs) were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency. Ice cream was flavoured with star anise volatile oil to mask the VFnPs' flavour and unacceptable taste. The study found that treatment with CsA alone resulted in increased (P > 0.05) levels of creatinine, urea, and MDA, as well as the activities of AST and ALT, while the levels of SOD, CAT, GST, proteins, CD4, INF-ᵧ, IL-6, IL-1β, and TLR4 decreased (P > 0.05). However, the group that received CsA simultaneously with VFnPs showed a significant (P > 0.05) decrease in the levels of creatinine, urea, and MDA, as well as the activities of AST and ALT, and increased (P > 0.05) levels of SOD, CAT, GST, proteins, CD4, INF-ᵧ, IL-6, IL-1β, and TLR4. The increase in the ratio of VFnPs had little effect on the physiochemical and sensory evaluation of the ice cream. Finally, the study suggests that VFnPs could potentially protect against CsA-induced liver and kidney injury and serve as a promising natural therapy for treating such conditions."

      "abstract": "Long-term use of the nitroimidazole-derived antibiotic metronidazole has been associated with neuronal damage due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Polyphenol-rich plants, such as anise seeds and clove buds, are suggested to have neuroprotective effects. However, their intracellular protective pathway against metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the potential neuroprotective benefits of anise seeds and clove buds and elucidate the proposed metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity mechanism. This study divided rats into six groups, each containing six rats. In Group I, the control group, rats were administered saline orally. Group II rats received 200 mg/kg of metronidazole orally. Group III rats received 250 mg/kg b.w. of anise seed extract and metronidazole. Group IV rats received 500 mg/kg b.w. of anise seed extract (administered orally) and metronidazole. Group V rats received 250 mg/kg b.w. of clove bud extract (administered orally) and metronidazole. Group VI rats were administered 500 mg/kg b.w. of clove bud extract and metronidazole daily for 30 consecutive days. The study evaluated the phenolic compounds of anise seeds and clove buds. Moreover, it assessed the inflammatory and antioxidant indicators and neurotransmitter activity in brain tissues. A histological examination of the brain tissues was conducted to identify neuronal degeneration, brain antioxidants, and apoptotic mRNA expression. The study found that metronidazole treatment significantly altered antioxidant levels, inflammatory mediators, and structural changes in brain tissue. Metronidazole also induced apoptosis in brain tissue and escalated the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Oral administration of metronidazole resulted in a decrease in GABA, dopamine, and serotonin and an increase in ACHE in brain tissue. Conversely, oral administration of anise and clove extracts mitigated the harmful effects of metronidazole. The neurotoxic effects of metronidazole appear to stem from its ability to reduce antioxidants in brain tissue and increase nitric oxide production and apoptosis. The study concludes that neuronal damage caused by metronidazole is significantly mitigated by treatment with anise and clove extracts."

      "abstract": "Because star anise is underutilized in the baking sector and the antifungal targets are unclear, this study aimed to investigate the antifungal effect and mechanism of star anise extract (SAE) on spoilage fungi in bread. SAE was prepared by ethanol extraction and 31 substances were identified by GC-MS, among which trans-anethole (62.62%), estragole (7.82%) and linalool (4.66%) were the major components. The antifungal activity of SAE and the three main components against Penicillium roqueforti and Aspergillus niger were determined by using the Oxford cup method and the sesqui-dilution method. The inhibition zones were 9.88 mm and 15.09 mm, while the minimum inhibitory concentrations were 125.00 μL/mL and 31.25 μL/mL. Trans-anethole and estragole both showed antifungal activity against Penicillium roqueforti and Aspergillus niger, while linalool only showed antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger. Propidium iodide and fluorescein diacetate staining analysis, leakage of cellular components (nucleic acids and proteins) and rise in ergosterol content indicated that SAE disrupted the integrity and permeability of the cell membrane. Malondialdehyde was increased after SAE treatment, indicating that SAE caused lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane, further confirming that it disrupted the cell membrane. At the same time, SAE interacted with membrane proteins and altered their conformation, resulting in cell membrane dysfunction. Finally, the shelf life test showed that SAE extended the shelf life of the bread by up to 6 days. In general, this study highlights the antifungal effect of SAE against Penicillium roqueforti and Aspergillus niger, which indicated that SAE can be used as an antifungal agent to extend the shelf life of bread.",

      "abstract": "Star anise (Illicium verum) is an important economic and medical plant widely cultivated in Guangxi province, China. Its fruit can be used as spice and medicine (Wang et al. 2011). In recent years, anthracnose led to a serious decline in the production of star anise in Guangxi. In 2021, a survey conducted in CenwangLaoshan Reserve of Guangxi (24°21'N; 106°27'E) showed that the 2500 ha planting area had disease incidence greater than 80%. The leaf symptoms initially appeared as small spots, then expanded to round spots, finally becoming withered with grayish-white centers, surrounded by dark brown margins. Sometimes, small black acervuli were observed in the later stage. To explore the pathogen, infected leaves were collected and cut into small pieces (about 5 mm2) from the edge of the lesion, disinfected with 75% ethanol for 10 s, 1% NaClO for 1 min, washed with sterilized water and incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 28 °C in the dark. Ten single-spore isolates were obtained from the cultures. After 7 days on PDA at 28 °C, the colonies of 7 isolates were white with abundant aerial hyphae, gray-black with white-gray margins, and the other 3 isolates were light gray on the upper surface, and pink or orange on the underside. Representative isolates BS3-4 and BS3-1 were selected from 3 isolates and 7 isolates, respectively. Conidia of BS3-4 and BS3-1 were both hyaline, cylindrical, aseptate, smooth, apex obtuse, base truncate, and no significant differences (P > 0.05) in size between BS3-1 (13.22 to 5.38 × 3.89 to 1.99 μm) (n = 50) and BS3-4 (12.04 to 4.34 × 3.48 to 1.64 μm) (n = 50). These morphological characteristics were consistent with the Colletotrichum ssp. (Damm et al. 2012). The species identification of BS3-4 and BS3-1 was performed based on DNA sequence analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted as a template. Partial sequences of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin gene (ACT), β-tubulin2 (TUB2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified and sequenced (Weir et al. 2012). The sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS:OQ062642-43; ACT:OQ067614-15; GAPDH:OQ067616-17;TUB2：OQ067618-19). Based on the concatenated sequences of the 4 genes (ITS-ACT- GAPDH -TUB2) of BS3-4 and BS3-1 as well as sequences of other Colletotrichum spp. obtained from GenBank, the Maximum likelihood (ML) tree which produced with IQ-TREE (Minh et al. 2020) revealed that the isolate BS3-1 was Colletotrichum horii, and BS3-4 was Colletotrichum fioriniae. Pathogenicity was confirmed on healthy leaves of 1-year-old star anise seedlings (cultivar Dahong), and the leaves were wounded by sterilized toothpicks, and were inoculated with 10 µl of conidial suspensions of BS3-1 and BS3-4 (106 conidia/ml). Control seedlings were inoculated with sterilized distilled water. Five leaves per plant and 3 plants per treatment were selected. All inoculated seedlings were maintained in the greenhouse (12/12h light/dark, 25 ± 2℃, 90% relative humidity). Wound sites inoculated with BS3-1 and BS3-4 both turned greenish-brown after 2 days and then turned light brown with water-soaked spots. Black (BS3-1) or orange (BS3-4) dots of acervuli developed after 6 days. The lesion diameter of BS3-1 (14.4 mm) was larger than that of BS3-4 (8.1 mm). No symptoms were observed on controls. BS3-1 and BS3-4 were re-isolated from inoculated leaves, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Anthracnose of star anise caused by C.horii has been reported in China (Liao et al. 2017). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of C.fioriniae infecting star anise in China. Accurate pathogen identification in this study could provide a reference for the control of anthracnose on star anise."

METHODS: A total of 150 21-day-old crossbred weaned pigs [(Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc] were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. All pigs were randomly assigned to 3 groups based on the initial body weight (6.19 ± 0.29 kg). Each group had 10 replicate pens with 5 pigs (three barrows and two gilts) per pen. The experimental period was 42 days and consisted of 3 phases (phase 1, days 1-7; phase 2, days 8-21; phase 3, days 22-42). Dietary treatments were based on a corn-soybean meal-basal diet and supplemented with 0.000, 0.075, or 0.150% TA. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found that dietary supplementation of graded levels of TA linearly improved body weight, body weight gain, average daily feed intake, and feed efficiency (P < 0.05). TA supplementation also had positive effects on apparent dry matter, crude protein, and energy digestibility (P < 0.05) and jejunal villus height (P < 0.05). The emission of ammonia from feces decreased linearly with the dose of TA increased (P < 0.05). Moreover, TA supplementation was capable to regulate the fecal microbiota diversity, manifesting in a linearly increased Chao1 index and observed species and a linearly decreased Pielou's index (P < 0.05). The abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Clostridium butyricum were increased, while the abundance of Prevotella copri was decreased, by treatment (P < 0.05). Therefore, we speculated that TA supplementation would improve growth performance and reduce fecal ammonia emission through improving nutrient digestibility, which was attributed to the increase of jejunal villus height and the regulation of fecal microbiota."

      "abstract": "Lernaea cyprinacea infestation is considered a serious economic problem in the fish market. An assessment to control this parasite is needed to manage this problem. The Illicium verum oil extract has considerable antioxidant activity and scavenges 96.22% of free radicals; the high antioxidant activity refers to the phenolic content presence. The extract contains minerals, especially K, fibers, and dry matter. So, the Illicium verum ingredients were tested against this copepod for in vitro and in vivo investigation with the assessment of the treatment trial using a scanning electron microscope and evaluating the change in different immunological genes in goldfish. Female parasitic L. cyprinacea worms were blackish and hairy. The in vitro study on L. cyprinacea adults using star anise revealed that the LC50 was 12.5 and 25 μg/mL for 2 and 1 h exposure periods, respectively. Interleukin (IL-1β) and IL-6 were grossly upregulated in C. auratus-infested skin by L. cyprinacea after treatment by 1 week, then declined after 3 weeks. In contrast, TNF-α was 18 folds upregulated in the first week after treatment, with a decline after 3 weeks. In conclusion, star anise is recommended as a safe and economical agent for controlling L. cyprinacea infestation in fish."

Due to their antioxidant activity and phenolic content, anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare L.) were chosen to increase the added value of zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) purees. At the same time, this work aimed to determine the influence of heat treatment on various characteristics of the final product. The phytochemical content, color parameters, and rheological and textural parameters of zucchini purees enriched with herbal aqueous extracts were determined after processing and after one week of storage (4 °C). In the case of antioxidant activity, samples registered a variation between 6.62 ± 1.71 and 38.32 ± 3.85 µM Trolox/g DW for the samples processed by steam convection. The total difference color parameter (ΔE) increased seven times after one week of storage compared to samples at T0. Fennel and anise aqueous extracts helped improve the rheological behavior of zucchini samples both by steam and hot air convection. This study may serve as a springboard for future investigations and clinical trials into the scientific validity and safety of ready-to-eat foods with special destinations.",

The present research work aims to appraise and validate the potential of polyphenol-rich star anise tea (SAT) on oxidative stress, obesity and related biochemical parameters in high-fat-sugar-diet (HFSD)-induced obesity model in rats. SAT was prepared using the traditional method in warm water. The Reverse Phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis was performed for the simultaneous determination of phenolic acids and flavonoids in SAT. Two doses (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) were selected to investigate the anti-obesity potential of SAT using HFSD-induced obese rat model. Major (>5 mg/100 mL) phenolic acids in SAT were p-coumeric acid, gallic aid, cinamic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid while catechin and rutin were the major flavonoids detected in the SAT. SAT exhibited 51.3% DPPH radical scavenging activity. In vivo study showed that higher doses of SAT (500 mg/kg body weight) significantly reduced the body weight increase (74.82%) and BMI (0.64 g/cm2). Moreover, significant reductions in the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and VLDL were recorded in all the treatment groups in comparison to the HFSDC group. Furthermore, SAT reduced the alterations in MDA, SOD and GSH levels of experimental groups thus showing the potential against oxidative stress. The SAT-500 group showed a significant decrease in the elevated kidney and liver weights and atherogenic index in comparison to the HFSDC group. The present study proved that SAT exhibited strong protective effects against obesity and oxidative stress, especially at higher doses."

      "abstract": "Many plants, including anise, have tiny, non-uniform seeds with low and light nutrient reserves. The seeds also show a weak establishment, especially under stressful conditions where their accurate planting in the soil and optimal yield are tough. This study sought to improve anise seeds' physical and physiological characteristics under drought stress. To this end, two factorial experiments under laboratory and greenhouse conditions were performed in a completely randomized design with 4 and 3 replications, respectively. Five levels of seed inoculation (inoculation with T36 and T43 of Trichoderma harzianum, and CHA0 and B52 of Pseudomonas fluorescent, and non-inoculation which means that control seeds were not treated with microbial inoculant), three levels of coating (K10P20, K10P10V5, and non-coating), and three levels of drought stress (0, -3, and -6 bars) were considered as the factorial experiment [vermiculite (V), kaolin (K), and perlite (P) numbers refer to the amount of material used in grams]. The laboratory experiment revealed that the combined treatments of bio-agents with coating increased the physical and germination characteristics of anise seeds compared to the control treatment. The greenhouse experiment showed that drought stress reduced the initial growth indices. Still, the combination treatments of biological agents and coating (fillers) could alleviate the destructive effects of drought stress to some extent and improve these indices. The best treatment was provided by T36 and K10P20 in both experiments, which significantly increased morphological indices."

      "abstract": "Recently, the effects of weed control on crop yield, quality and soil fertility have been increasingly investigated. However, soil microorganism diversity under weed control, especially for aromatic plants, is little studied. Mechanical weeding effects on soil fertility and microbial diversity in star anise plantations remain unknown, limiting improvements in crop quality and yield through weed control. Therefore, mechanical weeding (MW) and no weeding (NW) zones were randomly designed in the same star anise plantation to study the mechanical weeding impacts on soil biological properties and microbial diversity. The phosphatase activity of MW soil was significantly higher than that of NW soil; however, aminopeptidase activity was significantly lower than that under NW. There was no significant difference in β-glucosidase activity between MW and NW. Moreover, soil microbial biomass C and N in MW soil were significantly higher than those of NW, but soil microbial biomass P was significantly lower than that of NW. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, WPS-2, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia were the predominant bacterial phyla in MW and NW soils. Specifically, Bacteroidetes was enriched in MW soil, being the unique dominant bacteria. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, unclassified_k_Fungi, Rozellomycota and Mortierellomycota were the predominant fungi in MW and NW soils. The numbers of dominant bacterial genera (> 1%) were 26 and 23 for NW and MW soils, respectively. Among them, norank_f__norank_o__norank_c__Subgroup_6, 1921-2 and norank_f__norank_o__B12-WMSP1 went undetected in MW soil. Moreover, the numbers of dominant fungi in soils of star anise plantations were 11 and 9 for NW and MW, respectively. Among them, only unclassified_f__Clavicipitaceae and Mortierella went undetected in MW soils. Thus, soil microbial community structures are not significantly altered by mechanical weeding. The above results suggest that soil fertility can be improved and soil heath can be maintained by mechanical weeding in star anise plantations. Moreover, soil-borne diseases maybe easily occurred under NW treatment in star anise plantation.",

Fruits of Pimpinella anisum (anise) are extensively consumed as food additives; however, the sprouting-induced changes in their nutritious metabolites are hardly studied. Herein, we investigated the bioactive metabolites, phytochemicals, and antioxidant properties of fruits, sprouts (9-day-old), and mature tissue (5-week-old) of anise under laser irradiation treatment (He-Ne laser, 632 nm). Laser treatment increased biomass accumulation of both anise sprouts and mature plants. Bioactive primary (e.g., proteins and sugars) and secondary metabolites (e.g., phenolic compounds), as well as mineral levels, were significantly enhanced by sprouting and/or laser light treatment. Meanwhile, laser light has improved the levels of essential oils and their related precursors (e.g., phenylalanine), as well as enzyme activities [e.g., O-methyltransferase and 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS)] in mature tissues. Moreover, laser light induced higher levels of antioxidant and anti-lipidemic activities in sprouts as compared to fruits and mature tissues. Particularly at the sprouting stage, anise was more responsive to laser light treatment than mature plants."

Kuntze) (denoted BLAB tea) is traditionally used to relief allergy reaction including allergic rhinitis. However, little is known about its underlining mechanism of anti-allergic effects. METHODS: To investigate the anti-allergenic mechanism of BLAB tea, we treated ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis (AR) model of mice with BLAB tea, and elucidated its possible mechanism of action. Mice in the control group were treated with phosphate-buffered saline only. Subsequently, the infiltration of different inflammatory cells was measured. In addition, histopathological changes in the nasal mucosa, and the levels of allergen-specific cytokines and OVA-specific immunoglobulins were measured. RESULTS: The aqueous extract of BLAB significantly alleviated the nasal symptoms and reduced the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa and nasal lavage fluid of AR model of mice. CONCLUSION: The aqueous extract of BLAB induced the production of Th1 and Treg cytokines and inhibited the release of Th2 cytokines and histamine in nasal mucosa and serum of mice while decreasing the serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a. These results suggest the potential of the aqueous extract of BLAB as a treatment option for allergic diseases."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Star anise fruits (Illicium verum Hook.) have been used as an important treatment in traditional Chinese medicine. The previous studies reported the activity of the non-polar fractions as potential sources of antibacterial metabolites, and little was done concerning the polar fractions of star anise. METHODS: The antibacterial activity of the star anise aqueous methanolic (50%) extract against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii AB5057 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA USA300) was investigated in vitro (disc diffusion assay, minimum bactericidal concentration determination, anti-biofilm activity and biofilm detachment activity). The antibacterial activity was further tested in vivo using a murine model of MRSA skin infection. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC/HRMS) approach was applied for the identification of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity. The antioxidant potential was evaluated using five in vitro assays: TAC (total antioxidant capacity), DPPH, ABTS, FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and iron-reducing power. RESULTS: In vitro, star anise aqueous methanolic extract showed significant inhibition and detachment activity against biofilm formation by the multidrug-resistant and highly virulent Acinetobacter baumannii AB5057 and MRSA USA300. The topical application of the extract in vivo significantly reduced the bacterial load in MRSA-infected skin lesions. The extract showed strong antioxidant activity using five different complementary methods. More than seventy metabolites from different classes were identified: phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids, sesquiterpenes, tannins, lignans and flavonoids. CONCLUSION: This study proposes the potential use of star anise polar fraction in anti-virulence strategies against persistent infections and for the treatment of staphylococcal skin infections as a topical antimicrobial agent. To our knowledge, our research is the first to provide the complete polar metabolome list of star anise in an approach to understand the relationship between the chemistry of these metabolites and the proposed antibacterial activity."

So, the aim of the present study was to compare the effect Pimpinella Anisum (Anise) with placebo on the intensity of the symptoms of PMS. Methods The present study was a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial. College students who were suffering from PMS and had the inclusion criteria were selected and randomly assigned into two groups of intervention (Anise) and control (placebo). Participants in the intervention group, received 110 mg capsules of Anise three times day (a total dose of 330 mg per day); the control group received similar capsules with the same dosing that contained starch. Consumption of the capsules was started 7 days before the start of the menstruation and continued until 3 days after, which was a total of 10 days during two consecutive menstruation cycles. The intensity of the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome was measured using Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST). To compare the intensity of the symptoms between the two study groups, generalized estimating equation statistical method was used. Results Eventually, sixty-seven 18-35 year old college students who were suffering from premenstrual syndrome were enrolled in the study. Comparing the mean score of the intensity of the syndrome between the two groups after the first and the second menstruation cycles showed a decrease in the intervention group to 13.9 (p-value<0.001; 95% CI: 16.5,-11.4) and 9.8 (p-value<0.001; 95% CI: 12.4,-7.3), respectively. Conclusion Results of the study showed that, in general, Anise was effective in decreasing the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome in comparison to placebo."

There were interactions between SAO supplementation and E. coli challenge for the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in serum and for the activity of GSH-Px in the liver of birds. Supplementation of SAO enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes but decreased the MDA content in the serum and liver of birds, and it also enhanced the expression of genes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the liver of the birds. Meanwhile, supplementation of SAO can also reduce E. coli challenge-induced oxidative stress in the serum and liver of birds, and the efficacy of SAO in birds during subclinical E. coli challenge is dose-dependent. In conclusion, the enhancement of antioxidant capacity by star anise or its effective compounds is through upregulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway. The optimum supplementation dose of SAO for protecting birds against E. coli challenge is 400 mg/kg.",

      "abstract": "Background Depression is a psychiatric disease condition and the chronic mild stress (CMS) model is a well-known and valuable animal model of depression. Geranium oil and anise oil were chosen for such a study. The aim of this research was to establish the geranium oil and anise oil effect to ameliorate CMS-related symptoms. Methods This research included 80 male albino rats each group of 10 rats and the animals were divided into two major groups: normal and CMS. The normal group was subdivided into four (control, geranium oil, anise oil and venlafaxine drug) subgroups treated orally with saline, geranium oil, anise oil and venlafaxine drug, respectively, for 4 weeks. The CMS group was subdivided into four (CMS without any treatment, CMS + geranium oil, CMS + anise oil and CMS + venlafaxine drug) subgroups treated orally with geranium oil, anise oil and venlafaxine drug, respectively, for 4 weeks. Results The sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test, the distance traveled test and center square entries test were decreased, while center square duration test, immobility time in tail suspension test and floating time in forced swimming test were increased in CMS. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase levels decreased but malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels increased in brain cerebral cortex and hippocampus areas in CMS. The oral intake of geranium oil and anise oil pushes all these parameters to approach the control levels. These results were supported by histopathological investigations of both brain cerebral cortex and hippocampus tissues. Conclusions Geranium oil and anise oil ameliorate CMS-related symptoms and this effect were related to the antioxidant effects of oils.",

We describe here an innovative strategy for the identification of a new gastric lipase inhibitor from star anise for the treatment of obesity. After plant screening assays for gastric lipase inhibition, star anise was selected and investigated by bioactivity guided fractionation. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting allowed the detection of an inhibitor covalently bound to the catalytic serine of gastric lipase. A mass-directed screening approach using UPLC-HRMS and accurate mass determination searching identified the flavonoid myricitrin-5-methyl ether (M5ME) as a lipase inhibitor. The inhibitory activity was rationalized based on molecular docking, showing that M5ME is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by gastric lipase. Overall, our data suggest that M5ME may be considered as a potential candidate for future application as a gastric lipase inhibitor for the treatment of obesity.",

Dietary treatments were non-star anise oil supplementation and supplemented with SAO at the level of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg diet. The birds were fed the diets for 56 d. Average egg weight, average daily feed intake (ADFI), egg mass, laying rate, and feed conversion of each replicate were measured. Blood and liver samples from 12 birds were obtained, 72 eggs were picked out, per treatment at day 28 and day 56 of the experiment, and eggs stored for 56 d, to determine antioxidant status in serum, liver, and yolk. All laying hens had similar average egg weight, egg mass, laying rate, and feed conversion in day 29 to day 56 or the entire period of the experiment but significant difference on ADFI in day 1 to day 56. However, increasing diet concentration of SAO tended to improve (P < 0.10) egg mass, average egg weight, and ADFI in day 1 to day 28. Supplementation of SAO linearly increased (P < 0.05) activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) (day 28 and day 56) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) (day 56) in serum, GSH-PX (day 28 and day 56) in liver and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) (day 56) in serum and liver, but linearly reduced (P < 0.05) concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) (day 28 and day 56) in liver. Supplementation of SAO linearly increased (P < 0.05) T-SOD activity at day 14 and day 28, reduced (P < 0.05) MDA concentration at day 42 and day 56 of the experiment in yolk. Increasing content of SAO linearly (P < 0.05) increased T-SOD activity in yolk of eggs stored at day 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56, decreased MDA content of eggs stored at day 42 and 56, whether laying hens fed diets for 28 or 56 d. Dietary supplementation of SAO enhanced laying performance and overall antioxidant status of laying hens in a dose-dependent manner.",

For this purpose, at the first, the physical and mechanical properties of the produced films were studied. Then, the chicken burger was covered with the produced films. Different treatment were analyzed by biochemical properties such as moisture and thiobarbituric acid, bacteriological properties such as total viable counts and total psychrotrophic counts, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The results of this study showed that adding AEO improved the properties of CF, the moisture, solubility, and water vapor permeability decreased in these films. By increasing the concentration of AEO the tensile strength and elasticity of film were increased. CF with AEO, delayed lipid oxidation in chicken burger and improved the chemical properties of chicken burger. Also, microbial spoilage in these samples decreased significantly (p < .05) compared to the control sample. AEO at 2% in all experiments had better results than other treatments (p < .05), and the AEO (1.5% and 2%) had acceptable biochemical, bacteriological attributes up to end of storage, and these treatments could reduce the population of pathogen bacteria below the acceptable level from day 3 until the end of the storage period. Sensory score of the treatment containing AEO at 1.5% was higher than the sensory score of AEO at 2%. Overall, the results of this study showed that the use of CF with AEO as a natural preservative increased the shelf life of meat products. Considering the relatively similar anti-oxidation and antimicrobial effect of AEO at 1.5 and 2% and also economic aspects, optimum dose for AEO could be 1.5% in the film."

Anise oil has been suggested for the treatment of bowel disorders in Persian medical textbooks. Based on TPM scholars, this ingredient has a favorable effect on gastrointestinal diseases. We did this trial to determine the efficacy and safety of enteric coated capsules of anise oil for clinical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: This three-armed double-blind clinical trial was carried out from August 2014 to February 2015. 120 patients were divided into three groups by block randomization: AnisEncap, placebo and Colpermin®. Patients in each group received 3 similar capsules per day for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was measured as a visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and the secondary outcome was assessed with an IBS-quality of life questionnaire. Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables and t-tests to compare continuous variables. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics among the three groups. According to intention-to-treat sample analysis, 75% of patients in the treatment group, 35% in the placebo group and 52.5% in active control group were free from IBS symptoms (P<0.001). The effectiveness of AnisEncap in improving IBS symptoms (abdominal discomfort or pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation severity, difficulty in defecation, gastroesophageal reflux, headache, tiredness, overall satisfaction and quality of life) was significantly greater than placebo or Colpermin® after the 4-week treatment period and the 2-week follow-up period (P<0.0001). The number needed to treat for enteric coated capsules of anise oil was 4, which indicated significantly superior efficacy compared to the other two groups (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of AnisEncap was superior to that of placebo or Colpermin® in patients with IBS. Further studies are suggested to find the main mechanism of action of anise oil in this regard.",

The objective of this study was to establish the protective effect of anise oil in favism disorders. Forty-eight male albino rats were divided into six groups: group 1 orally administrated 1 mL distilled water, group 2 orally received 300 mg/kg anise oil, and group 3 orally administrated 100 mg/kg anethole over a seven-day period, group 4 favism-induced rats, group 5 orally administrated 300 mg/kg anise oil and group 6 orally administrated 100 mg/kg anethole once a day over a seven-day period prior to favism induction. The result obtained revealed that oral administration of either anise oil or anethole into normal rats over a seven-day period did not induce any change. Following favism induction, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red and white blood cell counts, serum glucose, blood glutathione, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, total protein, globulin, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases levels were significantly decreased, while serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin showed significant increase. Pretreatment with either anise oil or anethole into favism-induced rats prevented these changes. Favism also induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and prior treatment of anise oil maintained liver DNA content. These results were supported by histopathological evaluation. In conclusion, anise oil pretreatment into favism-induced rats decreased the favism disorders, and this effect was related to the anethole ingredient of the oil.",

(Austrobaileyales: Schisandraceae)) were extracted with methyl alcohol (MA), ethyl acetate (EA), and petroleum ether (PE) at 25°C. The constituents were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the repellency and contact toxicity of the extracts against Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) adults were tested. Forty-four compounds, whose concentrations were more than 0.2%, were separated and identified from the MA, EA, and PE extracts. The extraction yields of trans-anethole, the most abundant biologically active compound in I. verum, were 9.7%, 7.5%, and 10.1% in the MA, EA, and PE extracts, respectively. Repellency increased with increasing extract dose. The average repellency rate of the extracts against S. zeamais adults peaked at 125.79 µg/cm(2) 72 hr after treatment. The percentage repellency of the EA extract reached 76.9%, making it a class IV repellent. Contact toxicity assays showed average mortalities of 85.4% (MA), 94.5% (EA), and 91.1% (PE). The EA extract had the lowest median lethal dose, at 21.2 µg/cm(2) 72 hr after treatment. The results suggest that I. verum fruit extracts and trans-anethole can potentially be developed as a grain protectant to control stored-product insect pests. Other active constituents in the EA extract merit further research.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In previous years, several publications have reported cases of infants presenting neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of star anise tea. Such teas are sometimes given in various cultures for the treatment of infant colic pains. In most cases, the cause of intoxication was contamination of Chinese star anise (Illicium verum) by Japanese star anise (Illicium anisatum). Indeed, the toxicity of Illicium anisatum, also known as Shikimi, is caused by its content in potent neurotoxins (anisatin, neoanisatin, and pseudoanisatin), due to their activity as non-competitive antagonists of GABA receptors. The main reasons explaining the frequent contaminations are the strong macroscopic resemblance of the 2 substances, as well as the fact that the fruits are often sold partially broken or in ground form. Therefore, in most cases, chemical analysis is required to determine the possible adulterations. CASE REPORT: A 2-month-old infant, in good general health, was brought to the emergency unit after 3 consecutive episodes of central cyanosis and tetany of the limbs with spontaneous recovery the same afternoon. The child was also very irritable, regurgitated a lot, and positioned himself in opisthotonos. Between these episodes, the neurological exam showed some perturbations (horizontal nystagmus and Bell's phenomenon, hypertony of the extensor muscles, and mild hypotony of the axial flexor muscles) with slow improvement over the following hours. The remaining clinical exam, the laboratory work (complete blood count, renal, hepatic, and muscular tests, capillary blood gas, plasmatic amino acids, and urinary organic acids), and the electroencephalogram findings were all normal. In the course of a detailed interview, the parents reported having given 3 bottles to their child, each one containing 200 mL of an infusion with 4 to 5 fruits of star anise, in the hours preceding the symptoms to relieve colic pains. The last seizure-like event took place approximately 8h after the last ingestion. We could prove the ingestion of anisatin, the toxic substance found in Japanese star anise, and the contamination of Chinese star anise by the Japanese species. Indeed, the anisatin analysis by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) in a urine sample taken 22 h after the last infusion ingestion showed trace amounts of the substance. In another urine sample taken 33 h after ingestion, no anisatin could be detected. Furthermore, the analysis of the fruit sample gave an anisatin concentration of 7800 μg/kg while the maximum tolerance value in Switzerland is 1000 μg/kg. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of ALTE in infants should always include the possibility of intoxication. Star anise is generally considered a harmless medicine. Nevertheless, it can sometimes cause a severe intoxication resulting in various neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms. To prevent such events, not only the parents, but also the care personnel and pharmacists must be informed about the possible adverse effects caused either by the overdose of Chinese star anise or by the eventual contamination of herbal teas with Japanese star anise. A better control of the substances by the health authorities is also necessary.",

We designed a randomized, controlled, parallel group trial involving 100 participants with active head louse infestation to investigate the activity of a coconut and anise spray and to see whether permethrin lotion is still effective, using two applications of product 9 days apart. The spray was significantly more successful (41/50, 82.0%) cures compared with permethrin (21/50, 42.0%; p < 0.0001, difference 40.0%, 95% confidence interval of 22.5% to 57.5%). Per-protocol success was 83.3% and 44.7%, respectively. Thirty-three people reported irritant reactions following alcohol contact with excoriated skin. We concluded that, although permethrin lotion is still effective for some people, the coconut and anise spray can be a significantly more effective alternative treatment.",

Clinical HSV-1 isolates containing frameshift mutations in the thymidine kinase (TK) gene, an insertion or a deletion, yield a non-functional thymidine kinase enzyme resulting in phenotypical resistance against aciclovir. The inhibitory activity of three different essential oils against herpes simplex virus isolates was tested in-vitro using a plaque reduction assay. All essential oils exhibited high levels of antiviral activity against aciclovir-sensitive HSV strain KOS and aciclovir-resistant clinical HSV isolates as well as aciclovir-resistant strain Angelotti. At maximum noncytotoxic concentrations of the plant oils, plaque formation was significantly reduced by 96.6-99.9%, when herpesviruses were preincubated with drugs before attachment to host cells. No significant effect on viral infectivity could be achieved by adding these compounds during the replication phase. These results indicate that anise oil, dwarf-pine oil and chamomile oil affected the virus by interrupting adsorption of herpesviruses and in a different manner than aciclovir, which is effective after attachment inside the infected cells. Thus the investigated essential oils are capable of exerting a direct effect on HSV and might be useful in the treatment of drug-resistant viruses. Chamomile oil did not reveal any irritating potential on hen's egg chorioallantoic membrane, demonstrated the highest selectivity index among the oils tested and was highly active against clinically relevant aciclovir-resistant HSV-1 strains.",

      "abstract": "The generation of free radicals is a cause of many pathological conditions like diabetes mellitus, cancer, stroke, etc. Free radicals cause damage to cellular DNA and initiate carcinogenesis. Free radicals also bring about proliferation of cells via cell signaling. An inverse relationship between the consumption of vegetable diets and the risk of cancer has been established. In the present study, Star anise (Illicium verum), which is a commonly used condiment in Indian cuisine, was assessed for its anti-carcinogenic potential in N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) initiated and phenobarbital (PB) promoted hepato-carcinogenesis. Rats were randomly selected for eight experimental groups. The carcinogenesis was induced by injecting the rats, with a single dose of NDEA (200mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally as initiator, followed by promotion with PB (0.05%) in drinking water for 14 consecutive weeks. The treatment with NDEA increased liver weight, while Star anise (Star) treatment reduced the liver weight of rats. The treatment with Star throughout for 20 weeks or during the promotion stage (6-20 weeks) significantly reduced the nodule incidence and nodule multiplicity in the rats, while the treatment with Star at the initiation phase (first 4 weeks) only could not reduce these parameters. The treatment with Star for 20 consecutive weeks significantly reduced the nodule size and nodule volume. The treatment with Star throughout as well as at the promotion stage lowered the lipid peroxidation (LPO) in liver and erythrocytes, while the LPO was not lowered, when Star was administered during initiation stage only. The treatment with Star restored the liver and erythrocyte super-oxide dismutase (SOD) activities to normal in the carcinogenesis-induced rats. The liver catalase (CAT) activity increased in all the treated groups. The erythrocyte CAT activity increased in the rats treated with Star during initiation and promotion stage only. The liver glutathione (GSH) level increased significantly in the groups treated with Star. The erythrocyte GSH level was lowered in the rats treated with NDEA and PB, however, Star treatment helped in increasing the erythrocyte GSH level to some extent. The liver and erythrocyte glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity increased in all the groups treated with NDEA and PB. The treatment with Star decreased GST level significantly. These results indicate that the treatment with Star reduces the tumor burden, lowers oxidative stress and increases the level of phase II enzymes, which may contribute to its anti-carcinogenic potential.",

Heifers were fed a 90:10 concentrate:barley straw diet (16% CP; 25% NDF) for ad libitum intake. Each period consisted of 15 d for adaptation and 6 d for sampling. On d 16 to 18, DM and water intakes were measured. On d 19 to 21 ruminal contents were sampled at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after feeding to determine ruminal pH and the concentrations of VFA, L-lactate, large peptides, small peptides plus AA (SPep+AA), and ammonia N. On d 20 and 21, samples of ruminal fluid were collected at 0 and 3 h after feeding to determine protozoal counts. In Exp. 1, CIE1 and AEX decreased (P < 0.05) total DMI, concentrate DMI, and water intake. The increase (P < 0.05) in SPep+AA and the decrease (P < 0.05) in ammonia N when supplementing CIE1 suggest that deamination was inhibited. Treatment AEX increased (P < 0.05) the acetate to propionate ratio, which is less efficient for beef production. Treatment CIE1 increased (P < 0.05) counts of holotrichs. Effects of AEX and CIE1 were not additive for many of the measured metabolites. In Exp. 2, treatments had no effect on ruminal pH, total VFA concentration, and butyrate proportion. The capsicum oil treatment increased (P < 0.05) DMI, water intake, and SPep+AA N concentration and decreased (P < 0.05) acetate proportion, branched-chain VFA concentration, and large peptide N concentration. The cinnamaldehyde (0.6 g/d) and eugenol (0.3 g/d) treatment decreased (P < 0.05) water intake, acetate proportion, branched-chain VFA, L-lactate, and ammonia N concentrations and increased (P < 0.05) propionate proportion and SPep+AA N concentration. The anise oil treatment decreased (P < 0.05) acetate to propionate ratio, branched-chain VFA and ammonia N concentrations, and protozoal counts. The results indicate that at the doses used a mixture of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, anise oil, and capsicum oil may be useful as modifiers of rumen fermentation in beef production systems.",

Recently, concern has been raised regarding the adulteration of Chinese star anise with Japanese star anise. We report 7 cases of adverse neurologic reactions in infants seen with the home administration of star anise tea. In addition, we have found evidence that Chinese star anise has been contaminated with Japanese star anise.

CASE REPORTS: We report 2 cases of star anise poisoning in infants before 6 months of age. Star anise herbal tea was given by parents. Tremors or spasms, hypertonia, hyperexcitability with crying, nystagmus, and vomiting were observed. Contamination or adulteration of Chinese star anise (Illicium verum Hook), with Japanese star anise (Illicium religiosum) was proved in one child. CONCLUSION: Confusion or blending between Chinese and Japanese star anise may cause poisoning. Japanese star anise is a neurotoxic plant indeed, because it contains sesquiterpenic lactones. From November 2001, star anise products are theoretically prohibited in France, but they may be still available in some small groceries, or imported by families themselves.",

      "abstract": "Despite its potential toxicity, the use of star anise infusions for the treatment of infant colic is firmly rooted in our culture. In the last year, several cases of infants with acute neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of large quantities of star-shaped anise have been reported in Spain. We report a 1-month old girl who was admitted to our emergency room with convulsive status after ingesting a considerable amount of star anis administered to relieve possible infant colic. The patient required three repeat doses of diazepam to control the seizures. Because no abnormalities were found and outcome was favorable without anticonvulsant therapy, the clinical symptoms can be attributed to star anise ingestion, which contains potent neurotoxins such as veranisatins. The etiopathogenesis of this process and star anise toxicity are discussed and the need for the regulation of natural products with pharmacological effects which are freely dispensed from drug stores is stressed. Finally, the regulations of the Ministry of Health and Consumption for 2001 concerning the withdrawal of all anise-containing products are presented.",

Embryogenic cultures were induced following 2,4-D treatment. Root cultures were multiplied on hormone-free medium. The effect of proline on differentiation and phenolic synthesis was also investigated. GC/MS studies indicate that anethole was not produced in root or other differentiated cultures. The predominant phenolic metabolite, however, was an anethole precursor, epoxypseudoisoeugenol-2-methylbutyrate (EPB). Total phenolics and EPB contents were highest in root cultures, which also correlated with higher proline content. Embryo and shoot cultures had reduced phenolic level and EPB and proline contents. Antioxidant activity in all differentiating cultures was high on day 60 compared to that on day 30, and there was no significant difference between differentiating tissues. This indicated that antioxidant protection might be linked not only to phenolics but to other nonphenolic metabolites as well.",

In embryogenic medium without source of carbon or with 20 mmol/l acetate differentiation and growth cease. But like in dedifferentiated cell aggregates the key enzyme activities for glyoxysomes such as isocitrate lyase and malate synthase are induced in globular (3 d old) and heart-shaped (5 d old) embryoids, but not in embryoids at day 7 or later. Similarly, in explants from anise hypocotyl glyoxysomes cannot be derepressed by such treatment. It is concluded that during differentiation of heart-shaped embryoids to torpedo forms the competence of the cells for the yet unknown inducing principle for glyoxysomes is lost."
