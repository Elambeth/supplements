      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthocyanin-containing plant extracts and carotenoids, such as astaxanthin, have been well-known for their antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity, respectively. We hypothesised that a mixture of Ribes nigrum L. (Grossulariaceae) (common name black currant (BC)) and Vaccinium myrtillus L. (Ericaceae) (common name bilberry (BL)) extracts (BC/BL) with standardised anthocyanin content as well as single plant extracts interfered with the replication of Measles virus and Herpesviruses in vitro. METHODS: We treated cell cultures with BC/BL or defined single plant extracts, purified anthocyanins and astaxanthin in different concentrations and subsequently infected the cultures with the Measles virus (wild-type or vaccine strain Edmonston), Herpesvirus 1 or 8, or murine Cytomegalovirus. Then, we analysed the number of infected cells and viral infectivity and compared the data to non-treated controls. RESULTS: The BC/BL extract inhibited wild-type Measles virus replication, syncytia formation and cell-to-cell spread. This suppression was dependent on the wild-type virus-receptor-interaction since the Measles vaccine strain was unaffected by BC/BL treatment. Furthermore, the evidence was provided that the delphinidin-3-rutinoside chloride, a component of BC/BL, and purified astaxanthin, were effective anti-Measles virus compounds. Human Herpesvirus 1 and murine Cytomegalovirus replication was inhibited by BC/BL, single bilberry or black currant extracts, and the BC/BL component delphinidin-3-glucoside chloride. Additionally, we observed that BC/BL seemed to act synergistically with aciclovir. Moreover, BC/BL, the single bilberry and black currant extracts, and the BC/BL components delphinidin-3-glucoside chloride, cyanidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-rutinoside chloride, and petunidin-3-galactoside inhibited human Herpesvirus 8 replication. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that Measles viruses and Herpesviruses are differentially susceptible to a specific BC/BL mixture, single plant extracts, purified anthocyanins and astaxanthin. These compounds might be used in the prevention of viral diseases and in addition to direct-acting antivirals, such as aciclovir.",

The puree was subjected to HPP at 200, 400, and 600 MPa for 5 min (room temperature) or TP at 85 °C for 10 min. The controls were untreated puree (P) and fruit crushed in a mortar (M). All the samples were digested in a static in vitro digestion model, including the mouth, stomach, and small intestine, and subjected to dialysis. The vitamin C, anthocyanin, and antioxidant capacity were monitored at each step of the digestion process. The potential bioaccessibility of the antioxidants studied was calculated in relation to the undigested sample. TP and HPP enabled a high content of vitamin C, anthocyanins, and AC to be maintained. After simulated digestion in the small intestine, a significant decrease was observed in the vitamin C and anthocyanins (approximately 98%) content. However, a high stability (approximately 70%) of both compounds was noted at the gastric stage. HPP and TP significantly affected the potential bioaccessibility of vitamin C and anthocyanins, although the bioaccessibility of both compounds in the samples treated using HPP was higher than when using TP. Moreover, the potential bioaccessibility of vitamin C after HPP treatment (400 and 600 MPa) was higher than the bioaccessibility calculated for the M and P control samples. TP and HPP treatment negatively affected anthocyanin bioaccessibility after dialysis. The most favorable pressure was 400 MPa, as it allowed maintaining the best antioxidant activity after digestion.",

      "abstract": "Currently, the incidence of lifestyle diseases is increasing due to inappropriate nutrition and environmental pollution. To prevent these diseases, various groups of bioactive compounds are needed with a broad spectrum of action and without adverse side effects. Polyphenolic compounds are the most widely studied group of this type of compounds. They occur widely in plants, but their content depends on many factors, including the type of plant, climatic conditions, and the date of harvest. The spectrum of bioactivity of phenolic compounds is determined by their chemical structure, concentration, and interaction with other compounds. Traditional recipes have been studied to search for active plant ingredients. Leaves of shrubs and fruit trees were used in folk medicine as a panacea for many diseases and have been forgotten with time, but their benefits are now being rediscovered. In recent years, much new information about biological activity of phenolic compounds from berry bushes (black currant, raspberry, and aronia) was published. This was reviewed and discussed in this article. The mineral content of their leaves was also summarized because minerals constitute a significant component of plant infusions. It has been shown that high antioxidant and biological activity of leaf extracts results from the presence of active phenolic compounds, which occur in definitely higher amounts than in fruits. Therefore, the leaves of berry bushes seem to be a promising source of substances that can be used as replacements for synthetic agents in the treatment and prevention of lifestyle diseases.",

EPR-juice had 9- and 5-fold higher contents of phenolic compounds compared with the NEB- and EB-juices, respectively. Effect of the low content and stability of phenolics was noticed as loss of the visual color in the NEB-juice during storage. The decrease in monomeric anthocyanins and the increase in phenolic acids were most severe in the NEB-juice, whereas the most significant decline in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives occurred in the enzyme-treated juices. Storage in light induced less change in the phenolic composition in EPR-juice than in the two other juices. The study gave new knowledge on changes in individual metabolites, in sensory properties and in the shelf life of berry juices.",

      "abstract": "Black currant extract (BCE) is rich in polyphenols and can induce apoptosis in various cancer cells, but the molecular mechanism by which BCE induces cancer cell apoptosis has not been reported. The aim of this work was to elucidate the antitumor effect of BCE and the signal transduction pathways involved. MTT test results revealed that the viability of MKN-45 and TE-1 cells treated with BCE gradually decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant effects achieved after 12 h of treatment. MKN-45 and TE-1 cells clearly showed characteristics of apoptosis: shrinkage, cytoplasmic condensation, and formation of cytoplasmic filaments, even partial detachment. In addition, these results showed MKN-45 cells showed a higher level of apoptosis than TE-1 cells when treated with BCE. Western blot assays showed that the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased in both MKN-45 and TE-1 cells, indicating that BCE induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, BCE-induced apoptosis was mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction involving the PI3K/Akt pathway in both MKN-45 and TE-1 cells. However, BCE-induced cell apoptosis was mediated by the Fas receptor pathway in MKN-45 cells but not in TE-1 cells. BCE-induced apoptosis in MKN-45 cells was associated with the MAP-kinase signaling pathway through the activation of p38 and JNK and the inactivation of Erk1/2. However, it was associated with the MAP-kinase signaling pathway only by means of activation of p38 and JNK in TE-1 cells. These results showed that BCE induces apoptosis of MKN-45 and TE-1 cells through MAPK- and PI3K/Akt-mediated mitochondrial pathways. Thus, BCE may be a promising anticancer candidate.",

      "abstract": "Black currant seeds are obtained as a residue during juice production. Black currant seed oil contains high amounts of nutritionally desirable constituents such as γ-linolenic acid (GLA), α-linolenic acid (ALA) and stearidonic acid (SA), as well as certain phenolic acids, which act as natural antioxidants. Fatty acids and phenolic acids of seeds from black currant cultivars after elicitation with methyl jasmonate (MJ) were examined. GLA contents around 25% with respect to total fatty acid content were measured in seeds after pre-harvest treatment of black currants with 0.02mM MJ in 0.05% Tween-20. High GLA samples also exhibited high SA content (higher than 10% with respect to total fatty acid content); however, ALA dropped (from 16% to 10%). High GLA content seeds also showed increased contents of gallic, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids. In particular, seeds from 0.02mM MJ treated Ben Hope black currants exerted contents of gallic, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids of 201.4, 125.9, 201.3 and 112.5μgg(-1)vs 124.3, 58.6, 165.4 and 95.8μgg(-1) measured in seeds from untreated Ben Hope black currants. Comparable results were obtained for Ben Alder and Ben Gairn berries. Chemical elicitation with 0.02 MJ is proposed as an industrial practice in such a way that, after consideration of quality issues, it would be obtained high added value black currant seeds.",

Juices contained both procyanidins (PC) and prodelphinidins (PD), but the PC-% varied significantly, from 28 to 82% of the total PA. In addition, high PD-% was related to high mDP and total PA content. Enzyme-assisted processing increased significantly total PA (5-14-fold), PD-% (12-65%), and mDP (1.8-6.2-fold) in the juices of all cultivars. Enzymatic treatment increased the contents of large PAs more than those of small PAs. The contents of PA and mDP were positively associated with the mouth-drying and puckering astringent characteristics. However, the PA content did not contribute to the bitter taste. Juices from the most bitter cultivars had the lowest contents of proanthocyanidins regardless of the processing method. This finding indicates the existence of other bitter compounds in black currants in addition to PA.",

Both salivary rates and immunological status of saliva are found to be compromised in smokers. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute time-dependent effect of smoking and black currant consumption on the salivary flow rate (SFR) and salivary IgA secretion rate (sIgA SR) in healthy smokers. SFR, sIgA levels in saliva, and sIgA SRs were determined in healthy smokers (n=8) at eight times of assessment within three consecutive interventions: at the baseline; 5, 30, and 60 min after smoking; 5, 30, and 60 min after black currant consumption (100 g), followed by smoking; and 5 min after black currant consumption. Smoking induced a significant delayed effect on SFR measured 60 min after smoking (P=.03), while black currant consumption preceding smoking prevented that effect. Salivary IgA concentrations and sIgA flow rates were not acutely influenced by smoking. Black currant consumption preceding smoking induced a significant decrease in sIgA concentrations 5 min after the intervention compared with the baseline (P=.046), with a further increasing trend, statistically significant, 60 min after the intervention (P=.025). Although smoking cessation is the most important strategy in the prevention of chronic diseases, the obtained results suggest that the influence of black currant consumption on negative effects of tobacco smoke on salivary flow and immunological status of saliva could partly reduce the smoking-associated risk on oral health.",

The results showed that treatment with anthocyanins not only alleviated inflammation, oxidative stress, steatosis, and even fibrosis but also improved depletion of mitochondrial content and damage of mitochondrial biogenesis and electron transfer chain developed concomitantly in the liver of mice fed the MCD diet. Furthermore, anthocyanins treatment promoted activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). These data provide evidence that anthocyanins possess significant protective effects against NASH and mitochondrial defects in response to a MCD diet, with a mechanism maybe through affecting the AMPK/PGC-1α signaling pathways.",

Sixteen college students were randomly assigned to drink either 16 oz of BCN or a placebo (PLA) twice a day for eight consecutive days. A bout of eccentric knee extensions (3 × 10 sets @ 115% of 1RM) was performed on the fourth day. Outcome measures included muscle soreness (subjective scale from 0 to 10) and blood markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase, CK), inflammation (interleukin-6, IL-6), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Although there were no differences in reported soreness between groups, consumption of BCN reduced CK levels at both 48 (PLA = 82.13% vs. BCN = -6.71%, p = .042) and 96 h post exercise (PLA = 74.96% vs. BCN = -12.11%, p = .030). The change in IL-6 was higher in the PLA group (PLA = 8.84% vs. BCN = -6.54%, p = .023) at 24 h post exercise. The change in ORAC levels was higher in the treatment group (BCN = 2.68% vs. PLA = -6.02%, p = .039) at 48 h post exercise. Our results demonstrate that consumption of BCN prior to and after a bout of eccentric exercise attenuates muscle damage and inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Influenza, a respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses, still represents a major threat to humans and several animal species. Besides vaccination, only two classes of drugs are available for antiviral treatment against this pathogen. Thus, there is a strong need for new effective antivirals against influenza viruses. Here, we tested Ladania067, an extract from the leaves of the wild black currant (Ribes nigrum folium) for potential antiviral activity against influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo. In the range of 0-1 mg/ml the extract showed no cytotoxic effect on three cell lines and a CC50 of 0.5 ± 0.3 mg/ml, on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, the extract did not influence the proliferative status of human lymphocytes. In contrast, Ladania067 was highly effective (EC50 value: 49.3 ± 1.1 ng/ml) against the human pandemic influenza virus strain A/Regensburg/D6/09 (H1N1). The extract exhibited an antiviral effect when the virus was pre-incubated prior to infection or when added directly after infection. No antiviral effect was found when infected cells were treated 2, 4, or 8 h after infection, indicating that Ladania067 blocks a very early step in the virus infection cycle. In the mouse infection model we were able to demonstrate that an intranasal application of 500 μg Ladania067 inhibits progeny virus titers in the lung up to 85% after 24 h. We conclude that the extract from the leaves of the wild black currant may be a promising source for the identification of new molecules with antiviral functions against influenza virus."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of black-currant juice on chronic ethanol-induced oxidative stress and its consequences in liver, brain, and serum of rats. Data demonstrated that administration of black-currant juice to rats improved antioxidant abilities in the examined tissues as evidenced by measurement of activities of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GSSG-R), as well as levels of glutathione (GSH) and vitamins C, E, and A. Ethanol intoxication produced a decrease in the activities and levels of the antioxidants just listed, and the decrease was accompanied by a reduction in levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Further results showed enhanced lipid peroxidation as determined by malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and neuroprostanes and elevated protein levels such as carbonyl groups and dityrosine. Ethanol intoxication altered liver metabolism as evidenced by a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated-receptor (PPARα), AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), and nuclear factor kappa B cells (NFκB) and by an increase in tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) expression. Administration of black-currant juice to ethanol-intoxicated rats exerted an antioxidant response by restoring to normal quantities the antioxidant levels and enzyme activities and prevented lipid and protein oxidative effects. The activities of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, biomarkers of liver damage, returned to normal after black-currant treatment of ethanol-administered animals. In addition, the expression of PPARα, AMPK, TNF-α, and NFκB confirmed the protective effect of the juice. Data thus indicate the extensive antioxidant metabolic effects of black-currant juice that may be beneficial for humans.",

Inadequate early Th1 and Treg responses and increased production of Th2 cytokines are associated with atopy. Breast milk contains several immunomodulatory cytokines and other factors that might influence the maturation of the infant's immune system. We assessed the cytokines in breast milk of mother of newborn infants and their associations with black currant seed oil (BCSO) supplementation during pregnancy, mother's atopic status and the development of infant's atopic dermatitis. METHODS: Mothers and infants from an intervention study by black currant seed oil (n = 31) or olive oil as placebo (n = 30) were included in the study. Breast milk samples were collected during the first 3 months of breastfeeding. Breast milk levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF were measured by Luminex technology. RESULTS: BCSO intervention group had decreased level of IL-4 (p = 0.044) and elevated level of IFN-γ (p = 0.014) in breast milk as compared to olive oil group. No significant differences were observed in IL-5, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF levels between the BCSO and olive oil groups. Mothers who had atopic dermatitis had significantly decreased levels of IL-10 (p = 0.044) in breast milk. Breast milk of the mothers of the children who developed atopic dermatitis had lower levels of IFN-γ (p = 0.039) as compared to the breast milk of the mothers of the children without dermatitis. CONCLUSION: Dietary intervention with BCSO had immunomodulatory effects on breast milk cytokine production towards Th2 to Th1 immunodeviation.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the inhibitory effects of 4 different types of black currant anthocyanins (BCAs) on ocular elongation in 2 different chick myopia models. METHODS: In the first model, diffusers were used to induce form vision deprivation. In the second model, negative (-8D) spherical lenses were used to create a defocused retinal image. Either the diffusers or the -8D lenses were placed on the right eyes of 8-day-old chicks for 4 days. Ocular biometric components were measured using an A-scan ultrasound instrument on the third day after application of either the diffusers or -8D lenses. Interocular differences (globe component dimensions of the right diffuser or eyes covered with -8D lenses minus those of the open left eyes) were considered to evaluate the effect of BCAs. The BCAs used were cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R), delphinidin-3-rutinoside (D3R), and delphinidin-3-glucoside (D3G). Each anthocyanin was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.027 μmol/kg once a day for 3 days. RESULTS: Compared to the vehicle treatment, C3G and C3R treatments significantly reduced both differential increases (positive values of interocular differences) of the ocular axial length induced by diffusers or -8D lenses (diffusers; C3G, C3R, and control: 0.32±0.051 mm, P<0.05; 0.25±0.034 mm, P<0.01; and 0.52±0.047 mm, -8D lenses; C3G, C3R, and control: 0.25±0.049 mm, P<0.01; 0.17±0.049 mm, P<0.001; and 0.50±0.056 mm). In contrast, compared to vehicle treatment, D3R treatment significantly decreased the differential increases in the ocular axial length only in chicks with myopia induced by -8D lenses (D3R and control: 0.17±0.049 mm and 0.50±0.056 mm, P<0.001). D3G did not inhibit the differential increase in the ocular axial length induced by either diffusers or -8D lenses. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the 4 tested BCAs had different effects on the 2 different experimental models of myopia.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), considered to be one of the most lethal cancers with almost > 1 million deaths reported annually worldwide, remains a devastating disease with no known effective cure. Hence, chemopreventive strategies come into play, offering an effective and safe mode of treatment, ideal to ward off potential cancer risks and mortality. A major predisposing condition, pertinent to the development and progression of HCC is oxidative stress. We previously reported a striking chemopreventive effect of anthocyanin-rich black currant skin extract (BCSE) against diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. The current study aims to elucidate the underlying antioxidant mechanisms of black currant anthocyanins implicated in the previously observed chemopreventive effects against experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. Dietary BCSE (100 and 500 mg/kg) administered four weeks before and 18 weeks after DENA challenge decreased abnormal lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) in a dose-responsive fashion. Mechanistic studies revealed that BCSE upregulated the gene expression of a number of hepatic antioxidant and carcinogen detoxifying enzymes, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, glutathione S-transferase, and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes, in DENA-initiated animals. Protein and mRNA expressions of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were substantially elevated with BCSE treatment, providing a direct evidence of a coordinated activation of the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant pathway, which led to the upregulation of a variety of housekeeping genes. The results of our study provide substantial evidence that black currant bioactive anthocyanins exert chemopreventive actions against DENA-inflicted hepatocarcinogenesis by attenuating oxidative stress through activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

METHODS: BCACs (50 mg/day, n = 19) or their placebos (n = 19) were orally administered once daily for a 24-month period. Systemic blood pressure, pulse rates, intraocular pressure (IOP), ocular blood circulation by laser-speckle flowgraphy, and Humphrey visual field mean deviation (MD) were measured during the 24-month period. RESULTS: As a main outcome measurement, we evaluated the difference between the groups in MD deterioration in the eye with a better MD from the trial's baseline through 24 months. A statistically significant difference was observed between the treatment groups in mean change from baseline in MD 24 months after therapy (p = 0.039, unpaired t test). Upon administration of BCACs, the ocular blood flows during the 24-month observational period increased in comparison with placebo-treated patients. However, no significant changes were observed in systemic and ocular conditions including IOP during the 24-month period. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that oral administration of BCACs may be a safe and promising supplement for patients with OAG in addition to antiglaucoma medication.",

We have previously reported that anthocyanin-rich black currant skin extract (BCSE) inhibits diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis in rats although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Our present study investigates the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of BCSE during DENA rat liver carcinogenesis. Dietary BCSE (100 or 500 mg/kg) treatment for 22 wk afforded a striking inhibition of DENA-induced hepatic gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive preneoplastic foci in a dose-responsive fashion. There was a significant increase in hepatic expression of heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP90), cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in DENA-exposed rat livers. Dietary BCSE dose-dependently abrogated all these elevated inflammatory markers. The possible cardiotoxicity of BCSE was assessed by monitoring cardiac functions using transthoracic echocardiography. BCSE-mediated anti-inflammatory effects during rat liver carcinogenesis have been achieved without any cardiotoxicity. Our results provide convincing evidence, for the very first time, that suppression of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway could be implicated, at least in part, in the chemopreventive effects of black currant bioactive phytoconstituents against experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. These results coupled with an excellent safety profile of BCSE support the development of black currant phytochemicals for the chemoprevention of inflammation-driven hepatocellular cancer.",

      "abstract": "Anthocyanins are known to possess potent anticarcinogenic properties against several cancers thus demonstrating potential for cancer prevention. Black currant (Ribes nigrum L., Grossulariaceae) fruits have a high anthocyanin content. This \"superfruit\" is known to possess various pharmacological effects including alleviation of chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. In contrast to a large volume of literature on the health benefits of black currant, limited evidence on antitumor effects of black currant exists with virtually no data on the prevention of experimental carcinogenesis. In the current study, we have investigated the chemopreventive effects of an anthocyanin-rich black currant skin extract (BCSE) utilizing our well-characterized model of rat liver carcinogenesis. Initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis was done by intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) followed by promotion with phenobarbital. The rats were exposed to dietary BCSE for 4 weeks prior to initiation, and the treatment was continued for 22 consecutive weeks. BCSE dose-dependently decreased the incidence, total number, multiplicity, size and volume of preneoplastic hepatic nodules. The antihepatocarcinogenic effect of BCSE was confirmed by histopathological examination of liver sections. Immunohistochemical analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DNA fragmentation revealed BCSE-mediated inhibition of abnormal cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in DENA-induced rat liver tumorigenesis respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that BCSE-mediated proapototic signal during experimental hepatocarcinogenesis may be propagated via the up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression at the translational level. These results along with a safety profile of BCSE encourage the development of black currant bioactive constituents as chemopreventive agents for human liver cancer.",

      "abstract": "Dietary antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, are helpful in the prevention and control of various diseases by counteracting the imbalance of oxidative and antioxidative factors in the living systems. Black currant (Ribes nigrum L., Grossulariaceae) is known to contain high amounts of anthocyanins (250 mg/100 g fresh fruit). Black currant fruits have been used in Asian and European traditional medicine for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Black currant extract has recently been found to be the second most effective amongst nine different berry extracts studied for their free radical scavenging activity. Constituents present in black currant juice have been found to exert a number of health-promoting effects, including immunomodulatory, antimicrobial and antiinflammatory actions, inhibition of low-density lipoprotein, and reduction of cardiovascular diseases. Although antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects of black currant juice could be of value in preventing and treating oxidative stress- and inflammation-driven cancers, no experimental evidence is available to now. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential antiproliferative effects of black currant fruit skin extract against HepG2 human liver cancer cells. The aqueous extract yielded an anthocyanin-rich fraction with cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside as one of the major anthocyanins. This fraction exhibited a potent cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells and this effect was more pronounced than that of delphinidin and cyanidin, two major aglycones of anthocyanins present in black currant. Our results indicate, for the first time, that black currant skin containing an anthocyanin-rich fraction inhibits the proliferation of liver cancer cells, possibly due to additive as well as synergistic effects. This product could be useful in the prevention and treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma.",

The dietary influence of tocopherol and fibre-rich black currant seed press residue on serum and stool tocopherol concentration was investigated in a controlled human intervention study. METHODS: Thirty-six women consumed bread enriched with black currant press residue (4 weeks). The resultant faecal and serum tocopherol concentrations were compared with those after a period consuming control bread without press residue and a normal baseline diet. Fibre intake and excretion, antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and vitamin C concentrations in serum and urine were also determined. Samples were obtained with a 5-day standardised diet at the end of each period. RESULTS: The press residue bread lead to significantly increased beta-, gamma-, delta- and total tocopherol intake, serum alpha-, beta-, gamma- and total tocopherol concentration (with and without lipid adjustment), fibre intake and urinary vitamin C concentration compared to control bread (P<0.05). Faecal excretion of total tocopherols and fibre increased compared to baseline (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Fibre intake and excretion influence total tocopherol concentration in lipid-adjusted serum and in stool. The outstandingly high increase of serum gamma-tocopherol concentration through seed press residue consumption could be due to a presumed interruption of the enzymatic tocopherol degradation mechanism by bread constituents.",

The enzyme used, which was from Trichoderma spp., was an effective \"cellulase-hemicellulase\" blend with low β-glucosidase activity and various side activities. Enzyme treatment significantly increased plant cell wall polysaccharide degradation as well as increasing the availability of phenols for subsequent methanolic extraction. The release of anthocyanins and other phenols was dependent on reaction parameters, including enzyme dosage, temperature, and time. At 50 °C, anthocyanin yields following extraction increased by 44% after 3 h and by 60% after 1.5 h for the lower and higher enzyme/substrate ratio (E/S), respectively. Phenolic acids were more easily released in the hydrolytic mixture (supernatant) and, although a short hydrolysis time was adequate to release hydroxybenzoic acids (HBA), hydroxycinnamic acids (HCA) required longer times. The highest E/S value of 0.16 gave a significant increase of flavonol yields in all samples. The antioxidant capacity of extracts, assessed by scavenging of 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity, and the ferric reducing antioxidant potential depended on the concentration and composition of the phenols present.",

This study examined the clarification and haze-diminishing effects of alternative clarification strategies on black currant juice including centrifugation and addition of acidic protease and pectinolytic enzyme preparations and gallic acid. Centrifugation of freshly pressed juice (10,000 g for 15 min) resulted in a approximately 95% reduction of immediate turbidity and had a decreasing effect on haze development in the juice during cold storage without significantly compromising the total phenols levels. The extent of clarification and haze diminishment varied after individual treatments with five different acidic proteases, but one of the protease preparations, Enzeco, derived from Aspergillus niger, consistently tended to perform best. The individual and interactive effects on juice turbidity, total phenols, and total anthocyanin contents of clarification treatments involving the use of two selected acid proteases (Enzeco and Novozyme 89L), a pectinase (Pectinex BE 3-L), and gallic acid were evaluated in a full factorial 2(4) experimental design. Haze development during cold storage decreased when gallic acid or any of the enzyme preparations were employed individually, but negative interaction effects resulted when the pectinase was employed in combination with any of the proteases. After 28 storage days at 2 degrees C, the lowest levels of haze formation were achieved when the Enzeco protease preparation, added at 0.025 g/L, was added with 0.050 g/L of gallic acid and allowed to react in the juice for 90 min at 50 degrees C. The corresponding anthocyanin reduction was approximately 12% (compared to approximately 30% with gelatin silica sol treatment). The data support the hypothesis that phenol-protein interactions are involved in juice turbidity development during cold storage of berry juices and demonstrate that precentrifugation and protease-assisted clarification show promise as an alternative, phenolics-retaining clarification strategy in black currant juice processing.",

Similar heat-induced decreases in the concentration of the terpenes were observed in the two systems. The concentration of a range of terpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated terpenes increased, alpha-terpineol being a main conversion product of most of the examined compounds. In the main, the measured loss of compounds exceeded the detected concentrations of products formed. In addition, determination of glycosidically bound terpenes in the juice was carried out by two methods of enzymatic hydrolysis, namely, addition of beta-glucosidase to an Amberlite XAD-2 isolate or directly to black currant juice. The two methods gave the same patterns of seven released volatile aglyconic terpenes. However, none of the released terpenes are important for the odor of black currant juice.",

The aims of this study were to assess the efficacy of CLA, black currant seed oil (BSO) or a combination of both, compared to placebo, in dogs with AD and to evaluate any changes in fatty acid metabolism with these treatments. Twenty-four dogs with AD were randomly allocated to four groups, and were treated orally each day for two months with either 1 mL/10 kg CLA (80% purity), 1 mL/10 kg pure BSO, 1 mL/10 kg CLA+1 mL/10 kg BSO, or 1 mL/10 kg sugar syrup (placebo). Serum was obtained on days 0, 30 and 60 for analysis of CLA metabolites, linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA). At the same time point, the owners were asked to assess pruritus and the veterinarians evaluated any skin lesions present. Although the best clinical results occurred with BSO treatment alone, improvement of clinical signs and pruritus was not significant with any of the treatments. Serum levels of GLA and DGLA significantly increased in BSO-treated dogs, but not in the CLA+BSO group. CLA at the dosage used in this study was not efficacious in treating canine AD, whereas BSO may help some dogs with AD, although further studies are necessary before this can be recommended as a treatment.",

CAPS was found to consist of rhamnose, mannose, arabinose, galactose, xylose, and glucose in a molar ratio of 11.3:0.9:54.1:29.8:2.0:1.9. CAPS turned out to be partitioned into a soluble component (CAPS-l.m.) and a precipitable component (CAPS-h.m.) with mean MWs of 80,000 and 600,000 respectively in 45% (v/v) ethanol solution. At least in vitro, CAPS-l.m. rather than CAPS-h.m. appeared to play an important role in macrophage activation. Oral administration of black currant juice and CAPS to Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice retarded the growth of the solid tumor by 45% and 51% respectively. CAPS administration had a stimulatory effect on the release of IL-2, IL-10, interferon-gamma, and IL-4 from splenocytes in comparison with PBS treatment in tumor-bearing mice. The IL-4 level was, however, still lower than that exhibited by a group of normal mice. CAPS showed a certain cytotoxicity directly against tumor cells.",

Forty-nine aroma compounds were quantified, and the thermal treatment resulted in concentration increases of most terpenes, aldehydes, furans, and phenols, whereas the concentration of esters slightly decreased. Higher temperatures and longer exposure times had larger effects on the aroma compounds. Odor triangle tests showed no sensory difference between pasteurized juice and juice heated at 60 degrees C, whereas juice heated at 90 degrees C differed significantly from pasteurized juice.

      "abstract": "Several crude and purified polysaccharides from black currant seeds (Ribes nigrum L.) have been isolated, analysed and examined on their effects against Helicobacter pylori in in situ adhesion studies on sections of human gastric mucosa. After pre-treatment of Helicobacter pylori with 0.01 to 0.1 % solutions of the isolated raw polysaccharide (RPS), the epithelial binding of the bacteria was considerably reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, as compared with a non-treated control suspension. Preincubation of the mucosal sections with 0.1 % solutions did not result in a reduced binding of non-treated bacteria. An anion-exchange fraction of RPS eluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer exhibited a comparable, concentration-dependent reduction of adhesion, whereas the water-eluted fraction was ineffective at the respective concentrations. Both subfractions consisted of similar 1,3-linked galactans, decorated with side chains possessing 1,4-galacturonic acid, galactose and arabinose residues. Molecular weight profiling by GPC revealed that the antiadhesive activity of the buffer eluate correlated with high molecular weight components ranging from about 1000 Da to 340 kDa, whereas the ones of the inactive water eluate had molecular weights of about 100 and 25 kDa, respectively. None of the active fractions revealed inhibitory effects on bacterial growth in vitro. We conclude that acidic, high molecular weight galactans are responsible for the antiadhesive qualities of black currant seed extracts and that these polymers are able to block Helicobacter surface receptors, thus inhibiting their interaction with specific binding factors located on human gastric epithelia.",

In this process, selective hydrolysis of the glucosides (D3G and C3G) and rhamnosides (D3R and C3R) was achieved by treatment with beta-glucosidase and hesperidinase (alpha-rhamnosidase), respectively, to improve resolution of anthocyanin components. Especially, selective conversion of the rutinosides into glucosides made the amounts of D3G and C3G increase about 4- and 7-fold, respectively. D3R, C3R, D3G, and C3G were isolated from enzymatic hydrolysates of black currant anthocyanins through Amberlite XAD-7HP absorption followed by preparative HPLC separation, and their crystals were obtained as the flavylium chloride.",

Pharmacological activity was compared with indomethacin and niflumic acid using acute and chronic (21 or 28 days) oral treatment. Black currant extract and lyophilisate revealed significant anti-inflammatory activity comparable to that seen with the reference substances, but without their ulcerogenic potential, even at high doses during chronic treatment.",

Blood filtrability of animals given a fat diet alone was significantly lowered (20.8%; p less than 0.01) as compared with that of animals receiving a standard diet. Blood filtrability of animals receiving a fat diet plus blackcurrant anthocyanosides was not significantly different from that of animals given a standard diet. Emphasis is laid on a new approach to the action of this type of product on blood vessel contents as compared with the known action on the container.",
