      "abstract": "This research was conducted in a greenhouse to examine the effects of solid biochar (25 g kg-1 soil), and biochar-based nanoparticles of magnesium (BNP-MgO), iron (BNP-Fe3O4), and magnesium + iron (BNP-MgO + BNP-Fe3O4) in comparison with control (soil) on German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) under salinity levels (0.9, 6, and 12 dS m-1 as non-saline treatment and moderate and high salinities, respectively). Salinity increased sodium uptake, generation of reactive oxygen species and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities, leading to a reduction in leaf nutrients and pigments, and organs masses. High salinity significantly decreased the essential oil percentage and yield. However, solid and especially enriched biochars with BNP-MgO, BNP-Fe3O4, and their combined form reduced hydrogen peroxide and consequently enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities under saline conditions. The BNP-MgO was the best treatment for enhancing leaf pigments, and the BNP-Fe3O4 was generally the best choice for improving organs masses and essential oil percentage and yield of chamomile under salinity. Therefore, solid and especially enriched biochars, due to their excellent physicochemical properties, were suggested as the suitable soil amendments to mitigate salt toxicity and improve the growth and essential oil production of medicinal plants in the greenhouse and field cultivations."

      "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality among patients with cardiovascular disease and is often associated with myocardial apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). While hydrogen has demonstrated potential in reducing oxidative stress and ERS, recent evidence suggests that magnesium may aid in hydrogen release within the body, further enhancing these protective effects. This study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of magnesium in reducing apoptosis and ERS through hydrogen release in a rat model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced HF. Magnesium was administered orally to ISO-induced HF rats, which improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy, and lowered the plasma levels of creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin-I, and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide precursor in ISO-induced HF rats. It also inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis by upregulating B-cell lymphoma-2, downregulating Bcl-2-associated X protein, and suppressing ERS markers (glucose-related protein 78, activating transcription factor 4, and C/EBP-homologous protein). Magnesium also elevated hydrogen levels in blood, plasma, and cardiac tissue, as well as in artificial gastric juice and pure water, where hydrogen release lasted for at least four hours. Additionally, complementary in vitro experiments were conducted using H9C2 cardiomyocyte injury models, with hydrogen-rich culture medium as the intervention. Hydrogen-rich culture medium improved the survival and proliferation of ISO-treated H9C2 cells, reduced the cell surface area, inhibited apoptosis, and downregulated ERS pathway proteins. However, the protective effects of hydrogen were negated by tunicamycin (an inducer of ERS) in H9C2 cells. In conclusion, magnesium exerts significant cardioprotection by mitigating ERS and apoptosis through hydrogen release effects in ISO-induced HF.",

      "abstract": "Biodegradable porous magnesium alloy (pMg) scaffolds hold significant potential for repair of bone defects owing to favorable mechanical properties and biocompatibility. However, a critical challenge remains in matching the degradation rate of pMg scaffolds with the pace of bone regeneration. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance bone repair. In this study, femoral bone defects in Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with pMg scaffolds, and LIPUS was applied to the defect sites post-operatively. This study primarily investigated the degradation behavior of pMg scaffolds in vivo experiments, as well as their reparative effects on bone defects under LIPUS intervention. In vivo analysis revealed that LIPUS intervention accelerated the degradation of pMg scaffolds by loosening the degradation layer, making it more susceptible to erosion. Concurrently, LIPUS enhanced the accumulation of beneficial calcium and phosphorus compounds on the surface of the pMg scaffolds. Furthermore, the pMg + LIPUS group exhibited enhanced bone formation and mineralization around the degradation site compared to the pMg group alone, attributed to the increasing osteocalcin (OCN) and type I collagen (COL-I) as well as reduction in osteolysis by pMg and LIPUS-induced osteogenesis effect. At the 24-week post-surgery, the hardness value (HV) of regeneration bone in the pMg + LIPUS group had a 15% increase compared to the pMg group and approached the HV of healthy bone. In conclusion, the promotion of bone tissue growth rate under the intervention of LIPUS in conjunction with the degradation rate of pMg scaffolds offers a novel clinical strategy for the repair of bone defects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines have recommended antenatal magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for mothers in preterm labour (<30 weeks' gestation) to reduce the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in the preterm baby. However, the implementation of this guideline in clinical practice was slow, and MgSO4 use varied between maternity units. In 2018, the PRrevention of Cerebral palsy in PreTerm labour (PReCePT) programme, an evidence-based quality improvement (QI) intervention to improve use of MgSO4, was rolled out across England. Earlier evaluation found this programme to be effective and cost-effective over the first 12 months. We extended the original evaluation to determine the programme's longer-term impact over 4 years, its impact in later preterm births, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare MgSO4 use in England (where PReCePT was implemented) to Scotland and Wales (where it was not). METHODS: Quasi-experimental longitudinal study using data from the National Neonatal Research Database on babies born <30 weeks' gestation and admitted to a National Health Service neonatal unit. Primary outcome was the percentage of eligible mothers receiving MgSO4, aggregated to the national level. Impact of PReCePT on MgSO4 use was estimated using multivariable linear regression. The net monetary benefit (NMB) of the programme was estimated. RESULTS: MgSO4 administration rose from 65.8% in 2017 to 85.5% in 2022 in England. PReCePT was associated with a 5.8 percentage points improvement in uptake (95% CI 2.69 to 8.86, p<0.001). Improvement was greater when including older preterm births (<34 weeks' gestation, 8.67 percentage points, 95% CI 6.38 to 10.96, p<0.001). Most gains occurred in the first 2 years following implementation. PReCePT had a NMB of £597 000 with 89% probability of being cost-effective. Following implementation, English uptake appeared to accelerate compared with Scotland and Wales. There was some decline in use coinciding with the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The PReCePT QI programme cost-effectively improved use of antenatal MgSO4, with anticipated benefits to the babies who have been protected from CP."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Cisplatin-associated acute kidney injury (CP-AKI) is a frequent complication of cisplatin chemotherapy and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic administration of intravenous (IV) magnesium attenuates CP-AKI in animal models; however, its association with CP-AKI in humans has not been rigorously evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of prophylactic IV magnesium administration with CP-AKI in patients with cancer undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter study was conducted at 5 major cancer centers across the US and included adult patients with cancer who were treated with a first dose of IV cisplatin between 2006 to 2022. Data analyses were performed from February to December 2024. EXPOSURE: IV magnesium vs no IV magnesium receipt on the first day of cisplatin treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Composite outcome of CP-AKI or death, with CP-AKI defined as a 2-fold or greater increase in serum creatinine levels from baseline or receipt of kidney replacement therapy within 14 days after first dose of IV cisplatin. Secondary outcomes were CP-AKI or death, defined using alternative definitions, as well as major adverse kidney events at 90 days. Inverse probability treatment weighting was used to estimate the association between IV magnesium receipt and CP-AKI. Models were adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, receipt of concurrent nephrotoxic anticancer therapies, site, year of cisplatin administration, and cisplatin dose. RESULTS: A total of 13 719 patients were included (median [IQR] age, 59 [49-67] years; 7817 male [57%]), of whom 3893 (28.4%) received IV magnesium on the first day of cisplatin chemotherapy. The median (IQR) dose of IV magnesium was 2 (1-2) g. CP-AKI or death occurred in 104 of 3893 patients (2.7%) who received IV magnesium, and in 520 of 9826 (5.3%) who did not (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.97). Results were similar across a number of sensitivity analyses and secondary outcomes, including major adverse kidney events at 90 days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This multicenter cohort study found that patients with cancer who received prophylactic IV magnesium before initiating treatment with IV cisplatin had a lower risk of CP-AKI compared to those who did not receive magnesium. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "Dental implants have gained global popularity as a treatment option for tooth loss. The success of dental implants depends on their optimal integration into the tissues of the alveolar bone and the periodontium. However, several factors can hinder the proper osseointegration of implants, with the growth of biofilm on the implant surface and subsequent peri-implant infections being significant concerns. To overcome this challenge, researchers have explored the incorporation of antimicrobial agents onto metallic implant surfaces to mitigate biofilm growth. Ideally these agents should promote osteogenesis while exhibiting antibacterial effects. Magnesium (Mg) has emerged as a promising dual-function implant coating due to its osteogenic and antibacterial properties. Despite several studies, the precise mechanisms behind osteoinductive and antimicrobial effect of Mg is unclear, as yet. This review aims to collate and discuss the utility of Mg as a dental implant coating, its impact on the osteogenic process, potential in mitigating microbial growth, and prospects for the future. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several databases and the findings reveal the promise of Mg as a dual-function dental implant coating material, both as a standalone agent and in combination with other materials. The antibacterial effect of Mg is likely to be due to its (1) toxicity particularly at high concentrations, (2) the production or reactive oxygen species, and (3) pH modulation, while the osteoinductive effect is due to a complex series of cellular and biochemical pathways. Despite its potential both as a standalone and composite coating, challenges such as degradation rate, leaching, and long-term stability must be addressed. Further research is needed to understand the utility of Mg as an implant coating material, particularly in relation to its antibacterial activity, osseointegration, and longevity in the oral milieu."

Logistic regression analysis of 502 gout patients revealed a significant positive association between MDS grade and KDS (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.78-2.58), with the risk remaining elevated in the MDS4 group after adjusting for confounders (OR = 6.25, 95% CI: 2.38-16.44).Causal mediation analysis indicated that MDS fully explained the effect of serum uric acid (SUA) on KDS, suggesting that disrupted magnesium metabolism plays a key role in gout-related kidney injury. Subgroup analysis revealed an increased risk of KDS in obese, hypertensive, and diabetic patients with MDS. MDS should be incorporated into clinical risk assessments for gout, and magnesium supplementation or combined uric acid-lowering therapy should be recommended for high-risk groups to prevent KDS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the primary cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), which can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD) with renal fibrosis. Magnesium lithospermate B (Mlb), a bioactive compound produced from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, exerts nephroprotective effects against AKI. However, the significance of Mlb in the evolution of IRI-induced AKI in patients with CKD remains unclear. Notably, the specific mechanisms underlying the putative antifibrotic activities of Mlb during this progression remain to be fully elucidated. PURPOSE: This study sought to explore the therapeutic benefits of Mlb in AKI-to-CKD progression and uncover the potential mechanisms, with a special interest in its effects on renal fibrosis and cell cycle regulation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Unilateral ischemia/reperfusion (UIR)-induced mouse AKI-to-CKD progression (in vivo) and HK-2 cells with TGF-β-induced fibrosis model (in vitro) were used in the study. The beneficial effects of Mlb on renal fibrosis and cell cycle-related signaling pathways were investigated using histological analysis, molecular assays, network pharmacology, and RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Mlb treatment significantly reduced renal dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, and the G2/M phase cell cycle stalling in mice 14 days post-UIR-induced AKI, subsequently improving renal fibrosis. Mechanistically, Mlb promotes the activity of the CDK1/Cyclin B1 signaling pathway, thereby alleviating the G2/M phase cell cycle stalling. Network pharmacology and RNA sequencing analyses identified the KLF5/CDK1/Cyclin B1 signaling pathway as a potential target of the antifibrotic effects of Mlb, which was further verified in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The KLF5 inhibitor ML264 attenuated the protective effects of Mlb by reducing CDK1/Cyclin B1 expression and reinstating the G2/M phase cell cycle stalling, highlighting the critical role of this pathway in Mlb-mediated renal protection. CONCLUSIONS: Mlb decreases renal fibrosis by inhibiting the G2/M phase cell cycle stalling via the KLF5/CDK1/Cyclin B1 signaling pathway during AKI-to-CKD progression. Our findings offer new insight into the therapeutic potential of Mlb in preventing CKD progression following AKI and identify a previously unrecognized mechanism involving the KLF5/CDK1/Cyclin B1 pathway."

      "abstract": "Postoperative recurrence of glioblastoma (GBM) is a key contributing factor to the unfavorable prognosis of patients. Chemotherapy has been extensively employed as a postoperative treatment for GBM; however, the produced drug resistance significantly undermines the chemotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a multifunctional system based on magnesium micromotor (Mg-Motor-DOX) is designed and fabricated that can generate hydrogen gas in situ and actively deliver the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX). Utilizing a temperature-sensitive hydrogel, Mg-Motor-DOX is administrated in situ to the residual cavity of the tumor after subtotal GBM resection. The produced H2 by the Mg-water reaction not only propels the motion of motors but also functions as an antioxidant to effectively alleviate the neuroinflammation caused by GBM resection. The H2 bubbles create a pronounced vortex flow in situ, greatly enhancing the DOX penetration and the sensitivity of GBM cells to DOX. Therefore, synergistic hydrogen-chemotherapy significantly inhibits the recurrence of the in situ GBM model. RNA-Seq technology further elucidates the role of the strategy in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment via converting cold tumors into hot tumors, thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for the clinical implementation of synergistic hydrogen-chemotherapy."

The membrane's efficiency in removing Bemacid Turquoise dye was optimized through a synergistic combination of artificial neural networks,response surface methodology, and SOLVER. The mixed matrix membrane was comprehensively characterized using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, mechanical properties, point of zero charges, and water contact angle measurements. The optimum conditions were achieved with a membrane composition of 0.6 %, a temperature of 40 °C, and an initial dye concentration of 100 mg. L-1. The findings indicated that the ANN model outperformed the RSM model, demonstrated by its lower values for mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean Squared error (RMSE), along with a higher R2 value. Based on SOLVER, the highest filtration of Bemacid Turquoise was achieved under an initial concentration of 94.08 g. L-1, membrane composition of 0.51 %, and temperature of 50.12 °C.

Oral Mg2+ supplementation is often ineffective due to poor absorption and side effects. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to increase serum Mg2+ in chronic kidney disease, but their effects in KTRs, particularly patients without diabetes, remain unclear. This observational study assessed 63 KTRs treated with dapagliflozin, analyzing the serum Mg2+ levels at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. The hypomagnesemia prevalence, associations with oral supplementation, diabetes status, and diuretic use were evaluated. The results showed a significant Mg2+ increase with SGLT2i therapy, reducing hypomagnesemia regardless of the diabetes status. Oral supplementation did not correlate with improved Mg2+ levels, reinforcing its limited efficacy. Additional benefits included reductions in the body weight, blood pressure, and serum urate without compromising graft function. SGLT2i may offer a novel approach to managing hypomagnesemia in KTRs, potentially reducing the reliance on ineffective supplements while providing renal and cardiovascular benefits. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sweet cherry is highly valued around the world for its sensory qualities. Bioactive properties play significant roles in sweet cherry quality and consumer acceptance due to its health benefits. Plant nutrition through balanced fertilizer application helps in abiotic stresses mitigation, enhancing the biosynthesis of bioactive substances. For three consecutive years, magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) were applied as foliar sprays to sweet cherry trees of the Burlat cultivar, with the aim to improve phytochemical composition. Fruits from each treatment were harvested at the commercial ripening stage to evaluate cherry bioactive composition and antioxidant activity. RESULTS: Overall, the phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity increased over the three trial years, reaching their highest values in 2021, highlighting the effects of continuous fertilization with Mg and K. The Mg treatments (especially Mg250 in 2019 and Mg125 in 2020) enhanced the phytochemical composition of sweet cherries by increasing total phenolics, flavonoids, ortho-diphenols, and anthocyanin contents, as well as boosting antioxidant activity. In contrast, K treatments (mainly K50) led to a decrease in all bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity. The levels of individual phenolic compounds varied across treatments; however, catechin, epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside contents declined over the 3 years, while neochlorogenic acid and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside levels increased, stabilizing in 2020 and 2021. CONCLUSIONS: These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing sweet cherry bioactive properties. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "The development and production of anti-corrosive coatings are critical for medical implants, particularly those that utilize composite coatings made from both flexible organic materials and rigid inorganic materials, which exhibit advantageous mechanical properties and resistance to corrosion. In this work, an organic composite/hydroxyapatite (HA) coating on magnesium alloys is fabricated through a two-step process, which involves the application of a spray technique for the organic silica composite [polyethyleneimine (PEI)/silica sol (Si)], followed by a hydrothermal treatment to deposit hydroxyapatite. The dense and tight layer-by-layer assembly of the PEI/Si/HA coating on the Mg substrate exhibited a corrosion current density of 10-5.6 A/cm2, significantly lower than that of HA and the Mg substrate. After immersion for 13 days, the PEI/Si/HA coatings demonstrated a minimal amount of H2 generation and negligible fluctuations in pH within the solution. Meanwhile, the hydrothermal PEI/Si/HA coatings exhibited significantly weaker corrosion resistance than the PEI/Si/HA coatings synthesized using the spray method. Both electrochemical dynamic data and structural characteristics demonstrate the enhanced corrosion resistance of organic composite/hydroxyapatite coatings, in which polymer chains provided more volume as a buffer for H2 molecules. This organic composite/hydroxyapatite coating on magnesium alloys exhibited huge potential applications in orthopedics."

      "abstract": "The treatment of diabetic wounds (DWs) poses a significant medical challenge. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have demonstrated potential in accelerating healing by delivering growth factors and microRNAs. However, the rapid clearance by the circulatory system limits their concentration and bioavailability within cells. This study employed magnesium-doped bioactive glass (MgBG) to autonomously program sEVs into a vesicle cluster (EPPM), which was subsequently incorporated into a hydrogel to create a comprehensive repair system that enhanced the delivery of both sEVs and MgBG, thereby promoting rapid healing of diabetic wounds. This hydrogel exhibited excellent injectable, self-healing and bioadhesive properties, making it an ideal physical barrier for DWs. In addition, the hydrogels also possessed photoresponsive properties that facilitated their bactericidal activity. The released EPPM significantly increased the intracellular uptake and accumulation of sEVs, with approximately 8.2-fold enhancement in macrophages and 16.7-fold in endothelial cells. The EPPM clusters efficiently induce macrophage M2 polarization, reduce inflammatory responses at the wound site, and recruit cells, thereby promoting angiogenesis and collagen deposition. This integrated repair system provided a new platform for the comprehensive treatment of diabetic wounds."

      "abstract": "Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a key pathological mechanism contributing to memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown that elevating magnesium levels promotes neurogenesis by enhancing the neuronal differentiation of adult neural progenitor cells in vitro. Therefore, this in vivo study aims to determine if magnesium-L-threonate (MgT) can ameliorate cognitive deficit of AD mice by attenuating adult hippocampal neurogenesis impairment and to reveal the underlying mechanisms. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were treated with different doses of MgT and ERK inhibitor PD0325901. The memory ability of each mouse was recorded by Morris Water Maze test. After cognitive test, hippocampus tissues were collected to measure the proportion of BrdU/doublecortin double-labeled cells using the flow cytometry test and assess the expression of doublecortin using PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, the activations of CREB, ERK, P38 and JNK were measured by Western blot to identify the involved mechanisms. The cognitive test confirmed that MgT treatment attenuated the memory impairment of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Flow cytometry test showed that Brdu/doublecortin labeled newborn neurons gradually increased following MgT administration. In line with the flow cytometry results, Western blot and PCR confirmed that MgT administration significantly increased doublecortin expression levels. Furthermore, the ratios of p-ERK/ERK and p-CREB/CREB increased with MgT elevation. In addition, these effects of MgT treatment were markedly reversed by PD0325901 supplementation. In conclusion, MgT treatment improved cognitive decline by ameliorating adult hippocampal neurogenesis impairment in this AD model, possibly via ERK/CREB activation."

      "abstract": "The pathophysiological responses to immune stress (IS) include activation of several processes which are dependent on cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. Magnesium frequently acts as a natural Ca2+ antagonist. In this study we have observed that Mg2 + can protect guinea-pigs against IS. Antigen-sensitized guinea-pigs, which had been fed a magnesiumdeficient diet, were given a single dose (15 mg) of MgCl2 intraperitoneally 1 h before antigen challenge. The development of anaphylactic shock (AS) was observed during the next 2 h, and the hearts were subsequently examined histologically for signs of cardiac myolysis (CM). Magnesium (i) reduced the incidence of CM from 40% to 10% (p<0.05); (ii) reduced the incidence of AS from 61% to 35% (p<0.05); (iii) attenuated the severity of the AS; and (iv) lowered mortality from 39% in the control to 19% in the Mg2+-treated group (p=0.1). Serum and tissue total [Mg2+] were not affected by the administration of MgCl2. Also, the serum and heart Mg2+ levels were the same whether or not the guinea-pigs developed AS or CM. In cell culture we demonstrated that by elevating the [Mg2+] in the medium bathing sensitized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] subsequent to antigen challenge was reduced from 174 ± 23.28% (1 mM) to 82.74 ± 13.22 % (3 mM). We conclude that a single treatment with Mg2+ can considerably diminish damage induced by immune stress, probably by its altering the Ca2+: Mg2+ratio. Since the physiological reaction to different types of stress is similar, Mg2 + could prove beneficial in preventing stress-induced shock in general. Studies examining the mechanisms by which Mg2 + exerts its effects thus provide a scientific basis for the current clinical use of Mg2 + in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and asthma.",

The aim of this study was to attain and sustain target levels of serum calcium and magnesium for three days following admission. METHODS: A single-blind, prospective, multicenter randomized study was conducted from 2019 to 2022 years, enrolling acute ICH patients aged 18-80 years, with radiological diagnosis and without surgical intervention. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the study group or the control group. In the study group, the target serum levels of calcium (9-10.2 mg/dL) and magnesium (2-3 mg/dL) were actively achieved and maintained for a duration of 3 days following admission. The primary outcome was the expansion of ICH volume within the first 3 days between the study group and the control groups. RESULTS: After implementing inclusion/exclusion criteria, 105 of 354 patients remained in the study. There were no significant differences in ICH volume on hospital days 2 and 3 between the groups. Admission factors including Glasgow coma scale score, hemoglobin level, ICH volume, and spot sign showed significant correlations in multivariate analysis. On the third day of hospitalization, admission serum magnesium levels showed a significant correlation with ICH expansion, whereas calcium levels did not. CONCLUSION: Admission serum magnesium levels were found to correlate with hematoma expansion in patients with acute ICH. While magnesium itself may not be a direct therapeutic target, it could serve as a valuable indicator for identifying potential therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing ICH volume increase.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between serum magnesium levels and the risk of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This retrospective single-centre cohort study analysed the medical records of patients. Neonates were categorised into two groups based on the presence or absence of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. Demographic factors including gender, gestational age, type of birth, birth weight, multiple pregnancies, medical treatment for duct closure or surgical ligation, length of hospital stay, and mortality and neonatal outcomes were compared between the groups. The relationship between serum magnesium levels at 24 hours of age and the risk of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus and other neonatal morbidities was assessed. RESULTS: This study found no significant relationship between symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus and serum magnesium levels. Additionally, no significant differences were observed between serum magnesium levels and ductal diameter, nor in the need for medical or surgical intervention for symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. However, neonates with serum magnesium levels greater than 3 mg/dL exhibited a significantly higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. Conversely, the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was significantly lower in this group, with both findings reaching statistical significance (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that while serum magnesium levels may not be a reliable marker for symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus, they could have clinical implications in the modulation of neonatal respiratory outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and assess the potential therapeutic role of magnesium in the management of neonatal morbidities."

Among them, 56 patients (control group) received MgSO4 alone, while 66 patients (research group) received a combination of LBT and MgSO4. Comparative analyses were conducted to evaluate therapeutic effectiveness, symptom improvement (edema, hypertension, and proteinuria), brain-related symptoms (nausea and vomiting, sluggishness, blurred vision, dizziness, and headache), pregnancy outcomes (placental abruption, neonatal asphyxia, fetal distress, and postpartum hemorrhage), blood pressure indicators (systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), fetal umbilical artery hemodynamics (systolic-to-diastolic flow velocity ratio (S/D) and pulsatility index (PI)), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). RESULTS: The research group demonstrated significantly better outcomes than the control group, including a higher overall therapeutic effectiveness rate, faster resolution of edema, hypertension, and proteinuria, a lower incidence of adverse pregnancy events, and more pronounced reductions in SBP, DBP, S/D, PI, and hs-CRP levels after treatment (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of LBT and MgSO4 is highly effective in improving symptoms and pregnancy outcomes in HDP patients, outperforming MgSO4 monotherapy. This approach has strong potential for broader clinical application."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biocompatibility of porous WE43 magnesium alloy scaffolds manufactured by 3D printing technology and to observe its effect in treating femoral defects in New Zealand white rabbits. METHODS: In vitro cytotoxicity test was performed using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from Sprague Dawley (S-D) rats. According to the different culture media, the cells were divided into 100% extract group, 50% extract group, 10% extract group and control group. After culturing for 1, 3 and 7 days, the cell activity of each group was determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). In the in vivo experiment, 3.0-3.5 kg New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: Experimental group, bone cement group and blank group, with 9 rabbits in each group. Each rabbit underwent surgery on the left lateral femoral condyle, and a bone defect with a diameter of 5 mm and a depth of 6 mm was created using a bone drill. The experimental group was implanted with WE43 magnesium alloy scaffolds, the bone cement group was implanted with calcium sulfate bone cement, and the blank group was not implanted. Then 4, 8 and 12 weeks after surgery, 3 rabbits in each group were euthanized by carbon dioxide anesthesia, and the femur and important internal organs were sampled. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) scanning was performed on the left lateral femoral condyle. Sections of important internal organs were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Hard tissue sections were made from the left lateral femoral condyle and stained with methylene blue acid fuchsin and observed under a microscope. RESULTS: In the cytotoxicity test, the cell survival rate in the 100% extract group was higher than that in the control group (140.56% vs. 100.00%, P < 0.05) on 1 day of culture; there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05) in cell survival rate among the groups on 3 days of culture; the cell survival rate in the 100% extract group was lower than that in the control group (68.64% vs. 100.00%, P < 0.05) on 7 days of culture. Micro-CT scanning in the in vivo experiment found that most of the scaffolds in the experimental group had been degraded in 4 weeks, with very few high-density scaffolds remaining. In 12 weeks, there was no obvious stent outline. In 4 weeks, a certain amount of gas was generated around the WE43 magnesium alloy scaffold, and the gas was significantly reduced from 8 to 12 weeks. Hard tissue sections showed that a certain amount of extracellular matrix and osteoid were generated around the scaffolds in the experimental group in 4 weeks. In the bone cement group, most of the calcium sulfate bone cement had been degraded. In 8 weeks, the osteoid around the scaffold and its degradation products in the experimental group increased significantly. In 12 weeks, new bone was in contact with the scaffold around the scaffold in the experimental group. There was less new bone in the bone cement group and the blank group. CONCLUSION: The porous WE43 magnesium alloy scaffold fabricated by 3D printing process has good biocompatibility and good osteogenic properties, and has the potential to become a new material for repairing bone defects.",

      "abstract": "europathic pain can arise from injury or illness affecting the somatosensory system. It can also be triggered by cancer or chemotherapy drugs like paclitaxel. Researchers have indicated that magnesium sulfate may help in preventing neuropathy. This study aimed to investigate the effect of magnesium sulfate on paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain by inhibiting the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Alpha - receptor-associated factor 6 - Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (TNF-α-TRAF6-NF-κB) axis. Twenty-four male rats were divided into four groups: experiment group (E)-1, E2, E3, and the control group (Co). The experimental groups and the control group received paclitaxel at a dosage of 8 mg/kg every other day, totaling four injections over seven days. In addition, magnesium sulfate was administered daily in three doses of 300, 150, and 75 mg/kg, amounting to seven injections over the course of seven days. On the seventh day, peripheral blood samples were collected from the rats, and sera were used for the analysis of TNF-α serum levels and MicroRNA-146a-5p expression using ELISA and qRT-PCR methods, respectively. The serum levels of TNF-α increased in the E1, E2, and E3 groups compared to the control group. However, there was a gradual decrease in the E1, E2 and E3 groups. The miR-146a-5p expression declined in the E1 group and increased in the E2 and E3 groups compared to the control group. This study demonstrated that administering 300 and 150 mg of magnesium sulfate decreased TNF-α synthesis and reduced the function of the TNF-α-TRAF6-NF-κB axis during the initiation step.",

      "abstract": "Operative treatment is an option for fractures when the fracture is unstable or the patient wishes to return early to daily life or social activities. Metal plates such as titanium and stainless steel are often used in fracture surgery, but the metal plate lacks bone-healing activity and is not bioabsorbable, requiring a second surgery to remove it after bone union. Here we show that a magnesium (Mg) plate made from an alloy of yttrium, zinc, and aluminum with magnesium as the main component in a long-period stacking ordered structure promotes bone formation in a rabbit tibia fracture model and is also bioabsorbable. We show that the Mg plate significantly promoted bone and callus formation compared to a titanium plate in the rabbit tibia fracture model. Moreover, the Mg plate was mostly bioabsorbed once bone union was achieved, but rabbits showed no evidence of biotoxic effects, such as weight loss or increased blood magnesium levels. We also demonstrate that treatment with exogenous magnesium significantly enhanced calcium deposition in an in vitro osteoblast culture system. Magnesium is an essential element, and its radiolucency facilitates observation of the fracture site during Mg plate fixation, while its lack of magnetic properties allows its use in patients who require MRI scans. Accordingly, we propose that a use of a Mg plate could be beneficial in treating bone fracture.",

      "abstract": "The magnesium ion is one of the divalent cations that have an important role in chromosome condensation. Research about the role of Mg2 + has been conducted on the chromosomes from various types of cells, especially human cancer cell lines. Nonetheless, no research has been conducted on normal human cells, such as blood cells and lymphocytes. Therefore, a study to evaluate the effect of Mg2+ on chromosome structure in normal cells is required. This study aims to assess the effects of Mg2+ on chromosome structure in lymphocytes using GTL-banding and karyotyping. Metaphase chromosomes were obtained by culturing blood cells, followed by banding using Giemsa and Leishman stain. Mg2+ role was assessed using XBE5 solution (5 mM Mg2+) as control, XBE solution (0 mM Mg2+), and 1 mM EDTA solution as a cation chelator. The chromosome value from each treatment was evaluated using Quality Assessment from the Association for Clinical Cytogenetics according to the International System for Human Cytogenomics Nomenclature (ISCN). The result shows that the control chromosome had a compact structure with a clear banding pattern and bold band intensity, while those treated with XBE and EDTA had a less compact and fibrous structure with an unclear banding pattern and thin band intensity. In addition, the average chromosome score±SD of the XBE (4.389 ± 0.607) and EDTA-treated (4.611 ± 0.607) chromosomes were higher than those of the control (4.222 ± 0.427). These data indicated that Mg2+ is essential in maintaining the structure of the human lymphocyte chromosome."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster is a common disease encountered in clinical practice. The neuropathic pain caused by herpes zoster can be severe enough to interfere with daily life in challenging cases. Although it is said that intervening as early as possible after the onset of the disease improves outcomes, there are some cases that are difficult to treat as immediate interventional therapy is not possible. While there are some reports on the efficacy of intravenous magnesium and lidocaine, we investigated the efficacy of intravenous magnesium and lidocaine in patients with herpes zoster neuritis and postherpetic neuralgia. Patient criteria: A total of 23 patients with herpes zoster neuritis and postherpetic neuralgia were included in the study. We included only cases in which immediate interventional therapy was not possible. METHODS: The treatment protocol was an intravenous infusion of a combination of 1.2 g of magnesium and 100 mg of lidocaine for one hour every week for four weeks (five times in total). Patients were assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain before and after the treatment at week zero and before the treatment at weeks one, two, three, and four. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the median NRS before treatment at week zero and the median NRS before treatment at week one. Similarly, there was a statistically significant difference between the median NRS before treatment at week zero and the median NRS before treatment at weeks two, three, and four. In addition, the NRS tended to decrease as the number of treatments increased. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous lidocaine and magnesium may be effective for herpes zoster neuritis and postherpetic neuralgia. It may be a treatment method for when immediate interventional therapy is not possible."

      "abstract": "Electric furnace nickel-iron slag is an industrial solid waste obtained by cooling the molten slag after the production of nickel and iron. Its main chemical components are SiO2, Fe2O3, and MgO. This study explores the impact of nickel-iron slag on the properties of magnesium sodium phosphate cement (MNPC), with the objective of addressing the environmental pollution caused by nickel-iron slag and reducing the cost of MNPC. Through experimentation, it has been found that as the content of nickel-iron slag increases, the volume deformation of MNPC is improved. When 30 % nickel-iron slag is added, the water resistance of the cement paste is significantly enhanced, and the porosity after 28 days of air curing is the lowest. Moreover, the compressive strength of all experimental groups gradually increases with the extension of water curing time. Specifically, MNPC with 30 % nickel-iron slag exhibits the highest compressive strength, the lowest strength loss rate, and the smallest porosity at 1 day, 3 days, and 28 days under both air and water curing conditions. The hydration products of MNPC are amorphous MgNaPO4・7H2O, while distinct crystalline peaks of MgNaPO4・7H2O are observed in MNPC containing nickel-iron slag, and the intensity of these peaks gradually increases with the curing time. The compressive strength of water - cured MNPC progressively increases with the curing duration, without any strength decline, and the intensity of the crystalline peaks of the hydration products also continues to strengthen. The innovation of this study lies in the effective utilization of nickel-iron slag in MNPC, which not only enhances the performance of MNPC but also provides a novel solution for the treatment of industrial waste and the development of sustainable materials."

      "abstract": "Large quantities of soil excavated from civil engineering projects are found to contain leachable contaminants, including metallic oxyanions like molybdate. This study presents a novel treatment approach by identifying a mixture of magnesium oxide (MgO) and hydraulic binders for the stabilization and solidification (S/S) of molybdenum-contaminated limestone tunnel sludge. XRD analysis and geochemical modeling revealed the presence of brucite in all samples, suggesting that the immobilization mechanism was likely molybdate sorption onto brucite. The addition of cement enhanced the geotechnical properties and improved sulfate retention through the formation of ettringite. Considering efficiency and a low CO2 footprint, the S/S formulation consisting of 1 wt% MgO and 3 wt% limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) was selected for this study. Environmental assessments were conducted using leaching test standards, including US EPA 1313 to assess pH sensitivity, US EPA 1311 (TCLP) and EN 12457-2 to evaluate the effects of curing time, at intervals from 6 hours to 90 days. Results showed that molybdenum release remained below 0.05 mg/L (the European inert waste threshold) after just 24 hours of curing, with further improvements over time under alkaline conditions. However, the treatment was ineffective at neutral or acidic pH due to brucite dissolution. The S/S of molybdenum-contaminated sludge using MgO and LC3 proved highly efficient for Mo immobilization and is suitable for industrial applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent, induces kidney magnesium wasting and hypomagnesemia. Recent studies suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors elevate serum magnesium concentration in patients with or without diabetes. We hypothesized that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin attenuates acute cisplatin-induced hypomagnesemia by acting on the thick ascending limb (TAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT), key sites of magnesium reabsorption. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats received weekly treatments of cisplatin (2.5 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle) for five weeks. After three weeks, rats were randomized to receive empagliflozin (10 mg/kg/day) or water (vehicle) for the next fifteen days. RESULTS: Cisplatin-treated rats developed significant hypomagnesemia with increased fractional excretion of magnesium (FEMg2+). Empagliflozin treatment reduced FEMg2+ and restored serum magnesium levels. In the TAL, cisplatin-treated rats had higher NKCC2 abundance but lower phosphorylated NKCC2 and claudin-16 levels than empagliflozin-treated cisplatin rats, whose protein levels were similar to controls. In contrast, claudin-19 abundance in the TAL was higher in cisplatin-treated rats than in controls and unaffected by empagliflozin treatment. In the DCT, cisplatin-treated rats displayed reduced abundance of the NaCl cotransporter (NCC), the magnesium channel TRPM6, and NCC phosphorylation, all of which were rescued by empagliflozin. Unexpectedly, cisplatin-treated rats exhibited higher mRNA expression and protein abundance of TRPM7 compared to empagliflozin-treated cisplatin rats, whose levels were similar to controls. Diuretic challenge tests with furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide confirmed reduced NKCC2 and NCC activity in cisplatin-treated rats. However, the natriuretic response to furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide did not differ between control and empagliflozin-treated cisplatin rats. Immunohistochemistry suggested that empagliflozin reversed cisplatin-induced DCT remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin reduces kidney magnesium wasting and restores serum magnesium in cisplatin-treated rats, likely through reversing NKCC2 inhibition and claudin-16 downregulation in the TAL while normalizing NCC function and restoring TRPM6 expression in the DCT."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hypomagnesemia and clotting disorders have been reported among people with diabetes especially those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Magnesium plays a crucial role in hemostasis and hypomagnesemia was found to increase the thrombotic risk. The patho-mechanism linking magnesium, clotting disorders, and diabetic microangiopathy in T1DM remains to be unraveled. Hence this study aimed to assess the magnesium level among children and adolescents with T1DM compared to healthy controls and to correlate it with coagulopathy markers and diabetic microangiopathy. METHODS: Forty-six children and adolescents with T1DM & 46 controls were assessed for serum magnesium, prothrombin time (PT), activated-partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and HbA1c. The Toronto clinical scoring system, fundus, urinary microalbumin, and serum fasting lipids were used to assess diabetic microangiopathy. RESULTS: Children and adolescents with T1DM have significantly lower magnesium, PT, aPTT, and significantly higher PAI-1 than controls (p<0.001), this is more evident in those having microangiopathy than those without (p<0.001). Serum magnesium is positively correlated with PT, aPTT, and HDL and negatively correlated with insulin daily dose, PAI-1, HbA1c, triglycerides, and urinary microalbumin. Multivariate-logistic regression revealed that diabetes duration, HbA1c, PT, aPTT, PAI-1, and urinary microalbumin were independently associated with serum magnesium among children and adolescents with T1DM (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with T1DM have lower magnesium levels than controls; that is more pronounced among those having microangiopathy. Low serum magnesium is associated with poor glycemic control, coagulopathy, and diabetic microangiopathy among children and adolescents with T1DM. Magnesium supplementation combined with standard insulin therapy in pediatric patients with T1DM is recommended for better glycemic control and prevention of diabetic microangiopathy.",

      "abstract": "Hypermagnesemia is often iatrogenic and special attention is required in patients taking magnesium oxide, particularly those with impaired renal function or gastrointestinal obstruction. We report a case of a 60-year-old man who developed obstructive ileus due to sigmoid colon cancer. He had been prescribed magnesium oxide (2000 mg/day) and magnesium citrate (34 g) preoperatively. Postoperatively, he exhibited prolonged muscle relaxation and delayed awakening. Blood gas analysis revealed a significantly elevated ionized magnesium level of 3.53 mmol/L (reference range: 0.45-0.67 mmol/L). Continuous hemodiafiltration was promptly initiated, leading to patient awakening on postoperative day one and transfer to the general ward on postoperative day three. Retrospective analysis confirmed a total serum magnesium level of 14.1 mg/dL (reference range: 1.8-2.4 mg/dL) immediately after surgery. In this case, magnesium oxide accumulation due to obstructive ileus, combined with renal impairment caused by septic shock, likely contributed to the development of hypermagnesemia. The use of a blood gas analyzer capable of measuring ionized magnesium allowed for early recognition and early therapeutic intervention. This case highlights the risk of hypermagnesemia even with short-term magnesium oxide use in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction or renal dysfunction. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of magnesium monitoring in critically ill patients and the utility of ionized magnesium measurement in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metal plates and screws are widely used as internal fixations in the treatment of ankle fracture. However, there are many disadvantages such as \"stress shielding\" effect and the need for secondary surgical removal, which potentially affected the blood supply around the fracture site. In recent years, many studies confirmed that the biodegradable high purity magnesium (Mg) screws exhibited sufficient mechanical strength with adequate degradation rate for effective bone healing, avoiding the need for implant removal operations. METHOD: We conducted a prospective study on patients with ankle fractures treated at Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University between January 2020 and January 2021. Twenty-four patients (twelve patients for each group) with ankle fractures were treated with high purity Mg screws or conventional titanium alloy plates and screws. Hematological examinations were performed in the early postoperative period, X-ray examinations were performed in the long-term postoperative follow-up. Postoperative complications, including infection, failure of internal fixation and malunion, were recorded during the follow-up. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate postoperative pain perceived by the patients, and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scoring system was used to evaluate their postoperative ankle function. RESULTS: All patients achieved good fracture alignment, and imaging examination showed that the biodegradable high purity Mg screws degraded gradually without breakage or displacement. None of the patients experienced infection, failure of internal fixation, malunion or other complications in both groups. CONCLUSION: The results showed that biodegradable high purity Mg screws could be effectively used in the clinical treatment of ankle fractures, ensuring safety and satisfactory postoperative functional recovery.The translational potential of this article: The biodegradable high purity Mg screws could provide sufficient mechanical strength and fixation stability for ankle fracture. Our study extended the clinical application of the biodegradable high purity Mg screws for fracture."

However, the most commonly used collagen barrier membranes usually have poor mechanical properties and are prone to collapse during clinical use. Herein, a sandwich-like barrier membrane was developed with crosslinked chitosan as dense layer, crosslinked collagen as loose layer and passivated magnesium mesh as the skeleton. Surface modification has improved the corrosion resistance of magnesium mesh. Thanks to the introduction of magnesium mesh skeleton and crosslinking modification, the mechanical properties and supporting effects of barrier membrane have been improved. The dense layer of barrier membrane showed dense structure while the loose layer showed porous structure as expected. The barrier membrane showed good antibacterial performance against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria owing to the antibacterial activity of chitosan and the added chlorhexidine acetate. Furthermore, the barrier membrane met the requirements of biocompatibility for implanted biomaterials. Interestingly, the barrier membrane had good anti-inflammatory activity to accelerate the transition from inflammatory to proliferative stage and can promote osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Overall, the sandwich-like barrier membrane has a wide application prospect to guide bone regeneration."

The underlying mechanisms involve oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and disruptions in copper/iron homeostasis. This study introduces magnesium hexacyanoferrate (MgHCF) as a novel compound and explores its therapeutic potential in SAE. Our investigation reveals that MgHCF features intriguing properties in effectively scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), and chelating excess copper and iron. Treatment with MgHCF significantly attenuates microglia activation, and protects neuronal cells from oxidative damage and cytotoxicity induced by activated microglia in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the cognitive impairment in SAE mice is effectively alleviated by MgHCF treatment, mechanically through a reduction in the copper/iron-responsive histone methylation, and neuronal cuproptosis. These findings suggest MgHCF as a promising therapeutic agent for SAE, targeting the copper/iron signaling pathway to alleviate neuroinflammation, and neuronal cuproptosis."

Diabetes was observed in 4 cases, obesity in 4 cases and hyperuricemia in 7. Alkalinizing treatment achieved complete dissolution of the stone in 12 cases and almost complete or partial dissolution in other 6. A combination of potassium magnesium citrate, theobromine, zinc and vitamin A was used in all the cases.  In 4 cases the administration of allopurinol was associated. In one case with obstructive ureteral stones, stone dissolution was obtained with the combined administration of bicarbonate via nephrostomy and intravenous bicarbonate and oral treatment with citrates.  Stone dissolution of uric acid stones has also been described in some specific clinical conditions such as Crohn's disease with ileostomy, outcome of partial nephrectomy, cross-fused renal ectopia. Alkalinization was also used to prevent encrustation of a self-expanding metallic ureteral stent. Alkalinization has also been employed during the period of Mitomycin administration for the treatment of non-muscle infiltrating bladder tumors and for the treatment of overactive bladder. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of these case reports demonstrate that urinary alkalinization with frequent monitoring of urinary pH ​can be successfully employed in the non-surgical treatment of uric acid stones of different sizes in various locations.",

For the synthesized Li-rich material, the conventional ex situ doping strategy can only incorporate heteroatoms in the outer particles, diminishing benefits for the internal structure of secondary particles. Recently, in situ doping has been employed to influence topological lithiation and achieve well-distribution in the bulk structure. However, the mechanisms of in/ex situ doping on elevating electrochemical performance for Li-rich material are ambiguous. Herein, by introducing magnesium (Mg2+) ions on the precursor and synthesized Li-rich material, the in situ Mg doping (LRO-Mg1) and the ex situ Mg doping (LRO-Mg2) samples are successfully designed. Characterizations shows that Mg ion tend to incorporate into the Li-rich bulk structure for in situ doping, while they enrich in the surface for ex situ doping. Electrochemical measurement manifest that the in situ Mg doping Li-rich cathode exhibits more elevated high-rate performance, while the ex situ doping Li-rich cathode exhibits more elevated specific capacity, illuminating that enhances bulk structure of Li-rich cathode through in situ doping strategy is more effective than the surface modification (ex situ doping). Ex situ doping may be more effective for surface treatment, contributing to specific capacity improvement."

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), magnesium, and tryptophan are associated with FM symptoms, but their combined effects in this condition are poorly understood. The objective of the study was to assess the effects of CoQ10, tryptophan, and magnesium supplementation in patients with FM. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, two-sequence crossover study included adult patients diagnosed with FM for at least two years. The study comprised two periods of three months each, and a one-month washout period between them. Participants were randomized to receive the dietary supplement or placebo. The primary endpoint was the change in the item fatigue of the combined index of fibromyalgia impact in patients (ICAF). Secondary outcomes included changes in the remaining ICAF factors and items and in the total score. Of 110 enrolled patients, 89 (mean age: 51.0 years; 96.6% women) completed the study. Most participants (94.4%) were on pharmacological treatment for FM. Fatigue improved significantly in the placebo group, with a non-significant reduction in the dietary supplement group. Pain intensity significantly decreased in both groups, while sleep quality and functional impact showed a significant reduction in the dietary supplement group. The ICAF total score improved significantly after 3 months of receiving the dietary supplement. Adverse events (n = 35) were mild and homogenously distributed between groups. The dietary supplement was efficacious in improving physical aspects of FM, including pain, sleep quality, and impact, and showed good tolerability.",

The cell viability and osteointegrative properties of alloy-derived Mg AZ31+SPF and Mg AZ31+SPF+HT extracts were investigated regarding their effect on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) (maintained in basal (BM) and osteogenic medium (OM)) after 7 and 14 days of treatment. The viability was analyzed through metabolic activity and double-strand DNA quantification, while the osteoinductive effects were evaluated through qRT-PCR, osteoimage, and BioPlex investigations. Finally, a preliminary liquid mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on the secretome of hMSCs. Biocompatibility analysis revealed no toxic effect on cells' viability or proliferation during the experimental period. A modulation effect was observed on the osteoblast pre-commitment genes of hMSCs treated with Mg-AZ31+SPF+HT in OM, which was supported by mineralization nodule analysis. A preliminary mass spectrometry investigation highlighted the modulation of protein clusters involved in extracellular exosomes, Hippo, and the lipid metabolism process. In conclusion, our results revealed that the Mg AZ31+SPF+HT extracts can modulate the canonical and non-canonical osteogenic process in vitro, suggesting their possible application in bone tissue engineering."

      "abstract": "Nanotechnology has been utilized in diverse domains, encompassing sustainable agriculture. However, the ecotoxicity and environmental safety of nanoparticles need to be evaluated before their large-scale use. This study synthesizes and characterizes magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) co-doped aluminum (Al) oxide (MgZnAl2O4) NPs and elucidates its potential growth-promoting or genotoxic performance on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). XRD, EDX, TEM, SEM, and XPS were used to characterize the MgZnAl2O4 NPs. After characterization, the seedlings were grown in a hydroponic solution containing 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg L-1 NPs for 3 weeks. The germination, growth indices, photosynthetic parameters, and nutrient absorption properties were determined. Confocal microscopy, TEM, and SEM were utilized to follow the path and reveal the structural and morphological effects of NPs. The potential genotoxic effect was evaluated using the RAPD-PCR method. Elemental composition analysis of plant parts confirmed that synthesized MgZnAl2O4 NPs, sized at 21.8 nm, were up-taken by the plant roots, leading to increased Mg, Zn, and Al contents of leaves. In addition, compared with the untreated control, the abundance of Ca, K, B, Fe, Mn, and Cu were increased by the NPs treatment. In addition, physiological indices like germination rate (~ 11%), root and leaf growth (15-29%), chlorophyll, and carotenoids (~ 39%) pigments were significantly raised by the NPs inclusion. It can be concluded that low concentrations (< 200 mg L-1) of MgZnAl2O4 NPs enhance growth parameters effectively and are safe for plant growth. On the other hand, a phytotoxic and genotoxic impact was observed at high concentrations (100-400 mg L-1). However, considerable amounts of NPs were found to be adsorbed on roots, disrupting root morphology and cell membrane integrity, thus nutrient trafficking and transport. Therefore, it is recommended that MgZnAl2O4 NPs can be used in barley breeding programs at low concentrations. Adding micro- or macroelements required by plants to the NP composition is a promising way to compensate for plant nutrition. However, the negative effects of MgZnAl2O4 NPs on the environment and other living beings due to their genotoxic effects at high doses must be carefully considered.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both diabetes and low magnesium-containing food intake may increase the risk of heart failure (HF). However, the effect of nonprescription magnesium supplements on the risk of HF or major adverse cardiac events in patients with diabetes is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a target-trial-emulation approach, we assembled a national cohort of 94 239 veterans ≥40 years with diabetes, without prior HF or magnesium use, who received ambulatory care in the US veterans-health care system documented by electronic clinic notes between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2020. A natural language processing approach was used to detect self-reported magnesium-supplement use from clinic notes, n=17 619 were identified as users versus n=76 620 as nonusers. Using inverse probability treatment weighting, we constructed a cohort balanced in 88 baseline characteristics between users and nonusers. The primary outcome was incident HF. Secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke, HF hospitalization, or death). Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with magnesium-supplement use and outcomes were estimated in the inverse probability treatment weighting weighted cohort using Cox regression. The inverse probability treatment weighting weighted cohort had a mean age of 67.4±10.3 years; 18.4% were Black, and 5.1% were women. The mean duration of magnesium-supplement use was 3.5±3.1 (interquartile range, 1.1-5.1) years. Incident HF occurred in 8.0% of users and 9.7% of nonusers of magnesium supplements (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.89-0.99]). Magnesium-supplement use was also associated with a reduced risk of major adverse cardiac events (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.97]). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term nonprescription magnesium supplement use was associated with a lower risk of incident HF and major adverse cardiac events in patients with diabetes. These findings should be replicated in randomized controlled trials.",

This study aims to explore further and develop a membrane that might overcome these limitations and aid in bone regeneration for the treatment of bony defects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgONPs) were prepared from magnesium nitrate prepared by calcination at different temperatures and dried using filter paper under specific temperature. Later, 0.3 ml of 0.2 M 1% acetic acid was added to water and placed in the stirrer for at least 1 h. Chitosan (CS) (2%) of two different concentrations containing 0.588 g and 0.576 g of CS, respectively, was prepared and added to the previous mixture. To these concentrations, the prepared MgONPs were added and stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 1 h. Later, it was cast in the mold and dried. The prepared membrane was immersed in 1 M sodium hydroxide to neutralize acetic acid. After preparation, they were subjected to scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and contact angle test. RESULTS: In SEM analysis, spherical in size, uniformly dense, and porous agglomeration was noticed. EDAX and FTIR revealed the formation of MgONPs (magnesium oxide) in the membrane. The average contact angles of the CS with MgONPs and control membranes were 85.48° and 80.80°, respectively. Degradation analysis showed that test membrane showed a slower degradation rate than control collagen membrane at the end of the 28th day. CONCLUSION: On comparing membranes with pure CS, membranes with nanoparticles, and control collagen membranes, the membrane incorporated with nanoparticles showed more favorable positive outcomes."

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a fatal malignant tumor that occurs in bone, whose main treatment is surgical resection. With anti-tumor and osteogenic effects, Magnesium (Mg) is a promising biodegradable metal for postoperative treatment in OS, however, its anti-OS effect and mechanism still need to be explored. Here, while holding the ability to promote osteogenesis, Mg metal at the same time significantly reduces the proliferation, migration and invasion of various OS cells (UMR106, 143B, K7M2) in vitro. Similarly, it inhibits the growth and lung metastasis of UMR106 induced tumors in xenograft models in vivo. The mRNA-seq analysis shows that Mg significantly inhibits Wnt-pathway (increased APC, Axin2 and GSK3β to induce degradation of β-catenin) in typical OS, which is further verified by western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. A Mg2+ concentration of 240 mg/L, either from Mg metal extract or Mg salt (MgCl2), equivalently exhibits significantly increased APC, Axin2, GSK3β and decreased β-catenin, and then inhibits tumorigenicity of typical OS cells. This work reveals that a local high concentration of Mg can inhibit OS by down-regulating Wnt-pathway, and meanwhile favors for normal health bone, which demonstrates a new approach and mechanism in the treatment of OS with Mg-based biodegradable metals.",

However, in intractable muscle diseases such as volumetric muscle loss (VML), the quantity and function of MuSCs are significantly reduced, severely limiting the body's inherent muscle regeneration capability. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to modulate the fate of MuSCs using a combination of bioactive magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) ions, sustainably delivered through magnesium silicate (MgSiO3, MS) bioceramic-based scaffolds. In vitro, Mg and Si ions synergistically promote the proliferation and differentiation of MuSCs. Similarly, Mg and Si ions derived from MS/poly(L-lactic acid) (MS/PLLA) composite scaffold also increase the proliferation and differentiation ability of MuSCs. Furthermore, MS/PLLA composite scaffolds facilitate the activation of MuSCs, regeneration of muscle fiber and neovascularization, while inhibiting fibrosis, thereby effectively restoring muscle function and promoting tibialis anterior muscle functional regeneration in a VML mouse model. Mechanistically, the combination of Mg and Si ions promotes the activation and proliferation of MuSCs by activating the Notch1-Hes1 pathway. Besides, the combination of Mg and Si ions also improves the differentiation of MuSCs by up-regulating Myod and Myog, and enhances fusion by up-regulating Mymk and Mymx expression. The outcomes of our research introduce a promising approach to the treatment of skeletal muscle injuries and related diseases."

Hence, it is necessary to consider the treatment of the tumor and repair of the jawbone, and the treatment process is very complicated. However, conventional therapy for OSCC mainly emphasizes tumor removal, which often fails to address the repair of jawbone defects and destroys residual tumor cells after treatment. METHODS: In this study, we designed a composite hydrogel platform (SUMg) of sodium alginate loaded upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) and magnesium particles (MPs), in which UCNP was coated with folic acid and chlorin e6 to prepare UFC. The physicochemical and biological properties of the prepared SUMg, including swelling test, element mapping, cell behaviors, in vivo osteogenic bioactivity and antitumor effect, were comprehensively evaluated. RESULTS: In vitro, SUMg exhibited high cytocompatibility and promoted cell viability, proliferation, spreading, and osteogenesis owing to the incorporation of MPs, with SU10 Mg having the most significant effect. Under 980 nm laser irradiation, UFC induced a photodynamic therapy effect and destroyed surviving tumor cells. In vivo experiments further confirmed that SU10 Mg could promote bone regeneration, and under 980 nm near-infrared irradiation, the UFC produced local reactive oxygen species in the tumor within 5 min. DISCUSSION: This work demonstrated the potential of SUMg in bone regeneration and inhibition of tumor growth, providing valuable insight for OSCC treatment."

      "abstract": "Critical-sized bone defects pose notable therapeutic challenges and often require extensive bone grafts for effective intervention, leading to a substantial medical burden. The scarcity of autologous bone and the complex architecture of trabecular bone necessitate the development of cost-effective biomimetic graft materials. In this study, we developed a MgO nanoparticle-incorporated hydrogel scaffold (P-G-C-MgO2) using a freeze-induced phase separation approach. The scaffold achieved a porous structure with 56.48 ± 7.062 % porosity and an average pore size of 565.7 ± 53.62 μm, closely mimicking natural trabecular bone. It demonstrated exceptional mechanical stability during degradation and consistently released bioactive components, including Mg2+, type I collagen, and gelatin. These features facilitated early cell recruitment and osteogenic differentiation. In a distal femoral bone defect model, P-G-C-MgO2 exhibited excellent osseointegration and significantly enhanced new bone regeneration. This biomimetic design offers a promising solution for bone defect repair. Moreover, it established a novel phase-separation-based strategy for fabricating porous hydrogel scaffolds."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with complex proximal humerus fractures (PHFs) have a higher complication rate when treated with locking compression plate (LCP) alone. This increased complication rate may be due to humeral head collapse and insufficient medial column support in the proximal humerus. In response, we proposed the use of bionic porous 3D-printed magnesium alloy scaffolds (MAS) in combination with LCP for the treatment of PHFs. The aim of this study is to compare the biomechanical characteristics of the LCP alone versus LCP-MAS fixation constructs in treating PHFs with medial column instability. METHODS: A three-dimensional model of a PHF with medial column instability was developed using computed tomography, and fixation was applied using LCP and LCP-MAS. Finite element analysis was employed to evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of these two fixation models, focusing on construct stiffness, von Mises stress distribution, and fracture displacements. RESULTS: The construct stiffness of the LCP-MAS fixation construct was approximately 3.50 to 7.30 times greater than that of the LCP fixation construct under normal bone conditions, and 2.60 to 4.90 times greater under osteoporotic bone conditions. The LCP-MAS fixation reduced the maximum von Mises stress on the implants by at least 70 %-80 %. Furthermore, the LCP-MAS fixation significantly minimized fracture displacement compared to LCP alone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the additional use of MAS can significantly enhance both the overall and local stability of PHFs. Thus, the LCP-MAS fixation approach presents a viable alternative for the treatment of PHFs.",

      "abstract": "Background and purpose Magnesium (Mg) has a biomechanical character resembling bone, with mechanical strength exceeding that of ceramics, but has a high corrosion rate. One method to reduce the corrosion level of Mg is to mix it with other materials or coatings. Carbonate apatite (CA) was chosen as a Mg composite mixture because of its good osteoconductivity, and this study aimed to evaluate the biodegradability of MgxCA composite implants made by the extrusion technique in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Methods This study was a post-test only in vivo experiment in SD rats from July to December 2021. Thirty SD rats were divided into five treatment groups: Mg0CA, Mg5CA, Mg10CA, Mg15CA, and titanium plates. The examination included implant weight changes, postoperative gas formation, and local and systemic histopathological analyses on days 15 and 30. Results There was a significant difference in gas formation on day 15 and implant degeneration between groups (p < 0.05). However, in post-hoc analysis, we found no significant differences in implant weight difference or implant gas production between pre- and post-sacrifice in the MgxCA composites (p > 0.05). Histopathological examination revealed no significant local or systemic inflammatory response differences between groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion The combination of magnesium with apatite carbonate from extruded fabrication techniques is a biodegradable implant with biocompatibility and nontoxic properties, either locally or systemically.",

Magnesium's rapid degradation, which can be finely tuned to achieve the controlled release required for AMD treatment, along with its well-established biocompatibility and biodegradable properties, positioning it as an ideal material for these applications. The study aimed to evaluate magnesium's potential as a carrier for ocular drug delivery systems by demontrating the stability of monoclonal antibodies, specifically bevacizumab, in the presence of magnesium corrosion products and the biocompatibility of these products with various cell lines, including murine fibroblasts (3T3), rat retinal Müller cells, and human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE19). The stability of bevacizumab with pure magnesium (Mg) was investigated through an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocol, developed and customized for this specific aim. The biocompatibility of Mg corrosion products was assessed by toxicological evaluations through MTT and Trypan Blue Viability assays, along with cell cycle analysis. Results demonstrated no significant impact of Mg corrosion products on bevacizumab stability, with changes in mean values consistently below or equal to 10%. Furthermore, Mg extracts showed minimal cytotoxicity, as metabolic activity exceeded 80% across all cell lines, classified as Grade 0/1 cytotoxicity under ISO 10993-5 standards. Cell viability, proliferation, and morphology remained unaffected for up to 72 h of exposure. This study provides the firstin vitroevaluation of bevacizumab's stability in the presence of magnesium corrosion products and its biocompatibility with retinal cell lines, laying the foundation for future ophthalmic research and underscoring magnesium's potential as a material for intraocular drug delivery systems.",

Intravenous magnesium sulfate (IVMg) may help severely ill children avoid hospitalization when added to standard treatment in an emergency department (ED), but this has not been adequately evaluated in a large trial. We conducted a pilot trial to test procedures and gather information to plan a large multicenter trial. METHODS: Children 2-17 years old with severe acute asthma were randomized in a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial of placebo (saline, 1 mL/kg, max 40 mL), low-dose IVMg (50 mg/kg, max 2 g), or high-dose IVMg (75 mg/kg, max 3 g) in addition to standard asthma therapy at the EDs of three tertiary pediatric hospitals between September 2022 and May 2023. We assessed the feasibility of delivering study drug within 90 min of treatment (defined as the start of the first inhaled albuterol) and monitoring for hypotension and obtained blood samples for pharmacologic analysis. Our target enrollment was one participant per site per week (90 total). RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were randomized, and 49 received study drug. Median (Q1, Q3) participant age was 6.3 (4.6, 9.6) years and 35 (67.3%) were male. Among 52 randomized participants, study drug was delivered within 90 min to 34 (65.4%), 486/542 (89.7%) anticipated blood pressure measurements were within time frames, 138/156 (88.5%) anticipated blood samples were obtained, and 38 (73.1%) were hospitalized. Hypotension was measured within 2 h of study drug administration in 2/18 (11.1%) who received placebo and 2/31 (6.5%) who received IVMg. CONCLUSIONS: Most anticipated blood pressure measurements and blood samples were obtained. Hypotension occurred at rates similar to previous reports. Lower-than-expected enrollment (related to low patient volumes) and timely delivery of study drug will require consideration for a larger trial."

Magnesium nutrition can improve the quality and yield of tea plants, but its regulatory role in the biosynthesis of EGCG in tea plants has not been clarified. Herein, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the metabolomics and transcriptomics of the shoots of 'Huangdan' at five magnesium concentrations: L1-L5 (0, 0.15, 0.45, 0.6, and 0.9 mmol/L mg2+, respectively). The results showed that the EGCG content of tea shoots treated with low magnesium concentrations was higher compared to those treated with high magnesium concentrations. The contents of related metabolites such as p-coumaric acid and cyanide in the EGCG synthesis pathway increased in the L4 and L5 treatment groups, while those of dihydroquercetin, dinnamic acid, and epicatechin increased significantly in the L2 and L3 treatment groups. Under the influence of magnesium treatment, the biosynthesis of EGCG was affected by a series of structural genes: CsPAL (HD.01G0005520), HD.02G0024350), Cs4CL (HD.15G0008250, HD.13G0010220), CsDFR (HD.04G0026220), CsANS(HD.12G0016700) with CsaroDE (HD.03G0002480)-positive regulation, and CsPAL (HD.13G0009900, HD.06G0008610), CsC4H (HD.06G0017130), Cs4CL (HD.02G0027390, HD.04G0003270), CsCHS (HD.10G0022640), CsCHI (HD.01G0011100), CsF3'H (HD.15G0015490), CsF3'5'H (HD.13G0004300), CsANS (HD.07G0023630), and Csaro B (HD.01G0028400) with CsSCPL (HD.01G0041070)-negative regulation. Transcription factors MYB 44 and WRKY 17 may play a key role in EGCG biosynthesis, which is significantly induced by magnesium nutrition in tea tree shoots. This study elucidates the effect of magnesium nutrition on EGCG biosynthesis in tea plants and provides key candidate transcription factors to provide a reference for further research on high-EGCG tea varieties to improve tea quality."

This study aimed to evaluate what is the difference in short- and long-term neonatal outcome comparing magnesium sulphate in small dose (4 g) versus controls. METHODS: Prospective cohort study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology over a period of 4 years. Group A comprised of the study group (intravenous 4 g magnesium sulphate was given over 20 min). Group B consisted of control group who did not receive magnesium sulphate. RESULTS: The study population comprised of 116 pregnant women who received intravenous bolus of 4 grams MgSO4 while the control group comprised of 95 pregnant women who did not receive MgSO4. Fewer neonates in the MgSO4 group required intubation at birth (32% vs. 52%) or chest compression (4% vs. 6%); however, the difference was not statistically significantly (p = 0.175 and p = 0.329). Neonatal brain ultrasound done in first month showed a significant reduction intraventricular haemorrhage of severe grade 3-4 IVH in the MgSO4 group (p = 0.016). MgSO4 administration was associated with a decrease in neonatal mortality before discharge (p = 0.039). Follow-up at 3 years showed a significant reduction in delayed milestones, visual impairment, Bayley score < 85 (p = 0.015). MgSO4 treatment antenatally was associated with lower risk of Cerebral Palsy (2.6% vs. 23.2%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The benefits from single smaller dose magnesium sulphate 4 gram prove its potential to be used for foetal neuroprotection in any healthcare setting without any maternal concerns."

This study aimed to assess the influence of the OCT-derived underlying plaque characteristics on in-scaffold late lumen loss (LLL) in patients treated with RMS up to 12-months. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the BIOMAG-I trial and who underwent OCT imaging before and after the index procedure were included in the current analysis. The acquired intravascular imaging data were evaluated to assess the presence of fibrous, calcific, or lipidic lesions. We calculated the proportions of each plaque feature per pullback and assessed their correlation with LLL obtained at 6- and 12-months follow-up. In addition, we investigated the potential impact of scaffold edge dissection and strut malapposition on in-scaffold LLL. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients and 84 lesions were evaluated in the current analysis. There was no significant correlation between the underlying plaque characteristic and in-scaffold LLL at 6-months (p = 0.79 for fibrous, p = 0.88 for calcific, p = 0.67 for lipid lesions). This trend was similar at 12 months follow-up (p = 0.56 for fibrous, p = 0.75 for calcific, p = 0.69 for lipid lesions). The presence or absence of edge dissection did not influence the degree of in-scaffold - (p = 0.51 at 6-months, p = 0.68 at 12-months follow-up) or in-segment LLL (p = 0.88 at 6-months, p = 0.70 at 12-months follow-up). CONCLUSION: The underlying plaque characteristics, edge dissection or strut malapposition had no significant impact on in-scaffold LLL following DREAMS 3 G implantation up to 12 months. This suggests better device performance irrespective of the underlying plaque characteristics. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04157153."

However, Mg deficiency is underdiagnosed and often underrecognized in the ambulatory health care setting, and nutrition education and training are often limited for health care providers (HCPs). Methods: A clinical guideline for detecting and treating Mg deficiency in the ambulatory care setting was developed. A pilot study was conducted in which HCPs received education on Mg and completed pre-test and post-test questionnaires to assess the intervention efficacy of the guideline. Results: Ten HCPs participated in the pilot study via telephone or face-to-face session. In general, there was a statistically significant increase in Mg knowledge among HCPs, due to the intervention of presentation of the guideline, with a nonsignificant increase in clinical practice application. However, the 1-month follow-up survey results showed that HCPs were likely to incorporate Mg assessment and treatment tools from the guideline in their future practice. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the use of the proposed clinical guideline may increase HCP knowledge and improve the diagnosis and treatment of Mg deficiency. Further use, development, and evaluation of this guideline is warranted.",

The effects of Mg@FA dosage, adsorption time, and methylene blue concentration on the adsorption of methylene blue by Mg@FA and pH values were analyzed. The adsorption characteristics of Mg@FA on methylene blue were investigated by adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, and adsorption thermodynamics, as well as SEM, EDS, XRD, BET, and FTIR. The results showed that when the dosage of Mg@FA was 1.0 g, the adsorption time was 120 min, and the initial concentration of methylene blue was 150 mg/L; the adsorption efficiency of methylene blue by Mg@FA was the highest, which was 95.61%. When the pH of the methylene blue solution was in the range of 7-11, the adsorption efficiency of Mg@FA for methylene blue remained stable at 95.61-98.10%. The adsorption process of methylene blue by Mg@FA follows the second-order kinetic fitting model and Langmuir model. The adsorption of methylene blue by Mg@FA is a spontaneous and endothermic reaction. Mg@FA adsorbs methylene blue through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. Mg@FA can effectively adsorb methylene blue and promote the waste utilization of fly ash, which provides a promising method for wastewater treatment and fly ash utilization."

      "abstract": "Magnesium alloys are often used in bone repair surgeries due to their biodegradability and excellent elastic modulus, making them a promising alternative to traditional nondegradable implants like titanium alloys. However, their rapid degradation rate limits their use as implants in the body. To enhance the corrosion resistance and bioactivity of magnesium alloys, we applied an ultrasonic spray coating on microarc oxidized (MAO) AZ31 magnesium alloy, using a mixture of silk fibroin (SF) and nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp). This SF/nHAp composite embeds directly into the micropores on the MAO-treated surface without additional physical or chemical treatment, forming a stable interlocked coating structure. The effects of different spray parameters on coating adhesion and interface characteristics were investigated, leading to the development of a corrosion-resistant and highly biocompatible composite coating. Further biological evaluations were conducted through subcutaneous implantation, assessing the in vivo degradation of the samples and the surrounding tissue response from multiple perspectives. A novel concept of in vivo tissue-reactive coatings was proposed, suggesting that highly biocompatible coating materials, in the early stages postimplantation, enable surrounding fibrous tissues to closely adhere to the surface, thereby slowing material degradation. As a result, the highly bioactive MAO-SF/nHAp coating significantly enhances the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys, reduces hydrogen evolution, promotes regeneration of surrounding tissues, and minimizes postimplant inflammation. This approach offers a new strategy to improve the biocompatibility and corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys in vivo, suggesting that the overall evaluation of biodegradable magnesium alloys should focus more on assessing in-body corrosion.",

Moringa plants are considered one of the most important medicinal plants that humans need for nutrition. The aim of the study is to provide Mg to plants in an easy and simple way. Therefore, it is widely available in human food due to its nutritional importance. In this experiment, the treatment was done on the Moringa plant as, one of the medicinal plants that is increasingly used in fresh form. The experiment was conducted at the research farm of the National Research Center. Magnesium oxide has been extracted and prepared in a natural way that is safe for humans, plants, and soil. Trichoderma viride filtrate was used as a chelating agent in an environmentally friendly process to create magnesium oxide nanoparticle (MgO-NPs). FTIR, TEM, and SEM-EDX were utilized to analyze and characterize the synthesized. Plants were treated with different doses to determine the optimal concentration for the plant. The effect of treatment on plants was to improve vegetation such, as a number of leaves (232.15), leaf area (273.97 cm2), and fresh weight (3693.17 g). It also increased dry matter in the plant (171.8 g), chemical properties, and elements.",

Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the role of calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and vitamin D (Vit-D) supplementation as complementary therapies for hypertension, focusing on their effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined relevant 6509 articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to October 2024. The primary outcome was the difference in blood pressure measurements (systolic and diastolic) and the pulse rate. The extracted data were analyzed using Open Meta Analyst software. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis included 40 studies; of them, 24 studies were analyzed. Ca++ was associated with a significant drop in the DBP (MD: -2.04, 95% CI [-3.39, -0.69], P = 0.01), but not in the SBP (P = 0.34) or pulse rate (P = 0.84). Mg++ significantly reduced DBP (MD: -1.64, 95% CI [-3.19, -0.09], P = 0.04), but had no significant effect on the SBP (P = 0.16) or pulse rate (P = 0.81). The estimated effect of Vit-D showed a significant reduction in SBP (MD: -2.83, 95% CI [-5.47, -0.199], P = 0.04) and DBP (MD: -1.64, 95% CI [-2.97, -0.3], P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Ca++ and Mg++ significantly reduced DBP but had no significant effect on SBP or the pulse rate. Whereas, vitamin D significantly reduced SBP and DBP.",

      "abstract": "The regeneration and repair of natural bone is a complex and multifaceted process. Potentially, multifunctional scaffolds that exhibit synergistic effects of various biological activities and align with the dynamic bone healing process, are highly expected to achieve desirable bone repairing outcomes. Bioavailable magnesium (Mg) is an essential element taking part in bone regeneration via promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Polyphenol gallic acid (GA) is an anti-inflammatory molecule that can modulate immune microenvironment. To control their release behaviors, Mg2+ and GA can react with each other to form metal-organic frameworks (MOF), which are then embedded into conductive porous scaffolds made of gelatin cryogel and poly(3,4-ethyldioxyethiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). In in vitro cell culture, the MOF-integrated conductive scaffold can simultaneously provide sustained supply of Mg2+ and GA to modulate the biological responses of a variety of cells. In in vivo evaluations, it shows remarkably enhanced new bone formation, as compared to groups of only MOF-contained non-conductive scaffold or conductive scaffold without MOF in rat calvarial defect model. In summary, conductive scaffold associated with sustained release of bioactive factors can serve as an effective treatment for inducing neo-bone growth benefiting from the synergistical contributions of diverse bioactive factors."

This study evaluated the effect of perioperative intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate on brain damage caused by neurosurgery. METHODS: Prospective randomized double-blind controlled study. Fifty adult patients undergoing supratentorial neurosurgery (25 were assigned to magnesium sulfate group and 26 to the control group). On arrival to the operating room, the intervention group received intravenous magnesium sulfate, 4 g bolus in 100 mL of 0.9% saline solution lasting 20 min followed by 20 g in 1000 mL saline lasting 24 h. The control group received the same volume of saline. Serum S100B-protein levels 2 h after surgery was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were neuron-specific enolase, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, neuropsychological testing, Glasgow Outcome Scale, and mortality, during hospital stay and at six and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in the primary outcome were not found. At six months, MRI showed a mean surgical cavity volume of 10.0 cm3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-15.6) in the magnesium group vs. 26.9 cm3 (95% CI 13.8-39.9) in controls (P=0.02), gliosis/edema in 55% vs. 90.5% (P=0.014), and contrast enhancement around the cavity in 33.3% vs. 80% (P=0.041), respectively. Patients in the magnesium group showed better scores in some neuropsychological tests. There were no relevant adverse effects in magnesium group. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical patients treated with supplemental magnesium sulfate showed macroscopic improvement in some MRI parameters related to blood-brain barrier permeability and better performance in some focal cognitive domain.",

      "abstract": "In orthopedics, the effective treatment of bone defects remains a major challenge. Magnesium (Mg) metals, with their excellent biocompatibility and favorable osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, and osseointegration properties, hold great promise for addressing this issue. However, the rapid degradation rate of magnesium restricts its clinical application. In this study, a triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS)-structured porous magnesium alloy (Mg-Nd-Zn-Zr, JDBM) was fabricated using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Strontium-doped octacalcium phosphate (SrOCP) and strontium hydrogen phosphate biphasic composite coatings were applied to the surface of the scaffolds. The results showed that the TPMS structure exhibited porous biomimetic characteristics that resemble cancellous bone, promoting vascular ingrowth and new bone formation. Additionally, the SrOCP coating significantly increased the surface roughness and hydrophilicity of the scaffold, which enhanced cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. The SrOCP coating also markedly reduced the degradation rate of the JDBM scaffolds while ensuring the sustained release of bioactive ions (Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺, Sr²⁺, and Ca²⁺), thus maintaining the scaffolds' biofunctional activity. Compared to JDBM scaffolds, JDBM/SrOCP scaffolds exhibited better biocompatibility and stronger vascularization and bone regeneration capabilities both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this study presents a novel strategy for the repair of bone defects using magnesium-based biomaterials, providing new insights for future clinical applications.",

Dark chocolate is an excellent source of Mg2+. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 70% cocoa chocolate intake on Mg2+ serum levels in patients with CKD on hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: These are secondary analyses from a previous controlled pilot study. The study included 59 patients undergoing HD. Patients were allocated into 2 groups: dark chocolate and the control group. The dark chocolate group received 40 g of 70% cocoa chocolate for 2 months during HD sessions (3 times a week). The control group did not receive any intervention. Mg2+ was evaluated by a colorimetric test using a commercial kit (Bioclin®). NCT04600258 on March 1, 2020, retrospectively registered. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients in the dark chocolate group (17 women, 53.4 ± 12.9 years) and 11 in the control group (4 women, 46.7 ± 10.9 years) completed the study. The median (interquartile range) overall Mg2+ serum levels were 2.4 (0.4) mg/dL, with no significant differences between the groups. After 2 months of supplementation, serum levels of Mg2+ increased significantly in the dark chocolate group from 2.5 (2.4-2.6) to 2.7 (2.6-2.8) mg/dL (P < .01). No change was observed in potassium and phosphorus plasma levels. CONCLUSIONS: Dark chocolate might be a promising nutritional strategy to improve Mg2+ levels in patients with CKD on HD. The offered dose was safe, not altering plasma phosphorus and potassium levels."

      "abstract": "It is essential to design multifunctional biomaterials for pro-osteogenesis, rooting out residual tumor cells and resisting infection after surgical resection of bone tumors. Herein, niobium oxide with oxygen vacancy (NbOv) was synthesized through a deoxidation reaction, which exhibited photothermal property because of strong light absorption in near-infrared (NIR) region. Subsequently, magnesium‑phosphorus gel composite (MP) containing NbOv (MPNOv) was fabricated, which also possessed photothermal property that effectively ablated tumor cells and eradicated bacteria under NIR irradiation in vitro. The in vitro experiments confirmed that compared with MP, MPNOv significantly boosted bone mesenchymal stem cells responses (e.g., propagation and osteoblastic differentiation) due to the presence of NbOv with bioactivity. The in vivo experiments demonstrate that MPNOv fostered bone generation and prevented tumor recurrence as well as infection. In short, MPNOv with good biocompatibility and photothermal property as well as pro-osteogenesis served as a multiple functional biomaterial conquered the tri-challenges: bone defect, tumor recurrence, and bacterial infection in bone tumor therapy. Accordingly, as a novel photothermal therapeutic platform, MPNOv with tumor cells/bacteria-eradicating and pro-osteogenesis ability would be applicable for treatment of bone tumors.",

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 206 patients, with a mean age of 68.3 ± 13.1 years; 121 (59%) were male, and the median follow-up time was 58 months. RESULTS: Thirty-seven episodes of fragility fractures were identified with a median HD vintage of 42 months-an incidence rate of 29 per 1000 person-years. Patients with fractures showed lower Mg levels compared with those without fractures (P < .001) and more VC (P = .01). In a Cox regression analysis, time to fragility fracture was independently associated with serum Mg <2.2 mg/dL (P < .001), in a model adjusted to age, female gender, HD vintage, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, albumin, parathyroid hormone, active vitamin D therapy and the presence of VC. Patients with Mg serum levels <2.2 mg/dL had a 1.32-fold higher risk of fragility fractures (P < .001).

      "abstract": "Background: Acne is a pathology of the pilosebaceous unit. It is characterized by a highly complex etiopathology which includes inflammation, hyperkeratinization, increased sebum production, colonization of Cutibacterium acne, hyperandrogenemia, and hyperinsulinemia. This condition, together with hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, and acanthosis nigricans, are highly prevalent cutaneous manifestations of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). While conventional therapies represent effective treatment options, they are not free from side effects which may reduce compliance. In this context, considerable attention has been directed toward nutraceutical supplements, which include different molecules with great potential to reduce inflammation, hyperkeratinization, hyperseborrhea, and hyperinsulinemia. Myo-inositol has been shown to be effective in improving some of the signs and symptoms of patients with microcystic ovaries: reducing body mass index (BMI), testosterone free levels, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels, and improving ovarian function and insulin sensitivity. Methods: The authors conducted a retrospective study that included 200 patients suffering from PCOS. Over 6 months, they analyzed the effects of the supplementation of LEVIGON™ (Sanitpharma; Milan, Italy)-a specific nutraceutical formulation containing myo-inositol, microlipodispersed magnesium, and folic acid-on the clinical picture of acne and hirsutism. Results: The supplementation of LEVIGON™ showed a significant reduction of BMI, testosterone, testosterone free, and DHEAS levels, thus improving the clinical picture of acne and hirsutism. Moreover, the impact of acne on the quality of life, assessed using the Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scale, improved significantly after 3 and 6 months. Women with hirsutism benefited also from a significant improvement of the Ferriman-Gallwey score after both 3 and 6 months (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001 respectively compared to the baseline). Conclusions: Myo-inositol supplementation, associated with microlipodispersed magnesium in a bioaccessible form, proved to be extremely useful in reducing acne and hirsutism in patients suffering from microcystic ovaries. In addition, there were no side effects, thus confirming excellent compliance. Further long-term randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm this preliminary evidence."

Migraine is among the ten neurological conditions accounting for the greatest disability in the whole population, the leading cause of disability for children and adolescents aged 5-19 years, and the second cause of disability for adults aged 20-59 years. Magnesium deficiency is also a very common condition resulting from diverse reasons, including insufficient dietary consumption or increased loss through the gastrointestinal or renal system. Accumulated evidence from case reports, case-control studies, observational studies, and randomized, placebo-controlled trials has shown the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation in alleviating migraine, both acutely and chronically. Mechanisms that may help explain these results include the potential link between magnesium deficit and spreading cortical depression, vascular changes, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, nervous excitation, neurotransmitter release, and electrolyte imbalances. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the available evidence on the links between magnesium and migraine, considering the role of magnesium in the pathogenesis of migraine and the utility of magnesium in its prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporotic fractures represent a significant public health challenge in the context of an aging global population, with the rising prevalence of osteoporosis intensifying the demand for effective fracture treatment. Restoring the structure and function of bone tissue damaged by osteoporosis-induced defects remains a critical issue in clinical practice. In recent years, bioactive metallic materials such as magnesium, zinc, and strontium have gained considerable attention due to their exceptional mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, positioning them as promising materials for osteoporotic fracture repair. This review systematically explored the biological mechanisms, application advancements, and associated challenges of magnesium, zinc, and strontium in fracture healing. Key topics included their roles in promoting osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, inhibiting osteoclast activity, and modulating the bone microenvironment. Additionally, this review examined the optimization strategies for their clinical application, such as their integration into bone scaffolds, the functionalization of conventional materials, and the synergistic effects between different metals. Finally, this review analyzed the current progress and unresolved issues in this field, offering a forward-looking perspective on the clinical potential of bioactive metallic materials in precision treatment of osteoporotic fractures."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sand enteropathy describes the clinical signs attributed to accumulation of sand in the gastrointestinal tract. Psyllium combined with magnesium sulphate has been recommended for clearing intestinal sand, but this has only been evaluated in one population. The combination of these two agents with paraffin oil has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of paraffin oil, psyllium and magnesium sulphate combined in clearing intestinal sand in horses diagnosed with sand enteropathy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Medical records of horses presenting for sand enteropathy that underwent treatment with psyllium, paraffin oil and magnesium sulphate were reviewed. Area of sand was calculated from abdominal radiographs. Treatment was deemed a success if more than 75% of the sand area was cleared. RESULTS: There were 52 horses and 2 donkeys included in the study. Daily treatment with psyllium at 1 g/kg, 6-8 mL/kg of paraffin oil, and magnesium sulphate at 1 g/kg by nasogastric intubation, was successful in clearing intestinal sand accumulation in 81% of equids over a median of 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days). Success rate was lower in Miniatures Ponies (44%). Complications were common (30%) but were generally mild or self-limiting. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of study design. Limited to cases that consented to sand clearance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of psyllium, magnesium sulphate and paraffin oil was effective at clearing intestinal sand in most cases. Miniature Ponies had a poorer response to treatment compared with other breeds and may be at increased risk of treatment failure.",

This study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of nifedipine and magnesium sulfate in the treatment of PTB. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, WanFang, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane were searched from inception to 1 December 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that compare the efficacy and safety of magnesium sulfate versus nifedipine in treating PTB. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two researchers independently screened studies and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool for RCTs and the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomised studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager V.5.4. RESULTS: In all, 50 articles were included in this review, comprising 6072 cases (n=3014 for the magnesium sulfate group; n=3058 for the nifedipine group). Compared with the magnesium sulfate group, the nifedipine group was more favourable in terms of time to onset of action and prolongation of days of gestation, as well as higher neonatal 1 min Apgar scores. The use of magnesium sulfate was associated with a higher incidence of maternal side effects, specifically tachycardia, flushing, palpitations, dizziness and nausea. In addition, the magnesium sulfate group also showed a higher incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome than the nifedipine group. CONCLUSION: Compared with magnesium sulfate, nifedipine is more effective with a faster onset of action and a longer prolonging pregnancy. Additionally, nifedipine may be safer for fewer maternal side effects and better neonatal outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of these treatments.",

      "abstract": "Shortage of phosphorus resource has become a global concern. Due to the high phosphorus content in sewage sludge, phosphorus recovery can be realized from thermal products of sewage sludge. Phosphorus recovery performance of smoldering ash (SA), incineration ash (IA) and pyrolysis char (PC) was investigated. The precipitate rate of phosphorus in acid and alkali leaching solutions is over 94 % by magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) methods. For MAP method, the recovered P contents in the precipitations of SA, IA and PC are 23.25 ± 0.35, 31.71 ± 0.79 and 23.76 ± 0.24 mg/g, respectively. For HAP recovery, the phosphorus contents per unit mass of precipitated products are lower than that by MAP, ranging from 13.67 ± 0.10 to 22.89 ± 0.34 mg/g. The purity of the recovered products was evaluated based on the contents of major elements and heavy metals in recovered products. Most of major elements and heavy metals can coprecipitate with phosphorus in the recovery products by acid leaching-MAP method. Due to the low impurity content in the alkali leaching solution and insolubility of most heavy metals in it, the products recovered by alkali leaching-HAP shows higher purity than that by acid leaching-MAP method. The phosphorus recovery performance, reagent consumption and purity of recovered products of the two methods were compared. Acid leaching-MAP recovery is optimal for IA due to its highest P recovery and purity, with lower reagent consumption compared to alkali leaching-HAP. For SA and PC, alkali leaching-HAP recovery is preferable due to its higher P recovery purity and market price of hydroxyapatite products.",

      "abstract": "Magnesium is one of the bioelements necessary for proper human functioning. It is classified as a macronutrient. Together with calcium and phosphorus, it is the main building component of teeth. It has antibacterial properties, as consequence of which it can impede the formation of biofilm and thus reduce inflammation caused by bacterial toxins. Along with calcium, phosphorus and vitamins, magnesium helps maintain the health of the human body. The scientific literature contains an increasing number of studies describing new methods for preventing caries resulting from interference with the oral microbiome. Modification of the microbiome and the use of prebiotics may prove to be groundbreaking. Magnesium may have the potential to function as a prebiotic because it promotes the colonization of commensal streptococci in the oral cavity. By changing the oral microbiome, it could play an important role in dental caries prevention. Nanotechnology is a new concept of material production that has emerged both in dentistry and other fields. In view of the resistance of certain bacteria to antibiotics and other bactericidal agents, alternative dental materials with increased antibacterial properties are being sought by adding antibacterial nanoparticles (NP) to their composition. One of the most commonly used metal oxides is magnesium oxide. Its antibacterial action involves disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. It seems that nanoparticles may be promising fillers for dental composites. However, due to the limited character of the clinical trials to date, there is a need for further experiments.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation and cartilage degeneration are critical challenges in osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Achieving sustained drug efficacy while mitigating the adverse effects of inflammation and reactive oxygen species remains a significant challenge. This study synthesizes a gallic acid-magnesium (GA-Mg) metal-organic framework (MOF) as a drug carrier for puerarin (PA). The PA-loaded GA-Mg MOF (pGM) is encapsulated within chondroitin sulfate methacrylate, forming monodisperse hybrid microspheres (CM@pGM) under ultraviolet light using microfluidic technology. The pGM is physically confined within the microspheres through a network of structural obstructions and noncovalent interactions. During degradation, GA and Mg2+ ions release from pGM, improving the inflammatory microenvironment of the articular cavity and mitigating oxidative stress. The sustained release of Mg2+ and PA supports chondrocyte anabolism and facilitates cartilage repair. In vitro studies confirm that injectable microspheres extend the drug release period to over 2 weeks. In vivo experiments demonstrate that CM@pGM significantly reduces osteophyte formation, alleviates degenerative changes in articular cartilage, and delays OA progression. In conclusion, CM@pGM, as a drug delivery platform that ameliorates the inflammatory microenvironment, alleviates oxidative stress, and promotes cartilage repair, holds significant potential for OA treatment.",

DESIGN: This double-blind clinical trial (code IRCT20230719058846N1) was conducted on the patients undergoing elective surgery in the city of Karaj. METHODS: A total of 100 patients, aged 18 to 40 years and classified as ASA I or II, who were candidates for elective surgery, were randomly assigned to two equal groups. Prior to intubation, patients received lidocaine spray (5 puffs of Lidocaine 10%) in one group, and magnesium sulfate spray (5 puffs of Magnesium 20%) in the other. Induction of anesthesia was the same in both groups. Patients' hemodynamic statuses were measured and compared once before the intubation and also 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 min after it. RESULTS: Before the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic and hemodynamic variables (P < 0.05). The results showed that the systolic blood pressure at minutes 3, 5, and 7 was significantly lower among the patients receiving magnesium than those receiving lidocaine (P < 0.05). Other hemodynamic variables were not statistically different between the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of the present study, magnesium sulfate spray is more effective than lidocaine in controlling hemodynamic complications. Therefore, it can be used to reduce hemodynamic complications following intubation. However, it may be associated with tachycardia, which needs to be taken into account.",

      "abstract": "Transport stress prior to slaughter frequently induces a stress response, negatively affecting meat quality. This study investigated the impact of dietary potassium magnesium sulphate (PMS) supplementation during the fattening stage on the stress response and meat quality in finishing pigs subjected to transport stress. The experiment involved two phases. Initially, 48 finishing pigs (68.00 ± 0.40 kg) were randomly allocated into two groups: a control group receiving a basal diet (CON) and a PMS-supplemented group receiving the basal diet with 0.50% PMS. Each group was housed in six pens, with four pigs per pen. After 60 days of feeding, in the second phase, two pigs from each pen were randomly selected for slaughter, with one pig subjected to a 4 h transportation stress prior to slaughter. Pigs were categorized into four treatment groups based on diet and stress: (1) control without transport stress, (2) control with transport stress, (3) PMS-supplemented without transport stress, and (4) PMS-supplemented with transport stress. Serum, jejunum, and longissimus thoracis muscle (LM) samples were collected. The results indicated that dietary PMS supplementation did not significantly affect growth performance during the fattening stage (p > 0.05). However, following transport, the PMS pigs showed a reduction in norepinephrine and cortisol concentrations (p = 0.09, p < 0.05) and a significant increase in serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PMS supplementation significantly increased serum catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p < 0.05), while significantly reducing cholesterol (CHO) levels (p < 0.05). Transport stress adversely affected the intestinal health of finishing pigs, as evidenced by a decrease in intestinal villus height (0.05 < p < 0.1), a condition ameliorated by PMS supplementation. Additionally, transported pigs exhibited a higher drip loss24h in LM (p < 0.05), which was also alleviated through PMS supplementation. In conclusion, PMS supplementation mitigates transport stress and improves meat quality in finishing pigs."

The study utilized adult male albino Swiss mice. Behavioral assessments were conducted using the forced swim test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). A locomotor activity test was conducted to exclude false positive results in the FST and TST. Moreover, the study assessed oxidative stress levels in the mice subjected to acute environmental stress by measuring glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, total oxidant status, and total antioxidant status. The administration of the IMI-Mg complex at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg resulted in a reduction in immobility time in both behavioral tests, thereby indicating the antidepressant-like potential of the tested complex, which was similar to the one observed after the administration of these two compounds as separate drug forms. The efficacy of the novel IMI-Mg complex represents a significant advancement and provides a foundation for future research. This innovative agent has the potential to enhance the safety profile of the therapy, streamline the treatment protocol, improve patient satisfaction, and promote adherence to the therapeutic regimen.",

      "abstract": "Given that the guided bone regeneration (GBR) membrane acts at the interface between the bone and connective tissue, the membrane imposes high demands on the organization of the material. Magnesium (Mg) alloys have emerged as promising candidates for GBR due to their biodegradability and favorable biocompatibility. However, challenges remain in the risk of soft tissue dehiscence and limited osteogenesis for Mg membranes in the clinical application. A dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4·2H2O, denoted as DCPD)/MgF2 Janus membrane was fabricated via chemical conversion and deposition, showcasing suitable degradability, surface-selective osteogenic property and soft tissue healing in vitro and vivo. The DCPD coating was designed to support osteogenesis, while the MgF2 coating was specifically engineered to facilitate soft tissue healing. Furthermore, the Janus membrane utilized its two-sided properties to show selectivity in adhesion, proliferation, and migration of the MC3T3-E1 and HGFs. In vivo results exhibited its capability to promote bone formation and optimal space maintenance ability. Notably, further RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that different functional cells may respond specifically to two coatings and exert functions. Taken together, these results provide an alternative method for designing surface-selective biomaterials, underlining effective potential applications in bone tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Traditional clinical treatment of bone defects with GBR membranes is frequently constrained to a single superimposed osteogenesis without structural-functional integration. Such a DCPD/MgF2 coated Janus membrane was fabricated by incorporating chemical deposition and transformation to satisfy optimal osteogenesis and soft tissue healing. Of particular interest, the Janus membrane allowed for chemotactic movement with specific cellular responses to stimuli from different coatings. In vivo, the membrane demonstrated promising effects and showcased space maintenance ability. The design concept exhibits a new avenue to regulate tissue regeneration between different tissue interface, presenting new horizons for the development of GBR membranes.",

      "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg)-based implants have become an attractive alternative to conventional permanent implants in the orthopedic field. While biocompatibility, degradation kinetics, and osseointegration of Mg-based implants have been mostly investigated, the impact of degradation products on bone remodeling and potential systemic effects remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early and mid-term local and systemic tissue responses of degrading ultrahigh-purity ZX00 (Mg-Zn-Ca alloy) and ultrahigh-purity Mg (XHP-Mg) pins in a juvenile healthy rat model. The potential differences between implant types (degradable vs. permanent), implantation, and age-related changes were investigated using titanium (Ti), sham-operated, and control groups (non-intervention), respectively. Degradation products of ZX00 and XHP-Mg pins promote osteogenesis in the medullary cavity by upregulating the expression levels of Bmp2 and Opg within 14 days post-surgery. The higher degradation rate of XHP-Mg resulted in the accumulation of degradation products starting from day 3 and upregulation of different genes, particularly Ccl2 and Cepbp. Besides good osseointegration and new bone tissue formation, we found a more parallel hydroxyapatite/collagen orientation along Mg-based pins in the perimeter region compared to Ti pins. In the liver, reduced glycogen levels in Mg-based pins indicated that degradation products promote glycogenolysis, while only the ZX00 group showed a higher serum glucagon level on day 14. Results suggest that degrading ZX00 and XHP-Mg pins stimulate osteogenesis mainly via Bmp2 and Opg and promote glycogenolysis in the liver, while the higher degradation rate of XHP-Mg pins resulted in upregulation of different genes and metabolites. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bioresorbable magnesium (Mg)-based implants are promising alternative candidates for orthopedic interventions. Until now, a few in vivo studies explored how Mg-based implants promote osteogenesis in the medullary cavity and modulate systemic tissue responses. Herein, results demonstrate i) the degradation rate of the Mg-based implants has a crucial effect on osteogenesis via regulating Bmp2 and Opg expression in the medullary cavity, ii) a parallel HAp/collagen matrix pattern in ZX00 and XHP-Mg groups compared to the Ti group, iii) both Mg pins promote glycogenolysis in the liver. Our findings highlight the dual role of Mg-based implants in bone remodeling and systemic metabolic modulation. Nevertheless, this is the first study to report the interaction between Mg-based implants and liver metabolism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urinary magnesium plays an important role in the prevention of calcium oxalate stone formation, but the role of magnesium supplementation has yet to be clearly defined. We examined the urinary biochemistry of patients taking magnesium supplementation with meals versus while fasting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-institution, prospective, randomized controlled pilot study examining magnesium supplementation taken with meals versus while fasting in patients with a history of calcium oxalate stones and isolated hyperoxaluria. Patients were provided a controlled diet and randomized to take magnesium supplementation either fasting or with meals during a 7-day study period. A pre-intervention and post-intervention 24-hour urinalysis was completed for all patients. RESULTS: Eight patients were enrolled with 4 patients randomized to each arm of magnesium supplementation. Those taking magnesium supplementation with meals experienced a median decrease of 17.8 mg/d in urinary oxalate, increase of 33.6 mg/d in urinary magnesium, and increase of 134.8 mg/d in urinary citrate from the pre- to the post-intervention 24-hour urinalysis. Those taking supplementation while fasting experienced an average decrease of 8.5 mg/d in urinary oxalate, increase of 21.8 mg/d in urinary magnesium, and increase of 116.6 mg/d of urinary citrate. CONCLUSION: Patients with a prior history of calcium oxalate stone formation and isolated hyperoxaluria who took magnesium supplementation with meals were found to have a more substantial improvement in urinary parameters on 24-hour urinalysis compared to those who took magnesium supplementation while fasting. Magnesium supplementation should be taken with meals if prescribed for the prevention of recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease characterized by degenerative changes in articular cartilage and chronic inflammation. Recent studies suggest that intra-articular (i.a.) injection of magnesium salts holds promise as a therapeutic approach for OA. However, the rapid diffusion of magnesium ions limits their efficacy, resulting in a short duration of action. To overcome this limitation, we developed a nanoparticle delivery system using MgO@SiO2 core/shell nanoparticles, designed as a depot for the controlled release of magnesium ions. Electron microscopy confirmed the formation of the core/shell structure with silica shells of varying thickness. Release studies demonstrated that the silica coating effectively slows nanoparticle degradation, extending magnesium release to over 72 hours. In a rabbit OA model, i.a. injection of these nanocapsules significantly mitigated the pathological progression of OA within four weeks without inducing systemic toxicity. Immunohistochemical analysis further revealed that MgO@SiO2 nanocapsules alleviate the inflammatory response in OA cartilage by inhibiting the NF-κB/p65 signaling pathway. In summary, this study confirms the potential of intra-articular magnesium supplementation as a therapeutic option for OA and introduces a novel approach to enhance the delivery and efficacy of magnesium ions in OA treatment, addressing a relatively underexplored area in the field."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some evidence suggests magnesium might reduce serum levels of lipid profile. Due to the significance of this matter on hand, we centralized our aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to interrogate the effect of magnesium supplementation on serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the general population aged ≥ 18 years. METHODS: In line with conducting this study first, relevant articles were found through searching databases, including five databases: Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed until January 2024. Following fulfilling the first aim, their mean differences and standard deviations were calculated to conduct the meta-analysis. Ultimately, an assessment of the statistical heterogeneity of intervention effects was performed using I-squared statistics and Cochran's Q test. RESULTS: Regarding serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C, twenty-one, twenty-three, twenty, and twenty-five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates showed no significant differences in serum levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C between the magnesium group and comparison group (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.34 mg/dl, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.75 to 2.43, P = 0.749, I2 = 99.1%; WMD=-2.06 mg/dl, 95% CI: -6.35 to 2.23, P = 0.346, I2 = 99.1; WMD = 1.71 mg/dl, 95% CI: -0.81 to 4.24, P = 0.183, I2 = 99.4, respectively). However, magnesium significantly increased HDL-C (WMD = 1.21 mg/dl, 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.85, P < 0.001, I2 = 99.5). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study showed that magnesium significantly increased HDL-C levels. However, due to high heterogeneity, we must note that more research is needed to make robust recommendations regarding magnesium supplementation in clinical practice.

The synthesis involved integrating MgFe2O4 nanoparticles with modified chitosan through a Schiff base formed by the reaction between terephthalaldehyde and aminopyrazine. A comprehensive characterization was performed, including X-ray diffraction analysis, which verified the crystalline structure and the successful incorporation of MgFe2O nanoparticles into the chitosan-Schiff base matrix. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a distinct surface morphology, characterized by a rough, non-uniform alignment resulting from the strong interactions between the nanoparticles and the Schiff base-chitosan matrix. Additionally, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis verified the elemental composition of the nanocomposite, revealing distinct peaks corresponding to carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, magnesium, and iron. The nanocomposite exhibited outstanding performance as a nanoadsorbent for the efficient removal of Pb(II) ions from aqueous media through electrostatic attraction and complexation mechanisms, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity of 290.7 mg g-1. The adsorption process was determined to be spontaneous, endothermic, and chemically driven, aligning well with the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetics. The optimal conditions for maximum Pb(II) ions removal were determined to be a pH of 5.5, a contact time of 100 min, and a temperature of 328 K. Furthermore, the nanocomposite demonstrated excellent recyclability, retaining over 94.8% of its initial removal efficiency after five consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. This study highlights the nanocomposite's potential as an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and highly efficient material for practical applications in water treatment, addressing the urgent need for sustainable solutions to heavy metal contamination."

Although nimodipine is widely used in the management of SAH, the potential benefits of magnesium as adjunct therapy remain unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining magnesium with nimodipine for the management of SAH. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies comparing magnesium plus nimodipine versus nimodipine alone in patients with SAH were included. Key outcomes included cerebral vasospasm (CV), delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), functional outcomes, mortality, and adverse events. RESULTS: Twelve studies involving 2,338 patients were included. The combination of magnesium and nimodipine significantly reduced the incidence of CV (odds ratio [OR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.95; p=0.03) and DCI (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.87; p=0.01) compared to nimodipine alone. However, no significant differences were found in functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale: OR, 0.97; p=0.75; Glasgow Outcome Scale: OR, 0.81; p=0.24), mortality (OR, 0.97; p=0.83), or secondary cerebral infarction (OR, 0.38; p=0.12). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the combination group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (OR, 3.14; p=0.33). CONCLUSION: Adding magnesium to nimodipine therapy in patients with SAH may help reduce CV and DCI incidence but does not significantly improve functional outcomes or mortality. Further large-scale studies are needed to optimize the dosing regimens and confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "A large amount of water-soluble waste salts is produced from traditional electrolytic manganese metal industry (EMMWS), and landfill treatment of the EMMWS increases the risk of pollution of the surrounding water and soil. The EMMWS mainly comprises sulphates with highly active components that can be recycled as secondary resources. Herein, a simple and efficient process comprising four-stage precipitation and separation, two-stage crystallisation, molten salt treatment, and water-leaching is proposed for comprehensive treatment of the EMMWS, as well as the recovery of manganese, magnesium, and ammonium, systematically investing the feasibility of this strategy. The results indicate that 95.3% Mn in the saturated EMMWS solution containing NH3 can be selectively oxidised to Mn oxides by O2(g), and the residual Mn can be thoroughly removed to 0.31 mg/L with (NH4)2S2O8 oxidation. 92.78% Mg in the solution after Mn removal can be precipitated as 4MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·4H2O with NH4HCO3 and NH3·H2O, and the 98.81% of residual Mg can be removed as struvite with concentrated H3PO4. (NH4)2SO4 product can be obtained by crystallisation after Mn and Mg separation. 97.49% Mn in the Mn oxides can be converted into MnSO4 via (NH4)2SO4 molten salt treatment, and a light pink MnSO4·H2O product is obtained with water-leaching and crystallisation operations. Following the proposed process, the Mg, Mn, and NH4+/NH3 in EMMWS are recycled as 4MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·4H2O, struvite, MnSO4·H2O, and (NH4)2SO4 products. All the products obtained meet the relevant national standards. Economic analysis shows that a profit of US$282.45 might be achieved for each ton of EMMWS treated. This process is of great significance for the effective treatment of EMMWS and the recovery of manganese, magnesium, and ammonium resources.",

This ambiguity raises questions about the potential benefits of Mg supplementation in individuals with DN. Therefore, this comprehensive review summarizes and discusses the evidence from clinical, in vitro, and in vivo studies on the association between Mg and DN. Several findings indicate that Mg depletion is linked to the presence of neuropathy in diabetic patients. Additionally, low Mg concentration may contribute to the onset or worsening of DN by promoting axonal degeneration through various pathways. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that Mg supplementation can have neuroprotective effects.

We studied the microstructure of aluminum Al-1051/AZ31 magnesium laminates fabricated by the roll-bonding process. The fabricated laminates were investigated in the as-fabricated condition and after subsequent stress relief annealing treatment at temperatures ranging from 200 °C to 400 °C. The investigation aims to determine the optimal temperature to decrease the residual stress of the severely deformed microstructure of the roll-bonded Al/Mg laminates. Internal residual stress can limit the application of such laminates. Such a thermal treatment enhances the interdiffusion of Al and Mg at the Al/Mg interface resulting in the formation of intermetallic phases. Intermetallic compounds are undesirable due to their brittleness and impact on the overall laminate structure and integrity. Detailed microstructure characterization of the intermetallic compounds and internal residual stress by means of recrystallization degree revealed that stress-relief treatment at 200 °C/1 h is sufficient to reduce internal residual stress and ensure adequate interdiffusion at Al/Mg interface to minimize the formation of brittle intermetallic compounds in the diffusion zone."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis is a widespread and debilitating condition, particularly affecting the medial compartment of knee joint due to varus knee deformities. Medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO) has emerged as an effective treatment, but it comes with challenges like fractures, correction loss, and nonunion, leading to unsatisfactory results in up to 26 % of patients. In response, our study explores the potential of a bioabsorbable magnesium-based bulk metallic glass composite (Mg67Zn28Ca5 BMGC) enriched with molybdenum particles as an innovative solution for MOWHTO. METHODS: Our comprehensive study includes composite fabrication, mechanical property evaluations, in vitro degradation tests, cell viability assessments, cell migration assays, calcium deposition analyses, and osteoblast differentiation investigations. In vivo experiments were commenced for assessing biological effects and bone growth of the Mg67Zn28Ca5 BMGC in an animal model. Finite element analysis was utilized for assessing the mechanical impact of the composite wedge in human MOWHTO. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the Mg67Zn28Ca5 BMGC closely matches human cortical bone's mechanical properties, with controlled degradation and superior cellular responses. In vivo experiments reveal progressive degradation and bone integration. Finite element analysis confirms the composite's mechanical effectiveness in MOWHTO. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our research introduces an innovative Mg67Zn28Ca5 BMGC enriched with molybdenum particles, showing promising mechanical and degradation characteristics. It has the potential to improve MOWHTO surgeries by matching cortical bone properties, controlled degradation, and promoting beneficial ion release for bone health. Successful tissue integration suggests suitability for high tibial osteotomy surgeries, offering hope for better outcomes in knee osteoarthritis patients. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: This article focuses on meeting the advantages of a novel magnesium-based BMGC with the clinical unmet need of MOWHTO surgeries. If properly developed, the results of this article have significant potential of translation to other temporary orthopedic implants under load-bearing conditions."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has been associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may contribute to higher risks of mortality could facilitate targeted and intensive intervention strategies in this population. This study aims to examine whether the magnesium depletion score (MDS) is associated with all-cause and CVD mortality among individuals with MASLD or metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease (MetALD). METHODS: A total of 3802 participants with MASLD or MetALD were followed up over a median of 26 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III cohort. The MDS was calculated by aggregating four factors influencing the reabsorption capability of the kidneys. The associations between MDS and all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality were quantified using Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: In the combined MASLD + MetALD cohort, a higher MDS (>2) was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR, 2.52; 95%CI, 1.77-3.61; p-trend < 0.0001) and CVD mortality (HR, 3.01; 1.87-4.86; p-trend < 0.0001) compared to MDS = 0; this association became stronger among participants who did not meet the estimated average requirement level of Mg intake (2.72; 1.69-4.37; p-trend = 0.0014) and those with a Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) < 1.3 (2.95; 1.69-5.15; p-trend = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with MASLD or MetALD, higher MDS, indicative of worse global Mg status, was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Correcting global Mg deficiency in high-risk MASLD/MetALD patients may have long-term health benefits.",

      "abstract": "Sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) was filled into the micropores and onto the surface of a magnesium alloy microarc oxidation (MAO) coating by means of vacuum impregnation. Subsequently, the coating was sealed through silane treatment to synergistically boost its corrosion resistance. The phase composition of the coating was inspected using XRD. FTIR was utilized to analyze the functional groups in the coating. XPS was employed to study the chemical composition and valence state of the coating. The surface and cross-sectional morphology of the coating, along with its elemental composition and distribution, were investigated by SEM and EDS. Meanwhile, the thickness of the coating was analyzed using Image J software. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to determine the corrosion resistance of the coating. The results show that compared with an MAO coating, M-0.125W composite coating (only filled with sodium tungstate on the surface of the MAO coating), and M-SG composite coating (only receiving silanization treatment applied to the surface of the MAO coating), the corrosion resistance of the M-nW-SG composite coating (loaded with sodium tungstate on the surface of the MAO coating and then treated with silane) is significantly improved. This is mainly attributed to the fact that sodium tungstate can be combined with Mg2+ to form insoluble magnesium tungstate protective film, which blocks corrosion media. At the same time, silanization treatment further seals the MAO coating and increases the compactness of the coating. In addition, with the increase in the impregnation concentration of sodium tungstate, the content of sodium tungstate in the M-nW-SG composite coating improves, and the sealing effect of silanization treatment is better. When the impregnation concentration of sodium tungstate is 0.1 mol/L or above, the MAO coating with sodium tungstate can be completely sealed. When the impregnation concentration of sodium tungstate is 0.125 mol/L, M-0.125W-SG composite coating has the best corrosion resistance, and its impedance modulus value can be maintained at 8.06 × 106 Ω·cm2 after soaking in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution for 144 h, which is about three orders of magnitude higher than those of MAO coating and M-0.125W and M-SG composite coatings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Understanding how enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) differentiate into neurons is crucial for neurogenesis therapy and gastrointestinal disease research. This study explores how magnesium ions regulate the glycolytic pathway to enhance ENCCs differentiation into neurons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used polymerase chain reaction, western blot, immunofluorescence, and multielectrode array techniques to assess magnesium ions' impact on ENCCs differentiation. Non-targeted metabolomic sequencing, cellular acidification rate, oxygen consumption, and western blot analyzed sugar metabolism changes. D-glucose-13C6 isotope tracing identified key glucose flux changes. Surface plasmon resonance was used to detect the binding affinity of magnesium ions with key glycolysis genes. The elastic modulus of the hydrogel was measured using a universal testing machine, while pore size and porosity were assessed with scanning electron microscopy. Swelling ratios were determined using gravimetric analysis. In vivo, ENCCs in hydrogels were transplanted into renal capsule and subcutaneously, and magnesium ions' effects on ENCCs differentiation were evaluated. RESULTS: Magnesium ions increased glycolysis levels during ENCCs differentiation into neurons, along with significant upregulation of neuronal markers β-Tubulin and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1, and enhanced functional neuronal properties. D-glucose-13C6 tracing results showed increased carbon flux in the glycolytic pathway after magnesium supplementation. The binding affinity of magnesium ions with the glycolytic key enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 was found to be 1.08 μM. Inhibiting glycolysis suppressed ENCCs differentiation into neurons, emphasizing its crucial role. The double-cross-linked hydrogel gelatin methacryloyl-alginate (gelMA-ALMA), cross-linked with magnesium ions, showed promise in enhancing ENCCs differentiation in vivo without causing systemic hypermagnesemia. CONCLUSION: Magnesium ions promote ENCCs differentiation into neurons by activating the Warburg effect. The GelMA-ALMA hydrogel serves as an effective localized magnesium delivery system, supporting neuronal differentiation in vivo.",

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral supplementation with magnesium chloride plus vitamin D in alleviating depressive symptoms related to long-COVID. A total of 60 subjects, aged 52.8±12.6 years, with a diagnosis of hypomagnesemia, vitamin D deficiency, and mild-to-moderate depression (MMD) related to long-COVID, were enrolled in an open-label randomized, controlled clinical trial. Participants were randomly allocated into an intervention group (n=30) that received magnesium chloride (1300 mg) plus vitamin D (4000 IU), or a control group (n=30) that received vitamin D (4000 IU), for four months. Using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), diagnosis of MMD was established based on a score of ≥11<30. The primary trial endpoint was improvement in depressive symptoms (BDI <11). Mild adverse events that did not require withdrawal from intervention were documented in six (20.0%) and three (10%) individuals of the intervention and control group, respectively. By comparing baseline vs. final measurements, the BDI score was significantly reduced in individuals in the intervention (28.8±3.7 to 9.2±7.5, p<0.01) and control (28.4±3.8 to 21.6±9.1, p<0.05) group. A total of 22 (73.2%) subjects in the intervention group and 10 (34.5%) in the control group reached a BDI <11, p=0.006.

Magnesium administered contemporarily with low-dose NMDA antagonists has been shown to cause a reduction in anxiety-related and depressive-like behaviours. This observational study investigated the possible association between magnesium levels and impulsivity, measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), during ketamine treatment. Forty-nine inpatients with treatment-resistant mood disorders were involved in the study.

METHOD: This single-center retrospective and observational clinical study involved patients aged over 70 years who presented to the emergency department for any complaint. Those whose Mg levels were not assessed and those who presented due to trauma, treated in another hospital before coming to our hospital, presented in cardiopulmonary arrest, refused treatment and/or left the hospital without permission, and were referred to another hospital were excluded from this study. The patients were classified as having hypomagnesemia (≤1.7 mg/dL Mg), normomagnesemia (1.7-2.2 mg/dL), and hypermagnesemia (≥2.2 mg/dL). We assessed whether patients between these groups could provide data on hospitalization, discharge, and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The average age of the included patients was 77.11 ± 7.91 years. Of the patients, 1032 (55.3 %) were female. The incidence rates of hypomagnesemia, normomagnesemia, and hypermagnesemia significantly differed between the hospitalized and discharged patients (p < 0.01). In older patients, hypermagnesemia was associated with hospitalization. Moreover, a significant difference in Mg levels at 28 days was observed between the deceased patients and survivors (p < 0.001); hypermagnesemia was significantly more common among the deceased patients. The results of the univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that hypermagnesemia was a significant factor for discharge at 28 days (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: While hypomagnesemia is more manageable than hypermagnesemia, the latter is an important predictor of hospitalization and 28-day mortality in individuals over 70 years old.",

This study represents the first investigation exploring the relationship between Mg²⁺ levels and CIN in this context.We conducted a retrospective study involving 2306 consecutive STEMI patients undergoing pPCI. Serum Mg²⁺ levels were measured on admission. Logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis were employed to assess the association between Mg²⁺ levels and CIN development. Of the enrolled patients, 691 (30%) developed CIN post-pPCI. Mg²⁺ levels were significantly lower in the CIN group (P < .001). Multivariate analysis identified Mg²⁺ <2.03 mg/dL, age >68 years, left ventricular Ejection Fraction (EF) <49%, and post-procedure Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade <2 as independent predictors of CIN. ROC analysis revealed an Mg²⁺ cutoff of 2.03 mg/dL, Area Under the Curve (AUC): 0.711, sensitivity: 69%, specificity: 68%).

Specifically, it examines how omeprazole influences the fractional excretion of Mg. METHODS: This single-arm clinical trial was conducted from 2020 to 2021. With 44 children diagnosed with acid peptic disease who received omeprazole (1-2 mg/kg/day) for 3 months at the Gastroenterology Clinic of Imam Hossein Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Serum and urine levels of Mg and creatinine were measured before and after the intervention using the Pars Azmoon Kit, following the kits guidelines. The fractional excretion of Mg was then calculated using standard formulas. FINDINGS: The mean urinary Mg levels decreased significantly from 4.96 ± 2.48 mg/dL before treatment to 1.46 ± 0.63 mg/dL after treatment (P < 0.001). Serum Mg levels also significantly declined from 1.90 ± 0.20 mg/dL before treatment to 1.37 ± 0.03 mg/dL after treatment (P < 0.01). The mean fractional excretion of Mg decreased from 5.2% ± 1.2% before therapy to 1.7% ± 0.63% after treatment (P < 0.01). Serum creatinine levels showed a slight increase from 0.62 ± 0.19 mg/dL to 0.67 ± 0.13 mg/dL (P = 0.053), whereas urinary creatinine levels increased by 20.80 ± 18.77 mg/dL (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The observed hypomagnesemia is not attributable to increased urinary Mg loss. Instead, the kidneys appear to compensate for the reduced serum Mg levels by decreasing urinary Mg excretion, thereby conserving Mg in the body following omeprazole treatment."

Although bone tissue engineering is a promising treatment for extensive osseous defects, orthopedic-implant-related infections increase the likelihood of failure. Bioactive glass (BG) has been widely used in the manufacture of artificial bone scaffolds, owing to its excellent biocompatibility and osteoinductivity. Nevertheless, considering that infection conditions and trauma can affect the osteogenic capacity of bioactive glass, this study combined BG with magnesium and strontium to promote osteogenesis and confer significant antimicrobial activity. Novel bioactive glass doped with magnesium-strontium (BGMSN) with good biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial properties, and promising osteogenic induction ability was constructed from 45S5, Mg, and Sr carbonates via a melt-quenching approach. The results of an in vitro cell biocompatibility study indicated that the BGMSN exhibited good cellular compatibility. Furthermore, osteogenic alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and osteopontin genes were upregulated upon BGMSN/MC3T3-E1 coculture. BGMSN exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus mutans. Animal experiments further demonstrated the exceptional bone-inducing ability of BGMSN. Accordingly, owing to their excellent antimicrobial properties, BGMSN can be used for bone regeneration, particularly under infected conditions."

Propensity score matching was conducted to ensure that patients receiving magnesium supplementation (including magnesium sulfate and magnesium oxide) were balanced with those not receiving it in terms of baseline characteristics. The primary analysis focused on the 28-day all-cause mortality rate, with secondary endpoints encompassing ICU and one-year mortality rates, along with the duration of hospitalization. After matching, the study's final cohort balanced at 1970 patients, with 985 patients per group. The results showed that magnesium intake significantly contributed to a decrease in the 28-day all-cause mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 0.682; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.539-0.863), particularly in subgroups such as older patients (HR, 0.65; 95% CI 0.52-0.81), females (HR, 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.73), and those with hypertension (HR, 0.62; 95% CI 0.48-0.79) or without diabetes (HR, 0.54; 95% CI 0.41-0.71). Although magnesium treatment improved both ICU and one-year mortality rates, it concurrently resulted in extended ICU and hospital stays. Mediation analysis indicated that blood urea nitrogen partially mediated the association between magnesium intake and mortality, accounting for approximately 22.73% of the observed effect. Magnesium supplementation has illustrated a significant potential for mitigating the mortality rate in the HFpEF patient, particularly among the elderly, female, and individuals with hypertension. Therefore, magnesium supplementation stands as a potentially valuable supplementary treatment modality for patients with HFpEF. Further comprehensive research is warranted to explore its effects more deeply.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidural steroid injections are frequently used to treat chronic radicular pain of a discogenic origin; however, their efficacy remains limited. Magnesium sulfate and dexmedetomidine are emerging adjuvants with the potential to enhance the effectiveness and prolong the therapeutic duration of steroid injections. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, 90 patients with unilateral lower limb radiculopathy due to lumbar disc prolapse who did not respond to conservative treatment for 12 weeks were assigned to three groups. The control group received dexamethasone (4 mg), lidocaine 2% (40 mg), and saline. The magnesium group received magnesium sulfate (200 mg) with dexamethasone and lidocaine. The dexmedetomidine group received dexmedetomidine (50 mcg), dexamethasone, lidocaine, and saline. Pain intensity was assessed using the visual analog scale at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included the Modified Oswestry Disability Index (MODI), analgesic consumption, and procedure-related complications. RESULTS: Both magnesium and dexmedetomidine significantly reduced pain, disability, and analgesic consumption for up to 3 months. By 6 months, the magnesium group demonstrated significant improvement in pain scores and MODI and a decline in ibuprofen use compared to the control and dexmedetomidine groups. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium significantly reduced pain intensity, disability, and analgesic consumption over a 6-month observation period."

      "abstract": "In this research, tartaric acid was used to enhance the hydroxyapatite coating on AZ31 Mg alloy substrate through post-treatment and direct addition methods, and the corrosion resistance and biological activity of the samples were investigated. The parameters of concentration, immersion time, and pH of the coating solution were optimized by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Direct Current (DC) Polarization techniques. According to EIS results in the post-treatment method, tartaric acid with a concentration of 1 g/L, pH = 9 and immersion time of 2 min, increased the corrosion resistance of hydroxyapatite coating from 3630 to about 18,763 Ω.cm2. In the direct addition method, this value increased to 26,577 Ω.cm2. The optimal sample obtained from this method has a concentration of 1 g/L of tartaric acid and an immersion time of 2 h. Further, the morphology, crystal structure, and chemical bonds on the surface were investigated via FE-SEM, XRD, and ATR-FTIR analysis, respectively. Moreover, samples were immersed in SBF solution and after 3 weeks of immersion, the post-treatment sample exhibited the highest bio-corrosion resistance and the least morphological changes compared to other samples. Also, using antibacterial tests, it was concluded that the post-treatment method provides a coating with better antibacterial properties than other coatings.",
