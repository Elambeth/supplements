Recently, thermal crises symptoms in hot springs have been associated with acute cyanopeptides poisoning. The aim of this work is to develop a fast, easy and reliable method to monitor the presence of toxic cyanopeptides in geothermal waters. The analytical method based on capillary zone electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (CZE-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of 14 cyanopeptides in less than 7.5 min. A basic 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer at pH 10.2 was selected as the background electrolyte, positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) was employed for all compounds, and a salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) protocol with acetonitrile as an extraction solvent and MgSO4 as an auxiliary salting-out agent was optimized as sample treatment. Six natural hot springs in the province of Granada (Andalucía, Spain) were sampled at the beginning of the summer season (June) and at the end (September). Biomass collected at two sample points (Santa Fe and Zújar) contained cyanobacteria cells from the genera Phormidium, Leptolyngbya, and Spirulina. Nevertheless, cyanotoxins covered by this work were not found in any of the water samples analyzed. The greenness and transferability of the method was evaluated highlighting its sustainability and applicability.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acne is a common skin disease with a high psychosocial burden, affecting mostly adolescents and youth worldwide. Management of acne is often challenged by cutaneous side effects that leads to therapeutic intolerance, poor compliance and impaired efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-centre, evaluatorblinded, split-face, randomised study investigating the effects of thermal spring water (TSW) in improving efficacy and tolerability of standard acne therapy. Total of 31 participants with mild-to-moderate acne were recruited and subjected to TSW spray to one side of the face 4 times daily for 6 weeks in addition to standard therapy. The other side received standard therapy only. RESULTS: Six (19.4%) males and 25 (80.6%) female with mean age 25.1±6.13 participated, 15 (48.4%) had mild acne while 16 (51.6%) had moderate acne. Seven (22.6%) were on oral antibiotics, 25 (80.6%) used adapalene, 6 (19.4%) tretinoin and 21 (67.7%) benzoyl peroxide. Skin hydration improved and better on spring water treated side with mean difference12.41±30.31, p = 0.04 at the forehead, 39.52±65.14, p < 0.01 at the cheek and 42.172±71.71, p < 0.01 at the jaw at week 6. Participants also report significant reduction in dryness at the treated side at week 6, mean difference 0.93±0.10, p < 0.001. TEWL, sebum and pH were comparable on both sides with no significant differences. Tolerability towards standard therapy improved as early week 2 with reduction of stinging following application of topical therapy (mean difference 0.62±1.43, p = 0.03), increase in skin feeling good (-1.79±1.70, p < 0.001) and skin suppleness (0.62±1.43, p < 0.001). These improvements were significantly maintained till week 6. Cardiff acne disability index significantly improved at week 6 (p<0.001) despite no significant changes in Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale score before and after treatment. CONCLUSION: TSW may have a role as an adjunct to standard acne therapy by improving hydration, acne disability index and tolerability towards standard topical treatment.",

AIM: The current review explores the influence of the skin microbiome on facial skin aging and the effects of oral and topical probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics use on skin aging and cosmetic outcomes. METHODS: Five dermatologists who treat clinical signs of facial skin aging and a microbiome scientist (advisors) explored the relationship between the skin microbiome and skin aging. Published evidence and the advisors' knowledge lead to guidance on the skin microbiome using oral and topical prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics to reduce signs of aging. RESULTS: The role of the microbiome in aging skin is an emerging concept. A diverse skin microbiome is essential for skin health. Preliminary studies suggest oral probiotics and prebiotics may play a role in reducing signs of skin aging, likely through shifting to a greater skin and gut microbiome diversity. Thermal spring water contains probiotics and prebiotics. Preliminary studies suggest topically applied probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics may improve signs of skin aging, including a reduction in fine lines and increased hydration. CONCLUSIONS: The panel agreed that oral and topical prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics may play a role in improving signs of aging by improving the skin microbiome. Larger studies with more prolonged treatment trials are needed to better understand the microbiome's role in skin aging and the possible benefits of prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics use.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated the efficacy of balneotherapy in atopic dermatitis (AD), including a pediatric open randomized clinical trial conducted at the Comano thermal spring water center, which showed a significant reduction in AD severity and an improvement of the quality of life. However, so far many studies on balneotherapy in pediatric AD have included relatively small populations without identifying patients' characteristics associated with their response. The aim of the present study was to identify any features associated with the clinical response to the Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy in a large cohort of pediatric AD patients. METHODS: An observational study was conducted on 867 children aged ≤16 years (females 50.5%, mean patient's age 5.9 years, standard deviation ±3.6 years) with mild to severe AD who underwent balneotherapy at the Comano thermal spring water center (Comano, Trentino, Italy) from April to October 2014. Patients were stratified according to their disease severity, which was evaluated using five SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) categories before and immediately after a thermal spring water balneotherapy course. Potential characteristics associated with the patients' clinical response to Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy were investigated. RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement in AD severity was observed after Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy (p < 0.0001). A significantly higher percentage of patients achieving improvement in AD severity was reported among children ≤4 years old (p < 0.0001) with early-onset AD (p < 0.0001), severe AD (p < 0.0001) or coexistent reported food allergies (p < 0.01). The therapy was well tolerated, and no relevant adverse effects were reported during the treatment course. CONCLUSIONS: Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy is a safe complementary treatment for pediatric patients with AD, as it was able to reduce the disease severity, especially in children ≤4 years old, with early onset AD, severe AD or concomitant food allergies.",

Arising from a dolomitic aquifer system, its physico-chemical properties are well-established and its bacteriological quality regularly monitored. The microbiota of this aquifer have been characterized. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the structure of the bacterial community inhabiting the deep aquifer and to examine its dynamics over time. METHODS: The Avène TSW was collected at the catchment point and filtered through 0.1 µm pore size filters. The sampling was carried out every 3 months to generate a 4-year time series. The DNA extracted from filters was analysed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the microorganisms and their contribution were characterized by the taxonomic assignment of sequence variants generated from each sample. RESULTS: Bacteria were distributed into 39 phyla. Nitrospirae and Proteobacteria were the most prevalent, accounting for 38% and 23% of the total community on average, respectively. A stable pattern was observed throughout the study. A few bacterial species were always detected, forming a core community of likely chemolithoautotrophic organisms which might use energy sources and nutrients produced from water-bedrock interactions. Most of the species were distantly related to organisms described to date. CONCLUSIONS: Avène TSW provided by the deep aquifer system harbours a unique microbial community, shaped by the physico-chemical characteristics of the deep environment. Its remarkable stability over time has revealed a high level of confinement of the water resource.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hydrotherapy appears as a valuable therapeutic tool in the management of patients suffering from chronic skin inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, the underlying immune mechanisms of these beneficial effects remain poorly understood. To better understand the biological effects of thermal spring water on the immune system, we investigated the effects of Avène thermal spring water (ASW) on dendritic cells as key cells participating in the control of the immune response. METHODS: Dendritic cells (DCs) were generated from human monocytes and matured with LPS in ASW-based culture medium or in dexamethasone supplemented culture medium as an anti-inflammatory treatment. The phenotypes and abilities of these DCs to produce cytokines and induce allogeneic T cell response was next assessed. RESULTS: We showed that ASW modulated the differentiation of monocytes into DCs and impacted the DC maturation upon LPS priming. We observed a reduction of the CD83, CD86, CD1a and HLA-DR molecule expression and a decrease of IL-12 and IL-23 production whereas IL-10 production was increased. LPS-primed DCs generated in presence of ASW exhibited a reduced capacity to induce naive CD4+ T cell proliferation and IFN-γ and IL-17 production. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that ASW is endowed with an immunomodulatory potential. ASW limits the DC stimulatory capacity of Th1 and Th17 cell responses by impairing their maturation, IL-12 and IL-23 production and accessory cell function."

      "abstract": "The oral administration of mineral-rich spring water is known as hydropinic treatment and is used to treat certain ailments. Health benefits are attributed to thermal spring water containing radioactive elements such as radium; this has popularized use of such radioactive water in various parts of the world, causing those who ingest it to increase their internal radiation dose. The goal of this study was to assess the activity concentrations of Ra present in the thermal spring waters of San Diego de Alcala, in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, and to estimate the health risk posed to patients by the effective dose received from ingesting this water during hydropinic treatments. Water samples were taken from different areas of the San Diego de Alcala thermal springs, and pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, and total dissolved solids were measured. The Ra activity concentrations were measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The activity concentrations of Ra in sampled water varied from 125 to 452 mBq L with an average of 276 ± 40 mBq L. The committed effective dose from each of the Ra activity concentrations found in samples ranged from 9.80 × 10 to 4.0 × 10 mSv for hydropinic treatments being carried out in San Diego de Alcala thermal spring spas. Different treatments had different intake rates (200, 600, 1,000, and 1,500 mL d) and occurred over periods of 2 or 3 wk. According to the guidelines of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the maximum permissible amount of radium in drinking water is 185 mBq L; the Ra content in most of the collected samples exceeded this limit. The committed effective doses varied with Ra concentration and intake rate; none exceeded the World Health Organization's reference dose for drinking water of 0.1 mSv y, which is the maximum amount to which the population should be exposed.",

METHODS: A review was undertaken to explore the role of LRP-TSW as a topical probiotic and prebiotic therapy in improving the diversity of the skin microbiota and reducing dryness and pruritus in inflammatory skin diseases. RESULTS: The concentration of minerals and non-pathogenic microbes in LRP-TSW may explain its therapeutic benefit when used for inflammatory skin diseases. Clinical studies have shown that topical LRP-TSW treatment results in increases in Gram-negative bacteria with reduction of Gram-positive bacteria, and improvements in skin microbial diversity. At the same time skin condition in atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and general dryness in otherwise healthy skin, has been shown to improve. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancement of skin microbiota diversity using topical LRP-TSW may offer a valuable option for the treatment and maintenance of inflammatory skin diseases.

METHODS: Colitis was induced by 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in the drinking water of C57BL/6 mice for 7 days. Some animal groups drank Harkány thermal spring water or water supplemented with 21.68 mg/L NaHS. General signs of colitis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme activity of colon samples, histological features of colitis and function of the enteric nervous system were assessed. RESULTS: Oral administration of Harkány thermal spring water significantly attenuated general signs of colitis, MPO enzyme activity of colon samples and detrimental effect of colitis on the function of the enteric nervous system, but not histological signs of colitis. These findings could be reproduced using NaHS solution with additional significantly diminished histological damage. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that oral treatment with Harkány thermal spring water relieves various aspects of DSS-evoked colitis in mice. This effect is most likely to be mediated by hydrogen sulfide content of the Harkány water. Our data might promote complementary utilization of sulfurous thermal spring water in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.",

METHODS: Several studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy of this product in the management of rosacea prone skin, as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy or to maintain the efficacy of a Metronidazole treatment. The first study was performed on 37 women aged 18-45 with added stage 2 erythro-couperosis, who applied test formula as monotherapy twice a day for 4 weeks. During a second study, a dermatological evaluation was performed on patients with stage I or II rosacea, a questionnaire containing information about patient characteristics, tolerance, clinical signs, symptoms and skin reactivity to \"trigger factors\" was completed by dermatologists at baseline and 2 months after treatment with the test formula as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Finally, in a third study, 65 patients finishing a Metronidazole treatment applied once daily and the tested formula twice daily were divided into 2 groups using the test formula or vehicle control, twice a day for 8 weeks for the evaluation of efficacy as adjunctive therapy. RESULTS: We noted that the test formula, as an adjunctive therapy, helped prolong the efficacy of a Metronidazole treatment. In monotherapy, there was a significant efficacy of the test formula associated with an excellent tolerance. A significant improvement of all the clinical signs and symptoms of rosacea and a reduction of the skin reactivity to \"trigger factors\" were shown. CONCLUSIONS: These studies highlight the interest value and impact of a skincare product containing Ambophenol, Neurosensine, and La Roche-Posay thermal spring water formulated in a highly protective packaging in monotherapy or in combination with or after a therapeutic treatment in the management of patients suffering from rosacea.",

In vitro experiments have demonstrated the effect of Avène TSW on membrane fluidity, its antiradical and anti-inflammatory properties, its effects on many mediators involved in the immune response and its stimulating effect on keratinocyte differentiation. The clinical efficacy of the water was demonstrated at the hydrotherapy centre in chronic and disabling diseases such as atopic dermatitis but also in various settings in medical and post dermatology procedure such as photodynamic therapy or photothermolysis. All these data support the fact that the Avène TSW is an active component.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Melasma is a common dermatological skin disease that can now be treated by fractional photothermolysis (fractional resurfacing). Past studies have shown that thermal spring water (TSW) spray can reduce local inflammatory symptoms after dermatological surgery, laser surgery or chemical peelings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of spraying TSW post-fractional resurfacing treatment in patients with dermal melasma. METHODS: Twenty patients with bilateral dermal melasma were included in this split-face comparative study. Patients were treated by fractional resurfacing laser and then TSW was sprayed generously unilaterally. For the next 48 h, patients were instructed to spray thermal water at least six times a day on one side. Patient's self-assessment conducted 10 min and 2 days after TSW spraying (stinging, pain, skin dryness, swelling, and redness) and investigator's 48-h post-treatment evaluation (purpura, skin dryness, erythema, swelling, scars, hyper- or hypopigmentation) were recorded for the treated and control sides using visual analogue scales. RESULTS: Pain, dryness, and redness were significantly lower 10 min after spraying on the TSW-treated side in comparison with the untreated side, as assessed by the patients (P < 0.05). Two days after fractional resurfacing, dryness and redness were still improved on the TSW-treated side. The investigator's evaluation revealed that erythema, the only perceivable sign following irradiation, was significantly reduced by TSW spraying (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This split-face comparative study conducted in patients with dermal melasma showed that spraying TSW after fractional laser resurfacing significantly reduced short-term adverse effects associated with the procedure.",
