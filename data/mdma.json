      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Rapidly acting therapeutics like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) are promising treatments for disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, understanding who benefits most and the underlying neural mechanisms remains a critical gap. Stratifying individuals by neural circuit profiles could help differentiate neural, behavioral, and affective responses to MDMA, enabling personalized treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether baseline stratification of individuals based on negative affect circuit profiles, particularly in response to nonconscious threat stimuli, can differentiate acute responses to MDMA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial, implementing a double-blinded, within-participant, placebo- and baseline-controlled design, was conducted at Stanford University School of Medicine between November 2, 2021, and November 9, 2022, for wave 1 data collection. Participants had used MDMA on at least 2 prior occasions, but not in the past 6 months, and had subthreshold PTSD symptoms and early life trauma but no current psychiatric disorders. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2023, to January 1, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed 4 visits: 1 baseline session followed by 1 placebo session and 2 MDMA sessions in a randomized order, totaling 64 visits. Baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessed the negative affect circuit using a nonconscious threat processing task (NTN). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included activity and connectivity of amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) defining the negative affect circuit. Secondary outcomes were behavioral measures of implicit threat bias, likability of threat expressions, and affective assessments. RESULTS: Sixteen participants (10 [63%] female; mean [SD] age, 40.8 [7.6] years) were stratified into subgroups with high and low levels of NTN activity in the amygdala (NTNA+ [n = 8] and NTNA- [n = 8], respectively), based on a median split of baseline nonconscious threat-evoked fMRI responses. Following administration of the 120 mg of MDMA vs placebo, the NTNA+ subgroup showed significant reductions in amygdala (contrast estimate [CE], -1.43; 95% CI, -2.60 to -0.27; Cohen d, -1.22; P = .02) and sgACC activity (CE, -1.48; 95% CI, -2.42 to -0.54; Cohen d, -1.56; P = .004), increased sgACC-amygdala connectivity (CE, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.02-1.28; Cohen d, 1.02; P = .04), and increased likability of threat expressions (CE, 14.38; 95% CI, 1.46-27.29; Cohen d, 0.86; P = .03) compared with the NTNA- subgroup. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of MDMA's acute profiles, 120 mg of MDMA acutely normalized negative affect circuit reactivity in participants stratified by heightened amygdala reactivity at baseline, demonstrating the potential of neuroimaging to identify prospective biomarkers and guide personalized MDMA-based therapies.

      "abstract": "Pathological narcissism (PN) is a complex, treatment-resistant disorder characterized by unstable self-esteem that fluctuates between grandiosity and vulnerability, complicating the formation of a stable self-image. With few empirically supported therapies, treatment has traditionally relied on long-term psychoanalytic approaches, but these often face high attrition. Recent research suggests a potential therapeutic synergy between psychedelics and psychoanalytic therapy, offering a novel approach to addressing entrenched personality structures. Studies on MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a compound known for enhancing empathy, trust, and social interactions, demonstrate potential to reopen critical periods for social learning in adults, offering the possibility of therapeutic benefits for conditions with core issues in relatedness, such as PN. MDMA promotes psychological flexibility and openness, allowing for deeper self-exploration and strengthening the observing ego, considered in psychoanalytic therapy to be an essential component for recognizing and modifying maladaptive patterns. By reducing fear-based avoidance in the brain, MDMA facilitates access to unconscious emotions, helping individuals process overwhelming feelings linked to early relational trauma commonly seen in PN. Additionally, MDMA's capacity to enhance compassion and empathy can fortify the therapeutic alliance, increasing its potential to facilitate relational change. This paper presents an MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) tailored for narcissistic patients which is currently being conducted as an investigator-initiated trial (IIT). It explores the model's theoretical foundations, mechanisms of change, treatment framework, and clinical challenges. Combining MDMA with an evidence-based depth therapy like psychoanalytic psychotherapy may offer an innovative treatment for conditions associated with attachment and developmental trauma, particularly personality disorders. While the role of psychotherapy in psychedelic treatments remains a topic of debate, with some proposing psychedelics be administered without psychotherapy, we assert that individuals with early relational trauma stand the most to gain from an integrated psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) model, where MDMA enhances the therapeutic alliance and emotional openness while psychoanalytic interventions provide the structure for lasting change."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental disorders, including anxiety and depression, impact nearly 1 billion people worldwide. Recent research has highlighted the potential of certain amphetamine compounds in the therapy of psychiatric disorders, with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) emerging as a promising candidate. AIM: This study investigates the effects of MDMA on anxiety and social behaviours using 3-week-old zebrafish. Additionally, the role of oxytocin in regulating these behaviours was examined through the use of an oxytocin receptor agonist (WAY-267,464) and antagonist (L-368,899). METHODS: Behavioural effects were assessed using the novel exploration test, light-dark preference test and social preference test. To explore the underlying mechanisms, changes in gene expression in serotonin, oxytocin and vasopressin systems and changes in AKT and EKR1/2 signalling pathways were analysed. RESULTS: Acute MDMA exposure reduced thigmotactic behaviour and increased the social preference index, indicating anxiolytic and prosocial effects. However, these effects were biphasic - the lowest tested dose of 0.5 μM showed anxiogenic and prosocial effects. As the concentration increased, these effects reversed, with a peak at 2.5 μM. MDMA suppressed the expression of serotonin receptors (htr1b and htr2b) and transporter (scl6a4) genes while increasing oxytocin receptors (oxtra and oxtrb) genes, decreasing vasopressin receptor (avpr1aa) gene expression, and reducing AKT phosphorylation. The oxytocin receptor agonist mimicked MDMA's effects, while the antagonist had no significant effect on anxiety or social behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA demonstrates therapeutic potential for treating anxiety disorders and social impairments. Moreover, 3-week-old zebrafish proved to be a valuable model for neurobehavioural research and high-throughput screening of psychiatric treatments.",

Central to this therapy is the role of touch, yet its empirical evaluation in MDMA-AT, and psychotherapy in general, remains limited. The use of touch in combination with MDMA raises concerns about power imbalances and ethical boundaries. METHODS: This article reviews existing literature on therapeutic touch and introduces the Touch Outcomes Measurement Inventory (TOMI). The TOMI is developed to assess client perceptions of touch in MDMA-AT, addressing a critical gap in the current research landscape. RESULTS: The main outcome of this research is the creation of TOMI, a tool aimed at evaluating the impact of touch on clients in MDMA-AT. The review highlights the lack of empirical evidence in this area and the necessity for such a measure. DISCUSSION: With the increasing likelihood of MDMA-AT becoming a widely used therapy, understanding how therapeutic touch affects clients is imperative. This article emphasizes the need for evidence-based and ethical guidelines for the use of touch in MDMA-AT. The development of TOMI is a step towards achieving this, providing a means for researchers and program evaluators to assess the implications of touch in MDMA-AT and psychedelic-assisted therapy more generally."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate published and unpublished systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the safety and efficacy of methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. METHODS: Six bibliometric databases and grey literature were searched from inception to 9 May 2024 for systematic reviews on the safety and efficacy of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy compared to psychotherapy alone among adults with post-traumatic stress disorder. Quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 tool was conducted independently by two investigators. RESULTS: Fourteen systematic reviews comprising 20 primary studies involving up to 353 participants were included. All reviews included studies of one-to-three sessions of 50-125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (some with supplemental dosage) compared to either 25-40 mg of MDMA or inactive placebo with psychotherapy. Four were deemed high quality. Meta-analyses reported substantial benefits of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in improving post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (standardised mean difference, 0.8-1.3), response rate (relative risk, 1.3-3.5) and remission rate (relative risk, 2.3-2.9) compared to psychotherapy alone. However, for reviews that assessed the certainty of evidence, the evidence was rated as low to very low certainty due to high risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision. There was moderate-quality evidence that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was associated with an increased odd of transient adverse events. However, reviews noted reliance on spontaneous rather than systematic adverse event reporting, discrepancies between adverse events reported in published studies and clinical trial registries, and a lack of long-term safety data. CONCLUSION: Four high-quality systematic reviews suggest low to very low certainty evidence for efficacy outcomes and moderate to very low quality evidence for safety outcomes.",

At the beginning of treatment, the patient did not experience any acute subjective effects of LSD at a dose of 200 µg. After increasing the LSD dose to 400 µg, he experienced subjective acute effects, and the first lasting therapeutic effects were observed. After changing from LSD to MDMA at both high doses (150-175 mg) and repeated low doses (12.5-25 mg), the patient exhibited marked improvements in neuropathic pain that were sustained even after stopping repeated MDMA treatment. MDMA mini/microdosing has not yet been broadly investigated. This case documents benefits of low doses of MDMA for the treatment of a pain disorder. Further research is needed on effects of MDMA on pain."

      "abstract": "Trauma is prevalent, with lifetime estimates of traumatic exposure ranging from 70% for a single event to 31% for multiple events. While many recover, a subset develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating condition characterized by distressing memories, avoidance behaviors, hyperarousal, and mood disturbances. The National Comorbidity Survey reports a lifetime PTSD prevalence of 6.8%, with higher rates among women and veterans. PTSD is strongly associated with suicidality, depression, and substance use, and its chronic nature can cause significant functional impairment. Despite extensive research, only two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline, are available for PTSD. Psychotherapy, including trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), has shown efficacy. Recent interest has grown in using psychedelics and entactogens such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for PTSD. Early-phase clinical trials of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) showed promising results, leading the FDA to grant breakthrough therapy status to MDMA-AT in 2017. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials demonstrated significant reductions in PTSD symptoms, with nearly 70% of participants no longer meeting diagnostic criteria. However, in 2024, the FDA voted against MDMA approval, citing concerns about trial design (including blinding failure and lack of certain safety assessments including QT prolongation and abuse liability assessments), as well as concerns about allegations of potential misconduct. Ongoing research must address key challenges, including blinding, long-term safety, and variability in psychotherapy, to better understand the therapeutic potential of MDMA in PTSD treatment. The FDA's recent guidance on psychedelic trials provides a framework for future research. The objective of this article is to explore the potential of MDMA-AT in PTSD treatment, evaluate regulatory challenges following the FDA's recent decision, and highlight the need for ongoing research to address safety, efficacy, and therapeutic implementation.",

The study includes 222 social workers randomized to read one of two vignettes about MDMA-AT or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-assisted therapy (SSRI-AT) for treating adolescent treatment-resistant PTSD. Participants rated each treatment's acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility, followed by drug stigma, perceptions of drug risk, and psychedelic knowledge. Participants in the SSRI-AT condition reported significantly higher mean ratings of treatment acceptability (p < .001; d = .72), appropriateness (p < .001; d = .72), and feasibility (p < .001; d =. 64). In the MDMA-AT condition, perceptions of MDMA risk were greater (p < .001; d = .59) and psychedelic stigma positively correlated with perceived risk of MDMA (r = .46, p < .001). Moreover, greater psychedelic knowledge was significantly related to less stigma (r = -.33, p < .001) and less perceived risk of MDMA (r = -.21, p < .001). Concerns among social workers about the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of MDMA-AT for adolescents with PTSD may limit clinical trial recruitment, engagement, and future implementation.",

MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for PTSD is a promising intervention currently being evaluated in numerous studies worldwide, including investigation for potential Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the United States. The concepts of set and setting are foundational in psychedelic therapy and refer to the mindset a person brings to therapy and the environment in which it takes place, respectively. Both are believed to play a critical role in the individual's experience and efficacy of MDMA-AT. In this article, we describe the importance of set and setting in MDMA-AT for PTSD and outline the advantages and challenges of implementing this novel intervention in large healthcare settings such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Mostly derived from our experience conducting clinical trials of MDMA-AT for PTSD in VHA, we present specific and practical suggestions for optimizing set and setting from both the participant's and clinician's perspective in a manner that both leverages the opportunities of such settings and adapts to their challenges. These recommendations are intended to inform future MDMA-AT for PTSD research and, potentially, eventual clinical implementation efforts in traditional healthcare systems."

      "abstract": "3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; commonly referred to as \"ecstasy\" or \"molly\") is a substituted amphetamine drug that is used recreationally for its acute psychoactive effects, including euphoria and increased energy, as well as prosocial effects such as increased empathy and feelings of closeness with others. Acute adverse effects can include hyperthermia, dehydration, bruxism, and diaphoresis. Post-intoxication phenomena may include insomnia, anhedonia, anxiety, depression, and memory impairment, which can persist for days following drug cessation. MDMA acts as a releasing agent for monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT), by interfering with vesicular storage and transporter function, thus increasing extracellular levels of DA, NE, and 5-HT. Medical intervention in response to adverse events is complicated by the fact that illicitly-acquired MDMA is frequently adulterated, contaminated, or outright replaced with other psychoactive drugs such as synthetic cathinones (\"bath salts\") or methamphetamine, often unknown to the person using the drug. This review provides background on the legal status of MDMA and its use patterns, including proposals for its use as an adjunct in psychotherapy. It also discusses the pharmacological properties, mental and physical health effects, and interactions of MDMA with other drugs, with special focus on harm reduction strategies. This information will help healthcare providers assess adverse health effects related to MDMA/ecstasy use in order to facilitate appropriate treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "MDMA (i.e., 3,4-methylenedixoymethamphetamine), commonly known as \"Ecstasy\" or \"Molly,\" has been used since the 1970s both in recreational and therapeutic settings. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated MDMA-Assisted Therapy (MDMA-AT) as a Breakthrough Therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 2017, and the FDA is requiring an additional phase 3 trial after rejecting the initial New Drug Application in 2024. Unlike other psychedelics, MDMA uniquely induces prosocial subjective effects of heightened trust and self-compassion while maintaining ego functioning as well as cognitive and perceptual lucidity. While recreational use in nonmedical settings may still cause harm, especially due to adulterants or when used without proper precautions, conclusions that can be drawn from studies of recreational use are limited by many confounds. This especially limits the extent to which evidence related to recreational use can be extrapolated to therapeutic use. A considerable body of preliminary evidence suggests that MDMA-AT delivered in a controlled clinical setting is a safe and efficacious treatment for PTSD. After a course of MDMA-AT involving three MDMA administrations supported by psychotherapy, 67%-71% of individuals with PTSD no longer meet diagnostic criteria after MDMA-AT versus 32%-48% with placebo-assisted therapy, and effects endure at long-term follow-up. This review primarily aims to distinguish evidence of recreational use in nonclinical settings versus MDMA-AT using pharmaceutical-grade MDMA in controlled clinical settings. This review further describes the putative neurobiological mechanisms of MDMA underlying its therapeutic effects, the clinical evidence of MDMA-AT, considerations at the level of public health and policy, and future research directions.",

      "abstract": "The recent rejection of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a dramatic moment in the re-emergence of psychedelic research. In this perspective, I argue that it represents a case study for paradigmatic tensions within psychopharmacology. The regulatory system is still influenced by a paradigm that sees the therapeutic effects of drugs as primarily biological, and context is noise to control for. An emergent paradigm considers the therapeutic effects of drugs as interactive with context. Psychedelics are the anomaly that questions the dominant paradigm, mainly due to the determination of psychedelic researchers that the medicines are drugs with psychotherapy. While some of the critique offered by the FDA towards MAPS/Lykos's studies is crucial, much of it is related to the experiential and psychotherapeutic elements - which the FDA claims not to regulate. This leads to some paradoxes within the regulatory procedure, which hint at a need for a shift in how psychedelic-assisted therapy is regulated and researched. Both regulators and researchers will need to find ways to accommodate each other in service of a successful integration of a new paradigm in which drugs and psychotherapy interact.",

The aim of this review is to report on outcomes of clinical trials for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for adults with depression and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and discuss recommendations for exploring these treatments in adolescent populations. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been encouraging data supporting the use of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for depression, including previously treatment-resistant symptoms. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is showing similar promise in treating PTSD, with excellent response and remission rates that appear durable. However, no studies have looked at the use of these treatments in younger patients. The safety and efficacy of psychedelic- and MDMA-assisted psychotherapies should be investigated in adolescents, especially considering the burden of untreated and undertreated psychiatric illness in youth, and the benefits of a potentially earlier, more effective, and more tolerable recovery process. Research and implementation should be tailored to the needs of this population, and equity and access should be considered at every stage. In this novel and rapidly evolving landscape, the psychiatric community is encouraged to advocate for safe, appropriate, and inclusive inquiry into, and application and scaling of these treatment models in adolescent patients.",

      "abstract": "Midomafetamine (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) is under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration review for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in adults. MDMA is metabolized by CYP2D6 and is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, as well as a weak inhibitor of renal transporters MATE1, OCT1, and OCT2. A pharmacokinetic phase I study was conducted to evaluate the effects of food on MDMA pharmacokinetics. The results of this study, previously published pharmacokinetic data, and in vitro data were combined to develop and verify MDMA population pharmacokinetic and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models. The food effect study demonstrated that a high-fat/high-calorie meal did not alter MDMA plasma concentrations, but delayed Tmax. The population pharmacokinetic model did not identify any clinically meaningful covariates, including age, weight, sex, race, and fed status. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic model simulated pharmacokinetics for the proposed 120 and 180 mg MDMA HCl clinical doses under single- and split-dose (2 h apart) conditions, indicating minor differences in overall exposure, but lower AUC within the first 4 h and delayed Tmax when administered as a split dose compared to a single dose. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic model also investigated the drug-drug interaction magnitude by varying the fraction metabolized by a representative CYP2D6 substrate (atomoxetine) and evaluated inhibition of renal transporters. The simulations confirm MDMA is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, but likely has no meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of drugs sensitive to renal transport. This model-informed drug development approach was employed to inform drug-drug interaction potential and predict pharmacokinetics of clinically relevant dosing regimens of MDMA.",

      "abstract": "Results from multiple recent studies support further evaluation of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in conjunction with psychotherapy (i.e., MDMA-Assisted Therapy) in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In two Phase 3 trials, MDMA-Assisted Therapy comprised a short-term, intensive psychotherapy that included three sessions directly facilitated by MDMA (referred to as \"experimental sessions\"), as well as a number of non-drug psychotherapy sessions. This treatment model aimed to harness the potential of MDMA to facilitate recall and processing of traumatic memories, and to increase learning in a social context, integrating \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" approaches to trauma-focused care. To date, the conceptual framework for this treatment has not been described in the scientific literature. This omission has contributed to misunderstandings about both the theoretical underpinnings of this modality and the therapeutic approach that emerges from it. This paper delineates the psychotherapeutic concepts, theories, and historical antecedents underlying the inner-directed approach to MDMA-Assisted Therapy for PTSD. Broadly speaking, this therapeutic framework centered the concept of the participant's inner healing intelligence as the primary agent of change, with the therapeutic relationship being the core facilitative condition fostering the participant's self-directed movement toward recovery and growth. Corollaries to this holistic, self-directed, relational, and trauma-informed framework include a non-pathologizing approach to the participant's embodied experience (including the possibility of intense emotional and somatic expression, experiences of multiplicity, suicidal ideation, and multigenerational and transpersonal experiences), as well as the therapists' own psychodynamic, somatic, and transpersonal awareness, empathic attunement, relational skillfulness, and cultural humility. The use of MDMA in conjunction with this psychotherapy platform outperformed the use of placebo with psychotherapy in Phase 2 and 3 trials, as measured by symptom reduction in participants with PTSD. However, within-group comparisons also identified significant symptom reduction in participants who did not receive MDMA, lending empirical support to the psychotherapy model itself. In addition to comparative efficacy trials, future research should investigate which elements of the conceptual framework and therapeutic approach underlie the clinical benefit in individuals with PTSD."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or ecstasy) is a recreational drug being investigated for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Acute hyponatremia is a potentially serious complication after even a single dose of MDMA. The assumed etiology has been a vasopressin release inducing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis combined with increased thirst, causing polydipsia and water intoxication. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and severity of hyponatremia after a single dose of MDMA, underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms of action, and the potential effect of fluid restriction on lowering the incidence of hyponatremia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This ad hoc secondary analysis pooled data from 4 placebo-controlled crossover randomized clinical trials conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. The 96 participants received experimental doses of MDMA between March 1, 2017, and August 31, 2022. INTERVENTION: A single oral 100- or 125-mg dose of MDMA. Fluid intake was not restricted in 81 participants; it was restricted in 15. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma oxytocin, copeptin (marker of vasopressin), and sodium levels were measured repeatedly within 360 minutes after MDMA intake. The association of plasma oxytocin or copeptin levels with plasma sodium level at 180 minutes (peak concentration of MDMA) was determined. RESULTS: Among the 96 participants, the mean (SD) age was 29 (7) years, and 62 (65%) were men. A total of 39 participants (41%) received a 100-mg dose of MDMA, and 57 (59%) received a 125-mg dose. At baseline, the mean (SD) plasma sodium level was 140 (3) mEq/L and decreased in response to MDMA by 3 (3) mEq/L. Hyponatremia occurred in 30 participants (31%) with a mean (SD) sodium level of 133 (2) mEq/L. In 15 participants with restricted fluid intake, no hyponatremia occurred, while in the 81 participants with unrestricted fluid intake, hyponatremia occurred in 30 (37%) (P = .002) with a difference in plasma sodium of 4 (95% CI, 2-5) mEq/L (P < .001) between both groups, suggesting that fluid restriction may mitigate the risk of hyponatremia. At baseline, the mean (SD) plasma oxytocin level was 87 (45) pg/mL and increased in response to MDMA by 388 (297) pg/mL (ie, a mean [SD] 433% [431%] increase at 180 minutes), while the mean (SD) copeptin level was 4.9 (3.8) pmol/L and slightly decreased, by 0.8 (3.0) pmol/L. Change in plasma sodium level from baseline to 180 minutes demonstrated a negative correlation with the changes in oxytocin (R = -0.4; P < .001) and MDMA (R = -0.4; P < .001) levels while showing no correlation with the change in copeptin level. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials, a high incidence of acute hyponatremia was observed in response to MDMA, which may be mitigated by fluid restriction. Hyponatremia was associated with acute oxytocin but not copeptin release. This challenges the current hypothesis of direct vasopressin release and rather indicates that oxytocin mimics the effect of vasopressin in the kidneys due to structural homology.",

Multivariable linear regression was used to identify predictors of openness to clinical use. Most participants (71.2%) were female and White (85.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 45.5 (12.7) years. Registered nurses (25.4%) and physicians (17.7%) comprised the largest professional groups. Respondents endorsed strong belief in therapeutic promise, and moderate openness to clinical use and support for legal access to both substances, with higher overall ratings for psilocybin compared to MDMA. Objective knowledge items revealed low knowledge of therapeutic uses, risks, and pharmacology. Primary concerns were lack of trained providers, financial cost, and potential contraindications. Prior psychedelic use, self-rated knowledge, younger age, and professional role predicted openness to clinical use of psilocybin and MDMA, with physicians reporting lower openness. As psychedelics continue to garner popular and scientific interest, results indicate a pressing need for additional formal training to provide balanced, evidence-based information from trusted sources.",

METHODS: A health state-transition model was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-AT for treating patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity. Both treatment arms consisted of 3 preparation (90-min), 3 interventional (8-h), and 9 integration (90-min) sessions, lasting ~4 months total. All sessions included psychotherapy, with interventional also including MDMA or placebo. After receiving treatment, patients were distributed across health states of No PTSD (not meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria), Non-Severe PTSD (treatment responders), Severe PTSD (treatment non-responders), and death. Each state had unique healthcare costs and utilities sourced from real-world data analysis and patient data from MDMA-AT clinical trials (including long-term follow-up). The base-case analysis considered the payer's perspective with a 5-year horizon, 3.5% annual cost and effect discounts, and an assumed MDMA medication price of $12,000 per session. Trial-derived utilities and US life tables mortality data were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The main outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with a $150,000 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. RESULTS: The base-case ICER was $83,845 per QALY. Total direct costs were $64,745 in the MDMA-AT and $33,132 in the PT arms ($31,613 increment). The costs of intervention were $48,376 for MDMA-AT and $12,376 for PT. The highest MDMA medication cost to fit under the WTP threshold was $20,314 per session. Costs related to PTSD healthcare visits and other PTSD treatments were lower with MDMA-AT than PT (-$2,511 and -$1,877 increments, respectively). Utility benefits were higher in MDMA-AT than PT, with 3.691 and 3.314 QALYs generated over 5 years, respectively (0.377 QALY increment). CONCLUSION: These data suggest MDMA-AT may be a cost-effective treatment compared to PT for patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity.",

      "abstract": "3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) assisted therapy has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for PTSD and emerging research suggests a change in personality traits may be a factor in treatment response. Most prior research on MDMA and personality has focused on cross-sectional comparisons of MDMA users and non-users; as such, well-controlled research assessing personality and affective states change following MDMA vs placebo administration is needed. In the current pre-registered study, we investigated the impact of MDMA administration on five-factor model (FFM) traits and affective states before and 48 h after drug administration in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of healthy adults (N = 34). Statistical significance was not observed for the four a priori hypotheses; however, medium effect sizes were found between MDMA administration and trait Openness and Positive Affect 48 h following drug administration, compared to placebo (d = .79 and .51, respectively). This study provides initial results to help guide future well-powered studies with large samples and longer follow-up timepoints to continue to investigate how MDMA impacts personality and emotional experience, which may inform optimization of MDMA treatment approaches."

      "abstract": "3, 4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA) has gained significance over the years, especially at rave festivals, as a recreational drug for its noted effects in mood enhancement and autonomic stimulation. While these effects have been noted, severe adverse outcomes, and even death, following the ingestion of MDMA have been recorded. We present a 35-year-old male who ingested the drug at the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC), the largest electronic dance music festival in North America as of 2024 [1]. Every year, many young adults are brought to local hospitals from the festival for drug overdoses, hyperthermia, and dehydration. At the festival, the patient was witnessed to have a seizure, presented with altered mental status and deemed hyperthermic at 109 degrees Fahrenheit. For these reasons, he was rapidly intubated and submerged in an ice bath at the festival's medical tent. At the county hospital, the patient was diagnosed with multiorgan failure, cerebrovascular ischemia, and coagulopathy. He received life-saving treatment such as continuous renal replacement therapy as well as intubation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. MRI of the brain showed central- embolic infarcts and the patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for eight days. After twenty days of inpatient treatment, the patient was discharged. He was discharged with his mental status at baseline and without gross neurologic deficits. A permacath was placed for hemodialysis to be continued outpatient. This case report highlights the importance of prompt medical management which can be crucial for patient survival following a life-threatening overdose with MDMA. It also exemplifies the need for increasing social awareness regarding the severe and detrimental outcomes an MDMA overdose can cause as this drug continues to be widely used in the setting of rave and music festivals."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder resulting from exposure to traumatic events, manifesting in various debilitating symptoms. Despite available treatments, many individuals experience inadequate response or significant side effects. Previous reviews suggest promising outcomes with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AT), but limitations prompt the need for a comprehensive evaluation. METHODS: We searched various online databases and registries such as MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov to retrieve RCTs that fit our inclusion criteria. We performed meta-analyses using Review Manager by applying a random-effects model. Dichotomous and continuous outcomes were pooled as risk ratios (RR) and standard mean difference (SMD), respectively. RESULTS: Nine studies with a total of 297 participants with PTSD were included in our meta-analysis. The control group consisted of inactive doses of MDMA (25-40 mg) or placebo. Our meta-analysis showed that MDMA-AT led to a significant reduction in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) severity scores as compared to the control group (SMD -1.10, 95% CI: -1.62 to -0.59). More patients in the MDMA-AT group exhibited significant response (RR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.08) and remission (RR 2.32, 95% CI: 1.47 to 3.66) as compared to patients in the control group. There was no significant difference regarding the incidence of ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), ≥1 severe TEAE, and suicidal ideation between the two groups. CONCLUSION: MDMA-AT demonstrates significant efficacy in improving PTSD symptoms, enhancing both response and remission rates in individuals with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD, while maintaining a favorable safety profile.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurorehabilitation in military populations is complicated by higher rates of PTSD and unique characteristics of military institutions. These factors can adversely impact the patient-therapist therapeutic alliance and engagement with the rehabilitation process leading to poorer outcomes. MDMA is a non-classical psychedelic with pro-social and fear regulating properties. MDMA-assisted therapy is being explored as a novel treatment for PTSD that potentially offers rapid symptom improvement and enhances therapeutic alliance. OBJECTIVE: A review of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD is provided in the context of neurorehabilitation in military populations. The molecular mechanism of MDMA is outlined and a novel application of MDMA for neurorehabilitation is proposed. METHODS: This is an expert review and synthesis of the literature. RESULTS: Results from late-stage clinical trials suggest MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD would be of particular benefit for military populations with PTSD. The unique pro-social properties of MDMA could be leveraged to enhance the therapeutic alliance and patient engagement during neurorehabilitation. CONCLUSION: The unique qualities and benefits of MDMA and MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD suggest relevant application in military personnel undergoing neurorehabilitation. There are many similarities in patient-therapist dynamics in PTSD treatment and neurorehabilitation. The properties of MDMA which enhance therapeutic alliance, downregulate fear, and increase cognitive flexibility would potentially benefit both military personnel with and without PTSD undergoing neurorehabilitation.",

A promising therapeutic intervention is the integration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and psychotherapy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated MDMA- assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) as a Breakthrough Therapy for PTSD based on results from six Phase 2 clinical trials. Case data from the first study evaluating MDMA-AT study for AUD found the treatment was well tolerated and alcohol use was significantly reduced post treatment. METHODS: This manuscript reports the premise, design, and methodology of the first open-label trial of MDMA-AT for military veterans (N = 12) with PTSD and AUD. Neuroimaging and biomarker data are included to evaluate brain changes, and neuroinflammation, pre-post treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical component (comorbidity) and the regulatory processes (Schedule I drug) for setting up this clinical trial are long and complex. The research community will benefit from this work to establish common clinical trial outcomes, standardized protocols, and risk assessments for FDA approval. CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT05943665."

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a synthetic amphetamine derivative with notable psychoactive properties and emerging therapeutic potential, particularly for treating post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and substance use disorders. However, its use remains controversial due to inter-individual variability influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. In this context, pharmacogenomics could play a crucial role in guiding MDMA treatment by identifying individuals with genetic predispositions affecting their response to MDMA. Tailoring treatment plans based on individual's genetic makeup may enhance therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects, leading to safer and more effective use of MDMA in clinical settings. Literature analysis reveals that the influence of genetic variants within genes encoded for enzymes involved in MDMA metabolism and/or pharmacodynamics (PD) targets have been relatively under-investigated in humans. Some studies have pointed out associations between MDMA-induced effects and polymorphisms. For example, the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism has been associated with cognitive and cardiovascular MDMA-induced effects. Similarly, polymorphisms in the serotonin-linked promoter region (5HTTLPR) have been associated with several MDMA-induced adverse effects including mood disorders. However, despite these findings, only a few associations have been highlighted. Furthermore, some genes encoded for MDMA targets have been only poorly investigated, representing a significant research gap. These observations underscore the need for large-scale, controlled pharmacogenomics studies focusing on a broad panel of genes involved into MDMA pharmacokinetics and PD. Such studies could provide critical insights for optimizing MDMA's therapeutic use and minimizing its risks."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Illicit drug consumption is associated with public health effects and criminal activities. This study aimed to estimate Illicit drug consumption and annual market in the Netherlands from wastewater analysis of drug residues. METHODS: Residues of cocaine, amphetamine and 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) were measured between 2015 and 2022 in 30 Dutch wastewater treatment plants serving both rural and urban populations. These wastewater treatment plants covered 20% of the total Dutch population. The Dutch annual retail market was estimated by extrapolating consumption to the total Dutch population, back-calculating consumption volume, correcting for drug purity and street price collected in voluntary checking services, and accounting for the correlation of consumption and urbanity. RESULTS: The per capita MDMA and cocaine consumption correlated positively with the urbanity of the wastewater treatment plant catchments with r2 of 31% and 64%, respectively. Amphetamine did not show a significant correlation with urbanity. The three studied drugs were conservatively estimated to cover an average annual market value of 903 (95% prediction interval 829 to 987) million Euro for the studied period. Market estimations from prevalence figures and interceptions of international trade were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Illicit drug consumption in the Netherlands appears to correlate positively with urban (in contrast to rural) areas. Wastewater analysis can be used to estimate the volume and monetary value of illicit drug markets as a proof of concept.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Studies of psychedelic-assisted therapy with LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, and related substances show clinical promise but inadequately assess side effects. Measuring side effects is challenging because they are not always easily differentiated from treatment effects or disease symptoms and show high heterogeneity, variable duration and impact, and sensitivity to context. A systematic questionnaire describing important characteristics of side effects of psychedelics and MDMA would greatly improve on previous methods. We aimed to create a standardized tool for recording clinically relevant side effects of psychedelics and MDMA, including their severity, duration, impact, and treatment-relatedness. METHODS: We constructed the Swiss Psychedelic Side Effects Inventory (SPSI) based on insights from previous research. It was pilot tested in 145 participants from three studies. Structured feedback from an expert panel was used to improve validity and feasibility. RESULTS: The final SPSI contains 32 side effects and standardized follow-up questions about their severity, impact, treatment-relatedness, and duration. It is compatible with any study design and can be administered as an interview or self-report at any timepoint after treatment with psychedelics or MDMA. LIMITATIONS: The SPSI omits relatively unimportant side effects for brevity's sake, though space for additional symptoms is given. Future studies are needed to confirm its validity in different contexts. CONCLUSIONS: The SPSI is available in English and German for collecting systematic data on side effects from psychedelics and MDMA. This information is vital for improving clinical decisions, informed consent, and patient safety.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Frontline antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) leave many patients with unmet treatment needs. Moreover, even when SSRIs reduce depressive symptoms, anhedonia, the loss of pleasure to previously rewarding activities, often remains unabated. This state of affairs is disheartening and calls for the development of medications to more directly treat anhedonia. The atypical psychedelic 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) might have promise as a prohedonic medication given its efficacious applications for treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder and comorbid depression. However, in addition to its prosocial effects as an entactogen, MDMA is also associated with neurotoxic cognitive deficits. The present studies were designed to examine the relative potency of MDMA in female and male rats across three distinct behavioral domains to assist in defining a preclinical profile of MDMA as a candidate prohedonic therapeutic. METHODS: First, signal detection metrics of reward responsivity were examined using the touchscreen probabilistic reward task (PRT), a reverse-translated assay used to objectively quantify anhedonic phenotypes in humans. Second, to probe potential cognitive deficits, touchscreen-based assays of psychomotor vigilance and delayed matching-to-position were used to examine attentional processes and short-term spatial memory, respectively. Finally, MDMA's entactogenic effects were studied via pairwise assessments of social interaction facilitated by machine-learning analyses. RESULTS: Findings show (1) dose-dependent increases in reward responsivity as quantified by the PRT, (2) dose-dependent deficits in attention and short-term memory, and (3) dose-dependent increases in aspects of prosocial interaction in male but not female subjects. Neither the desirable (prohedonic) nor undesirable (cognition disruptive) effects of MDMA persisted beyond 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: The present results characterize MDMA as a promising prohedonic treatment, notwithstanding some liability for short-lived cognitive impairment following acute administration."

      "abstract": "Introduction: The positive results of MDMA from Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) call for a critical evaluation of its regulatory status within the European mental healthcare system. This is driven by the recent submission of MDMA-AT for FDA approval in the United States. Unless coordinated efforts in the European regulatory landscape start, there may be potential divergences in national regulatory strategies. Gaining insights from researchers and clinicians involved in the application of MDMA-AT may be useful in guiding the discussion of factors involved in its implementation.Method: A comprehensive invitation-only survey was sent to researchers and clinicians involved in MDMA-AT clinical trials and contributors to the scientific literature on MDMA-AT from around the globe. This study aimed to collect opinions on clinical practices, training, and regulation worldwide, examining the global best practices and pitfalls to outline strategies for possible European implementation of MDMA-AT.Results: The survey, which included responses from 68 experts, yielded a range of opinions where a large majority endorsed the need for training and standardization, emphasizing equity and access, stressing impediments in the national approval processes, and reflecting critically on anticipated spill-over effects of MDMA-AT in clinical settings.Conclusion: The experts highlight the need for science-informed policy development, active regulatory involvement, and international cooperation to incorporate MDMA-AT into the European mental healthcare system in general and the treatment of PTSD in particular. The study emphasizes the importance of ongoing research, open professional discourse, and collaborative engagement to facilitate MDMA-AT's ethical and effective implementation.",

      "abstract": "MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has shown potential as an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Preclinical studies involving rodents have demonstrated that MDMA can facilitate the extinction of fear memories. It has been noted that MDMA impacts oxytocin neurons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the role of oxytocinergic signaling and neuroinflammatory markers in the therapeutic effects of MDMA. To achieve this, male rats were subjected to a model of PTSD involving exposure to shock and situational reminders. MDMA was microinjected into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) before extinction training, followed by behavioral tests assessing activity levels, anxiety, and social function. Our findings indicate that MDMA treatment facilitated fear extinction and mitigated the shock-induced increase in freezing, as well as deficits in social behavior. Shock exposure led to altered expression of the gene coding for OXT-R and neuroinflammation in the mPFC and basolateral amygdala (BLA), which were restored by MDMA treatment. Importantly, the OXT-R antagonist L-368,899 prevented MDMA's therapeutic effects on extinction and freezing behavior. In conclusion, MDMA's therapeutic effects in the PTSD model are associated with alterations in OXT-R expression and neuroinflammation, and MDMA's effects on extinction and anxiety may be mediated by oxytocinergic signaling."

      "abstract": "MDMA can cause serious adverse effects on vital organs such as the heart, brain, and liver. Additionally, MDMA consumption can also potentially cause various endocrine system dysfunctions. The previous study has shown that pre-treatment of zinc can reduce the cytotoxicity of MDMA on the Leydig cell line (TM3). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the treatment with MDMA on the apoptosis of TM3 cells and the effects of zinc pre-treatment on reducing the apoptotic effects of MDMA. TM3 cells were incubated with MDMA (5 mM), zinc (8 µM), and zinc (8 µM) prior to MDMA (5 mM) for 48 h. The cells were pre-treated with zinc for 24 h prior to the administration of MDMA, and the total culture time was 48h. The effect of different treatment groups in causing oxidative stress and apoptosis in TM3 cells was measured by DCF, TUNNEL, and western blot tests, respectively. Our results revealed that the number of DCF and tunnel-positive cells increases as a result of MDMA treatment. In addition, the treatment with MDMA increased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins caspase 3, Bax, and p53. Conversely, the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreased. Zinc pre-treatment significantly decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and the number of tunnels and DCF-positive cells compared to the MDMA-only group. It is concluded that MDMA has a toxic effect and causes apoptosis on TM3 cells, and also, pre-treatment with zinc mitigates the ROS production and toxic effect of MDMA and MDMA-induced apoptosis in TM3 cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) impacts both individual and relational functioning. Veteran couples are at increased risk of relationship distress due to military stressors such as deployment, family reintegration, and traumatic stress. Although both Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) and its brief version (bCBCT) consistently have large effects on reducing PTSD symptoms, these treatments have more variable effects on relational outcomes. Given the impact of relationship functioning on the overall health of veterans, improving the effect of PTSD treatments on relationship functioning is an essential area of research. One promising path is the role of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)-assisted therapy in augmenting the relational impact of established therapeutic interventions such as bCBCT. METHOD/DESIGN: This is a single site, open-label study assessing the preliminary efficacy, safety, and acceptability of MDMA-assisted therapy in combination with bCBCT in 8 veterans with PTSD and their intimate partners (N = 16). Therapy teams trained in bCBCT and MDMA-assisted therapy will deliver bCBCT combined with two MDMA sessions and two couple emotion focused integration sessions. PTSD symptom severity and relationship functioning outcomes will be evaluated. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine the efficacy of MDMA-assisted bCBCT for improving PTSD and relationship functioning among a sample of U.S. military veterans and their partners. This project could provide an opportunity to pilot a scalable model of treating PTSD within the Veterans Affairs healthcare system and leverage the benefits of MDMA for veterans with PTSD, as well as the downstream benefits to their partner on both individual and relationship functioning.

Several studies have been carried out to assess potential long-term effects of a regular use on cognition, delivering distinct results for psychedelics and MDMA. However, to date knowledge is scarce on cognitive performance during acute effects of those substances. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigate how cognitive functioning is affected by psychedelics and MDMA during the acute drug effects and the sub-acute (\"afterglow\") window. Our quantitative analyses suggest that acute cognitive performance is differentially affected by psychedelics when compared to MDMA: psychedelics impair attention and executive function, whereas MDMA primarily affects memory, leaving executive functions and attention unaffected. Our qualitative analyses reveal that executive functioning and creativity may be increased during a window of at least 24 h after the acute effects of psychedelics have subsided, whereas no such results have been observed for MDMA. Our findings may contribute to inform recommendations on harm reduction for recreational settings and to help fostering differential approaches for the use of psychedelics and MDMA within a therapeutic framework.",

      "abstract": "Hyperthermia induced by phenethylamines, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), can lead to life-threatening complications and death. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and subsequent release of norepinephrine and activation of uncoupling proteins have been demonstrated to be the key mediators of phenethylamine-induced hyperthermia (PIH). Recently, the gut microbiome was shown to also play a contributing role in PIH. Here, the hypothesis that bile acids (BAs) produced by the gut microbiome are essential to PIH was tested. Changes in the serum concentrations of unconjugated primary BAs cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and secondary BA deoxycholic acid (DCA) were measured following MDMA (20 mg/kg, sc) treatment in antibiotic treated and control rats. MDMA-induced a significant hyperthermic response and reduced the serum concentrations of three BAs 60 min post-treatment. Pretreatment with antibiotics (vancomycin, bacitracin and neomycin) in the drinking water for five days resulted in the depletion of BAs and a hypothermic response to MDMA. Gut bacterial communities in the antibiotic-treated group were distinct from the MDMA or saline treatment groups, with decreased microbiome diversity and alteration in taxa. Metagenomic functions inferred using the bioinformatic tool PICRUSt2 on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that bacterial genes associated to BA metabolism are less abundant in the antibiotic-MDMA treated group. Overall, these findings suggest that gut bacterial produced BAs might play an important role in MDMA-induced hyperthermia.",

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is re-emerging in clinical settings as a candidate for the treatment of specific neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) in combination with psychotherapy. MDMA is a psychoactive drug, typically regarded as an empathogen or entactogen, which leads to transporter-mediated monoamine release. Despite its therapeutic potential, MDMA can induce dose-, individual-, and context-dependent untoward effects outside safe settings. In this study, we investigated whether three new methylenedioxy bioisosteres of MDMA improve its off-target profile. In vitro methods included radiotracer assays, transporter electrophysiology, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence-based assays, pooled human liver microsome/S9 fraction incubations, metabolic stability studies, isozyme mapping, and liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. In silico methods included molecular docking. Compared with MDMA, all three MDMA bioisosteres (ODMA, TDMA, and SeDMA) showed similar pharmacological activity at human serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine transporters (hSERT, hDAT, and hNET, respectively) but decreased agonist activity at 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptors. Regarding their hepatic metabolism, they differed from MDMA, with N-demethylation being the only metabolic route shared, and without forming phase II metabolites. In addition, TDMA showed an enhanced intrinsic clearance in comparison to its congeners. Additional screening for their interaction with human organic cation transporters (hOCTs) and plasma membrane monoamine transporter (hPMAT) revealed a weaker interaction of the MDMA analogs with hOCT1, hOCT2, and hPMAT. Our findings suggest that these new MDMA bioisosteres might constitute appealing therapeutic alternatives to MDMA, sparing the primary pharmacological activity at hSERT, hDAT, and hNET, but displaying a reduced activity at 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptors and alternative hepatic metabolism. Whether these MDMA bioisosteres may pose lower risk alternatives to the clinically re-emerging MDMA warrants further studies.",

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review and demonstrate the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to October 27, 2023, selected RCTs assessing the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD, and evaluated their quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Seven RCTs were selected from the retrieved references. The results revealed that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy effectively reduced the change from baseline score in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale in patients with PTSD compared with either placebo or active controls. However, MDMA causes a series of adverse events, including muscle tightness, nausea, and decreased appetite. To a certain extent, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may improve symptoms in patients with PTSD. However, side effects and abuse issues still seriously hinder clinical application of MDMA.",

Despite its deceptive reputation as \"safe,\" chronic MDMA use is associated with neuropsychiatric complications, including psychosis. We describe a case of a 23-year-old woman with chronic MDMA use disorder and childhood trauma, who presented with severe psychosis and catatonic features. While initial diagnostic possibilities included drug-induced psychosis and mood disorders, the patient's history and presentation supported a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder with psychotic features, which was exacerbated by MDMA use. Conventional antipsychotics failed to improve psychotic symptoms and led to worsening of catatonia, requiring electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for improvement. Socioeconomic barriers hindered follow-up care, leading to an Emergency Department (ED) admission shortly after discharge. This case highlights the intricate interplay between substance use, psychiatric illness, and trauma, and showcases ECT's efficacy in severe psychosis. It emphasizes the necessity for comprehensive mental health services, especially for vulnerable populations, and calls for further research into MDMA's psychiatric effects and optimal treatment approaches for individuals with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in patients with terminal illness and multiple challenges exist with timely and effective care in this population. Several centres have reported that one dose of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin, combined with therapeutic support, improves these symptoms for up to 6 months in this patient group. Drawing upon related therapeutic mechanisms, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy may have the potential to achieve similar, positive mental health outcomes in this group. Preliminary evidence also supports the tolerability of MDMA-assisted therapy for anxiety and depression in advanced-stage cancer. METHODS: Up to 32 participants with advanced-stage cancer and associated depression and anxiety will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into one of two blinded parallel treatment arms. The intervention group will receive 120 mg (+ 60 mg optional supplemental dose) MDMA-assisted therapy. The psychoactive control group will receive 20 mg oral (+ 10 mg optional supplemental dose) methylphenidate-assisted therapy. For each medication-assisted therapy session, participants will undergo two 90-min therapeutic support sessions in the week preceding, and one 90-min support session the day after the experimental session. A battery of measures (mood, anxiety, quality of life, mystical experience, spiritual wellbeing, attitudes towards death, personality traits, holistic health and wellbeing, connectedness, demoralisation, expectations, qualitative data and safety measures) will be assessed at baseline and through to the end of the protocol. Participants will be followed up until either 12 months post-randomisation or death, whichever occurs first. DISCUSSION: This study will examine the effect of MDMA-assisted therapy on symptoms of anxiety and depression in advanced-stage cancer. Potential therapeutic implications include establishing the safety and effectiveness of a novel treatment that may relieve mental suffering in patients with life-threatening illness.

      "abstract": "The phenylethylamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy'), is the prototypical example of an entactogen. Its original placement in highly restrictive drug usage categories in the US and UK, led to an inevitable restriction on MDMA neuroscience research and treatment. The dominant pharmacological effects of MDMA are its properties of release and inhibition of reuptake of amine neurotransmitter transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. MDMA is an agonist of a wide range of receptors; its mood-altering effects are mediated via 5-HT2A receptors; this receptor may also mediate its effects on body temperature, analgesia, and anxiolytic properties. The mechanisms underlying MDMA's entactogenic properties of sociability and interpersonal closeness are not known but release and involvement of oxytocin, a peptide thought by some to be involved in social bonding, has been suggested. Adverse effects of MDMA are mostly transient; acute multiorgan adverse effects occurring during raves or crowded dance gatherings include dehydration, hyperthermia, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute renal failure. Deaths following MDMA taken by itself are rare compared to fatalities following coadministration with other drugs. A recent FDA-approved phase 3 clinical trial of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) led to the conclusion that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment meriting expedited clinical evaluation. Despite the ongoing deliberations by the FDA and EMA for approval of MDMA treatment of PTSD, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) recently announced that after an evaluation of the therapeutic value, benefits, and risks of MDMA, it will permit its prescribing for the treatment of PTSD. Further examples of regulatory relaxation toward MDMA-assisted psychotherapy are underway. These include the FDA's recently approved clinical trial to assess MDMA's efficacy in the treatment of \"asociality\" in patients with schizophrenia and an open trial of MDMA treatment for alcohol-use disorder which showed decreased alcohol consumption. There are also ongoing studies on the little understood startle response, anxiety associated with life-threatening illness, and social anxiety in autistic adults.",

Literature searches were done on PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar and references reviewed in identified articles. MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD usually consists of a few preparatory sessions before two or three sessions where one or two oral doses of MDMA are given along with supportive psychotherapy. The therapy is delivered in the presence of two therapists for about eight hours each time. In addition, the patient receives up to 9 integrative sessions in due course. This use of MDMA as a part of psychotherapy for PTSD is proposed to lessen the psychological distress that often arises in the processing of traumatic events to facilitate the treatment process and reduce the risk of drop-out. Recent studies indicate that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy reduces PTSD symptoms and is generally well tolerated. These studies are necessary if this MDMA-assisted treatment is to be approved by licensing authorities. There is an urgent need for new effective treatments for PTSD and for comparisons between this MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and currently approved psychotherapies with and without MDMA-use.",

We conducted the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the side effects of MDMA-AP across indications. We also assessed the quality of side effects-reporting in published trials of MDMA-AP. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were systematically searched. Phase 2 and 3 MDMA-AP studies were included; Phase 1 studies, which assessed MDMA without psychotherapy, were not. Quality of side effects-reporting was assessed against the CONSORT Harms 2022 guidelines. We also compared numbers of adverse events reported in publications to those recorded in ClinicalTrial.gov registers. Thirteen studies were included, with eight contributing to the meta-analysis. In Phase 2 studies, MDMA-AP was associated with increased odds of any side effect during medication sessions (OR = 1.67, 95%CI (1.12, 2.49)) and in the 7 days following (OR = 1.59, 95%CI (1.12, 2.24)) relative to control conditions. In Phase 3 studies, MDMA-AP was associated with increased odds of any adverse event during the treatment period relative to placebo-assisted psychotherapy (OR = 3.51, 95%CI (2.76, 4.46)). The majority of RCTs were rated as having high risk of bias. Certainty of the evidence was rated as very low to moderate according to the GRADE framework. No included RCT had adequate adherence to the CONSORT Harms 2022 recommendations and reporting rates were also low. Compared to placebo, MDMA-AP was associated with increased odds of side effects, which were largely transient and mild or moderate in severity. However, identified limitations in existing evidence indicate that further investigation is needed to better characterize the safety profile of MDMA-AP and guide implementation.",

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ' ecstasy' ) is re-emerging in clinical settings as a candidate for the treatment of specific psychiatric disorders (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) in combination with psychotherapy. MDMA is a psychoactive drug, typically regarded as an empathogen or entactogen, which leads to transporter-mediated monoamine release. Despite its therapeutic potential, MDMA can induce dose-, individual-, and context-dependent untoward effects outside safe settings. In this study, we investigated whether three new methylenedioxy bioisosteres of MDMA improve its off-target profile. In vitro methods included radiotracer assays, transporter electrophysiology, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence-based assays, pooled human liver microsome/S9 fraction incubation with isozyme mapping, and liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. In silico methods included molecular docking. Compared with MDMA, all three MDMA bioisosteres (ODMA, TDMA, and SeDMA) showed similar pharmacological activity at human serotonin and dopamine transporters (hSERT and hDAT, respectively) but decreased activity at 5-HT 2A/2B/2C receptors. Regarding their hepatic metabolism, they differed from MDMA, with N -demethylation being the only metabolic route shared, and without forming phase II metabolites. Additional screening for their interaction with human organic cation transporters (hOCTs) and plasma membrane transporter (hPMAT) revealed a weaker interaction of the MDMA analogs with hOCT1, hOCT2, and hPMAT. Our findings suggest that these new MDMA analogs might constitute appealing therapeutic alternatives to MDMA, sparing the primary pharmacological activity at hSERT and hDAT, but displaying a reduced activity at 5-HT 2A/2B/2C receptors and reduced hepatic metabolism. Whether these MDMA bioisosteres may pose lower risk alternatives to the clinically re-emerging MDMA warrants further studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: After becoming notorious for its use as a party drug in the 1980s, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methampetamine (MDMA), also known by its street names \"molly\" and \"ecstasy,\" has emerged as a powerful treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: There are extensive data about the risk profile of MDMA. However, the literature is significantly biased. Animal models demonstrating neurotoxic or adverse effects used doses well beyond the range that would be expected in humans (up to 40 mg/kg in rats compared with roughly 1-2 mg/kg in humans). Furthermore, human samples often comprise recreational users who took other substances in addition to MDMA, in uncontrolled settings. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Phase III clinical trials led by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) have shown that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has an effect size of d = 0.7-0.91, up to 2-3 times higher than the effect sizes of existing antidepressant treatments. 67%-71% of patients who undergo MDMA-assisted psychotherapy no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD within 18 weeks. We also describe other promising applications of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treating alcohol use disorder, social anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions. LIMITATIONS: Thus far, almost all clinical trials on MDMA have been sponsored by a single organization, MAPS. More work is needed to determine whether MDMA-assisted therapy is more effective than existing nonpharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Phase III trials suggest that MDMA is superior to antidepressant medications for treating PTSD. Now that MAPS has officially requested the Food and Drug Administration to approve MDMA as a treatment for PTSD, legal MDMA-assisted therapy may become available as soon as 2024.",

However, there has been some concern regarding possible neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as cognitive impairment and dependence, emerging after abstinence. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the mechanism underlying cognitive impairment during MDMA withdrawal. To achieve this, we focused on the arachidonic acid cascade, which is related to addiction to some abusive drugs. METHODS: A novel object recognition task was used to investigate cognitive function in mice. Furthermore, we quantified prostaglandin E2 during MDMA withdrawal. RESULTS: The recognition index significantly decreased during withdrawal after repeated administration of MDMA (10mg/kg, i.p., once daily for 7 days), but not following co-administration of diclofenac (10mg/kg, i.p.), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. On day 1, following repeated MDMA treatment, prostaglandin E2 content significantly increased in the hippocampus but not in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that activation of the arachidonic acid cascade at least in the hippocampus is likely involved in the development of recognition memory impairment during MDMA withdrawal. Therefore, co-use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors with MDMA may reduce concerns regarding MDMA-induced impairment of recognition memory.",

On the other hand, the fact that MDMA acts to extinguish fear and to reconsolidate memory could be explored as an adjunct to psychotherapy during treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder. In this context, assessing MDMA toxicity is relevant, and tridimensional cell culture has emerged as an alternative to animal models in toxicity assessment.

The MTT reduction assay did not evidence significantly reduced cell viability. Moreover, MDMA did not increase reactive oxygen species production, deplete the mitochondrial membrane potential, arrest the cell cycle, or induce apoptotic cell death.

Improved understanding of the temporal relationship between methamphetamine, ecstasy/MDMA, or cocaine use with anxiety or depression informs public health interventions and treatment options for those experiencing this co-occurrence. This narrative systematic review sought to examine associations and temporality between the use of methamphetamine, ecstasy/MDMA, or cocaine, with anxiety or depressive symptoms. Method Systematic searches of 4 electronic databases were conducted up to August 2023. Study eligibility included the measurement of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, and frequency of illicit stimulant use (methamphetamine, cocaine, or ecstasy/MDMA) at two separate time points, with data analysis of the association between these variables. The Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Checklist was utilised to assess quality. Data was extracted, and a narrative synthesis incorporating an eight-criteria framework to assess associations was conducted. Results 4432 studies were screened for eligibility; 11 studies (3 RCTs and 8 prospective cohort studies) were included. Evidence for an association between depressive symptoms and methamphetamine use was demonstrated in six studies, with temporal evidence in three studies supporting methamphetamine use preceding depressive symptoms. Three studies reported an association between cocaine use and depressive symptoms. Evidence for associations with any of the illicit stimulants and anxiety symptoms was lacking. CONCLUSIONS: There was some evidence to support a case for temporality, particularly for methamphetamine use and depressive symptoms. Investing in longitudinal studies is pivotal to understanding the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between illicit stimulant use and anxiety or depressive symptoms. A limitation of the study was the variation in the measurement and analysis of outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that can become chronic and debilitating when left untreated. Available pharmacotherapies are limited, take weeks to show modest benefit and remain ineffective for up to 40% of patients. Methylone is currently in clinical development for the treatment of PTSD. Preclinical studies show rapid, robust and long-lasting antidepressant-like and anxiolytic effects. The mechanism of action underlying these effects is not yet fully understood. This study investigated the downstream gene expression changes and signaling pathways affected by methylone in key brain areas linked to PTSD and MDD. It also sought to determine whether neuroplasticity-related genes were involved. We compared effects of methylone with MDMA to explore similarities and differences in their brain effects because MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has recently shown benefit in clinical trials for PTSD and methylone is a structural analog of MDMA. METHODS: Monoamine binding, uptake and release studies were performed and a high-throughput-screen evaluated agonist/antagonist activities at 168 GPCRs in vitro. We used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to probe drug-induced gene expression changes in the amygdala and frontal cortex, two brain areas responsible for emotional learning that are affected by PTSD and MDD. Rats were treated with methylone or MDMA (both 10 mg/kg, IP), and their responses were compared with controls. We performed functional enrichment analysis to identify which pathways were regulated by methylone and/or MDMA. We confirmed changes in gene expression using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Methylone, a monoamine uptake inhibitor and releaser, demonstrated no off-target effects at 168 GPCRs, unlike MDMA, which showed activity at 5HT2A and 5HT2C receptors. RNA-seq results revealed significant regulation of myelin-related genes in the amygdala, confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In the frontal cortex, methylone significantly upregulated genes implicated in neuroplasticity. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that (1) methylone is a rapid-acting neuroplastogen that affects key brain substrates for PTSD and MDD and that (2) methylone appears to exhibit higher specificity and fewer off-target effects than MDMA. Together, these results are consistent with the reported clinical experiences of methylone and MDMA and bolster the potential use of methylone in the treatment of PTSD and, potentially, other neuropsychiatric disorders."

      "abstract": "There has been renewed interest in the use of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and serotonergic psychedelics in the treatment of multiple psychiatric disorders. Many of these compounds are known to produce prosocial effects, but how these effects relate to therapeutic efficacy and the extent to which prosocial effects are unique to a particular drug class is unknown. In this article, we present a narrative overview and compare evidence for the prosocial effects of MDMA and serotonergic psychedelics to elucidate shared mechanisms that may underlie the therapeutic process. We discuss 4 categories of prosocial effects: altered self-image, responses to social reward, responses to negative social input, and social neuroplasticity. While both categories of drugs alter self-perception, MDMA may do so in a way that is less related to the experience of mystical-type states than serotonergic psychedelics. In the case of social reward, evidence supports the ability of MDMA to enhance responses and suggests that serotonergic psychedelics may also do so, but more research is needed in this area. Both drug classes consistently dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli. Finally, preclinical evidence supports the ability of both drug classes to induce social neuroplasticity, promoting adaptive rewiring of neural circuits, which may be helpful in trauma processing. While both MDMA and serotonergic psychedelics produce prosocial effects, they differ in the mechanisms through which they do this. These differences affect the types of psychosocial interventions that may work best with each compound.",

      "abstract": "This comprehensive review delves into the intricate interplay between gender/sex and MDMA use, drawing upon recent evidence. It explores how girls, as a means of coping with negative emotions, often resort to drug use, while boys primarily initiate drug use due to peer pressure or sensation-seeking tendencies. Women, frequently having endured traumatic life events, may turn to MDMA as a form of self-medication. Notably, women face an elevated risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections due to their altered mental states and diminished condom use during MDMA consumption. Additionally, females exhibit heightened sensitivity to the subjective effects of MDMA, consistently reporting heightened anxiety, adverse effects, and negative side effects. While women may have a higher susceptibility to hyponatremia, intriguingly, they appear to be less vulnerable to MDMA-induced hyperthermia. Although limited, available data suggest that prenatal MDMA exposure could lead to motor delays in infants, necessitating further research to unravel the potential cognitive effects. Furthermore, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy holds immense promise for addressing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among female subgroups. These pronounced gender and sex disparities in MDMA use and its effects underscore the pressing need for additional research to develop tailored, effective, and safe treatment approaches that account for these fundamental factors.",

MDMA increases positive responses to social images, and it has been suggested that the ability of MDMA to positively bias social perception may underlie its therapeutic efficacy as a psychotherapy adjunct. However, the effect of the compound on affective responses to positive or negative social feedback has not been tested. AIMS: In this study, we aimed to test the effects of MDMA compared to placebo and the prototypical stimulant, methamphetamine (MA), on responses to positive and negative social feedback. METHODS: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (NCT03790618), comparing the effects of two doses of MDMA (0.75 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg) to both placebo and MA (20 mg) on responses to a personalized social feedback task, similar to a dating app, in healthy adult volunteers ages 18-40 (N = 36, 18 women, 18 men). RESULTS/OUTCOMES: The high dose of MDMA increased positive affective responses to social feedback. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: These findings suggest one process by which MDMA may facilitate social connection. Further work is needed to understand how MDMA affects responses to more generalized types of social feedback and to understand these effects in clinical populations.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is a resurgence of interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Primary findings from our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site Phase 3 clinical trial of participants with severe PTSD (NCT03537014) showed that MDMA-assisted therapy induced significant attenuation in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 compared to Therapy with placebo. Deficits in emotional coping skills and altered self-capacities constitute major obstacles to successful completion of available treatments. The current analysis evaluated the differential effects of MDMA-assisted therapy and Therapy with placebo on 3 transdiagnostic outcome measures and explored the contribution of changes in self-experience to improvement in PTSD scores. METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive manualized therapy with either MDMA or placebo during 3 experimental sessions in combination with 3 preparation and 9 integration therapy visits. Symptoms were measured at baseline and 2 months after the last experimental session using the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the 26-item Self Compassion Scale (SCS), and the 63-item Inventory of Altered Self-Capacities (IASC). RESULTS: 90 participants were randomized and dosed (MDMA-assisted therapy, n = 46; Therapy with placebo, n = 44); 84.4% (76/90) had histories of developmental trauma, and 87.8% (79/90) had suffered multiple traumas. MDMA-assisted therapy facilitated statistically significant greater improvement on the TAS-20, the SCS, and most IASC factors of interpersonal conflicts; idealization disillusionment; abandonment concerns; identity impairment; self-awareness; susceptibility to influence; affect dysregulation; affect instability; affect skill deficit; tension reduction activities; the only exception was identity diffusion. CONCLUSION: Compared with Therapy with placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy had significant positive effects on transdiagnostic mental processes of self-experience which are often associated with poor treatment outcome. This provides a possible window into understanding the psychological capacities facilitated by psychedelic agents that may result in significant improvements in PTSD symptomatology.",

Although therapeutic alliance has been established as a key predictor across psychotherapies and is emphasised within MDMA-AP treatment manuals, research has not yet examined the relationship between therapeutic alliance and MDMA-AP treatment outcomes.Objective: Examine whether therapeutic alliance predicts changes in PTSD symptoms following MDMA-AP.Method: Twenty-three individuals with chronic PTSD participated in a MDMA-AP clinical trial that included a randomised (MDMA vs. placebo) and open-label phase. The present analyses focused on participants who were administered MDMA over the course of the randomised and open-label phases (n = 22). Therapeutic alliance was assessed using the Working Alliance Inventory at sessions baseline (pre-session 3) and sessions 4 and 9. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised.Results: Controlling for baseline clinician-assessed PTSD severity, therapeutic alliance at sessions 4 and 9 (but not baseline) significantly predicted post-MDMA-AP clinician-assessed PTSD severity. Controlling for baseline self-reported PTSD severity, therapeutic alliance at baseline (although this did not survive correction for multiple comparisons) and sessions 4 and 9 predicted post-MDMA-AP self-reported PTSD severity.Conclusions: The present results provide the first preliminary evidence for the relationship between the therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes within MDMA-AP for PTSD. These findings highlight the important role of psychotherapy, and common psychotherapeutic factors, within MDMA-AP. Replication in studies with larger and more diverse clinical samples remain necessary.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00090064.",

In this article, we review clinical trials and research on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in PTSD patients, its pharmacokinetics, and current treatment guidelines for PTSD. Our findings are based on the results of the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy from six phase II randomized controlled trials. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD has received the \"breakthrough therapy\" designation from the FDA. MDMA can reduce PTSD symptoms even in treatment-resistant cases by increasing certain neurohormones, i.e., dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and oxytocin. It also modulates activities in the brain regions involved in fear and anxiety. Future research is needed to show whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and whether its use can be integrated into available treatment options for PTSD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sexual health, an integral component of overall well-being, is frequently compromised by common yet underdiagnosed sexual dysfunctions. Traditional interventions encompass pharmaceutical and psychological treatments. Unconventional therapies, like MDMA, offer hope for sexual dysfunction. This review delves into MDMA's effects on sexual responsiveness and its potential role in treating sexual dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to elucidate effects of MDMA on different domains of the female and male sexual response cycles. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on the effects of MDMA on each domain of the female and male sexual response cycles. PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were queried, and results were screened using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Search terms utilized were \"MDMA\" or \"ecstasy\" in combination with \"desire,\" \"arousal,\" \"lubrication,\" \"orgasm,\" \"pleasure,\" \"libido,\" \"erection,\" and \"ejaculation.\" Inclusion criteria for this review were MDMA use by study subjects and sexual outcomes in at least 1 domain of the female and/or male sexual response cycles were described and measured. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies (both prospective and retrospective), surveys, and literature reviews published between January 2000 and June 2022 were included. Case reports and studies that did not address conditions of interest were excluded from analysis. Duplicated search results were screened out. The remaining studies were then read in full text to ensure they met inclusion and exclusion criteria for analysis. RESULTS: We identified 181 studies, of which 6 met criteria for assessment of the female sexual response cycle and 8 met criteria for assessment of the male sexual response cycle. Four of 6 studies reported increased sexual desire with MDMA use among women. Arousal and lubrication were improved with MDMA use in 3 of 4 studies, but they were not affected in 1 randomized control study. In men, 7 studies evaluated the effects of MDMA on desire and/or arousal, 5 studies measured impact on erection, 3 on orgasm, and 2 on ejaculation. Sixty percent of interview-based studies reported increased sexual desire in men, while 40% reported mixed or no effect. Two studies reported impairment of erection, 2 reported mixed effects, and 1 reported fear of erection impairment. In both men and women, all studies evaluating orgasm reported delay in achieving orgasm but increased intensity and pleasure if achieved. Primary outcome measures were variable and largely qualitative. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MDMA generally increases sexual desire and intensifies orgasm when achieved. While producing conflicting evidence on sexual arousal in both sexes, MDMA may impair erectile and ejaculatory function in men.",

PTSD is also common among trauma-exposed adolescents, and current treatments leave much room for improvement. We present a rationale for considering MDMA-AP for treating PTSD among adolescents. Evidence suggests that as an adjunct to therapy, MDMA may reduce avoidance and enable trauma processing, strengthen therapeutic alliance, enhance extinction learning and trauma-related reappraisal, and hold potential beyond PTSD symptoms. Drawing on existing trauma-focused treatments, we suggest possible adaptations to MDMA-AP for use with adolescents, focusing on (1) reinforcing motivation, (2) the development of a strong therapeutic alliance, (3) additional emotion and behavior management techniques, (4) more directive exposure-based methods during MDMA sessions, (5) more support for concomitant challenges and integrating treatment benefits, and (6) involving family in treatment. We then discuss potential risks particular to adolescents, including physical and psychological side effects, toxicity, misuse potential, and ethical issues. We argue that MDMA-AP holds potential for adolescents suffering from PTSD. Instead of off-label use or extrapolating from adult studies, clinical trials should be carried out to determine whether MDMA-AP is safe and effective for PTSD among adolescents.",

However, little is known about the current epidemiology of recreational ecstasy/MDMA use. METHODS: We estimated past-year prevalence and correlates of ecstasy/MDMA use based on a representative sample of noninstitutionalized US individuals 12 years or older from the 2015-2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 315,661). RESULTS: An estimated 0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9-1.0) of individuals used ecstasy/MDMA in the past year. Compared with those ages 35-49 years, all younger age groups were at increased odds for use, while those older than 50 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.08-0.23) were at low odds for use. Compared with heterosexual men, those identifying as bisexual women (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.02-1.72) were at increased odds for use, and compared with White individuals, those identifying as Asian (aOR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.42-2.59), Black (aOR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.41-2.06), or multiracial (aOR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.19-2.16) were at increased odds for use. Past-year use of other drugs (e.g., cannabis, ketamine), prescription drug misuse (e.g., pain relievers, stimulants), nicotine dependence (aOR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.00-1.45), and alcohol use disorder (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.25-1.58) were also associated with increased odds for use. CONCLUSIONS: While use of ecstasy/MDMA continues to be relatively rare, findings from this study can help inform prevention and harm reduction strategies, especially among certain subpopulations that are at high risk for use.",

Changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total severity score (primary endpoint) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) functional impairment score (key secondary endpoint) were assessed by blinded independent assessors. Participants were randomized to MDMA-AT (n = 53) or placebo with therapy (n = 51). Overall, 26.9% (28/104) of participants had moderate PTSD, and 73.1% (76/104) of participants had severe PTSD. Participants were ethnoracially diverse: 28 of 104 (26.9%) identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 35 of 104 (33.7%) identified as other than White. Least squares (LS) mean change in CAPS-5 score (95% confidence interval (CI)) was -23.7 (-26.94, -20.44) for MDMA-AT versus -14.8 (-18.28, -11.28) for placebo with therapy (P < 0.001, d = 0.7). LS mean change in SDS score (95% CI) was -3.3 (-4.03, -2.60) for MDMA-AT versus -2.1 (-2.89, -1.33) for placebo with therapy (P = 0.03, d = 0.4). Seven participants had a severe treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) (MDMA-AT, n = 5 (9.4%); placebo with therapy, n = 2 (3.9%)). There were no deaths or serious TEAEs. These data suggest that MDMA-AT reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in a diverse population with moderate to severe PTSD and was generally well tolerated.

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a range of neurodevelopmental syndromes diagnostically characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction and repetitive, inflexible patterns of behaviors, interests, and thoughts. ASD affects people worldwide, irrespective of race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status, with debilitating effects on employment and interpersonal relationships. Though the atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole and risperidone are approved to treat irritability associated with ASD, these drugs may elicit treatment-limiting adverse effects, such as suicidal ideation, sedation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, dizziness, and weight gain. However, there are no approved pharmacotherapeutics for global symptoms of ASD, and better treatments are needed. Drugs with pro-social effects, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its analogues, may be beneficial here, as social anxiety and social avoidance are major complications of ASD that adversely impact the quality of life for sufferers and caregivers. This review describes the complex pharmacology of methylenedioxy amphetamine analogues (hereafter referred to as MDXX drugs), focusing on MDMA and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methyl-α-ethylphenylethylamine (MBDB) and how they may help treat ASD. Specifically, we address the roles of various drug-binding sites, metabolic enzymes, and chemical structure-activity relationships that mediate these substances' pharmacological and toxicological effects. Throughout the review, we emphasize the distinct profiles of individual stereoisomers of the MDXX drugs and how combining these enantiomers as racemic mixtures may explain the complexity of drug effects on behavior and physiology. We propose that the MDXX drugs represent a fruitful chemical space for developing clinically effective and relatively safer molecules and formulations for treating ASD."

Clinical trials have shown promising safety and efficacy, but the mechanisms underlying this treatment form remain largely unestablished. This article explores recent preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that the treatment's efficacy may be influenced by the mnemonic effects of MDMA. We review data on the effects of MDMA on fear extinction and fear reconsolidation and the utility of these processes for PTSD treatment. We corroborate our findings by incorporating research from cognitive psychology and psychopharmacology and offer recommendations for future research."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a serious and prevalent psychiatric condition that heavily impacts social functioning and quality of life. Though efficacious treatments exist for SAD, remission rates remain elevated and a significant portion of those affected do not access effective treatment, suggesting the need for additional evidence-based treatment options. This paper presents a protocol for an open-label pilot study of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for social anxiety disorder. The study aims to assess preliminary treatment outcomes, feasibility and safety, and psychological and physiological processes of change in the treatment of SAD with MDMA-AT. A secondary aim includes the development of a treatment manual for MDMA-AT for SAD. METHOD: The outlined protocol is a randomized, open-label delayed treatment study. We will recruit 20 participants who meet criteria with moderate-to-severe social anxiety disorder (SAD) of the generalized subtype. Participants will be randomly assigned to an immediate treatment (n = 10) or delayed treatment condition (n = 10). Those in the immediate treatment condition will proceed immediately to active MDMA-AT consisting of three preparation sessions, two medicine sessions in which they receive oral doses of MDMA, and six integration sessions over approximately a 16-week period. The delayed treatment condition will receive the same intervention after a 16-week delay. Our primary outcome is SAD symptom reduction as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale administered by blinded raters at post-treatment and 6 month follow up. Secondary outcomes include changes in functional impairment, feasibility and safety measures, and novel therapeutic processes of change including shame and shame-related coping, belongingness, self-concealment, and self-compassion at post-treatment. Exploratory outcomes are also discussed. DISCUSSION: The results of this pilot trial advance the field's understanding of the acceptability and potential effectiveness of MDMA-AT for social anxiety disorder and provide an overview of relevant therapeutic mechanisms unique to SAD. We hope findings from this protocol will inform the design of subsequent larger-scale randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the efficacy of MDMA-AT for SAD.

However, few qualitative studies have been conducted to investigate patients' experiences who participate in these trials. This study intends to complement and clarify the quantitative findings resulting from a Phase-II clinical trial for assessing the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD by using a qualitative approach based on available material of 4 recorded and transcripted integrative sessions per participant. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was conducted for 7 participants who met criteria for severe PTSD to develop a deeper understanding of the treatment and its efficacy. Analysis results provided real-life statements from participants that reflect perceived mechanisms of change and showed to what extent their proposed working mechanisms integrate into daily life."

Two medications, paroxetine hydrochloride and sertraline hydrochloride, are approved treatments for PTSD by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Analyses of pharmacotherapies for PTSD found only small to moderate effects when compared with placebo. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) obtained Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the FDA for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD on the basis of pooled analyses showing a large effect size for this treatment. This review covers data supporting BTD. In this treatment, MDMA is administered with psychotherapy in up to three monthly 8-h sessions. Participants are prepared for these sessions beforehand, and process material arising from the sessions in follow-up integrative psychotherapy sessions. Comparing data used for the approval of paroxetine and sertraline and pooled data from Phase 2 studies, MAPS demonstrated that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy constitutes a substantial improvement over available pharmacotherapies in terms of safety and efficacy. Studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy had lower dropout rates compared to sertraline and paroxetine trials. As MDMA is only administered under direct observation during a limited number of sessions, there is little chance of diversion, accidental or intentional overdose, or withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation. BTD status has expedited the development of MAPS phase 3 trials occurring worldwide, leading up to a planned submission seeking FDA approval in 2021.

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presents a major public health problem for which currently available treatments are modestly effective. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was -24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and -13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation. Appeared originally in Nat Med 2021; 27:1025-1033."

Within the next few years MDMA-assisted therapy is projected for approval by regulatory authorities. MDMA's primary mechanism of action includes modulation of monoamine signaling by increasing release and inhibiting reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. This pharmacology affects sympathomimetic physiology. In controlled trials, special attention has been given to cardiovascular adverse events (AEs), because transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure have been observed during the MDMA-assisted therapy sessions. Finding and quantifying the potential drivers of cardiac AEs in clinical trials is difficult since only a relatively small number of participants have been included in these studies, and a limited set of allowed concomitant drugs has been studied. In this study a more diverse set of reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was surveyed. We found 17 cases of cardiovascular AEs, in which the individuals had taken one or more substances in addition to MDMA. Interestingly, all of those concomitant medications and illicit substances, including opioids, stimulants, anticholinergics, and amphetamines, had been previously associated with cardiovascular AEs. Furthermore, in none of the reports MDMA was marked as the primary suspect."

      "abstract": "There is renewed interest in the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and practice. Although acute subjective effects of LSD are mostly positive, negative subjective effects, including anxiety, may occur. The induction of overall positive acute subjective effects is desired in psychedelic-assisted therapy because positive acute experiences are associated with greater therapeutic long-term benefits. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces marked positive subjective effects and is used recreationally with LSD, known as \"candyflipping.\" The present study investigated whether the co-administration of MDMA can be used to augment acute subjective effects of LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design with 24 healthy subjects (12 women, 12 men) to compare the co-administration of MDMA (100 mg) and LSD (100 µg) with MDMA and LSD administration alone and placebo. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and endocrine effects and pharmacokinetics. MDMA co-administration with LSD did not change the quality of acute subjective effects compared with LSD alone. However, acute subjective effects lasted longer after LSD + MDMA co-administration compared with LSD and MDMA alone, consistent with higher plasma concentrations of LSD (Cmax and area under the curve) and a longer plasma elimination half-life of LSD when MDMA was co-administered. The LSD + MDMA combination increased blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil size more than LSD alone. Both MDMA alone and the LSD + MDMA combination increased oxytocin levels more than LSD alone. Overall, the co-administration of MDMA (100 mg) did not improve acute effects or the safety profile of LSD (100 µg). The combined use of MDMA and LSD is unlikely to provide relevant benefits over LSD alone in psychedelic-assisted therapy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04516902.",

      "abstract": "The use of illicit substances continues to pose a substantial threat to global health, affecting millions of individuals annually. Evidence suggests the existence of a 'brain-gut axis' as the involving connection between the central nervous system and gut microbiome (GM). Dysbiosis of the GM has been associated with the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases, including metabolic, malignant, and inflammatory conditions. However, little is currently known about the involvement of this axis in modulating the GM in response to psychoactive substances. In this study, we investigated the effect of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, \"Ecstasy\")-dependence on the behavioral and biochemical responses, and the diversity and abundance of the gut microbiome in rats post-treated (or not) with aqueous extract of Anacyclus pyrethrum (AEAP), which has been reported to exhibit anticonvulsant activity. The dependency was validated using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, behavioral, and biochemical tests, while the gut microbiota was identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The CPP and behavioral tests confirmed the presence of MDMA withdrawal syndrome. Interestingly, treatment with AEAP led to a compositional shift in the GM compared to the MDMA-treated rats. Specifically, the AEAP group yielded a higher relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacter, while animals receiving MDMA had higher levels of E. coli. These findings suggest that A. pyrethrum therapy may directly modulate the gut microbiome, highlighting a potential target for regulating and treating substance use disorders.",

      "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder with limited treatment options that are associated with large heterogeneity in treatment response and high rates of dropout. New or complementary treatments for borderline personality disorder are needed that may be able to bolster treatment outcomes. In this review, the authors comment on the plausibility for research on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) used in conjunction with psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder (i.e., MDMA-assisted psychotherapy [MDMA-AP]). On the basis of the promise of MDMA-AP in treating disorders overlapping with borderline personality disorder (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder), the authors speculate on initial treatment targets and hypothesized mechanisms of change that are grounded in prior literature and theory. Initial considerations for designing MDMA-AP clinical trials to investigate the safety, feasibility, and preliminary effects of MDMA-AP for borderline personality disorder are also presented."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Disruptions of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis can cause an arginine vasopressin deficiency, also known as central diabetes insipidus. Patients with this condition are at high risk of additional oxytocin deficiency owing to the close anatomical proximity of oxytocin-producing neurons; however, no conclusive evidence for such a deficiency has been reported. We aimed to use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as ecstasy), a strong activator of the central oxytocinergic system, as a biochemical and psychoactive provocation test to investigate oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus). METHODS: This single-centre, case-control study with nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial included patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and healthy controls (matched 1:1 by age, sex, and BMI) and was conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. We used block randomisation to assign participants to receive either a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in the first experimental session; patients received the opposite treatment at the next session, with a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks between the two sessions. Participants and investigators assessing the outcomes were masked to assignment. Oxytocin concentrations were measured at 0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 300 min after MDMA or placebo. The primary outcome was the area under the plasma oxytocin concentration curve (AUC) after drug intake. The AUC was compared between groups and conditions using a linear mixed-effects model. Subjective drug effects were assessed throughout the study using ten-point visual analogue scales. Acute adverse effects were assessed before and 360 min after drug intake using a 66-item list of complaints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04648137. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2021, and May 1, 2022, we recruited 15 patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and 15 healthy controls. All participants completed the study and were included in the analyses. In healthy controls, median plasma oxytocin concentration was 77 pg/mL (IQR 59-94) at baseline and increased by 659 pg/mL (355-914) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 102 095 pg/mL (41 782-129 565); in patients, baseline oxytocin concentration was 60 pg/mL (51-74) and only slightly increased by 66 pg/mL (16-94) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 6446 pg/mL (1291-11 577). The effect of MDMA on oxytocin was significantly different between groups: the AUC for oxytocin was 82% (95% CI 70-186) higher in healthy controls than in patients (difference 85 678 pg/mL [95% CI 63 356-108 000], p<0·0001). The increase in oxytocin in healthy controls was associated with typical strong subjective prosocial, empathic, and anxiolytic effects, whereas only minimal subjective effects were observed in patients, in agreement with the lack of increase in oxytocin concentrations. The most frequently reported adverse effects were fatigue (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of appetite (ten [67%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of concentration (eight [53%] healthy controls and seven [47%] patients), and dry mouth (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients). In addition, two (13%) healthy controls and four (27%) patients developed transient mild hypokalaemia. INTERPRETATION: These findings are highly suggestive of clinically meaningful oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus), laying the groundwork for a new hypothalamic-pituitary disease entity.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol and other substance use disorders are commonly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the presence of these comorbidities is associated with worse treatment outcomes. Additionally, disparities in substance and PTSD prevalence have been associated with minority races and ethnicities, and minorities have been shown to be less likely to engage in treatment. Psychedelic-assisted treatments, including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), have shown preliminary trans-diagnostic effectiveness, however it is unknown how individuals with substance use disorders view the therapeutic potential of MDMA therapy. Previous studies have also shown that minority races and ethnicities are under-represented in the MDMA trials, leading to concerns about inequitable access to clinical treatment. METHODS: To explore demographic characteristics related to patient-level perspectives on the therapeutic potential of MDMA-assisted therapy, this study describes data from a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of 918 individuals self-reporting criteria consistent with alcohol or substance use disorders. RESULTS: Overall, a majority of individuals reported support for medical research of MDMA (68.1%), belief that MDMA-assisted therapy might be a useful treatment (70.1%), and willingness to try MDMA-assisted therapy if it were determined to be an appropriate treatment for them (58.8%). No race or ethnicity differences were found in support for further research or belief in effectiveness, however there were small disparities in terms of willingness to try MDMA-assisted therapy and concerns related to use of this treatment approach. CONCLUSION: These results provide insights and future directions as the field of psychedelic-assisted therapy seeks to provide equitable access to clinical care and to diversify research participation."

Clinical studies are currently being conducted around the world on the use of this substance in the treatment of PTSD and alcoholism. However, little demographic information is available on users who use the substance for recreational purposes. The aim was to determine basic demographic and helath characteristics with validated tools. METHODS: The authors prepared an original questionnaire on the demography of MDMA users and combined it with the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The survey was sent to Polish MDMA users via the Internet. RESULTS: 304 responses were received from people over 18 years of age. MDMA is widespread among young adults, in many different places of residence and regardless of gender. The users take MDMA in both pill and crystal form and very rarely test drugs bought from a dealer. Most users feel that MDMA has had a good impact on their lives. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA is rarely used as the only psychoactive substance. MDMA users rate their health higher than people using other psychoactive substances.",

Despite recommended various therapeutic approaches, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, treatment is not as effective as expected. Over recent years the pharmaceutical industry has not been able to offer a new approach, founded on multiple mechanisms of action. That is why a part of researchers focused on psychoactive substances synthesized years ago and then banned. These days MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD clinical trials are conducted, and due to previous results, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a breakthrough therapy designation. In this article, we present the mechanism of actions, the therapeutic rationale, applied psychotherapeutic methods, and potential dangers. If ongoing phase 3 studies are completed and clinical efficacy criteria are achieved, the FDA could approve the treatment as early as 2022.",

Several studies have accrued indicating that the recreational amphetamine-related drug (+/-)- 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; Ecstasy) targets the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in mice, inducing neurodegeneration and gliosis, causing acute hyperthermia and cognitive impairment. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a standardized extract of W. somnifera (WSE) on MDMA-induced neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, memory impairment and hyperthermia. Mice received a 3-day pretreatment with vehicle or WSE. Thereafter, vehicle- and WSE-pretreated mice were randomly divided into four groups: saline, WSE, MDMA alone, WSE plus MDMA. Body temperature was recorded throughout treatment, and memory performance was assessed by a novel object recognition (NOR) task at the end of treatment. Thereafter, immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as marker of dopaminergic degeneration, and of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and TMEM119, as markers of astrogliosis or microgliosis, respectively. MDMA-treated mice showed a decrease in TH-positive neurons and fibers in the SNc and striatum respectively, an increase in gliosis and body temperature, and a decrease in NOR performance, irrespective of vehicle or WSE pretreatment. Acute WSE plus MDMA counteracted the modifications in TH-positive cells in SNc, GFAP-positive cells in striatum, TMEM in both areas and NOR performance, as compared to MDMA alone, while no differences were observed as compared to saline. Results indicate that WSE acutely administered in combination with MDMA, but not as pretreatment, protects mice against the noxious central effects of MDMA.",

      "abstract": "The increased use of the stimulant drug, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), more commonly known as Ecstasy, Molly or X, has been linked to the development of life-threatening hyperthermia in human and animal models. The current study aimed to investigate the role of the gut-adrenal axis in MDMA-induced hyperthermia by assessing the influence of the acute exogenous supplementation with norepinephrine (NE) or corticosterone (CORT) to adrenalectomized (ADX) rats following MDMA administration. MDMA (10 mg/kg, sc) resulted in significant increase of body temperature in SHAM animals compared to ADX animals at 30-, 60- and 90-min timepoints post-MDMA treatment. The attenuated MDMA-mediated hyperthermic response seen in ADX animals was partially restored by the exogenous administration of NE (3 mg/kg, ip) or CORT (3 mg/kg, ip) 30 min after MDMA treatment. Additionally, 16 S rRNA analysis revealed distinct changes in the gut microbiome composition and diversity notable by the higher abundance of minor phyla Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria in ADX rats compared to control and SHAM rats. Furthermore, MDMA administration resulted in marked changes in the dominant phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and minor phyla Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria in ADX animals. The most notable changes in the gut microbiome upon CORT treatment were reported with increase in Bacteroidetes and decrease in Firmicutes phyla whereas NE treatment resulted in increase in Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria post treatment. These results suggest a correlation between the sympathoadrenal axis, gut microbiome structure and diversity and MDMA-mediated hyperthermia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous research has demonstrated that epigenetic changes in specific hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) genes may predict successful psychotherapy in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent Phase 3 clinical trial reported high efficacy of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for treating patients with severe PTSD compared to a therapy with placebo group (NCT03537014). This raises important questions regarding potential mechanisms of MDMA-assisted therapy. In the present study, we examined epigenetic changes in three key HPA axis genes before and after MDMA and placebo with therapy. As a pilot sub-study to the parent clinical trial, we assessed potential HPA epigenetic predictors for treatment response with genomic DNA derived from saliva (MDMA, n = 16; placebo, n = 7). Methylation levels at all 259 CpG sites annotated to three HPA genes (CRHR1, FKBP5, and NR3C1) were assessed in relation to treatment response as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5; Total Severity Score). Second, group (MDMA vs. placebo) differences in methylation change were assessed for sites that predicted treatment response. RESULTS: Methylation change across groups significantly predicted symptom reduction on 37 of 259 CpG sites tested, with two sites surviving false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Further, the MDMA-treatment group showed more methylation change compared to placebo on one site of the NR3C1 gene. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that therapy-related PTSD symptom improvements may be related to DNA methylation changes in HPA genes and such changes may be greater in those receiving MDMA-assisted therapy. These findings can be used to generate hypothesis driven analyses for future studies with larger cohorts."
