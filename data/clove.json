      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several alternative feed additives to replace AGP to maintain good quail performance include the use of probiotics and herbal extracts. AIM: In this study, the researchers want to find out the best dosage of microbiota inoculum as probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus plantarum), single garlic extract (Allium Sativum L), and combination groups to improve laying quail egg production, hematology profile (erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes, and platelets), and reproductive organs in terms of length and weight and have better egg quality on the internal (Haugh units, yolk score, albumin index, yolk index) and external (shell thickness, egg weight) while laying phase of laying quail. METHODS: A total of 100 4-week-old laying quails of uniform body weight were randomly distributed into five treatments with four replicates each and five quails in each replicate. There were 5 treatment groups: T0 quails were given basal feed; T1 quails were given basal feed and drinking water added with probiotics at a dose of 4 ml/l; T2 quails were given feed added with a single garlic extract at a dose of 2 ml/g and ordinary drinking water; T3 quails were given feed with a single garlic extract at a dose of 2 ml/g and drinking water supplemented with probiotics at a dose of 4 ml/l; and T4 quails were given a single garlic extract at a dose of 1 ml/g and drinking water supplemented with probiotics at a dose of 2 ml/l. The study investigated the effects of microbiota inoculum, including probiotics, garlic extract, and a control group, on reproductive organ morphologies in chickens. Results showed significant improvements in weight vagina, uterus, oviduct, ovarium, weight cloaca, growth performance, body weight, egg production, internal egg quality, yolk color score, yolk index, albumin index, external egg quality, Haugh unit, egg height, shape index, egg cell weight, and egg cell thickness. RESULTS: The number of erythrocytes was significantly higher in the chickens treated with the microbiota inoculum compared to the control group. Hemoglobin levels were not significant in all treatments, but hematocrit levels were significant in the chickens treated with the microbiota inoculum. Leukocytes were also significantly higher in the chickens treated with the microbiota inoculum compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The use of a combination of microbiota inoculum in drinking water and garlic extract in feed has been proven to be effective in reducing feed consumption, maintaining hematology, increasing reproductive organs, and boosting the number of laying quail productions, thereby reducing feed conversion ratio.",

      "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of a botanical-derived feed additive containing capsicum oleoresin, clove and garlic essential oils (CCG; Fytera Start, Selko, Indianapolis, IN) in nursery pigs fed with or without pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. In Exp. 1756 pigs (Duroc × Landrace/Large White composite (Smithfield Premium Genetics), initially 7.8 ± 0.09 kg) were used in a 40-d study to determine the effects of CCG level on growth performance of nursery pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. In Exp. 2340 barrows (DNA 200 × 400, initially 6.1 ± 0.08 kg) were used in 38-d study to determine the effect of CCG in diets with or without pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu on growth performance and fecal dry matter (DM). For both experiments, pigs were randomly allotted to pens which were allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design. There were 9 pigs per pen and 21 pens per treatment in Exp. 1 and 5 pigs per pen and 17 pens per treatment in Exp. 2. Dietary treatments in Exp. 1 were corn-soybean meal based with pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu and included either 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of CCG. Dietary treatments in Exp. 2 were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with main effects of CCG (none or 100 mg/kg) and nutritional or pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. All Exp. 2 diets contained 110 mg/kg of Zn and 16.5 mg/kg of Cu from the trace mineral premix. For both experiments, pharmacological levels of Zn were added at 3,000 and 2,000 mg/kg in phase 1 and 2, respectively and Cu was added at 250 mg/kg in all phases. For Exp. 1, overall average daily gain (ADG) increased (linear, P < 0.05) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) tended to increase (linear, P < 0.10) as CCG increased from 0 to 100 mg/kg. For Exp. 2, there was a CCG × Zn/Cu interaction observed for overall ADG and ADFI (P < 0.05) where CCG numerically increased ADG and ADFI in pigs fed nutritional levels of Zn and Cu; but reduced ADG and ADFI in pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. There was a Zn/Cu × day interaction (P = 0.001) for fecal DM, in which there was no difference (P > 0.10) in fecal DM on d 10, but pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu had lower (P < 0.001) fecal DM on d 21 compared to pigs fed nutritional levels of Zn and Cu. In summary, when included in diets with pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu, feeding increasing levels of CCG increased ADG in Exp. 1 but did not improve performance in Exp 2."

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of clove and lavender aromatherapy in reducing headaches caused by spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing urological surgery. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial study involved 90 patients undergoing urological surgery at Bahonar Hospital in Kerman in 2021. Participants were selected using a convenience sampling method and randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received aromatherapy with clove and lavender essential oils, while the control group received standard care. The effectiveness of aromatherapy in reducing post-operative headaches was measured using the Visual Analog Scale. Data analysis was performed using SPSS25. RESULTS: The study found that, while both lavender and clove aromatherapy reduced headache severity compared to the control group at 8 and 24 h post-surgery, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). However, a significant reduction in headache severity was observed in all three groups, with lavender and clove groups showing a greater reduction than the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Aromatherapy could be a simple, affordable, and safe way to reduce pain and the need for post-surgical sedatives. Due to conflicting results in previous studies, further research is necessary to confirm its effectiveness. UNLABELLED: Trial Registration: IRCT20211124053172N1."

However, developing sustainable and cost-effective therapeutic materials remains challenging. This study investigates the osteogenic potential of clove-derived carbon dots (C-CDs) for bone regeneration applications. Methods: C-CDs were synthesized using a green hydrothermal method. The osteogenic potential was evaluated in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) and validated using ectopic bone formation and calvarial defect models. Results: C-CDs demonstrated uniform morphology (~10 nm) with efficient cellular uptake. In vitro studies showed successful osteogenic differentiation through the upregulation of RUNX2, ALP, COL1A1, and BMP-2 mediated by Wnt/β-catenin/GSK3β and BMP signaling pathways. In vivo models have also demonstrated that C-CDs are effective in promoting bone regeneration. Conclusions: These findings establish C-CDs as promising candidates for bone regeneration therapy, offering a sustainable alternative to current treatments. While optimization is needed, their demonstrated osteogenic properties warrant further development for regenerative medicine applications."

      "abstract": "In recent years, Candida albicans has emerged as a significant opportunistic pathogen, causing various infections, particularly in immunocompromised geriatric individuals. One of the major hindrances in managing Candida infections lies in its potential to develop and survive in biofilms, which demonstrate resistance to conventional antifungal therapies, thereby complicating treatment strategies. While clove oil has shown promising results as a potential antifungal agent, its specific anti-biofilm effects against Candida albicans biofilms remain relatively underexplored. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive review to evaluate the existing literature on the anti-biofilm properties of clove oil and its mechanisms of action against Candida albicans biofilms. Such a review will provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic applications of clove oil in combating biofilm-associated Candida infections. This review will enable us to infer and understand the potential effects of clove oil against Candida albicans. This systematic review aims to determine the anti-biofilm efficacy of clove oil against Candida albicans. This systematic review was registered in 'PROSPERO' (CRD42024524134) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The literature searches used Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct databases. All original studies published in English from 2004 to 2023 were included. From 37 studies found online, only four were reviewed. Results showed that clove oil had significant anti-biofilm activity when assessed against Candida albicans. Our systematic review provides insights into clove oil's potential as a therapeutic agent against Candida albicans biofilms. Clove oil also represents a promising avenue for future research and development in managing Candida biofilms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental anxiety about injections are common challenge in pediatric dentistry, often leading to delayed dental treatment. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the anesthetic effectiveness of three different topical agents in pediatric dental procedures. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional in vivo study carried out in the department of pediatric and preventive dentistry. Ninety children were chosen using convenience sampling and divided into three groups based on the topical anesthetic agent administered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The procedure included anxiety assessment using the Modified Venham Picture Scale (MVPS) before and after the procedure, and pain perception was measured with the visual analog scale (VAS) and sound, eye, and motor scale (SEMS). Group A received 2% lidocaine gel, group B experienced precooling of the injection site with an ice cone, and group C was treated with clove oil, followed by a 0.9 mL infiltration injection of 2% lidocaine with 1:1,00,000 epinephrine using a 30-gauge needle for all groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Variations in scores of the MVPS, VAS, and SEMS within and between the three groups were examined with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Spearman's correlation was employed to assess the relationships between the three scales with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Clove oil demonstrated the best anesthetic properties and exhibited the least pain perception among all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Natural options like clove oil and precooling with ice cones may serve as cost-effective alternatives to lidocaine gel in reducing pain and anxiety during pediatric dental procedures.

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Hazardous heavy metals, particularly cadmium (Cd), are widely distributed in the environment and cause oxidative stress in various animal and human organs. Clove oil (CLO), a common aromatic spice, has been used as a traditional medication as it has potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective properties. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects of clove oil (CLO) against hepatorenal toxicity induced by cadmium (Cd). METHODS: Twenty rats were equally divided into four groups: a control group, a Cd group treated with 15 mg/kg b.wt CdCl2, a CLO group administered 200 mg/kg b.wt CLO, and a Cd+CLO group. All groups were orally treated for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Cadmium (Cd) exposure caused anemia and hepatorenal damage, as evidenced by increased serum levels of urea, creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin (including its direct and indirect fractions), and elevated activities of liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). However, total protein and albumin levels decreased. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the levels of glutathione, glutathione transferase, and catalase in the liver antioxidant profiles. Meanwhile, malondialdehyde levels increased. Cadmium toxicity caused elevated expression of liver apoptosis markers, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and caspase-3, and inflammation. CLO ameliorated the oxidative effects of Cd through decreasing urea (27.4%), creatinine (41.6%), liver enzymes, and hepatic apoptotic markers while increasing levels of total protein, albumin, and hepatic values of SOD (60.37%), CAT (64.49%), GSH (50.41%), and GST (9.16%). CONCLUSIONS: Hematological and biochemical parameters, as well as the antioxidant system, improved following clove oil treatment, leading to a reduction in hepatorenal damage. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that CLO protects rats from inflammation, apoptosis, and hepatorenal oxidative damage caused by Cd poisoning. Comprehensive translational research is required to validate CLO's efficacy and safety of use in humans. Future studies should focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms, optimal dosing strategies, and potential synergistic effects of CLO with other therapeutic agents."

      "abstract": "The aim of our research was to understand the impact of ochratoxin A (OTA) exposure on various physiological and behavioral aspects in adult Wistar rats, and to evaluate the efficacy of a Syzygium aromaticum essential oil (EOC) treatment in restoring the damage caused by this toxin. The essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation, a yield of 12.70% was obtained for EOC, and the GC-MS characterization of this essential oil revealed that its principal major components are eugenol (80.95%), eugenyl acetate (10.48%), β-caryophyllene (7.21%), and α-humulene (0.87%). Acute OTA intoxication was induced by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 289 µg/kg/b.w. every 48 h for 12 doses, resulting in significant reductions in the body and brain weights of exposed rats when compared with controls. The neurobehavioral analysis using several behavioral testing techniques, such as the forced swimming, the dark/light test, the Morris water maze, and the open field test, clearly revealed that OTA exposure causes neurobehavioral disorders, including decreased locomotor activity, a reduced willingness to explore the environment, reflecting a state of stress, anxiety and depression, as well as impaired memory and learning. In addition, OTA intoxication has been associated with metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia and hypercortisolemia. However, treatment with EOC mitigated these adverse effects by improving body and brain weights and restoring neurobehavioral function. The in silico analysis revealed significant affinities between clove oils and two tested esterase enzymes (ACh and BuChE) that were more than or similar to the four neurotransmitters \"dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and glutamic acid\" and the co-crystallized ligands NAG, MES, and GZ5. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of EOC in combating the toxic effects of OTA and pave the way for future research into the mechanisms of action and therapeutic applications of natural compounds in the prevention and treatment of poison-induced diseases."

      "abstract": "Clove oil obtained from Syzygium aromaticum (L.) is traditionally employed to treat inflammation associated with rheumatism, gastric disorders, and as an analgesic. Chemo-herbal combinations are known to have potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, while mitigating the drug related side effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects of a combination of flurbiprofen and clove oil in a micro-emulsion (FCM) form using various in vivo models. Micro-emulsion of flurbiprofen and clove oil (FCM) was prepared following reported protocols and three different dose combinations (25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg) were evaluated in carrageenan and histamine-induced acute inflammation, CFA-induced arthritis, yeast-induced pyrexia, and acetic acid-induced writhing models. qPCR studies were conducted to explore the possible mechanism of action. GC-MS of clove oil was performed to explore its chemical composition. FCM 25 mg/kg treated group exhibited significantly better (p < 0.05) effects compared to clove oil (CM) and flurbiprofen (FBR) (25 mg/kg) treated groups in both acute and chronic models. Histopathological study of joints showed a reduction in infiltration of inflammatory cells, bone erosion, and tissue oedema in FCM (25 mg/kg) treated group as compared to other treatment groups. Significant up-regulation in mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) and down-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes (NF-κB, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and COX-2) was observed in all the FCM-treated groups but, 25 mg/kg-treated group showed comparatively better results. Gross macroscopic examination of stomach sections also showed relatively less deleterious effects of test treatments (CM and FCM) as compared with FBR treated group. Serum levels of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were also found to be normal as compared to FBR and tween-water (TW) treated groups. GC-MS of clove oil revealed that it was rich in eugenol contents.  This study reveals that a combination of flurbiprofen and clove oil in a micro-emulsion form could be a promising approach to enhance therapeutic actions and to mitigate synthetic drugs related side effects in clinical settings. It might implicate a synergistic action on the modulation of inflammatory genes expression. Further research is warranted to explore the full potential of this combination in treating various inflammatory conditions.",

Utilizing components derived from plant origin such as natural oils as a sustainable and eco-friendly approach for managing disease is highly required nowadays. The aim of the current study is to assess the antibacterial and wound-healing activity of clove oil and its novel eco-friendly nanostructured liquid crystals (Eco-friendly-NLCs) formulation in treating infected burn wounds. A 23 full factorial design was used to optimize the Eco-friendly-NLCs. Clove oil and its novel nano-formulation were characterized and subjected to in vitro and in vivo assessments for their efficacy. Twenty rats were used experimentally. The optimum Eco-friendly-NLCs had 189.2 ± 1.9 nm, -22.8 ± 0.7 mV and 0.308 as values for particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index. Transmission electron microscope images showed discrete spherical shape NLCs with no aggregations. The microbiological and pharmacological results revealed a superior efficacy regarding clove loaded Eco-friendly-NLCs in inhibiting bacterial growth (inhibition zone of 38 mm), significantly reducing inflammatory biomarker levels (p < 0.001), promoting angiogenesis and prompt wound healing. The Eco-friendly-NLCs loaded with clove oil could be considered as a promising formulation providing anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and wound healing effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological anxiety and depression, as well as memory impairment, are frequently linked to inflammation. Clove essential oil (CEO) administration and hydrogen (H2) inhalation have been proven to have anti-inflammatory and alleviating effects on related psychological disorders in the past. The current study investigated the potential to improve anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive function by a combination of CEO and H2 treatment. METHODS: The mice were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammation and oxidative stress response and cause psychological disorders. Using this animal model, we conducted experiments to test whether essential oil and H2 inhalation could improve the psychological damage in behavior caused by LPS. Subsequently, elevated plus maze (EPM), forced swimming test (FST), and passive avoidance (PA) test were performed for evaluation of mice anxiety, depression, and response to electric shock, respectively. Furthermore, the biochemical analysis was used to examine the expression levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. RESULTS: Our results showed that CEO administration and H2 inhalation alone or in combination positively improved inflammation-induced anxiety, depression, and cognitive memory deficits in the mice. In the single treatment groups, CEO demonstrated better results than H2 inhalation in the elevated plus maze, forced swimming, and passive avoidance tests, while combined treatment with both provided a further improved enhancement effect. Biochemical analysis of the cerebral cortex revealed that CEO and H2 therapy reversed the LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a combination of CEO and H2 has the potential to treat psychological disorders or neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Neratinib maleate (NM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is used in the treatment of breast cancer. NM is orally administered at a high dose of 290 mg due to its low solubility and poor dissolution rate at pH > 3, as well as gut-wall metabolism limiting its bioavailability. Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDSs) of NM were developed in the current study to improve its oral bioavailability. The oily vehicle (clove oil) was selected based on the solubility of NM, while the surfactant and the cosurfactant were selected based on the turbidimetric analysis. Three different sets were screened for surfactant selection in the preparation of SEDDS formulations, the first set containing Cremophor® EL alone as the surfactant, the second set containing a mixture of Cremophor® EL (surfactant) and Caproyl® PGMC (cosurfactant), and the third set containing a mixture of Cremophor® EL (surfactant) and Capmul® MCM C8 (cosurfactant). Propylene glycol was used as the cosolubilizer in the preparation of SEDDSs. A series of studies, including the construction of ternary phase diagrams to determine the zone of emulsification, thermodynamic stability studies (involving dilution studies, freeze-thaw, and heating-cooling studies), turbidimetric analysis, and physicochemical characterization studies were conducted to identify the two most stable combinations of SEDDSs. The two optimized SEDDS formulations, TP16 and TP25, consisted of clove oil (45% w/w) and propylene glycol (5% w/w) in common but differed with respect to the surfactant or surfactant mixture in the formulations. TP16 was prepared using a mixture of Cremophor® EL (surfactant) and Caproyl® PGMC (cosurfactant) in a 4:1 ratio (50% w/w), while TP25 contained only Cremophor® EL (50% w/w). The mean globule sizes were 239.8 ± 77.8 nm and 204.8 ± 2.4 nm for TP16 and TP25, respectively, with an emulsification time of <12 s for both formulations. In vitro drug dissolution studies performed at different pH conditions (3.0, 4.5, 6.8) have confirmed the increase in solubility and dissolution rate of the drug by TP16 and TP25 at all pH conditions compared to plain NM. An oral pharmacokinetic study in female Wistar rats showed that the relative bioavailability (Frel) values of TP16 and TP25 over the plain NM were 2.18 (p < 0.05) and 2.24 (p < 0.01), respectively."

These include improved stability, enhanced drug-loading capacity, and controlled release profiles, making them highly attractive candidates for a wide range of therapeutic applications. Their suitability for hydrophobic drugs like a traditional medicinal plant of Thailand as clove oil and alpha-mangostin. We investigated into nanostructured lipid carriers loaded with Alpha-Mangostin and clove oil (NLC-AMCO) into the physicochemical and biological characteristics to identify the formulation with the highest efficacy for treatment. The particle size, charge, polydispersity index, and other characterizations were recorded. The realtime ex vivo penetration was explored using canine gingival tissue. Drug sustained release was assessed by HPLC. Moreover, the antibacterial properties were tested by conventional methods. The NLC-AMCO can be stored at up to 40 °C for 60 days without any alterations in particle characteristics. Gingival tissue penetration and sustained drug release were superior compared to unencapsulated counterparts. It exhibited greater effectiveness in inhibiting bacterial growth than the antibiotics tested, particularly against bacteria from the oral cavities of dogs. Therefore, this alternative treatment approach offers cost-effectiveness and ease of administration for pet owners and reduces discomfort for the animals during restraint."

The extract was prepared by two extraction methods: hydroalcoholic maceration (MAC) with 80% MeOH and supercritical fluid (SCF). The MACCE and SCFCE CE NPs had particle sizes of 71 nm and 20 nm, respectively with irregular spherical shapes. The nanocarriers achieved entrapment efficiencies of over 90%. MACCE-NPs and SCFCE-NPs released 18.35% and 10.12% of the extract after 6 h, respectively. Cell viability decreased to 54%, 7%, and 12% in HeLa, U87, and KB cell lines, respectively, after a 48-hour treatment with SCFCE-NPs and 75%, 8%, and 17% after treatment with MACCE-NPs, significantly reduced compared to the control. It is concluded that NPs containing CE exhibit a higher degree of toxicity due to better penetration into cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2017, Blantyre district had the highest adult HIV prevalence in Malawi (17.7%) and lowest viral suppression (60%). In response, the Ministry of Health expanded prevention and treatment services. We assessed whether outreach to social venues could identify individuals with increased HIV acquisition risk or with unsuppressed HIV not currently reached by clinic-based services. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional biobehavioral survey in Blantyre, Malawi, from January to March 2022. We visited social venues where people meet new sexual partners and government clinics providing HIV testing or STI screening. Participants older than 15 years were interviewed and tested for HIV infection if not on ART. HIV recency tests were performed on those testing positive, and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected to quantify viral load and also to identify acute infection in those with HIV- results. RESULTS: HIV prevalence (18.5% vs 8.3%) and unsuppressed HIV infection (3.9% vs 1.7%) were higher among venue-recruited (n = 1802) than among clinic-recruited participants (n = 2313). Among PLHIV at both clinics (n = 199) and venues (n = 289), 79% were virally suppressed. Few had acute (n = 1) or recent infection (n = 8). Among women, HIV prevalence was 4 times higher (38.9% venue vs 8.9% clinic). At clinics, PLHIV reporting visiting venues were less likely to be suppressed (54.6 vs 82.6%). More men at venues than at clinics reported paying for sex (49% vs 30%) or having multiple sex partners in the past 4 weeks (32% vs 16%). CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced venue-based prevention and testing for men and women could reduce treatment lapses, onward transmission, and improve HIV treatment outcomes.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of transportation on their stress response by measuring hematological values, stress hormone levels, glucose levels, and stress-related gene expression. Betta fish (average body weight 1.91 ± 0.42 g; n = 30) were exposed to simulated transport in a water volume of 40 mL for 12, 24, and 48 h. Baseline levels (pre-transport) were measured prior to the experiment. The control group was transported using water without adding clove oil. Two treatment groups were transported using water with the addition of 1 and 3 mg/L concentrations of clove oil, respectively. The results revealed that transportation can be a factor that affects water quality. The pH and dissolved oxygen levels were significantly lower than baseline, while nitrite and total ammonia concentrations significantly increased. Correlating to the stress responses, significantly increasing total red blood cell counts, plasma cortisol levels, and up-regulating the expression of stress-related genes, including HSP70, GR, MR, and HIF-1α. The addition of 1 mg/L clove oil was found to reduce stress during the transport simulation, as evidenced by a reduction in these stress parameters. Conversely, increasing the concentration of clove oil to 3 mg/L significantly increased plasma cortisol after 12 h of simulated transport, and up-regulated GR, MR, and HIF-1α expression. This study revealed that the transport process can stimulates stress in betta fish but adding a concentration of 1 mg/L clove oil to the transport water could mitigate this stress response and promote animal welfare during their transportation."

      "abstract": "Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes a variety of infections outside the intestine. The treatment of these infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains, which can also be a direct or indirect threat to humans as consumers of poultry products. Therefore, alternative antimicrobial agents are being sought, which could be essential oils, either administered individually or in interaction with antibiotics. Sixteen field isolates of E. coli (originating from 1-day-old broilers) and the ATCC 25922 reference strain were tested. Commercial cinnamon bark, clove bud, lavender flower essential oils (EOs) and enrofloxacin were selected to assess the sensitivity of the selected E. coli strains to antimicrobial agents. The checkerboard method was used to estimate the individual minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each antimicrobial agent as well as to determine the interactions between the selected essential oil and enrofloxacin. In the case of enrofloxacin, ten isolates were resistant at MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL, three were classified as intermediate (0.5-1 μg/mL) and three as sensitive at ≤0.25 μg/mL. Regardless of the sensitivity to enrofloxacin, the MIC for cinnamon EO was 0.25% v/v and for clove EO was 0.125% v/v. All MDR strains had MIC values for lavender EO of 1% v/v, while drug-sensitive isolates had MIC of 0.5% v/v. Synergism between enrofloxacin and EO was noted more frequently in lavender EO (82.35%), followed by cinnamon EO (64.7%), than in clove EO (47.1%). The remaining cases exhibited additive effects. Owing to synergy, the isolates became susceptible to enrofloxacin at an MIC of ≤8 µg/mL. A time-kill study supports these observations. Cinnamon and clove EOs required for up to 1 h and lavender EO for up to 4 h to completely kill a multidrug-resistant strain as well as the ATCC 25922 reference strain of E. coli. Through synergistic or additive effects, blends with a lower than MIC concentration of enrofloxacin mixed with a lower EO content required 6 ± 2 h to achieve a similar effect.",

      "abstract": "Plants have proven to be important sources for discovering new compounds that are useful in the treatment of various diseases due to their phytoconstituents. Clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.), an aromatic plant widely cultivated around the world, has been traditionally used for food preservation and medicinal purposes. In particular, clove essential oil (CEO) has attracted attention for containing various bioactive compounds, such as phenolics (eugenol and eugenol acetate), terpenes (β-caryophyllene and α-humulene), and hydrocarbons. These constituents have found applications in cosmetics, food, and medicine industries due to their bioactivity. Pharmacologically, CEO has been tested against a variety of parasites and pathogenic microorganisms, demonstrating antibacterial and antifungal properties. Additionally, many studies have also demonstrated the analgesic, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory effects of this essential oil. However, CEO could degrade for different reasons, impacting its quality and bioactivity. To address this challenge, encapsulation is viewed as a promising strategy that could prolong the shelf life of CEO, improving its physicochemical stability and application in various areas. This review examines the phytochemical composition and biological activities of CEO and its constituents, as well as extraction methods to obtain it. Moreover, encapsulation strategies for CEO and numerous applications in different food fields are also highlighted."

      "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways strongly associated with interleukin-4 (IL-4), a cytokine that mediates and regulates various immune responses, including allergic reactions. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of an Aqueous Extract of Clove (AEC) Syzygium aromaticum on the lungs and erythrocytes of an experimental asthma model in Wistar rats. For this purpose, four groups of male rats were examined: control, sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA), treated with AEC, and treated with a combination of OVA/AEC. After treatment, the antioxidant effect was determined by measuring the malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) levels. The anti-inflammatory effect was determined by measuring IL-4 levels by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using serum, lung, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. A significant reduction (p ≤ 0.05) in the MDA levels and a significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) in the levels of GPx and CAT were observed in the lungs of rats treated with cloves. However, no statistically significant variation was observed in GSH levels. In erythrocytes, no statistically significant differences were observed between the experimental batches. Regarding the anti-inflammatory effect, the administration of S. aromaticum extract to sensitized rats resulted in a recovery in the levels of total proteins and IL-4 and a decrease in the three compartments studied (lungs, serum, and bronchoalveolar liquid). These results were confirmed by microscopic examination of lung histological sections. Overall, these findings confirmed that the AEC has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to its systemic toxicity, traditional chemotherapy of tumors is being taken into consideration. Herbal therapy, containing phytochemical polyphenol derivatives such as Curcumin (Cur), Ginger (Gin), Cloves (Clov) and Amygdaline (Amyg), is one of the numerous complementary and alternative approaches as an anti-cancer therapy and holds great promise for cancer chemo-prevention with fewer side effects. AIM: The current study was designated to assess anti-tumoral immunity and anti-cancer and chemo-preventive effectiveness of herbal extracts of Cur, Ginger, Clov and Amyg in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC)-challenging mice. METHODS: Chemo-preventive efficacy of herbal extracts of Cur, Gin, Clov and Amyg were analyzed in vivo by examination of the apoptosis rate of EAC tumor cells by flow cytometry. The total numbers of EAC cells, splenocytes counts and leucocytes count with their differentials relative % in peripheral blood (PB) of EACchallenging mice were investigated. RESULTS: EAC-challenging mice treated with herbal extracts of Cur, Gin, Clov and Amyg showed a marked decline in EAC tumor cell count and a noticeable increase in apoptosis rate of EAC tumor cells, a remarkable decrease in serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) with an obvious increase in the number of splenocytes comparing to that in EAC-challenging mice treated with PBS alone. Moreover, the data indicated an insignificant change in the total leucocytes count and their differentials relative % of eosinophil, neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes in EAC-challenging mice treated with Cur and Amyg, but these parameters were markedly increased in EAC-challenging mice injected with Gin and Clov compared to that in EAC-challenging mice treated with PBS alone. CONCLUSION: To conclude, the herbal extracts of Cur, Gin, Clov and Amyg may have anti-tumoral immunity and anti-cancer potency and potential to reduce the resistance to cancer conventional chemotherapy and exert cancer chemo-protective approaches with low adverse effects. Further research is necessary to determine the regimen's toxicity on various tissues and organs and to connect the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches used in the regimen's biomedical use.",

In this study, we evaluated the toxic effect of TiO2-NP on stomach, liver, and kidney tissues and the amelioration effect of clove oil nanoemulsion (CLV-NE) against DNA damage, oxidative stress, pathological changes, and the apoptotic effect of TiO2-NPs. Four groups of male mice were subjected to oral treatment for five consecutive days including, the control group, the group treated with TiO2-NPs (50 mg/kg), the group treated with (CLV-NE) (5% of the MTD), and the group treated with TiO2-NPs plus CLV-NE. The results revealed that the treatment with TiO2-NPs significantly caused DNA damage in the liver, stomach, and kidney tissues due to increased ROS as indicated by the reduction of the antioxidant activity of SOD and Gpx and increased MDA level. Further, abnormal histological signs and apoptotic effect confirmed by the significant elevation of p53 expression were reported after TiO2-NPs administration. The present data reported a significant improvement in the previous parameters after treatment with CLV-NE. These results showed the collaborative effect of the oils and the extra role of nanoemulsion in enhancing antioxidant effectiveness that enhances its disperse-ability and further promotes its controlled release. One could conclude that CLV-NE is safe and can be used as a powerful antioxidative agent to assess the toxic effects of the acute use of TiO2-NPs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is one of the most prevalent symptoms, increasing worldwide with no specific medication for fatigue. Iranian traditional medicine (ITM), or Persian medicine, is a reliable source for discovering natural medicine for diseases and their symptoms. Myrtus communis L. (Myrtle), Malus domestica Borkh. (Apple), and Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & L. M. Perry (Clove) have been utilized as brain and heart tonics in ITM. Based on ITM, cardiac tonics decrease fatigue by enhancing heart function and increasing blood flow to tissues. These plants, particularly myrtle berries, have been utilized as potent enlivening agents that reduce mental fatigue. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the effects of aqueous extracts of these plants on weight-loaded forced swimming (WLFS) tests and three doses of aqueous myrtle extract in an animal model of chronic sleep deprivation-induced fatigue. METHODS: Five groups of rats (n = 6) were evaluated: Sham, control, apple-treated, clove-treated, and myrtle-treated groups. After 28 days of treatment, the WLFS test was performed, and swimming time was recorded. Subsequently, central fatigue was induced in rats by chronic sleep deprivation for 21 days. Five groups of rats (n = 6) were evaluated: Sham, control (sleep-deprived, which received water), and three sleep-deprived + treatment groups, which received aqueous myrtle extract (350, 700, and 1000 mg/kg). An open field test on the 20th day and a WLFS test on the 21st day were performed. RESULTS: The myrtle berries significantly increased glucose, reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and enhanced swimming time. Fatigue caused by chronic sleep deprivation increased malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and LDH while decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), glucose, and swimming time. In all treatment groups, SOD levels and swimming time were increased, whereas MDA, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels were decreased significantly. Only the 1000 mg/kg dose significantly reduced LDH levels (P < 0.001). The treatment significantly improved the velocity and the total distance moved in the open-field test. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, the myrtle berries reduced fatigue in two animal models, probably due to its phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and polysaccharides."

      "abstract": "In this study, we have successfully produced a corn starch-based composite film through the casting method, formulated with clove essential oil nanoemulsion (NCEO) and corn starch. The physical and chemical changes of the composite films were investigated at various concentrations (10 %, 20 % and 40 %) of NCEO. Furthermore, the non-contact preservation effects of the composite films on bread during 15-day storage were also examined in this study. As the concentration of NCEO increased, the composite films presented a gradual thinning, roughening, and yellowing in appearance. Following this, the water content, water vapor permeability rate, and elongation at break of the films decreased, while their hydrophobicity, tensile strength, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity increased accordingly. Through FT-IR, X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetric analysis, it was demonstrated that NCEO has strong compatibility with corn starch. Additionally, the indices' analysis indicated that utilizing the composite film incorporating 40 % NCEO can significantly boost the shelf life and quality of bread. Moreover, it was revealed that application of the non-contact treatment with composite film could potentially contribute certain preservation effects towards bread. In light of these findings, the composite film with non-contact treatment exhibits potential as an effective, safe, and sustainable preservation technique for grain products.",

There was unsatisfactory response to treatment with antibiotics, inhalational corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and antireflux treatment. High-resolution computed tomography was normal. However, fiber optic bronchoscopy revealed a foreign body in the right lower lobe, which was removed and was identified as clove stalk. This led to rapid relief of symptoms. Clove stalk aspiration is an unusual foreign body causing chronic cough, which has not yet been reported."

      "abstract": "Anesthesia serves as an effective method to mitigate the stress response in aquatic animals during aquaculture and product transportation. In this study, we assessed the anesthetic efficacy of clove oil, tricaine methane-sulfonate (MS-222), ethanol, and magnesium chloride by anesthesia duration, recovery time, 24-hour survival rate, and the behavior of mud crabs (Scylla paramamosain). Additionally, the optimal anesthetic concentration for varying body weights of mud crabs was also investigated. The results revealed that clove oil emerged as the optimal anesthetic for mud crabs, with a 24-hour survival rate surpassing those observed in MS-222 and magnesium chloride treatments. Ethanol caused amputation and hyperactivity in mud crabs. Regression analyses between the optimal anesthetic concentration of clove oil and the weight categories of 0.03-27.50 g and 27.50-399.73 g for mud crabs yielded the following equations: y = 0.0036 x3 - 0.1629 x2 + 1.7314 x + 4.085 (R2 = 0.7115) and y = 0.0437 x + 2.9461 (R2 = 0.9549). Clove oil exhibited no significant impact on serum cortisol, glucose, lactate content, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, or superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in mud crabs across different treatment groups. Anesthesia induced by clove oil in mud crabs resulted in an increase in inhibitory neurotransmitters such as glycine. However, the recovery from anesthesia was associated with elevated levels of the excitatory neurotransmitters L-aspartic acid and glutamate. In conclusion, clove oil proves to be a safe and optimal anesthetic agent for mud crabs, exerting no physiological stress on the species."

      "abstract": "This research investigates the viability of using Syzygium aromaticum (clove) as a natural dye for wool yarn through the application of microwave treatment and optimization using central composite design (CCD). As concerns grow over the environmental impact of synthetic dyes and their detrimental disposal in water bodies, the search for eco-friendly alternatives becomes imperative to revolutionize the textile industry. Microwave-assisted extraction of the colorant from clove powder is explored as an efficient and sustainable method, minimizing solvent usage and energy consumption compared to conventional techniques. To enhance colorfastness properties while eliminating the need for toxic mordants, green alternatives such as Al, Fe, and tannic acid, combined with plant phenolics from red sumac, pomegranate rind, and weld, are employed. According to the analysis of CCD, the higher color strength value 18.1653 was achieved using pH = 3, time = 50 min, temperature = 70 °C, and salt concentration = 1.5 g/100 mL. The optimized dyeing conditions also showed a maximum level of colorfastness properties of 5 for light, 5 for wash, 5 for dry rubbing, and 4 for wet rubbing. The findings from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses provide valuable insights into the chemical and morphological changes induced by microwave treatment and dyeing with clove extract. The results affirm the presence of eugenol as a potential active molecule responsible for the captivating color of clove flower buds, validating its suitability as a natural dye source for wool. This study highlights the promising potential of microwave-assisted extraction and plant-based biomolecules as innovative and environmentally friendly approaches in natural dyeing, paving the way for a more sustainable future in the textile industry. Embracing these eco-friendly practices allows the textile sector to reduce its ecological footprint and contribute to a cleaner and greener environment. Further research and implementation of these techniques can foster a more harmonious coexistence with nature, ensuring a healthier ecosystem for all.",

      "abstract": "Long-term use of the nitroimidazole-derived antibiotic metronidazole has been associated with neuronal damage due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Polyphenol-rich plants, such as anise seeds and clove buds, are suggested to have neuroprotective effects. However, their intracellular protective pathway against metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the potential neuroprotective benefits of anise seeds and clove buds and elucidate the proposed metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity mechanism. This study divided rats into six groups, each containing six rats. In Group I, the control group, rats were administered saline orally. Group II rats received 200 mg/kg of metronidazole orally. Group III rats received 250 mg/kg b.w. of anise seed extract and metronidazole. Group IV rats received 500 mg/kg b.w. of anise seed extract (administered orally) and metronidazole. Group V rats received 250 mg/kg b.w. of clove bud extract (administered orally) and metronidazole. Group VI rats were administered 500 mg/kg b.w. of clove bud extract and metronidazole daily for 30 consecutive days. The study evaluated the phenolic compounds of anise seeds and clove buds. Moreover, it assessed the inflammatory and antioxidant indicators and neurotransmitter activity in brain tissues. A histological examination of the brain tissues was conducted to identify neuronal degeneration, brain antioxidants, and apoptotic mRNA expression. The study found that metronidazole treatment significantly altered antioxidant levels, inflammatory mediators, and structural changes in brain tissue. Metronidazole also induced apoptosis in brain tissue and escalated the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Oral administration of metronidazole resulted in a decrease in GABA, dopamine, and serotonin and an increase in ACHE in brain tissue. Conversely, oral administration of anise and clove extracts mitigated the harmful effects of metronidazole. The neurotoxic effects of metronidazole appear to stem from its ability to reduce antioxidants in brain tissue and increase nitric oxide production and apoptosis. The study concludes that neuronal damage caused by metronidazole is significantly mitigated by treatment with anise and clove extracts."

Here, we studied the chemical composition of hexane extract and non-polar fractions (NPF) obtained from the maceration and fractionation of clove buds, in order to evaluate their in vitro antimycobacterial activity, as well as their contribution against efflux pump (EP) resistance through molecular docking experiments. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the volatile profiles revealed the presence of eugenol, followed by eugenyl acetate, and β-caryophyllene as common major compounds. According to Resazurin microtiter assay (REMA), Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Rv strain was sensitive to all volatile samples at concentration range between 10 and 100 μg/mL. The NPF of ethanol extract was the best inhibitor with a MIC=10 μg/mL. The in silico study revealed a strong binding affinity between eugenol and Mmr EP protein (-8.1 Kcal/mol), involving two binding modes of hydrogen bond and π-alkyl interactions. The non-polarity character of clove volatile constituents, and their potential additive or synergistic effects could be responsible for the antimycobacterial activity. In addition, these findings suggest the benefic effect of eugenol in the management of mycobacterium drug resistance, whether as potential inhibitor of Mmr drug EP, or modulator during combination therapy."

OBJECTIVES: The current investigation was carried out to evaluate the effects of Cv and Ts supplementation in drinking water on the morphologic and morphometric adaptations in the lymphoid organs. METHODS: The experiment was conducted on 60 broiler chicks, divided into 4 homogenous groups (5 pens/group and 3 broilers/pen) named T0 (control), T1 (0.5% Cv and 2% Ts), T2 (1% Cv and 3% Ts) and T3 (1.5% Cv and 4% Ts). The treatments were administered from days 8 to 28. Lymphoid organs (thymus, spleen and bursa of Fabricius) were collected on days 14, 21 and 28 after sacrificing five broilers from each group. RESULTS: The treatment groups had higher thymus and spleen weights on day 21, whereas the weights of the bursa of Fabricius were higher on days 14, 21 and 28. In the histomorphologic study, no noticeable difference in the histoarchitectures of the lymphoid organs was noticed. However, substantial differences in the cortico-medullary ratio and the number of follicles in the thymus and bursa of Fabricius, respectively, were found in the histomorphometric investigation. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of Cv and Ts in drinking water augments the weight of lymphoid organs with histomorphometric adaptations that might improve the immune status in broilers.",

To evaluate the adulticidal, ovicidal, larvicidal and repellent proprieties of clove essential oil, eugenol and ethanolic extract on H. scupense, in vitro assays were performed using the adult immersion test (AIT), the ovicidal test, the larval packet test (LPT), the filter paper test and anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. RESULTS: After treatment, eugenol, the primary phytoconstituent of clove oil, which accounts for 97.66% of the whole oil, had 99.22% acaricide activity and inhibited egg hatching at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Eugenol and clove essential oil showed potent adulticidal effect at high concentrations (10 mg/mL), achieving 100 and 93.76% mortality, respectively. The ethanolic extract exhibited moderate activity. At high concentration, the larvicidal activity of S. aromaticum oil, eugenol, and ethanolic extract were 100, 100, and 77.18%, respectively. In filter paper experiments, when tested at the concentration 5 mg/mL; eugenol showed the longest repellent effect up to 6 h. We also found that eugenol was the most active AChE inhibitor (IC50 = 0.178 mg/mL). Nevertheless, additional investigations are required to confirm the accurate mechanism and the relevance of clove in practical application. CONCLUSION: Overall, our research indicated that, because its effectiveness as acaricide, S. aromaticum essential oil and its phytoconstituent eugenol may offer an alternative source for the control of H. scupense cattle ticks."

      "abstract": "Planting aromatic plant might be a promising strategy for safely utilizing heavy metal (HM)-contaminated soils, as HMs in essential oil could be completely excluded using some special technologies with ease. Clove basil (Ocimum gratissimum L.) is an important aromatic plant used in essential oil production. Improving cadmium (Cd) tolerance in clove basil can increase its production and improve the utilization efficiency of Cd-contaminated soils. However, the lack of genomic information on clove basil greatly restricts molecular studies and applications in phytoremediation. In this study, we demonstrated that high levels of Cd treatments (0.8, 1.6 and 6.5 mg/L) significantly impacted the growth and physiological attributes of clove basil. Cd contents in clove basil tissues increased with treatment concentrations. To identify Cd stress-responsive genes, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis using seedlings cultured in the Hoagland's solution without Cd ion (control) or containing 1.6 mg/L CdCl2 (a moderate concentration of Cd stress for clove basil seedlings). A total of 104.38 Gb clean data with high-quality were generated in clove basil under Cd stress through Illumina sequencing. More than 1,800 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after Cd treatment. The reliability and reproducibility of the transcriptomic data were validated through qRT-PCR analysis and Sanger sequencing. KEGG classification analysis identified the \"MAPK signaling pathway,\" \"plant hormone signal transduction\" and \"plant-pathogen interaction\" as the top three pathways. DEGs were divided into five clusters based on their expression patterns during Cd stress. The functional annotation of DEGs indicated that downregulated DEGs were mainly involved in the \"photosynthesis system,\" whereas upregulated DEGs were significantly assigned to the \"MAPK signaling pathway\" and \"plant-pathogen interaction pathway.\" Furthermore, we identified a total of 78 transcription factors (TFs), including members of bHLH, WRKY, AP2/ERF, and MYB family. The expression of six bHLH genes, one WRKY and one ERF genes were significantly induced by Cd stress, suggesting that these TFs might play essential roles in regulating Cd stress responses. Overall, our study provides key genetic resources and new insights into Cd adaption mechanisms in clove basil."

      "abstract": "Pesticides are widely used around the world to increase crop production. They also have negative impacts on animals, humans, and the ecosystem. This is the first report evaluating a novel pomegranate-extract-loaded clove-oil-based nanoemulsion (PELCN) and its potential for reducing oxidative stress and DNA damage, as well as its hepatoprotective effects against imidacloprid (IM) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) toxicity in male rats. The benchmark dose (BMD) approach was also used to study the dose-response toxicity of IM and CPF. IM and CPF were administered daily for 28 days at doses of 14, 28, and 54 mg/kg body weight (bw) of IM and 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg bw of CPF via drinking water. The PELCN was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg bw/day of pomegranate extract, 500 mg/kg bw of the clove oil nanoemulsion, and IM or CPF at high doses in the drinking water. In male rats, IM and CPF caused a reduction in body weight gain and hepatotoxic effects as evidenced by increases in the liver enzymes AST, ALT, and ALP. They caused oxidative damage in the liver of male rats as indicated by the decreased liver activity of the GST, GPX, SOD, and CAT enzymes and decreased serum TAC. IM and CPF produced a significant dose-dependent increase in DNA damage in hepatocyte cells, resulting in moderate to severe liver damage with cells that are more inflammatory and have enlarged sinusoids and compacted nuclei. IM had a higher BMD than CPF for both body and liver weight, suggesting that CPF was more dose-dependently toxic than IM. Albumin was a highly sensitive liver biomarker for IM, while total protein was a biomarker for the CPF-treated rats. GPx was an extremely sensitive biomarker of oxidative stress in the IM treatment, while CAT and GPx were highly sensitive parameters in the CPF-treated rats. Therefore, at comparable doses, CPF has a higher potential to cause liver damage and oxidative stress than IM. The hepatotoxicity of IM and CPF can be mitigated by administering a nanoemulsion containing clove oil and pomegranate extract. The nanoemulsion acts as a protector against the oxidative stress caused by these insecticides, especially at high doses. The nanoemulsion based on clove oil increases the bioavailability and stability of the pomegranate extract, which has antioxidant properties."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a distressing inflammatory autoimmune disease, is managed mainly by Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), e.g. leflunomide (LEF). LEF (BCS class II) has limited solubility and adverse effects following its systemic exposure. The appealing antirheumatic properties of both clove oil and chitosan (CS) were exploited to design oral leflunomide (LEF)-loaded nanoemulsion (NE) system to augment the therapeutic action of LEF and decrease its systemic side effects as well. Different LEF-NEs were prepared using clove oil, Tween® 20 (surfactant), and PEG 400(co-surfactant) and characterized by thermodynamic stability, percentage transmittance, cloud point, size analysis, and drug content. Optimized LEF-NE was subjected to CS coating forming LEF-CS-NE that exhibited nanometric size range, prolonged drug release, and good physical stability. In vivo anti-rheumatic activity of pure LEF, market LEF, and LEF-CS-NE was assessed utilizing a complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) rat model. Treatment with LEF-CS-NE reduced edema rate (48.68% inhibition) and caused a marked reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) (510.9 ± 2.48 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) (397.3 ± 2.53 pg/ml), and rheumatoid factor (RF) (42.58 ± 0.49 U/ml). Furthermore, LEF-CS-NE reduced serum levels of glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) to (83.19%) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) to (40.68%) compared to the control + ve group. The effects of LEF-CS-NE were also superior to both pure and market LEF and showed better results in histopathological studies of paws, liver, kidney, lung, and heart. The remarkable therapeutic and safety profile of LEF-CS-NE makes it a potential oral system for the management of RA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine whether syzygium aromaticum (clove) could help polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, forty adult female Wistar rats (weighing 250 ± 10 g) were divided randomly into five groups; G1: control, G2: PCOS group, G3: PCOS+clove (30 mg/kg/ orally/daily) group, G4: PCOS+clove (60 mg/kg/orally/daily) group, and G5: PCOS+gonadectomy group. The PCOS was induced by a single dose injection of estradiol valerate (16 mg/kg/IM). Following PCOS induction, the rats were treated for 14 days. Histological parameters, follicle apoptosis, mRNA expression of autophagy markers (Lc3, Beclin1), oxidative stress markers, insulin and blood glucose levels, as well as serum levels of aromatase and testosterone were evaluated in these rats. Finally, the ratio of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels was also calculated. RESULTS: The autophagy markers (Lc3, Beclin1), histological parameters, oxidative stress, insulin, and hormone levels changed significantly in the PCOS rats (G2). In G3 and G5 groups, it was observed that the levels of LH/FSH and testosterone decreased significantly in comparison to the PCOS group, and inhibition of autophagy was also observed in these groups. Treatment with cloves in the G3 group significantly improved oxidative stress, histological parameters, and insulin levels. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that oxidative stress, apoptosis, and excessive autophagy could be improved by treatment with low doses of clove and gonadectomy. Cloves may help to improve these parameters by regulating and inhibiting excessive autophagy. However, discovering the direct role of this extract in regulating the parameters such as oxidative stress, insulin, and androgens requires further investigation. In the present study, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

It also stimulates the nerves. Therefore, the aim of this study was to extract and purify EEO from clove buds and assess its ability to combat resistant Helicobacter pylori. Additionally, EEO's anti-inflammatory activity and its ability to suppress H. pylori biofilm formation, which is responsible for antibiotic resistance, was also investigated. Syzygium aromaticum buds were purchased from a local market, ground, and the EEO was extracted by using hydro-distillation and then purified and chemically characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A disk-diffusion assay showed that Helicobacter pylori is sensitive to EEO, with an inhibition zone ranging from 10 ± 06 to 22 ± 04 mm. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of EEO ranged from 23.0 to 51.0 μg/mL against both Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates and standard strains. In addition, EEO showed antibiofilm activity at 25 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL against various Helicobacter pylori strains, with suppression percentages of 49.32% and 73.21%, respectively. The results obtained from the anti-inflammatory assay revealed that EEO possesses strong anti-inflammatory activity, with human erythrocyte hemolysis inhibition percentages of 53.04, 58.74, 61.07, and 63.64% at concentrations of 4, 8, 16, and 32 μg/L, respectively. GC-MS analysis revealed that EEO is a major component of Syzygium aromaticum when extracted with a hydro-distillation technique, which was confirmed by its purification using a chemical separation process. EEO exhibited antibacterial action against resistant Helicobacter pylori strains, as well as antibiofilm and anti-inflammatory activities, and is a promising natural alternative in clinical therapy.",

The aim of this study was to investigate effect of clove mouthwash on the incidence of VAP in the ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This comparative, randomized, triple-blind, clinical trial was conducted on 168 eligible ICU patients at Kosar Hospital in Semnan, Iran, during 2021-2022, who were divided into intervention and control groups using random blocks. The intervention group received clove extract mouthwash at 6.66% concentration, and the control group received chlorhexidine 0.2% twice a day for 5 days (routine care). Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, and disease severity was measured based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, oral health status was examined using the Beck Oral Assessment Scale (BOAS), and VAP diagnosis was made based on the Modified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (MCPIS). RESULTS: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference in disease severity (p = 0.412) and oral health status (p = 0.239) between the patients in the two groups. After the intervention, 20.2% of the patients in the intervention group and 41.7% of those in the control group acquired VAP. The risk of VAP was 2.06 times higher in the control group than in the intervention group (p = 0.005, 95% CI: 1.26-3.37, RR = 2.06), but the severity of VAP did not differ significantly between the patients in the two groups (p = 0.557). CONCLUSION: The findings showed that clove mouthwash reduces the incidence of VAP significantly. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clove mouthwash can be used as a simple and low-cost method to prevent VAP in ICU patients.",

This study aimed to ascertain the dominant pathogens in postharvest bagging-free apples, to evaluate the efficacy of essential oil (EO) on inhibition of fungal growth, and to further clarify the molecular mechanism of this action. By morphological characteristics and rDNA sequence analyses, Botryosphaeria dothidea (B. dothidea) and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (C. gloeosporioides) were identified as the main pathogens isolated from decayed bagging-free apples. Cinnamon and clove EO exhibited high inhibitory activities against mycelial growth both in vapor and contact phases under in vitro conditions. EO vapor at a concentration of 60 μL L-1 significantly reduced the incidence and lesion diameter of inoculated decay in vivo. Observations using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) revealed that EO changed the mycelial morphology and cellular ultrastructure and destroyed the integrity and structure of cell membranes and major organelles. Using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics, it was demonstrated that clove EO treatment impaired the cell membrane integrity and biological function via downregulating the genes involved in the membrane component and transmembrane transport. Simultaneously, a stronger binding affinity of trans-cinnamaldehyde and eugenol with CYP51 was assessed by in silico analysis, attenuating the activity of this ergosterol synthesis enzyme. Moreover, pronounced alternations in the oxidation/reduction reaction and critical materials metabolism of clove EO-treated C. gloeosporioides were also observed from transcriptomic data. Altogether, these findings contributed novel antimicrobial cellular and molecular mechanisms of EO, suggesting its potential use as a natural and useful preservative for controlling postharvest spoilage in bagging-free apples."

Previously, Clove oil is a potential source of an antimicrobial compounds especially vis-a-vis bacterial pathogens. However, the compound responsible for this activity remains to be investigated. Essential oil (EO) clove, acetylated essential oil clove, eugenol, and acetyleugenol were evaluate as an antibacterial potential agent against Staphyloccocus aureus (SE), Escherichia coli (EC) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Essential oil containing eugenol was extracted from buds of Eugenia caryophyllata commonly named clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.) (Family Myrtaceae) by a simple hydrodistillation. The analysis of the essential oils (EOs) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) shows eugenol as the major constituent with 70.14 % of the total. The Eugenol was isolated from the EO using chemical treatment. Afterwards, the EO and eugenol were converted to acetylated EO and acetyleugenol, respectively using acetic anhydride. The antibacterial result revealed that all compounds showed a strong activity against the three strains. The Staphyloccocus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were extremely sensitive against eugenol with an inhibition diameters of 25 mm. The MIC values of eugenol versus S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were 0.58 and 2.32 mg/mL, respectively, while the MIB values were 2.32 mg/mL and 9.28 mg/mL.",

It can be therefore considered a good candidate for wound-healing applications, especially for chronic or diabetic wounds or burns, where the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and detoxification is altered. However, EOs require suitable formulations to be efficiently administered in moist wound environments. Chitosan hydrophobically modified by an ionic interaction with oleic acid (chitosan oleate, CSO) was used in the present work to stabilize CO nanoemulsions (NEs). The dimensions of the NE were maintained at around 300 nm as the volume distribution for up to six months, and the CO content did not decrease to under 80% over 4 months, confirming the good stabilizing properties of CSO. The antioxidant properties of the CO NE were evaluated in vitro by a 2,2-diphenil-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) assay, and in fibroblast cell lines by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) as a spin trap; a protective effect was obtained comparable to that obtained with α-tocopherol treatment. In a murine burn model, the ability of CO formulations to favor macroscopic wound closure was evidenced, and a histological analysis revealed a positive effect of the CO NE on the reparation of the lesion after 18 days. Samples of wounds at 7 days were subjected to a histological analysis and parallel dosage of lipid peroxidation by means of a thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay, confirming the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of the CO NE."

In the current study, we investigated the effect of intraperitoneal administration of clove essential oil (CEO: 20 mg/kg body weight) on certain oxidative stress and glucose metabolism enzymes, as well as the expression of proinflammatory mediators. Administration of CEO to diabetic rats showed a significant decline in blood glucose levels, total cholesterol, and xanthine oxidase, compared to the streptozotocin group. Furthermore, these treated rats elicited a notable attenuation in the levels of lipid peroxides, and thiols groups in both liver and brain tissues. The activities of antioxidant and metabolic enzymes were reverted to normality in diabetic upon CEO administration. In addition to its protective effects on red blood cell hemolysis, CEO is a potent α-amylase inhibitor with an IC50 =298.0±2.75 μg/mL. Also, treatment of diabetic rats with CEO significantly reduced the iNOS expression in the spleen. Our data showed that CEO has potential beneficial effects on diabetes, which can possibly prevent the pathogenesis of diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications.",

Herbal dietary supplements may be beneficial to reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different doses of clove extracts on humoral factors in rats with hepatotoxicity induced by thioacetamide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, rats were divided into nine groups (10 rats per each). The Control group received no treatment. The Sham group was treated with oral administration of distilled water (0.5 ml) for 21 days. The positive control group received thioacetamide (50 mg/kg for three days) intraperitoneally. The clove group was divided into three subgroups and given daily oral administrations of 50, 150, and 300 mg/kg of clove hydroalcoholic extracts (for 21 days). Rats in the experimental group were divided into three subgroups and subjected to 50 mg/kg thioacetamide injection after receiving hydroalcoholic extracts of clove (50, 150, and 300 mg/kg, respectively) for 21 days in the last three days. All rats were sacrificed after 48 hours to measure liver function parameters (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total plasma protein, and albumin). RESULTS: The rats that received thioacetamide showed liver damage by increased serum liver biomarkers and decreased levels of total plasma protein and albumin compared to the control group. The different doses of clove extract resulted in a significant improvement of liver damage by reduced serum liver enzymes levels and increased total plasma protein and albumin. CONCLUSION: Oral administration of the different doses of the clove extract (50, 150, and 300 mg/kg) for 21 consecutive days could significantly improve the changes associated with serum biomarkers of hepatotoxicity.

AIM: This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of clove bud powder (CBP) dietary administration on the performance and jejunum morphology of the broiler chickens. METHODS: A total of 360 1-day-old chicks (Ross 308) were distributed according to a completely randomized design on 3 experimental groups according to CBP% in feed (0.0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%), with 6 replicates for each treatment group. The studied traits included body weight, daily weight gain, daily feed consumption, feed conversion ratio, mortality%, European broiler index (EBI), villus height, crypt depth, and villus height/crypt depth ratio. RESULTS: The broilers final body weight, daily weight gain, and daily feed consumption reduced significantly (p ≤ 0.01) in groups consuming different percentages of CBP, and a significant increase (p < 0.05) in feed conversion ratio was noted in the CBP groups. Adding CBP to feed caused a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the EBI. However, CBP increased (p ≤ 0.01) villus height and villus height/crypt depth ratio (h/c ratio) compared to the control group. On the other hand, the results showed that there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between treatment groups in mortality% and crypt depth. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that the addition of CBP had a negative effect on daily feed consumption, daily body weight gain, final body weight, feed conversion ratio, and EBI at a dose used in this study. But it improved intestinal morphology.",

Their treatment is often ineffective due to the resistance of yeasts to antimycotics. Therefore, there is a need to search for new antifungals. The aim of this study was to determine the antifungal effect of clove essential oil (CEO) and eugenol (EUG) towards both reference and clinical Candida spp. strains isolated from the oral cavity of patients with hematological malignancies, and to investigate their mode of action and the interactions in combination with the selected antimycotics. These studies were performed using the broth microdilution method, tests with sorbitol and ergosterol, and a checkerboard technique, respectively. The CEO and EUG showed activity against all Candida strains with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the range of 0.25-2 mg/mL. It was also found that both natural products bind to ergosterol in the yeast cell membrane. Moreover, the interactions between CEO and EUG with several antimycotics-cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, silver nitrate and triclosan-showed synergistic or additive effects in combination, except nystatin. This study confirms that the studied compounds appear to be a very promising group of phytopharmaceuticals used topically in the treatment of superficial candidiasis. However, this requires further studies in vivo.",

The optimized emulgel was found to possess good texture profile and showed shear thinning behavior. In vitro release study demonstrated complete drug release in 8 h and emulgel was found to be stable for 3 months at 25 °C and 40 °C. In vivo study revealed biofilm dispersal, complete wound closure, re-epithelialization and collagen deposition by LFX-NE gel in comparison to various control groups. LFX-NE gel was able to clear the infection within 7 days of treatment and promote wound healing as well. Therefore, administration of LFX-incorporated NE gel could be a beneficial treatment strategy for P. aeruginosa biofilm-infected burn wounds.",

To improve the reduced fertility in women at advanced maternal age, we developed a combination containing natural extracts from clove, Sophora flower bud and Chinese yam with a mass ratio 15:6:10 and named it as DACHAO. METHODS AND RESULTS: We then gavage DACHAO at a dose of 310 mg/kg BW to female mice at 10 month of age and investigated its effects on ovarian functions. Using MitoTracker probes, ROS, and JC-1 staining, we found that DACHAO treatment improved mitochondria functions in oocytes from aged mice. We also observed increased blastocyst formation when mature oocytes from control and DACHAO treated mice were for IVF and in vitro embryo culture. Cell counting and TUNEL assay further revealed increased cell numbers and decreased apoptosis in blastocysts of DACHAO group. After control or DACHAO treated mice being mated with fertile male mice, fertility test revealed a greater first litter size in the DACHAO group. Further studies demonstrated that DACHAO treatment could alleviate the retarded ovarian function in aged mice via changes in serum hormone levels, over-expression of antioxidant factors, under-expression of inflammation-related factors, and reduced apoptosis in the ovaries. DISCUSSION: Thus, the new combination DACHAO will be a good choice in clinic to improve ovarian functions for women at advanced maternal age.",

      "abstract": "The seed-borne bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) as a causal organism of black rot disease remains the most serious bacterial problem of agricultural production of cruciferous plants worldwide. The eradication of a primary inoculum originating in seeds is available, but no treatment is totally effective. With the threat of developing chemical resistance and increasing pressure for sustainable disease management, biocontrol methods represent one of the main strategies currently applied in agriculture. Natural antimicrobials, including essential oils, are promising tools in disease management with low risks of environmental pollution and impact on human health. Thyme and clove essential oils were demonstrated to be highly effective in Xanthomonas studies in vitro; therefore, their application in black rot control was evaluated in this study. From five phenolic substances originating from thyme and clove essential oils (carvacrol, eugenol, linalool, p-cymene and thymol), the most promising in vitro results were observed with carvacrol, for which 0.0195% led to the death of all Xcc cells in 30 min. Moreover, a synergistic antibacterial effect of carvacrol and thymol solutions decreased the minimal inhibition concentration to 0.0049% and 0.0195% for carvacrol and thymol, respectively. Using the quadruple bactericidal values, the complete elimination of Xcc from the surface of infested cabbage seeds was obtained for both carvacrol and thymol solutions and their combined mixture at 2 MIC value. The elimination of bacterial infection from germinated cabbage plants was observed for both plate counting and quantitative real-time PCR methods. We also evaluated the effect of the application of phenolic treatment on the seed germination and germinated plants. Our results suggest a high potential of the application of carvacrol and thymol in vegetable seed production, specifically for cabbage, thus representing a suitable alternative to cupric derivatives."

Hence, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of clove powder and tulsi extract on the growth performance, gut morphologic and morphometric indices, and cecal microbial status of broiler, as an alternative to antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs). Sixty day-old chicks of Cobb-500 strain were randomly divided into 4 groups, each having 15 birds. Chicks of the control group (T0) were fed commercial broiler feed with no additional supplementation. The treatment groups were offered commercial broiler feed and received clove powder and tulsi extract with drinking water at the rate of 0.5% + 2% (T1), 1% + 3% (T2), and 1.5% + 4% (T3), respectively. Results showed a nonlinear relationship with the dosage of clove and tulsi. All the growth parameters substantially (P < 0.05) improved in T2 while T1 and T3 showed no significant improvement compared to T0. The final body weight was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in T2. Giblet and offal weights showed no noticeable differences except in the intestine and heart where intestine weight markedly (P < 0.05) decreased in T3 and heart weight significantly (P < 0.05) increased in T1 and T2. Clove and tulsi supplementation substantially improved the villus height and villus surface area of the small intestine in T2 while the large intestine remained mostly unaffected by the treatment. Cecal microbial status significantly improved in all the treatment groups having increased (P < 0.05) Lactobacillus spp. count and decreased (P < 0.05) E. coli count compared to T0. Based on the aforementioned findings, it can be concluded that the combination of clove and tulsi can improve the growth performance and gut health of broilers which is largely dose-dependent and might be supplied as a potential alternative to AGPs.",

In the present work, essential oils extracted from clove buds (Jambosa caryophyllus ) (EO-JC) were investigated for their composition, antifungal, and insecticidal properties. Extraction of EO-JC was performed by use of hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus, and the EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antifungal activity of EO-JC was evaluated by the use of solid-state diffusion (disc method) and microdilution to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), against three strains of fungus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, and Fusarium oxysporum. Insecticidal activity of EO-JC against the cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus, was determined to assess utility of EO-JC to control this pest. Several exposures including inhalation and contact were used to determine lethality, as well as the repulsion test was conducted at concentrations of 4, 8, 16, and 32 μL EO-JC. Characterization of EO-JC by GC/MS revealed 34 compounds accounting for 99.98% of the mass of the extract. The predominant compound was eugenol (26.80%) followed by β-caryophyllene (16.03%) and eugenyl acetate (5.83%). The antifungal activity of EO-JC on solid media exhibited inhibitions in the range of 49% to 87%, and MIC was between 3.125 and 7.80 μg EO-JC/mL. Insecticidal activity, as determined by the use of the inhalation test, and expressed as the LD50 and LD95 after 96 hours of exposure was 2.32 and 21.92 μL/L air, respectively. In the contact test, a 96-hour exposure resulted in LD50 and LD95 of 5.51 and 11.05 μL/L of air, respectively. EO-JC exhibited insecticidal activity against fungi and pest chickpea weevil."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a combination of Capsicum oleoresin and clove essential oil (botanicals; BTC) on lactational performance, nutrient utilization, enteric methane (CH4) emissions, and blood parameters in dairy cows. Twenty Holstein cows (12 multiparous and 8 primiparous) averaging (±SD) 77 ± 28 d in milk in the beginning of the study were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment with 4 periods of 28 d each. Cows were grouped into squares based on parity, milk yield and days in milk, and assigned to 1 of 4 treatments: control (CON), 150, 300, or 600 mg/cow per day of BTC. Cows received the same basal diet and BTC were top-dressed on the total mixed ration once daily. Dry matter intake, milk production, and milk composition were not affected by BTC supplementation, except for milk fat content that tended to be increased in BTC, compared with CON. Daily CH4 emission (measured using the GreenFeed system) was linearly decreased by up to 7.5% with increasing doses of BTC. Treatment decreased CH4 yield (kg of CH4 ÷ kg of DMI) and tended to decrease CH4 intensity (kg of CH4 ÷ kg of milk or energy-corrected milk yields) by 5% in BTC, compared with CON. Supplementation of BTC resulted in a quadratic decrease of serum β-hydroxybutyrate in all cows, and a linear decrease of serum insulin concentration in primiparous but not in multiparous cows. Nutrient utilization and other blood parameters (e.g., blood cells count) were not affected by BTC in the current study. The reduction of enteric CH4 emission demonstrates a moderate mitigation effect on carbon footprint of milk by BTC supplementation. These results must be further investigated and confirmed in longer-term experiments.",

The present study aimed to improve the properties of CEO by microencapsulation with cyclodextrin metal organic frameworks (β-CD-MOFs) to enhance the preservation effects on Chinese bacon (preserved meat products). The microencapsulated CEO by β-CD-MOFs (CEO/β-CD-MOFs) not only did not inhibit the antioxidant activities of CEO, but also showed significant improvements on their ROS scavenging abilities and thermo-/pH-stabilities. The increases of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities were 20.74% and 12.84%, respectively. In addition, less lipid oxidation, including malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and peroxide values (POV), of Chinese bacon was found after the CEO/β-CD-MOFs treatment than CEO and synthetic antioxidant (BHT) treatments. These results suggested the enhanced preservation effects of microencapsulated CEO on the processing of Chinese bacon and the great potential of β-CD-MOFs as carriers for essential oils in food industry applications.",

      "abstract": "Wounds are characterised by an anatomical disruption of the skin; this leaves the body exposed to opportunistic pathogens which contribute to infections. Current wound healing bandages do little to protect against this and when they do, they can often utilise harmful additions. Historically, plant-based constituents have been extensively used for wound treatment and are proven beneficial in such environments. In this work, the essential oil of clove bud (Syzygium aromaticum) was incorporated in a polycaprolactone (PCL) solution, and 44.4% (v/v) oil-containing fibres were produced through pressurised gyration. The antimicrobial activity of these bandage-like fibres was analysed using in vitro disk diffusion and the physical fibre properties were also assessed. The work showed that advantageous fibre morphologies were achieved with diameters of 10.90 ± 4.99 μm. The clove bud oil fibres demonstrated good antimicrobial properties. They exhibited inhibition zone diameters of 30, 18, 11, and 20 mm against microbial colonies of C. albicans, E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, respectively. These microbial species are commonly problematic in environments where the skin barrier is compromised. The outcomes of this study are thus very promising and suggest that clove bud oil is highly suitable to be applied as a natural sustainable alternative to modern medicine."

      "abstract": "Various anticancer medications have been discovered due to advances in the health care industry, but they have undesirable side effects. On the other hand, anticancer drugs derived from natural sources have low side effects, making them excellent for cancer therapy. This study aims to evaluate the effect of clove flower extract (Syzygium aromaticum) as a potential anticancer agent by determining grid-score values using molecular docking and LC50 values using the brine shrimp lethality test (BSLT) technique. As animal models, three hundred larvae of Artemia salina leach were divided into six groups. Each group has ten larvae that have undergone five replications. The clove flower extract concentration in the treatment media was 50 ppm (T1), 250 ppm (T2), 500 ppm (T3), 750 ppm (T4), 1000 ppm (T5), and 0 ppm (seawater) as the control. The probit analysis of Artemia Salina leach mortality percentage data. The results indicated that the clove flower extract (Syzygium aromaticum) is harmful to larvae with LC50 values of 227,1 g/ml or in the equation y = 2,8636 x - 1,7466 with an R2 value of 0.9062. According to molecular docking, eugenol acetate (grid-score -42.120834) has a close relationship with the cognate enzyme nitric oxide synthase (3E7G) based on its proximity to the grid score value (grid-score -61.271812). Therefore, clove flower extract has the potential to act as an anticancer medication. Based on the grid-score proximity, eugenol acetate is close to the homologous enzyme nitric oxide synthase (3E7G). Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase also shows a reduction in cancer cell proliferation."

Herein, this study aims to evaluate the potential of EU in obesity prevention and to delineate the mechanisms involved. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice are fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with EU (0.2%, w/w) for 13 weeks. EU significantly reduces obesity-related indexes including final body weight, body weight gain, adipocyte size, visceral fat-pad weight, and fasting blood glucose. EU prevents HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, as indicated by the increase of Firmicutes and decrease of Desulfobacterota at phylum level, and the increase of Dubosiella, Blautia, unclassified_f_Oscillospiraceae, and unclassified_f_Ruminococcaceae, and the decrease of Alistipes, Alloprevotella, and Bilophila at genus level. Notably, the obesity-related indexes are positively correlated with the relative abundances of Bacteroides, unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae, Colidextribacter, and Bilophila, and negatively correlated with the relative abundances of norank_f_Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group. Moreover, the preventive effects of EU on obesity are accompanied by the transcriptomic reprogramming of white adipose tissue. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that EU prevents the HFD-induced adiposity and modulates gut dysbiosis, and highlight the potential of EU in obesity intervention as a functional dietary supplement.",

The treatment of halloysite nanotubes with NaOH increased the surface area from 50.16 m2⋅g-1 to 57.01 m2⋅g-1 and pore volume from 0.25 cm3⋅g-1 to 0.32 cm3⋅g-1. The as-synthesized nanocomposite films were characterized for physical, thermal, mechanical and water vapor barrier properties towards their use as food packaging material. The nanocomposite film PCOH0.5 (consisting 0.5 wt% NHNT and 200 μL CEO) possessed the best physical properties with percentage enhancements over PLA as: surface hydrophobicity (20.2 %), water vapor barrier (42.1 %), thermal stability (3.2 %), flexibility (682 %), tensile strength (20 %), elastic modulus (38 %), UV barrier property (62 %). In addition, a practical packaging test was performed on cut apples stored at room temperature for 6 days. The PCOH0.5 films showed substantially improved results (as compared to PLA) as follows: weight loss (40.5 %), mesophilic count (4.0 %), firmness (116.6 %), titratable acidity (110.8 %), pH (2.9 %) and total soluble solids (8.9 %). The results clearly indicate the efficiency of PLA/CEO/NHNT nanocomposite films as potential active food packaging material.",

In order to promote an efficient wound repair, and to avoid antibiotics, antibacterial plant extracts can be incorporated. In the present work, the new electrospun nanofibre membranes based on monobasic phosphate curdlan (PCurd) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were obtained for the first time. To establish the adequate mixing ratio for electrospinning, the behaviour of the PCurd and PVA mixture was studied by viscometry and rheology. In order to confer antimicrobial activity with the nanofibre membrane, clove essential oil (CEO) was incorporated into the electrospun solution. Well-defined and drop-free nanofibres with a diameter between 157 nm and 110 nm were obtained. The presence of CEO in the obtained nanofibres was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, by the phenolic and flavonoid contents, and by the antioxidant activity of the membranes. In physiological conditions, CEO was released from the membrane after 24 h. The in vivo antimicrobial tests showed a good inhibitory activity against E. coli and higher activity against S. aureus. Furthermore, the viability cell test showed the lack of cytotoxicity of the nanofibre membrane with and without CEO, confirming its potential use in wound treatment."

Still, there is no proper treatment available to overcome the disease, which urges the research community and pharmaceutical industries to screen a novel therapeutic intervention to combat the current pandemic. This current study exploits the natural phytochemicals obtained from clove, a traditional natural therapeutic that comprises important bioactive compounds used for targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. As a result, inhibition of viral replication effectively procures by targeting the main protease, which is responsible for the viral replication inside the host. Pharmacokinetic studies were evaluated for the property of drug likeliness. A total of 53 bioactives were subjected to the study, and four among them, namely, eugenie, syzyginin B, eugenol, and casuarictin, showed potential binding properties against the target SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The resultant best bioactive was compared with the commercially available standard drugs. Furthermore, validation of respective compounds with a comprehensive molecular dynamics simulation was performed using Schrödinger software. To further validate the bioactive phytochemicals and delimit the screening process of potential drugs against coronavirus disease 2019, in vitro and in vivo clinical studies are needed to prove their efficacy."

Six diets were prepared, containing combinations of LO (3, 6 and 9%) and CLEO (0.5 and 1%): 3% LO + 0.5% CLEO; 3% LO + 1% CLEO; 6% LO + 0.5% CLEO; 6% LO + 1% CLEO; 9% LO + 0.5% CLEO; 9% LO + 1% CLEO. Results showed increase in the incorporation of n-3 fatty acids in the muscle concomitantly with the addition of LO and CLEO. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were reduced and the glutathione content had increased. Lipid peroxidation was lower in the treatment with 1% CLEO, regardless of LO content. The expression of the PPAR-α and the SREBP-2 genes was higher in animals fed 9% LO + 0.5% CLEO. Therefore, for a greater incorporation and protection against the oxidative damages of n-3 fatty acids, a combined use of 9% LO with 0.5% CLEO is recommended for zebrafish.",

Spermidine (SPD) is a known autophagy modulator and supplementation for COVID-19 risk groups (including the elderly) is recommended. However, information on the modulatory effects of eugenol (EUG) is scarce. Therefore, the effects of SPD and EUG, both singularly and in combination, on autophagy were investigated using different cell lines (HBEpiC, SHSY5Y, HUVEC, Caco-2, L929 and U937). SPD (0.3 mM), EUG (0.2 mM) and 0.3 mM SPD + 0.2 mM EUG, significantly increased autophagy using the hallmark measure of LC3-II protein accumulation in the cell lines without cytotoxic effects. Using Caco-2 cells as a model, several crucial autophagy proteins were upregulated at all stages of autophagic flux in response to the treatments. This effect was verified by the activation/differentiation and migration of U937 monocytes in a three-dimensional reconstituted intestinal model (Caco-2, L929 and U937 cells). Comparable benefits of SPD, EUG and SPD + EUG in inducing autophagy were shown by the protection of Caco-2 and L929 cells against lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. SPD + EUG is an innovative dual therapy capable of stimulating autophagy and reducing inflammation in vitro and could show promise for COVID-19 risk groups.",

There were three groups of films tested (1) MF: mung bean flour alone, (2) MFC: MF incorporated with 2% clove oil (C), and (3) MFCU: MFC prepared with sonication (25 kHz, 100% amplitude, 10 min). Film thickness and bulk density showed slight differences, and moisture content, solubility, and water vapor permeability significantly differed between the formulations. Tensile strength, elongation at break, and Young’s modulus were highest for the MFCU films, followed by MFC and MF in rank order. Furthermore, the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results also demonstrated that the clove oil and sonication treatment had improved the interconnections of the biopolymers, thus increasing the physical strength of the film. Phytochemicals in terms of total phenolics and total flavonoids were elevated in the MFCU films and contributed to stronger radical scavenging abilities (p < 0.05). MFC and MFCU films showed a strong antibacterial control of the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and also of the Gram-negative Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni). Overall, the lipid oxidation indicators Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS, peroxide value, p-anisidine value, and totox value) showed significantly high inhibition, attributed to radical scavenging activities in the MFCU and MFC samples. The mung bean flour films incorporated with clove oil and prepared with sonication have good potential as packaging materials for food due to strong physical, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, as well as lipid oxidation inhibiting abilities."

METHODS: This study aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory effect (paw edema test) and the anti-nociceptive effect (hot plate and formalin test) of nanoemulsion-based gels containing the essential oils in the animal model. Cinnamon and Clove essential oils nanoemulsions with droplet sizes of 28 ± 6 nm and 12 ± 3 nm were first prepared. By adding carboxymethylcellulose (3.5% w/v), the nanoemulsions were then gelified. Finally, the nanogels were characterized by ATR-FTIR analysis and were used as topical pre-treatment before induction of inflammation or pain in acute and chronic analgesic experimental studies. RESULTS: The paw edema and formalin findings showed that the nanogels formulations possess significant anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects.

      "abstract": "Treatment of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is of great challenge as it is shown to be infected by multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR bacteria). Sixty four bacterial isolates were isolated from DFU cases; antibiotic susceptibility tests were carried out for all of them. One bacterial isolate (number 11) was shown to resist the action of 8 out of 12 antibiotics used and was identified by both a Vitek-2 system and 16S rRNA fingerprints as belonging to Proteus mirabilis, and was designated Proteus mirabilis LC587231 (P. mirabilis). Clove flower extract (CFE) inhibited distinctively the P. mirabilis bacterium obtained. GC-MS spectroscopy showed that this CFE contained nine bioactive compounds. The effect of CFE on wound healing of Type 1 diabetic albino rats (Rattus norvegicus) was studied. The results indicated that topical application of CFE hydrogel improved wound size, wound index, mRNA expression of the wound healing markers (Coli1, MMP9, Fibronectin, PCNA, and TGFβ), growth factor signaling pathways (PPAR-α, PGC1-α, GLP-1, GLPr-1, EGF-β, EGF-βr, VEGF-β, and FGF-β), inflammatory cytokine expression (IL8, TNFα, NFKβ, IL1β, and MCP1), as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL4 & IL10), pro-apoptotic markers (FAS, FAS-L, BAX, BAX/BCL-2, Caspase-3, P53, P38), as well as an antiapoptotic one (BCL2). Furthermore, it improved the wound oxidative state and reduced the wound microbial load, as the cefepime therapy improved the wound healing parameters. Based on the previous notions, it could be concluded that CFE represents a valid antibiotics alternative for DFU therapy since it improves diabetic wound healing and exerts antibacterial activity either in vitro or in vivo.",

      "abstract": "Dormancy of freshly harvested garlic cloves does not allow early emergence, and preplanting garlic clove treatment is critical for more than one cycle of production in a year. This field experiment was conducted to assess the effect of treating cloves on emergence, growth, and yield of \"Tseday\" variety during the main cropping season of 2014/2015 and off-season of 2015/16 at Haramaya University. The experiment was arranged in a factorial combination of four (cold stored at 7°C for the duration of 10, 20, and 30 days and stored at room temperature 21°C for 30 days as control), two (whole and topped clove), and four GA3 treatment at concentration of 0, 125, 250, and 375 mg/l and distilled water treatment as second control laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications. The three main factors (clove type, cold storage duration, and GA3) and growing season showed significant influence on phenology, growth, bulb yield and yield components, and all size categories of cloves, while GA3 showed nonsignificant effect on days to emergence of cloves. Clove type interacted with cold storage duration and GA3, and cold storage duration interacted with GA3 significantly to influence all characters of the variety. In addition, the growing season also interacted with clove type and GA3 to influence all categories of clove size, bulb diameter, average bulb weight, and total bulb yield. The three main factors (clove type × cold storage duration × GA3) interaction significantly influenced all characteristics of the variety. However, 30 days of cold-stored and topped cloves reduced dormancy period and days to maturity by 18.84 and 19.50 days, respectively, and increased total bulb yield by 70.32% as compared to the control treatment. In addition, this treatment combination significantly increased most of the growth and bulb yield components, while the number and weight of small-sized cloves were decreased. Hence, it can be concluded that 30 days of cold storage and topping of cloves without soaking under GA3 could be recommended to enhance early emergence, good vegetative growth, and total bulb yield of the garlic variety both under rain-fed and irrigated conditions.",

Post-acute COVID-19 (long-haul COVID-19) can range from serious complications to quality of life symptoms such as fatigue or insomnia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential for inhalation of essential oils to improve energy levels among otherwise healthy female survivors of acute COVID-19 who experience a lack of energy more than five months after recovery. This study was conducted in the United States in late 2021. METHOD: This was a randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the potential for inhalation of Longevity™, a proprietary essential oil blend manufactured by Young Living Essential Oils (Lehi, Utah, USA), on energy levels among female survivors of COVID-19 who continue to experience fatigue more than 5 months recovery from the acute infection. Forty women were randomized to two groups: intervention and placebo. Both groups inhaled the assigned product twice daily for fourteen consecutive days. Fatigue scores were measured using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory (MFSI). Secondary outcomes included scores on each of the MFSI's ten subscales. RESULTS: Individuals who inhaled the essential oil blend for 2 weeks had significantly lower fatigue scores after controlling for baseline scores, employment status, BMI, olfactory function, and time since diagnosis, with a large effect size (F (1,39) = 6.15, p = .020, partial eta squared = 0.198). Subscale analysis identified subscales of vigor, as well as global, behavioral, general, and mental fatigue as benefiting from the intervention. This study provides evidence that a proprietary aromatherapy blend can significantly improve energy levels among women who are experiencing fatigue after recovering from COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, ciliate infections have caused serious casualties to corals in the ocean. Infected corals die within a short period of time, which not only poses a threat to wild coral reefs, but also has a major impact on large scale aquaculture of coral. Clove is a kind of Chinese medicine with antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, insecticidal, and other functions. Clove is a natural product. If it can be used in the treatment of coral ciliates, it will reduce this threat to the environment. The clove extract was diluted with sterile seawater to 500 ppm, 1500 ppm, 2500 ppm, 5000 ppm, 7500 ppm, and 10,000 ppm to carry out virulence test on ciliates. The results show that the LC50 value is 1500 ppm, which can cause the death of ciliates in 10 min without causing significant changes in G. columna SOD, CAT, chlorophyll a, and zooxanthellae. In addition, observation of tissue slices revealed that no ciliates and vacuum were found in the G. columna tissue after 10 min of medicated bathing. In summary, 1500 ppm of clove extract can be used for the treatment of coral ciliates."

Aromaticum L. bud essential oil (SABE) to the Nanoemulsion drug delivery system (SABE-NE) and investigating its anti-tumor and apoptotic impacts against the human HT-29 colon cancer cells. Applying the ultra-sonication method and characterization by DLS and FESEM analysis facilitates the nanoemulsification procedure. Human cancer (HT-29) and normal (HFF) cell lines were then evaluated based on the SABE-NE apoptotic and cytotoxic effects. In an in vitro section, flow cytometry method, Cas3 gene profile, AO/PI cell staining, and MTT assays are used to analyze the apoptotic and cytotoxic activities. In further analysis, liver lipid peroxidation and antioxidant genes expression (SOD, CAT, and GPx) investigate alterations in mice organs. As a result, produced 131.2 nm SABE-NE induces apoptosis response and cellular death (Cas3 up-regulation and enhanced SubG1 peaks). Subsequently, the HT-29 cells' viability can reduce significantly, while HFF cells indicate confined cytotoxic impacts. Moreover, in vivo test results on mice livers demonstrate the cytoprotective properties of SABE-NE (reduced lipid peroxidation and increased antioxidant enzymes gene expression and nondetectable cytotoxic impacts). We produced a novel nanoemulsion drug delivery system called SABE-NE, a cell-specific apoptotic inducer. We thus can be utilized as an efficient anti-cancer compound for human colon cancer treatment. However, further supplementary studies are required to verify and approve its cell-specific anti-tumor activity."

Clove and cinnamon oils have been acknowledged for their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial activity, and antifungal effects in the oral cavity. The aim of this study, therefore, was to prepare clove/cinnamon oils-loaded emulgel and to assess its efficacy in treating Candida albicans-associated denture stomatitis. Central composite design was adopted to formulate and optimize clove/cinnamon extracts-loaded emulgel. The formulated preparations were assessed for their physical appearance, particle size, viscosity, spreadability, and in-vitro drug release. In addition, in-vivo therapeutic experiments were conducted on 42 patients with denture stomatitis. The prepared emulgel formulations showed good physical characteristics with efficient drug release within 3 h. In addition, in-vivo antifungal studies revealed that the optimized formula significantly (p < 0.001) reduced Candida colony counts from the denture surface, compared to commercially available gel (240.38 ± 27.20 vs. 398.19 ± 66.73 CFU/mL, respectively). Furthermore, the optimized formula and succeeded in alleviating denture stomatitis-related inflammation with a better clinical cure rate compared to commercially available gel Collectively, herbal extracts-loaded emulgel might be considered an evolution of polyherbal formulations and might represent a promising alternative to the existing allopathic drugs for the treatment of denture stomatitis, with better taste acceptability and no side effects."

In this study, we successfully developed a tunable controlled-release lipid platform for the efficient delivery of clove oil (CO) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The ultra-small nanostructured lipid carriers co-loaded with CO (CONCs) were developed through an aqueous titration method followed by microfluidization. The CONCs appeared to be spherical (particle size of 120 nm), stable (zeta potential of -27 mV), and entrapped efficiently (84.5%). In toluene:acetone:glacial acetic acid (90:9:1 percent v/v/v) solvent systems, high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis revealed the primary components in CO as eugenol (RF = 0.58). The CONCs greatly increased the therapeutic impact of CO in both in vitro and in vivo biological tests, which was further supported by excellent antiarthritic action. The CONC had an antiarthritic activity that was slightly higher than neat CO and slightly lower than standard, according to our data. The improved formulation inhibited serum lysosomal enzymes and proinflammatory cytokines while also improving hind leg function. This study provides a proof of concept to treat RA with a new strategy utilizing essential oils via nanodelivery.",

      "abstract": "Garlic is an important cash crop in many regions of Ethiopia. However, the yield of the crop is constrained by several factors. Among these, inappropriate clove size is one of the major agronomic practices that can decrease the yield of the crop. Hence, a field experiment was conducted during the 2020/21 main cropping season at Debre Berhan University, College of Agriculture and Natural Resource Sciences, demonstration and research site to evaluate the effect of clove size on growth and bulb yield of garlic (Allium sativum L.). The treatments consisted of five clove sizes: 1-1.49 g, 1.5-1.99 g, 2-2.50 g, 2.51-2.99 g, and 3-3.5 g. An improved variety \"Tseday\" was used as a planting material. The experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement and replicated for three times. The results revealed that clove size significantly influenced all growth and yield parameters of garlic. Planting of 3-3.5 g cloves reduced days to emergence by 11 and 6.33 days and days to maturity by 28.33 and 18.00 days, respectively, as compared to planting of 1-1.49 g and 2-2.5 g cloves. This treatment also increased total bulb yield by 25.88% and 15.58%, respectively, as compared to planting of 1-1.49 g and 2-2.5 g cloves. In addition, this treatment significantly increased most of the growth and bulb yield components. Hence, it can be concluded that planting of 3-3.5 g cloves could be recommended to enhance early emergence, good vegetative growth, and total bulb yield of garlic.",

Since ACE2 is a favorable enzyme, we were interested in finding a molecule capable of binding spike S1, but not ACE2, and inhibiting the interaction between spike S1 and ACE2. Holy basil (Tulsi) has a long history as a medicine for different human disorders. Therefore, we screened different components of Tulsi leaf and found that eugenol, but not other major components (e.g. ursolic acid, oleanolic acid and β-caryophylline), inhibited the interaction between spike S1 and ACE2 in an AlphaScreen-based assay. By in silico analysis and thermal shift assay, we also observed that eugenol associated with spike S1, but not ACE2. Accordingly, eugenol strongly suppressed the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, but not vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), into human ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells. Eugenol also reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced activation of NF-κB and the expression of IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα in human A549 lung cells. Moreover, oral treatment with eugenol reduced lung inflammation, decreased fever, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice. Therefore, selective targeting of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1, but not ACE2, by eugenol may be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the dietary effects of rosemary and clove essential oils separately and in combination on the growth performance; immunological, hematological, and physiological responses; and antioxidant status of growing rabbits. One hundred forty-four of 42-day-old growing V-line rabbits (both sexes with initial live body weights of 765 ± 6 g) were randomly allocated into four treatment groups of 36 rabbits each. Each group was further sub-divided into 12 replicates of 3 rabbits in a completely randomized design. The 1st group was fed a basal diet free of additives and served as the control group, the 2nd and 3rd groups were fed basal diets supplemented with rosemary and clove essential oils, respectively, at doses of 400 mg/kg diet. The 4th group received a basal diet supplemented with a combination of clove and rosemary essential oils at doses of 200 mg/kg diet each. The results showed that the different supplementations did not influence rabbit performance or immunological traits. Opposite to performance or immunological traits, differences in red blood cells and hemoglobin value among all dietary treatments were improved (P < 0.05). Dietary essential oil supplementation with clove, rosemary oil, or a mixed of both increased (P < 0.05) blood concentrations of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase by 47, 42, and 7%; 56, 35, and 36%; and 40, 39, and 37%, respectively, in supplemented rabbits versus control rabbits. In conclusion, clove and/or rosemary essential oils can potentially be used in rabbit diets to improve antioxidant status without change in rabbit's growth performance or immunological parameters.",

This study was aimed at development of natural polymer-based mucoadhesive bilayer films loaded with moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Mox) and clove essential oil (CEO) to potentially combat bacterial infection associated with periodontitis. METHODS: Films were synthesized by double solvent casting technique having an antibiotic in the gellan gum-based primary layer with clove oil in a hydroxyethyl cellulose-based secondary layer. RESULTS: Prepared films were transparent, flexible, and showed high antibacterial response against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The films showed excellent pharmaceutical attributes in terms of drug content, folding endurance, swelling index, and mucoadhesive strength. Solid state characterization of formulation showed successful incorporation of drug and oil in separate layers of hydrogel structure. An in-vitro release study showed an initial burst release of drug followed by sustained release for up to 48 hours. CONCLUSION: The prepared mucoadhesive bilayer buccal films could be used as a potential therapeutic option for the management of periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the field of dentistry, topical anesthetics play an important role in reducing pain during needle pricks. The anesthetic property of betel leaves remain unexplored, even though they have been widely used for the treatment of various ailments. The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate pain perception following topical application of lignocaine gel, clove gel, ice, and newly developed betel leaf extract gel during intraoral injection in children. METHODS: Sixty children aged 6-10 years who met the inclusion criteria were divided into four groups. Topical anesthetic agents, 2% lignocaine (Lox-2% Jelly, Neon, Mumbai, India), 4.7% clove gel (Pain Out Dental Gel, Colgate Palmolive India Ltd, Solan, India), 10% betel leaf extract gel, and ice were applied to each group for one min, followed by administration of infiltration anesthesia. Pain perception was analyzed during needle insertion. The Wong Bakers FACES pain rating scale (WBFPRS) was used for subjective assessment and the Sound, Eye, Motor (SEM) scale for objective assessment. Recorded values were tabulated and subjected to appropriate statistical analysis using SPSS software with a P value set at 0.05. RESULTS: The clove oil and betel leaf groups demonstrated the highest WBFPRS scores, followed by the ice and lignocaine groups. The clove, betel leaf extract, and ice groups showed equal and highest SEM scores, followed by the lignocaine group. The mean WBFPRS and mean SEM scores were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Betel leaf extract gel is effective in reducing pain and can act as an alternative topical anesthetic agent."

      "abstract": "This study is aimed at identifying the chemical composition of the essential oil extracted from the Syzygium aromaticum seeds, as well as investigating its biological activities, insecticide effect, and allelopathic properties. The extraction yield was about 14.3 and 7.14% for grounded and ungrounded seeds, respectively. The GC-MS analysis allowed the identification of 17 heterogeneous compounds, including eugenol (68.7-87.4%), as major compound, cyperene (20.5-7.2%), phenethyl isovalerate (6.4-3.6%), and cis-thujopsene (1.9-0.8%), respectively, for grounded and ungrounded seeds. Concerning the antibacterial activity, the diameter of the inhibition zone reached 35 mm when the essential oil extracted from grounded seeds was applied against Escherichia coli. Regarding the antioxidant activity via the DPPH radical scavenging test, the IC50 varied from 1.2 ± 0.1 to 2.8 ± 0.5 μg/mL. With respect to reducing power, the efficient concentration EC50 ranged from 32 to 50 μg/mL. The essential oil exhibited also an allelopathic effect against seeds of Hyoscyamus niger, as well as an insecticide effect against Sitophilus oryzae with a DL50 value of 252.4 μL/L air. These findings enhance the use of this spice as a natural food preservative and encourage its use in several fields, including pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agriculture, and therapy, that could be a strategic way to guarantee the consumer's health.",

      "abstract": "Here we introduce a new method aiming the immobilization of bioactive principles onto polymeric substrates, combining a surface activation and emulsion entrapment approach. Natural products with antimicrobial/antioxidant properties (essential oil from Syzygium aromaticum-clove and vegetal oil from Argania spinosa L-argan) were stabilized in emulsions with chitosan, a natural biodegradable polymer that has antimicrobial activity. The emulsions were laid on poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a synthetic biodegradable plastic from renewable resources, which was previously activated by plasma treatment. Bioactive materials were obtained, with low permeability for oxygen, high radical scavenging activity and strong inhibition of growth for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli bacteria. Clove oil was better dispersed in a more stable emulsion (no separation after six months) compared with argan oil. This leads to a compact and finely structured coating, with better overall properties. While both clove and argan oils are highly hydrophobic, the coatings showed increased hydrophilicity, especially for argan, due to preferential interactions with different functional groups in chitosan. The PLA films coated with oil-loaded chitosan showed promising results in retarding the food spoilage of meat, and especially cheese. Argan, and in particular, clove oil offered good UV protection, suitable for sterilization purposes. Therefore, using the emulsion stabilization of bioactive principles and immobilization onto plasma activated polymeric surfaces we obtained a bioactive material that combines the physical properties and the biodegradability of PLA with the antibacterial activity of chitosan and the antioxidant function of vegetal oils. This prevents microbial growth and food oxidation and could open new perspectives in the field of food packaging materials.",

Hatching eggs (n = 1280; mean weight = 58.64 ± 0.49 g) from a batch of 37-week-old broiler breeder hens of the CPK (Pesadão Vermelho) lineage were randomly distributed into four treatments in the preincubation phase. The treatments consisted of three different sanitization procedures (spraying with grain alcohol, spraying with clove essential oil, and fumigation with paraformaldehyde) and a control treatment (nonsanitized). The lengths of the embryos and one-day-old chicks (one of the parameters used to assess bird quality) were not significantly different among the treatments, with means of 15.30 ± 1.41 and 18.37 ± 0.76 mm, respectively. Body weight, body weight gain, feed consumption, and feed conversion rate in different rearing periods did not differ significantly among the treatments. However, there was a significant difference in the percentage of survivability during the initial period (1 to 28 days) among the treatments. In conclusion, clove essential oil treatment did not negatively affect the quality of embryos and one-day-old chicks or the performance of broilers."

Carcass characteristics, drip loss, and antioxidant activity were evaluated 24 h post mortem on longissimus thoracis, and the effects of aging (until 14 days) were evaluated for water losses (thawing/aging and cooking), texture, color, and lipid oxidation. RESULTS: The use of the natural additive blend did not modify (P > 0.05) carcass characteristics but did, however, modify body composition (P < 0.05). Drip losses were unaffected by the treatments tested (P > 0.05). There was an observed quadratic effect (P < 0.05) on losses from thawing/aging on the first day of storage. Regarding the effects of natural additives on cooking losses, there was a quadratic effect (P < 0.05) among the treatments on day 7 of aging. Differences between days of aging were only observed with control treatment. Shear force was similar among treatments on days 1 and 7 of aging. On day 14 a linear effect (P < 0.05) was observed. Also, a linear effect (P < 0.05) appeared on meat lightness, meat from the control group being clearer on day 1. No changes were observed in redness among treatments or days of storage (P > 0.05). Yellowness was not modified by the treatments (P > 0.05)but only by the days of storage in control and the lowest dosage used. CONCLUSION: The blend of natural additives has potential use in pasture feeding and could improve meat quality. However, doses should be adjusted. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Moreover, spices possess various antimicrobial properties with massive health benefits for the treatment and management of ailments and diseases. The present study was focused on three (3) aspects; (1) isolation and molecular identification of bacteria from the meat; (2) to determine the antimicrobial activity of the spices against the pathogens; (3) to assess the organoleptic properties of the spiced meat. A total of twelve (n = 12) spices evaluated against forty (n = 40) spoilage food-borne pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Enterococci spp.). The spice extracts were tested using disk diffusion method to determine the inhibition abilities. The results show that clove and black seed cumin extract exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against most pathogenic bacteria. Clove displayed the highest inhibition zone of 18 mm against E. coli (EcFwS1). Clove extract was the most inhibitor followed by black cumin, whereas extracts of thyme and cinnamon showed weak antibacterial activities against the tested strains. The most sensitive strain to spice extracts was Enterococcus spp. (EnFmL1) and the most resistant strain being E. coli. (EcFmS1 and EcFpL1). Untreated meat showed that E. coli and Enterococcus spp. count was 4.4 * 105 ± 3.4 * 105 and 2.2 * 105 ± 3.6 * 104 cfu/mL respectively after 7 days while the single dose of clove showed 5.4 * 104 ± 4.4 * 102 cfu/mL of E. coli and 1.7 * 105 ± 4.1 * 104 cfu/mL of Enterococcus spp. The organoleptic characteristics such as colour, texture, odour, pH, shape of the single dose of clove on the meat was overall acceptable."

A frequent cause of these losses is associated with the development of pathogenic fungi, such as those of the genus Fusarium. The effect of ozone on post-harvest garlic bulbs was evaluated. Garlic cloves inoculated with Fusarium proliferatum F21 and F22 strains, were exposed to a continuous gaseous ozone flow (2.14 μg m-3), during 4 days, 20 h a day. After ozone-treatment, the garlic samples were moved at 22 °C to mimic retail conditions (shelf life). The changes in several quality parameters such as fungal decay and aroma were evaluated on garlic samples, as whole bulbs, cloves with and without tunic, through a sensorial descriptive test, SPME analysis in GC/MS and microbiological approaches. The data collected showed that ozone treatment did not affect the aromatic profile of garlic. A significant detrimental effect of ozone treatment on garlic decay was observed. Our results encourage the use of gaseous ozone treatment for containing garlic fungal decay during its storage."

In the wait for an effective global immunization, the development of a specific therapeutic protocol to treat COVID-19 patients is clearly necessary as a short-term solution of the problem. Drug repurposing and herbal medicine represent two of the most explored strategies for an anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) is a well-known culinary spice that has been used for centuries in folk medicine in many disorders. Interestingly, traditional medicines have used clove since ancient times to treat respiratory ailments, whilst clove ingredients show antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Other interesting features are the clove antithrombotic, immunostimulatory, and antibacterial effects. Thus, in this review, we discuss the potential role of clove in the frame of anti-COVID-19 therapy, focusing on the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic effects of clove and its molecular constituents described in the scientific literature.",

Given the rise in antibiotic resistance, antibiotics-independent options are required to fight campylobacteriosis. Since the health-beneficial effects of clove have been known for long, we here analyzed the antimicrobial and immune-modulatory effects of clove essential oil (EO) during acute experimental campylobacteriosis. Therefore, microbiota-depleted interleukin-10 deficient (IL-10-/-) mice were perorally infected with C. jejuni and treated with clove EO via drinking water starting on day 2 post-infection. On day 6 post-infection, lower small- and large-intestinal pathogen loads could be assessed in clove EO as compared to placebo treated mice. Although placebo mice suffered from severe campylobacteriosis as indicated by wasting and bloody diarrhea, clove EO treatment resulted in a better clinical outcome and in less severe colonic histopathological and apoptotic cell responses in C. jejuni infected mice. Furthermore, lower colonic numbers of macrophages, monocytes, and T lymphocytes were detected in mice from the verum versus the placebo cohort that were accompanied by lower intestinal, extra-intestinal, and even systemic proinflammatory cytokine concentrations. In conclusion, our preclinical intervention study provides first evidence that the natural compound clove EO constitutes a promising antibiotics-independent treatment option of acute campylobacteriosis in humans."

Due to cytotoxic and anesthetic properties, the injection of clove oil or its component isoeugenol may be less detrimental to animal welfare. We investigated mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT), possible tissue alterations and horn growth for up to 12 weeks after injection of 1.5 mL clove oil (CLOV), isoeugenol (ISO) or saline (CON) or after hot-iron disbudding (BURN; with local anesthesia and sedation, n = 10/treatment). MNT was measured using von Frey filaments and a pressure algometer at four locations around the horn bud. There was a treatment*time point interaction (linear mixed model, p < 0.05). MNT decreased most strongly and for the longest time for BURN in most calves at least for 3 weeks. For ISO, the decrease was less distinct and most calves' values returned to baseline after 1-2 weeks. MNT in CLOV was intermediate, with decreased values up to 3 weeks in some animals. 12 weeks after the treatment, horn growth was prevented in about 50% of the horns in CLOV and ISO. Tissue alterations such as swellings of the eyelids often occurred in CLOV, but less so in ISO. Our results suggest that injection of isoeugenol causes less pain and thus seems to be beneficial compared to hot-iron disbudding, while clove oil was not advantageous. Regarding the effectiveness of isoeugenol to prevent horn growth, more studies are needed."

      "abstract": "Plant diseases reduce crop yield and quality, hampering the development of agriculture. Fungicides, which restrict chemical synthesis in fungi, are the strongest controls for plant diseases. However, the harmful effects on the environment due to continued and uncontrolled utilization of fungicides have become a major challenge in recent years. Plant-sourced fungicides are a class of plant antibacterial substances or compounds that induce plant defenses. They can kill or inhibit the growth of target pathogens efficiently with no or low toxicity, they degrade readily, and do not prompt development of resistance, which has led to their widespread use. In this study, the growth inhibition effect of 24 plant-sourced ethanol extracts on rice sprigs was studied. Ethanol extract of gallnuts and cloves inhibited the growth of bacteria by up to 100%. Indoor toxicity measurement results showed that the gallnut and glove constituents inhibition reached 39.23 μg/mL and 18.82 μg/mL, respectively. Extract treated rice sprigs were dry and wrinkled. Gallnut caused intracellular swelling and breakage of mitochondria, disintegration of nuclei, aggregation of protoplasts, and complete degradation of organelles in hyphae and aggregation of cellular contents. Protection of Rhizoctonia solani viability reached 46.8% for gallnut and 37.88% for clove in water emulsions of 1000 μg/mL gallnut and clove in the presence of 0.1% Tween 80. The protection by gallnut was significantly stronger than that of clove. The data could inform the choice of plant-sourced fungicides for the comprehensive treatment of rice sprig disease. The studied extract effectively protected rice sprigs and could be a suitable alternative to commercially available chemical fungicides. Further optimized field trials are needed to effectively sterilize rice paddies.",

      "abstract": "To screen the sensitive cell lines of active fraction from clove(AFC) on human colon cancer cells, investigate the effects of AFC on the cells proliferation and apoptosis as well as PI3 K/Akt/mTOR(phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling pathways involved, and reveal the mechanism of AFC for inducing apoptosis of human colorectal carcinoma cells. Cell counting kit-8(CCK-8) assay was used to detect the cytotoxic effect of different concentrations of AFC. AFC-induced apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. HCT116 cells were treated with AFC with or without pretreatment with insulin-like growth factor-Ⅰ(IGF-Ⅰ), and then the protein expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-9, poly ADP-ribose polymerase(PARP), PI3 K, p-PI3 K, Akt, p-Akt, mTOR and p-mTOR in PI3 K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. RESULTS:: showed that the most obvious inhibitory effect of AFC was on human colon cancer HCT116 cells, and the optimal AFC treatment time was 48 hours. After AFC treatment, typical apoptotic features such as nuclear chromatin concentration, nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic bodies appeared in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining showed that as compared with the control group, 50 and 100 μg·mL~(-1) AFC groups increased the apoptosis rate of HCT116 cells significantly(P&lt;0.001); AFC activated caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in a concentration-dependent manner. The protein expression levels of cleaved caspase-3/procaspase-3, cleaved PARP/PARP and caspase-9/β-actin after treatment of AFC(100 μg·mL~(-1)) were significantly different from those in the control group(P&lt;0.001). The relative protein expression of p-PI3 K, p-Akt and p-mTOR decreased in a concentration dependent manner, while Akt and mTOR showed no significant differences among groups. The ratios of p-PI3 K/PI3 K, p-Akt/Akt and p-mTOR/mTOR in the AFC groups(50 and 100 μg·mL~(-1)) were significantly lower than those in the control group(P&lt;0.01). Its combination with IGF-Ⅰ weakened the effect of AFC in inhibiting PI3 K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The ratios of p-Akt/Akt and p-mTOR/mTOR in the AFC+IGF-Ⅰ group were significantly enhanced as compared with the AFC group(P&lt;0.05). Apoptosis-related protein expression levels(cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP) in HCT116 cells treated with AFC+IGF-Ⅰ were also down regulated. As compared with the AFC group, the ratios of cleaved caspase-3/procaspase-3 and cleaved PARP/PARP in the AFC+IGF-Ⅰ group were significantly decreased(P&lt;0.01). In summary, AFC activated caspase-mediated cascades and induced HCT116 cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, which may be associated with the inhibition of the PI3 K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.",

The control group diet contained 0% clove seeds, whereas the treatment group diets contained up to 6% clove seeds. The chickens' final BW was significantly different between the treatments, which decreased linearly with increasing levels of clove seed inclusion. Broiler chickens fortified with clove seeds did not significantly affect the chickens' carcass characteristics and body composition. However, an increment in weights of carcass components (liver, heart, and gizzard) was observed in low clove seed levels. In addition, water-holding capacity, cooking loss percentages, and tenderness of the meat were improved owing to clove seed inclusion (1 or 2%) compared with the control group. Further studies are warranted to optimize the outstanding use of cloves toward broiler chicken performance enhancement and to produce a high quality of meat.",

      "abstract": "Tinea is a common superficial infection caused by keratinophylic fungi called dermatophytes. The objective of the current investigation was to develop and optimize a self-nanoemulsion drug delivery system (SENDDs) using clove oil loaded with naftifine (NF). Clove oil possesses good anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties that can support naftifine action. Box-Behnken designs were used to prepare plain and naftifine loaded SENDDs. The plain SENDDs were evaluated for their globule size. The medicated formulations (NF-CO-SENDDs) were characterized by measuring their globular size, ex vivo % NF permeated, level of interleukin-31 in rats, and antifungal activity. The optimum clove oil level was found to be 10-17%, while NF-CO-SENDDs formulations displayed globular sizes ranging from 119 to 310 nm. The statistical design confirmed the synergistic effect of clove oil and NF in the treatment of fungal infections, confirming that the anti-inflammatory effect of clove oil can counteract the side effects of NF. The optimized formulation composed of 14% clove oil, 12.5 mg Naftifine, and prepared with an Smix ratio equaling 3:1, exhibited good antifungal and anti-inflammatory activity, achieving up to 2-, 3-, 5.75-, and 2.74-fold increases in the amount of permeated NF, steady-state flux, permeability, and diffusion coefficients, respectively, compared with a commercial product. Moreover, the optimum formulation revealed an adequate zeta potential value of 28.31 ± 1.37 mV and showed reasonable stability with no or mild signs of skin sensitivity. Therefore, the designed nanoemulsions containing a combination of clove oil and naftifine could be considered promising delivery systems for the treatment of tinea.",

A total of 288 male broilers (Ross 308) were randomly divided into 6 dietary groups (4 replicates and 12 birds/replicate) and supplemented as follows: (I) Normal control (NC) received only basal diet under normal condition. The rest of the animals were challenged with heat and assigned to the following groups: (II) Heat stress control (HSC) received only basal diet; (III) Standard treatment (ST) received basal diet + vit E (100 ppm); (IV-VI) Herbal treatments (HT) received basal diet + 250, 350, and 450 ppm CEO. Heat stress could significantly decrease the animals' performance and induce severe oxidative/nitrosative stress. The HT at the middle dose could significantly improve body weight, body weight gain, and feed intake compared to HSC; however, none of the treatments had a significant effect on feed conversion ratio after inducing heat stress. Moreover, both ST and HT with a trend towards concentration-dependent fashion significantly contributed to normalization of oxidative/nitrosative biomarkers. It appears that CEO is a potential replacement for synthetic antioxidants in broiler diets.",

Their use in medical practice is recommended in view of their low toxicity, pharmacological properties and economic impact. This paper aims to test the antimicrobial effect of natural preparation based on clove, orange and bergamot essential oils on a wide range of microorganisms that cause infections in humans including: Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri, Candida parapsilosis, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenza. Three natural preparations such as one-component emulsions: clove (ECEO), bergamote (EBEO), and orange (EOEO), three binary: E(BEO/CEO), E(BEO/OEO), E(CEO/OEO) and a tertiary emulsion E(OEO/BEO/CEO) were obtained, characterized and tested for antimicrobial effects. Also, the synergistic/antagonistic effects, generated by the presence of the main chemical compounds, were studied in order to recommend a preparation with optimal antimicrobial activity. The obtained results underline the fact that the monocomponent emulsion ECEO shows antimicrobial activity, while EOEO and EBEO do not inhibit the development of the analyzed strains. In binary or tertiary emulsions E(BEO/CEO), E(CEO/OEO) and E(OEO/ BEO/CEO) the antimicrobial effect of clove oil is potentiated due to the synergism exerted by the chemical compounds of essential oils.",

To further clarify the antioxidant and anti-aging activities of CEO in vivo, the nematode C. elegans was used as an animal model. The results suggested that, chronic CEO treatment significantly extended the lifespan and promoted the production and health. As expected, CEO possessed antioxidant activities against the reactive oxygen species (ROS) through inducing the expression of SOD-3 or GST-4. Meanwhile, it was found that CEO treatment induced the DAF-16/FOXO nuclear translocation from the cytoplasm. Finally, the results indicated that CEO caused the apoptosis of germ cells in acep-1 and daf-16 dependent manner. Overall, our research suggests that CEO possesses antioxidant and anti-aging activities, and that DAF-16 may be essential for its biological functions.",

The disc-diffusion assay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed no changes in both the clear zone diameter and chemical composition of clove oil before and after the EAP treatment. Significant changes in cell membrane permeability and cell morphology resulting from the combined treatment of clove oil and EAP were evidenced by increased in UV absorption of cell supernatants, increased cell staining with propidium iodide, and changes in cell structure revealed by transmission electron microscopy. The synergistic bactericidal effects of clove oil and EAP against both pathogens were also observed in inoculated beef jerky, but the treatments were less effective against S. aureus, presumably due to thicker peptidoglycan layer. Experiments also demonstrated that the synergistic bactericidal effects between clove oil and EAP are due to clove oil increasing the susceptibility of the bacteria to subsequent EAP treatment, and does not involve alteration of the antibacterial activity of clove oil by EAP.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of new antibiotics that are effective against Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteralesis a research priority. Several essential oils (EOs) have displayed some antimicrobial activity and could potentially act as antibiotic adjuvants. Research in this area aims to develop new therapeutic alternatives to treat infections caused by these pathogens. MICs of different EOs were determined against A. baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Combined disk diffusion tests and checkerboard assays were used to study the synergy between the EOs and antibiotics. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICindex) was calculated in order to categorize the interaction. Time-kill assays were also performed. The EOs that displayed the highest levels of antimicrobial activity were clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) and thyme (Thymus zygis L.). Combined disk diffusion tests and checkerboard assays revealed synergy between these EOs and colistin. Addition of either clove or thyme EO decreased the MIC of colistin by 8- to 64-fold and 8- to 128-fold in the colistin-resistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae strains, respectively (FICindex ≤ 0.5, synergy). MICs were also reduced in the colistin-susceptible strains. Time-kill assays also indicated the strong activity of the combined therapy. In summary, the use of clove or thyme EO in combination with colistin could improve the efficacy of the antibiotic and significantly reduce the concentrations needed to inhibit growth of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae.",

      "abstract": "Emulsion formulations of essential oils are of major interest due to their relative biosafety, biocompatibility and good pharmacological potential. Their structural constituents (oil and water phase) facilitate ready solubilization of incorporated hydrophilic/lipophilic actives for their targeted delivery. In the present study, m5S cells were tested for their viability at various concentrations of clove oil and an alkyl polyglucoside emulsifier, viz., Montanov 202™. Thereafter, good cell viable concentrations of oil (10 %) and emulsifier (4%) were used at their optimised ratio (1:0.4) to formulate an oil in water emulsion using phase inversion technique followed by ultrasonication for particle size reduction. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of clove oil revealed eugenol (76.11 %) and eugenyl acetate (12.41 %) as major constituents. The formulated clove oil emulsion was then characterised with respect to its size, zeta potential, microscopic and thermal analysis and the presence of liquid crystals were observed in the same. It was further studied for its anti-inflammatory potential in female Wistar rats wherein topical treatment with the emulsion inhibited paw swelling induced by carrageenan model by 40-60% over 30-180 min compared to untreated animals. Similarly, the emulsion's wound healing potential was also significant with respect to wounds induced by both incision (wound breaking strength of 338.91 ± 5.02 g) and excision (95 % wound contraction by 16th day) model in these animals, with a re-epithelization period of 10.67 ± 1.67 days and results being comparable with diclofenac gel and neomycin cream (positive controls). Histopathology of the skin sections showed accelerated healing with early granular tissue and collagen formation in emulsion treated animals. It is hence envisaged that this clove oil emulsion can substitute chemical based topical products for anti-inflammatory and wound healing applications due to its biological constituents as well as because of the presence of liquid crystals in its formulation.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Clove essential oil is a phytochemical possessing a vast array of biological activities. Nevertheless, fabricating nano topical delivery systems targeted to augment the anti-inflammatory activity of the oil has not been investigated so far. Accordingly, in this study, controlled release nanoparticulate systems, namely nanoemulgel and nanofibers (NFs), of the oil were developed to achieve such goal. METHODS: The nanoemulsion was incorporated in the hydrogel matrix of mixed biopolymers - chitosan, guar gum and gum acacia - to formulate nanoemulsion-based nanoemulgel. Taguchi's model was adopted to evaluate the effect of independently controlled parameters, namely, the concentration of chitosan (X1), guar gum (X2), and gum acacia (X3) on different dependently measured parameters. Additionally, the nanoemulsion-based NFs were prepared by the electrospinning technique using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer. Extensive in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo evaluations of the aforementioned formulae were conducted. RESULTS: Both Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) established the complete dispersion of the nanoemulsion in the polymeric matrices of the prepared nanoemulgel and NFs. The ex vivo skin permeation data of clove essential oil from the prepared formulations showed that NFs can sustain its penetration through the skin comparably with nanoemulgel. Topical treatment with NFs (once application) and nanoemulgel (twice application) evoked a marvelous in vivo anti-inflammatory activity against croton oil-induced mouse skin inflammation model when compared with pure clove essential oil along with relatively higher efficacy of medicated NFs than that of medicated nanoemulgel. Such prominent anti-inflammatory activity was affirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that nanoemulsion-based nanoemulgel and nanoemulsion-based NFs could be introduced to the phytomedicine field as promising topical delivery systems for effective treatment of inflammatory diseases instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that possess adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly treated with conventional antibiotic which may lead to some serious side effects in the patients. Conventionally, medicinal plants, including clove, eucalyptus, and ginger, are used for the safe and effective treatment of several diseases. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim and objective of this study is to evaluate the combined antibacterial efficacy of medicinal plants (clove, eucalyptus, and ginger) and selected antibiotic and also combined efficacy of different plants extracts against clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of seven clinical isolates and one reference strain (PA01) of P. aeruginosa were included in this study. The antibacterial activity of crude methanol extracts of medicinal plants and selected antibiotics was screened using well-diffusion assay and their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the microdilution method. Combined efficacy of ceftazidime and plant extracts was tested using standard checkerboard method and different plant extracts were evaluated using broth macrodilution method. RESULTS: All of the seven clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa showed multidrug resistance pattern and were found highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin followed by ceftazidime and gentamicin. Clove exhibited better antibacterial activity as compared to eucalyptus and ginger. Synergistic interaction was found between ceftazidime and plants extracts against reference PA01 and clinical isolate 2. Highest two-fold reduction in MIC was found in the combination of clove-ginger against reference PA01 and clinical isolate 3. CONCLUSION: The selected medicinal plants are highly efficient for enhancing the antibacterial activity of antibiotic."
