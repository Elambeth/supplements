      "abstract": "The MDM2-p53 pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis, with its dysfunction contributing to approximately 50% of human malignancies. MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets the tumour suppressor p53 for degradation, thereby promoting uncontrolled cell growth in cancers. Inhibiting the MDM2-p53 interaction represents a promising therapeutic strategy for reactivating p53's tumour-suppressive functions. This study explored the potential of ibutamoren (IBU) as a novel inhibitor of MDM2. In silico analyses utilizing molecular modelling revealed that IBU has a low IC50 for MDM2 inhibition and favourably binds to the p53-binding pocket of MDM2. In vitro experiments demonstrated that IBU treatment reduced the viability of immortalized cancer cell lines with a functional MDM2-p53 pathway but not in cell lines where this pathway harboured damaging mutations. This trend was further supported by RT-qPCR analysis, which showed differential expression of two p53 target genes upon IBU treatment in cell lines with wild MDM2-p53 pathways but not in those harbouring damaging mutations. These findings provide preliminary evidence supporting IBU's anticancer activity, plausibly through the MDM2-p53 pathway, and suggest that further studies are warranted to explore its mechanism of action and potential development as a lead compound in oncology research.",

      "abstract": "Most elderly patients admitted for hip fracture suffer functional decline. Previous studies with MK-0677 in hip fracture patients suggested possible benefits to functional recovery. This is a randomized, double-blind study of 123 elderly hip fracture patients assigned to receive 25mg/day of MK-0677 (n = 62) or placebo (n = 61). Primary outcomes were a rank analysis of change during the study in objective functional performance measurements and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in blood. At 24-weeks, the mean stair climbing power increased by 12.5 W in the MK-0677 group (95% confidence interval (CI) = -10.95-35.88; p = 0.292) compared with placebo. Gait speed increased by a 0.7-score difference in the means (95% CI = 0.17-1.28; p = 0.011). There was no improvement in MK-0677 treated patients in several other functional performance measures. The MK-0677 group experienced fewer falls during the study compared to placebo and smaller number of patients who had any falls (p = 0.096). Levels of IGF-1 in treated patients increased by 51.4 ng/ml (95% CI = 34.42-68.44; p < 0.001) compared to placebo. Trial was terminated early due to a safety signal of congestive heart failure in a limited number of patients. In hip fracture patients treated with 25mg/day MK-0677, the increase in plasma IGF-1 levels was not paralleled by improvement in most functional performance measures. MK-0677 has an unfavorable safety profile in this patient population.",

      "abstract": "Ibutamoren mesylate (MK-0677), an orally active nonpeptide growth hormone (GH) secretagogue, stimulates GH release through a pituitary and hypothalamic receptor that is different from the GH-releasing hormone receptor. We evaluated the safety and tolerability and the GH-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) responses to two dosages of oral ibutamoren mesylate given to children with GH deficiency for 7 to 8 days. The patients, 18 prepubertal children (15 male, 3 female) with idiopathic GH deficiency, had a chronologic age of 10.6 +/- 0.8 years (mean +/- SD), bone age of 7.4 +/- 0.7 years, growth velocity < 10th percentile for age, height < 10th percentile for age, and a maximum GH response of < or = 10 microg/L to two different GH stimulation tests. The children were assigned as follows to one of three treatment groups with ibutamoren mesylate: 0.2 mg/kg per day for 7 days (days 1-7 or 8-14) and matching placebo for the alternate 7 days (groups I and II, respectively) or 0.8 mg/kg per day for 7 days (days 8-14, group III). On day 15 all patients received an 0.8-mg/kg dose of ibutamoren mesylate. Patients in groups I and II were studied first to assess safety at the low dose before advancement to the high dose. Hormonal profiles were evaluated on day -1 (baseline) and day 15, and the results were expressed as the change from baseline within each group. After administration of ibutamoren mesylate 0.8 mg/kg for 8 days (group III), the median increases (on day 15) from baseline were as follows: 3.8 microg/L (range, 0 to 34.3) for serum GH peak concentration (P = .001), 4.3 microg x h/L (range, 1.3 to 35.6) for the GH area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 hours (AUC(0-8)) (P < .001), 12 microg/L (range, -4 to 116) for serum IGF-I (P = .01), and 0.4 microg/L (range, -0.9 to 1.5) for serum IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) (P = .01). There was no change in serum prolactin, glucose, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyrotropin, peak serum cortisol, and insulin concentrations or 24-hour urinary free cortisol after administration of 0.8 mg/kg per day of ibutamoren mesylate for 8 days. We conclude that short-term administration of ibutamoren mesylate can increase GH, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 levels in some children with GH deficiency. Thus this compound is applicable for testing its effect on growth velocity.",
