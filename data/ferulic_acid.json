      "abstract": "In this study, ferulic acid (FA) was conjugated with biotin via a disulfide bond to improve its anticancer activity. The resulting conjugate (FA-SS-Bio) was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and exhibited an amorphous structure, in contrast to the crystalline nature of FA. FA-SS-Bio demonstrated accelerated drug release under reductive and oxidative conditions. Biotinylation significantly increased cell uptake of the drug in biotin receptor (BR)-positive HeLa and MCF-7 cells, as confirmed by cellular uptake studies and molecular docking, which revealed strong biotin-BR interactions. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of FA-SS-Bio was significantly improved, with IC50 values that were 2.94-fold and 2.95-fold lower than those of free FA against HeLa and MCF-7 cells, respectively. BR blockade with biotin reduced FA-SS-Bio cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner, confirming biotin-mediated targeting. Apoptosis assays showed enhanced FA-induced apoptosis due to biotin and disulfide bonds. FA-SS-Bio demonstrated excellent blood compatibility, with a hemolysis rate below 0.5 %, compared to ∼1.5 % for FA. Additionally, FA-SS-Bio exhibited higher cell viability in MCF-10 A cells than in cancer cells, highlighting its favorable safety profile. These findings provide a novel perspective on the design of prodrug conjugates for improved cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetes pose significant health challenges globally, necessitating the development of innovative medication strategies to improve outcomes in affected populations. This research aimed to determine the defensive impact of ferulic acid (FA) against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic rats. METHODS: A group of male rats was partitioned into five distinct groups: control group, diabetic group, diabetic + MI, diabetic + MI + 20 mg/kg FA, and diabetic + MI + 40 mg/kg FA. The experimental groups received isoproterenol (ISO) subcutaneously at a dosage of 50 mg/kg body weight for two consecutive days. RESULTS: The outcome was severe cardiac toxicity, as shown by changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm and a substantial increase in blood cardiac enzymes such as creatinine kinase (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Additionally, there was a surge in inflammatory cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and a disruption of the antioxidant system, evidenced by a rise in malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Moreover, there was a rise in cardiac receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Treatment with FA with escalating dosages of 20 and 40 mg/kg b.w. effectively mitigated changes in serum cardiac enzymes and improved the cellular architecture, which was evaluated by histopathological examination. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in a dose-dependent manner, FA successfully showed a cardioprotective effect against ISO-induced cardiac toxicity in diabetic rats, as shown by the improvement in ECG findings, normalization of serum cardiac biomarkers, and augmentation of the endogenous antioxidant system. Therefore, the aforementioned data indicate that ferulic acid may potentially have a protective effect on MI patients who have diabetes mellitus."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease renamed as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and a global health issue that causes excessive liver fat deposition without alcohol usage. Basic fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Role of research is vital due to the multifaceted, complex pathophysiology and the increasing incidence of a sedentary lifestyle. Computational network pharmacology, docking and dynamics studies of saroglitazar and ferulic acid with human ketohexokinase (KHK) were conducted to propose potential MASLD management. METHOD: Utilized computational methodologies were utilized to examine binding interactions of saroglitazar (compound identifier (CID): 60151560) and ferulic acid (CID: 445858) with human ketohexokinase (KHK: P50053, Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 6W0W). Active site analysis was done by using the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) server (Collaborative Drug Discovery, Burlingame, California) and BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2019 (Dassault Systèmes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France). The best PDB complex was used for molecular dynamics simulation and trajectory analysis on 100 ns, and functional associations were checked based on network analysis using the Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) server (STITCH Consortium (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany). RESULTS: Human ketohexokinase (KHK) protein (UniProt ID: P50053) was obtained. Additional KHK PDB Structure (6W0W) was retrieved for docking calculation. PubChem Database 2 Structure-Data File (SDF) files (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), U.S. National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland), ferulic acid (CID: 445858) and saroglitazar (CID: 60151560) were used as ligands. Active site residues were identified using the CDD server and BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2019. Further, identified active site residues, i.e., Arg108, Trp225, Glu227, Gly229, Ala230, Pro246, Pro247, Val250, Thr253, Gly257, Cys282, Gly286, and Cys289 were used as potential active site for docking. D. E. Shaw Research Molecular Dynamics (DESMOND, Schrödinger, Inc., New York) was used for molecular dynamics simulation and trajectory analysis equilibrated after 40 ns in best-docked complex (saroglitazar (CID: 60151560) and KHK; binding energy: -21 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION: The study shows that saroglitazar and ferulic acid are potent KHK inhibitors for metabolic diseases, including MASLD, suggesting multi-target treatments."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In a global context of escalating multimorbidity, characterized by the co-occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD), endothelial dysfunction (ED), and gastrointestinal dysregulation (GD), the quest for effective treatments has become paramount. Central to these interconnected conditions is oxidative stress (OS), a pivotal factor that has been extensively studied yet remains inadequately addressed. This study introduces Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS) and its absorbed component ferulic acid (FA), a potent antioxidant derived from medicinal plants, as a novel therapeutic approach with the unique ability to counter the multifaceted effects of acute forced swimming (AFS)-induced depression, ED, and GD. Unlike traditional single-disease-focused studies, our research explores the synergistic effects of CSS and FA across these interrelated disorders, offering a groundbreaking perspective. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to evaluate CSS and FA in treating depression-related multimorbidity triggered by AFS and to uncover the shared underlying mechanisms of FA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A depression-like model in rats was induced by AFS, and an OS model was established in endothelial cells (ECs) through hydrogen peroxide treatment. We investigated the effects of CSS and FA on MDD, ED, and GD in rats and OS levels in ECs. Our assessments included hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, biochemical assays, and behavioral studies. We conducted an integrated analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The identification of relevant targets was confirmed through Western blotting (WB), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), molecular docking studies, and an extensive literature review. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that CSS and FA not only significantly mitigate AFS-induced abnormalities in the open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), and related behaviors such as gastric emptying and intestinal transit in rats but also ameliorate depression, ED, GD, inflammation and OS-related biomarker levels, alongside HE staining in gastric sinus and aorta slices. The study also highlights that FA can influence OS and endothelial function in ECs. Moreover, a combined multi-omics analysis unveiled several OS-related pathways, including the mTOR and p53 signaling pathways. Our research elucidates that the Ghrl-Edn1/Mecp2/P-mTOR/Vegfa-associated OS signaling pathway is pivotal in countering AFS-induced multimorbidity, expanding beyond the conventional disease-specific focus. CONCLUSIONS: This pioneering study underscores capability of CSS and FA to tackle AFS-induced multimorbidity concurrently and intricately details FA's antioxidative mechanisms within ECs. The insights gleaned offer a novel perspective on FA's role in multimorbidity regulation and its potential to modulate OS, especially in the complex environment of ECs. Given the urgent global health challenges, our research positions FA as a promising therapeutic contender, advocating for a paradigm shift in multimorbidity management.",

      "abstract": "This study explores the antifungal properties of ferulic acid (FA), ferulic acid methylester (FAM), and ferulic acid ethylester (FAE), against Botryosphaeria dothidea (B. dothidea), and their effects on the postharvest quality (decay rate, weight loss rate, total soluble solids, titratable acids, firmness, respiration rate) of \"Hongyang\" kiwifruit. The results demonstrated that FAE exhibited a stronger in vitro inhibitory effect on B. dothidea than FA and FAM, and offered superior preservation of kiwifruit quality after harvest. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that B. dothidea mycelium treated with FA, FAM, and FAE showed altered surface morphology, with signs of plasmolysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further confirmed that FAE caused significant damage to the cell membrane and organelles of B. dothidea. Additional analyses using propidium iodide (PI) and calcofluor fluorescence white (CFW) staining, conductivity tests, and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) assays demonstrated that FA, FAM, and FAE treatments compromised cell membrane integrity. In addition, FAE treatment reduced the decay rate of kiwifruit, delayed the softening process and respiratory peak, maintained firmness, and prolonged antioxidant enzyme activity, preserving the fruit's quality over time. These findings suggest that FAE is a potent antifungal agent against B. dothidea with potential applications as an eco-friendly solution for controlling postharvest soft rot in kiwifruit. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study explores the antifungal properties of ferulic acid (FA), ferulic acid methylester (FAM), and ferulic acid ethylester (FAE), against Botryosphaeria dothidea, and their effects on the postharvest quality of \"Hongyang\" kiwifruit.

      "abstract": "Cutaneous tissue is one of the main targets of outdoor stressors, and nowadays, the effect of pollution on skin conditions and premature skin ageing has been well correlated, although the exact effect that different pollutants have on the skin has not been well defined, especially when compared to other stressors. Among the air pollutants, UV radiation and particulate matter (PM) have been found among the most aggressive in terms of skin damage, inducing oxinflammatory responses, promoting degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and compromising the cutaneous defensive barrier. Topical application of technologies able to prevent oxidative damage is still one of the best approaches to protect our skin, and considering the well-known antioxidant network, application of an antioxidant mixture is more recommended than a single compound. In the present study, human skin explants were exposed every day for 4 days to diesel particles (DEE) or to UV after the daily pre-treatment with a topical application of a commercially available antioxidant mixture (AOX Mix), containing 15% ascorbic acid, 0.5% ferulic acid and 1% tocopherol. Oxidative stress markers such as 4-hydroxynonenal, skin barrier proteins such as involucrin, filaggrin, claudin-1 and desmocollin-1, resilience markers such as elastin and tropoelastin, and the levels of Type I and Type III collagens were assessed. Topical application was able to prevent most of the damage induced by the outdoor stressors, confirming that daily protection is needed to prevent cutaneous premature ageing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Yerba maté (YM), a traditional herbal beverage made from Ilex paraguariensis, contains bioactive compounds like polyphenols and alkaloids known for their metabolic benefits. This study investigates YM's incretin effects, focusing on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). Methods: Male and female C57BL/6 mice were supplemented with YM for four weeks. Post-supplementation, GLP-1 and GIP gene expression levels were analyzed in jejunal mucosa, and plasma hormone concentrations were measured. Additionally, in vitro experiments were conducted using GLUTag L-cells to evaluate the direct effects of YM and its metabolites, including ferulic acid and dihydroferulic acid, on GLP-1 secretion. Gene expression analysis involved quantitative real-time PCR, while hormone levels were assessed via ELISA. RESULTS: YM supplementation significantly increased GLP-1 gene expression and plasma GLP-1 levels compared to controls, with no changes observed in GIP expression or plasma levels. Direct treatment of GLUTag L-cells with YM did not enhance GLP-1 secretion. However, dihydroferulic acid, a microbial metabolite of ferulic acid, markedly stimulated GLP-1 production in L-cells, highlighting a role of gut-mediated metabolism in YM's incretin effects. CONCLUSIONS: YM selectively upregulates GLP-1 pathways without affecting GIP, likely through gut-mediated mechanisms. These findings suggest YM as a promising nutraceutical for incretin modulation and metabolic disorder management. Further studies should explore the interplay between YM, the gut microbiota, and incretin pathways to fully realize its therapeutic potential.",

The objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of ferulic acid as a substitute for nitrites in the elaboration of dried meat. Four treatments were evaluated: dried meat without nitrites or ferulic acid, (control treatment), dried meat with nitrites, dried meat with 0.05% of ferulic acid, and dried meat with 0.1% of ferulic acid. The antioxidant activity, lipid oxidation, and microbiological quality were evaluated throughout the dried meat shelf life. The protein, fat, and ash content was not different between the treatments with nitrites and ferulic acid (p > 0.05) and all values were within the ranges established for these nutrients. Regarding the moisture content, although there was a difference between treatments (p < 0.05), the values found were within the reported range (5-15%) in dried meat. Treatment with nitrites had the highest sodium content (p < 0.05), although all treatments surpass the daily consumption of sodium recommended by the World Health Organization. In addition, color differences would not be noticeable to the human eye. Treatments with ferulic acid exhibited the highest (p < 0.05) antioxidant activity and the lowest lipid oxidation and total aerobic mesophile counts. Finally, the change in the formulation of dried meat using ferulic acid instead of nitrites was not perceptible to panelists in sensory evaluation. These findings suggest that the incorporation of ferulic acid, when added to dried meat, can improve its oxidative stability and increase its antioxidant activity. In conclusion, the use of ferulic acid at a concentration of 0.1% is recommended because, at this concentration, the antioxidant activity was greater, and the oxidation was below the threshold of perceived rancidity. However, further research is needed to study the effect of nitrite substitution using ferulic acid in combination with other potential natural antioxidants."

Inflammation was induced by injecting formalin (50 µL) into the right hind paw of mice. The animals were treated with different doses of TFA (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg, p.o.). The vehicle and ETO (35 mg/kg, p.o.) were provided as positive and negative control, respectively. ETO also served combined with TFA to evaluate the modulatory activity. The licking behavior was counted for the early and late phases, whereas the paw edema diameter was measured by using a slide caliper. All treatment was continued for 7 days until the edema was totally minimized to determine the inflammation's recovery capability for a specific group. Different computed and web tools were used to estimate molecular binding affinity, binding interactions, and pharmacokinetics. The findings demonstrated that TFA significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the onset of licking and reduced the number of licks compared to vehicle group. TFA also showed a significant (p < 0.05) diminished in paw edema and complete recovered of the edema after 5 days of treatment indicating the anti-inflammatory effects. However, TFA with ETO notably diminished the anti-inflammatory effects of ETO by enhancing paw edema diameter and licking number. TFA also expressed elevated binding affinity of -7.5 and -6.5 kcal/mol toward nitric oxide (NO) synthase and COX-1, respectively. In conclusion, TFA exerted anti-inflammatory effects and reduces anti-inflammatory capability of ETO."

FA cross-linked with CH-CS-RCA through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions, improving mechanical properties and water resistance of the film. FA significantly enhanced the color rendering and storage stability of the film, resulting in pronounced color change in pH 7.0-8.0 range and the increase of ammonia (NH3) sensitivity of the film. Owing to high bioactivity of FA, the radical-scavenging and bacterial inhibition rates of the CH-CS-RCA-FA film were significantly higher than those of the CH-CS-RCA film. In salmon preservation, the shelf-life of salmon after CH-CS-RCA-FA coating treatment was extended from 6 d to 12 d at 4 °C. The freshness indication sensitivity of the CH-CS-RCA-FA film was higher than that of CH-CS-RCA, especially at the medium-fresh stage. Therefore, this work provides an effective idea for the optimization of anthocyanin-based intelligent packaging systems.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by oxidative stress and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Ferulic acid and quinic acid, two phenolic compounds, are thought to have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of ferulic acid and quinic acid in rats with acetic acid (AA)-induced ulcerative colitis. To this end, 64 Wistar rats were randomly divided into eight groups, each consisting of eight rats. AA was administered intrarectally to induce ulcerative colitis. Ferulic acid (20, 40, and 60 mg/kg), quinic acid (10, 30, 60, and 100 mg/kg), and dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) were received daily for five consecutive days. Then, the macroscopic and histopathological changes in the colon tissue were examined. Finally, the tissue levels of heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) mRNA expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) were measured using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods, respectively. AA-induced ulcerative colitis in rats was associated with edema and severe damage to the epithelium, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the presence of ulcers in the colon tissue. The results showed that rats who were administered AA showed a decrease in the expression of HO-1, Nrf2, and NQO1 and increased protein levels of TNF-α and IL-1β than the control group. Rats were administered ferulic acid, quinic acid and, dexamethasone significantly improved histopathological indices. The expression of HO-1, Nrf2, and NQO1 were upregulated by 60 mg/kg of ferulic acid, 60 and100 mg/kg of quinic acid and, 2 mg/kg of dexamethasone treatment compared to the ulcerative colitis group. The protein levels of TNF-α and IL-1β dose-dependently decreased by ferulic acid and quinic acid treatment compared to the ulcerative colitis group. Ferulic acid and quinic acid effectively reduce inflammation and mucosal damage in rats with ulcerative colitis, especially when administered in high doses. The possible mechanism of anti-inflammatory response by ferulic acid and quinic acid may involve the activating of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

Ferulic acid (FA) is a natural product that may inhibit fatty acids' binding to FABP3, preventing their toxicity. It is aimed to evaluate the consequences of maternal feeding on high-fat, high fructose diet (HFFD) and the role of FA on the offspring. Four-week-old female rats were fed HFFD for 9 weeks prior to and throughout gestation and lactation to develop T2D. A group of them received 50 mg/kg FA daily. Offspring were sampled on gestational day 18 (GD18), and postnatal days (PND) 3 and 30. HFFD increased offspring's blood glucose, insulin, Homa-IR, HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, intrahepatic and intra-insular lipid droplets. The mechanism of islet inflammation and apoptosis, detected by Il-1b and cleaved caspase3, involved the nuclear translocation of NFκB p65. Maternal HFFD caused developmental retardations in offspring's ovaries, testes, kidney and liver. Coupling FA treatment with the maternal HFFD maintained normoglycemia, lipidemia, and healthy islets, and prevented developmental retardations. FA administration to T2D mothers revealed positive effects on the offspring that is related to its direct protective effect on pancreatic β-cells.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic widely used in cancer therapy. However, its cytotoxic properties affect both cancerous and healthy cells. Combining doxorubicin with antioxidants such as ferulic acid reduces its side effects, while simultaneously enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. The low bioavailability of these drugs demonstrate that drug delivery carriers are required to enable the target site to be accessed. The doxorubicin and ferulic acid-loaded liposome composed of HSPC, Cholesterol, and DSPE-mPEG2000 (55:40:5 molar ratio) was prepared by thin film hydration method. The findings indicate that the encapsulation of ferulic acid had an impact on liposome characteristics, i.e., increasing the particle size of Lipo-DOX from 134.5 ± 4.8 nm to 154.1 ± 5.2 nm for Lipo DOX-FA, increasing the zeta potential of Lipo-DOX from - 16.04 ± 2.59 to 0.2 ± 0.0 mV for Lipo DOX-FA, and reducing the entrapment efficiency percentage of Lipo-DOX from 88.30 ± 1.89% to 85.99 ± 3.02% for Lipo DOX-FA. The infrared spectra of Lipo DOX-FA exhibited shifted absorption bands, indicating the interaction between the carboxyl group of ferulic acid and the choline polar head of phospholipid. Moreover, changes to the DSC thermogram were observed following the incorporation of ferulic acid into the liposome, while the Lipo DOX-FA exhibited a relatively rapid drug release compared to Lipo DOX suggesting a slightly shorter period necessary to attain both therapeutic efficacy and the maintenance of a stable drug encapsulation in the systemic circulation. An in vitro study of LLC and HeLa cells showed that the IC50 values of Lipo DOX-FA were 0.70 µg/mL and 1.56 µg/mL, while the CC50 value in normal HEK cells was 6.50 µg/mL. This study suggested that while co-loading FA into Lipo DOX reduced the IC50 value, indicating enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells, it had no effect on DOX liposome cytotoxicity in normal HEK cells.",

Methods: Ferulic acid nanoemulsion developed with lemongrass oil is investigated in diabetic wound healing. Further nanoemulsion is incorporated into 1% carbopol® 934 to obtain the DLMGO-G. Nanoemulsion was characterized for particle size, and polydispersity index (PDI) was obtained by Malvern Zetasizer (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern, AL, USA), and morphology by TEM (JEM 1400, JOEL, Akishima, Japan). Furthermore, in vitro cell line and in vivo studies were carried out. Results: The developed nanoemulsion showed a globule size of 28.04 ± 0.23 nm and PDI of 0.07 ± 0.01. The morphology of nanoformulations by TEM confirmed the spherical and uniform nature. Further, the nanoformulation in in vitro cell line experiments revealed that the IC50 value was increased by 1.52 times compared to the drug solution. The treatment groups have shown that fibroblast morphologies were spindle-shaped, suggesting that nanoformulation was compatible with the cells and developed normally on nanoformulation. It also reduced ROS with improved internalization more than the control group. The in vitro wound healing model also revealed that nanoformulation had better wound healing activity. In the in vivo diabetic wound studies on male SD rats, the levels of inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-22, and IL-1β declined significantly when treated with DLMGO-G. IL-10 levels significantly increased compared to the diseased group, and MMP-9 levels were remarkably decreased compared to the diseased group. Furthermore, histopathological studies showed the regeneration and granulation of tissues. Conclusions: Thus, these findings indicate that FA-loaded nanoemulgel greatly accelerates the healing of wounds in diabetic rats."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Increased plasma-free fatty acid (FFA) induced by obesity can trigger insulin resistance and it is a significantly dangerous constituent in the progression of diabetes. Although ferulic acid has various physiological functions, no studies have examined ferulic acid's effects on insulin-resistant muscle cells. This study investigated the effect of ferulic acid on improving palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance in L6 skeletal muscle cells. METHODS: Palmitic acid induces insulin resistance by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRS-1tyr and stimulating the phosphorylation of IRS-1ser in diabetes. Thus, palmitic acid (0.75 mM) was used as an insulin resistance inducer and ferulic acid was treated at various concentrations (2, 5, 10, and 20 uM) in L6 skeletal muscle cells. RESULTS: Palmitic acid significantly reduced the cell viability of L6 skeletal muscle cells, whereas ferulic acid treatment significantly increased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Palmitic acid significantly reduced glucose uptake due to insulin resistance in the muscle cells; however, ferulic acid treatment remarkably increased glucose uptake. Ferulic acid promoted the phosphorylation of IRS-1tyr that palmitic acid inhibited, while also suppressing the palmitic acid-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1ser. Ferulic acid activated PI3K and then stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt, which increased PM-GLUT4 expression, thereby stimulating glucose uptake into insulin-resistant muscle cells. Ferulic acid also increased glycogen synthesis by phosphorylating GSK3β via the Akt pathway. Additionally, ferulic acid significantly promoted phosphorylation of AMPK, enhancing PM-GLUT4 levels and glucose uptake. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ferulic acid may improve palmitate-induced insulin resistance by regulating IRS-1/ Akt and the AMPK pathway in L6 skeletal muscle cells."

      "abstract": "To achieve effective long-term synergistic treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with probiotics, we developed a versatile inulin/trans-ferulic acid/silk sericin nanoparticles-nourished probiotic complex. Inulin/TFA/SS nanoparticles were fabricated by inulin, trans-ferulic acid (TFA), and silk sericin (SS), and then loaded onto the surface of poly-l-lysine (PLL) and poly-glutamic acid (PGA)-coated Bifidobacterium longum (BL) to obtain BL@PLL-PGA-Inulin/TFA/SS NPs (BL@PP-NPs). This design simultaneously endowed the complex with excellent gastrointestinal resistance, antioxidant, and anti-inflammation abilities. Moreover, the inulin in the nanoparticles acts as a prebiotic, promoting the Bifidobacterium's rapid proliferation to exert effects within a short period. Compared with uncoated BL, BL@PP-NPs exhibited excellent gastric acid tolerance and up to 31.32-fold colonic colonization, and the ROS scavenging and proliferative capacity were increased by 5.61- and 1.39-fold, respectively. In a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, the components of Inulin/TFA/SS NPs synergized with probiotics to efficiently treat IBD by attenuating oxidative stress, decreasing inflammation, repairing intestinal barrier, and promoting the rapid proliferation of probiotics to reverse gut microbial disorders. Collectively, food-grade BL@PP-NPs represent a novel approach to probiotic modification that offers an effective, safe, and synergistic therapy for IBD.",

The goal of this study was to see whether ferulic acid has any neuroprotective benefits on the cerebellum of rats that have Parkinson's disease brought on by rotenone poisoning. A total of twenty-four male albino rats, in good condition, weighed between 200 and 250 g and nine to ten weeks old, were employed in the investigation. The control group received 1 ml of sunflower oil intraperitoneally (i.p.) each day. Rats' motor performance was considerably worse when given rotenone than it was in the control group. Rats given Ferulic Acid (FA) showed a substantial drop in the amount of glutathione (GSH) in the cerebellum. Moreover, the injection of FA resulted in a significant reduction in the optical density (OD) of the immune-positive reaction for α-synuclein, and the area percentage of BCL-2 and NF-kB immunological positive response. FA therapy, surprisingly, enhanced the OD of TH immunopositive response and apoptotic regulators (BCL2) in the cerebellum. Furthermore, FA boosted BCL2 expression, confirming the antiapoptotic effects of FA. Based on these results, FA is probably a good candidate to treat neurodegenerative diseases brought on by long-term exposure to rotenone.",

      "abstract": "trans-Ferulic acid (TFA), a bioactive compound found in many plants, has been recognized for its diverse pharmacological activities, including potential neurological benefits. Previous studies suggest that TFA exerts anxiolytic effects via GABAergic pathways. This study aimed to investigate the sedative effects of TFA and its possible molecular mechanisms through in vivo and in silico approaches. Adult Swiss mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7): control (vehicle), standard (DZP: Diazepam at 3 mg/kg, p.o.), three test groups (TFA at 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg, p.o.), and a combination group (TFA: 50 mg/kg with DZP: 3 mg/kg, p.o.). Thirty minutes post-treatment, thiopental sodium (TS) at 40 mg/kg was administered to induce sedation, and latency as well as duration of sleep, were observed for up to 4 h. In silico studies were conducted with GABAA receptor subunits (α1 and β2) to elucidate the possible molecular interactions. The results demonstrated that TFA significantly reduced latency and extended sleep duration in a dose-dependent manner compared to the control. Additionally, TFA combined with DZP further significantly (p < 0.001) enhanced these effects. In silico analysis revealed that TFA and DZP exhibited strong binding affinities with the GABAA receptor subunits (α1 and β2) in the identical binding sites, with binding energies of -6.8 and - 8.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Collectively, TFA exerted a mild sedative effect in TS-induced sleeping mice and modulated the activity of DZP, likely through interactions with GABAA receptors. TFA showed promising activity as a potential candidate for managing sleep disorders such as insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Radiation-induced intestinal injury is a common complication of radiotherapy for abdominal and pelvic malignancies. Due to its rapid proliferation, the small intestine is particularly sensitive to radiation, making it a critical factor limiting treatment. Ferulic acid (FA), a derivative of cinnamic acid, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-radiation properties. In this study, we established a mouse model of radiation-induced intestinal injury using a dose of 11 Gy at a rate of 96.62 cGy/min. Our findings indicate that FA's protective effects against radiation-induced intestinal injury may be mediated through the parkinsonism-associated deglycase (DJ-1) nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Sirt1) nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3). FA was found to mitigate changes in oxidative stress indices and inflammatory factors induced by radiation, as well as to attenuate radiation-induced pathological alterations in the small intestine. Furthermore, FA enhanced the expression of DJ-1 and Nrf2 at both the transcriptional and protein levels, inhibited NLRP3 protein fluorescence intensity, and reduced the expression of NLRP3, interleukin-18 (IL-18), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Additionally, FA suppressed the transcription and translation of NF-κB, NLRP3, cysteine-aspartic acid protease-1 (Caspase-1), IL-18, and IL-1β by upregulating Sirt1, thereby alleviating radiation-induced inflammatory injury in the small intestine. Thus, FA holds promise as an effective therapeutic agent for ameliorating radiation-induced intestinal injury.",

      "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation-triggered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a primary contributor to apoptosis in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs), which can ultimately result in cataract formation. The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1) pathway, a fundamental oxidative stress regulation mechanism, plays a crucial role in the development of cataracts. Ferulic acid (FA), recognized for its potent antioxidant properties can activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway to mitigate oxidative damage and cell apoptosis. In this study, we have demonstrated the protective effects of FA in reducing UVA-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in HLECs through the modulation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, as evidenced by both cellular and animal experiments. HLECs and Lens were exposed to 10 J/cm2 UVA radiation with or without prior treatment with FA. We found that UVA radiation increased oxidative damage and cell apoptosis in HLECs, ultimately leading to opacification of rat lenses, while FA was able to attenuate both oxidative damage and cell apoptosis in HLECs and reduce the degree of lens opacification. FA upregulated the expression of antioxidant response factors of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and downregulated the expression of apoptosis-related genes in HLECs, as demonstrated by Western blot and RT-qPCR analyses. We also found that UVA radiation increased the degree of demethylation of the Keap1 promoter in HLECs, whereas FA reduced the level of Keap1 promoter demethylation as determined by DNA sequencing. Additionally, UVA upregulated the expression of DNA active demethylase of the Keap1 promoter in HLECs, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b, as shown by immunofluorescence, Western blot, and RT-qPCR, however, FA attenuated the activity of the passive demethylase TET1 in addition to the active demethylases. These results demonstrated that UVA radiation can cause oxidative damage, cell apoptosis, and rat lens opacification by increasing the demethylation of the Keap1 promoter in lens epithelial cells. Conversely, FA was shown to reduce oxidative damage, inhibit cell apoptosis, and decrease rat lens opacification by increasing the methylation of the Keap1 promoter. These findings suggest that FA could be therapeutically beneficial in preventing and mitigating cataracts induced by UVA radiation.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the awareness of healthier lifestyles among consumers has driven to an increased interest in more natural, nutritious, and low-processed foods. Ferulic acid, one of the most abundant phenolic acids in plants, has demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities and a range of biomedical effects, including antioxidant, antiallergic, hepatoprotective, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic, among others. The objective of this work was to study the antilisterial effect of ferulic acid (FA, 1500 mg/L) on fresh, ready-to-eat orange (FOJ) and apple (FAJ) juices and evaluate its effect on product quality. The results showed that FA reduced the Listeria monocytogenes population after 9 days of storage at 4 °C, but no effect on the indigenous microbiota was observed. The titratable acidity and color significantly changed. The antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content significantly increased with the addition of FA, being at least two times greater in fortified juices. FAJ and FOJ containing FA were scored lower (6.8 and 5.7 on a 9-point hedonic scale, respectively) than their respective controls. Overall, our results demonstrated that FA treatment could be a useful strategy to maintain the safety of fresh apple and orange juices and increase the antioxidant activity and phenolic content. The potential industrial applications and health benefits of the fortification of fruit juices with FA should be further explored."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by flushing, erythema, papules, and pustules on the central face. It affects patient appearance and is noted for its chronicity, recurrence, and resistance to treatment. Effective rosacea treatment requires repairing the skin barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting vasoconstriction. AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of topical ferulic acid in treating papulopustular rosacea and its impact on skin barrier function. METHODS: Sixty patients with mild to moderate papulopustular rosacea were selected from the Department of Dermatology at the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong Second Medical University between January 2023 and December 2023. Patients were randomly assigned to either a control group or an observation group, with 30 patients in each group. The observation group applied ferulic acid solution to the affected areas, while the control group used normal saline, both twice daily for 6 weeks. Both groups also received 0.1 g doxycycline hydrochloride tablets orally once daily. Skin lesions and skin barrier function were assessed using VISIA imaging and self-rating scales before and during treatment, and adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: After 6 weeks, both skin lesion assessments and self-assessment scores improved significantly from baseline, with greater improvement in the observation group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Indicators of skin barrier function and VISIA imaging results demonstrated the efficacy of ferulic acid in treating rosacea. The total effective rate was significantly higher in the observation group (80.00%) compared to the control group (63.33%) (p < 0.05). In the observation group, nine patients (30.00%) experienced a greasy sensation initially, one patient (3.33%) reported tingling and itching, and no serious adverse reactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ferulic acid is effective as an adjuvant treatment for papulopustular rosacea, significantly improving skin lesions and repairing skin barrier function with minimal adverse reactions.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by abnormal levels of lipids and lipoproteins in the plasma, posing significant health risks. Ferulic acid (FA) is an organic acid with therapeutic properties for diabetes and hyperlipidemia. METHODS: To explore biomarkers for FA treatment of hyperlipidemia and elucidate the mechanisms of lipid-lowering-related changes in metabolic pathways by metabolomics and network pharmacology. Initially, a hyperlipidemic mouse model induced by triton WR-1339 was established to evaluate the therapeutic effects of FA. Subsequently, serum metabolomics was utilized to identify differential metabolites, and metabolic pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0. Thirdly, network pharmacology was employed to identify potential targets of FA for hyperlipidemia. Finally, the compound-target-metabolite (C-T-M) network obtained core targets and validated them with molecular docking. RESULTS: Biochemical analysis and histological examination showed that FA had lipid-lowering effects on hyperlipidemic mice. It identified 31 potential biomarkers for FA against hyperlipidemia by metabolomics involving lipid and amino acid metabolism. Lipid and atherosclerosis signaling pathways were identified as the key signaling pathways of FA against hyperlipidemia by KEGG analysis. Conjoint analysis showed that FA against hyperlipidemia was associated with 18 core targets and six biomarkers. Molecular docking results showed that FA has a high binding affinity to these core targets. DISCUSSION: Through the synergy of network pharmacology and metabolomics, this study provides insights into how FA regulates endogenous metabolites, underscoring its promise as a treatment for hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is commonly occurring pathogen associated with nosocomial infections. Infections are difficult to treat because of their multidrug-resistant (MDR) nature and their tendency to form biofilms. Therefore, it is essential to find alternative medicinal approaches to treatment. In this regard, targeting an important protein for drug development can be an alternative approach. Sortase A (SrtA) is an important enzyme involved in anchoring cell surface-exposed proteins to the cell envelope. SrtA is present in Gram-positive bacteria which catalyses the attachment of several virulence factors and other proteins to the cell membrane. It is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, therefore, it's a promising drug target for the development of anti-microbial drugs targeting cell adhesion, evasion, and biofilm development. To identify SrtA potential inhibitors, we have expressed and purified E. faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtAΔN59). Structural studies using homology modelling along with molecular docking of protein with selected ligand molecules were also done. The results were confirmed by MD simulation experiments. We have also performed functional validation of these compounds on bacterial growth, anti-biofilm assays and inhibition assays of selected ligands were also done against E. faecalis individually and in synergistic combinations. Results indicated that both Eugenol and Ferulic acid bind to EfSrtAΔN59 with significant interactions and show promising results.",

      "abstract": "Breweŕs spent grain (BSG) is the main by-product of the brewing industry, and due to its rapid decomposition, it generates serious environmental problems such as malodors and greenhouse gases emissions. On the other hand, this lignocellulosic compound contains a large number of antioxidants, being ferulic acid (FA) the most abundant. FA is a powerful antioxidant molecule that has demonstrated significant protective effects on key components of the skin, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, collagen, and elastin. FA inhibits melanogenesis, promotes angiogenesis and accelerates the wound healing although its use is limited by its rapid oxidation. In this study, different hydrolysis treatments (chemical, enzymatic and hydrothermal) were performed on BSG to obtain FA. Herein FA-loaded ultradeformable liposomes (ULs) were designed to improve their stability and in vivo performance. These nanosystems allow FA permeability through human skin, as proven by an ex vivo skin permeability assay using Franz diffusion cells. The toxicity and anti-inflammatory activity of the formulation has been investigated. The free form and 100 nm FA_ULs were evaluated. Cell viability was dose-dependent and provided optimal results for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions in an in vivo Oxazolone-induced Delayed Type Hypersensitivity model using Swiss CD1 mice, demonstrated by the reduction of the inflammatory cytokines expression, ear thickness, bioluminescence and histological evaluation. These results pave the way for FA-based treatments of skin and inflammatory conditions.",

      "abstract": "Population aging is a global reality driven by increased life expectancy. This demographic phenomenon is intrinsically linked to the epidemic of cognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, posing challenges for elderly and their families. In this context, the search for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize cognitive impairments becomes urgent, as these deficits are primarily associated with oxidative damage and increased neuroinflammation. Ferulic acid (FA), a natural and potent antioxidant compound, is proposed to be nanoencapsulated to target the central nervous system effectively with lower doses and an extended duration of action. Here, we evaluated the effects of the nanoencapsulated FA on d-galactose (d-Gal)- induced memory impairments. Male Wistar adult rats were treated with ferulic acid-loaded nanocapsules (FA-Nc) or non-encapsulated ferulic acid (D-FA) for 8 weeks concurrently with d-Gal (150 mg/kg s.c.) injection. As expected, our findings showed that d-Gal injection impaired memory processes and increased anxiety behavior, whereas FA-Nc treatment ameliorated these behavioral impairments associated with the aging process induced by d-Gal. At the molecular level, nanoencapsulated ferulic acid (FA-Nc) ameliorated the decrease in ACh and glutamate induced by d-galactose (d-Gal), and also increased GABA levels in the dorsal hippocampus, indicating its therapeutic superiority. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying our current promising outcomes. Nanoscience applied to pharmacology can reduce drug dosage, thereby minimizing adverse effects while enhancing therapeutic response, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. Therefore, the strategy of brain-targeted drug delivery through nanoencapsulation can be effective in mitigating aging-related factors that may lead to cognitive deficits.",

However, there is a lack of effective prevention and treatment methods for this complication. Ferulic acid (FA) has been identified as an effective anti-radiation agent. Conventional administrations of FA limit the reaching of it on skin. We aimed to develop a novel FA hydrogel to facilitate the use of FA in radiation-induced skin injury. METHODS: We cross-linked carbomer 940, a commonly used adjuvant, with FA at concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 15%. Sweep source optical coherence tomography system, a novel skin structure evaluation method, was applied to investigate the influence of FA on radiation-induced skin injury. Calcein-AM/PI staining, CCK8 assay, hemolysis test and scratch test were performed to investigate the biocompatibility of FA hydrogel. The reducibility of DPPH and ABTS radicals by FA hydrogel was also performed. HE staining, Masson staining, laser Doppler blood flow monitor, and OCT imaging system are used to evaluate the degree of skin tissue damage. Potential differentially expressed genes were screened via transcriptome analysis. RESULTS: Good biocompatibility and in vitro antioxidant ability of the FA hydrogels were observed. 10% FA hydrogel presented a better mechanical stability than 5% and 15% FA hydrogel. All three concentrations of FA remarkably promoted the recovery of radiation-induced skin injury by reducing inflammation, oxidative conidiation, skin blood flow, and accelerating skin tissue reconstruction, collagen deposition. FA hydrogel greatly inhibiting the levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18, pro-IL-1β and IL-1β in vivo and vitro levels through restraining the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Transcriptome analysis indicated that FA might regulate wound healing via targeting immune response, inflammatory response, cell migration, angiogenesis, hypoxia response, and cell matrix adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the novel FA hydrogel is a promising therapeutic method for the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced skin injury patients.",

      "abstract": "Excessive UVB exposure increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative damage and epidermal inflammation. To enhance UVB protection effect, a strong phenolic antioxidant, ferulic acid (FA) was designed onto HA via a free radical mediated method. Our previous work has confirmed its structural characterization and in vitro antioxidant. The aim of this study was to evaluate its protective effects against UVB-induced damage in human HaCaT cells. We observed a significant reduction in cell viability to 57.43 % following UVB exposure at a dose of 80 mJ/cm2. However, pretreatment with FA-HA (250 to 2000 μg·mL-1) significantly attenuated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, FA-HA was found to suppress the intracellular generation of ROS and up-regulated the expression of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). The elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) as well as the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1/9 (MMP-1/9) induced by UVB irradiation, were also effectively reduced by FA-HA. Additionally, FA-HA treatment decreases the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), ultimately preventing apoptosis. These findings suggest that FA-HA is a promising candidate for UVB protection in skincare formulations.",

METHODS: In this study, we established Candida albicans water soluble fraction (CAWS)-induced mouse coronary artery vasculitis of KD model and the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) injury model to investigate the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects of FA on KD, and try to elucidate the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: Our in vivo results demonstrated that FA exerted anti-inflammatory effects on KD by inhibiting the infiltration of CD45-positive leukocytes and fibrosis around the coronary artery. Additionally, FA downregulated the levels of inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, alleviated splenomegaly, and exhibited anti-apoptotic effects on KD by reducing TUNEL-positive cells, downregulating BAX expression, and upregulating BCL-2 expression. In addition, Our in vitro findings showed that FA could effectively inhibit TNF-α-induced HUVEC inflammation like NF-κB inhibitor QNZ by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as attenuated TNF-α-induced HUVEC apoptosis by reducing apoptotic cell numbers and the BAX/BCL-2 ratio, which could be reversed by the AMPK inhibitor compound c (CC). The further mechanistic study demonstrated that FA could restrain vascular endothelial cell inflammation and apoptosis in KD through activating the AMPK/mTOR/NF-κB pathway. However, FA alone is hard to completely restore KD into normal condition. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, FA has potential protective effects on KD, suggesting its promising role as an adjuvant for KD therapy in the future."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatic fibrosis, one of the main reasons for death globally, is a serious complication of chronic liver disorders. However, the available therapies for liver fibrosis are limited, ineffective, and often associated with adverse events. Hence, seeking for a novel, effective therapy is warranted. Our objective was to investigate the potential efficacy of ferulic acid (FA), a phenolic phytochemical, at different doses in hindering the progress of concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatic fibrosis and explore the involved mechanisms. METHODS: Thirty-six mice were assorted into 6 groups (n = 6): Group I (control); group II received FA (20 mg/kg/day orally for 4 weeks); group III received Con A (6 mg/kg/week/i.v.) for 4 weeks; groups IV, V, and VI received Con A and were offered FA at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively. RESULTS: The data showed the palliative effect of FA against Con A-induced fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner. This was obvious from the recovery of liver markers and hepatic architecture with the regression of fibrosis in FA-treated mice. FA abolished Con A-mediated oxidative insults and promoted the antioxidant enzyme activities, which run through the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Additionally, FA suppressed Con A-induced increase in NF-kB and IL-β levels, and TNF-α immune-expression. The anti-fibrotic effect of FA was evident from the drop in TGF-β, smad3 levels, α-SMA expression, and hydroxyproline content. CONCLUSION: FA attenuated Con A-induced liver fibrosis through stimulating Nrf2 signaling, suppressing NF-kB, and inhibiting the TGF-β/smad3 signaling pathway. Thus FA can be considered as a promising therapy for combating liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease, known as diabetic nephropathy (DN), is a widespread severe diabetes complication leading to kidney failure. Due to the lack of efficacious therapies, this study endeavors to enhance DN therapeutic effectiveness of ferulic acid (FRA), a natural phenolic with poor oral bioavailability, by developing a transdermal kidney-targeted spanlastic formulation. Spanlastics (SP) nanovesicles were prepared using Span 60 and Labrasol or Brij35 as edge activators (EA). Cationic guar (CG) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were employed as coatings. The formulations were assessed for entrapment efficiency (EE), particle size (PS) and zeta potential (ZP). A 21 × 31 factorial optimization of FRA spanlastic formulations revealed the desirable nanoformula was FRA-L-H-SP comprising Labrasol and hyaluronate coating. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant activity, in-vitro release, and rat skin ex-vivo permeation assessed this formula and the uncoated one (FRA-L-SP). Biochemical indicators and histopathology for diabetes and kidney injury were evaluated in the Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN rat model. Results showed significant improvements after treatment with FRA-L-H-SP compared to FRA-L-SP and free FRA, with decreased blood glucose, creatinine, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels and increased insulin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and sirtuins (SIRT). This enhancement can be acknowledged as passive targeting of SP and active targeting properties of hyaluronic to cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) receptors, revealing the potential to improve DN pathophysiology.",

According to previous studies, ferulic acid methyl ester (FAME), as the extract with the strongest comprehensive activity in the traditional Chinese medicine Huang Hua oil dot herb, has significant anti-oxidative stress and neuroprotective functions, and can effectively alleviate CIRI, but its mechanism of action is still unclear. METHODS: Firstly, the pharmacological effects of FAME were investigated by in vitro oxidative stress and inflammatory experiments. Secondly, evaluate the therapeutic effects of FAME in the treatment of CIRI by brain histopathological staining and cerebral infarct area by replicating the in vivo MACO model. Thirdly, RNA-Seq and network pharmacology were utilized to predict the possible targets and mechanisms of FAME for CIRI at the molecular level. Finally, the expression of key target proteins, as well as the key regulatory relationships were verified by molecular docking visualization, Western Blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The results of in vitro experiments concluded that FAME could significantly reduce the content of TNF-α, IL-1β and ROS, inhibiting COX-2 and iNOS protein expression in cells(p<0.01). FAME was demonstrated to have anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects. The results of in vivo experiments showed that after the administration of FAME, the area of cerebral infarction in rats with CIRI was reduced, the content of Bcl-2 and VEGF was increased(p<0.05). Network pharmacology and RNA-Seq showed that the alleviation of CIRI by FAME may be through PI3K-AKT and HIF-1 signaling pathway. Enhanced expression of HIF-1α, VEGF, p-PI3K, p-AKT proteins in the brain tissues of rats in the FAME group was verified by molecular docking and Western Blotting. CONCLUSION: FAME possesses significant anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress activities and alleviates CIRI through the PI3K/HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway."

Its effects on the structure of the complex at multiple scales and its digestibility were examined. The results demonstrated that HHP significantly influenced the digestibility of the CS-FA complex, decreasing the content of rapidly digestible starch (RDS) while increasing slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS). Notably, the combined SDS and RS content in the HHP-treated CS-FA complex with 2.0 % FA addition (38.13 %) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the CS-FA complex without HHP treatment (29.21 %) and pure CS (21.72 %). The results indicated that HHP treatment reduced the enthalpy change (ΔH), number of short-range order structures, and relative crystallinity (RC) while increasing the average particle size of these CS-FA complexes. This treatment also increased the proportion of amorphous starch regions and the degree of agglomeration between the starch and FA. HHP treatment-induced CS-FA complexes exhibited a denser fractal structure and higher short-range order, affecting the interaction sites between the starch and digestive enzymes. These findings suggest the potential application of HHP treatment and FA in modulating the postprandial glycemic response to starchy food.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the effects of ultrasound combined with ferulic acid (FA) on the quality of the Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) adductor muscles (SAM) during refrigerated storage were investigated. The results demonstrated that the combined treatment with 350 W ultrasound and FA (UFA) significantly delayed enzyme activities and microbial growth in SAM tissues compared to FA treatment alone. After 6 days of cold storage, samples treated with UFA exhibited higher hardness (2850 g), lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS = 9.35 MDA mg/g SAM), and lower total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N = 19.75 mg/100 g SAM) values compared to control and FA-treated samples. Consequently, UFA treatment prolonged the shelf life of SAM by 3 days during storage at 4°C. Based on scanning electron microscopy and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance data, these findings are attributed to UFA treatment not only reducing the degradation of SAM tissue network structure but also minimizing water loss. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Scallop adductor muscle (SAM) is commonly considered a delicacy owing to its unique mouthfeel and delicious taste. However, owing to its high moisture content and high levels of various nutrients, SAM has a short shelf life. In this work, a combination of ultrasound with ferulic acid (UFA) has been found to have effective preservation effects on SAM during refrigerated storage. Our study findings pave the way for a potential approach to maintain scallop quality during processing and storage. Moreover, our study also provides some theoretical basis for using and promoting these technologies in aquatic products.",

Ferulic acid (FA), a principal phenolic compound found in whole grains, has demonstrated potential in ameliorating oxidative stress and preserving energy homeostasis. However, the influence of FA on mitochondrial health within the context of MetS remains unexplored. Moreover, the impact of FA on autophagy, which is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and mitochondrial integrity, is not fully understood. Here, we aimed to study the mechanisms of action of FA in regulating mitochondrial health and autophagy using palmitate-treated HepG2 hepatocytes as a MetS cell model. We found that FA improved mitochondrial health by restoring redox balance and optimizing mitochondrial dynamics, including biogenesis and the fusion/fission ratio. Additionally, FA was shown to recover autophagy and activate AMPK-related cell signaling. Our results provide new insights into the therapeutic potential of FA as a mitochondria-targeting agent for the prevention and treatment of MetS.",

The molecular insights into how neuroinflammation is initially triggered and how it affects neuronal cells are yet at the age of infancy. In this study, SH-SY5Y cells were used as a model for neurons by differentiating and were co-cultured with differentiated THP1 cells (microglia model) as well as treated with Aβ(25-35) and with antioxidant FA to study inflammatory, oxidative stress responses and their effects on co-cultured neurons. Neurons co-cultured with microglial cells showed pronounced increase in ROS levels, NOS expression, truncated N-terminal form (34 kDa) of APE1 expression and AIF's translocation in the nucleus. The pre-treatment of FA, on the other hand reversed these effects. It was further evaluated how FA/Aβ treatment altered microglial phenotype that in turn affected the neurons. Microglial cells showed M1 phenotype upon Aβ(25-35) stress, while FA induced M2 phenotype against Aβ stress, suggesting that FA alleviated Aβ induced phenotype and its associated effects in the co-cultured neurons by altering the phenotype of microglial cells and induced expression of full length (37 kDa) APE1 enzyme and inhibiting AIF's nuclear translocation, thus inhibiting apoptosis. This is the first study that revealed Aβ induced cleavage of APE1 enzyme in differentiated neurons, suggesting that APE1 may be the potential early target of Aβ that loses its function and exacerbates AD pathology. FA activated a fully functional form of APE1 against Aβ stress. The impaired function of APE1 could be the initial mechanism by which Aβ induces oxidative and inflammatory responses and dietary phytochemical FA can be a potential therapeutic strategy in managing the disease by activating APE1 that not only repairs oxidative DNA base damage but also maintains mitochondrial function and alleviates neuroinflammatory responses.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive cancers, characterized by a decrease in antioxidant levels. Evidence has demonstrated that ferulic acid (FA), a natural antioxidant particularly abundant in vegetables and fruits, could be a promising candidate for GBM treatment. Since FA shows a high instability that compromises its therapeutic application, it has been encapsulated into Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) to improve its bioavailability in the brain. It has been demonstrated that tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a multi-functional protein implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. TG2 is also involved in GBM correlated with metastasis formation and drug resistance. Therefore, the evaluation of TG2 expression levels and its cellular localization are important to assess the anti-cancer effect of FA against GBM cancer. Our results have demonstrated that treatment with free FA and FA-NLCs in the U87-MG cancer cell line differently modified TG2 localization and expression levels. In the cells treated with free FA, TG2 appeared expressed both in the cytosol and in the nucleus, while the treatment with FA-NLCs showed that the protein is exclusively localized in the cytosol, exerting its pro-apoptotic effect. Therefore, our data suggest that FA loaded in NLCs could represent a promising natural agent for supplementing the current anti-cancer drugs used for the treatment of GBM.",

Wounds are complex skin lesions to treat and their treatment is long and costly. This encourages the search for alternative treatments, especially in the area of bioactive substances of natural origin. AIMS: This work aims to make a bibliographic survey on studies of the use of ferulic acid in the treatment of wounds. RESULTS: The studies found show that ferulic acid acts through different mechanisms of action such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, collagen production, angiogenic, and reepithelialization effects. These properties act synergistically in different stages of healing, which differentiates it from conventional treatments. In addition, ferulic acid has dermal absorption, low skin metabolism, and low toxicity. CONCLUSION: Studies in this area are recent and further research is needed to expand the possibilities and therapeutic efficiency of ferulic acid in wound healing.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Periodontitis, a persistent inflammatory condition, impacts the tissues supporting teeth. Beyond mechanically eradicating the biofilm, additional host-modulating agents can aid in the treatment of periodontitis. Among these, gels are a very popular choice for use in the field of dentistry as these systems boast high biocompatibility and bioadhesiveness. These qualities make them easily administered and fabricated. They are typically placed into the periodontal site via wide-port needle syringes. Many investigations have demonstrated that hydrogels possess the ability for controlled drug release and aid in periodontal wound healing. Hence, this study aimed to develop a ferulic acid hydrogel and assess its effectiveness for managing periodontitis. Materials and methods Ferulic acid hydrogel was prepared followed by haemolysis assay and biocompatibility assay. After the in vitro analysis, a clinical trial was conducted: 20 patients were divided into Group A (comprising patients in whom scaling and root planing (SRP) was done) and Group B (comprising patients in whom SRP along with hydrogel application was done). Each patient's pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI) were recorded at baseline and at three months. Intergroup and intragroup comparisons of the parameters were made. Results Ferulic acid hydrogels exhibit a minimal ratio of red blood cell destruction, indicating their low haemolytic activity. Beyond 94 hours, ferulic acid hydrogel demonstrates minimal toxicity towards human fibroblasts, suggesting it has good biocompatibility. When clinical parameters were compared after three months of treatment with SRP alone, significant reductions were observed in all parameters. However, when hydrogel application was done along with SRP, greater reduction was seen in terms of all clinical parameters indicating the efficacy of the ferulic acid hydrogel as an adjunct.  Conclusion Ferulic acid has distinct haemolytic activity as well as good biocompatibility. Its use also led to a considerable reduction in all clinical parameters, necessitating its role as a local drug delivery agent in the treatment of periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Diabetic wounds present a significant global health challenge exacerbated by chronic hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, impeding the natural healing process. Despite various treatment strategies, diabetic foot ulceration lacks standardized therapy. Ferulic acid (FA), known for its potent antidiabetic and antioxidant properties, holds promise for diabetic wound management. However, oral administration of FA faces limitations due to rapid oxidation, stability issues, and low bioavailability. The topical application of FA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (FA-CSNPs) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome these challenges. Here, we report the development of a sustained-release formulation of FA-CSNPs within a hydrogel matrix composed of Chitosan and gelatin. The FA-CSNPs were synthesized using the ionic gelation method andoptimized through a Central Composite Design (CCD) approach. Characterization of the optimized nanoparticles revealed spherical morphology, a particle size of 56.9 ± 2.5 nm, and an impressive entrapment efficiency of 90.3 ± 2.4 %. Subsequently, an FA-CSNPs-loaded hydrogel was formulated, incorporating chitosan as a gelling agent, gelatin to enhance mechanical properties and cell permeation, and glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker. Comprehensive characterization of the hydrogel included pH, moisture loss, porosity, swelling index, rheology, water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), SEM, TEM, invitro drug release studies, antioxidant activity, antibacterial efficacy, cell cytotoxicity, cell migration studies on L929 fibroblast cell line, and stability studies. The stability study demonstrated negligible variations in particle size, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency over 60 days, ensuring the stable nature of nanoparticles and hydrogel. This innovative delivery approach embedded within a hydrogel matrix holds significant promise for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of FA-CSNPs-hydrogel in diabetic wound healing applications.",

      "abstract": "The prolonged exposure to arsenic results in intestinal barrier dysfunction, which is strongly concerned with detrimental processes such as oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. Ferulic acid (FA), as a phenolic acid, possesses the capability to mitigate arsenic-induced liver damage and cardiotoxic effects dependent on inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. FA can mitigate testicular tissue damage and alveolar epithelial dysfunction, the mechanism of which may rely on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) activation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway blocking. Based on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of FA, we speculated that FA might have the potential to inhibit arsenic-induced intestinal damage. To confirm this scientific hypothesis, mice exposed to sodium arsenite were treated with FA to observe colonic histopathology and TJ protein levels, and oxidative stress and TJ protein levels in Caco-2 cells exposed to sodium arsenite were assessed after FA intervention. In addition, molecular levels of NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in colon and Caco-2 cells were also detected. As shown in our data, FA inhibited arsenic-induced colon injury, which was reflected in the improvement of mucosal integrity, the decrease of down-regulated expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1) and the inhibition of oxidative stress. Similarly, treatment with FA attenuated the inhibitory effect of arsenic on TJ protein expression in Caco-2 cells. In addition to suppressing the activation of NF-κB pathway, FA retrieved the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in colon and intestinal epithelial cells induced by arsenic. In summary, our findings propose that FA has the potential to mitigate arsenic-induced intestinal damage by preserving the integrity of intestinal epithelial TJs and suppressing oxidative stress. These results lay the groundwork for the potential use of FA in treating colon injuries caused by arsenic.",

The approach considered in this study focuses on the design and environmental assessment of an enzymatic process for the valorization of ferulic acid present in the effluent of a corn tortilla plant. The ferulic acid can be immobilized on chitosan so that the ferulic acid grafted chitosan can be used as a bioactive film with enhanced antioxidant properties with potential applications in the biotechnology sector. Its real projection approach requires the evaluation of its environmental and economic performance, trying to identify its benefits and potential in the value chain, using the Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) as a phase for the conceptual design of the process and the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology for the environmental evaluation. It should be noted that the TEA indicators are promising, since the values of the financial indicators obtained are representative of the economic profitability, which makes the ferulic acid valorization a viable process. In terms of the environmental impact of the process, the buffer dose and the chitosan production process are identified as the main critical points. This double benefit in environmental and economic terms shows that the valorization of ferulic acid for chitosan functionalization is a promising alternative to improve the sustainability performance of corn processing.",

The role of sugar beet pulp (SBP) in T2D and the mechanism of its action remain unclear, though it is abundant in phenolics and has antioxidant activity. In this study, we isolated and purified ferulic acid from SBP, referred to as SBP-E, and studied the underlying molecular mechanisms in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism developing high glucose/high fat diet-induced diabetic models in vitro and in vivo. SBP-E showed no cytotoxicity and reduced the oxidative stress by increasing glutathione (GSH) in human liver (HepG2) and rat skeletal muscle (L6) cells. It also decreased body weight gain, food intake, fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL), glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and lipid accumulation. Additionally, SBP-E decreased the oxidative stress and improved the antioxidant enzyme levels in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2D mice. Further, SBP-E reduced plasma and liver advanced glycation end products (AGEs), malondialdehyde (MDA), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in HFD-fed mice. Importantly, SBP-E significantly elevated AMPK, glucose transporter, SIRT1 activity, and Nrf2 expression and decreased ACC activity and SREBP1 levels in diabetic models. Collectively, our study results suggest that SBP-E treatment can improve obesity-induced T2D by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism via SIRT1/AMPK signalling and the AMPK/SREBP1/ACC1 pathway.",

The current mainstay of treatment, sulfasalazine, often causes adverse effects, thereby necessitating the exploration of alternative herbal medicines with fewer side effects. Portulaca oleracea L. (P. oleracea), a traditional medicinal herb, contains feruloyl amide compounds. We synthesized new compounds by conjugating ferulic acid (FA) with (±)-octopamine. Our study focused on novel FA derivatives that demonstrate protective effects against the intestinal epithelial barrier and inflammatory responses. In lipopolysaccharide-induced cells, C1 and C1a inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators. In Caco-2 cells, these compounds maintained the TJ protein expression, thereby demonstrating their protective effects on the epithelial barrier. In a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced IBD, a treatment with these compounds ameliorated features including a body weight reduction, colon shortening, an increased disease activity index, and histopathological changes. Furthermore, C1a demonstrated greater efficacy than C1 at the same concentration. These findings suggest that the novel FA derivative (C1a) effectively alleviates clinical signs and inflammatory mediators in IBD, making these compounds potential candidates as natural medicines for the treatment of IBD."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this study, the effects of dietary ferulic acid (FA) on the growth traits, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal barrier function of broilers were investigated. METHODS: In total, 192 male Arbor Acres broilers were randomly allocated to one of three dietary groups (8 replicates of 8 birds each): control (CON) group (basal diet), FA100 group (basal diet + 100 mg/kg FA), or FA200 group (basal diet + 200 mg/kg FA). The duration of the feeding trial was 42 days. RESULTS: Higher average daily gain (ADG) and lower feed to gain (F/G) ratio during day 0 to day 21 were found in the FA100 and FA200 groups, while higher ADG and lower F/G during day 21 to day 42 were only found in FA200 group, compared to the CON group (p<0.05). Serum levels of malondialdehyde and diamine oxidase on day 21 were lower in the FA100 and FA200 groups and those on day 42 were lower in the FA200 group, while glutathione peroxidase level in the FA100 and FA200 groups on day 21 and that in the FA200 group on day 42 were increased (p<0.05). On day 21, jejunal glutathione synthetase (GSS) expression was upregulated in the FA200 group (p<0.05), while jejunal and ileal expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and Occludin as well as ileal expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) were increased in the FA100 and FA200 groups compared to the CON group (p<0.05). On day 42, mRNA expression of GSS, NRF2, SOD1, and GPX1 in the jejunum and ileum as well as Claudin2 in the jejunum and Occludin in the ileum were increased in the FA200 group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Dietary FA addition could improve the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and gut integrity of broilers. The current findings provided evidence that the adoption of FA can be a nutrition intervention measure to achieve high-efficient broiler production for poultry farmers."

      "abstract": "Avamectin (AVM), a macrolide antibiotic, is widely used in fisheries, agriculture, and animal husbandry, however, its irrational use poses a great danger to aquatic organisms. Ferulic acid (FA) is a natural chemical found in the cell walls of plants. It absorbs free radicals from the surrounding environment and acts as an antioxidant. However, the protective effect of FA against kidney injury caused by AVM has not been demonstrated. In this study, 60 carp were divided into the control group, AVM group (2.404 μg/L), FA+AVM group and FA group (400 mg/kg). Pathological examination, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and western blot were used to evaluate the preventive effect of FA on renal tissue injury after AVM exposure. Histological findings indicated that FA significantly reduced the swelling and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the kidney tissues of carp triggered by AVM. Dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescent probe assay showed that FA inhibited the accumulation of kidney ROS. Biochemical results showed that FA significantly increased glutathione (GSH) content, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and catalase (CAT) activity, and decreased intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In addition, western blot results revealed that the protein expression levels of Nrf2 and p-NF-κBp65 in the carp kidney were inhibited by AVM, but reversed by the FA. The qPCR results exhibited that FA significantly increased the mRNA levels of tgf-β1 and il-10, while significantly down-regulated the gene expression levels of tnf-α, il-6 and il-1β. These data suggest that FA can reduce oxidative stress and renal tissue inflammation induced by AVM. At the same time, FA inhibited the apoptosis of renal cells induced by AVM by decreasing the transcription level and protein expression level of Bax, and increasing the transcription level and protein expression level of Bcl2, PI3K and AKT. This study provides preliminary evidence for the theory that FA reduces the level of oxidative stress, inflammation response and kidney tissue damage caused by apoptosis in carp, providing a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of the AVM.",

However, the underlying mechanisms by which FA ameliorates acute lung injury (ALI) have not been distinctly elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The project aims to observe the therapeutic effects of FA on lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI and to elucidate its specific mechanisms in regulating epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which majors in alveolar fluid clearance during ALI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the possible pathways of FA were determined through network pharmacology analyses. The mechanisms of FA in ALI were verified by in vivo mouse model and in vitro studies, including primary alveolar epithelial type 2 cells and three-dimensional alveolar organoid models. RESULTS: FA ameliorated ALI by improving lung pathological changes, reducing pulmonary edema, and upregulating the α/γ-ENaC expression in C57BL/J male mice. Simultaneously, FA was observed to augment ENaC levels in both three-dimensional alveolar organoid and alveolar epithelial type 2 cells models. Network pharmacology techniques and experimental data from inhibition or knockdown of IkappaB kinase β (IKKβ) proved that FA reduced the phosphorylation of IKKβ/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and eliminated the lipopolysaccharide-inhibited expression of ENaC, which could be regulated by nuclear protein NF-κB p65 directly. CONCLUSIONS: FA could enhance the expression of ENaC at least in part by inhibiting the IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway, which may potentially pave the way for promising treatment of ALI.",

This study aims to examine the potential effects of Ferulic acid (FA) on rats with hypothyroidism induced by propylthiouracil through the estimation of biochemical parameters and histopathological studies. METHODS: Twenty-five female wistar rats were allocated into five groups: Control group [1% CMC, p.o.], Disease group [PTU-50 mg/kg, p.o.], [Levothyroxine (LT4) group - 20 µg/kg, p.o. + PTU-50 mg/kg, p.o.], [FA -25 mg/kg, p.o. + PTU-50 mg/kg, p.o.] and [FA 50 mg/kg, p.o. + PTU-50 mg/kg, p.o.]. On 15th day blood was collected and serum was separated for estimation of biochemical parameters, liver and kidney homogenate was utilised for the estimation of oxidative stress markers and the thyroid gland was dissected to examine histological features. RESULTS: PTU administration for 14 days showed a substantial decline in T3 and T4 and increases in TSH levels. PTU-administered rats significantly increased TC, TG and LDL levels, and decreased HDL levels. AST, ALT, urea, creatinine, and IL-6 were determined and these levels were significantly altered in PTU-induced hypothyroid group. In hypothyroid rats MDA, NO, GSH and SOD levels were significantly altered. However, treatment with FA for 14 days attenuated PTU-induced alterations. Furthermore, FA improves the histological changes of the thyroid gland. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, FA treatment showed a protective effect against hypothyroidism by stimulating the thyroid hormones through the activation of thyroid peroxidase enzyme and improving thyroid function. In addition, FA diminished the increase in lipids, liver and kidney markers, oxidative stress and inflammation.",

The reduction in DON using 365-nm light was dependent on the concentration of FA, with a good correlation (r2 = 0.979) between the rate constants of DON decrease and FA concentration, which was confirmed by a pseudo-first-order kinetics analysis of the photoreaction with different FA concentrations (50-400 mg/L) for 3 h. The viability of HepG2 cells increased by 56.7% following in vitro treatment with a mixture containing the photoproducts obtained after treatment with 20 mg/L DON and 200 mg/L FA under 365-nm irradiation for 6 h. These results suggested that the photoreaction of FA under 365-nm irradiation induces the detoxification of DON through degradation or modification of DON. The antifungal effects of the combination (FA and 365-nm light) on F. graminearum were investigated. Conidia treated with the combination did not show additive or synergistic inhibition of fungal biomass and DON production in 7-day cultivated fungal samples compared with samples after single treatment. However, successive treatment, composed of 90 min irradiation at 365 nm and then treatment with 200 mg/L FA for 90 min in the dark, suppressed fungal growth and DON yield to 70% and 25% of the untreated sample level, respectively. This photo-technology involving the two treatment methods of 365-nm irradiation and FA addition as a food-grade phenolic acid in combination or successively, can aid in developing alternative approaches to eliminate fungal contaminants in the fields of environmental water and agriculture. However, further research is required to explore the underlying mechanisms of DON decontamination and its biosynthesis in F. graminearum.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI), also known as \"chemobrain,\" is a common side effect of breast cancer therapy which causes oxidative stress and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferulic acid (FA), a natural polyphenol, belongs to BCS class II is confirmed to have nootropic, neuroprotective and antioxidant effects. Here, we have developed FA solid dispersion (SD) in order to enhance its therapeutic potential against chemobrain. An amorphous ferulic acid loaded leucin solid dispersion (FA-Leu SD) was prepared by utilizing amino acid through spray-drying technique. The solid-state characterization was carried out via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Additionally, in-vitro release studies and antioxidant assay were also performed along with in-vivo locomotor, biochemical and histopathological analysis. The physical properties showed that FA-Leu SD so formed exhibited spherical, irregular surface hollow cavity of along with broad melting endotherm as observed from FE-SEM and DSC results. The XRD spectra demonstrated absence of sharp and intense peaks in FA-Leu SD which evidenced for complete encapsulation of drug into carrier. Moreover, in-vitro drug release studies over a period of 5 h in PBS (pH 7.4) displayed a significant enhanced release in the first hr (68. 49 ± 5.39%) and in-vitro DPPH assay displayed greater antioxidant potential of FA in FA-Leu SD. Furthermore, the in-vivo behavioral findings of FA-Leu SD (equivalent to 150 mg/kg of free FA) exhibited positive results accompanied by in-vivo biochemical and molecular TNF-α showed a significant difference (p < 0.001) vis-à-vis DOX treated group upon DOX + FA-Leu SD. Additionally, histopathological analysis revealed neuroprotective effects of FA-Leu SD together with declined oxidative stress due to antioxidant potential of FA which was induced by anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). Overall, the above findings concluded that spray-dried FA-Leu SD could be useful for the treatment of chemotherapy induced cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, which arises due to low levels of acetyl and butyrylcholines, an increase in oxidative stress, inflammation, metal dyshomeostasis, Aβ and tau aggregations. The currently available drugs for AD treatment can provide only symptomatic relief without interfering with pathological hallmarks of the disease. In our ongoing efforts to develop naturally inspired novel multifunctional molecules for AD, systematic SAR studies on EJMC-4e were caried out to improve its multifunctional properties. The rigorous medicinal efforts led to the development of 12o, which displayed a 15-fold enhancement in antioxidant properties and a 2-fold increase in the activity against AChE and BChE over EJMC-4e. Molecular docking and dynamics studies revealed the binding sites and stability of the complex of 12o with AChE and BChE. The PAMPA-BBB assay clearly demonstrated that 12o can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Interestingly, 12o also expresses promising metal chelation activity, while EJMC-4e was found to be devoid of this property. Further, 12o inhibited metal-induced or self Aβ1-42 aggregation. Observing the neuroprotection ability of 12o against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in the PC-12 cell line is noteworthy. Furthermore, 12o also inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and attenuated mitochondrial-induced ROS and MMP damage caused by LPS and ATP in HMC-3 cells. In addition, 12o is able to effectively reduce mitochondrial and cellular oxidative stress in the AD Drosophila model. Finally, 12o could reverse memory impairment in the scopolamine-induced AD mice model, as evident through in vivo and ex vivo studies. These findings suggest that this compound may act as a promising candidate for further improvement in the management of AD.",

      "abstract": "Nanoparticle (NP) systems have attracted the attention of researchers in recent years due to their advantages, such as modified release features, increased therapeutic efficacy, and reduced side effects. Ferulic acid (FA) has therapeutic effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-Alzheimer's, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, antihyperlipidemic, and antidiabetic. In this study, FA-loaded PLGA-based NPs were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method and the effect of varying concentrations of Poloxamer 188 and Span 60 on NP properties was investigated. FA-loaded A-FA coded formulation was chosen as optimum. High encapsulation efficiency has been achieved due to the low affinity of FA to the water phase and, therefore, its lipophilic nature, which tends to migrate to the organic phase. It was determined that the release of FA from the A-FA was slower than pure FA and prolonged release in 24 h. Antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer's effects of A-FA coded NP formulation were investigated by biological activity studies. A-FA coded NP formulation showed strong DPPH free radical scavenging, ABTS cation decolorizing, and reducing antioxidant activity. Since it has both AChE inhibitor and antioxidant properties according to the results of its anti-Alzheimer activity, it was concluded that the formulation prepared in this study shows promise in the treatment of both oxidative stress-related diseases and Alzheimer's."

      "abstract": "Aim This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the effects of ferulic acid (FA) on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity and amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide plaque formation in an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Background AD is a progressive neurological condition marked by disrupted cholinergic signaling, accumulation of Aβ peptide, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Currently, no direct anti-Alzheimer drug that effectively prevents the cognitive decline from AD has been reported. To combat this, a multi-target drug addressing several molecular aspects would be ideal for AD. Natural compounds are preferred over synthetic drugs due to their accessibility, cost-efficiency, and lower toxicity The proven association between polyphenol consumption and the prevention of AD has led to the investigation of the effect of FA, a polyphenolic compound, on acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity and Aβ peptide formation, the key targets of AD. Materials and method The free radical scavenging ability of FA was assessed by xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. Furthermore, FA was also evaluated for its inhibitory activity against AChE enzyme and amyloid beta peptide formation to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of FA. Results The results showed that FA has the potential to be an AChE inhibitor, thus helping in blocking the activity of AChE and also reducing the incidence of amyloid beta plaque formation. Furthermore, the compound also exhibited a significant antioxidant property which was demonstrated by the xanthine oxidase enzyme inhibitory effect. Conclusion From the observed results, FA has significant antioxidant and neuroprotective effects which are compared with those of their respective standards. More research is required to determine the efficacy and safety of this compound as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases like AD because the precise mechanism and degree of its AChE inhibitory effects in the brain are still elusive. A potent, selective, and effective drug is desperately needed to treat patients with AD and those at risk of developing the disease."

      "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a respiratory failure disease associated with high mortality rates in patients. The primary pathological damage is attributed to the excessive release of pro-inflammatory mediators in pulmonary tissue. However, specific therapy for ALI has not been developed. In this study, a series of novel ferulic acid-parthenolide (FA-PTL) and ferulic acid-micheliolide (FA-MCL) hybrid derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activities in vitro. Compounds 2, 4, and 6 showed pronounced anti-inflammatory activity against LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro.

      "abstract": "Protein aggregation induces profound changes in the structure along with the conformation of the protein, and is responsible for the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative conditions such as Huntington's, Creutzfeldt-Jacob, Type II diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's, etc. Numerous multi-spectroscopic approaches and in-silico experiments were utilized to investigate BSA's biomolecular interaction and aggregation in the presence of quinoline yellow. The present research investigation evaluated the interaction of BSA with the food colorant (QY) at two different pH (7.4 and 2.0). The development of the BSA-QY complex was established with UV visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. The quenching of fluorescence upon the interaction of BSA with QY revealed the static nature of quenching mechanism. The Kb value obtained from our result is 4. 54 × 10-4 M-1. The results from the competitive site marker study infer that quinoline yellow is binding with the sub-domain IB of bovine serum albumin, specifically on site III. Three-dimensional fluorescence and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy were applied for monitoring the alterations in the microenvironment of BSA upon the addition of quinoline yellow. The results from turbidity and RLS studies showed that higher concentrations of QY (80-400 µM) triggered bovine serum albumin (BSA) aggregation at pH 2.0. At pH 7.4, QY couldn't manage to trigger bovine serum albumin aggregation, perhaps because of the repulsion between negatively charged dye (QY) and anionic bovine serum albumin. The results from far-UV CD, Congo Red, and scanning electron microscopy implicate that the QY-induced aggregates exhibit amyloid fibril-like structures. Molecular docking results revealed that hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and Pi-Sulfur interactions contribute to QY-induced aggregation of BSA. Further, the amyloid inhibitory potential of ferulic acid (FA), a phenolic acid on QY-induced aggregation of BSA, has also been assessed. The QY-induced amyloid fibrils are FA-soluble, as confirmed by turbidity, RLS, and far-UV CD studies. Far-UV CD results showed that FA retains α helix and inhibits cross β sheet formation when the BSA samples were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of FA (0-500 µM). Our findings conclude that QY dye successfully stimulates BSA aggregation, but ferulic acid inhibits QY-induced aggregation of BSA. Thus, FA can serve as a therapeutic agent and can help in the treatment of various amyloid-related conditions.",

Hence, this study investigated the effect of FEAC interventions on NDEA-CCl4-induced HCAR in male Wistar rats. HCAR was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 200 mg/kg of NDEA and 0.5 mL/kg CCl4 (as a promoter of HCAR). Following the induction of HCAR, rats were treated differently with two different doses (25 and 50 mg/kg) of FEAC. HCAR induction was confirmed by the significant elevation of serum levels of ALT, AST, and α-FP. Also elevated significantly were liver levels of Akt/PKB, NF-κB, TNF-α, MDA, GSH, and activities of GST, SOD, and CAT, while levels of liver p53 and Nrf2 were significantly lowered compared with normal rats. Treatment interventions with both 25 and 50 mg/kg of FEAC against the DEN-CCl4-induced HCAR gave comparable effects, marked by a significant reduction in the levels of serum ALT, AST and α-FP, as well as liver levels of MDA, GSH, Akt/PKB, NF-κB, TNF-α, GST, SOD, and CAT, while levels of liver p53 and Nrf2 were significantly elevated compared with normal rats. Put together and judging by the outcomes of this study, FEAC being a potent antioxidant may also be potent against chemical-induced HCAR via upregulation of p53 and Nrf2, as well as downregulation of the Akt/PKB-NF-κB pathway in rats."

Our aim is to formulate polymeric mixed micelles loaded with FA to overcome its poor solubility and investigate its potential anticancer activity via miRNA-221/TP53INP1 axis-mediated autophagy in colon cancer. A D-optimal design with three factors was used for the optimization of polymeric mixed micelles by studying the effects of each of total Pluronics mixture (mg), Pluronic P123 percentage (%w/w), and drug amount (mg) on both entrapment efficiency (EE%) and particle size. The anticancer activity of FA and Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) mixed micelles formula (O2) was assessed by MTT and flow cytometry. O2 showed an EE% of 99.89%, a particle size of 13.86 nm, and a zeta potential of - 6.02 mv. In-vitro drug release studies showed a notable increase in the release rate of FA from O2, as compared to the free FA. The (IC50) values for FA from O2 and free FA were calculated against different cell lines showing a prominent IC50 against Caco-2 (17.1 µg/ml, 191 µg/ml respectively). Flow cytometry showed that FA caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in Caco-2. RT-PCR showed that O2 significantly increased the mRNA expression level of Bax and CASP-3 (4.72 ± 0.17, 3.67 ± 0.14), respectively when compared to free FA (2.59 ± 0.13, 2.14 ± 0.15), while miRNA 221 levels were decreased by the treatment with O2 (0.58 ± 0.02) when compared to free FA treatment (0.79 ± 0.03). The gene expression of TP53INP1 was increased by the treatment with O2 compared to FA at P < 0.0001. FA-loaded TPGS mixed micelles showed promising results for enhancing the anticancer effect of FA against colorectal cancer, probably due to its enhanced solubility. Thus, FA-loaded TPGS mixed micelles could be a potential therapeutic agent for colorectal cancer by targeting miRNA-221/TP53INP1 axis-mediated autophagy.",

Ferulic acid suppressed TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1. TNF-α increased p-JNK and ERK1/2, but treatment with ferulic acid (1, 10, and 50 μM) decreased p-JNK and ERK1/2. TNF-α induced the activation of IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB p65 compared to the control, but ferulic acid inhibited the activation of IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB p65. Following treatment with TNF-α, pIRS-1ser307 increased and pIRS-1tyr612 decreased compared to the control. Conversely, as a result of treatment with 1, 10, and 50 μM ferulic acid, pIRS-1ser307 was suppressed, and pIRS-1tyr612 was increased. Therefore, ferulic acid reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion by regulating JNK, ERK, and NF-κB and improved insulin resistance by suppressing pIRS-1ser. These findings indicate that ferulic acid can improve inflammation and insulin resistance in adipocytes.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a metabolic disease and a leading cause of heart failure among people with diabetes. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a versatile technique capable of combining the molecular specificity of mass spectrometry (MS) with the spatial information of imaging. In this study, we used MSI to visualize metabolites in the rat heart with high spatial resolution and sensitivity. We optimized the air flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization (AFADESI)-MSI platform to detect a wide range of metabolites, and then used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-MSI for increasing metabolic coverage and improving localization resolution. AFADESI-MSI detected 214 and 149 metabolites in positive and negative analyses of rat heart sections, respectively, while MALDI-MSI detected 61 metabolites in negative analysis. Our study revealed the heterogenous metabolic profile of the heart in a DCM model, with over 105 region-specific changes in the levels of a wide range of metabolite classes, including carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides, and their derivatives, fatty acids, glycerol phospholipids, carnitines, and metal ions. The repeated oral administration of ferulic acid during 20 weeks significantly improved most of the metabolic disorders in the DCM model. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DCM and the potential of ferulic acid as a therapeutic agent for treating this condition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The high fibre content of whole plants of Broussonetia papyrifera limits its efficient utilization. Ferulic acid esterase (FAE), in combination with xylanase, can effectively cleave the lignin-carbohydrate complex, promoting the function of cellulase. However, little is known about the impact of these additives on silage. To effectively utilize natural woody plant resources, FAE-producing Lactiplantibacillus plantarum RO395, xylanase (XY) and cellulase (CE) were used to investigate the dynamic fermentation characteristics, fibre and nitrogen components and microbial community structure during B. papyrifera ensiling. RESULTS: Broussonetia papyrifera was either not treated (CK) or treated with FAE-producing lactic acid bacteria (LP), CE, XY, LP + CE, LP + XY or LP + CE + XY for 3, 7, 15, 30 or 60 days, respectively. In comparison with those in the CK treatment, the L. plantarum and enzyme treatments (LP + CE, LP + XY and LP + XY + CE), especially the LP + XY + CE treatment, significantly increased the lactic acid concentration and decreased the pH and the contents of acid detergent insoluble protein and NH3 -N (P < 0.05). Enzyme addition improved the degradation efficiency of lignocellulose, and a synergistic effect was observed after enzyme treatment in combination with LP; in addition, the lowest acid detergent fibre, neutral detergent fibre, hemicellulose and cellulose contents were detected after the LP + CE + XY treatment (P < 0.05). Moreover, CE, XY and LP additions significantly improved the microbial community structure, increased the relative abundance of Lactiplantibacillus and Firmicutes, and effectively inhibited undesirable bacterial (Enterobacter) growth during ensiling. CONCLUSION: FAE-producing L. plantarum and the two tested enzymes exhibited synergistic effects on improving the quality of silage, which indicates that this combination can serve as an efficient method for improved B. papyrifera silage utilization. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a staple food for a significant portion of the global population, has been recognized for its traditional medicinal properties for centuries. Rice bran, a by-product of rice milling, contains many bioactive compounds with potential pharmaceutical and therapeutic benefits. In recent years, research has highlighted the anti-inflammatory potential of rice bran, contributed by the bioactive components concentrated in their bran but, unfortunately, entrapped in the bran matrix, with limited bioavailability. Previous studies have reported that the enzymatic treatment of rice bran improves the bran's bioactive compound profile but did not investigate its impact on chronic conditions such as inflammation. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of endo-1,4-β-xylanase (ERB) and Viscozyme (VRB) treated red rice bran extracts against lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages in comparison with non-enzyme-treated bran (CRB). Further established their efficacy with known anti-inflammatory compounds-ferulic acid (FA), catechin (CAT), γ-tocopherol (GTP), and γ-oryzanol (ORZ). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were pre-treated with non-toxic concentrations (10-200 μg/mL) of FA, CAT, GTP, ORZ, CRB, ERB, and VRB, followed by inflammatory stimulation with LPS for 24 h. Further, the cell supernatant and pellets were harvested to study the anti-inflammatory effects by evaluating and measuring their efficacy in inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β) and mediators (ROS, NO, PGE2, COX2, iNOS) through biochemical, ELISA, and mRNA expression studies. RESULTS: The findings showed that both ERB and VRB effectively inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6) and mediators (ROS, NO, PGE2) by downregulating mRNA expressions of inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, COX2, iNOS) and demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy higher than CRB. On comparison, ERB demonstrated exceptional efficacy by causing a reduction of 48% in ROS, 20% in TNF-α, and 23% in PGE2 at 10 μg/mL, surpassing the anti-inflammatory capabilities of all the bioactive compounds, FA and ORZ, respectively. At the same time, VRB exhibited remarkable efficacy by reducing NO production by 52% at 200 μg/mL and IL-6 by 66% at 10 μg/mL, surpassing FA, CAT, ORZ, and GTP. Further, ERB downregulated the mRNA expression of IL-10 and iNOS, while VRB downregulated TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX2 expression. Both extracts equally downregulated IL-6 expression at 10 μg/mL, demonstrating the efficacy more remarkable/on par with established anti-inflammatory compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, enzyme-treated rice bran/extract, particularly ERB, possesses excellent anti-inflammatory properties, making them promising agents for alternatives to contemporary nutraceuticals/functional food against inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD), an autosomal recessive genetic disease, is characterized by copper metabolism disorder. WD patients may have a series of cognitive deficits in terms of neurological symptoms. Ferroptosis (FPT), a type of programmed cell death, is involved in the pathological progression of various cognitive disorders, and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) is considered to be a key factor in FPT. Ferulic acid (FA) is a traditional Chinese medicine monomer, with a remarkable effect in the clinical treatment of cognitive impairment-related disease. However, its intrinsic effect on FPT is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the protective effect of FA on cognitive impairment in animal and cell models of WD, and whether the pharmacological mechanism is related to the SIRT1-mediated FPT signaling pathway. METHODS: Copper-loaded WD rats and PC12 cells WD were used as models of cognitive dysfunction in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Morris Water Maze (MWM) was used to evaluate the spatial exploration and memory abilities of rats. HE staining was used to observe neuronal damage in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Immunofluorescence (IF) was used to detect the expression of GPX4 protein. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the ultrastructure of neurons. The levels of Fe2+, MDA, SOD, GSH, 4HNE, and ROS were detected. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect the protein and mRNA levels of SIRT1, Nrf2, SCL7A11, and GPX4. RESULTS: In the WD copper-loaded model rats, MWM, TEM, and IF results showed that FA could promote the repair of learning and memory function, improve the morphological damage to hippocampal neurons, and maintain mitochondria integrity. In the PC12 cell experiment, the MTT method showed that FA increased the viability of copper-overloaded cell models. Western blot and qRT-PCR results confirmed that FA significantly increased the expression of proteins and mRNA in SIRT1, Nrf2, SCL7A11, and GPX4. In addition, FA reversed the expression of oxidative stress-related indicators, including MDA, SOD, GSH, 4HNE, and ROS. CONCLUSION: FA alleviates hippocampal neuronal injury by activating SIRT1-mediated FPT, providing a valuable candidate for traditional Chinese medicine monomer for the clinical therapeutics of WD cognitive impairment."

      "abstract": "In this study, arabinoxylans (AX) with various molecular weights (Mw) and bound ferulic acid (FA) contents were prepared to compare their effects on the gelatinization, short-term retrogradation and digestive properties of pea starch (PeS). The results indicated that all AX samples could obviously impede the pasting process of PeS and inhibit the short-term retrogradation of PeS-based gels during refrigeration by hindering the rearrangement and double helical associations of amylose. More precisely, AXs with low Mw and the highest FA content (H-FAX) exhibited the strongest intervention ability on PeS compared with the other samples. According to the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results, it might be due to the unique role of bound FA as a noncovalent cross-linking agent, which enhanced the association between AX and starch molecules through extra hydrogen bonding interactions and entanglement behaviour. On these bases, H-FAX clearly improved the hardness, chewiness, moisture content, and sensory acceptance of PeS-base gels (pea jelly), and could also regulate its starch composition during short-term refrigeration to delay starch digestion. Overall, AXs with appropriate structural features might obviously improve the quality and storage stability of PeS-based foods.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ferulic acid (Fer) displays antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties useful against neurodegenerative diseases. To increase Fer uptake and its central nervous system residence time, a dimeric prodrug, optimizing the Fer loading on nasally administrable solid lipid microparticles (SLMs), was developed. METHODS: The prodrug was synthesized as Fer dimeric conjugate methylated on the carboxylic moiety. Prodrug antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties and ability to release Fer in physiologic environments were evaluated. Tristearin or stearic acid SLMs were obtained by hot emulsion technique. In vivo pharmacokinetics were quantified by HPLC. RESULTS: The prodrug was able to release Fer in physiologic environments (whole blood and brain homogenates) and induce in vitro antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects. Its half-life in rats was 18.0 ± 1.9 min. Stearic acid SLMs, exhibiting the highest prodrug loading and dissolution rate, were selected for nasal administration to rats (1 mg/kg dose), allowing to obtain high prodrug bioavailability and prolonged residence in the cerebrospinal fluid, showing AUC (Area Under Concentration) values (108.5 ± 3.9 μg∙mL-1∙min) up to 30 times over those of Fer free drug, after its intravenous/nasal administration (3.3 ± 0.3/5.16 ± 0.20 μg∙mL-1∙min, respectively) at the same dose. Chitosan presence further improved the prodrug brain uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal administration of prodrug-loaded SLMs can be proposed as a noninvasive approach for neurodegenerative disease therapy.",

Finasteride (FIN) is an SRD5A2 inhibitor for AGA treatment, but oral FIN causes systemic adverse effects. Topical FIN delivery is anticipated to overcome this problem. Ferulic acid (FA) is a natural phenolic acid with vascular remodeling and anti-inflammatory effects. Herein, an active pharmaceutical ingredient ionic liquid (API IL) based on choline and FA (CF-IL) is for the first time constructed to load FIN for fabricating FIN CF-IL. CF-IL aims to act as carriers and cargos and enhance hair follicle (HF) co-delivery of FA and FIN for synergistic anti-alopecia. Thermal and spectroscopic analysis combined with quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics confirm the formation of CF-IL. The CF-IL simultaneously increases the solubility of FA (∼648-fold) and FIN (∼686-fold), enhances the permeation and retention of FIN and FA through the follicular pathway, and promotes cellular uptake. FIN CFIL regulates the abnormal mRNA expressions in dihydrotestosterone-irritated hDPCs, and promotes hair regrowth in AGA mice in a combined manner with FIN and FA. These findings suggest that FA-based API IL is a promising approach for percutaneously co-delivering FA and FIN to HF, providing an enhanced targeting treatment for AGA.",

Its prevention and treatment is a major challenge. Ferulic acid (FA) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that could be attractive in this setting. Our aim was to evaluate a bioactive ingredient derived from wheat bran (WB), selected for its high concentration of FA, in a murine model of GvHD. The ingredient was obtained via a bioprocess involving hydrolysis and spray-drying. GvHD was induced via HSCT between MHC-mismatched mouse strains. FA treatment was administered orally. Survival and disease scores (weight loss, hunching, activity, fur texture, and skin integrity, each scored between 0 and 2 depending on disease severity) were recorded daily, histological evaluation was performed at the end of the experiment, and serum inflammatory cytokines were analyzed on days 9 and 28. Treatment with FA did not protect GvHD mice from death, nor did it diminish GvHD scores. However, histological analysis showed that ulcers with large areas of inflammatory cells, vessels, and keratin were less common in skin samples from FA-treated mice. Areas of intense inflammatory response were also seen in fewer small intestine samples from treated mice. In addition, a slight decrease in INF-γ and TNF-α expression was observed in the serum of treated mice on day 28. The results showed some local effect of the ingredient intervention, but that the dose used may not be sufficient to control or reduce the inflammatory response at the systemic level in mice with GvHD. Higher dosages of FA may have an impact when evaluating the immunomodulatory capabilities of the hydrolyzed WB ingredient. Thus, further experiments and the use of technological strategies that enrich the ingredients in soluble ferulic acid to improve its efficacy in this setting are warranted.",

      "abstract": "The primary objective of this study is to uncover novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive form of brain cancer, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Given the complexity and resistance associated with both conditions, the study underscores the imperative need for therapeutic alternatives that can traverse the biological intricacies inherent in both neuro-oncological and neurodegenerative disorders. To achieve this, a meticulous, target-based virtual screening was employed on an ensemble of 50 flavonoids and polyphenol derivatives primarily derived from plant sources. The screening focused predominantly on molecular targets pertinent to GBM but also evaluated the potential overlap with neural pathways involved in AD. The study utilized molecular docking and Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation techniques to analyze the interaction of these compounds with a key biological target, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type Z (PTPRZ). Out of the 50 compounds examined, 10 met our stringent criteria for binding affinity and specificity. Subsequently, the highest value of binding energy was observed for the synergistic binding of luteolin and ferulic acid with the value of -10.5 kcal/mol. Both compounds exhibited inherent neuroprotective properties and demonstrated significant potential as pathway inhibitors in GBM as well as molecular modulators in AD. Drawing upon advanced in-silico cytotoxicity predictions and sophisticated molecular modeling techniques, this study casts a spotlight on the therapeutic capabilities of polyphenols against GBM. Furthermore, our findings suggest that leveraging these compounds could catalyze a much-needed paradigm shift towards more integrative therapeutic approaches that span the breadth of both neuro-oncology and neurodegenerative diseases. The identification of cross-therapeutic potential in flavonoids and polyphenols could drastically broaden the scope of treatment modalities against both fatal diseases.",

The existing thrombolytic drugs still suffer significant shortcomings, including a limited fibrin specificity and bleeding complications. Ferulic acid can directly bind the key thrombus enzymes and target to blood clots, suggesting its thrombolytic potency that may be beneficial with thrombolytic potency for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke damage. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of ferulic acid in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke injury in rats and its potential mechanism of action. Materials and methods: We conducted a literature search in six databases, including CNKI, up to July 2023. Results: Sixteen trials were included in the meta-analysis, which demonstrated that ferulic acid significantly reduced infarct size, neurological deficit score, apoptosis index, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome C levels (all p < 0.05). In addition, ferulic acid significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated Akt, mitochondrial Bcl-xL/Bax, phosphorylated astrocyte PEA15, hippocampal calcium binding protein, and mitochondrial Bcl-2/Bax ratio (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ferulic acid protects against acute ischemic stroke injury in rats by inhibiting ischemia-induced excitotoxicity, inflammatory response, and apoptosis."

      "abstract": "Glyphosate (GP, N-phosphonomethyl glycine) is one of the most popular organophosphate herbicides widely used in agricultural practices worldwide. There have been extensive reports on the biohazard attributes and hormetic impacts of GP on plant and animal systems. However, the effects of GP on plant growth-promoting microbes and its ecological relevance remain unknown. Here, we show that GP does exert a hormetic impact on Burkholderia cepacia LS-044, a rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Tainung 71) root endophytic isolate. We used increasing doses of ferulic acid (FA, 1-25 mM) and GP (0.5-5 mM) to test the growth and antifungal volatile production in LS-044 by electrochemical, liquid chromatographic, gas chromatographic and spectrophotometric means. GP treatment at a low dose (0.5 mM) increased FA utilization and significantly (P < 0.0001) enhanced antifungal volatile activity in LS-044. Although FA (1 mM) was rapidly utilized by LS-044, no chromatographically detectable utilization of GP was observed at tested doses (0.5-5 mM). LS-044 emitted predominant amounts of tropone in addition to moderate-to-minor amounts of diverse ketones and/or their derivatives (acetone, acetophenone, 2-butanone, 1-propanone, 1-(2-furanyl-ethanone, 1-phenyl-1-propanone and 1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-propanone), d-menthol, 2-methoxy-3-(1-methylethyl)-pyrazine, dimethyl disulfide, pyridine and ammonium carbamate when grown under GP supplement. GP hormesis on LS-044 induced phenotypic variations in O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Tainan 11 as evident through seed germination assay. Genes involved in the transformation of FA, and a key gene encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) with Gly-94 and Tyr-95 residues localized at active site most likely rendering EPSPS sensitivity to GP, were detected in LS-044. This is the first report on the GP hormesis influencing morphological and metabolic aspects including volatile emission in a biocontrol bacterium that could modulate rice plant phenotype.",

METHODS: Different concentrations of FA (0、10、25、50、100、200 μmol/L) was used to treat human AML cell lines Kasumi-1, HL-60, and U937 cells respectively for 24 h. The cell survival rate was detected by cell counting kit-8 method, and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each cell line was calculated. The U937 cells were divided into control group, FA group (50 μmol/L FA), FA+pcDNA group (50 μmol/L FA+transfected with empty plasmid), FA+pcDNA-TLR4 group (50 μmol/L FA+transfected with TLR4 overexpression plasmid). Flow cytometry was used to detect U937 cell cycle and cell apoptosis; plate clone formation test was used to detect U937 cell clone formation ability; fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the TLR4, NF-κB p65 mRNA levels in U937 cells; Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of CyclinD1, CyclinE, Bcl-2 related X protein (Bax), B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Caspase-3, TLR4, and NF-κB p65 protein in U937 cells. RESULTS: With the increase of FA concentration, the survival rates of Kasumi-1, HL-60 and U937 cells gradually decreased(r=-0.919, r=-0.909, r=-0.900), the IC50 of U937 cells was 50.25±2.23 μmol/L. Compared with the control group, after drug treatment of U937 cells, the ratio of G0/G1 phase cells, apoptosis rate, expression levels of Bax and Caspase-3 proteins in FA group were significantly increased (P<0.05), the number of cell clones, the ratios of S phase and G2/M phase cells, expression levels of CyclinD1, CyclinE and Bcl-2 proteins, and TLR4, NF-κB p65 mRNA and protein were significantly decreased (P<0.05); compared with FA group and FA+pcDNA group, the ratio of G0/G1 phase cells, apoptosis rate, expression levels of Bax and Caspase-3 proteins in FA+pcDNA-TLR4 group were significantly decreased (P<0.05), the number of cell clones, the ratios of S phase and G2/M phase cells, expression levels of expression levels of CyclinD1, CyclinE and Bcl-2 proteins, and TLR4, NF-κB p65 mRNA and proteins were significantly increased (P<0.05).

      "abstract": "Improving the quality of oocytes matured in vitro is integral to enhancing the efficacy of in vitro embryo production. Oxidative stress is one of the primary causes of quality decline in oocytes matured in vitro. In this study, ferulic acid (FA), a natural antioxidant found in plant cell walls, was investigated to evaluate its impact on bovine oocyte maturation and subsequent embryonic development. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were treated with different concentrations of FA (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μM) during in vitro maturation (IVM). Compared to the control group, supplementation with 5 μM FA significantly enhanced the maturation rates of bovine oocytes and the expansion of the cumulus cells area, as well as the subsequent cleavage and blastocyst formation rates after in vitro fertilization (IVF) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Furthermore, FA supplementation was observed to effectively decrease the levels of ROS in bovine oocytes and improve their mitochondrial function. Our experiments demonstrate that FA can maintain the levels of antioxidants (GSH, SOD, CAT) in oocytes, thereby alleviating the oxidative stress induced by H2O2. RT-qPCR results revealed that, after FA treatment, the relative mRNA expression levels of genes related to oocyte maturation (GDF-9 and BMP-15), cumulus cell expansion (HAS2, PTX3, CX37, and CX43), and embryo pluripotency (OCT4, SOX2, and CDX2) were significantly increased. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that FA supplementation during bovine oocyte IVM can enhance oocyte quality and the developmental potential of subsequent embryos.",

      "abstract": "Antioxidants are promising therapeutics for treating oxidative stress-mediated liver diseases. Previously, we studied a potent natural antioxidant, ferulic acid, and developed a liposomal formulation of ferulic acid (ferulic-lipo) to improve its solubility. Ferulic-lipo significantly attenuated oxidative damage in the liver by inhibiting reactive oxygenase species (ROS). However, antioxidative liposomes must be less reactive with ROS prior to reaching the target sites to effectively neutralize existing ROS. But ferulic-lipo tends to be oxidized before reaching the liver. Besides, γ-oryzanol has been reported to decompose into ferulic acid in vivo; accordingly, we hypothesized that γ-oryzanol could be employed as a natural prodrug of ferulic acid to improve stability and antioxidative effectiveness. Therefore, in this study, we prepared a liposomal formulation of γ-oryzanol (γ-ory-lipo) and investigated its therapeutic effects in a CCl4-induced rat model of liver injury. We found that γ-ory-lipo has a higher chemical stability than does free γ-oryzanol. Although the antioxidative effect of γ-ory-lipo was lower than that of ferulic-lipo, pretreatment of the HepG2 cells with γ-ory-lipo improved the viability of CCl4-treated cells to a similar level as treatment with ferulic-lipo. γ-Oryzanol was shown to be converted into ferulic acid in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, intravenous administration of γ-ory-lipo exhibited a similar effectiveness as ferulic-lipo against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, which should be the due to the conversion of γ-oryzanol into ferulic acid. These findings demonstrated that γ-ory-lipo could be a good natural prodrug of ferulic acid for eradicating its stability problem.",

Being polyphenolic compounds, they have been explored for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Based on our previous study, we selected these two compounds to further investigate their potential in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness behavior and the ensuing neuroinflammation by specifically focusing on the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Male Swiss albino mice were divided into nine groups (n = 6) consisting of Normal Control, LPS, fluoxetine (FLX), FA40, FA160, FA640, PCA40, PCA160, and PCA640 respectively. Each group received respective FA or PCA treatment except Normal Control and LPS, which received the vehicle, carboxymethylcellulose 0.25% w/v. All groups were challenged with LPS 1.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally except the Normal Control group, which received saline. Behavioral assessments were performed between 1-2 h, and the whole brains were collected at 3 h post-LPS administration. LPS-induced sickness behavior was characterized by significantly reduced spontaneous activity and high immobility time. The expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 and IL-1β was significantly increased, along with the levels of brain IL-1β suggesting the assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Furthermore, the major cytokines involved in sickness behavior, IL-6 and TNF-α were also significantly elevated with the accompanied lipid peroxidation. The results of this study emphasize that within the employed dose ranges of both FA and PCA, both the compounds were effective at blocking the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and thereby reducing the release of IL-1β and the sickness behavior symptoms. There was a prominent effect on cytokine levels and lipid peroxidation as well.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Ferulic acid (FA), which occurs naturally as the feruloylated sugar ester in grains, fruits, and vegetables, is critical for combating oxidative stress and alleviating neurodegenerative diseases resulting from free radical-generated protein aggregates in brain cells. However, FA cannot be absorbed in conjugated form. Therefore, strategies to improve the bioavailability of FA are gaining more importance. Ferulic acid esterases (FAE) of the gut microbiota are critical enzymes that facilitate FA release from feruloylated sugar ester conjugates and influence systemic health. This review provides insight into a nutrition-based approach to preventing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by altering the diversity of FAE-producing gut microbiota. RECENT FINDINGS: The human gut is a niche for a highly dense microbial population. Nutrient components and the quality of food shape the gut microbiota. Microbiota-diet-host interaction primarily involves an array of enzymes that hydrolyse complex polysaccharides and release covalently attached moieties, thereby increasing their bio-accessibility. Moreover, genes encoding polysaccharide degrading enzymes are substrate inducible, giving selective microorganisms a competitive advantage in scavenging nutrients. Nutraceutical therapy using specific food components holds promise as a prophylactic agent and as an adjunctive treatment strategy in neurotherapeutics, as it results in upregulation of polysaccharide utilisation loci containing fae genes in the gut microbiota, thereby increasing the release of FA and other antioxidant molecules and combat neurodegenerative processes.",

      "abstract": "Dysfunctional clinical outcomes following spinal cord injury (SCI) result from glial scar formation, leading to the inhibition of new axon growth and impaired regeneration. Nevertheless, nerve regeneration after SCI is possible, provided that the state of neuron development in the injured environment is improved. Hence, biomaterial-based therapy would be a promising strategy to endow a desirable environment for tissue repair. Herein, we designed a novel multifunctional injectable hydrogel with antioxidant, neuroprotective, and neuroregenerative effects. Bucladesine-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles (BCS NPs) were first prepared and embedded in a matrix of thiol-functionalized hyaluronic acid modified with ferulic acid (HASH-FA). The target hydrogel (HSP-F/BCS) was then created through Michael-type addition between HASH-FA containing BCS NPs and four-arm polyethylene glycol-maleimide (4-Arm-PEG-Mal). The obtained hydrogel with shear thinning behavior showed viscoelastic and mechanical properties similar to the normal nerve tissue. FA conjugation significantly improved the antioxidant activity of HA, and suppressed intracellular ROS formation. In situ injection of the HSP-F/BCS hydrogel in a rat contusion model of SCI inhibited glial scar progression, reduced microglia/macrophage infiltration, promoted angiogenesis, and induced myelinated axon regeneration. As a result, a significant improvement in motor performance was observed compared to other experimental groups. Taken together, the HSP-F/BCS hydrogel developed in this study could be a promising system for SCI repair.",

In this study, the potential role of FA as a means of inducing apoptosis and inhibiting colon cancer induced by the transplantation of CT26 cells was investigated. The results show that FA adjuvant treatment caused an upregulation in the expression of genes related to autophagy while simultaneously suppressing the expression of inflammatory response elements and improving the bodyweight, glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT), and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST) in vivo. Furthermore, FA inhibited the proliferation of CT26 cells and induced apoptosis, specifically by activating the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK to enhance the essential proteins BCL-2 and BAX in the apoptosis pathway. These results suggest that FA could be a promising auxiliary therapeutic agent for the treatment of colon cancer. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of FA and its synergistic effects with other compounds.",

Nevertheless, it has higher toxicity causing acute organ damage and different complications, mainly in the lungs and kidneys. Ferulic acid (FA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid imposes multiple pharmacological impacts. No protective effect of FA on PQ poisoning-caused human embryonic lung fibroblast damage has not been reported. Despite their many beneficial effects, FA is characterized by poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and phytochemical instability. To solve the problem, β-cyclodextrin nanosponge (β-CD NSs) was utilized to increase the solubility of FA so that it was grafted into β-CD NSs to establish β-CD@FA NSs. The purpose of this work was to examine for the first time the protective effect of β-CD@FA NS on MRC-5 human lung cells damages induced by PQ poisoning. MTS assay was performed to investigate the viability of MRC-5 cells at different concentrations of FA/β-CD@FA NSs when cells were co-cultured with 0.2 μg/mL PQ. The flow cytometry study was carried out to determine apoptosis. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) levels were detected using appropriate biochemistry kits. Compared with the PQ group, the cell activity, CAT, and SOD levels were significantly increased in the FA and chiefly in β-CD@FA NSs intervention groups, whereas apoptosis and MDA levels were markedly decreased. The inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 22 (IL-22) were detected. The results demonstrate that β-CD@FA NSs can inhibit PQ-induced cell damage by enhancing antioxidant stress capacity and regulation of inflammatory responses.",

In the present study, we examined the cardioprotective effects of ferulic acid (FA) and ferulic acid nanostructured solid lipid nanoparticles (FA-SLNs) in an isoproterenol (ISO) induced MI model. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five experimental groups to compare the effects of FA and FA-SLNs. The findings revealed that ISO led to extensive cardiomyopathy, characterized by increased infarction area, edema formation, pressure load, and energy deprivation. Additionally, ISO increased the levels of inflammatory markers (COX-2, NLRP3, and NF-кB) and apoptotic mediators such as p-JNK. However, treatment with FA and FA-SLNs mitigated the severity of the ISO-induced response, and elevated the levels of antioxidant enzymes while downregulating inflammatory pathways, along with upregulation of the mitochondrial bioenergetic factor PPAR-γ. Furthermore, virtual docking analysis of FA with various protein targets supported the in vivo results, confirming drug-protein interactions. Overall, the results demonstrated that FA-SLNs offer a promising strategy for protecting the heart from further injury following MI. This is attributed to the improved drug delivery and therapeutic outcomes compared to FA alone.",

      "abstract": "Microglial cells (MGCs) serve as the resident macrophages in the brain and spinal cord, acting as the first line of immune defense against pathological changes. With various phenotypes, they can shift from a homeostatic state to a reactive state or transit from a reactive to a non-inflammatory reactive state (alternative homeostatic). A well-timed transit is crucial in limiting excessive microglial reaction and promoting the healing process. Studies indicate that increased Nurr1 expression promotes anti-neuroinflammatory responses in the brain. In this study, we investigated the possible role of ferulic acid (FA) in facilitating microglia transition due to its anti-inflammatory and Nurr1-inducing effects. MGCs were extracted from the brains of male NMRI mice at postnatal day 2 (P2) and cultured with or without FA and beta-amyloid (Aβ). Real-time qRT-PCR was conducted to measure the expressions of Nurr1, IL-1β, and IL-10 genes. Immunostaining was performed to determine the number of NURR1-positive cells, and the ramification index (RI) of MGCs was calculated using Image J software. Treating MGCs with FA (50 μg/ml) induced Nurr1 and IL-10 expressions, while reducing the level of IL-1β in the absence of Aβ-stress. Further assessments on cells under Aβ-stress showed that FA treatment restored the IL-10 and Nurr1 levels, increased the RI of cells, and the number of NURR1-positive cells. Morphological assessments and measurements of the RI revealed that FA treatment reversed amoeboid and rod-like cells to a ramified state, which is specific morphology for non-inflammatory reactive microglia. To conclude, FA can provide potential alternative homeostatic transition in Aβ-reactive microglia by recruiting the NURR1 dependent anti-inflammatory responses. This makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for suppressing Aβ-induced neuroinflammatory responses in MGCs. Furthermore, given that FA has the ability to increase NURR1 levels in homeostatic microglia, it could be utilized as a preventative medication.",

MBA121 shows good β-amyloid (Aβ) anti-aggregation properties, selective inhibition of human butyrylcholinesterase, good neuroprotection against toxic insults, such as Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, and H2O2, and promising ADMET properties that support translational developments. A passive avoidance task in mice with experimentally induced amnesia was carried out, MBA121 being able to significantly decrease scopolamine-induced learning deficits. In addition, MBA121 reduced the Aβ plaque burden in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 transgenic male mice. Our in vivo results relate its bioavailability with the therapeutic response, demonstrating that MBA121 is a promising agent to treat the cognitive decline and neurodegeneration underlying AD.",

Traditional oral or subcutaneous injections are often used to treat AGA, however, they may cause severe side-effects and therefore effective treatments for AGA are currently lacking. In this work, to treat AGA, we developed a composite paste system based on minoxidil (MXD)-loaded nanoparticles and valproic acid (VPA) with the assistance of roller-microneedles (roller-MNs). The matrix of composite paste systems is carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hyaluronic acid (HA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The roller-MNs can create microchannels in the skin to enhance drug transdermal efficiency. With the combined effects of the stimulation hair follicle (HF) regrowth by upregulating Wnt/beta-catenin of VPA and the mechanical microchannels induced by roller-MNs, the as-prepared composite paste systems successfully boost perifollicular vascularization, and activate hair follicle stem cells, thereby inducing notably faster hair regeneration at a lower administration frequency on AGA mouse model compared with minoxidil. This approach offers several benefits, including the avoidance of efficacy loss due to the liver's first-pass effect associated with oral drug, reduction in the risk of infection from subcutaneous injection, and significant decrease in the side effects of lower-dose MXD.",

Our results, as demonstrated through Franz-cell experiments, indicate that the LBNs produced with poloxamer 188 in their composition create a multilamellar system. This system effectively controls the release of the drug. Nonetheless, we found that the type of non-ionic surfactant can impact the drug release rate. Regarding FA diffusion from the MAD, this showed a lower diffusion rate compared with the TF. In terms of an in vivo application, patch tests revealed that all LBN formulations tested were safe when applied under occlusive conditions for 48 h. Additionally, human skin biopsies were used to determine whether FA-containing formulations could influence skin tissue morphology or provide protection against O3 exposure. Analyses suggest that treatment with TFs composed of poloxamer 188 and MAD formulations might protect against structural skin damage (as observed in hematoxylin/eosin staining) and the development of an oxidative environment (as indicated by 4-hyroxinonenal (4HNE) expression levels) induced by O3 exposure. In contrast, formulations without the active ingredient did not offer protection against the detrimental effects of O3 exposure.Inizio modulo."

In this study, laccase (LAC) and ferulic acid (FA) were employed to improve the rheological properties and microstructure of frozen unfermented dough. The results showed that the dough with LAC + FA had a lower softening degree than the dough with FA alone. Correspondingly, LAC + FA incorporation enhanced the viscoelastic behavior of frozen unfermented dough with better stability. Furthermore, a more uniform and homogeneous gluten network was observed in the LAC + FA-supplemented dough after 21 d of storage. The structural stability of the frozen gluten sample increased after LAC + FA treatment, possibly owing to an increase in the oxidation degree of FA. Moreover, LAC + FA treatment promoted the oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups to some extent, resulting in more extensive cross-linking. LAC + FA treatment hindered the protein conformational changes typically induced by frozen storage compared with LAC alone. Overall, LAC + FA treatment has a synergistic effect on enhancing the viscoelastic behaviors of frozen unfermented dough and inhibiting the conformational variation in frozen gluten; thus, it shows promise for improving frozen dough."

The two nutraceuticals and their nanostructures were prepared and the nanostructures were assessed by transmission electron microscope and Fourier-Transform Infra-red Spectrometry. MS was induced in rats by feeding high fructose-high fat diet (HFFD). Different groups of rats fed HFFD and treated with the different nutraceuticals, atorvastatin and atorvastatin in combination with different nutraceuticals, control fed on balanced diet and control consumed HFFD without treatments were run. Plasma glucose, lipid profile, aminotransferases activity, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, urea, creatinine, insulin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were assessed along with calculation of insulin resistance. Liver fat and histopathology were investigated. All nutraceuticals in original and nanostructures showed beneficial effects in the treatment of MS, superiority was ascribed to nutraceuticals composed of chitosan and ferulic acid in both forms. A more promising treatment of MS belonged to atorvastatin administered with the different nutraceuticals.",

When associated with metformin, the first-choice drug in Type 2 diabetes treatment, FA demonstrates synergistic hypoglycemic effects, however, it also causes certain undesirable dose-related effects. This study aimed to develop a new ferulic acid - metformin multicomponent system, and incorporate it into a solid dosage form with improved biopharmaceutical parameters. A novel metformin: ferulate (1:1) salt (MFS) was produced, which was properly characterized using differing analytical techniques, including single crystal analysis. Also during the course of the study, a new polymorph of the metformin free base was observed. The MFS was obtained using solvent evaporation methods, which achieved high yields in reproducible process, as well as a 740-fold increase in ferulic acid aqueous solubility. The MFS tablets developed met quality control requirements for this dosage form, as well as revealing excellent performance in vitro dissolution tests, presenting dissolution efficiency values of 95.4 ± 0.5%. Additionally, physicochemical instability was not observed in a study at 40 °C for 3 months for both MFS powder and its tablet form. The MFS product developed is a promising candidate for further Type 2 diabetes clinical study.",

Therefore, the present study was aimed to determine the ameliorative effects of ferulic acid on acetic acid-induced colitis in rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To induce ulcerative colitis, animals received 0.8 ml of 7% acetic acid intra-rectally. Ferulic acid in 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg doses was administered orally one hour after the ulcerative colitis induction. Animals received treatments for five consecutive days and then were euthanized on the sixth day. The colon was dissected out and macroscopic lesions were examined. Colon samples were evaluated for histopathological examination, biochemical analysis, determination of the expression of inflammatory, and apoptotic genes as well as total antioxidant capacity. RESULTS: Ferulic acid significantly inhibited inflammatory and apoptotic genes mRNA expression, also production of MDA and NO. Ferulic acid significantly increased the activity of antioxidant factors (TAC content, and SOD and CAT activity), thereby preventing inflammation and histopathological damage in the colon tissue of colitis rats. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirmed the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties of ferulic acid. About the mechanism of action of this compound, it can be concluded that the ability of ferulic acid in the amelioration of ulcerative colitis is related to the inhibition of two LPS-TLR4-NF-κB and NF-κB-INOS-NO signaling pathways.",

FA supplementation was continued for 12 weeks after STZ treatment. The results indicated no difference in glucose and lipid profile with FA supplementation. However, FA supplementation reduced lipid and protein oxidative damage in the heart, liver and pancreas and increased glutathione in the pancreas. The results indicate that while oxidative damages were positively affected by FA, it was not sufficient to improve metabolic markers of diabetes."

      "abstract": "Ferulic acid (FA) is a natural polyphenol, a derivative of cinnamic acid, widely found in Angelica, Chuanxiong and other fruits, vegetables and traditional Chinese medicine. FA contains methoxy, 4-hydroxy and carboxylic acid functional groups that bind covalently to neighbouring adjacent unsaturated Cationic C and play a key role in many diseases related to oxidative stress. Numerous studies have shown that ferulic acid protects liver cells and inhibits liver injury, liver fibrosis, hepatotoxicity and hepatocyte apoptosis caused by various factors. FA has protective effects on liver injury induced by acetaminophen, methotrexate, antituberculosis drugs, diosbulbin B and tripterygium wilfordii, mainly through the signal pathways related to TLR4/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2. FA also has protective effects on carbon tetrachloride, concanavalin A and septic liver injury. FA pretreatment can protect hepatocytes from radiation damage, protects the liver from damage caused by fluoride, cadmium and aflatoxin b1. At the same time, FA can inhibit liver fibrosis, inhibit liver steatosis and reduce lipid toxicity, improve insulin resistance in the liver and exert the effect of anti-liver cancer. In addition, signalling pathways such as Akt/FoxO1, AMPK, PPAR γ, Smad2/3 and Caspase-3 have been shown to be vital molecular targets for FA involvement in improving various liver diseases. Recent advances in the pharmacological effects of ferulic acid and its derivatives on liver diseases were reviewed. The results will provide guidance for the clinical application of ferulic acid and its derivatives in the treatment of liver diseases."

      "abstract": "Tissue plasminogen activator, aiming to restore cerebral blood flow (CBF), has been used for acute ischemic strokes in clinics; however, its narrow therapeutic time window remains a serious concern. To develop novel prophylactic drugs to alleviate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injuries, ferulic acid derivative 012 (FAD012) was synthesized and showed comparable antioxidant properties to ferulic acid (FA) and probably possesses the potent ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. A more potent cytoprotective effect of FAD012 against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells was also observed. In vivo toxicity was not observed in rats given a long-term oral administration of FAD012, indicating its good tolerability. A one-week-course oral administration of FAD012 significantly alleviated middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injuries in rats, accompanied by the restoration of CBF and endothelial nitrogen oxide synthetase (eNOS) expression. Treatment with FAD012 significantly restored the cell viability and eNOS expression damaged by H2O2, used to mimic MCAO-triggered oxidative stress, in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells. Our findings suggested that FAD012 protected the viability of vascular endothelium and maintained eNOS expression, ultimately contributing to the restoration of CBF, and may provide a rationale for the development of FAD012 into an effective prophylactic drug for patients at high risk of stroke.",

WPI addition or copigment (except for Cys) addition alone could protect anthocyanin from degradation to a certain degree, and FA exhibited the best effect among copigments. Compared with the MAE-WPI and MAE-FA binary systems, ΔE of the MAE-WPI-FA ternary system decreased by 20.9% and 21.1%, respectively, and the total anthocyanin degradation rate decreased by 38.0% and 39.3%, respectively, indicating the best stabilizing effect. Remarkably, interactions between anthocyanins and Cys, which generate four anthocyanin derivatives with 513-nm UV absorption during heat treatment, did not alter the color stability of MAE solution; however, they accelerated anthocyanin degradation. These results favor the combined use of multiple methods to stabilize anthocyanins at neutral conditions.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To examine the protection of ferulic acid (FA) against ionizing radiation (IR)-induced lens injury in rats, as well as the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: FA (50 mg/kg) was administered to rats for 4 consecutive days before they were given 10 Gy γ-radiation, as well as for 3 consecutive days afterward. Two weeks after radiation, the eye tissues were collected. Histological alterations were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was utilized to assess the activities of glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the lenses. The protein and mRNA levels of Bcl-2, caspase-3, Bax, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) were quantified using Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. With nuclear extracts, the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor (Nrf2) protein expressions in the nuclei were also measured. RESULTS: Rats exposed to IR showed lens histological alterations which could be alleviated by FA. FA treatment reversed apoptosis-related markers in IR-induced lens, as evidenced by lower levels of Bax and caspase-3 and higher level of Bcl-2. Furthermore, IR induced oxidative damage manifested by decreased GSH level, increased MDA level, and decreased SOD and GR activities. FA boosted nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and increased the expressions of HO-1 and GCLC to inhibit oxidative stress, as evidenced by an increase in GSH, a decrease in MDA, and an increase in GR and SOD activities. CONCLUSION: FA may work well in preventing and treating IR-induced cataract through promoting the Nrf2 signal pathway to attenuate oxidative damage and cell apoptosis."

      "abstract": "Cancer is a significant disease that poses a major threat to human health. The main therapeutic methods for cancer include traditional surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and new therapeutic methods such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, which have been developed rapidly in recent years. Recently, the tumor antitumor effects of the active ingredients of natural plants have attracted extensive attention. Ferulic acid (FA), (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyl cinnamic), with the molecular formula is C10H10O4, is a phenolic organic compound found in ferulic, angelica, jujube kernel, and other Chinese medicinal plants but is also, abundant in rice bran, wheat bran, and other food raw materials. FA has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-radiation, and immune-enhancing effects and also shows anticancer activity, as it can inhibit the occurrence and development of various malignant tumors, such as liver cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. FA can cause mitochondrial apoptosis by inducing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). FA can also interfere with the cell cycle of cancer cells, arrest most cancer cells in G0/G1 phase, and exert an antitumor effect by inducing autophagy; inhibiting cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis; and synergistically improving the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs and reducing adverse reactions. FA acts on a series of intracellular and extracellular targets and is involved in the regulation of tumor cell signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and tumor protein 53 (P53) pathways and other signaling pathways. In addition, FA derivatives and nanoliposomes, as platforms for drug delivery, have an important regulatory effect on tumor resistance. This paper reviews the effects and mechanisms of antitumor therapies to provide new theoretical support and insight for clinical antitumor therapy.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common but severe mood disorder with a very high prevalence across the general population. Depression is of global concern and poses a threat to human physical and mental health. Ferulic acid (FA) is a natural active ingredient that has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and free radical scavenging properties. Furthermore, studies have shown that FA can exert antidepressant effects through a variety of mechanisms. The aim of the review was to comprehensively elucidate the mechanisms in FA that alleviate depression using animal models. The in vivo (animal) studies on the mechanism of FA treatment of depression were searched in PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Baidu academic, and Wan fang databases. Thereafter, the literature conclusions were summarized accordingly. Ferulic acid was found to significantly improve the depressive-like behaviors of animal models, suggesting that FA is a potential natural product in the treatment of depression. The mechanisms are achieved by enhancing monoamine oxidase A (MOA) activity, inhibiting microglia activation and inflammatory factor release, anti-oxidative stress, promoting hippocampal nerve regeneration, increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion, regulating gut microbiome, and activating protein kinase B/collapsin response mediator protein 2 (AKT/CRMP2) signaling pathway. Ferulic acid produces significant antidepressant effects in animal depression models through various mechanisms, suggesting its potential value as a treatment of depression. However, clinical research trials involving FA are required further to provide a solid foundation for its clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Ferulic acid (FA), a prevalent dietary phytochemical, has many pharmacological effects, including anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation effects, and has been widely used in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics industries. Many studies have shown that FA can significantly downregulate the expression of reactive oxygen species and activate nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling, exerting anti-oxidative effects. The anti-inflammatory effect of FA is mainly related to the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathways. FA has demonstrated potential clinical applications in the treatment of pulmonary diseases. The transforming growth factor-β1/small mothers against decapentaplegic 3 signaling pathway can be blocked by FA, thereby alleviating pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, in the context of asthma, the T helper cell 1/2 imbalance is restored by FA. Furthermore, FA ameliorates acute lung injury by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways via toll-like receptor 4, consequently decreasing the expression of downstream inflammatory mediators. Additionally, there is a moderate neuraminidase inhibitory activity showing a tendency to reduce the interleukin-8 level in response to influenza virus infections. Although the application of FA has broad prospects, more preclinical mechanism-based research should be carried out to test these applications in clinical settings. This review not only covers the literature on the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of FA, but also discusses the therapeutic role and toxicology of FA in several pulmonary diseases.",

      "abstract": "Using a simulated gastrointestinal digestion model combined with a Caco-2 cell model, this study aims to assess the bioaccessibility and cellular uptake of dietary lutein, zeaxanthin, and ferulic acid from muffins and bread prepared from blends of hairless canary seed (HCS), wheat, and corn. Residual digestive enzymes damaged the Caco-2 monolayer and necessitated the requirements for the additional clean-up of the digesta. Several digesta cleanup treatments were examined, and the C18 column, along with AEBSF inhibitor, was selected as the most effective treatment. However, the cleanup treatment reduced lutein, zeaxanthin, and ferulic acid concentrations. The bioaccessibility of lutein from muffins was high at 92-94% (without clean-up) and 81-86% (with cleanup); however, the cellular uptake was low (7-9%). The bioaccessibility and cellular uptake (4-11%) of zeaxanthin were lower than lutein. Ferulic acid from muffins exhibited a wide range of bioaccessibility for non-cleanup (105-229%) and clean-up (53-133%) digesta samples; however, cellular uptake was very low (0.5-1.8%). Bread made from wheat/HCS had higher lutein bioaccessibility (47-80%) than the control bread (42%), with an apical cellular uptake ranging from 4.3 to 9.2%. Similar to muffins, the bioaccessibility of zeaxanthin from bread was lower than lutein, while ferulic acid had a fairly high bioaccessibility at 98-103% (without clean-up) and 81-102% (with cleanup); however, zeaxanthin cellular uptake was low (0.2%). These results suggest that muffins and bread could boost the daily consumption of lutein, zeaxanthin, and ferulic acid, allowing for a small portion to be absorbed in the small intestine."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to lower antioxidant capacity and higher amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids, ram spermatozoa are very susceptible during cooling process. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the effect of the trans-ferulic acid (t-FA) on the ram semen during liquid preservation. METHODS: Semen samples were collected from the Qezel rams, pooled, and extended with the Tris-based diluent. Pooled samples enriched with different amounts of the t-FA (0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 25 mM) and preserved at 4°C for 72 h. Spermatozoa's kinematics, membrane functionality, and viability were assessed by CASA system, hypoosmotic swelling test, and eosin-nigrosin staining, respectively. Moreover, biochemical parameters were measured at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. RESULTS: Results showed that 5 and 10 mM t-FA improved forward progressive motility (FPM) and curvilinear velocity compared to the other groups at 72 h (p < 0.05). Samples treated with 25 mM t-FA showed the lowest total motility, FPM, and viability at 24, 48, and 72 h of storage (p < 0.05). Higher total antioxidant activity levels were observed in the 10 mM t-FA-treated group compared to the negative control at 72 h (p < 0.05). Treatment with 25 mM t-FA increased malondialdehyde amounts and decreased superoxide dismutase activity compared to other groups at the final time assessment (p < 0.05). Nitrate-nitrite and lipid hydroperoxides values were not affected by treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates the positive and negative influences of different concentrations of t-FA on the ram semen upon cold storage.",

      "abstract": "Ferulic acid (FA) is a naturally occurring phenolic antioxidant that is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries due to its low toxicity. Its derivatives also find numerous industrial applications and may have even higher biological activity than ferulic acid. In this study, the effect of the addition of FA and its derivatives-including vanillic acid (VA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VG)-on the oxidative stability of cold-pressed flaxseed oil and the degradation of bioactive compounds during oxidation was investigated. The results showed that FA and its derivatives affected the oxidative stability of flaxseed oil, but their antioxidant activity depended on the concentration (25-200 mg/100 g oil) and temperature of treatment (60-110 °C). Based on Rancimat test results, flaxseed oil oxidative stability predicted at 20 °C increased linearly with ferulic acid concentration, while its derivatives effectively prolonged the induction time at lower concentrations (50-100 mg/100 g oil). The addition of phenolic antioxidants (80 mg/100 g) generally showed a protective effect against polyunsaturated fatty acids (DHFA and 4-VG), sterols (4-VG), tocols (DHFA), squalene, and carotenoids (FA). The exception was VA, which increased the degradation of most bioactive compounds. It is believed that adding properly composed mixtures of FA and its derivatives (DHFA and 4-VG) can extend the shelf life of flaxseed oil and provide nutritional benefits."
