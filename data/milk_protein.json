This review explores the epidemiology, etiology and pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of CMA. CMA's prevalence varies geographically and is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. In this article, we review how to accurately diagnose CMA to avoid unnecessary dietary restrictions, as well as provide an overview of treatment options that highlight the importance of tailored dietary management and the potential for developing tolerance in affected children.

      "abstract": "The accurate quantification of food allergens is crucial for ensuring consumer safety and compliance with regulatory requirements. A proficiency test (PT) was organised to evaluate the performance of laboratories in quantifying total egg and total milk protein in cookies. The PT involved 20 laboratories, which reported results using mainly commercial ELISA kits and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The findings indicate a satisfactory performance for milk protein determination among the majority of participant laboratories. However, the quantification of egg proteins in heated products remains a challenge, with most laboratories reporting results significantly below the reference value. Several potential factors contributing to this challenge are discussed, including the denaturation of egg proteins during heat treatment, differences in extraction strategies and the antibodies used in ELISA kits, and the lack of standardised methods and conversion factors for LC-MS/MS analysis. These findings underscore the importance of regular PT exercises to evaluate laboratory performance and ensure compliance with WHO/FAO recommendations. The results of this study aim to guide the development of improved analytical methods and strategies for ensuring the accurate quantification of food allergens."

To compare the impact of different formulas on the occurrence of other atopic manifestations (AMs), autoimmune disorders (ADs) and the time of immune tolerance acquisition in a population of children with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated cow CMPA. METHODS: In a 72-month prospective cohort study the occurrence of other AMs (i.e., eczema, urticaria, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis), ADs (i.e., celiac disease, thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, idiopathic juvenile arthritis) and the time of immune tolerance acquisition were comparatively evaluated in IgE-mediated CMPA children treated with different formulas: extensively hydrolyzed casein formula containing the probiotic L. rhamnosus G (EHCF + LGG), rice hydrolyzed formula (RHF), soy formula (SF), extensively hydrolyzed whey formula (EHWF), or amino-acid based formula (AAF). RESULTS: 313 subjects were evaluated: EHCF + LGG (n = 64), RHF(n = 62), SF(n = 63), EHWF(n = 60) and AAF (n = 64). The incidence of AMs was: 0.30(Bonferroni-corrected 95%CI 0.15 to 0.44) for EHCF + LGG cohort, 0.68 (0.52-0.83) for RHF cohort, 0.73 (0.59-0.87) for SF cohort, 0.70 (0.55-0.85) for EHWF cohort and 0.83 (0.71-0.95) for AAF cohort. The corresponding risk ratios are 2.28 (1.51-3.45) for RHF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), 2.46 (1.64-3.69) for SF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), 2.36 (1.56-3.56) for EHWF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), and 2.79 (1.88-4.13) for AAF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001). The 72-month immune tolerance acquisition rate was higher in the EHCF + LGG cohort. The incidence of celiac disease was 2/313 (0.006, binomial exact 95%CI 0.0007 to 0.023). No cases of other ADs were reported. CONCLUSION: The dietary treatment with EHCF + LGG is associated with lower incidence of AMs and higher rate of immune tolerance acquisition in children with CMPA.",

      "abstract": "The protective effects of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) in alleviating inflammation have been reported. However, limited attention has been paid to the key fraction of milk fat globule membrane protein (MFGMP). This study investigated the protective effects of camel MFGMP against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. The results revealed that administering 50 mg/kg MFGMP significantly alleviated colonic inflammation, as evidenced by a marked decrease in IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels, along with pathological damage in DSS-induced mice with UC. MFGMP supplementation partially regulated gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice with UC by increasing α-diversity and the relative abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, while decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia. Additionally, MFGMP treatment exhibited significant regulatory effects on metabolites, particularly amino acid metabolism, in the feces. Specifically, this treatment restored L-valine to normal physiological levels and increased the concentrations of L-leucine, L-lysine, and L-tyrosine to nearly twice their baseline levels, whereas the concentration of L-tryptophan increased threefold. These upregulated amino acids were negatively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and positively correlated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, as indicated by Spearman's correlation analysis. Furthermore, the significant reduction in the mRNA expression levels of WNT-1, β-catenin, and Cyclin D1 suggests that MFGMP exerts a positive effect on UC via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. These findings indicate that MFGMP exerts a protective effect against UC by modulating intestinal microbiota and amino acid metabolism in mice, with potential implications for treating intestinal inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although breast milk is ideal for newborns, in some cases, it is replaced with cow's milk, which contains proteins that increase the risk of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). AIM: To evaluate CMPA prevalence in Bahrain and compare clinical characteristics of children with immunoglobulin E (IgE)- and non-IgE-mediated CMPA. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined children with CMPA diagnosed at the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic of the Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain, between 2014 and 2022, and assessed CMPA prevalence. Clinical presentations, laboratory findings, dietary modifications, and outcomes were compared between children with IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated CMPA. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test or Pearson's χ 2 test, whereas continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Of 8332 patients, 6022 (72.3%) adhered to their appointment. Of them, 618 (10.3%) were suggested of having CMPA and 595 (96.3%) were included; CMPA prevalence was 2%. Most patients were Bahraini (93.8%) and males (55.3%). Non-IgE-mediated type accounted for 77.3% cases and IgE-mediated type, 22.7%. IgE-mediated CMPA presented more in boys (P = 0.030), and later in life (5.1 months ± 4.5 months vs 4.2 months ± 4.2 months, P = 0.016, 95%CI: 0.08-1.73), had more associated diseases (P < 0.001); and presented with more cutaneous (P = 0.024) and respiratory (P = 0.003) manifestations, severe symptoms [rash/dry skin (P = 0.031), facial swelling/angioedema (P = 0.003), failure to thrive (P = 0.013), apparent life-threatening event (P < 0.001)], and positive physical findings (P = 0.002) than non-IgE-mediated CMPA. Most patients were exclusively fed cow milk formula (50.3%). The amino acid-based formula (AAF) was most prescribed (60.5%) with no difference between the two types (P = 0.173). Although breastfeeding was recommended to 49.6%, only 8.2% were exclusively breastfed. IgE-mediated CMPA was associated with a longer follow-up duration than non-IgE-mediated CMPA (17.3 months ± 14.0 months vs 13.5 months ± 13.4 months, P = 0.005, 95%CI: 1.1-6.3). CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high CMPA prevalence with clinical differences between both types that can influence treatment. AAF was most prescribed, while breastfeeding with dietary modification is rarely applied."

      "abstract": "The intensifying global warming may increase the impact of heat stress on the dairy industry. Our previous study showed that chromium yeast (CY) alleviated the negative effects of heat stress and improved the lactation performance by increasing milk protein content and yield in mid-lactation dairy cows. This study further investigated whether the increased milk protein after CY supplementation results from the promotion of microbial crude protein (MCP) synthesis by regulating rumen microorganisms and amino acid metabolites. Twelve heat-stressed dairy cows were divided into two treatment groups: one with CY supplementation (0.36 mg Cr/kg DM) and the other without CY supplementation. Samples were collected after eight weeks of formal experiment in a hot summer with the mean temperature-humidity index of 79.0 ± 3.13. Dietary CY supplementation did not affect rumen pH, total volatile fatty acid, acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, and valerate, but increased ruminal MCP concentration (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, the alpha or beta diversity of rumen microbial bacteria were not influenced by CY supplementation. At genus level, supplementation with CY increased the relative abundances of Olsenella, Lachnospiraceae _UCG-002, and Shuttleworthia (P < 0.05) and decreased those of Enterobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Oribacterium, and Bacteroidetes_BD2-2 (P < 0.05). There were 17 up-regulated and 57 down-regulated differential metabolites in the CON and CY groups. The partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) scores clearly distinguished the two groups. Chromium yeast supplementation reduced the concentrations of D-(+)-proline, DL-glutamic acid, DL-lysine, Gly-l-pro, L-(-)-serine, L-(+)-alanine, and L-(+)-aspartic acid (P < 0.05) in the ruminal fluid, which were involved in arginine biosynthesis (P = 0.029), glutathione metabolism (P = 0.047), lysine degradation (P = 0.069), and D-amino acid metabolism (P = 0.084). Spearman correlation analysis showed that milk protein content was positively correlated with MCP and negatively correlated with amino acid concentrations in the ruminal fluid (P < 0.05). Collectively, CY supplementation promoted the utilization of amino acids by rumen microorganisms to synthesize MCP, thereby increasing milk protein content and yield in heat-stressed dairy cows."

METHODS: This study employed bibliometric methods to analyze global pediatric CMPA research and identify future directions for the first time. Visual analyses were conducted using VOS Viewer and CiteSpace software. RESULTS: A total of 2040 articles published between 2000 and 2023 showed increasing annual publications. In this field of research, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has made significant contributions, with the most influential articles published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Current research emphasizes personalized therapy, probiotics, and gut microbiota in CMPA. CONCLUSION: Future research will focus on microbiota-related personalized treatments, promising effective clinical interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Industrial processing and storage of milk products can strongly increase protein glycation level. Previously, we have reported that ingestion of highly glycated milk protein attenuates the postprandial rise in plasma lysine concentrations compared to the ingestion of an equivalent amount of milk protein with a low glycation level. Whether the attenuated increase in plasma lysine availability is attributed to compromised protein digestion and subsequent lysine absorption remains to be established. OBJECTIVES: The present study combined stable-isotope methodology with the ingestion of specifically produced, intrinsically labeled protein to assess protein digestion and amino acid absorption following ingestion of milk protein with a high versus low glycation level in vivo in humans. METHODS: Fifteen recreationally active, healthy young males participated in this double-blinded, randomized cross-over study. Subjects ingested 40 g intrinsically L-[1-13C]-lysine-labeled milk protein with either a low (3%) or high (50%) glycation level. Continuous intravenous infusion of L-[4,4,5,5-2H4]-lysine was combined with frequent blood sample collection during a 6-h postprandial period to evaluate dietary protein-derived lysine release into the circulation. RESULTS: Postprandial plasma lysine concentrations were lower following the ingestion of milk protein with a high versus low glycation level (time × treatment effect: P = 0.002; ƞ2 = 0.214), resulting in a 23 mmol/L x 360 min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13, 32) lower incremental area under the curve (0 ± 12 vs 23 ± 11 mmol/L x 360 min, respectively, P < 0.001). The postprandial release of milk protein-derived lysine into the circulation was attenuated following ingestion of the protein with the high versus low glycation level (time × treatment effect: P < 0.001; ƞ2 = 0.640) and was 31% (95% CI: 26, 36) lower over the full 6-h postprandial period (18 ± 4 vs 49 ± 10% of the ingested lysine, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A high level of milk protein glycation strongly reduces postprandial plasma lysine availability in vivo in humans. Industrial processing and storage of (milk) protein products can strongly modulate protein bioavailability and, as such, lower the nutritional value of a protein source.

      "abstract": "An iron-containing milk protein named lactoferrin (Lf) has demonstrated antiparasitic and immunomodulatory properties against a variety of human parasites. This protein has shown its capability to bind and transport iron molecules in the vicinity of the host-pathogen environment. The ability of parasites to sequester the iron molecule and to increase their pathogenicity and survival depends on the availability of iron sources. Lf protein has suggested a iron chelating effect on parasites iron and, hence, has shown its antiparasitic effect. Since the parasites have a complex life cycle and have developed drug resistance, vaccines and other treatments are a handful. Therefore, therapeutic research focusing on natural treatment regimens that target the parasite and are non-toxic to host cells is urgently needed. The antiparasitic efficacy of Lf protein has been extensively studied over the past 40 years using both in vitro and in vivo studies. This review article highlighted past important studies on Lf protein that revealed its potential antiparasitic activity against various intracellular and extracellular intestinal or blood-borne human parasites. This review article structures the role of Lf protein in its various forms, such as native, peptide, and nanoformulation, laying the groundwork for its function as an antiparasitic agent and its possible known mechanisms of action."

The present study elucidates the mechanisms by which phenylalanine affects milk protein synthesis, amino acid utilization, and related signaling pathways in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). The BMECs were treated with five concentrations (0, 0.22, 0.44, 0.88, 1.76 mM, and serum free). Rapamycin inhibitors and RNA interference (RNAi) were used to inhibit the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and the expression of relevant amino acid transporters, respectively. The results showed that 4×Phe (0.88 mM) significantly increased (p < 0.05) both the mRNA and protein expression of α-casein (CSN1S1), β-casein (CSN2), and κ-casein (CSN3), as well as L-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1) mRNA expression. Protein expression and modification assays of mTOR-related proteins showed that 4×Phe could increase (p < 0.05) the expression of α-casein and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1) and tended to increase the expression of ribosomal protein S6 protein kinase (S6K1, p = 0.054). The general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) signaling pathway factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), was downregulated by 4×Phe treatment (p < 0.05). The rapamycin inhibition test showed that Phe regulated casein synthesis via the mTOR signaling pathway. RNAi experiments showed that LAT1 mediated the entry of Phe into cells. Moreover, 4×Phe treatment tended to decrease (0.05 < p < 0.10) the consumption of valine, leucine, histidine, tyrosine, cysteine, alanine, asparagine, and serine in the medium. Collectively, phenylalanine enhanced α-casein synthesis by regulating the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and eIF2α and promoting the formation of the mTOR-centered casein translation initiation complex.",

      "abstract": "The influence of heating as a pretreatment on the structural and functional attributes of milk protein concentrate (MPC) powders derived from ultrafiltered/diafiltered (UF/DF) skim milk is under-reported. This research delves into the impact of pH and heat treatment on skim milk's properties before UF/DF and how these changes affect the resulting MPC powders. By adjusting the pH of skim milk to 6.5, 6.8, or 7.1 and applying thermal treatment at 90 °C for 15 min to one of two divided lots (with the other serving as a control), we studied the protein interactions in MPC. Post-heat treatment, the skim milk's pH was adjusted back to 6.8, followed by ultrafiltration and spray drying to produce MPC powders with protein content of 82.38 ± 2.72% on a dry matter basis. MPC dispersions from these powders at 5% protein (w/w) were also evaluated for particle size, viscosity, and heat coagulation time (HCT) to further understand how the protein interactions in skim milk influence the properties of MPC dispersions. Capillary electrophoresis was used to assess the casein and whey protein distribution in both the soluble and colloidal phases. Findings revealed that preheating skim milk at pH 7.1 increased serum phase interactions, while heating skim milk preadjusted to a pH of 6.5 promoted whey protein-casein interactions at the micellar interface. Notably, the D (4,3) of casein micelles was larger for dispersions from milk with a preheated pH of 6.5 compared to other pH levels, correlating positively with enhanced dispersion viscosity due to increased volume fraction. These results support the potential for tailoring MPC powder functionality in various food applications through the precise control of the milk's pre-treatment conditions."

This work aimed to assess the effect of cow's milk (CM) tolerance acquisition and synbiotic (inulin, oligofructose, Bifidobacterium breve M-16 V) supplementation on the fecal metabolome in infants with IgE-mediated CMA. METHODS AND RESULTS: The CMA-allergic infants received AAF or AAF-S for a year during which fecal samples were collected. The samples were subjected to metabolomics analyses covering gut microbial metabolites including SCFAs, tryptophan metabolites, and bile acids (BAs). Longitudinal data analysis suggested amino acids, BAs, and branched SCFAs alterations in infants who outgrew CMA during the intervention. Synbiotic supplementation significantly modified the fecal metabolome after 6 months of intervention, including altered purine, BA, and unsaturated fatty acid levels, and increased metabolites of infant-type Bifidobacterium species: indolelactic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid. CONCLUSION: This study offers no clear conclusion on the impact of CM-tolerance acquisition on the fecal metabolome. However, our results show that 6 months of synbiotic supplementation successfully altered fecal metabolome and suggest induced bifidobacteria activity, which subsequently declined after 12 months of intervention.",

Conventional chemotherapeutic therapies lack the specific targeting effect toward the cancerous cells resulting in extensive side effects. Our current study endeavors to prepare novel bioinspired folic acid-functionalized caffeic acid (CA)-loaded casein nanoparticles (CS NPs) for curbing breast cancer. METHODS: CA-CS NPs were prepared by simple coacervation method followed by lyophilization. Functionalized CS NPs were achieved using folic acid as the targeting moiety. Entire comparative characterization between unconjugated and conjugated NPs were implemented in terms of size, polydispersity index, surface charge, 1H-NMR, surface morphology, in-vitro drug release, sterilization, cytotoxicity, and animal studies. RESULTS: Conjugated NPs attained PS = 157.23 ± 2.64 nm, PDI = 0.309 ± 0.199, ZP = -25.53 ± 2.31 mV and IC50 = 40 ± 2.9 µg/ml. Significant reduction in the biochemical marker levels of Carcino-embryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 15-3, and malondialdehyde while increased superoxide dismutase levels were achieved in the tumor -induced rats treated by the conjugated NPs. Histopathological examinations showed great improvement in the mammary and necrotic regions.

These individuals frequently encounter inadequate dietary intake and malnutrition. With the aggravation of the severity of the person's condition, leading to increased skeletal muscle protein breakdown and reduced synthesis, which is an urgent problem to be solved in clinical nutritional treatment. Whole milk protein powder (WMPP) has promising bioactive nutrients and holds promising potential for enhancing skeletal muscle mass. The study was designed to delve into the potential effects and mechanisms of WMPP intervention for increaseing skeletal muscle mass on SIM mice. Our results clearly show that the intervention with WMPP can significantly improve the exercise capacity and skeletal muscle mass in SIM mice. It significantly increases the diameter and cross-sectional area (CSA) of skeletal muscle fibers, while effectively reducing the excessive aggregation of collagen fibers and the abnormal accumulation of adipose tissue in the skeletal muscle of SIM mice. Moreover, WMPP intervention also significantly alleviated the oxidative stress status of mitochondria, which subsequently enhanced the expression of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes. The mechanism may be associated with decreased AMPK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle tissue and simultaneously increased phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K1, and 4EBP-1 in SIM mice. In summary, the WMPP intervention significantly enhances exercise capacity and skeletal muscle mass while mitigating the oxidative stress status of mitochondria. Furthermore, it regulates skeletal muscle anabolism via the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in SIM mice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the most common food allergies in the pediatric population is allergy to cow's milk protein (CMPA). Treatment consists of avoiding cow's milk proteins in lactating mothers and/or using therapeutic formulas based on hydrolysates or vegetable formulas. In infants with CMPA at diagnosis, a different gut microbial profile has been found compared to healthy children, with a reduction in beneficial bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota profile and its metabolites, dietary patterns and anthropometric variables in a pediatric cohort with CMPA after six months on a restrictive diet compared to healthy controls. METHODS: In total, 21 patients diagnosed with CMPA and a control group of 24 healthy infants participated in this study. The fecal microbiota of all participants were investigated by metataxonomic analysis of 16S rDNA amplicons, and fecal short-chain fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Epidemiological assessment and dietary questionnaires were carried out for both groups. RESULTS: Regarding growth, no significant differences were found, but differences in dietary intake of some macro- and micronutrients were observed. Patients who were breastfed at six months had higher bifidobacteria and lipid intakes than patients fed with hydrolyzed formulas. CONCLUSIONS: Although the growth of CMPA infants fed with therapeutic formula is similar to breastfed CMPA infants, there are differences in microbiota composition and macronutrient intake that underline the importance of continued breastfeeding in CMPA cases."

      "abstract": "Commercial dairy production occurs in a complex management environment, but increasingly, the dairy manager is expected to provide detailed reporting of productivity and environmental outcomes, for which conventional research methods double-blind crossover or case:control trials are inappropriate. This paper demonstrates the development of a milk protein production monitoring tool using a temporal (baseline) control in longitudinal, census-type investigations of modulation of system performance in response to factor change. It utilises farm-derived current and historical data, and contrasts seasonal responses with those achieved on neighbouring farms in a 2 × 2 contingency table. The approach is then shown to be useful in assessing the effect of two approaches to moderating milk urea concentration. Firstly, milk urea content can be monitored as it falls due to reduced feed protein content, and this fall can be arrested when milk protein content starts to decline relative to the value expected for the herd at any lactation stage. Secondly, by providing a dietary intervention aimed at increasing the availability of metabolic energy in the last month before calving, udder development can be augmented, leading to greater protein secretion capacity, meaning greater utilisation of circulating amino acids, and thus more limited substrate for urea synthesis. Thus, the changing impact of differing nutrition practices on dairy herd nitrogen excretion to environment can be followed with daily precision. In principle this approach can provide useful insights into a wide range of practical management interventions.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-centre, prospective, observational cohort study involving 86 infants with MPIAP, aged 1-3 months, and 30 healthy controls of the same age. The FC and FZRP were marked using the ELISA method (IDK® Calprotectin or Zonulin ELISA Kit, Immunodiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany). The diagnosis of MPIAP was confirmed with an open milk challenge test. RESULTS: FFC and FZRP proved useful in evaluating MPIAP treatment with a milk-free diet, and the resolution of allergic symptoms and a significant (p = 0.0000) decrease in the concentrations of both biomarkers were observed after 4 weeks on the diet. The FC and FZRP concentrations were still higher than in the control group. A high variability of FC concentrations was found in all the study groups. An important limitation is the phenomenon of FZRP not being produced in all individuals, affecting one in five infants. CONCLUSIONS: FC and FZRP can be used to monitor the resolution of colitis in infants with MPIAP treated with a milk-free diet, indicating a slower resolution of allergic inflammation than of allergic symptoms. The diagnosis of MPIAP on the basis of FC concentrations is subject to considerable error, due to the high individual variability of this indicator. FZRP is a better parameter, but this needs further research, as these are the first determinations in infants with MPIAP.",

Rennet casein (RCN) is the desired ingredient to provide intact casein in IMC and is preferred over milk protein concentrate (MPC) and micellar casein concentrate (MCC). Transglutaminase (TGase), a crosslinking enzyme, alters the physical properties of MPC or MCC and may change IMC functionality. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of TGase-crosslinked MPC and MCC powders on the functionality of IMCs. The TGase treatment included TGase at 0.3 (L) and 3.0 (H) units/g of protein and a control (C) with no TGase addition. Each IMC formulation was balanced for constituents and was produced in a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA). The MCC or MPC powder with high TGase enzyme in IMC formulation did not form an emulsion. The IMC containing TGase-treated powders had a significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher RVA-viscosity during manufacture and transition temperature (TT), and a significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lower Schreiber melt test area. The IMC made from MPC (with or without TGase) had lower TT values and Schreiber melt test area as compared with that made from MCC. The TGase-treated MPC and MCC, when used for IMC manufacture, were comparable to IMC manufactured with RCN in texture and some measured melted characteristics. In conclusion, TGase treatment alters the melt characteristics of MCC and MPC in IMC applications."

Here, we determined the dose-dependent role of SeMet on milk protein and fat synthesis and proliferation of mammary epithelial cells (MECs), and we also uncovered the GPCR-mediating SeMet function. At 24 h postdelivery, lactating mother mice were fed a maintenance diet supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg SeMet, and the feeding process lasted for 18 days. The 10 mg/kg group had the best increase in milk production, weight gain of offspring mice, and mammary gland weight and acinar size, whereas a higher concentration of SeMet gradually decreased the weight gain of the offspring mice and showed toxic effects. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to find the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the mammary gland tissues of mother mice in the 10 mg/kg SeMet treatment group and the control group. A total of 258 DEGs were screened out, including 82 highly expressed genes including GPR37 and 176 lowly expressed genes. SeMet increased milk protein and fat synthesis in HC11 cells and cell proliferation, mTOR and S6K1 phosphorylation, and expression of GPR37 in a dose-dependent manner. GPR37 knockdown decreased milk protein and fat synthesis in HC11 cells and cell proliferation and blocked SeMet stimulation on mTOR and S6K1 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that SeMet can promote milk protein and fat synthesis and proliferation of MECs and functions through the GPR37-mTOR-S6K1 signaling pathway.",

However, the impact of hypoxia-induced activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling on milk protein and fat synthesis remains unclear. L-leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, is known to modulate milk protein and fat synthesis. Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the effect of L-leucine on milk protein and fat synthesis under hypoxic conditions and shed light on the molecular mechanism using an in vitro model. The results indicated that hypoxia treatment significantly decreased the synthesis of α-casein and β-casein, as well as inhibited factors related to milk fat synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T). Additionally, hypoxia stress suppressed the activities of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and protein kinase B (AKT). Interfering with HIF-1α significantly reversed the expression of AKT, mTOR and factors related to milk synthesis. Importantly, supplementation with L-leucine activated AKT/mTOR signaling, thereby enhancing milk protein and fat synthesis in MAC-T cells to some extent. In conclusion, these findings suggest that HIF-1 signaling plays an important role in milk synthesis and that L-leucine may stimulate the synthesis of milk protein and fat by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway under hypoxic conditions, making it a potential additive for promoting milk synthesis inhibited by hypoxia.",

      "abstract": "Challenges from infections caused by biofilms and antimicrobial resistance highlight the need for novel antimicrobials that work in conjunction with antibiotics and minimize resistance risk. In this study we investigated the composite effect of HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells), a human milk protein-lipid complex and amoxicillin on microbial ecology using an ex vivo oral biofilm model with pooled saliva samples. HAMLET was chosen due to its multi-targeted antimicrobial mechanism, together with its synergistic effect with antibiotics on single species pathogens, and low risk of resistance development. The combination of HAMLET and low concentrations of amoxicillin significantly reduced biofilm viability, while each of them alone had little or no impact. Using a whole metagenomics approach, we found that the combination promoted a remarkable shift in overall microbial composition compared to the untreated samples. A large proportion of the bacterial species in the combined treatment were Lactobacillus crispatus, a species with probiotic effects, whereas it was only detected in a minor fraction in untreated samples. Although resistome analysis indicated no major shifts in alpha-diversity, the results showed the presence of TEM beta-lactamase genes in low proportions in all treated samples but absence in untreated samples. Our study illustrates HAMLET's capability to alter the effects of amoxicillin on the oral microbiome and potentially favor the growth of selected probiotic bacteria when in combination. The findings extend previous knowledge on the combined effects of HAMLET and antibiotics against target pathogens to include potential modulatory effects on polymicrobial biofilms of human origin."

Special formulas for infants with CMPA include extensively hydrolyzed (EHFs) and amino acid-based (AAFs) formulas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth of infants fed with these special formulas. METHODS: This was a prospective chart review study that evaluated the growth criteria of infants with CMPA fed with EHFs or AAFs until one year of age. These infants were referred to the gastroenterology clinic of Bahrami Children's Hospital from April 2021 to April 2022. These infants were divided into two groups, the group fed with EHFs and AAFs. Then growth criteria were evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: Fifty-eight children were enrolled in the study, of which 51.7% were girls. Forty were consuming the EHFs formulas. The median time of both diagnosis and treatment was 60 days. The most common clinical manifestations were gastroesophageal reflux, dysentery, eczema, vomiting, and cough, respectively. The diagnosis of the disease in the AAFs group was significantly earlier than in the other group. The growth of children in both groups was completely proportional to their age and growth criteria at birth. Comparing the groups, all growth parameters were higher in the EHFs group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the growth criteria (weight, length, and head circumference) were suitable for each group and were in accordance with the WHO growth charts compared to the birth criteria. But in the group fed with EHFs, compared to AAFs, the growth rate was higher."

      "abstract": "Myocardial Infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Metabolic modulation is a promising therapeutic approach to prevent adverse remodeling after MI. However, whether material-derived cues can treat MI through metabolic regulation is mainly unexplored. Herein, a Cu2+ loaded casein microgel (CuCMG) aiming to rescue the pathological intramyocardial metabolism for MI amelioration is developed. Cu2+ is an important ion factor involved in metabolic pathways, and intracardiac copper drain is observed after MI. It is thus speculated that intramyocardial supplementation of Cu2+ can rescue myocardial metabolism. Casein, a milk-derived protein, is screened out as Cu2+ carrier through molecular-docking based on Cu2+ loading capacity and accessibility. CuCMGs notably attenuate MI-induced cardiac dysfunction and maladaptive remodeling, accompanied by increased angiogenesis. The results from unbiased transcriptome profiling and oxidative phosphorylation analyses support the hypothesis that CuCMG prominently rescued the metabolic homeostasis of myocardium after MI. These findings enhance the understanding of the design and application of metabolic-modulating biomaterials for ischemic cardiomyopathy therapy.",

A baked milk ladder is a method of dietary advancement therapy in IgE-mediated CMPA in Ireland, while in Spain, avoidance of milk awaiting natural tolerance acquisition through an oral food challenge (OFC) is employed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of dietary advancement therapy using a milk ladder compared with complete avoidance of milk for managing IgE-mediated CMPA. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 371 pediatric patients from the population who have been treated for IgE-mediated CMPA between 2011 and 2020, with the milk ladder (Ireland) or complete avoidance followed by an OFC (Spain). The main outcome was the introduction of cow's milk. RESULTS: Milk ladder patients were 3.67 times more likely to succeed in comparison with milk avoidance (p < .001). Anaphylaxis during the treatment period occurred in 34 patients in the milk avoidance groups, while three patients in the milk ladder group experienced anaphylaxis due to accidental exposure to milk (p < .001). Failure to complete treatment was associated with a higher skin prick test in the milk avoidance group and a raised specific IgE in the milk ladder group. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that compares outcomes of dietary advancement therapy to complete avoidance for CMPA management, demonstrating that cow's milk can be successfully and safely reintroduced using dietary advancement therapy using a milk ladder.",

However, to our knowledge, no clinical trials examined the effects of milk protein concentrate (MPC) on metabolic health in overweight and obese adults. This study investigated the effect of supplementation with MPC on glycaemic status, lipid profile, biomarkers of inflammation, and anthropometric measurements in women with obesity under a weight loss diet. METHODS: This is a single-blind, open-labelled, parallel-group, randomized trial. Forty-four healthy women with obesity were randomized into a control (n = 22) or MPC (n = 22) group. Participants in the MPC group were supplemented with 30 g of MPC per day for 8 weeks. Both groups were on a calorie-restricted diet plan with 800 Kcal lower intakes than their needs. Blood samples, dietary intake, and body composition were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: MPC group had a significantly lower body mass index (P = 0.009), waist circumference (P = 0.013), fat mass (P = 0.021), appetite score (P = 0.002), fasting blood sugar (P < 0.001), insulin (P = 0.027), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.025), and leptin (P = 0.014) levels and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.001) and adiponectin (P = 0.032) compared to the control group after supplementation. Lean body mass, total cholesterol, and triglyceride did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Daily intake of 30 g of MPC for 8 weeks may improve several anthropometric and metabolic markers in women with obesity under a hypocaloric diet."

      "abstract": "The effect of shear on heat-induced changes in milk protein concentrate suspensions was examined at different pH levels, revealing novel insights into micellar dissociation and protein aggregation dynamics. Milk protein concentrate suspensions, adjusted to pH of 6.1, 6.4, 6.8, or 7.5, underwent combined heat (90 °C for 5 min or 121 °C for 2.6 min) and shear (0, 100, or 1000 s-1) treatment. The fragmentation of protein aggregates induced by shear was evident in the control MPC suspensions at pH 6.8, irrespective of the temperature. At pH 7.5, shear increased the heat-induced micellar dissociation. This effect was particularly pronounced at 121 °C and 1000 s-1, resulting in reduced particle size and an elevated concentration of κ-casein (κ-CN) in the non-sedimentable phase. At pH 6.1 or 6.4, shear effects were dependent on sample pH, thereby modifying electrostatic interactions and the extent of whey protein association with the micelles. At pH 6.1, shear promoted heat-induced aggregation, evidenced by an increase in particle size and a significant decline in both whey proteins and caseins in the non-sedimentable phase. At pH 6.4, shear-induced fragmentation of aggregates was observed, prominently due to comparatively higher electrostatic repulsions and fewer protein interactions. The influence of shear on heat-induced changes was considerably impacted by initial pH."

      "abstract": "One of the most frequent triggers of food anaphylaxis in pediatric age but also among the most common, early, and complex causes of childhood food allergy is cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). The diagnostic course and management of this allergy is defined in a complex clinical picture due to several factors. First of all, the epidemiological data are not uniform, mainly as a consequence of the diagnostic methodology used in the various studies and the different age ranges covered. In addition, there is the complexity of terminology, since although CMPA traditionally refers to immune-mediated reactions to cow's milk, it is a term encompassing numerous clinical features with different symptoms and the requirement for specific treatments. Moreover, the differential diagnosis with other very frequent diseases, especially in the first year of life, such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease or colic, is still complex. This can result in misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment, with harmful health consequences and significant economic repercussions. In this context, the combination of several omics sciences together, which have already proved useful in clarifying the allergenicity of cow's milk proteins with greater precision, could improve the diagnostic tests currently in use through the identification of new, more specific, and precise biomarkers that make it possible to improve diagnostic accuracy and predict the patient's response to the various available treatments for the recovery of tolerance."

A community pharmacist possessing adequate knowledge and appropriate practices is crucial for the management of the disease. OBJECTIVES: : This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of community pharmacists toward the complications and treatment of cow milk protein allergy. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 332 randomly selected community pharmacists in the Capital of Sudan (Khartoum state). Data were collected using a validated and internally consistent (Cronbach Alpha = 0.712) self-administered questionnaire Descriptive statistics and Chi-square analysis were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25. RESULTS: The response rate was 95.8%, and about 47.8% of the population had 1-5 years of experience as community pharmacists, and 37.4% of them had a post-graduate degree. Only 30.8% of respondents had good knowledge, while 40.6% had poor knowledge, and 28.6% had scored as having fair knowledge of complications of Cow's milk protein allergy. Regarding knowledge toward treatment, 65.1% of respondents had a poor knowledge, 24.5% had fair knowledge, and only 10.4% had good knowledge. Overall, 39.62% of participants had a positive attitude, and 60.38% had a negative attitude toward this disease. Data analysis showed no significant association between the sociodemographic characteristics of respondents and their knowledge and attitude. CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists in Khartoum State had inadequate knowledge and attitude about the complications and treatment of cow milk protein allergy. As a result, we recommend the implementation of strategies to raise pharmacists' knowledge and attitude."

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the influence of heat treatment and homogenization on the gastric protein digestion and AA emptying of bovine milk. METHODS: Nine-wk-old pigs (n = 144) consumed either raw, pasteurized nonhomogenized (PNH), pasteurized homogenized (PH), or ultra-high-temperature homogenized (UHT) bovine milk for 10 d. On day 11, fasted pigs received the milk treatment (500 mL) before gastric contents were collected at 0, 20, 60, 120, 180, and 300 min postprandially. The apparent degree of gastric protein hydrolysis (based on the release of free amino groups), apparent gastric disappearance of individual proteins [based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel band intensity], and the gastric emptying of digested protein and AA were determined. RESULTS: During the first 60 min, the rate of apparent gastric protein hydrolysis was fastest in pigs fed UHT milk (0.29%/min compared with on average 0.07%/min in pigs fed raw, PNH, and PH milk). Differences in the apparent degree of gastric protein hydrolysis and emptying were reflected in the rate of digested protein entering the small intestine. The AA gastric emptying half-time was generally shorter in pigs fed PH and UHT milk than in pigs fed raw and PNH milk. For example, the gastric release of total essential AA was >2-fold faster (P < 0.01) in pigs fed PH or UHT milk than that in pigs fed raw or PNH milk (i.e., homogenized compared with nonhomogenized milk). CONCLUSIONS: Heat treatment and homogenization increased the apparent gastric degree of protein hydrolysis and the release of digested protein into the small intestine. However, the rate of AA entering the small intestine was mainly increased by homogenization.",

Skim milk was microfiltered at 50°C using 0.1-μm ceramic membranes with a diafiltration ratio of water to milk of about 2.5. Milk lactose, serum proteins, and soluble minerals were removed simultaneously to produce protein beverages containing from 3.4% to 10.5% true protein from skim milk and this process was replicated twice with different skim milks. The soluble mineral plus lactose content was very low and the aqueous phase of the beverages had a freezing point very close to water (i.e., -0.02°C). Beverage pH ranged from 7.19 to 7.41, with pH decreasing with increasing protein concentration. Overall, the beverages were whiter and blander than skim milk. When UHT processed with direct steam injection at a holding temp of 140°C for 2 to 3 s, there was some protein aggregation detected by particle size analysis (volume mean diameter of protein particles was 0.16 μm before and 22 μm after UHT). No sulfur or eggy flavor was detected, and no browning was observed, due to the UHT thermal treatment. Both apparent viscosity and sensory viscosity increased with increasing protein concentration and heat treatment.",

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two tertiary care centers in Bogotá. Demographic, medical information, and QoL scores were collected by parental interview. We carried out a cost-of-illness analysis based on self-reported out-of-pocket expenses attributed to the treatment as a whole and the family's monthly income. Exploratory analyses used the QoL scores and the percentage of out-of-pocket expenses attributable to treatment as outcomes. RESULTS: 122 families were analyzed. Median subject age was 17 months (Q1-Q3: 11-26.75 months) and female subjects made up 71% of the sample. The median QoL score was 3.21 points (Q1-Q3: 2.43-4.34) and only differed by age groups and personal history of other food allergies. The median out-of-pocket treatment related costs was 300,000 Colombian pesos (COP) (Q1-Q3: 280,000-340,000 COP). About 17% of the families had to pay over 15% of their monthly income to purchase food and dietary products. Out-of-pocket treatment related costs differed depending on whether the treatment included formulas (Mann-Whitney test p < 0.001). Out-of-pocket treatment expenses were uncorrelated with the QoL scores. CONCLUSION: Food allergy related QoL scores were not associated with out-of-pocket expenses as a whole or as a fraction of monthly income but were higher in children with additional food allergies and in older age groups, suggesting a lower QoL.",

      "abstract": "Whey protein isolate (WPI)-based nanodelivery systems have recently attracted an increasing amount of attention. Despite this, research focusing on milk protein concentrate (MPC) and micellar casein (MCC) as carriers loaded in hydrophobic compounds is lacking. This study investigated the mediated effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in 3 different milk proteins for the embedding of astaxanthin (ASTA) after ultrasound-assisted pH-shifting treatment. We then evaluated the application of milk protein carriers in cheese processing by comparing MPC, MCC, and WPI. The particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential results of the milk protein-DHA complex suggested that the addition of 0.36 μmol/mL DHA optimized the delivery of milk protein to ASTA. All 3 DHA-mediated milk proteins induced an improvement in encapsulation efficiency and antioxidant properties of ASTA. Furthermore, the DHA-mediated MPC and MCC played a stronger role in improving the bioaccessibility and thermal and storage stability of ASTA than those without DHA. Tests conducted to examine the application in cheese production indicated that MCC carrier had a positive effect on the texture of cheeses. However, the delivery effect was dependent on the milk protein variety, and MCC exhibited the best protection ability of ASTA, followed by MPC and WPI. The simulated digestion and storage stability results of cheese further confirmed that the protein encapsulation mediated by DHA was more conducive to ASTA absorption. These findings suggested that the DHA-mediated milk protein complexes studied here may be suitable hydrophilic delivery carriers for the hydrophobic nutrient ASTA, potentially playing different roles in improving its storage stability and bioaccessibility.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study, led by a scientific committee of five experts in CMPA, was divided into six phases, including a modified Delphi process. A total of 20 panelists, all of whom were pediatric specialists, participated in administering a comprehensive 38-item questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into two blocks: Diagnosis and Treatment (20 items each). RESULTS: Consensus was reached on all the proposed items, with an agreement rate of over 70% for each of them. As a result, a diagnostic and treatment algorithm was developed that emphasized the reduction of unnecessary diagnostic studies and encouraged breastfeeding whenever possible. In cases where breast milk is not available, appropriate use of hypoallergenic formulas was recommended. In addition, recommendations on treatment duration and gradual reintroduction of cow's milk protein were provided. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations endorsed by 20 Mexican pediatricians through this study are applicable to everyday clinical practice, thereby enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of children under 2 years of age with CMPA. This, in turn, will foster improved health outcomes and optimize the utilization of healthcare resources.",

      "abstract": "Milk is a common ingredient in fried foods. Allergen cross-contact can occur through the reuse of frying oil. To enable assessment of the allergy risk of reused oil, methods for quantification of milk protein in oil are needed. This study evaluated four commercial ELISA test kits in comparison with the 660 nm total protein assay for the detection of milk protein in oil after frying. Corn oil spiked with nonfat or whole milk powder were fried at 150 °C or 180 °C for 3 min and were analyzed by ELISA kits either directly or after preextraction with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (PBST). All four ELISA kits performed well in quantifying milk protein in unheated oil, achieving normalized recoveries of 72.1-115.9% compared with that determined in reference solutions (PBST spiked with nonfat or whole milk powder, 100%). Frying lowered the amount of protein detected, but the extent of reduction differed between test kits. In nonfat milk powder-spiked oil fried at 150 °C, normalized recoveries determined by Veratox Total Milk and BioKits BLG Assay (49.9% and 43.6%, respectively) were higher than that determined by the 660 nm assay (25.4%). Normalized recoveries determined by ELISA Systems Casein and Beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG) kits were substantially lower (9.7% and 2.4%, respectively). In samples fried under typical frying temperature (180 °C), very little protein (0.1-7.4%) was detected. Inclusion of PBST preextraction improved the detection of the two test kits targeting BLG but lowered the level of protein detected by Veratox and ELISA Systems Casein in fried samples. Overall, the ELISA kits evaluated could effectively quantify milk protein in unheated oil without the need to remove the oil phase prior to analysis. Heat treatment was the key factor negatively affecting protein quantitation. Such impact needs to be considered when ELISA test results are used for assessing the allergy risk of reused frying oil.",

The application of shear led to a notable reduction in non-sedimentable proteins, resulting in an increase in the average particle size and apparent viscosity of the dispersions, particularly at high concentrations of k-carrageenan and elevated temperatures. This indicates that shear forces induced prominent protein aggregation, especially at higher κ-carrageenan concentrations. This aggregation was primarily attributed to the destabilisation of micelles and presence of loosely bound caseins within the κ-carrageenan network, which exhibited increased susceptibility to aggregation as collision frequencies increased due to shear."

In this study, female BALB\\C mice in the whey protein (WP-sensitized) group were gavaged with WP and normal saline, the sham-sensitized group was given normal saline once a week for 5 weeks. One week later, the WP-sensitized mice were administered 60 mg β-lactoglobulin (BLG). The results showed that mice's body weight decreased, feces with loose and bloody, and systemic allergic reactions and ear swelling increased in the WP-sensitized group. The levels of WP-specific Ig, mMCP-1, calprotectin of feces, and inflammation-related factors in the WP-sensitized group were increased. WP-sensitized group intestine tissues were damaged severely and the expressions of ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin reduced. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing showed that there were differences in operational taxonomic units (OUT) levels of gut microbes between the two groups, o_Clostridiales, c_Clostridia, and f_Lachnospiraceae were more abundant in the WP-sensitized group. In conclusion, the WP sensitization can induce the allergic inflammation, intestinal injury and intestinal barrier dysfunction in mice, and the gut microbes were also changed, which provided a reference for the treatment of WP-sensitized mice.",

      "abstract": "A broad range of allergic disorders and intolerance are associated with cow's milk protein in the infant diet. Allergy and intolerance to cow's milk proteins are commonly recognized in the healthy term infant, and the prevalence cow's milk protein intolerance (CMPI) varies widely but 5 challenge confirmed studies free from selection bias ranged from 1.9%-4.9%. These disorders are classified by the presence of IgE, non-IgE or T-cell-mediated signaling. Additionally, the severity of these adverse food reactions can range from mild gastrointestinal symptoms to severe sepsis-like episodes, as in the case of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). Food protein-induced intolerance in the healthy young infant lies in stark contrast to enterocolitis that typically occurs in the preterm neonate. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a distinct progressive disease process, usually characterized by a high mortality rate, with a risk of death from 30% to 50%. While its exact etiology is unclear, its main triggers include formula (cow's milk protein), hypoxia, perfusion-related issues, and unregulated inflammation in the premature intestine. The distinction between NEC and cow's milk protein intolerance is difficult to discern in some cases. In the late preterm population, infants with colitis can have both NEC and cow's milk intolerance on the differential. In infants with multiple episodes of mild NEC, cow's milk protein intolerance may be the underlying diagnosis. In this review, we compare the pathophysiological characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of disorders of cow's milk protein intolerance with the entity of preterm NEC. This review highlights similarities in both entities and may inspire future cross-disciplinary research."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Spain, IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) affects approximately 0.69% of infants. Molecular diagnosis may be useful for monitoring natural spontaneous tolerance development in CMPA. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse a cohort of paediatric patients with IgE-mediated CMPA who were avoiding milk products awaiting natural tolerance and determine the relationship between disease persistence and major cow's milk allergens. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 200 patients diagnosed with IgE-mediated CMPA between 2011 and 2020 was conducted. Patients strictly avoided milk products until an oral food challenge was performed. The main outcome was the introduction of liquid milk following a negative oral food challenge and its correlation with IgE and SPT measurements of milk components at diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included the rate of allergic reactions and anaphylaxis during the treatment period and its correlation with IgE and SPT measurements. RESULTS: Of the 200 charts analysed, 122 patients had a negative oral food challenge to milk (61.0%) (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.1-67.5) following a period of strict avoidance of milk. Higher levels of component-specific IgE, especially casein, were associated with failure in the oral food challenge (p = 0.02). Allergic reactions were experienced by 106 children (53%), of which 34 (17%; 95% CI: 12.4-22.8) had anaphylactic reactions. The risk of anaphylaxis was not predicted by raised IgE levels. CONCLUSIONS: While a large proportion of children acquired natural tolerance to cow's milk following a period of strict avoidance, IgE-mediated CMPA persisted in many children. Casein IgE levels at diagnosis were raised in those who failed to achieve natural tolerance. Allergic reactions to milk, including anaphylaxis, occurred commonly, but this was not predicted by raised IgE levels or SPT measurements."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most frequent food allergy in early childhood. For those infants requiring breastmilk substitutes, formulas with extensively hydrolyzed proteins (EHF), should be the treatment of choice. As there are limited data showing the progression of initial symptoms in infants newly diagnosed with CMPA who are treated with EHF with added synbiotics, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the resolution of symptoms in said infants after 4 weeks of treatment. As a secondary objective this study aimed to assess the impact of the treatment on the family's quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: observational, longitudinal, prospective, and multicentric real-world evidence study. The intervention phase (EHF with synbiotics) lasted 28 days and was completed by 65 patients. Treating physicians registered child´s anthropometry, Infant Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (IGSQ-13) and CoMiSS (Cow´s Milk Allergy Symptoms Score) both at baseline and after 28 days of treatment. During treatment, caregivers reported child´s regurgitation and stools, PO-SCORAD (Patient Oriented Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) and FAQL-PB (Family Quality of Life-Parental Burden). Data were collected using Google Forms and analyzed through the STATA program. RESULTS: 95.4% of the patients showed an improvement or disappearance of the overall initial symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms improved or disappeared in 92% of patients (p < 0.05) while dermatological symptoms improved or disappeared in 87.5% of patients (p < 0.05). The median CoMiSS at baseline was 9, with 21 patients exceeding the cut-off point of 12. After 4 weeks of treatment, the median dropped to 3, and no patient exceeded the 12-cut-off point (p = 0.000). At baseline, patients had a PO-SCORAD of 11.5 (interquartile range 1-23) that went to 1.0 (interquartile range 1-6) at day 28 (p = 0.000). The treatment diminished stool frequency (p < 0.05), improved stool consistency (p = 0.004) and decreased the frequency of regurgitation in infants with CMPA (p = 0.01). The percentage of patients who no longer had any episode of regurgitation increased from 11% to 31% on day 28 (p = 0.003). At baseline, 13% of patients cried more than 3 h per day, while at day 28 that percentage dropped to 3% (p = 0.03). An improvement in the infants' sleep pattern was also appreciated with the treatment. At study onset, 56% of the families reported feeling very overwhelmed, a percentage that dropped to 17% after 28 days of treatment (p < 0.05). The small percentage of families who did not feel overwhelmed at study onset (17%), grew to 43% on day 28 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an EHF with synbiotics for the management of infants diagnosed with or suspected to have CMPA suggested a good safety profile, an adequate infant growth, and improvement of overall, gastrointestinal, and dermatological symptoms. It also suggested a lower daily frequency of regurgitations and stools, and an improvement in stool consistency, sleeping pattern, and quality of life of the infant and his family."

      "abstract": "Cow's milk allergy refers to an immunological reaction to milk protein. It is one of the commonest food protein allergies with an estimated prevalence of 0.5% to 3% at 1 y of life. The disease may be IgE or non-IgE mediated or mixed with a wide range of symptoms often involving multiple organ systems. Gastrointestinal manifestations are common in non-IgE disease and may consist of enteropathy, proctocolitis, colic, reflux-like symptoms, constipation, enterocolitis syndrome and eosinophilic esophagitis. The gold standard for diagnosis remains a double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenge. Specific IgE and skin prick tests may predict severe and persistent disease, and aid in deciding on reintroduction or oral immunotherapy; however, they do not contribute to a definitive diagnosis as they indicate only sensitization. In practice, an elimination diet followed by open challenge under medical supervision is often used for diagnosis except when symptoms are severe such as anaphylaxis. Management consists of the elimination of the allergen with resolution of symptoms between 1-4 wk later depending on the type of allergy. Extensively hydrolyzed and Amino acid formulas are used to substitute milk in infants. Soy-based formulas are often utilized in resource-limited settings. Tolerance to the protein develops over time and periodic reintroduction should be attempted every six months after the initial one year of elimination diet. Oral immunotherapy is a newer treatment technique for IgE-mediated disease. There is no firm evidence on prevention apart from recommending breast feeding in early life along with initiating complementary feeding between 4-6 mo age.",

A meta-regression of 64 sets of observations from 29 previously published glucose and propionate infusion studies in dairy cattle, treating study and experiment (study) as random effects, was performed to establish the general effects of glucose equivalent (GlcE) infusion rate on milk true protein (MTP) yield and content, if any, and to identify independent, fixed-effect variables that accounted for the changes in MTP yield and content that were observed. Candidate explanatory variables included rate and site of infusion, diet composition and intake, body weight and lactation stage of the cows, and the change in nutrient intake between GlcE and control treatments. Across all studies, according to a model containing only the random effects of study and experiment, GlcE infusion at an average of 954 g/d increased MTP yield by 26 g/d, on average, whereas mean MTP content was not affected. Backward stepwise elimination of potential explanatory variables from a full mixed model produced a final, reduced model for MTP yield that retained a positive, second-order quadratic effect of infusion rate of GlcE and a positive, linear effect of the change in crude protein intake (CPI) between GlcE treatment and control. This change in CPI due to GlcE infusion ranged from -0.546 to 0.173 kg/d in the dataset. The model fit indicated that when CPI was allowed to drop during GlcE infusion, the effect of GlcE on MTP yield was smaller than when CPI was maintained or increased, in a manifestation of the classic protein:energy interaction. The final reduced model for MTP content contained the same explanatory variables as for MTP yield, plus a negative effect of intravenous compared with gastrointestinal infusion. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed that both MTP yield, and content were positively related to GlcE infusion rate and to the change in CPI between glucose treatment and control.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is a common condition in infants, but little is known about healthcare providers' clinical experience treating infants with CMPA. To address this gap, we analyzed prospectively collected data from healthcare providers (HCPs) who treated infants under six months old with suspected CMPA using hypoallergenic formulas. The study focused on a commercial extensively hydrolyzed formula containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC53103) (eHF-LGG) or a commercial amino acid formula (AAF). METHODS: In this secondary analysis of prospectively collected survey data, 52 HCPs treated 329 infants under six months old with suspected CMPA using hypoallergenic formulas. A series of two de-identified surveys per patient were collected by HCPs to assess short-term symptom relief in the patients and HCP's satisfaction with the management strategies. The initial survey was completed at the initiation of treatment of CMPA, and the second survey was completed at a follow-up visit. RESULTS: The majority of HCPs (87%) in the study were general pediatricians, and most saw 2 to 10 CMPA patients weekly. Results showed that clinicians reported satisfaction with treatment in 95% of patients in the EHF cohort and 97% of patients in the AAF cohort and achieved expected clinical results in 93% and 97% of patients using eHF and AAF, respectively. Furthermore, few patients were switched from the hypoallergenic formula once initiated. CONCLUSION: The study provides new insights into HCP perspectives on treating infants with CMPA and supports using hypoallergenic formulas to manage this condition. However, additional prospective controlled studies are needed to confirm these initial findings."

Milk protein concentrate was produced using a spiral wound polymeric membrane, and MCC was produced using a 0.1-µm ceramic membrane by filtration at 50°C. Two DKP concentrations were used (0% and 0.15% wt/wt) within each of the 3 heat treatments. All beverages had no other additives and ran through heat treatment without coagulation. Ultracentrifugation (2-h run at 4°C) supernatants of the beverages were collected at 1, 5, 8, 12, and 15-d storage at 4°C. Phosphorus, Ca, and K concentrations in the beverages and supernatants were measured using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. Protein composition of supernatants was measured using Kjeldahl and sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. Micellar casein concentrate and MPC beverages with 0.15% DKP had higher concentrations of supernatant protein, Ca, and P than beverages without DKP. Protein, Ca, and P concentrations were higher in MCC supernatant than in MPC supernatant when DKP was added, and these concentrations increased over storage time, especially when lower heat treatments (HTST or no heat treatment) had been applied. Dipotassium phosphate addition caused the dissociation of αS-, β-, and κ-casein, and casein proteolysis products out of the casein micelles, and DKP addition explained over 70% of the increase in supernatant protein, P, and Ca concentrations. Dipotassium phosphate could be removed from 7.5% of protein beverages made with fresh liquid MCC and MPC (containing a residual lactose concentration of 0.6% to 0.7% and the proportional amount of soluble milk minerals), as these beverages maintain heat-processing stability without DKP addition.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of astaxanthin (ASTA) encapsulation and the functional properties of milk protein and ASTA nanocomposites by an ultrasound-assisted pH-shifting treatment of different milk proteins, including milk protein concentrate (MPC), micellar casein (MCC), and whey protein isolate (WPI). The ultrasound-assisted pH-shifting treatment of milk protein helped to improve the encapsulation rate of ASTA. Therein, MCC showed great improvement of encapsulating ASTA after co-treatment with the raised encapsulated rate of 5.11%, followed by WPI and MPC. Furthermore, the nanocomposites of ASTA with milk protein exhibit improved bioavailability, antioxidant capacity, and storage stability. By comparison, MCC-encapsulated ASTA has the best storage stability, followed by MPC, and WPI-encapsulated ASTA has the least stability over a 28-d storage period. The results of intrinsic fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity showed that milk protein underwent fluorescence quenching after binding to ASTA, which was due to the hydrophobic sites of the protein being occupied by ASTA. In general, the nanocomposites of milk protein and ASTA fabricated by using an ultrasound-assisted pH-shifting treatment have the potential to be better nano-delivery systems for ASTA in functional foods, especially MCC, which showed excellent performance in encapsulation after treatment technique.",

To analyze the perspectives of Spanish pediatricians on this topic, a survey was conducted. The survey aimed to determine the current opinions and attitudes of 222 primary care and hospital pediatricians toward CMPA prevention and nutritional management. Participating pediatricians completed the questionnaire, providing insights into their daily clinical practices, including access to testing, attitudes with respect to various aspects of CMPA diagnosis, prevention, oral food challenges, and treatment. The findings revealed that pediatricians generally agree on the use of extensively hydrolyzed formulas (eHFs) to prevent CMPA in high-risk atopic children, despite limited evidence supporting the widespread use of this practice. However, consensus was lacking regarding the utility of formulas with prebiotics and probiotics for expediting tolerance development. In most cases, pediatricians preferred eHFs for the nutritional management of CMPA, followed by hydrolyzed rice formulas (HRFs), with amino-acid-based formulas (AAFs) being the third option. Certain issues remained controversial among pediatricians, such as prevention methods, symptom assessment, and the role of probiotics. These variations in management approaches reflect the influence of clinician experience and area of expertise, underscoring the need for standardized guidelines in this field.",

We conducted a randomized, multicenter intervention study involving 194 non-breastfed infants with CMPA until 12 months of age (clinical trial registration: NCT03085134). One exploratory objective was to assess the effects of a whey-based extensively hydrolyzed formula (EHF) supplemented with 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) on the fecal microbiome and metabolome in this population. Thus, fecal samples were collected at baseline, 1 and 3 months from enrollment, as well as at 12 months of age. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) supplementation led to the enrichment of bifidobacteria in the gut microbiome and delayed the shift of the microbiome composition toward an adult-like pattern. We identified specific HMO-mediated changes in fecal amino acid degradation and bile acid conjugation, particularly in infants commencing the HMO-supplemented formula before the age of three months. Thus, HMO supplementation partially corrected the dysbiosis commonly observed in infants with CMPA. Further investigation is necessary to determine the clinical significance of these findings in terms of a reduced incidence of respiratory infections and other potential health benefits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Amino acids (AAs) not only constitute milk protein but also stimulate milk synthesis through the activation of mTORC1 signaling, but which amino acids that have the greatest impact on milk fat and protein synthesis is still very limited. In this study, we aimed to identify the most critical AAs involved in the regulation of milk synthesis and clarify how these AAs regulate milk synthesis through the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling pathway. METHODS: In this study, a mouse mammary epithelial cell line (HC11) and porcine mammary epithelial cells (PMECs) were selected as study subjects. After treatment with different AAs, the amount of milk protein and milk fat synthesis were detected. Activation of mTORC1 and GPCRs signaling induced by AAs was also investigated. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that essential amino acids (EAAs) are crucial to promote lactation by increasing the expression of genes and proteins related to milk synthesis, such as ACACA, FABP4, DGAT1, SREBP1, α-casein, β-casein, and WAP in HC11 cells and PMECs. In addition to activating mTORC1, EAAs uniquely regulate the expression of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) among all amino-acid-responsive GPCRs, which indicates a potential link between CaSR and the mTORC1 pathway in mammary gland epithelial cells. Compared with other EAAs, leucine and arginine had the greatest capacity to trigger GPCRs (p-ERK) and mTORC1 (p-S6K1) signaling in HC11 cells. In addition, CaSR and its downstream G proteins Gi, Gq, and Gβγ are involved in the regulation of leucine- and arginine-induced milk synthesis and mTORC1 activation. Taken together, our data suggest that leucine and arginine can efficiently trigger milk synthesis through the CaSR/Gi/mTORC1 and CaSR/Gq/mTORC1 pathways. CONCLUSION: We found that the G-protein-coupled receptor CaSR is an important amino acid sensor in mammary epithelial cells. Leucine and arginine promote milk synthesis partially through the CaSR/Gi/mTORC1 and CaSR/Gq/mTORC1 signaling systems in mammary gland epithelial cells. Although this mechanism needs further verification, it is foreseeable that this mechanism may provide new insights into the regulation of milk synthesis.",

For this reason, we aimed to evaluate the clinical features, differential diagnosis, and treatment methods of neonates with CMPA. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The charts of twenty-six breastfed full-term and preterm newborns presenting with CMPA between October 2018 and February 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and methods used in diagnosis and treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: CMPA was diagnosed in preterm infants 50% (n=13) at the same rate as in full-term infants 50% (n=13) between 32 to 38 weeks corrected age (median 36 weeks). Among patients with CMPA, 69.2% (n=18) had blood in the stool at the onset. Cow's Milk-related Symptom Score score was found to be significantly higher prior to diagnosis vs. after treatment with the cow milk protein-free mom's milk diet [12(11-13) vs. 4(3-5), p<0.001]. Seventy-two hours after the commencement of the mothers' elimination diet, macroscopic blood in stool disappeared in all patients except one patient. Oral food challenge (OFC) for the diagnosis of CMPA was carried out on all (n=26) neonates. Eosinophilia was seen in 46.2% of patients (n=12). The methemoglobin concentration was 1.1 to 1.5% (median 1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: CMPA should be kept in mind for well-appearing preterm and full-term infants suspected of necrotizing enterocolitis and gastroenteritis, respectively, presenting with bloody stool and eosinophilia. The use of OFC can be implemented since neonates were very well monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit. Treatment is possible by continuing breastfeeding.",

This study aims to assess the impact of different feeding patterns on the incidence of cow's milk protein allergy, atopic dermatitis, and growth among infants with a family history of allergy. A total of 551 high-risk infants were randomly recruited from 3 European countries in three feeding regimens: exclusive breastfeeding, partially hydrolyzed formula, or standard formula with intact protein either exclusively or supplementary to breastfeeding. During the first 6 months of intervention, amongst infants with a family history of atopic dermatitis, 6.5% of partially hydrolyzed formula-fed infants and 22.7% of exclusively breastfed infants (p = 0.007) presented with atopic dermatitis respectively. Growth as assessed by weight increase did not differ between the aforementioned groups. Although cow's milk protein allergy was not related to the different milk feeding regimens in the whole cohort, when adjusting for high breast milk intake, the respective incident was significantly lower in the infants consuming partially hydrolyzed formula (p < 0.001). This data indicates that a specific partially hydrolyzed formula could serve as a more appropriate complement to breast milk compared to a standard intact protein formula in high-risk infants, to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis.",

This study investigated the effects of the manufacturing process on the structure and in vitro digestion properties of skim goat milk, particularly emphasizing fat separation. RESULTS: Changes in the surface charge and hydrophobicity of milk proteins caused by fat separation resulted in oxidation and aggregation in the subsequent homogenization, heat and spray-drying processing, which affected its digestibility. Compared with separation by dish separator (DS), skim milk after tubular centrifugal separation (CS) showed a higher initial and final digestibility. The CS samples also had a lower surface hydrophobicity level and higher free sulfhydryl content, ζ-potential, and average particle size (P < 0.05). Goat milk protein after CS was more readily oxidized and aggregated during the subsequent homogenization and heat treatment, as evidenced by the higher carbonyl content and particle size. Centrifugal separation also converted more β-sheets to α-helices, thus promoting the aggregation of oxidized skim milk protein. CONCLUSION: The skim milk after CS and DS demonstrated different structural and digestive properties. Skim goat milk products after CS were more susceptible to oxidant-induced protein structural changes, resulting in higher protein digestibility. These findings provide insights into the mechanism involved in the control of gastric digestion of skim milk during manufacturing process. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Furthermore, the relative effects of different milk components, milk protein (MP), and whey permeate (WP) are unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of MP and WP in lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS), and of LNS itself, on linear growth and body composition among stunted children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, 2 × 2 factorial trial among 12 to 59 months old stunted children in Uganda. Children were randomized to 4 formulations of LNS with MP or soy protein isolate and WP or maltodextrin (100 g/day for 12 weeks) or no supplementation. Investigators and outcome assessors were blinded; however, participants were only blinded to the ingredients in LNS. Data were analyzed based on intention-to-treat (ITT) using linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, season, and site. Primary outcomes were change in height and knee-heel length, and secondary outcomes included body composition by bioimpedance analysis (ISRCTN13093195). Between February and September 2020, we enrolled 750 children with a median age of 30 (interquartile range 23 to 41) months, with mean (± standard deviation) height-for-age z-score (HAZ) -3.02 ± 0.74 and 12.7% (95) were breastfed. The 750 children were randomized to LNS (n = 600) with or without MP (n = 299 versus n = 301) and WP (n = 301 versus n = 299), or no supplementation (n = 150); 736 (98.1%), evenly distributed between groups, completed 12-week follow-up. Eleven serious adverse events occurred in 10 (1.3%) children, mainly hospitalization with malaria and anemia, all deemed unrelated to the intervention. Unsupplemented children had 0.06 (95% confidence interval, CI [0.02, 0.10]; p = 0.015) decline in HAZ, accompanied by 0.29 (95% CI [0.20, 0.39]; p < 0.001) kg/m2 increase in fat mass index (FMI), but 0.06 (95% CI [-0.002; 0.12]; p = 0.057) kg/m2 decline in fat-free mass index (FFMI). There were no interactions between MP and WP. The main effects of MP were 0.03 (95% CI [-0.10, 0.16]; p = 0.662) cm in height and 0.2 (95% CI [-0.3, 0.7]; p = 0.389) mm in knee-heel length. The main effects of WP were -0.08 (95% CI [-0.21, 0.05]; p = 220) cm and -0.2 (95% CI [-0.7; 0.3]; p = 403) mm, respectively. Interactions were found between WP and breastfeeding with respect to linear growth (p < 0.02), due to positive effects among breastfed and negative effects among non-breastfed children. Overall, LNS resulted in 0.56 (95% CI [0.42, 0.70]; p < 0.001) cm height increase, corresponding to 0.17 (95% CI [0.13, 0.21]; p < 0.001) HAZ increase, and 0.21 (95% CI [0.14, 0.28]; p < 0.001) kg weight increase, of which 76.5% (95% CI [61.9; 91.1]) was fat-free mass. Using height-adjusted indicators, LNS increased FFMI (0.07 kg/m2, 95% CI [0.0001; 0.13]; p = 0.049), but not FMI (0.01 kg/m2, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.12]; p = 0.800). Main limitations were lack of blinding of caregivers and short study duration. CONCLUSIONS: Adding dairy to LNS has no additional effects on linear growth or body composition in stunted children aged 12 to 59 months. However, supplementation with LNS, irrespective of milk, supports linear catch-up growth and accretion of fat-free mass, but not fat mass. If left untreated, children already on a stunting trajectory gain fat at the expense of fat-free mass, thus nutrition programs to treat such children should be considered.

This study aims to determine the factors including COVID-19 affecting formula compliance of CMPA patients. METHODS: This study is a prospective, observational study based on 10 different Paediatric Allergy-Immunology clinics in Turkey. Patients aged between 6 months and 2 years, who were followed up with IgE-mediated CMPA treatment or newly diagnosed and using breast milk and/or formula were included in the study. The sociodemographic characteristics of the patients, their symptoms, the treatments they received, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adherence to formula were evaluated with a questionnaire administered to the parents. RESULTS: The compliance rate for formula-based treatment was 30.8% (IQR: 28.3, SD: 21.86). The number of patients with a single and multiple food allergy was 127 (51.6%) and 71 (28.9%), respectively. Breastfeeding duration, daily amount of prescribed formula and addition of sweetener to the formula were found to reduce compliance (p = 0.010, p = 0.003, and p = 0.004, respectively). However, it was determined that the patient's height, weight, age at diagnosis, and age of formula onset did not have a significant effect on compliance. CONCLUSION: It was found that the duration of breastfeeding, the increase in the daily amount of formula requirement, and the addition of sweeteners had adverse effects on formula compliance. There was no significant correlation between the formula adherence of CMPA patients and the pandemic."

Metabolic syndrome is a medical condition in which individuals suffer from high blood pressure, high blood glucose levels, and obesity. The in vitro and in vivo bioactivities of dairy milk protein-derived peptides (MPDP) have proven their potential as an excellent natural alternative to the current medical treatment for metabolic syndrome. In this context, the review discussed the major protein source of dairy milk and provides current knowledge on the novel and integrated approach to MPDP production. A detailed comprehensive discussion is provided on the current state of knowledge regarding the in vitro and in vivo bioactivities of MPDP against metabolic syndrome. In addition, the most important aspect of digestive stability, allergenicity, and further directions for MPDP application is provided. RECENT FINDINGS: The major proteins found in milk are casein and whey, while a minor portion of serum albumin and transferrin are reported. Upon gastrointestinal digestion or enzymatic hydrolysis, these proteins produce peptides with various biological activities including antioxidative, antiinflammatory, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and antihypercholesterolemic, which could help in ameliorating metabolic syndrome. Bioactive MPDP has the potential to curtail metabolic syndrome and potentially act as a safe replacement for chemical drugs with fewer side effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is a common allergy in infants and can affect proper growth and development. This study verified factors associated with the evolution of the nutritional status (NS) among infants with CMPA fed with hypoallergenic formulas (HF). METHODS: This is a longitudinal study of infants (n = 1036) participating on a governmental program in Brazil. Researchers assessed Nutritional status before HF treatment (T1) and after HF treatment (T2). The causality of exposure variables on the evolution of NS was verified by Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). RESULTS: We observed an increase in anthropometric indexes analyzed with statistically significant results (p < 0.01). The weight/age and height/age scores showed a significant reduction in infants with nutritional deficit. The Body Mass Index (BMI) showed a decrease in the number of infants with nutritional deficit (< -2 z-score). On the other hand, there was an increase in those classified as at risk of overweight, overweight and obese. MLR showed that those who remained < 12 months in the program had a lower odds ratio (95% CI = 0.355-0.906; p = 0.018) to have inadequate NS with increasing BMI. Preterm infants were 4 times more likely (CI 95% = 1.520-10.694; p = 0.005) to have their BMI decreased and those who received nutritional counseling had a lower odds ratio (CI 95% = 0.411-0.953; p = 0.029) to maintain adequate NS. CONCLUSION: The program has a significant impact on the NS of infants with CMPA. The constant management and implementation of differentiated criteria according to the evolution of NS for the supply of HF is fundamental in the continuity of this public policy."

Micellar casein concentrate (MCC) and milk protein concentrate (MPC) containing about 7.5% protein were produced from pasteurized skim milk using a 3×, 3-stage ceramic microfiltration process and a 3×, 3-stage polymeric ultrafiltration membrane process, respectively. The MCC and MPC were each split into 6 batches, based on thermal process and addition of DKP. The 6 batches were no postfiltration heat treatment with added DKP (0.15%), no postfiltration heat without added DKP (0%), postfiltration high-temperature, short time (HTST) with DKP, postfiltration HTST without DKP, postfiltration direct steam injection with DKP, and postfiltration direct steam injection without DKP. The 6 MCC milk-based beverages and the 6 MPC milk-based beverages were stored at 4°C. Viscosity, color, and sensory properties were determined over 15 d of refrigerated storage. MCC- and MPC-based beverages at 7.5% protein with and without 0.15% added dipotassium phosphate were successfully run through an HTST and direct steam injection thermal process. The 7.5% protein MCC-based beverage contained a higher calcium and phosphorus content (2,425 and 1,583 mg/L, respectively) than the 7.5% protein MPC-based beverages (2,141 and 1,338 mg/L, respectively). Pasteurization (HTST) had very little effect on beverage particle size distribution, whereas direct steam injection thermal processing produced protein aggregates with medians in the range of 10 and 175 μm for MPC beverages. A population of casein micelles at about 0.15 μm was found in both MCC- and MPC-based beverages. Larger particles in the 175-μm range were not detected in the MCC beverages. In general, the apparent viscosity (AV) of MCC beverages was higher than MPC beverages. Added DKP increased the AV of both MCC- and MPC-based beverages, while increasing heat treatment decreased AV. The AV of beverages with DKP increased during 15 d of 4°C of storage for both MCC and MPC, whereas there was very little change in AV during storage without DKP and a similar effect was observed for sensory viscosity scores. The L value of beverages was higher with higher heat treatment, but DKP addition decreased L value and sensory opacity greatly. Sulfur-eggy flavors were detected in MPC beverages, but not MCC-based beverages.",

Though the cornerstone of management involves the strict avoidance of milk products while awaiting natural tolerance, research increasingly shows that the rates of resolution are slowing down. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative pathways to promote tolerance to cow's milk in pediatric populations. This review aims to combine and appraise the scientific literature regarding the three CMPA management methods: avoidance, the milk ladder, and oral immunotherapy (OIT) and their outcomes in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunological effects. Cow's milk (CM) avoidance virtually protects against allergic reaction until natural tolerance occurs, with hypoallergenic substitutes available in the market, but accidental ingestion represents the main issue for this strategy. Introduction to baked milk using the milk ladder was designed, with most CMPA patients successfully completing the ladder. Similar to baked milk treatment, many OIT protocols also demonstrated decreased IgE and increased IgG4 levels post protocol, as well as a reduction in wheal size diameter. Though these strategies are shown to be safe and effective in CMPA, future clinical trials should compare the safety and effectiveness of these three management strategies.",

Despite significant applications, only limited investigations are available on the application of BNBs in food processing. In the present study, a continuous acoustic cavitation technique was used to generate bulk nanobubbles (BNBs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of BNB incorporation on the processability and spray drying of milk protein concentrate (MPC) dispersions. MPC powders were reconstituted to the desired total solids and incorporated with BNBs using acoustic cavitation as per the experimental design. The control MPC (C-MPC) and BNB-incorporated MPC (BNB-MPC) dispersions were analyzed for rheological, functional, and microstructural properties. The viscosity significantly decreased (p < 0.05) at all the amplitudes studied. The microscopic observations of BNB-MPC dispersions showed less aggregated microstructures and greater structural differences compared with C-MPC dispersions, therefore lowering the viscosity. The viscosity of BNB incorporated (90% amplitude) MPC dispersions at 19% total solids at a shear rate of 100 s-1 significantly decreased to 15.43 mPa·s (C-MPC: 201 mPa·s), a net decrease in viscosity by ~90% with the BNB treatment. The control and BNB incorporated MPC dispersions were spray-dried, and the resultant powders were characterized in terms of powder microstructure and rehydration characteristics. Focused beam reflectance measurement of the BNB-MPC powders indicated higher counts of fine particles (<10 μm) during dissolution, signifying that BNB-MPC powders exhibited better rehydration properties than the C-MPC powders. The enhanced powder rehydration with the BNB incorporation was attributed to the powder microstructure. Overall, reducing the viscosity of feed by BNB incorporation can enhance the performance of the evaporator. This study, therefore, recommends the possibility of using BNB treatment for more efficient drying while improving the functional properties of the resultant MPC powders."

METHODS: CMA children underwent 45 days of treatment with Bifidobacteria. The basophil degranulation and the immune phenotype of B cells, T helper cells, and regulatory T cells were analyzed in peripheral blood at diagnosis (T0), after a 45-day probiotic treatment (T1), and 45 days after the probiotic wash-out (T2). RESULTS: We observed in probiotic-treated CMA patients a decrease in naive T lymphocytes. Among the CD3+ cell subsets, both naive and activated CD4+ cells resulted markedly reduced after taking probiotics, with the lowest percentages at T2. A decreased basophil degranulation was observed in response to all analyzed CMP at T1 compared to T0. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic treatment resulted in a decrease of circulating naive and activated CD4+ T cells, as well as degranulating basophils. These data suggest that the Bifidobacteria could have a beneficial effect in the modulation of oral tolerance to CMP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN69069358.

IMPACT: Probiotic treatment with Bifidobacteria induces a reduction of both naive and activated circulating CD4+ T cells in pediatric patients with cow's milk allergy (CMA). The probiotic supplementation induces a decreased basophil degranulation. The immunological tolerance persists even after 45 days of the probiotic wash-out. Bifidobacteria in vivo supplementation down-modulates the activation of innate and adaptive immunity in pediatric patients with cow's milk allergy.

In this randomised controlled intervention study, we aimed to investigate the tolerance induction of a novel heated cow milk protein, the iAGE product, in 18 children with CMA (diagnosed by a paedriatric allergist). Children who tolerated the iAGE product were included. The treatment group (TG: n = 11; mean age 12.8 months, SD = 4.7) consumed the iAGE product daily with their own diet, and the control group (CG: n = 7; mean age 17.6 months, SD = 3.2) used an eHF without any milk consumption. In each group, 2 children had multiple food allergies. The follow-up procedures consisted of a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with CM t = 0, t = 1 (8 months), t = 2 (16 months), and t = 3 (24 months). At t = 1, eight (73%) of 11 children in the TG had a negative DBPCFC, versus four out of seven (57%) in the CG (BayesFactor = 0.61). At t = 3, nine of the 11 (82%) children in the TG and five of seven (71%) in the CG were tolerant (BayesFactor = 0.51).

In-situ crosslinking gels that are flexibly adapting to the wound shape have a promising potential, but it is still hard to achieve fast gelation, on-demand adhesion, and wide feasibility at the same time. METHODS: A white-light crosslinkable natural milk-derived casein hydrogel bioadhesive is presented for the first time. Benefiting from abundant tyrosine residues, casein hydrogel bioadhesive was synthesized by forming di-tyrosine bonds under white light with a ruthenium-based catalyst. We firstly optimized the concentration of proteins and initiators to achieve faster gelation and higher mechanical strength. Then, we examined the degradation, cytotoxicity, tissue adhesion, hemostasis, and wound healing ability of the casein hydrogels to study their potential to be used as bioadhesives. RESULT: Rapid gelation of casein hydrogel is initiated with an outdoor flashlight, a cellphone flashlight, or an endoscopy lamp, which facilitates its usage during first-aid and minimally invasive operations. The rapid gelation enables 3D printing of the casein hydrogel and excellent hemostasis even during liver hemorrhage due to section injury. The covalent binding between casein and tissue enables robust adhesion which can withstand more than 180 mmHg blood pressure. Moreover, the casein-based hydrogel can facilitate post-traumatic wound healing caused by trauma due to its biocompatibility. CONCLUSION: Casein-based bioadhesives developed in this study pave a way for broad and practical application in emergency wound management."

METHODS: A global decision tree model was adapted to compare estimated costs in current practice (extensively hydrolyzed formula [eHF] or soy formula [SF] with the proposed approach of early introduction of AAF as first-line treatment of CMPA in non-breast-fed infants). Model inputs were derived from explorative literature reviews and medical experts' opinions. All costs were reported in local currency, ie, Saudi Riyal (SAR) for KSA, Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD) for Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) for the UAE. RESULTS: Cost savings with the early introduction of AAF were 10% (SAR 15102542) in KSA, 10% (KWD 306565) in Kuwait, 17% (AED 1842018) in the UAE government sector and 13% (AED 4232932) in the UAE private sector. The highest cost reduction was observed in the cost of soy formula (SF), with a 58% reduction both in KSA (SAR 4204540) and UAE public sector (AED 110331). A significant cost reduction in medication costs in Kuwait (37%; KWD 5630) and medical examination costs in the UAE private sector (50%; AED 1508918) was observed. CONCLUSION: Results indicated that the introduction of AAF as the first line in the management of CMPA is a cost-saving strategy for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries-KSA, Kuwait, and UAE- from a health-care payer's perspective."

      "abstract": "Notwithstanding mass vaccination against specific SARS-CoV-2 variants, there is still a demand for complementary nutritional intervention strategies to fight COVID-19. The bovine milk protein lactoferrin (LF) has attracted interest of nutraceutical, food and dairy industries for its numerous properties-ranging from anti-viral and anti-microbial to immunological-making it a potential functional ingredient in a wide variety of food applications to maintain health. Importantly, bovine LF was found to exert anti-viral activities against several types of viruses, including certain SARS-CoV-2 variants. LF's potential effect on COVID-19 patients has seen a rapid increase of in vitro and in vivo studies published, resulting in a model on how LF might play a role during different phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aim of this narrative review is two-fold: (1) to highlight the most relevant findings concerning LF's anti-viral, anti-microbial, iron-binding, immunomodulatory, microbiota-modulatory and intestinal barrier properties that support health of the two most affected organs in COVID-19 patients (lungs and gut), and (2) to explore the possible underlying mechanisms governing its mode of action. Thanks to its potential effects on health, bovine LF can be considered a good candidate for nutritional interventions counteracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and related COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

Control MPC powders (C-MPC; no MNB treatment) and MNB-treated MPC powders (MNB-MPC; MPC dispersions passed through the MNB system and subsequently spray dried) were characterized in terms of particle size, shape factors, stability, variable flow rate, shear cell tests, compressibility, and wall friction. The MPC powders produced after the MNB injection process had better flowability and lower basic flow energy. Shear tests showed that C-MPC powders were more cohesive than MNB-MPC powders. The MNB-MPC powders had lower flow rate index values, lower wall friction angles, more rounded shape, and significant differences in powder compressibility compared with C-MPC powders. Overall, the results demonstrated that MNB incorporation during spray drying can produce ingredients with comparable morphological characteristics while improving the bulk powder properties."

      "abstract": "Dairy ingredients with highly concentrated protein contents are high added value products with expanding market. The manufacture of such ingredients includes a succession of unit operations of which heat treatment is a key step to guarantee the microbial safety, that induces major changes in protein structures and thus ingredients functionalities. However, due to an incomplete understanding of phenomena taking place at high protein concentrations, shedding light on their mechanisms is a scientific challenge as well as an industrial need. In this study, the influence of heat treatment (74 °C/ 30 s) of highly concentrated milk protein systems (up to 20 % w/w) on protein denaturation/aggregation and enzymatic coagulation properties was studied using an original semi-industrial approach. 10 % w/w protein solutions constituted with whey protein and casein micelles at milk ratio, standardized in osmosed water or ultrafiltration permeate were used. These protein solutions were processed in different ways prior the manufacture of powders: heat treatment of the 10 % w/w protein solution before vacuum evaporation, heat treatment of the 20 % w/w protein solution after vacuum concentration, two consecutive heat treatments before and after vacuum evaporation. A fourth powder was prepared from unheated 10 % w/w protein solution. An increase in protein concentration led to a higher heat-induced protein denaturation. This phenomenon was reduced when increasing the lactose content. The effect of heat treatment on the extent of protein denaturation was not cumulative. At high protein concentration, interactions between κ-casein and whey protein were modified compared to milk, as mainly micelle-bound aggregates were formed at pH about 6.7. This phenomenon was enhanced at low ionic strength and lactose content. Our study showed that the enzymatic coagulation properties of reconstituted protein powders could be correlated with their physico-chemical compositions. An increase in protein denaturation disrupted the gel reorganization and led to the formation of weaker gels but did not interfere on the micelles aggregation phase and the early gelation. On the contrary, an increase in ionic strength and lactose content led to higher gel time.",

      "abstract": "Fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine ≤ 75 mg/100 g (except potatoes) have little impact on blood phenylalanine in phenylketonuria (PKU). In a randomized, controlled, crossover intervention trial, we examined the effect of increasing phenylalanine intake from fruits and vegetables, containing phenylalanine 76−100 mg /100 g, compared with milk protein sources on blood phenylalanine control. This was a five-phase study (4 weeks each phase). In Phase A, patients remained on their usual diet and then were randomly allocated to start Phase B and C (an additional phenylalanine intake of 50 mg/day, then 100 mg from fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76−100 mg/100 g) or Phase D and E (an additional phenylalanine intake of 50 mg/day then 100 mg/day from milk sources). There was a 7-day washout with the usual phenylalanine-restricted diet between Phase B/C and D/E. Blood phenylalanine was measured on the last 3 days of each week. If four out of six consecutive blood phenylalanine levels were >360 μmol/L in one arm, this intervention was stopped. Sixteen patients (median age 10.5 y; range 6−12 y) were recruited. At baseline, a median of 6 g/day (range: 3−25) natural protein and 60 g/day (range: 60−80) protein equivalent from protein substitute were prescribed. Median phenylalanine levels were: Phase A—240 μmol/L; Phase B—260 μmol/L; Phase C—280 μmol/L; Phase D—270 μmol/L and Phase E—280 μmol/L. All patients tolerated an extra 50 mg/day of phenylalanine from fruit and vegetables, containing phenylalanine 76−100 mg/100 g, but only 11/16 (69%) tolerated an additional 100 mg /day. With milk protein, only 8/16 (50%) tolerated an extra 50 mg/day and only 5/16 (31%) tolerated an additional 100 mg/day of phenylalanine. Tolerance was defined as maintaining consistent blood phenylalanine levels < 360 μmol/L throughout each study arm. There was a trend that vegetable protein had less impact on blood phenylalanine control than milk protein, but overall, the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.152). This evidence supports the PKU European Guidelines cutoff that fruit and vegetables containing 76−100 mg phenylalanine/100 g should be calculated as part of the phenylalanine exchange system. Tolerance of the ‘free use’ of these fruits and vegetables depends on inter-patient variability but cannot be recommended for all patients with PKU.",

Several cases of PLE combined with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA) have been reported in infants and toddlers that were considered to result from excessive cow's milk consumption, although the mechanism has not been clearly established. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and radiologic characteristics of patients diagnosed and treated for PLE with IDA between 2015 and 2021. Long-term outcomes were analyzed according to dietary intervention during the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients aged 7.0-26.7 months were enrolled in the study and the median follow-up duration of them was 9.4 months (range, 1.3-18.0). Six of them were fed powdered formula, while two were fed whole cow's milk, and their median daily intake was 700 mL (range, 300-900). The times to normalization of hemoglobin, albumin, and eosinophil count were shorter in patients with dietary elimination of cow's milk protein immediately after diagnosis compared to those with reduced intake or no dietary change. CONCLUSION: Early complete elimination of cow's milk protein should be considered, especially if the laboratory parameters are not normalized with adequate iron supplementation even though the clinical symptoms show improvement. We would like to draw attention to the possibility of the cow's milk protein in the pathogenesis of the condition through the non-IgE-mediated immune reactions.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Microbial challenge studies using nonpathogenic surrogates provide a practical means for validating thermally based pathogen controls for low-moisture foods. Because the relative thermal resistance, or kill ratio, of Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 (a nonpathogenic surrogate) to Salmonella is greatly influenced by food composition, this study assessed relative thermal resistance of a five-strain Salmonella cocktail and E. faecium in skim milk powder (SMP), lactose-free skim milk powder (LSMP), 90% milk protein isolate (MPI), and lactose powder (LP). The impact of sugar composition (lactose versus glucose-galactose) on resuscitation of bacterial survivors, by using SMP and LSMP, was also determined. Dairy powders were inoculated with agar-grown cultures, mixed, preequilibrated at 0.25 water activity (aw), ground to achieve homogeneity, reequilibrated, and subjected to isothermal treatment. After enumeration on nonselective differential media, log-linear and Bigelow models were fit to the survivor data via one-step global regression. The aw changes and glass transition temperature were assessed at elevated temperatures by using uninoculated, equilibrated powder samples. Estimated D90°C-values were approximately two times higher for E. faecium (P < 0.05) than for Salmonella in SMP, LP, and MPI, but statistically similar (P > 0.05) in LSMP. Addition of sugars to recovery media did not influence survivor resuscitation from heat-treated SMP and LSMP, confirming that microbial inactivation was impacted primarily by the thermal treatment, not the recovery step. Thermally induced changes in aw were seen only for LP and MPI, with the glass transition temperature observed only for SMP and MPI. In conclusion, rather than always requiring greater lethality of E. faecium than Salmonella, these findings suggest that sufficient pathogen controls for low-moisture foods can also be validated by thoroughly documenting the appropriate kill ratios of E. faecium to Salmonella.",

The outcomes were anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference), adherence to the study formula and occurrence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Fifteen children [all Caucasian and born at term; 53.3% born with spontaneous delivery; 80% male; 80% with familial allergy risk; mean age (±SD) 3 ± 2.5 months at IgE-mediated CMPA diagnosis; mean age (±SD) 16.7 ± 5.9 months at enrolment, mean total serum IgE (±SD) 298.2 ± 200.4 kU/L] were included and completed the 6-month study. Data from fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy controls were also adopted as comparison. At baseline, all CMPA patients were weaned and were receiving the new AAF. All 15 patients completed the 6-month study period. For the entire CMPA pediatric patients' cohort, from baseline to the end of the study period, the body growth pattern resulted within the normal range of World Health Organization (WHO) growth references and resulted similar to healthy controls anthropometric values. The formula was well tolerated. The adherence was optimal and no AEs related to AAF use were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The new AAF ensured normal growth in subjects affected by IgE-mediated CMPA. This formula constitutes another suitable safe option for the management of pediatric patients affected by CMPA."

Fecal samples were collected, and the composition of the gut bacteria was analyzed by whole genome sequencing using long-read sequencing. Gene expression studies of the immunomodulatory cytokines involved and quantification of sIgA were carried out. IL-6 and IFN-γ were downregulated by about 0.17 ± 0.06 and 0.12 ± 0.10 fold when supplemented with whey protein hydrolysate in SP-RWC rats and by about 0.02 ± 0.06 and 0.35 ± 0.12 fold when using buffalo milk hydrolysate. The percentage of Firmicutes decreased in M.PEM and S.PEM rats (33.57%, 28.83 versus 47.73% of control at 3 weeks) but increased upon protein replenishment for all three protein sources at the end of nine weeks. The percentage of Bacteroidetes increased to 31.03% in S.PEM-induced rats as against 28.17% in control rats. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus sp. decreased in M.PEM and S.PEM rats while it showed the opposite effect upon protein replenishment. Gut microbiota modulated the pathogenesis of PEM differentially based on protein intervention along with a significant increase in the relative abundance of the keystone Lactobacillus genus.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A on diagnosing and monitoring CMPA in children for clinical treatment. METHODS: A total of 158 infants with CMPA and 89 healthy babies were recruited and evaluated. Demographic and clinical information of all participants were recorded. An extensive analysis of inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A, was performed in blood samples from 247 infants younger than 9 months. Meanwhile, the serological specificity immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels were evaluated. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) values of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A in differentiating CMP from healthy babies were measured by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, the correlation between sIgE and IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A levels were detected using Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: Compared with healthy control, infants who developed CMPA had decreased IL-12, increased IL-16, and IL-17A. Moreover, a significant correlation between serum IL-12, IL-16, IL-17A and sIgE levels was observed in the CMPA group. In addition, AUC values of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A in discriminating CMPA from healthy infants were 0.8425, 0.9196, and 0.8813, respectively. Finally, IL-12 was increased while IL-16 and IL-17A levels were decreased in the CMPA group after three months of milk avoidance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We found that IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A levels in children with CMPA were associated with SCORAD scores, sIgE levels, and disease severity, functioning as valuable disease-monitor markers in CMPA.",

Fecal calprotectin (FC) has been reported as a biomarker for CMPA. Therefore, the meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the value of FC in the diagnosis and monitoring of CMPA. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to April 2022 were searched for relevant studies. Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using the forest plot. Heterogeneity was used to determine the fixed or random-effect model. RESULTS: Twelve studies including 310 patients and 217 controls were available for the meta-analysis. The FC levels in children with CMPA were significantly higher than in healthy control (SMD = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.38-1.91). After elimination diet treatment, FC levels were reduced considerably with the pooled SMD of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.48-1.26). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that FC could be a simple and reliable biomarker for diagnosing CMPA, especially in non-IgE-mediated CMPA infants. Besides, calprotectin was also potential for predicting therapy response of CMPA.",

Rennet casein (RCN) is the preferred ingredient to provide intact casein in a formulation. Ingredients produced using membrane technology, such as milk protein concentrate (MPC) and micellar casein concentrate (MCC), are unable to provide the required functionality. However, the use of transglutaminase (TGase) has potential to modify the physical properties of MPC or MCC and may improve their functionality in IMC. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of TGase-treated MPC and MCC retentates on melt and stretch properties when they are used in IMC and to compare them with IMC made using RCN. The MCC and MPC retentates were produced using 3 different lots of pasteurized skim milk and treated with 3 levels of TGase enzyme: no TGase (control), low TGase: 0.3 units/g of protein, and high TGase: 3.0 units/g of protein. Each of the MCC and MPC treatments was heated to 72°C for 10 min to inactivate TGase and then spray dried. Each MCC, MPC, and RCN powder was then used in an IMC formulation that was standardized to 48% moisture, 21% fat, 20% protein, and 1% salt. The IMC were manufactured in a twin-screw cooker by blending, mixing, and heating various ingredients (4.0 kg). Due to extensive crosslinking, the IMC formulation with the highest TGase level (MCC or MPC) did not form an emulsion. The IMC made from MCC treatments had significantly higher stretchability on pizza compared with their respective MPC treatments. The IMC made from TGase-treated MCC and MPC had significantly lower melt area and significantly higher transition temperature (TT) and stretchability compared with their respective controls. Comparison of IMC made using TGase-treated MCC and MPC to the RCN IMC indicated no difference in TT or texture profile analysis-stretchability; however, the Schreiber melt test area was significantly lower. Our results demonstrated that TGase treatment modifies the melt and stretch characteristics of MCC and MPC in IMC applications, and TGase-treated MPC and MCC can be used to replace RCN in IMC formulations.",

      "abstract": "The amount of intact casein provided by dairy ingredients is a critical parameter in dairy-based imitation mozzarella cheese (IMC) formulation because it has a significant effect on unmelted textural parameters such as hardness. From a functionality perspective, rennet casein (RCN) is the preferred ingredient. Milk protein concentrate (MPC) and micellar casein concentrate (MCC) cannot provide the required functionality due to the higher steric stability of casein micelle. However, the use of transglutaminase (TGase) has the potential to modify the surface properties of MPC and MCC and may improve their functionality in IMC. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of TGase-treated MPC and MCC powders on the unmelted textural properties of IMC and compare them with IMC made using commercially available RCN. Additionally, we studied the degree of crosslinking by TGase in MPC and MCC retentates using capillary gel electrophoresis. Three lots of MCC and MPC retentate were produced from pasteurized skim milk via microfiltration and ultrafiltration, respectively, and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: no TGase (control); low TGase: 0.3 units/g of protein; and high TGase: 3.0 units/g of protein, followed by inactivation of enzyme (72°C for 10 min), and spray drying.

The IMC were manufactured by blending, mixing, and heating ingredients (4.0 kg) in a twin-screw cooker. The capillary gel electrophoresis analysis showed extensive inter- and intramolecular crosslinking. The IMC formulation using the highest TGase level in MCC or MPC did not form an emulsion because of extensive crosslinking. In MPC with a high level of TGase, whey protein and casein crosslinking were observed. In contrast, crosslinking and hydrolysis of proteins were observed in MCC. The IMC made from MCC powder had significantly higher texture profile analysis hardness compared with the corresponding MPC powder. Further, many-to-one (multiple) comparisons using the Dunnett test showed no significant differences between IMC made using RCN and treatment powders in hardness. Our results demonstrated that TGase treatment causes crosslinking hydrolysis of MCC and MPC at higher TGase levels, and MPC and MCC have the potential to be used as ingredients in IMC applications.",

However, the characteristics of plasma biomolecules in dairy cows with different long-term milk protein concentrations are not fully elucidated. This study was conducted to understand the mechanism of plasma proteins in milk protein synthesis by the comparative analysis of the plasma proteomics of cows with different milk protein concentrations. Three groups of Holstein cows (per group = 10) with low (LMP), medium (MMP), and high long-term milk protein concentrations (HMP) were selected for the experiment to determine plasma hormones, biochemical parameters, and proteome. We found that HMP cows had higher concentrations of plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), glucose, prolactin, insulin, and growth hormone than LMP cows. Additionally, plasma proteomic identified 91 differential proteins, including IGF-1 between the LMP and HMP groups, and the mTOR pathway was enriched. In vitro, IGF-1 treatment increased β-casein expression and simultaneously activated S6K1 and mTOR phosphorylation in bovine mammary epithelial cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate the differences in plasma hormones, biochemical parameters, and proteome of cows with different milk protein concentrations and indicate that IGF-1 enhanced milk protein synthesis, associated with activation of the mTOR signaling pathway."

Clinical status, metabolic acidosis and methaemoglobin level returned to normal following fluid resuscitation and methylene blue administration. The neonate was later managed with breast feeding and elemental formula. CMPA was diagnosed based on history and clinical improvement after elemental formula.

METHODS: The clinical data of 200 children with CMPA from our hospital from February 2020 to May 2021 were collected, and they were divided into a study group (n = 100) and a routine group (n = 100) based on different intervention modalities. The routine group received routine treatment, whereas the standardized dietary avoidance therapy was used in the study group. The clinical effects and related intestinal microflora indexes of the two groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of related symptoms between the two groups before intervention (P > 0.05), and the conditions of the two groups were improved after intervention. The incidences of skin (2%), digestive tract (3.00%), and respiratory tract (1.00%) in the study group were significantly lower than those in the routine group (14.00%, 18.00%, and 11.00%) (P > 0.05). The time taken for complete remission of symptoms and milk tolerance months in the study group (41.23 ± 23.68, 13.28 ± 6.17) were significantly shorter than those in the routine group (145.14 ± 66.74, 16.17 ± 8.05) (P > 0.05). The values of height, weight, and head circumference (HC) of children in the study group (79.88 ± 2.18, 11.09 ± 1.34, 47.88 ± 0.63) were higher than those in the routine group (76.21 ± 2.34, 9.81 ± 1.18, 45.98 ± 0.59) (P > 0.05). The levels of Lactobacillus and Enterococcus (9.95 ± 0.89, 11.31 ± 1.05) in the study group were higher than those in the routine group (9.11 ± 0.74, 10.38 ± 0.94), and the levels of yeast-like fungi in the study group (3.08 ± 0.24) were lower than those of the routine group (3.82 ± 0.31) (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The standardized dietary avoidance therapy is remarkable in the treatment of CMPA, in which the children were able to tolerate ordinary milk earlier, and the intestinal flora was significantly improved, thereby promoting the growth and development of children. It therefore merits clinical promotion."

MAC-T cells were seeded using 10-cm dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (DMEM/F12) basic medium. The basic medium of DMEM/F12 was replaced with the lactogenic DMEM/F12 differentiation medium when 90% of MAC-T cells reached confluency. The best dosage at 0.6 mM of D-Met and HMBi and incubation time at 72 h were used uniformly for all treatments. Each treatment was replicated six times wherein treatments were randomly assigned in a 6-well plate. Cell, medium, and total protein were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. Genes, proteomics and metabolomics analyses were also done to determine the mechanism of the milk protein synthesis pathway. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with supplement type and plate as fixed effects. The least significant difference test was used to evaluate the differences among treatments. The HMBi treatment group had the highest beta-casein and S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) mRNA gene expression levels. HMBi and D-Met treatments have higher gene expressions compared to the control group. In terms of medium protein content, HMBi had a higher medium protein quantity than the control although not significantly different from the D-Met group. HMBi supplementation stimulated the production of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit protein essential for protein translation initiation resulting in higher medium protein synthesis in the HMBi group than in the control group. The protein pathway analysis results showed that the D-Met group stimulated fructose-galactose metabolism, glycolysis pathway, phosphoinositide 3 kinase, and pyruvate metabolism. The HMBi group stimulated the pentose phosphate and glycolysis pathways. Metabolite analysis revealed that the D-Met treatment group increased seven metabolites and decreased uridine monophosphate (UMP) production. HMBi supplementation increased the production of three metabolites and decreased UMP and N-acetyl-L-glutamate production. Taken together, D-Met and HMBi supplementation are effective in stimulating milk protein synthesis in MAC-T cells by genes, proteins, and metabolites stimulation linked to milk protein synthesis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of partially hydrolyzed formulas (pHF) as part of nutritional interventions to prevent the development of allergic manifestations (AM) is questioned, and efficacy of each specific pHF should be substantiated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk-reduction effect of a whey-based pHF on the development of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) and atopic dermatitis (AD) in infants at high-risk for allergy within the first 6 months of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a multicenter double-blinded randomized controlled setting, healthy non-exclusively breastfed full-term infants, received either a specific whey-based pHF or a standard cow's milk-based formula (SF) and were clinically assessed for AM at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, supported by the objective scoring tools SCORAD and CoMiSS. CMPA was confirmed by open food challenge. Intention-to-Treat (ITT) and Per-Protocol (PP) analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 331 randomized subjects (ITT analysis set), 160 received the pHF and 171 the SF. Six (3.8%) infants in the pHF and 12 (7%) in the SF group developed CMPA (p = 0.186). AD incidence was significantly lower in those receiving pHF as compared to SF (10.6% vs. 18.7%, p = 0.024) with a relative risk (RR, 95% CI) of 0.54 (0.32, 0.92), in particular when adjusting for family history of AD [6.5% vs. 27.3%, RR 0.24 (0.07, 0.78), p = 0.018] representing a risk reduction of 76%. The PP analysis showed similar results. CONCLUSION: This specific whey-based pHF reduced the risk of AD development, particularly in those with a family history of AD, and tended to reduce the development of CMPA in non-exclusively breastfed infants at high-risk for allergy. The A.R.T. study suggests that this particular pHF may contribute to measures aimed at prevention of allergic manifestations. However, further studies are needed to confirm this risk-reduction effect."

Term infants aged 1-8 months with moderate-to-severe CMPA were enrolled. The study formula was an AAF supplemented with 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT). Infants were fed the study formula for 4 months and were offered to remain on the formula until 12 months of age. Tolerance and safety were assessed throughout the trial. Out of 32 infants (mean age 18.6 weeks; 20 (62.5%) male), 29 completed the trial. During the 4-month principal study period, the mean weight-for-age Z score (WAZ) increased from -0.31 at the baseline to +0.28 at the 4-months' follow-up. Linear and head growth also progressed along the WHO child growth reference, with a similar small upward trend. The formula was well tolerated and had an excellent safety profile. When comparing the microbiome at the baseline to the subsequent visits, there was a significant on-treatment enrichment in HMO-utilizing bifidobacteria, which was associated with a significant increase in fecal short-chain fatty acids. In addition, we observed a significant reduction in the abundance of fecal Proteobacteria, suggesting that the HMO-supplemented study formula partially corrected the gut microbial dysbiosis in infants with CMPA.",

      "abstract": "Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most frequent cause of food allergy in the first months of life. Despite the fact that there are different guidelines and recommendations on the management of children with CMPA, there continues to be great variability in diagnostic and therapeutic criteria in Latin America. The Food Allergy Working Group of the Latin American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition summoned a group of Latin American experts to reach a consensus and formulate a document to unify diagnostic and therapeutic criteria for CMPA. Three teams were formed, each with a coordinator, and the members of each team developed a series of statements for their corresponding module: a) clinical manifestations and diagnosis; b) diagnostic tools, and c) treatment. A search of the medical literature was carried out to support the information presented in each module and 28 statements were then selected. The statements were discussed, after which they were evaluated by all the experts, utilizing the Delphi method. Their opinions on statement agreement or disagreement were anonymously issued. The final statements selected were those with above 75% agreement and their corresponding recommendations were formulated, resulting in the document presented herein.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The present international survey among healthcare providers aimed to collect data on theoretical knowledge and clinical practices in the diagnosis and management of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) and lactose intolerance (LI) in infants. METHODS: A global survey was conducted in several countries with diverse health care settings. The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions in 3 main domains: (1) understanding and clinical practices around CMPA and LI; (2) case scenarios; and (3) disease-specific knowledge and potential educational needs. RESULTS: Responses were available from 1,663 participants. About 62% of respondents were general practitioners or general pediatricians, and the remainder were pediatric allergists/gastroenterologists (18%) or other health practitioners (20%). The survey identified knowledge gaps regarding the types of CMPA (IgE-mediated vs. non-IgE-mediated) and the clinical overlap with LI. The survey suggested diverse clinical practices regarding the use of hypoallergenic formulas, as well as misconceptions about the prebiotic benefits of lactose in extensively hydrolyzed formulas in non-breastfed infants with CMPA. Responses to the two case scenarios highlighted varying levels of awareness of the relevant clinical practice guidelines. While respondents generally felt confident in managing infants with CMPA and LI, about 80% expressed an interest for further training in this area. CONCLUSION: The current survey identified some knowledge gaps and regional differences in the management of infants with CMPA or LI. Local educational activities among general and pediatric healthcare providers may increase the awareness of clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of both conditions and help improve clinical outcomes."

      "abstract": "Oyster meat has a tender texture and delicate flavor, and the oyster is an aquatic shellfish with high nutritional and economic values. As they are rich in protein, oysters serve as a good source for the preparation of bioactive peptides. However, research on the lactation effect and mechanism of the synthesis of polypeptides from oyster hydrolysates is yet to be observed. This study aimed to analyze the lactation activity of the fraction UEC4-1 and explore its mechanism. The results show that, in an in vivo experiment, UEC4-1 could significantly increase the concentration of PRL in the serum and mammary tissue and the concentration of PRLR in the mammary tissue in rats with postpartum hypogalactia. UEC4-1 promoted the development of mammary tissue structure, resulting in active lactation. UEC4-1 promoted the proliferation of MCF-10A in a dose-dependent manner and could significantly upregulate the gene expression levels of PRL, PRLR, CSN1S1, CSN2, CSN3 and CCND1. UEC4-1 could also significantly increase the expression of mTOR, AKT1, RPS6KB1 and STAT5A in MCF-10A and improve its phosphorylation level. These results show that UEC4-1 had the ability to upregulate the proliferation and PRL synthesis of MCF-10A and promote lactation. The ability of UEC4-1 to regulate the milk-protein synthesis signaling pathway is the mechanism behind this. Oysters had a remarkable effect on lactating mothers' sweating irritability after childbirth and may serve as an everyday diet to promote lactation. Postpartum dysgalactia is a common problem for lactating women. The study of the oyster's lactation-active peptide can provide dietary nutrition guidance for postpartum lactating mothers, and it has the potential to be used for the development of drugs for the treatment of postpartum hypogalactia or oligogalactia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is a clinical condition that requires appropriate nutritional counseling during breastfeeding and the introduction of complementary feeding. Using evidence-based dietetic advice is critical for correct growth and development during childhood. The aim of this study was to review the most recent literature on nutritional counseling aimed at infants between 0 and 2 y of age diagnosed with CMPA. METHODS: Six databases were searched and updated on August 22, 2020. Retrieved articles were screened in duplicate and independently by all the authors, and these were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: clinical trials, reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical practice guidelines published since 2013 on any dietetic intervention aimed at infant populations between 0 and 2 y of age with CMPA. Critical appraisal through the AGREE instrument and CASP tools enabled the risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: We obtained 2874 results, of which 40 were included for reviewing. The retrieved information enabled us to answer all the research questions, including aspects of the nutritional counseling aimed at mothers who breastfeed infants with CMPA, as well as infants during breastfeeding and the introduction of complementary feeding. We also reviewed the specific nutritional requirements of infants with CMPA to assess nutritional supplementation and the evidence available on the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review collected, in a structured and comprehensive way, the most recent available information regarding nutritional counseling in CMPA for a successful dietetic intervention of the casuistry that may arise during early infancy.",

Heat treatment of milk is a technological process designed to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and extend the shelf life of products. The heating process directly affects the molecular structure of whey proteins by the process of denaturation. It leads to the formation of a whey protein−casein polymer complex. Based on these facts, milk heat-treatment conditions should be controlled during milk processing. This work focuses on describing the whey protein denaturation process and formation of the complex of whey protein with casein. The effect of heat treatment on individual milk protein fractions alpha-casein (α-cas), beta-casein (β-cas), kappa-casein (κ-cas), beta-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and alpha-lactalbumin (α-la) was studied by SDS-PAGE. Formation of the whey protein−casein polymer complex increased significantly (p < 0.05) on increasing the temperature and duration of the heat treatment."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is known as the most common food allergy in the first year of life. For this purpose, in our review, the regulation of maternal and infant nutrition, and the risks and the issues to be considered in terms of nutrition are discussed from the perspective of a dietitian. RECENT FINDINGS: Therefore, understanding the epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and appropriate treatment of cow's milk protein allergy is crucial for the multidisciplinary team of physicians, dietitians, and nurses working in the clinic. It has been reported that tolerance develops in approximately 50% of infants affected by cow's milk protein in the first year of life. Although CMPA is generally thought to clear up between 1 and 2 years of age, there is insufficient evidence to determine an optimal time to reintroduce cow's milk protein to the diet. Because the elimination diet recommended in the treatment of children with CMPA, adequate protein and calcium intake of the mother and/or baby in the diet should be evaluated. Studies focusing on metabolic bone turnover in children with food allergies are limited. In general, low calcium intake is associated with reduced bone formation in children with CMPA. Therefore, bone health should be focused on and appropriate strategies should be developed in children with CMPA. Unnecessary elimination of milk and its products, which are an important part of nutrition, should be prevented and nutrient deficiencies and growth status should be monitored by dietitians especially working in the field of pediatric nutrition.",

      "abstract": "Micro- and nano-bubbles (MNB) have unique properties and have attracted great attention in the past 2 decades, offering prospective applications in various disciplines. The first objective of this study was to investigate whether venturi-style MNB generation is capable of producing sufficient bulk MNB. A nanoparticle tracking system was used to measure the bubble concentration and particle size of MNB-treated deionized water. The MNB-treated deionized water had a bubble concentration of 3.76 × 108 particles/mL (∼350 million bubbles/mL more compared with control) and a mean particle size of 249.8 nm. The second objective of this study was to investigate the effects of MNB treatment on the microstructure and functional properties of milk protein concentrate (MPC) dispersions. Reconstituted MPC dispersions (21%, wt/wt) without air injection were considered as control (C-MPC), and MPC dispersions passed through the MNB system were considered as MNB-treated (MNB-MPC) dispersions. Control and MNB-MPC dispersions were evaluated in terms of rheological behavior and microstructure. The microscopic observations of MNB-MPC dispersions showed less aggregated microstructures and greater structural differences compared with C-MPC dispersions, therefore lowering the viscosity. The viscosity of MNB-MPC at a shear rate of 100 s-1 significantly decreased to 57.58 mPa·s (C-MPC: 162.40 mPa·s), a net decrease in viscosity by ∼65% after MNB treatment. Additionally, MPC dispersions were spray dried after the MNB treatment, and the resultant MNB-MPC powders were characterized and compared with the control MPC in terms of rehydration characteristics and microstructure. Focused beam reflectance measurement of the MNB-MPC powders indicated lower counts of large particles (150-300 μm) during dissolution, signifying that MNB-MPC powders exhibited better rehydration properties than the C-MPC powders. This study, therefore, recommends the possibility of using MNB treatment for more efficient drying while improving the functional properties of the resultant MPC powders.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing demand for new strategies to tailor the texture of fat-free fermented concentrated milk products, also referred to as milk protein-based (MPb) microgel dispersions. Methods should be easy to incorporate into the production scheme, offer labelling without added components and be cost-efficient. Thermal treatments are traditionally used upstream (milk heating) and downstream (pre-concentration heating) in the production of these dispersions, though there is little knowledge as to the effects that combinations of different thermal input levels have on final texture. Therefore, this study investigated combinations of thermal input at different intensities and steps in the production scheme at the pilot scale and the relationships with texture. We demonstrated that increasing the intensity of upstream milk heat treatment, in combination with downstream pre-concentration heating, increases gel firmness and apparent viscosity. Downstream pre-concentration heating produces final fat-free fermented concentrated MPb microgel particles that are resistant to post-heating aggregation. On the other hand, omission of downstream pre-concentration heating results in smaller particles that are sensitive to post-heating aggregation. Furthermore, gel firmness and apparent viscosity increase with post-heating. Consequently, combining different levels of thermal inputs upstream, downstream (pre-concentration) and post-production, can produce fat-free fermented concentrated MPb microgel dispersions with a range of different textures."

We investigated the effect of milk protein versus blends of milk and rapeseed protein on plasma leptin and adiponectin in children. METHODS: We included 88 Danish 7- to 8-year-old children randomised to receive 35 g protein/day for 4 weeks in 2018 as either milk protein or blends of milk and rapeseed protein (ratio 54:46 or 30:70). Outcomes included absolute and fat mass-adjusted adiponectin and leptin measured at baseline, Weeks 1 and 4. RESULTS: There was no difference in changes in absolute and fat mass-adjusted adiponectin and leptin after 1 or 4 weeks between the three groups (p ≥ 0.100). Leptin increased within all groups (p ≤ 0.046). Combining the three groups, leptin and fat mass-adjusted leptin increased by 23% (95% CI 11;35) and 17% (6.4;29) during the intervention respectively (both p ≤ 0.001). Adiponectin variables did not change during the intervention period. CONCLUSION: There were no differences between milk protein and blends of milk and rapeseed protein on absolute and fat mass-adjusted leptin and adiponectin in healthy children with a habitual intake of milk. However, leptin increased within all three groups. Future studies should further investigate effect on appetite-related hormones of rapeseed protein alone.",

However, its role in the development of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) has not been elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate the function of A2AR in CMPA development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) to induce allergic responses. The model was assessed by detecting allergic responses and plasma-specific IgE levels. The levels of A2AR were measured by PCR and flow cytometry. The subpopulation of Treg cells was analysed. RESULTS: The mice sensitized and challenged with OVA showed classic allergic symptoms, such as acute allergic skin responses, increased anaphylactic shock symptom scores, and higher levels of total IgE, OVA-speciﬁc IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a. OVA-sensitized mice and CMPA patients showed decreased levels of A2AR and Treg cells. Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between A2AR expression and Treg levels in CMPA patients. Further study showed that the A2AR agonist CGS21680 blocked OVA-induced allergic reactions, and the A2AR antagonist KW-6002 amplified allergic responses. Interestingly, CGS21680 not only activated the A2AR-mediated signalling pathway but also caused an increase in the population of Treg cells. In contrast, KW-6002 therapy decreased the levels of Tregs in allergic mice. CONCLUSION: A2AR expression is downregulated in CMPA. The A2AR-mediated pathway negatively regulates the development of CMPA, at least in part, by amplifying the differentiation of Tregs."

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the functional properties of milk proteins and their structure upon microwave, ultrasound, and thermosonication treatments. The protein content, digestibility, and secondary-structure changes of milk proteins were determined. The results demonstrated that almost 35% of the proteins in the untreated samples had a α-helix structure and approximately 29% a β-sheet and turns structure. Regarding the untreated samples, the three treatments increased the α-helices and correspondingly decreased the β-sheets and turns. Moreover, the highest milk protein digestibility was observed for the ultrasound-treated samples (90.20-94.41%), followed by the microwave-treated samples (72.56-93.4%), whereas thermosonication resulted in a lower digestibility (68.76-78.81%). The milk protein content was reduced as the microwave processing time and the temperature increased. The final milk protein available in the sample was lower when microwave processing was conducted at 75 °C and 90 °C compared to 60 °C, whereas the ultrasound treatment significantly improved the protein content, and no particular trend was observed for the thermosonicated samples. Thus, ultrasound processing shows a potential application in improving the protein quality of cow's milk."

      "abstract": "This work evaluated the impact of high temperature short time (HTST, 72 °C, 15 s), high hydrostatic pressure (HHP, 400-600 MPa at 5 and 10 min) and Holder pasteurization (HoP, 62.5 °C, 30 min) on protein profile and aggregation in a human milk protein concentrate (HMPC). The structural changes induced in milk proteins were investigated in HMPC as well as in sedimentable and non-sedimentable fractions recovered after ultracentrifugation. The results showed that heat treatments induced more protein denaturation and aggregation than did HHP treatments. Indeed, heat-induced protein aggregates observed in HMPC and the sedimentable fraction were mainly composed of lactoferrin and α-lactalbumin. More specifically, the concentration of lactoferrin in HMPC decreased by 86% after HTST and HoP whereas no effect was observed after HHP treatment. These results show the potential of HHP processing as a pasteurization method for HMPC since it minimizes the impact on protein structure, which generally correlates to protein quality and bioactivity.",

      "abstract": "Mastitis is one of the most serious diseases that causes losses in the dairy industry, seriously impairing milk production and milk quality, and even affecting human health. Menthol is a cyclic monoterpene compound obtained from the stem and leaves of peppermint, which has a variety of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the preventive effect of menthol on the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in primary bovine mammary gland epithelial cells (BMECs) and its anti-inflammatory mechanism. First, BMECs were isolated and amplified from the udders of Holstein cows by enzymatic hydrolysis. BMECs were treated with menthol (10, 50, 100, 200 μM) for 1h, followed by lipopolysaccharide (5μg/ml) for 12 h. Lipopolysaccharide treatment upregulated the protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS) and the mRNA abundance of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), while menthol was able to inhibit this effect. The inhibitory effect of menthol on proinflammatory factors was significantly reduced when autophagy was blocked using 3-Methyladenine (5μg/ml), an inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide treatment reduced the expression levels of milk lipids and milk proteins, which were inhibited by menthol. In addition, menthol (200 μM) treatment was able to significantly upregulate the expression level of autophagy-related protein LC3B, downregulate the expression level of P62, promote the expression abundance of autophagy-related gene mRNA, and enhance significantly enhance autophagic flux. Interestingly, treatment of BMECs with menthol (200 μM) promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51 like kinase 1 (ULK1) and increased the nuclear localization of nuclear factor-E2 associated factor 2 (Nrf-2). When the AMPK pathway was blocked using compound C (10μg/ml), an inhibitor of AMPK, autophagy was significantly inhibited. Autophagy levels were significantly decreased after blocking the Nrf-2 pathway using ML385 (5μg/ml), an inhibitor of Nrf-2. Overall, the data suggest that menthol activates the AMPK-ULK1 pathway to initiate the onset of autophagy and maintains the level of autophagy through the AMPK-Nrf-2 pathway. In conclusion, the findings suggest that menthol may alleviate the inflammatory response in BMECs via the AMPK/ULK1/Nrf-2/autophagy pathway.",

The mimicking human fat emulsions were prepared using modified proteins and compound vegetable oil and the structural, emulsifying properties and encapsulation efficiency of emulsions were evaluated. After ultrasonic treatment, the cavitation caused particle size decreased and structure change of both MPL and MPC, resulting in the enhancement of protein solubility. While, there was no significant change in molecular weight. Modified proteins by ultrasonic may cause a reduction in particle size and an improvement in emulsifying stability and encapsulation efficiency of emulsions. The optimal ultrasonic time to improve functional properties of MPL emulsion and MPC emulsion were 3 min and 6 min, respectively. The emulsifying stability of MPL emulsion was superior to MPC emulsion, which indicated that MPL is more suitable as membrane material to simulate human fat. Therefore, the obtained results can provide basis for quality control of infant formula.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Milk protein allergy is one of the most common food allergies in infants. We aimed to test whether fecal calprotectin can be used to monitor food allergies in infants by comparing the fecal calprotectin levels in infants with a milk protein allergy before and after an intervention treatment. METHODS: The study was designed as a prospective case-control trial. Stool samples were collected at follow-up, and the concentration of fecal calprotectin was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The infant's weight and length were measured. RESULTS: The allergic group comprised 90 milk-allergic infants (41 boys, 49 girls), and the nonallergic group comprised 90 nonallergic infants (51 boys, 39 girls). Compared with the fecal calprotectin level in the nonallergic group (median: 141 μg/g), that in the allergic group (median: 410 μg/g) was significantly higher (z = - 9.335, p < 0.001). After two dietary interventions and treatments, the fecal calprotectin levels of the infants with a milk protein allergy at the first (median: 253 μg/g) and second follow-up visits (median: 160 μg/g) were significantly lower than those before the intervention (z = - 7.884, p < 0.001 and z = - 8.239, p < 0.001, respectively). The growth index values (LAZ and WAZ) of the infants with a milk protein allergy at the first and second follow-up visits were significantly higher than those before dietary intervention (p < 0.05). Fecal calprotectin was negatively and significantly correlated with the WLZ and WAZ at the second follow-up visit (Spearman's rho = - 0.234, p = 0.01 and Spearman's rho = - 0.193, p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: The level of fecal calprotectin in infants with a milk protein allergy decreased after dietary intervention and seems to be a promising biological indicator for monitoring intestinal allergies."
