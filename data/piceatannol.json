Treatment with piceatannol increased alkaline phosphatase activity and osteogenic differentiation gene molecules (Osteocalcin and Runx2), but this was attenuated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors (PD098059 or SB203580). Our data suggest that piceatannol promotes osteogenic differentiation of HPLFs by activating MAPKs."

      "abstract": "β-Lactamases, biofilms and toxins pose challenges for combating S. aureus infection. Thus, identifying inhibitors that can restore bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics, destroy biofilms, and antitoxins is a promising way to develop alternative agents. In this study, we found that piceatannol (pit), along with its analogues resveratrol (ret) and pterostilbene (pts) bind with β-lactamase to inhibit its activity, and 96TYR, 58ILE and 66LYS were identified as the critical binding residues. Pit and pts reduced the ampicillin (Amp) and gentamicin (Gm) MICs against S. aureus and enhanced the bactericidal ability of Amp. Pit and its analogues inhibited the formation of S. aureus USA300. In addition, the pit analogues bound with α-hemolysin and suppressed the hemolysis activity of the bacterial culture supernatant. The mechanism analysis revealed that pit exhibited multiple potential binding modes with α-hemolysin. Pit significantly decreased the cytotoxicity and the adherence effect mediated by S. aureus and increased the survival rate of Galleria mellonella that infected with S. aureus, the pathological tissue damage of Galleria mellonella was alleviated by treatment with pit alone or in combination with Amp. Taken together, our findings identify promising compounds for the development of S. aureus infection inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a very common brain disorder. This study aims to assess the neuroprotective effects of piceatannol (PCT) in preventing neuronal injury resulting from cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) in mice. Additionally, we investigated the underlying mechanisms through which PCT inhibits neuronal ferroptosis by modulating the USP14/GPX4 signaling axis. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted. In vitro, oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) was used to simulate ischemic injury in neuronal cells. We utilized various techniques, including DCFH-DA staining, FeRhoNox-1 staining, MDA and GSH determination, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, plasmid and siRNA transfection, to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of PCT and elucidate its mechanism of action. For vivo studies, we established a mouse model of I/R by ligating the bilateral common carotid arteries. The efficacy of PCT in mitigating brain injury and cognitive dysfunction were assessed through behavioral tests, histological analysis, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. PCT treatment significantly enhanced cell viability under OGD/R and reduced lipid peroxidation by decreasing levels of ROS, MDA. Furthermore, PCT effectively inhibited neuronal ferroptosis by modulating the expression of key ferroptosis-related proteins, including GPX4, ACSL4, FPN1, and Ferritin. Mechanistically, PCT was found to prevent GPX4 degradation through USP14-mediated deubiquitination. Notably, silencing USP14 reversed the ferroptotic effects of PCT, whereas overexpressing of USP14 amplified these effects. In vivo, PCT significantly reduced pathological damage of brain tissue and improved cognitive dysfunction. Piceatannol exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating ferroptosis through the USP14/GPX4 axis, thereby preventing cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.",

Natural polyphenolic compounds such as resveratrol, piceatannol, curcumin, and quercetin currently show promising results in the prevention and treatment of various cancers, due to their diverse biological activities. This review presents the effects of natural compounds on important processes related to cancer, such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and autophagy. Resveratrol, naturally found in red grapes, has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Piceatannol, a metabolite of resveratrol, shares similar anticancer properties, particularly in modulating autophagy. Curcumin, derived from turmeric, is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and its ability to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Quercetin, a flavonoid found in various fruits and vegetables, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis while enhancing the efficacy of conventional therapies. Despite their potential, challenges such as low bioavailability limit their clinical application, necessitating further research into novel delivery systems. Collectively, these compounds represent a promising avenue for enhancing gastric cancer treatment and improving patient outcomes through their multifaceted biological effects.",

      "abstract": "Natural Xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibitors represent promising therapeutic agents for hyperuricemia (HUA) treatment due to their potent efficacy and favorable safety profiles. This study involved the construction of a comprehensive database of 315 XOD inhibitors and development of 28 machine learning-based QSAR models. The ChemoPy light gradient boosting machine model exhibited the best performance (AUC = 0.9371 and MCC = 0.7423). This model identified three potential XOD inhibitors from the FooDB database: daphnetin, 7-hydroxycoumarin, and piceatannol. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed favorable interactions, with piceatannol showing a remarkable stability through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. ADME predictions suggested that all three compounds possess desirable drug-like properties and safety characteristics. Subsequent in vitro enzyme inhibition assays validated computational predictions, with piceatannol exhibiting the strongest inhibitory activity (IC50 = 8.80 ± 0.05 μM). Multispectroscopic analyses revealed that piceatannol-XOD binding was predominantly mediated by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces, which induced conformational changes characterized by decreased α-helical content and increased proportions of β-sheets, β-turns, and random coils. This study presents an efficient strategy for the identification of natural XOD inhibitors, elucidates the molecular mechanism of piceatannol-mediated XOD inhibition, and establishes a foundation for its therapeutic application in HUA treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuronal protection is a well-established method of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treatment. The pharmacodynamic effect of Piceatannol-3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (Chinese name: Hartigan, QZZG) on AIS has been reported, but the molecular mechanism of this effect remains unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to elucidate the pharmacodynamic effects and mechanisms of QZZG in the treatment of AIS. METHODS: A combined network pharmacology and metabolomics approach was used to predict the key targets and pathways of QZZG in the treatment of AIS and to elucidate the mechanism of QZZG through experimental validation. RESULTS: In this study, QZZG improved histopathologic features and reduced infarct volume and neurologic deficit scores. Integrated network pharmacology and metabolomics revealed that QZZG may protect neurons by regulating glutamate and its receptors, and that glutamate is closely related to NMDAR1, NRF2, and Caspase-3. Pathway analysis results suggested that NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ inward flow is one of the critical pathways. In terms of neuroexcitotoxicity QZZG inhibited glutamate content, reduced Ca2+ inward flow, protected mitochondrial function, and reduced ROS, as well as being able to effectively inhibit the expression of NMDAR1, Caspase-3, Bax, and promote the expression of Bcl-2, NMDAR2A. In terms of ferroptosis QZZG promoted NRF2, HO-1, GPX4 and nuclear-NRF2, inhibited the expression of BACH1 and ACSL4, and suppressed Fe2+ accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Silencing of BACH1 resulted in elevated expression of NRF2 and decreased expression of ACSL4, which inhibited the sensitivity of neurons to ferroptosis. QZZG was able to further increase NRF2 expression under conditions of silencing BACH1. QZZG induced NRF2 and inhibited BACH1, ACSL4 was inhibited by ML385, and inhibition of NRF2 induced the expression of BACH1 and ACSL4, QZZG protects neurons in an NRF2-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In summary, QZZG inhibited neuroexcitotoxicity and ferroptosis by regulating the NMDAR/NRF2/BACH1/ACSL4 pathway. The study provided a relatively novel perspective on the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment of the disease.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism of action of Piceatannol (PIC) in attenuating oxidative damage to sperm during cryopreservation. Semen samples were collected and homogenized into six equal parts for freeze-thawing experiments. Four different concentrations of PIC were utilized as cryoprotectants during the freeze-thawing process, maintaing a semen to PIC ratio of 1:1, while sperm motility after freezing and thawing was analyzed using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Sperm plasma membrane integrity was assessed via the hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) test. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activities, long with the ability to scavenge sperm malondialdehyde (MDA), were examined in sperm following the addition of PIC. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression levels of Keap1, Nrf2, GCLC, GCLM, and HMOX1 in sperm. The mechanism by which PIC protects sperm during cryopreservation from oxidative stress damage was further verified. Treatment with PIC at a dose of 5.0 μmol/L significantly improved both sperm motility and viability while effectively reducing ROS levels in frozen sperm. Additionally, the integrity of the sperm plasma membrane was significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the expression level of Keap1 was significantly reduced, whereas the expression levels of GCLC, GCLM, HMOX1, and Nrf2 were significantly increased (p < 0.05) after the addition of PIC. Notably, a significant attenuation of sperm motility and viability was observed in this treatment group when PIC treatment was accompanied by the addition of an Nrf2 inhibitor, resulting in a significant elevation of ROS levels. The finding that PIC modulates ROS in frozen sperm via the Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway thereby enhancing sperm viability levels after freezing and thawing provides a novel approach to optimize semen cryopreservation.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Lactate, a signaling molecule and energy source, crosses membranes through monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). MCT1 and MCT4 are potential cancer drug targets due to their role in metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Stilbenes, plant secondary metabolites found in several food sources, have anticancer effects, though their mechanisms of action are not well understood. This study links the anticancer activity of natural stilbenes to tumor cell lactate metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: The impact of resveratrol, pinostilbene, pterostilbene, rhapontigenin, and piceatannol on lactate transport is studied using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based lactate sensor. The viability and migration of cells expressing MCT1 or MCT4 are also evaluated. Piceatannol inhibits MCT1 effectively at low micromolar concentrations, with less effect on MCT4. All stilbenes significantly reduce cell viability and migration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that both MCTs are stilbene targets, with piceatannol highlighted as a cost-effective, low-toxicity compound for studying MCTs in cancer, providing a new mechanism of action of the therapeutic and nutraceutical effects of natural polyphenols. This enriches the understanding of dietary polyphenols in cancer prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most prevalent type of primary intraocular malignancy and is prone to metastasize, particularly to the liver. However, due to the poor understanding of the pathogenesis of UM, effective therapeutic approaches are lacking. As a phenolic compound extracted from grapes, piceatannol (PIC) exhibits anti‑cancer properties. To the best of our knowledge, however, the effects of PIC on UM have not been well investigated. Therefore, in the present study, considering the impact of pyroptosis on modulating cell viability, the mechanism underlying the effects of PIC on UM cell proliferation was explored. The inhibitory effect of PIC on proliferation of UM cells was detected by cell counting kit‑8 assay. Wound healing was used to investigate the effects of PIC on the migration of UM cells. Activity detecting assays were performed to test the apoptosis and oxidant level in UM cells. Western blotting and RT‑qPCR were used to detect the inflammatory and pyroptotic levels of UM cell after PIC treatment. PIC‑treated UM cells were screened by high‑throughput sequencing to detect the differential expression of RNA and differential genes. Si‑TREM2 transfection was used to verify the important role of TREM2 in the effects of PIC. Immunohistochemical staining was used to observe the expressions of TREM2 and GSDMR of tumor in nude mice after PIC administration. PIC effectively inhibited proliferation ability of C918 and Mum‑2b UM cell lines via enhancing apoptosis, as evidenced by enhanced activities of caspase 3 and caspase 9. In addition, treatment of UM cells with PIC attenuated cell migration in a dose‑dependent manner. PIC increased reactive oxygen species levels and suppressed the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione‑S‑transferase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase. PIC inhibited inflammatory responses in C918 cells. PIC treatment upregulated IL‑1β, IL‑18 and Nod‑like receptor protein 3 and downregulated gasdermin D (GSDMD). RNA sequencing results revealed the activation of an unconventional pyroptosis‑associated signaling pathway, namely caspase 3/GSDME signaling, following PIC treatment, which was mediated by triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) upregulation. As an agonist of TREM2, COG1410‑mediated TREM2 upregulation inhibited proliferation of C918 cells, displaying similar effects to PIC. Furthermore, PIC inhibited tumor growth via regulating the TREM2/caspase 3/GSDME pathway in a mouse model. Collectively, the present study revealed a novel mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of PIC on UM, providing a potential treatment approach for UM in clinic.",

      "abstract": "Dermal fibroblasts play a crucial role in skin structure and function by producing hyaluronic acid. Piceatannol (PIC), a polyphenol abundant in passion fruit seeds, has been reported to activate sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Clinical trials have demonstrated that PIC intake improves skin moisture and maintains skin elasticity, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of PIC on hyaluronic acid biosynthesis and the involvement of SIRT1 in this process. Human dermal fibroblast Hs68 cells were stimulated with PIC, and the expression levels of HAS2 and HYAL2, key enzymes in hyaluronic acid biosynthesis, as well as SIRT1 expression, were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, the role of SIRT1 in the hyaluronic acid biosynthesis pathway during PIC stimulation was examined using a SIRT1 inhibitor. The results demonstrated that PIC increased HAS2 expression while decreasing HYAL2 expression in human dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, PIC enhanced SIRT1 expression, and pre-treatment with a SIRT1 inhibitor mitigated PIC-induced upregulation of HAS2, suggesting that PIC promotes hyaluronic acid synthesis by inducing SIRT1. These findings suggest that PIC could serve as a beneficial food ingredient, enhancing skin structure and function by promoting hyaluronic acid biosynthesis via SIRT1 induction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is one of the most prevalent brain injuries in humans which has poor prognosis and high mortality rates. Due to several medical or surgical treatment methods, a gold standard method doesn't exist for SAH treatment. Piceatannol (PCN), a natural analog of resveratrol, was reported to reduce inflammation and apoptosis promising a wide range of therapeutic alternatives. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of PCN in an experimental SAH model. The alleviating effects of PCN in the hippocampus in an experimental SAH model were investigated for the first time. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 27 Wistar Albino male rats (200-300 g; 7-8 week) were used. Animals were divided into three groups; SHAM, SAH, and SAH + PCN. SAH model was created with 120 µl of autologous arterial tail blood to prechiasmatic cisterna. 30 mg/kg PCN was administered intraperitoneally at 1st h after SAH. Neurological evaluation was performed with Garcia's score. RT-PCR was performed for gene expression levels in the hippocampus. Pyknosis, edema, and apoptosis were evaluated by H&E and TUNEL staining. Our results indicated that PCN administration reduced apoptosis (P < 0.01), cellular edema, and pyknosis (P < 0.05) in the hippocampus after SAH. Moreover, PCN treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of TNF-α (P < 0.01), IL-6 (P < 0.05), NF-κB (P < 0.05), and Bax (P < 0.05) in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that PCN might be a potential therapeutic adjuvant agent for the treatment of early brain injury (EBI) following SAH. Further studies are required to clarify the underlying mechanisms and treatment options of SAH.",

Although reperfusion is an effective technique to rescue myocardial cell damage, it may also exacerbate myocardial cell damage. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, occurs following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Piceatannol (PCT) is a natural stilbene compound with excellent antioxidant properties that protect against I/R injury and exerts protective effects against ferroptosis-induced cardiomyocytes following I/R injury; however, the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of PCT on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: An ischemia-reperfusion model was established via ligation of the left anterior descending branch of mice's hearts and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) of cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: During ischemia-reperfusion, Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) expression was downregulated, the left ventricular function was impaired, intracellular iron and lipid peroxidation product levels were elevated, and cardiomyocytes underwent ferroptosis. Furthermore, ferroptosis was enhanced following treatment with an Nrf-2 inhibitor. After PCT treatment, Nrf-2 expression significantly increased, intracellular ferrous ions and lipid peroxidation products significantly reduced, Ferroportin1 (FPN1) expression increased, and transferrin receptor-1 (TfR-1) expression was inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: PCT regulates iron metabolism through Nrf-2 to protect against myocardial cell ferroptosis induced by myocardial I/R injury.",

Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is also a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, so we evaluated the combined anticancer efficacy of piceatannol plus low-dose shikonin, a potent and specific plant-derived PKM2 inhibitor, in two GLO I-dependent cancer cell lines, HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells and NCI-H522 human non-small-cell lung cancer cells. Combined treatment with piceatannol and low-dose shikonin for 48 h synergistically reduced cell viability, enhanced apoptosis rate, and increased extracellular methylglyoxal accumulation compared to single-agent treatment, but did not alter PKM1, PKM2, or GLO I protein expression. Taken together, these results indicate that concomitant use of low-dose shikonin potentiates piceatannol-induced apoptosis of GLO I-dependent cancer cells by augmenting methylglyoxal accumulation.",

Treatment with piceatannol (PIC) or vitamin D (Vit D) has previously exhibited mitigating impacts in pulmonary fibrosis models. The present study investigated the effects of PIC, Vit D, or a combination (PIC-Vit D) on the expression of HDAC2, HDAC4, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in the lungs; the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway; and the antioxidant status of the lungs. The objective was to determine if the treatments had protective mechanisms against pulmonary fibrosis caused by bleomycin (BLM) in rats. Adult male albino rats were given a single intratracheal dosage of BLM (10 mg/kg) to induce pulmonary fibrosis. PIC (15 mg/kg/day, oral (p.o.)), Vit D (0.5 μg/kg/day, intraperitoneal (i.p.)), or PIC-Vit D (15 mg/kg/day, p.o. plus 0.5 μg/kg/day, i.p.) were given the day following BLM instillation and maintained for 14 days. The results showed that PIC, Vit D, and PIC-Vit D significantly improved the histopathological sections; downregulated the expression of HDAC2, HDAC4, and TGF-β in the lungs; inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; decreased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition including collagen type I and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA); and increased the antioxidant capacity of the lungs by increasing the levels of glutathione (GSH) that had been reduced and decreasing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) compared with the BLM group at a p-value less than 0.05. The concomitant administration of PIC and Vit D had a synergistic impact that was greater than the impact of monotherapy with either PIC or Vit D. PIC, Vit D, and PIC-Vit D exhibited a notable protective effect through their antioxidant effects, modulation of the expression of HDAC2, HDAC4, and TGF-β in the lungs, and suppression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway."

However, the bioavailability of Piceatannol is comparatively lower than resveratrol and other stilbenes. Several approaches have been reported in recent years to enhance its bioavailability and biological activity, and clinical trials are required to validate these findings.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the magnitude of influenza pandemics as a threat to the global population, it is crucial to have as many prevention and treatment options as possible. Piceatannol (PIC) is a tetrahydroxylated stilbenoid (trans-3,4,3',5'-tetrahydroxystilbene), also known as 3'- hydroxy resveratrol, which has demonstrated many different biological activities such as anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities. PURPOSE: In this study, the anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activities and mechanisms of PIC in vitro and in vivo were investigated in order to provide reference for the development of novel plant-derived anti-IAV drugs. METHODS: The viral plaque assay, RT-PCR and western blot assay were used to evaluate the anti-IAV effects of PIC in vitro. The anti-IAV mechanism of PIC was determined by HA syncytium assay, DARTS assay and Surface Plasmon Resonance assay. The mouse pneumonia model combined with HE staining were used to study the anti-IAV effects of PIC in vivo. RESULTS: PIC shows inhibition on the multiplication of both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, and blocks the infection of H5N1 pseudovirus with low toxicity. PIC may directly act on the envelope of IAV to induce the rupture and inactivation of IAV particles. PIC can also block membrane fusion via binding to HA2 rather than HA1 and cleavage site of HA0. PIC may interact with the two residues (HA2-T68 and HA2-I75) of HA2 to block the conformational change of HA so as to inhibit membrane fusion. Importantly, oral therapy of PIC also markedly improved survival and reduced viral titers in IAV-infected mice. CONCLUSION: PIC possesses significant anti-IAV effects both in vitro and in vivo and may block IAV infection mainly through interaction with HA to block membrane fusion. Thus, PIC has the potential to be developed into a new broad-spectrum anti-influenza drug for the prevention and treatment of influenza.",

Despite advances in medical science, the treatment of colon cancer still poses a significant challenge. This study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of Adiantum pedatum (AP) extract and/or piceatannol on colon cancer induced via phenylhydrazine (PHZ) in terms of the antioxidant and apoptotic pathways and histopathologic changes in the colons of male albino rats. The rats were randomly divided into eight groups: control, AP extract, piceatannol (P), PHZ, PHZ and AP treatments, PHZ and P treatments, PHZ and both AP and P, and PHZ and prophylaxis with both AP and P. The results demonstrated that PHZ induced oxidative damage, apoptosis, and histopathological changes compared to the control group. However, the administration of AP or P or AP + P as therapy or prophylaxis significantly ameliorated these changes and upregulated the colonic mir-145 and mRNA expression of P53 and PDCD-4 while downregulating the colonic mRNA expression of PI3K, AKT, c-Myc, CK-20, SOX-2, OCT-4, and NanoG compared to the PHZ group.

      "abstract": "Currently, no drug is effective in delaying the cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's disease, which ranks as one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Hydroxylated stilbenes are active compounds that exist in fruit and herbal plants. Piceatannol (PIC) and gnetol (GNT), which have one extra hydroxyl group in comparison to resveratrol (RSV), and rhapontigenin (RHA) and isorhapontigenin (isoRHA), which were metabolized from PIC in vivo and contain the same number of hydroxyl groups as RSV, were evaluated for their effects on Alzheimer's disease-associated factors in vitro and in animal experiments. Among the five hydroxylated stilbenes, PIC was shown to be the most active in DPPH radical scavenging and in inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase and amyloid-β peptide aggregations, with concentrations for half-maximal inhibitions of 40.2, 271.74, and 0.48 μM. The different interactions of the five hydroxylated stilbenes with acetylcholinesterase or amyloid-β were obtained by molecular docking. The scopolamine-induced ICR mice fed with PIC (50 mg/kg) showed an improved learning behavior in the passive avoidance tests and had significant differences (p < 0.05) compared with those in the control group. The RHA and isoRHA at 10 μM were proven to stimulate neurite outgrowths in the SH-SY5Y cell models. These results reveal that nutraceuticals or functional foods containing PIC have the potential for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."

      "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. The only FDA-approved treatment is recanalization with systemic tissue plasminogen activators like alteplase, although reperfusion caused by recanalization can result in neuroinflammation, which can cause brain cell apoptosis. Therefore, after an ischemic/reperfusion injury, interventions are needed to minimize the neuroinflammatory cascade. In the present study, piceatannol (PCT) was studied for its neuroprotective efficacy in a rat model of global ischemic injury by attenuating c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) downstream signaling. PCT is a resveratrol analog and a polyphenolic stilbenoid naturally occurring in passion fruit and grapes. The neuroprotective efficacy of PCT (1, 5, 10 mg/kg) in ischemic conditions was assessed through pre- and post-treatment. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and tests for functional recovery were assessed. Protein and gene expression were done for JNK3 and other inflammatory markers. A docking study was performed to identify the amino acid interaction. The results showed that PCT improved motor and memory function as measured by a functional recovery test believed to be due to an increase in cerebral blood flow. Also, the caspase signaling which promotes apoptosis was found to be down-regulated; however, nitric oxide synthase expression was up-regulated, which could explain the enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF). According to our findings, PCT impeded c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) signaling by suppressing phosphorylation and disrupting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which resulted in the neuroprotective effect. Molecular docking analysis was performed to investigate the atomic-level interaction of JNK3 and PCT, which reveals that Met149, Leu206, and Lys93 amino acid residues are critical for the interaction of PCT and JNK3. According to our current research, JNK3 downstream signaling and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway are both inhibited by PCT, which results in neuroprotection under conditions of global brain ischemia. Piceatannol attenuated JNK3 phosphorylation during the ischemic condition and prevented neuronal apoptosis.",

This study aimed to investigate the cytoprotective effects of piceatannol on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced pheochromocytoma-12 (PC-12) cell damage and explore the underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicated that piceatannol pre-treatment significantly attenuated H2O2-induced PC-12 cell death. Furthermore, piceatannol effectively improved mitochondrial content and mitochondrial function, including enhancing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination capacity and increasing mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM), peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and mitochondria Complex IV expression. Meanwhile, piceatannol treatment inhibited mitochondria-mediated autophagy as demonstrated by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing autophagosome formation and light chain 3B II/I (LC3B II/I) and autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5) expression level. The protein expression level of SIRT3 was significantly increased by piceatannol in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the cytoprotective effect of piceatannol was dramatically abolished by sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) inhibitor, 3-(1H-1,2,3-Triazol-4-yl) pyridine (3-TYP), which led to an exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy in PC-12 cells under oxidative stress. In addition, the autophagy activator (rapamycin) abrogated the protective effects of piceatannol on PC-12 cell death. These findings demonstrated that piceatannol could alleviate PC-12 cell oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting autophagy via the SIRT3 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Evidence shows that the dietary intake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from food processing induces the cellular DNA damage response and leads to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, protecting from cellular DNA damage might be an effective strategy in preventing CRC. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was used as a CRC initiator in the present study. Compared with other stilbenoids, piceatannol (PIC) showed the most effective inhibition of B[a]P-induced cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) protein expression in NCM460 normal human colon epithelial cells. PIC treatment alleviated DNA migration and enhanced the expression of DNA-repair-related proteins, including histone 2AX (H2AX), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), and p53, in B[a]P-induced NCM460 cells. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that PIC exerted antioxidative effects on NCM460 cells by increasing the glutathione (GSH) content and scavenging the excess intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by B[a]P. Furthermore, PIC suppressed B[a]P-induced CYP1B1 protein expression and stimulated miR-27b-3p expression. The upregulation of phase II detoxification enzymes, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and the antioxidative enzyme, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), via the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway was observed in the PIC-treated group. Our results suggest that PIC is a potential CRC-blocking agent due to its ability to alleviate DNA damage, decrease intracellular ROS production, modulate the metabolism and detoxification of B[a]P, and activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway in B[a]P-induced NCM460 cells.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Parkinson's disease is one of the neurodegenerative diseases that have no cure. Excitotoxicity induced by excess glutamate is known to be a hallmark of these diseases. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the preventive effect of piceatannol on glutamate-induced neurodegeneration via mitochondrial rescue. METHODS AND RESULTS: The PC12 cell line and three Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) strains are employed to achieve the aim. In the in vitro study, the results show that piceatannol can prevent glutamate-induced apoptosis. Piceatannol also reduces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by activating the antioxidant system. Moreover, piceatannol can also promote mitochondrial biogenesis and induced mitochondrial fusion-related genes to preserve mitochondrial functionality. In the C. elegans model, piceatannol can prevent mitochondrial fragmentation induced by glutamate. More importantly, piceatannol effectively protects dopaminergic neurons from degradation and preserves the responses controlled by these neurons. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that piceatannol can be a more effective and potent candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, compared to resveratrol. It is capable of preventing neurodegeneration induced by excess glutamate, possibly via mitochondrial rescue. It is recommended that piceatannol be developed into a neuroprotective agent.",

      "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a common issue associated with aging. One of the typical causes of hearing loss is the damage to inner ear hair cells. In addition, oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to ARHL. To avoid excessive inflammatory responses, non-classical scorch death pathway by cell membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates of caspase-11. Piceatannol (PCT) is also known for anti-tumor, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects; however, the protective effect of piceatannol (PCT) on ARHL is unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism underlying protective effect of PCT on ARHL-induced inner ear hair cell damage. In vivo experiments showed that PCT could protect mice from inflammatory aging-induced hearing loss as well as from inner hair cells (IHC) and spiral ganglion (SG) deficits. In addition, inflammatory vesicle inhibitor BAY11-7082 ameliorated ARHL, inhibited NLRP3 and reduced GSDMD expression. In in vitro experiments we used LPS and D-gal to simulate the aging inflammatory environment. The results showed that intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, expression of Caspase-11, NLRP3, and GSDMD were significantly increased, yet treatment with PCT or BAY11-7082 significantly improved HEI-OC-1 cell injury while reducing inflammation-associated protein expression as well as the occurrence of pyroptosis. In conclusion, these results suggest a protective role for PCT against ARHL, possibly through Caspase-11-GSDMD pathway. Our findings may provide a new target and theoretical basis for hearing loss treatment using PCT.",

The purpose of the study was to assess the renoprotection of PG. METHODS: In vitro, the podocyte protection of PG was assessed in MPC-5. SD rats were injected with adriamycin to induce nephropathy in vivo. The determination of biochemical changes and inflammatory cytokines was performed, and pathological changes were examined by histopathological examination. Immunostaining and western blot analyses were used to analyse expression levels of proteins. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that PG improved adriamycin-induced podocyte injury, attenuated nephropathy, improved hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidaemia, and lowered cytokine levels. The podocyte protection of PG was further verified by reduction of desmin and increasing synaptopodin expression. Furthermore, treatment with PG down-regulated the expression of HMGB1, TLR4 and NF-κB along with its upstream regulator, IKKβ and yet up-regulated IκBα expression by western blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data showed that PG has a favourable renoprotection in experimental nephrosis, apparently by amelioration of podocyte injury. PG might mediate these effects via modulation of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway. The study first provides a promising leading compound for the treatment of NS.",

      "abstract": "Brucellosis is a contagious zoonotic disease that infects millions of people annually with hundreds of millions more being exposed. It is caused by Brucella, a highly infectious bacterial species capable of infecting humans with an estimated dose of 10-100 organisms. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been reported to contribute to prevention of viral diseases as well as a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium bovis. Here, we investigated the role of SIRT1 in the establishment of Brucella abortus infection in both in vitro and in vivo systems using the reported SIRT1 activators resveratrol (RES), piceatannol (PIC), and ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3). In RAW264.7 cells, SIRT1 activators did not alter the adherence of Brucella or Salmonella Typhimurium. However, reduced uptake of Brucella was observed in cells treated with PIC and Rg3, and survival of Brucella within the cells was only observed to decrease in cells that were treated with Rg3, while PIC treatment reduced the intracellular survival of Salmonella. SIRT1 treatment in mice via oral route resulted in augmented Brucella resistance for PIC and Rg3, but not RES. PIC treatment favors Th2 immune response despite reduced serum proinflammatory cytokine production, while Rg3-treated mice displayed high IL-12 and IFN-γ serum production. Overall, our findings encourage further investigation into the complete mechanisms of action of the different SIRT1 activators used as well as their potential benefit as an effective alternative approach against intracellular and extracellular pathogens.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are the most pressing problem in treating infectious diseases. As one of the primary drugs for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, the neurotoxicity of colistin has become a significant challenge in clinical practice. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential effect of piceatannol-3'-O-β-D glucopyranoside (PG) on colistin-induced neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: In vitro, nerve cell damage models were established by exposing N2a cells to 400 μM colistin for 24 h. The effects of PG on cell viability, apoptosis level, and oxidative stress level were analyzed. A western blot experiment was performed to determine the NRF2 pathway, apoptosis, and autophagy-related proteins. Mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected after staining using laser confocal microscopy. In vivo, nerve injury mouse model was established by intracerebroventricular colistin administration. Morphological changes in brain tissues were observed using HE and Nissl staining. RESULTS: PG significantly reduced colistin-induced neuronal apoptosis levels. The apoptosis-related protein expressions were suppressed after PG intervention. Mechanistically, PG increased the levels of antioxidant factors and decreased the levels of oxidative factors, which might be related to the activation of the NRF2 pathway. In addition, PG treatment reversed the deviations in mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential. PG suppressed autophagy levels in N2a cells, possibly because PG inhibited colistin-induced apoptosis, thus reducing the level of spontaneous protective autophagy in cells. Nrf2 knockdown N2a cell models were applied to confirm that the activation of the NRF2 pathway played a vital role in PG alleviating the nerve damage caused by colistin. CONCLUSION: PG is a potential treatment option for colistin-induced neurotoxicity. It mitigated colistin-induced oxidative stress-associated injury and mitochondrial damage by activating the NRF2/HO-1 pathway, thus reducing nerve cell apoptosis.",

Hsiao, a stout herb plant from the Polygonaceae, is a typical Tibetan folk herb with heat-clearing and detoxifying effects, but does not have the typical laxative effect compared with other rhubarb plants.

The present study endeavored to analyze the possible phytochemical constituents in R. lhasaense and explore the main compound piceatannol-3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (PG) effect on cognitive impairment and its underlying mechanism. The chemical profile of R. lhasaense discovered 46 compounds, including 27 stilbenoids and 13 gallotannins using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The UPLC determined the contents of 6 main stilbenoids, among which the content of PG was the highest, up to 61.06 mg/g. Moreover, behavioral tests showed that PG (40 mg/kg and 160 mg/kg) administration markedly ameliorated memory impairments of scopolamine-induced mice. Biochemical parameters showed that PG treatment alleviated the levels of Ach, AchE, and inflammatory factors while elevating the levels of antioxidants in mice. In addition, network pharmacology was performed to reveal PG exert an mild cognitive impairment effect by participating in neurodegenerative disease pathways, proliferation and apoptosis-, and inflammation-related pathways. Eventually, the results of molecular docking and the qRT-PCR revealed that PG down-regulated the mRNA expressions of MMP3, MMP9 and BACE1 in cognitive impairment mice brain tissue. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that PG mitigated scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice by targeting the BACE1-MMP3/9 pathway, and PG might be a promising mild AD drug candidate.",

METHODS: After the establishment of an HG-induced cell injury model and the treatment with PIC at both high and low concentrations and/or acetazolamide (ACZ, the inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase 2 [CA2]), MTT and flow cytometry assays were carried out to confirm the viability and apoptosis of HK-2 cells. The levels of oxidative stress markers lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), the ratio of glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), and the CA2 activity were determined. Both quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to calculate the expressions of CA2 (the predicted target gene of PIC via intersecting the data from bioinformatic analyses) and AKT pathway-related (phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN], phosphorylated [p]-AKT, AKT) and apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3). RESULTS: HG suppressed cell viability and the levels of GSH/GSSG ratio, CA2, pThr308-AKT/AKT, pSer473-AKT/AKT, and Bcl-2, while promoting cell apoptosis, the levels of LDH, MDA, and ROS, and the expressions of PTEN and cleaved caspase-3. All effects of HG were reversed by PIC at a high concentration. CA2 was predicted and identified as the target of PIC. In HG-treated HK-2 cells, additionally, ACZ reversed the effects of PIC on the viability, apoptosis, and levels of both oxidative stress markers and AKT pathway- and apoptosis-related factors. CONCLUSION: PIC protects against HG-induced injury of HK-2 cells via regulating CA2.",

OBJECTS: The goal of this study was to see if Piceatannol (PIC) in combination with cisplatin has a synergistic effect on N, N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)-induced HCC in rats. METHODS: Tissue antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde (MDA), and nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factors 2 (Nrf2) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) gene expression were all measured. Nuclear Factor Kabba B (NF-κB) was also tested, as well as hepatic caspase 3 and NAD (P) H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Liver specimens were subjected to histopathological analysis. RESULTS: When compared to the HCC group, piceatannol and/or cisplatin caused a significant improvement in liver function tests, as well as a significant modulation in Nrf2 gene expression and antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as a significant decrease in tissue MDA, TNF-α, NF-κB levels, NQO1 activity, and prompt and caspase-3 activities. When the PIC and/or cisplatin combination was compared to each of these compounds alone, the results were substantial. CONCLUSION: PIC in combination with cisplatin has been shown to have a synergistic anticancer impact through modulating Nrf2 and redox state. In addition, adding PIC to an HCC therapy plan that includes chemotherapeutic medicines may boost the efficacy of cisplatin while reducing its negative effects.",

      "abstract": "The effects and regulation of Beclin-1-an autophagy-related protein-have not been fully defined, however, a negative correlation has been reported between Beclin-1 expression and carcinogenesis. Meanwhile, no compound has been shown to directly inhibit its activity. Here, we evaluate piceatannol, a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, as a potential targeting agonist of Beclin-1, to assess its efficacy as an antitumor agent against gastric cancer. More specifically, we determine the effects of piceatannol treatment on cell viability using a monitoring system and colony forming assay. Piceatannol was found to efficiently inhibit the proliferation of several human gastric cancer cell lines. Autophagic flux is increased by piceatannol treatment, and correlates with inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation. Additionally, microscale thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance results show a direct interaction between piceatannol and Beclin-1, which reduces the phosphorylation activity of Beclin-1 at the Ser-295 site. Notably, piceatannol impairs the binding of Beclin-1 to Bcl-2 and enhances the recruitment of binding of UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein, which further triggers Beclin-1-dependent autophagy signaling. An increase in autophagic activity via treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, effectively sensitizes piceatannol-induced antitumor effects. Xenograft models confirmed that piceatannol inhibits tumor development and elicits a potent synergistic effect with everolimus in vivo. Taken together, the findings of this study strongly support the application of combinatorial piceatannol and everolimus therapy in future clinical trials for gastric cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piceatannol is a naturally occurring plant-derived phenolic compound (stilbenoid), an analogue of resveratrol. It has been shown that, piceatannol has biological activity properties such as antiproliferative, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic, in various human cancer studies in vitro and in vivo. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: In this study, it was aimed to investigate whether piceatannol induces apoptosis through anticancer activity methods (cell viability, colony formation, annexin-V/7-AAD, ROS (Reactive oxygen species), MMP (Mitochondrial membrane potential), wound healing, invasion assay, RT-qPCR (Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction), western blotting in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines. RESULTS: According to our results, piceatannol decreased cell viability in a dose and time-dependent manner [the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 60 µM in PANC-1 and IC50: 90 µM in MIA PaCa-2 cell line at 48 h (h)] and caused significant changes in the expression of apoptosis-related genes and protein. Piceatannol induced apoptosis in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, accompanied by increased ROS production, decreased MMP, and increased Caspase-3-9 activity. Piceatannol also inhibited colony-forming abilities, invasion, and migration of PC cells. CONCLUSION: Our results show that piceatannol has an anti-cancerogenic effect on PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, and exerts this effect by suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Therefore, piceatannol could be considered to be a potential chemotherapeutic agent candidate for the treatment and prevention of PC.",

      "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan that infects the nucleated cells of warm-blooded animals and causes life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients. Due to the limited effectiveness and prominent side effects of existing drugs, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic options against T. gondii. Piceatannol is a natural plant compound with multiple functions such as antibacterial, antileukemic and antiparasitic activities. In the present study, the anti-T. gondii activity of piceatannol was evaluated. Piceatannol potently inhibited Toxoplasma with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 28.10 μM. Piceatannol showed a significant inhibitory effect on intracellular proliferation, inhibiting intracellular parasites at a rate of 98.9% when treatment with 100 μM piceatannol. However, the invasion ability of tachyzoites was not affected by piceatannol. By immunofluorescence assay, we noted that the parasite showed abnormalities in cell division after exposure to piceatannol. To determine the in vivo effect of piceatannol on acute infection, a model was established by infecting BALB/c mice with the virulent RH strain of T. gondii. Mice infected with 500 tachyzoites showed a significant therapeutic effect when treated with 15 mg/kg of piceatannol. These results suggest that piceatannol is a promising drug for the treatment of T. gondii."

      "abstract": "Immunogenic cell death (ICD) promotes the immune antitumor response via releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying tumor cells. The induction of autophagy improves the efficacy of multiple immunogenic chemotherapies. Here, we show that piceatannol, a dietary phenolic compound that is widely distributed in multiple fruits and vegetables such as grapes, blueberries, and mushrooms, induces autophagy and enhances oxaliplatin (OXA)-induced anticancer immune response. Specifically, piceatannol enhanced OXA-induced release of DAMPs, several key hallmarks of ICD including ATP release, cell surface exposure of calreticulin, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release. Mechanistically, piceatannol promoted autophagy via activating TFEB/TFE3, two key transcription factors of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, and inhibiting autophagy attenuated piceatannol plus OXA-induced ATP release. Furthermore, piceatannol induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, which is critical for its role in enhancing OXA-induced cell surface exposure of calreticulin, another key hallmark of ICD. Consistently, the combination of piceatannol with OXA promoted the anticancer effects in immunocompetent mice. Taken together, our results indicate the importance and great potential of dietary piceatannol in cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, piceatannol may be used as an ICD enhancer that improves the efficacy of chemotherapeutics such as OXA in cancer treatment with minimized toxicity.",

Piceatannol, a dietary polyphenol, possesses vital pharmacological effects in metabolic disorders, cancers, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease; however, its role in PF is still not completely elucidated. Mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were administered bleomycin (BLM) intratracheally (2 U/kg) to establish an in vivo PF model. Murine primary lung fibroblasts were isolated and stimulated with TGF-β (10 ng/mL) for 48 h to induce its activation. Meanwhile, mice or primary lung fibroblasts were treated with different doses of piceatannol to observe its protective roles. Pulmonary function and arterial blood gas were detected to assess pulmonary physiological status. Collagen deposition and the mRNA levels of profibrotic genes were determined by H&E staining and RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the protein and mRNA markers, as well as end-product of oxidative stress were detected in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that pulmonary function was significantly impaired in BLM-induced mice, accompanied by elevated oxidative stress and excessive collagen synthesis. Piceatannol significantly improved pulmonary function and decreased oxidative injury as well as collagen synthesis in mice with PF. Mechanically, piceatannol treatment significantly inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in BLM-induced mice and TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts. Additional findings also demonstrated that coumermycin A1 (C-A1), an agonist of JAK2, could abolish the effects of piceatannol on TGF-β-induced lung fibroblasts and reactivated the phosphorylation STAT3. Taken together, our study demonstrated that piceatannol could protect against oxidative injury and collagen synthesis during PF in a JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway-dependent manner.",

Piceatannol-3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside for injection (PGI) is mainly used for the prevention and treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. With the spread of cerebrovascular disease, the possibility of combining the two drugs has increased; however, there is no research on the drug-drug interaction (DDI) between these two medicines. In this paper, an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap MS) method was established to characterize the chemical constituents of GAO first; 62 compounds were identified or tentatively identified based on their retention time (RT), MS, and MS/MS data. Nine main compounds were determined by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QQQ-MS). Furthermore, incubation with liver microsomes in vitro was fulfilled; the results showed that GAO had a significant inhibitory effect on UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 (p < 0.05), and PGI was mainly metabolized by UGT1A9. The identification results of in vivo metabolites of PGI showed that PGI mainly undergoes a phase II binding reaction mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulfotransferase (SULT) in vivo. Therefore, pharmacokinetic studies were performed to investigate the DDI between GAO and PGI. The results showed that the AUC (p < 0.05) and T1/2 (p < 0.05) of PGI in vivo were significantly increased when administered together with GAO, whereas the CL was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The exploration of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that there was a DDI between GAO and PGI."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of piceatannol (PIC) on selenite-induced cataracts in Sprague-Dawley rats and explore its therapeutic effects as an antioxidant. METHODS: Thirty-two eight-day-old rat pups were randomly divided into four groups, with eight pups in each of them. Group 1, as the control group, was injected with the same amount of saline, while Groups 2-4 were administered with sodium selenite (3.46 mg/kg) subcutaneously into the neck on postpartum day 10 for cataract induction. Without further treatment, Group 2 served as the control model, while Groups 3 and 4 (low- and high-dose PIC-treated) had intraperitoneal piceatannol from day 8 to day 17 at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively. On postpartum day 17, after the last injection, the rat pups were examined for cataract grade by slit lamp, and the lenses of every group were isolated for oxidative damage indicators and further analysis. SRA01/04 cells were exposed to 600 μM H2O2 for 24 hours with or without pretreatment with 10μМ piceatannol. Cell viability was tested by CCK-8 assay and cell apoptosis was evaluated by AnnexinV-PE/7AAD assay. RESULTS: This study determined that compared with the model group, the degree of lens opacity was significantly reduced in PIC-treated groups. The histopathological damage of the lenses in the PIC-treated groups improved compared to the model group. There were fewer signs of lesions, such as vacuoles and atrophy. The biochemical results indicated that malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the PIC-treated groups were downregulated and the antioxidant enzyme activities (GSH and catalase) and antioxidant status (SOD) were upregulated compared with the model group. In vitro, piceatannol significantly restored cell viability and cell apoptosis under H2O2 injury. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with piceatannol may achieve a protective effect on cataract development through upregulating antioxidant enzyme activity.",

      "abstract": "Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by myofibroblast accumulation and extracellular matrix deposition, which lead to irreversible damage of the lung's architecture and the formation of fibrotic lesions. IPF is also a sequela in serious patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The molecular mechanisms under pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear, and there is no satisfactory treatment currently available. Piceatannol (PIC) is a naturally occurring resveratrol analog found in a variety of dietary sources such as grapes, passion fruit, and white tea. It has been reported to inhibit liver fibroblast growth and exhibited various antitumor activities, although its role in pulmonary fibrosis has not been established yet. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-fibrotic role of PIC in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Methods: Mice with BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis were treated with PIC, and fibrotic changes were measured by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and hydroxyproline assay. Luciferase assay, Western blot assay, histological analysis, and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate the effect of PIC on fibroblast activation and autophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH-3T3) and human lung fibroblast cells (HFL1). The anti-fibrotic mechanisms of PIC were either confirmed in vivo. Results: Our results showed that PIC significantly alleviated the bleomycin-induced collagen deposition and myofibroblast accumulation. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that PIC plays a role in activating autophagy in the process of anti-fibroblast activation. Further mechanism studies demonstrated that PIC can promote autophagy via inhibiting the TGF-β1-Smad3/ERK/P38 signaling pathway, which leads to a decreased number of activated myofibroblasts. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated for the first time that PIC possesses the protective effects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis due to the direct pulmonary protective effects which enhance the effect of autophagy in vitro and in vivo and finally leads to the decreased number of activated myofibroblasts. PIC may serve as a candidate compound for pulmonary fibrosis therapy and attenuates the sequelae of SARS-COV-2 pulmonary fibrosis."

In patients with some salivary gland function remaining, pharmaceutical treatments are not recommended; therefore, new, more effective methods of promoting saliva production are needed. Hence, this study aimed to provide an overview of the histological changes in the salivary gland in the model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced degenerative changes in male Wistar rats and to evaluate the protective effect of piceatannol. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: the control group, the ISO group, and the piceatannol (PIC)-1, and -2 groups. After the third day of the experiment, Iso (0.8 mg/100 g) was injected intraperitoneally (IP) twice daily into the animals. PIC was given IP in different daily doses (20 and 40 mg/kg) for three days before ISO and seven days with ISO injection. The salivary glands were rapidly dissected and processed for histological, histochemical, immunohistochemical (Ki-67), and morphometric analysis. Upon seven days of treatment with ISO, marked hypertrophy was observed, along with an increased number of positive Ki-67 cells. Proliferation was increased in some endothelial cells as well as in ducts themselves. Despite the significant decrease in proliferation activity, the control group did not return to the usual activity level after treatment with low-dose PIC. Treatment with a high dose of PIC reduced proliferative activity to the point where it was substantially identical to the results seen in the control group. An ISO-driven xerostomia model showed a novel protective effect of piceatannol. A new era of regenerative medicine is dawning around PIC's promising role."

Preventing adipose loss is considered a key target in the early stages of cachexia. Lipolysis is considered the central driver of adipose loss in CAC. We recently found that piceatannol, but not its analogue resveratrol, exhibits an inhibitory effect on lipolysis. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of piceatannol in cancer-associated lipolysis and cachexia-induced weight loss. Cancer cell-induced lipolysis in adipocytes was stimulated using cancer-conditioned media (CCM) or co-culture with human pancreatic cancer cells and the cachexia-associated cytokines TNF-α and interleukin-6 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. C26 colon carcinoma-bearing mice were modeled using CAC in vivo. Piceatannol reduced cancer-associated lipolysis by at least 50% in both CCM and cytokine-induced lipolysis in vitro. Further gene and protein analysis confirmed that piceatannol modulated the stability of lipolytic proteins. Moreover, piceatannol protected tumor-bearing mice against weight-loss in early stages of CAC largely through preserving adipose tissue, with no effect on survival. This study demonstrates the use of a dietary compound to preserve adipose in models of early stage CAC and provides groundwork for further investigation of piceatannol or piceatannol-rich foods as alternative medicine in the preservation of body fat mass and future CAC therapy.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: M2 phenotype tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) play a key role in distant metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. Herein, a specific molecular mechanism that contributes to malignant progression is illuminated and investigates whether piceatannol (PIC) can target the crosstalk between M2-TAMs and cancer cells for potential colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: To mimic the tumor microenvironment (TME), direct and indirect coculture systems in vitro and in vivo mouse xenograft models are established. The results demonstrate that post-treatment with PIC in TME more effectively prevented the aggressive features and stemness of SW480 cells by restricting the polarization of M2-like macrophages and blocking the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) positive feedback autocrine/paracrine loop that exists between M2-like polarized macrophages and cancer cells. Furthermore, xenograft assays also observe significant repression in tumor growth and lung metastases with the administration of PIC. The key mechanism underlying the antimetastasis effects of PIC may include its directly inhibitory activity against TGF-β receptor type-1 (TGF-βR1) in the M2-like TAMs-created TME. CONCLUSION: These novel findings demonstrate that PIC is a potent TGF-β1/TGF-βR1 pathway inhibitor and TME modulator for preventing tumor progression and metastasis in CRC by reeducating TAMs.",

      "abstract": "One of the major aggressive factors that affect gastric injury is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Indomethacin (Indo) showed higher potentiality in gastric injury over conventional NSAIDs. Piceatannol (PIC) is a natural polyphenolic stilbene that possesses potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The gastroprotective properties of PIC have been overlooked previously. Hence, we aim to study gastric injury induced by Indo and the protective action manifested by PIC, as well as to elucidate the likely underlying mechanisms of action in a rat model. The rats have been treated with vehicle, Indo alone, combined treatment with Indo, and PIC at (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg), respectively. The rats were also treated with Indo and omeprazole. In our study, we found that PIC at both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses was effective by averting the rise in ulcer and lesion indices, acid production, and histological variations persuaded by Indo. Mechanistically, PIC significantly reduced lipid peroxidation product (MDA), increased the GSH content, and enhanced SOD and CAT activity. In addition, PIC exhibits a distinct reduction in the levels of inflammatory parameters (Cox-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and NFκB). Contrastingly, PIC augmented both mucin and PGE2 content. Moreover, PIC fostered angiogenesis by increasing the expression of proangiogenic factors (VEGF, bFGF, and PDGF). Overall, the above results suggest PIC exhibits a potential protective effect against Indo-induced gastric ulcers by the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic mechanisms."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly targets the synovial membrane, thus causing stiffness, deformity and dysfunction of joints. To date, no effective anti‑inflammatory treatments are available for RA. Piceatannol (PIC) is a natural derivative of resveratrol, which has been reported to attenuate the inflammatory response. To evaluate the effect of PIC on RA and to determine the underlying molecular target of PIC, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed in the present study. A CIA rat model was established to evaluate the therapeutic effects of PIC. TNF‑α, IL‑1β and IL‑6 levels in blood were measured by ELISA. Western blotting, immunofluorescence analysis and reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) were used to analyze the expression levels of protein and mRNA. In vitro, RA‑fibroblast‑like synoviocytes (FLSs) were pretreated with PIC and subsequently stimulated with TNF‑α. The results revealed that PIC significantly upregulated the expression levels of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax and cleaved caspase‑3. PIC also significantly reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including PGE2, IL‑6 and IL‑1β, and significantly downregulated the expression of cyclooxygenase‑2 at both the mRNA and protein expression levels. Furthermore, PIC downregulated the expression of MMP‑3 and MMP‑13, which have been found to be highly expressed in the synovium of patients with RA. Mechanistically, PIC was capable of significantly downregulating the expression levels of proteins involved in the NF‑κB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results of the in vivo experiments using a rat collagen‑induced arthritis model demonstrated that PIC decreased the arthritis score and exerted beneficial effects in cartilage and significantly reduced the expression of MMP‑13. In conclusion, the findings of the present study revealed that PIC could suppress the inflammatory response, promote apoptosis, and exert a significant regulatory effect on the NF‑κB and MAPK signaling pathways in RA‑FLSs. Therefore, PIC may represent a potential drug for the future treatment of RA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piceatannol is a resveratrol metabolite commonly found in red wine, grapes. Several studies have investigated the immune-modulating effects of piceatannol on processes related to allergic reactions. However, the relationship between piceatannol and atopic dermatitis (AD) has not yet been reported. This study sought to investigate the effects of piceatannol in animal and cell line models. METHODS: AD-like symptoms and skin lesions were triggered by repeated topical treatment of Dermatophagoides farinae extract (DFE) on the skin of NC/Nga mice. The molecular mechanism of piceatannol was studied in the TNFα/IFNγ-induced HaCaT cell line. RESULTS: Piceatannol attenuated DFE-induced AD-like symptoms, as shown by skin thickness, dermatitis score, scratching time, and skin water loss. Histopathological analysis showed that piceatannol suppressed DFE-induced immune cell infiltration into the skin. These results occurred concomitantly with the downregulation of inflammatory markers, including serum and skin TARC and MDC. Piceatannol decreased phosphorylation of JAK-STAT protein in the TNFα/IFNγ-induced HaCaT cell line. A molecular docking study showed that piceatannol strongly interacts with JAK1, suggesting a possible mode of action. CONCLUSION: The study results showed that piceatannol, a metabolite of resveratrol, attenuates atopic dermatitis and provide important implication of development of piceatannol as functional ingredients or therapeutic agents."

      "abstract": "Vascular barrier dysfunction is considered as the initial and critical event in atherosclerosis progression. Recent studies have revealed that treatment with piceatannol (PIC) alleviates both acute and chronic responses to vascular injury. We investigated whether PIC treatment would have beneficial effects on glucolipotoxicity-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. Target proteins of PIC were identified from several online databases. Then, we confirmed the effect of PIC on endothelial barrier function. PIC treatment mitigated the impairment of endothelial cell motility, adhesion and migration ability associated with high glucose/lipid stimulation. PIC stabilized cytoskeletal reorganization and expression of cell cytoskeletal associated proteins GTPase. PIC reversed changes in critical vascular junction proteins and thus preserved endothelial barrier function and permeability. Finally, we confirmed that reducing of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/p65 activation and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in the protective effect of PIC against glucolipotoxicity-induced vascular barrier injury. We identify PIC as a promising therapeutic strategy for glucolipotoxicity-induced endothelial barrier injury."

      "abstract": "Piceatannol (3,5,3',4'-trans-tetrahydroxystilbene) is a natural analog and a metabolite of resveratrol present in grapes and red wine. Previous studies have reported that piceatannol exerts a broad spectrum of health benefits including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chemopreventive, and neuroprotective effects. However, little is known about the hepatoprotective effect of piceatannol against toxin-induced liver fibrosis. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the protective effect of piceatannol in a mouse model of CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis. Oral administration of piceatannol significantly improved the hepatic functions of CCl4-treated mice in both therapeutic and preventive models. Additionally, the immunohistochemical staining results revealed that collagen deposition in CCl4-injected mice was significantly reduced by treatment with piceatannol. Moreover, piceatannol remarkably suppressed the expressions of collagen I, α-smooth muscle protein (α-SMA), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) induced by CCl4. The anti-fibrotic mechanism of piceatannol was associated with the regulation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling pathway. Finally, piceatannol also profoundly alleviated CCl4-induced hepatic oxidative damage by elevating the level of glutathione and catalase activity. Altogether, our current findings suggest that piceatannol may serve as a bioactive agent that inhibits or alleviates toxic-induced fibroproliferative diseases, especially in the prevention of liver fibrosis.",

Despite recent advances in the treatment of this disease, the prognosis and overall long-term survival for patients remain poor, which drives the search for new chemotherapeutics and treatment strategies. Piceatannol, a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and wine, appears to be a promising chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia. The aim of the present study was to examine whether piceatannol induces autophagy and/or apoptosis in HL-60 human acute myeloid leukemia cells and whether HL-60 cells are able to acquire resistance to piceatannol toxicity. We found that piceatannol at the IC90 concentration of 14 µM did not induce autophagy in HL-60 cells. However, it induced caspase-dependent apoptosis characterized by phosphatidylserine externalization, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, PARP1 cleavage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of cell nuclei. Our findings also imply that HL-60 cells are able to acquire resistance to piceatannol toxicity via mechanisms related to MRP1 activity. Our results suggest that the use of piceatannol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent may be associated with the risk of multidrug resistance, warranting its use in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.",

This study investigated the possible protective effect of piceatannol (PIC) in a model of cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats. PIC (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was given for 7 days, starting 2 days before cisplatin single injection (7 mg/kg, i.p.). Behavioural, biochemical and histological examinations were conducted. Cisplatin administration resulted in thermal hypoalgesia evidenced by increased paw and tail withdrawal latency times in the hotplate and tail flick tests, respectively, and reduced the abdominal constrictions in response to the acetic acid injection. Moreover, cisplatin treatment decreased rat locomotor activity and grip strength. These behavioural alterations were reversed by PIC coadministration. In addition, PIC decreased cisplatin-induced elevation in serum neurotensin and platinum accumulation in sciatic nerve. Also, PIC reversed, to a large extent, cisplatin-induced microscopical alterations in nerve axons and restored normal myelin thickness. Therefore, PIC may protect against cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) represents one of the serious complications secondary to sepsis, which is a leading cause of the high mortality rate among septic cases. Subsequent cardiomyocyte apoptosis, together with the uncontrolled inflammatory response, has been suggested to be closely related to SIMD. Piceatannol (PIC) is verified with potent anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects, but its function and molecular mechanism in SIMD remain unknown so far. This study aimed to explore the potential role and mechanism of action of PIC in resisting SIMD. The interaction of PIC with JAK2 proteins was evaluated by molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). The cecal ligation and puncture-induced septicemia mice and the LPS-stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes were prepared as the models in vivo and in vitro, separately. Molecular docking showed that JAK2-PIC complex had the -8.279 kcal/mol binding energy. MD simulations showed that JAK2-PIC binding was stable. SPRi analysis also showed that PIC has a strong binding affinity to JAK2. PIC treatment significantly ameliorated the cardiac function, attenuated the sepsis-induced myocardial loss, and suppressed the myocardial inflammatory responses both in vivo and in vitro. Further detection revealed that PIC inhibited the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling, which was tightly associated with apoptosis and inflammation. Importantly, pre-incubation with a JAK2 inhibitor (AG490) partially blocked the cardioprotective effects of PIC. Collectively, the findings demonstrated that PIC restored the impaired cardiac function by attenuating the sepsis-induced apoptosis and inflammation via suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 pathway both in septic mice and H9C2 cardiomyocytes.",

This study aims to investigate the cytoprotective effects of piceatannol on ROS-mediated PC-12 cells damage and related mitochondrial dysfunction. Piceatannol treatment could significantly attenuate PC-12 cells oxidative damage and ROS-mediated cells apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment with piceatannol effectively decreased mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cleaved-caspase 3, and increased Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax compared with control H2 O2 group. Meanwhile, piceatannol treatment improved mitochondrial respiration function which led to an enhancement in the maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity. Further mechanisms analysis showed that the protein expression of SIRT3 and its downstream protein FOXO3a were significantly increased after piceatannol addition in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas the cytoprotective role of piceatannol was markedly abolished by the SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP, suggesting that SIRT3/FOXO3a signaling pathway played a vital role in mediating the neuronal cytoprotective effects of piceatannol.

This study was performed to explore the role of Piceatannol (PIC) in the process of \"mitochondrial biogenesis\" signaling pathway as possible management of disturbances induced in stressed animal model(s) either by gamma-irradiation (IR) or administration of reserpine (RES); as a mitochondrial complex-I inhibitor. PIC (10 mg/kg BW/day; orally) were given to rats for 7 days, after exposure to an acute dose of γ-radiation (6 Gy), or after a single reserpine injection (1 g/kg BW; sc). Compared to reserpine or γ-radiation, PIC has attenuated hepatic and renal mitochondrial oxidative stress denoted by the significant reduction in the content of lipid peroxides and NO with significant induction of SOD, CAT, GSH-PX, and GR activities. PIC has also significantly alleviated the increase of the inflammatory markers, TNF-α and IL-6 and apoptotic markers, cytochrome c, and caspase-3. The decrease of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptotic responses were linked to a significant amelioration in mitochondrial biogenesis demonstrated by the increased expression and proteins' tissue contents of SIRT1/p38-AMPK, PGC-1α signaling pathway. The results are substantiated by the significant amelioration in mitochondrial function verified by the higher levels of ATP content, and complex I activity, besides the improvement of hepatic and renal functions. Additionally, histopathological examinations of hepatic and renal tissues showed that PIC has modulated tissue architecture after reserpine or gamma-radiation-induced tissue damage. Piceatannol improves mitochondrial functions by regulating the oxidant/antioxidant disequilibrium, the inflammatory and apoptotic responses, suggesting its possible use as adjuvant therapy in radio-therapeutic protocols to attenuate hepatic and renal injuries.",

Treatment with resveratrol and piceatannol significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in vASCs. Their effective concentrations were 5, 10, and 20 μM for inhibiting adipogenesis of vASCs. Interestingly, despite the similar chemical structures of the two compounds, piceatannol showed a higher anti-adipogenic effect at 20 μM than resveratrol in vASCs. Moreover, the inhibitory capacity of lipid droplet generation was higher for piceatannol at 20 μM than that of resveratrol. Piceatannol significantly attenuated the expression level of adipogenic markers (e.g., CCAAT/enhanced binding protein α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2)) compared to resveratrol at the mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that piceatannol is a superior anti-adipogenic compound compared to resveratrol in the vASC model of visceral obesity."

      "abstract": "Reperfusion is a critical therapeutic intervention used following acute ischemic stroke; however, it may cause cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) and aggravate brain damage. Piceatannol (Pic), a hydroxylated analog of resveratrol, has been reported to exhibit anti‑inflammatory effects. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms and its effects on CIRI have not been sufficiently assessed, and, to the best of our knowledge, current methods of prevention of CIRI are limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Pic on improving neurological function in a mouse model of CIRI. For the animal experiments, 8‑week‑old C57BL/6 mice were raised and randomly grouped, and an in vivo model of CIRI was established. Mice were administered a low (10 mg/kg/day) or high‑dose (20 mg/kg/d) of Pic 1 h after CIRI orally and once daily for the next 6 days. Neurological dysfunction was assessed using a modified neurological severity score and a rotarod test 1 week after CIRI establishment, and the cognitive status of the mice was assessed using a Morris water maze. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to evaluate the histopathological changes. The expression levels of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), FoxO1, cleaved caspase‑3 (CC‑3), Bax and Bcl‑2 were measured using western blotting. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase, glutathione (GSH) peroxidase and catalase] and non‑enzymatic antioxidants (GSH) were also detected using spectrophotometry. After inhibition of the Sirt1/FoxO1 pathway, a TUNEL assay was used for the detection of apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo. The co‑localization of neuron‑specific nuclear protein and CC‑3 was assessing using immunofluorescent staining. Pic improved neurological functions and ameliorated hippocampal neuronal pathology following CIRI. In addition, the expression levels of CC‑3 and Bax and intracellular ROS levels were increased, while levels of antioxidant and non‑enzymatic enzymes were decreased in the mouse model of CIRI. Low and high doses of Pic significantly decreased ROS production and the expression levels of apoptosis‑related proteins, but increased antioxidant enzyme levels. However, a high‑dose of Pic did not result in increased levels of non‑enzymatic enzymes. Furthermore, low and high doses of Pic treatment significantly activated the Sirt1/FoxO1 pathway. Following inhibition of the Sirt1/FoxO1 pathway, the percentage of TUNEL‑positive cells and expression of CC‑3 were increased, and CC‑3 was enriched in neurons. The antioxidant effects of Pic were blocked by inhibition of Sirt1 in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, these results suggested that Pic may exert a neuroprotective effect against in hippocampal neurons via the Sirt1/FoxO1 pathway.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of piceatannol (PT) in statin (rosuvastatin and simvastatin) resistance and tolerance and its association with PCSK9 expression via its p300 inhibitory (p300i) activity. An in vitro study was performed using HepG2 cells that were exposed to statins (rosuvastatin or simvastatin) with or without PT in delipidated serum (DLPS) medium. In the statin exposed conditions, PCSK9 expression was reduced following PT treatment when compared to HepG2 cells w/o PT treatment. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the expression of the transcription factors SREBP2 and HNF1α, which regulate PCSK9 expression. This resulted in low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) stabilization and reduced cellular cholesterol levels. This indicates that PT epigenetically controls statin-induced PCSK9 expression. Interestingly, PT attenuated p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Moreover, simulation of PT-p300 binding suggested that PT inhibits p300 as PT could be docked in the p300 HAT domain. Furthermore, inhibition of p300 HAT activity using C-646, a selective p300 inhibitor, or through an siRNA system effectively reduced PCSK9 induction upon statin exposure in HepG2 cells. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that PT blocked the recruitment of p300 to the PCSK9 promoter region. In summary, PT attenuated statin-induced PCSK9 expression by inhibiting p300 HAT activity. Finally, co-administration of simvastatin and PT for 10 weeks further reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and stabilized the hepatic LDLR protein level compared with those resulting from single treatment of simvastatin in a high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia mouse model. Our findings indicate that PT is a new nutraceutical candidate to reduce the statin resistance and tolerance that occurs in patients with hypercholesterolemia.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which affects over 20% of the adult population, is the most common liver disease worldwide and can progress to inflammatory hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. The need to alleviate NAFLD is imperative, but there are limited pharmacological therapies available. Based on previous reports that piceatannol, a stilbenoid metabolite of resveratrol, exhibits anti-obesity, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, the goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of piceatannol on prevention and/or treatment of NAFLD. The results showed that piceatannol significantly decreased fat accumulation and suppressed lipogenesis and fatty acids (FAs) uptake by decreasing sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) in steatosis-induced HepG2 hepatocytes. Piceatannol treatment also promoted FAs β-oxidation by increasing farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α) under steatosis conditions. Moreover, piceatannol significantly suppressed FA-induced oxidative stress and inhibited phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). Overall, it is suggested that piceatannol reduced fat accumulation in steatosis-induced HepG2 cells by suppressing lipogenesis (SREBP1 and ACC) and FA uptake (CD36), and promoting FAs oxidation (FXR, PPARα and CPT1α)."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of Pice in osteosarcoma (OS) cells remain unclear. Thus, we hypothesized that Pice exerts anticancer effects on OS cells via the regulation of miRNA expression. Herein, we performed a MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis to determine cell viability and apoptosis in OS cells treated with Pice, respectively. Our results showed that Pice inhibits proliferation in a dose‑dependent manner induces the apoptosis of OS cells. More importantly, miRNA microarray analysis identified that Pice alters miRNA expression profiles in human OS cells after treatment with Pice, and miR‑21 was the most significantly downregulated. In addition, the therapeutic effects of Pice on OS cells were weakened by restoration of miR‑21. In addition, we further verified that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumor suppressor gene, is the functional target of miR‑21 and Pice blocks the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway through inhibiting miR‑21 expression in OS cells. Our findings suggested that Pice may exert anticancer effects on OS cells via mediating the miR‑21/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway and could be considered to be a potential anticancer agent for treating OS.",

      "abstract": "As a major bioactive compound from grapes, piceatannol (PIC) has been reported to exert anti-atherosclerotic activity in various studies. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the effect of piceatannol against atherosclerosis (AS) is elusive. Our study identified miR-200a/Nrf2/GSDMD signaling pathway as critical mediators in the effect of piceatannol on macrophages. In the present study, we confirmed that treatment of piceatannol repressed the oxLDL-induced lipid storage in macrophages. Compared with control group, piceatannol inhibited TG storage and the activity of caspase1. It is noting that in response to oxLDL challenge, piceatannol abated the pyroptosis in RAW264.7 cells, with a decreased expression of caspase1, gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-18, IL-1β and NLRP3. Moreover, we investigated the role of microRNA (miR)-200a/Nrf2 signaling pathway in the effect of piceatannol. The results declared that after transfection of si-miR-200a or si-Nrf2 plasmids, the effects of piceatannol on macrophages were converted, including lipid storage and pyroptosis. Importantly, si-miR-200a plasmid reduced the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), indicating that miR-200a acted as an enhancer of Nrf2 in macrophages. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that piceatannol exerts anti-atherosclerotic activity on RAW264.7 cells by regulating miR-200a/Nrf2/GSDMD signaling. The present study is the first time to identify miR-200a as a candidate target in AS and declared an association between miR-200a and pyroptosis, which provides a novel therapy for the treatment of AS.",

Human infants or piglets are prone to oxidative damage due to their uncompleted development of the antioxidant system, causing liver disease. Piceatannol (PIC) has been found to have significant antioxidant effects. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of PIC on the liver in piglets experiencing oxidative stress caused by diquat (DQ). After weaning, 54 male piglets (Duroc × [Landrace × Yorkshire]) were selected and randomly divided into three treatment groups: the CON group, the DQ-CON group, and the DQ-PIC group. The two challenged groups were injected with DQ and then orally administrated either PIC or another vehicle solution, while the control group was given sterile saline injections and an orally administrated vehicle solution. Compared to the results of the CON group, DQ increased the percentage of apoptosis cells in the liver, also decreased the amount of reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, activities of mitochondrial complex I, II, III, and V, and the protein expression level of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) were inhibited by DQ. Furthermore, PIC supplementation inhibited the apoptosis of hepatic cells caused by DQ. PIC also decreased MDA levels and increased the amount of GSH. Piglets given PIC supplementation exhibited increased activities of mitochondrial complex I, II, III, and V, the protein expression level of SIRT1, and the ATP production in the liver. In conclusion, PIC affected the liver of piglets by improving redox status, preserving mitochondrial function, and preventing excessive apoptosis."

The PC-3, 22Rv1, LNCaP, and VCaP prostate cancer cells were exposed to PIC (10-40 μM), and cell viability, lactate measurement, Western blot, and flow cytometric analyses were performed. For an in vivo experiments, eight-week-old TRAMP mice (n = 10 per group each) received an aqueous extract of PFE containing 20 mg of PIC/kg or water (control group) by gavage for 4 or 10 weeks for further analyses. PIC treatment concentration- and time-dependently reduced viability of all cell lines tested. 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells treated with PIC did not exhibit any significant alteration in the intracellular accumulation of lactate. PIC treatment caused G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. PIC-treated cells exhibited altered protein levels of p53, p21, cyclin D1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4). The short and long-term PFE treatments also affected p21, cyclin D1 and cdk4 and delayed disease progression in TRAMP, with a decreased incidence of preneoplastic lesions. In conclusion, PIC apparently does not alter glucose metabolism in prostate cancer cells, while cell cycle arrest and p53 modulation are likely important in anti-cancer effects of PIC alone or as a food matrix byproduct in prostate cancer cells, especially those with an androgen-dependent phenotype."

      "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus, which results in the establishment of a latent infection that persists throughout the life of the host and can be reactivated when the immunity is low. Currently, there is no vaccine for hCMV infection, and the licensed antiviral drugs mainly target the viral enzymes and have obvious adverse reactions. Thus, it is important to search for compounds with anti-hCMV properties. The present study aimed to investigate the suppressive effects of piceatannol on hCMV Towne strain infection and the putative underlying mechanisms using human diploid fibroblast WI-38 cells. Piceatannol supplementation prevented the lytic changes induced by hCMV infection in WI-38 cells. Furthermore, piceatannol suppressed the expression of hCMV immediate-early (IE) and early (E) proteins as well as the replication of hCMV DNA in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, hCMV-induced cellular senescence was suppressed by piceatannol, as shown by a decline in the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity and decreased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). p16INK4a, a major senescence-associated molecule, was dramatically elevated by current hCMV infection that was attenuated by pre-incubation with piceatannol in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that piceatannol suppressed the hCMV infection via inhibition of the activation of p16INK4a and cellular senescence induced by hCMV. Together, these findings indicate piceatannol as a novel and potent anti-hCMV agent with the potential to be developed as an effective treatment for chronic hCMV infection.",

This study investigated the function of PIC in osteosarcoma, aiming to provide a research basis for osteosarcoma therapy. METHODS: Human osteosarcoma cells in this study were, respectively, treated with PIC at various concentrations (0, 20, 40, 80 μmol/L), PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor (LY294002), or pathway activator (740Y-P) plus PIC. Osteosarcoma cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to establish xenograft models, and PIC was intraperitoneally injected into models. The activity, proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle of treated cells were determined by MTT test, colony formation assay or a flow cytometry. The expressions of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins in cells and tumor tissues were measured by Western blot (WB) analysis. RESULTS: PIC (40 and 80 μmol/L) and LY294002 availably suppressed activity and proliferation and induced apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. PIC observably increased the number of cells retarded in G2 phase, but decreased the cell percentages in G1 and S phases. Conversely, 740Y-P reversed the effects of PIC on osteosarcoma cells, which promoted cell activity and proliferation and restrained apoptosis. In xenograft models, the volume and weight of the tumors treated by PIC were visibly alleviated than those untreated. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was prominently inhibited in PIC-treated osteosarcoma cells and tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: PIC suppresses the proliferation and induces apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells through regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is expected to be the therapeutic of osteosarcoma."

      "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common and complex inflammatory lung syndrome with higher morbidity and mortality rate. Piceatannol (PIC) has anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant properties. The study was designed to explore the effect and the action mechanisms of PIC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Twenty-four hours after LPS challenge, mice from different treatment groups were euthanized, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue samples were collected. Then the degree of pulmonary edema, lung pathological changes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected. Additionally, the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions associated with cell adhesion molecules and tight junction were analyzed through quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR, and the TLR4/NF-κB activation was examined by western blot. The results showed that PIC significantly inhibited LPS-induced lung edema, histopathological damage, MPO activity, cell infiltration, and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Moreover, PIC notably suppressed mRNA expressions associated with inflammation and cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, PIC also alleviated LPS-induced damage of air-blood barrier through reducing the levels of total proteins in BALF and recovering the expression of occludin and ZO-1 in the lung tissues. We also found that PIC remarkably restrained the LPS-induced TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation in lung tissues. In conclusion, PIC may be potential to treat LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) via regulating air-blood barrier and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway activation."

      "abstract": "Due to their association with type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment, α-glucosidase inhibitors have attracted increasing attention of researchers. In this study, we systemically investigated the kinetics and inhibition mechanism of piceatannol on α-glucosidase. Enzyme kinetics analyses showed that piceatannol exhibited strong inhibition on α-glucosidase in a non-competitive manner. Spectroscopy analyses indicated that piceatannol could bind with α-glucosidase to form complexes via high affinity. Further, computational molecular dynamics and molecular docking studies validated that the binding of piceatannol was outside the catalytic site of α-glucosidase, which would induce conformational changes of α-glucosidase and block the entrance of substrate, causing declines in α-glucosidase activities. Our results provide useful information not only for the inhibition mechanism of piceatannol against α-glucosidase but also for a novel target site for developing novel α-glucosidase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has documented that cancer is the second foremost reason for death worldwide. Various factors are responsible for cancer, for instance, exposure to different physical, chemical and biological carcinogens, infections, hereditary, poor dietary habits and lifestyle etc. Cancer is a preventable disease if detected at an early stage; however, most of the cases of cancer are diagnosed at an incurable advanced or metastatic stage. According to WHO about 70 % of deaths due to cancer occur in countries with low- or middle-income. The major problems associated with the conventional therapies are cancer recurrence, development of chemoresistance, affordability, late-stage diagnosis, adverse side effects and inaccessible treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need to find alternative treatment modalities, which have easy accessibility and are affordable with minimum side effects. In this article, we reviewed the natural stilbene known as \"Piceatannol\" for its anticancer properties. Numerous preclinical studies have reported the potential of Piceatannol to prevent or impede the growth of various cancers originating from different organs such as brain, breast, cervical, colon, liver, lung, prostate, skin, etc. The current review primarily emphasises on the insights of Piceatannol source, chemistry, and the molecular mechanisms involved in the regression of the tumor. This review supports Piceatannol as a potential anticancer and chemopreventive agent and suggests that it can be effectively employed as a capable anti-cancer drug.",

In the clinic, tumors with high level of PD-L1 have been used to identify patients who might respond favorably to treatment by anti-PD-L1 antibodies (PD-L1 blockade, PLB). Typically, a progression-free response of 9-20% to PLB has been observed, the basis for the low success rate is largely unknown. Recently, we show upregulation of PD-L1 in cancer cells by ≥IC50 supra-pharmacological dose of grape polyphenol resveratrol and piceatannol, alone and combined. Herein, we summarize recent published studies on the regulation of tumor PD-L1 by flavonoids and grape polyphenols. We hypothesize that the induced tumor PD-L1 by resveratrol and/or piceatannol may serve as a Search, Enhance, and Engage (\"SEE\") signal to sensitize and augment the recognition and detection of low PD-L1-expressing \"cold, non-responsive\" tumors. The \"SEE\" strategy enhances the \"visibility\" of previously unidentified tumor cells for targeting and eventual eradication by the host antitumor activity. This strategy expands the selection criteria for patients with improved sensitivity and potential responsiveness when used in combination with PLB. The modulation of tumor PD-L1 by flavonoids or polyphenols is proposed to improve the response to PLB in low PD-L1 tumors.",

It is unclear whether PFSE and its stilbene derivatives inhibit cancer cell proliferation via human glyoxalase I (GLO I), the rate-limiting enzyme for detoxification of methylglyoxal. We examined the anticancer effects of PFSE in two types of human cancer cell lines with different GLO I expression levels, NCI-H522 cells (highly-expressed GLO I) and HCT116 cells (lowly-expressed GLO I). PFSE and its stilbenes inhibited GLO I activity. In addition, PFSE and its stilbenes supressed the cancer cell proliferation of NCI-H522 cells more than HCT116 cells. These observations suggest that PFSE can provide a novel anticancer strategy for prevention and treatment."

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective potential of piceatannol (PT; 10 mg/kg body weight/day) against cadmium (Cd; 5 mg/kg body weight/day)-induced testicular dysfunction in Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, PT, Cd, and Cd + PT. RESULTS: Treatment with Cd resulted in a significant decrease in body, testicular, and epididymal weights, sperm quantity and quality, steroidogenic marker-enzyme activities, mRNA- and protein-expression levels of SF1, StAR, and P450 side chain-cleaving enzyme, and serum male sex hormonal levels when compared to controls. Testicular malondialdehyde levels were significantly increased, with a significant reduction in enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in Cd-treated rats compared to control rats. Testicular histomorphometric results supported the biochemical and molecular alterations observed in the study. In addition, significant downregulation in mRNA- and protein-expression levels of cytosolic Nrf2, HO1, γGCS, GPx, and NQO1, as well as significant upregulation in mRNA- and protein-expression levels of Nrf2 and Keap1 in testicular tissue, were noticed in rats administered Cd. PT treatment inCd-treated rats caused marked alleviation in body and organ weights, sperm analysis, steroidogenesis, serum hormonal levels, histomorphometric changes, and oxidative and antioxidative status in testes when compared to Cd alone-treated rats. Further, treatment of rats with PTl showed a marked improvement in mRNA- and protein-expression levels of Nrf2 and its regulated genes and proteins. CONCLUSION: The present study provides compelling evidence that PT treatment results in significant protection against Cd-induced testicular dysfunctions, such as spermatogenesis, steroidogenesis, and oxidative stress in rats, possibly through modification of the Nrf2-Keap1 signalling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Piceatannol (PIC) has protective effects against cardiovascular disease; however, it remains unknown whether it also protects against DCM. A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to evaluate the effects of PIC on the viability of high glucose (HG)-induced H9C2 cells. Protein expression and mRNA levels were detected by western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. In vivo, physical and biochemical analyses, together with transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements, were used to detect the effects of PIC treatment on cardiac function in DCM rats. Reactive oxygen species production was determined using an ELISA kit, and inflammatory cytokines were detected by RT-PCR. Pathological changes were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining, and TUNEL staining. According to the results, PIC treatment improved cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis in HG-induced H9C2 cardiac myoblasts. In addition, PIC not only attenuated the over-production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P < 0.05) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (P < 0.05), but also improved the expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (P < 0.05) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (P < 0.01). Importantly, knockdown of Nrf2 suppressed PIC-mediated activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and abolished its anti-inflammatory effects. In vivo, oral administration of PIC suppressed STZ-induced inflammation, oxidative stress hypertrophy, fibrosis(myocardial collagen volume fraction in 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg PIC group was decreased 25.83% and 55.61% compared with the DM group), and apoptosis(Caspase-3 level in 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg PIC group was decreased 13.21% and 33.91% compared with the DM group), thereby relieving cardiac dysfunction and improving both fibrosis and pathological changes in cardiac tissues of diabetic rats. These findings define for the first time that the effects of PIC against DCM can be attributed to its role in inflammation and oxidative stress inhibition.",

The search for new medicines that modulate the formation and function of osteoclasts is a potential approach for treating osteoclast-related bone diseases. Piceatannol (PIC) is a natural organic polyphenolic stilbene compound found in diverse plants with a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. However, the effect of PIC on bone health has not been scrutinized systematically. In this study, we used RAW264.7, an osteoclast lineage of cells of murine macrophages, to investigate the effects and the underlying mechanisms of PIC on osteoclasts. Here, we demonstrated that PIC treatment ranging from 0 to 40 µM strongly inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PIC was accompanied by the decrease of osteoclast-specific genes. At the molecular level, PIC suppressed the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), NF-κB p65, IκBα and AKT. Besides, PIC promoted the apoptosis of mature osteoclasts by inducing caspase-3 expression. In conclusion, our results suggested that PIC inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by suppressing MAPK, NF-κB and AKT signalling pathways and promoted caspase3-mediated apoptosis of mature osteoclasts, which might contribute to the treatment of bone diseases characterized by excessive bone resorption."

Piceatannol treatment significantly inhibited H2O2-induced RPE cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by 64.4% and 75.0%, respectively. Results of flow cytometry showed that H2O2-induced ARPE-19 cells apoptosis was ameliorated by piceatannol supplementation, along with decreased relative protein expressions of Bax/Bcl-2, Cleave-Caspase-3, and Cleave-PARP. Moreover, piceatannol treatment induced NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling activation, which was evidenced by increased transcription of anti-oxidant genes, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLc), SOD, and HO-1. Knockdown of Nrf2 through targeted siRNA alleviated piceatannol-mediated HO-1 transcription, and significantly abolished piceatannol-mediated cytoprotection. LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) dramatically blocked piceatannol-mediated increasing of Nrf2 nuclear translocation, HO-1 expression, and cytoprotective activity, indicating the involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway in the cytoprotective effect of piceatannol.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of PIC and RSV on parameters affecting inflammation, oxidative stress, and sirtuins (Sirt). Male C57BL/6J mice, 20 weeks old, were assigned to the following groups; (1) lean control, (2) high-fat diet control (HF), (3) HF_PIC, and (4) HF_RSV. Oral administration of PIC and RSV (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks improved glucose control as shown by decreasing levels of area under the curve (AUC) during the oral glucose tolerance test compared with HF group. PIC improved glycemic control by increasing hepatic levels of insulin receptor and AMP-activated protein kinase. PIC increased the levels of Sirt1, Sirt3, and Sirt6 and also increased two downstream targets of Sirt, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha and forkhead box O1, in the liver. The inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, in the liver were downregulated by RSV treatment. Exposure to PIC and RSV significantly lowered hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, PIC and RSV treatments showed minimal effects on hepatic markers of oxidative stress. The levels of antioxidant enzyme, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), were only increased in livers of RSV-treated mice compared with HF control mice. In conclusion, PIC was superior to an equal concentration of RSV in the regulation of Sirt and its downstream targets as well as insulin signaling-related parameters, while RSV potentially suppressed levels of proinflammatory markers and increased NQO1 protein levels.",

Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), kidney injury molecule 1, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were used as nephrotoxicity markers. Oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers were determined. In addition, the role of PIC in Nrf2 activation and its subsequent induction of antioxidant enzymes, as well as its potential cross talk with nuclear factor kappa-B, were addressed. PIC reversed cisplatin-induced elevation of nephrotoxicity markers and restored the normal kidney ultrastructure. PIC attenuated cisplatin-induced reduction in Nrf2 expression and the relative mRNA level of antioxidant enzymes: hemeoxygenase-1, cysteine ligase catalytic, and modifier subunits, as well as superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities. Cisplatin pro-inflammatory response was reduced by PIC treatment as evidenced by the suppression of nuclear factor kappa-B activation and the subsequent decreased tissue levels of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. PIC suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis by decreasing p53 and cytochrome C expression and caspase-3 activity. Therefore, PIC may protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by modulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and hindering the inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.",

In this study, we screened for microorganisms capable of producing piceatannol from resveratrol via regioselective hydroxylation. In the first screening, we isolated microorganisms utilizing resveratrol, phenol, or 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid as a carbon source for growth. In the second screening, we assayed the isolated microorganisms for hydroxylation of resveratrol. Using this screening procedure, a variety of resveratrol-converting microorganisms were obtained. One Gram-negative bacterium, Ensifer sp. KSH1, and one Gram-positive bacterium, Arthrobacter sp. KSH3, utilized 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid as a carbon source for growth and efficiently hydroxylated resveratrol to piceatannol without producing any detectable by-products. The hydroxylation activity of strains KSH1 and KSH3 was strongly induced by cultivation with 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid as a carbon source during stationary growth phase. Using the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid-induced cells as a biocatalyst under optimal conditions, production of piceatannol by strains KSH1 and KSH3 reached 3.6 mM (0.88 g/L) and 2.6 mM (0.64 g/L), respectively. We also cloned genes homologous to the monooxygenase gene hpaBC from strains KSH1 and KSH3. Introduction of either hpaBC homolog into Escherichia coli endowed the host with resveratrol-hydroxylating activity.",

We also evaluated its effects on hydrogen peroxide-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species in C2C12 myotubes. Treatment with PIC led to dose-dependent upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) mRNA expression in C2C12 myotubes. PIC was the most potent inducer of Ho-1 among the PIC analogues and major polyphenols tested. In addition, treatment with PIC suppressed the hydrogen peroxide-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. Our results suggest that PIC protects skeletal muscles from oxidative stress by activating antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 and SOD1 and can therefore help prevent oxidative stress-induced muscle dysfunction such as muscle fatigue and sarcopenia."

Recently, it has been demonstrated to exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in various human cancer types. The aim of our study was to investigate whether piceatannol induces autophagy and apoptosis in MOLT-4 human leukemia cells. Our results revealed that piceatannol activated autophagy in MOLT-4 cells, as evidenced by the detection of an increased level of LC3-II protein and a concomitant decrease in p62/SQSTM1 protein level. Moreover, piceatannol induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells which was accompanied by phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, PARP1 cleavage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of cell nuclei. However, the toxic effects exerted by piceatannol in MOLT4 cells diminished after longer periods of exposure to the compound. Our findings imply that MOLT-4 cells may acquire resistance to piceatannol toxicity, which may result from the induction of efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein. The present study provides new data showing that the use of piceatannol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia may be associated with the risk of multidrug resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several components isolated from rhubarb, the root of Rheum undulatum L., including emodin, rhein, rhaponticin, and piceatannol, have been reported to induce cell death and inhibit metastasis in various types of cancer. Recently, piceatannol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (PG) isolated from rhubarb was demonstrated to improve vascular dysfunction by inhibiting arginase activity. PURPOSE: In this study, we examined the anti-cancer activities of PG, including effects on the proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis of endothelial and malignant cancer cells. RESULTS: We found that PG did not affect the proliferation of human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at treatments up to 100  μM. However, PG efficiently suppressed the metastatic ability of HT1080 cells, as determined by scratch wound migration, transwell migration/invasion assay, and three-dimensional (3D) spheroid invasion assay. PG significantly suppressed the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced increase of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression as well as gelatinolytic MMP-9 activity, which are essential for cancer metastasis. In addition, PG treatment reduced the production of proangiogenic factors in HT1080 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and suppressed hypoxia-induced activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α pathway. We also found that HUVEC angiogenic activity, including migration and tubular structure formation, were significantly reduced by PG treatment. Moreover, in an in ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, spontaneous and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced vessel formation were significantly inhibited by PG treatment. CONCLUSION: These results collectively indicate that PG has potent anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic activities with no cytotoxicity. Thus, PG may be useful to limit the hyperplasia of malignant tumors and the spread of cancer to distant secondary organs.",

      "abstract": "Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‑L1) expressed in cancer cells interacting with its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD‑1) expressed in immune cells represents a regulatory axis linked to the suppression and evasion of host immune functions. The blockade of PD‑1/PD‑L1 interaction using monoclonal antibodies has emerged as an effective therapy for several solid tumors; however, durable response has been observed in a subset of patients with PD‑L1-positive tumors. Thus, the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the expression of PD‑L1 in tumor cells may help to improve the response to PD‑L1 blockade therapies. In this study, we investigated whether resveratrol, a grape-derived stilbenoid with immunoregulatory activity, modulates the expression of PD‑L1 in breast and colorectal cancer cells. The surface expression of PD‑L1 was determined by flow cytometry in cancer cells treated with resveratrol and/or piceatannol. Each stilbenoid alone induced PD‑L1 and when used in combination, elicited a synergistic upregulation of PD‑L1 in some cell lines. The induction of PD‑L1 by the combined use of stilbenoids was most pronounced in the Cal51 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and SW620 colon cancer cells. The observed induction of PD‑L1 was transcriptionally mediated by nuclear factor (NF)-κB, as shown by NF‑κB reporter assays, the nuclear accumulation of the p65 subunit of NF‑κB, inhibition by the IKK inhibitor, BMS‑345541, and histone the modification inhibitors, resminostat, entinostat or anacardic acid. Combined treatment with resveratrol and piceatannol also decreased tumor cell survival as indicated by the upregulation of the DNA damaging marker, γH2AX, the cleavage of caspase 3, the downregulation of the survival markers, p38-MAPK/c‑Myc, and G1-to-S cell cycle arrest.",

      "abstract": "Phenolic compounds are among the most investigated herbal remedies, as is especially the case for resveratrol. Many reports have shown its anti-aging properties and the ability to reduce obesity and diabetes induced by high-fat diet in mice. However, such beneficial effects hardly translate from animal models to humans. The scientific community has therefore tested whether other plant phenolic compounds may surpass the effects of resveratrol. In this regard, it has been reported that piceatannol reproduces in rodents the anti-obesity actions of its parent polyphenol. However, the capacity of piceatannol to inhibit adipocyte differentiation in humans has not been characterized so far. Here, we investigated whether piceatannol was antiadipogenic and antilipogenic in human preadipocytes. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), isolated from adipose tissues of lean and obese individuals, were differentiated into mature adipocytes with or without piceatannol, and their functions were explored. Fifty μM of piceatannol deeply limited synthesis/accumulation of lipids in both murine and hMSC-derived adipocytes. Interestingly, this phenomenon occurred irrespective of being added at the earlier or later stages of adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, piceatannol lowered glucose transport into adipocytes and decreased the expression of key elements of the lipogenic pathway (PPARγ, FAS, and GLUT4). Thus, the confirmation of the antiadipogenic properties of piceatanol in vitro warrants the realization of clinical studies for the application of this compound in the treatment of the metabolic complications associated with obesity.",

Piceatannol significantly restored MG-induced reductions in cell viability and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release in MG-treated MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, which suggests that it suppressed MG-induced cytotoxicity. Piceatannol also increased glyoxalase I activity and glutathione levels in MG-treated cells, which indicates that it enhanced the glyoxalase system and thus cellular protection. The present study also showed that piceatannol inhibited the generation of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction induced by MG. Furthermore, piceatannol treatment significantly reduced the levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy induced by MG. Therefore, piceatannol could be a potent option for the development of antiglycating agents for the treatment of diabetic osteopathy.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a complex process that is accompanied by neurological damage. Chronic injection of d-galactose (d-gal) can accelerate the aging process similar to natural aging and is commonly used to build an aging model to investigate aging. In the present study, the effects of piceatannol on d-gal-induced aging in mice were evaluated. Piceatannol treatment showed an observable anti-aging effect. Results obtained in vivo showed that piceatannol retained spontaneous motor activity and enhanced spatial learning and memory abilities in mice in which aging was induced by d-gal. Morphometric analysis displayed that piceatannol prevented d-gal-induced neuronal loss, increased the number of Nissl bodies, and promoted cell proliferation in the hippocampus and cortex. Piceatannol also significantly decreased the level of MDA and elevated SOD and CAT activity in the hippocampal and cortical tissues. Furthermore, western blotting results revealed that piceatannol treatment noticeably reversed the suppression of Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increased the expressions of HO-1 and NOQ1 in mice with aging induced by d-gal. Furthermore, piceatannol activated the Nrf2 pathway in natural aging mice, whereas treatment with the Nrf2 inhibitor brusatol reversed the increased expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NOQ1. In conclusion, treatment with piceatannol ameliorates behavioral disorder and brain injury in an aging mouse model; this suggests that piceatannol is a promising pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of age-associated diseases.",

We have previously reported that resveratrol and synthetic analogs of resveratrol with a higher bioavailability inhibit the synthesis of androgens in human adrenocortical H295R cells. Now we have studied the antiandrogenic properties of resveratrol, piceatannol and analogs in two different prostate cell lines; LNCaP and RWPE. LNCaP carry a T877A mutation in the androgen receptor while RWPE has a wild-type androgen receptor. We found that resveratrol, piceatannol and all studied analogs were able to inhibit a dihydrotestosterone-induced activation of the androgen receptor, showing that they act as antiandrogens. In LNCaP cells, all studied compounds were able to statistically significantly decrease the androgenic signaling in concentrations ≥1μM and the synthetic analogs trimethylresveratrol (RSVTM) and tetramethylpiceatannol (PICTM) were the most potent compounds. RWPE cells were not as responsive to the studied compounds as the LNCaP cells. A statistically significant decrease in the androgenic signaling was observed at concentrations ≤5μM for most compounds and RSVTM was found to be the most potent compound. Further, we studied the effects of resveratrol, piceatannol and analogs on the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in LNCaP cells and found that all studied compounds decreased the level of PSA and that the synthetic analogs diacetylresveratrol (RSVDA), triacetylresveratrol (RSVTA) and RSVTM were the most potent compounds, decreasing the PSA level by approx. 50% at concentrations ≥10μM. In a cell-free receptor binding assay we were unable to show binding of resveratrol or analogs to the ligand binding domain of the androgen receptor, indicating that the observed effects are mediated via other mechanisms than direct ligand competition. We conclude that the resveratrol, piceatannol and analogs are highly interesting for chemoprevention of prostate cancer, since they have a high potency both as inhibitors of androgen synthesis and androgen receptor activation.",

      "abstract": "Advanced age is one of the risk factors for vascular diseases that are mainly caused by impaired nitric oxide (NO) production. It has been demonstrated that endothelial arginase constrains the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and limits NO generation. Hence, arginase inhibition is suggested to be vasoprotective in aging. In this study, we examined the effects of intravenous injection of Piceatannol, an arginase inhibitor, on aged mice. Our results show that Piceatannol administration reduced the blood pressure in aged mice by inhibiting arginase activity, which was associated with NO production and reactive oxygen species generation. In addition, Piceatannol administration recovered Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation, eNOS phosphorylation and eNOS dimer stability in the aged mice. The improved NO signaling was shown to be effective in attenuating the phenylephrine-dependent contractile response and in enhancing the acetylcholine-dependent vasorelaxation response in aortic rings from the aged mice. These data suggest Piceatannol as a potential treatment for vascular disease."

In endothelial cells (ECs), the sulfur-containing amino acid homocysteine (Hcy) causes EC apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through induction of ER stress. Here, we have investigated whether piceatannol (Pic), a resveratrol analog, could protect ECs against Hcy-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and ER stress, with specific emphasis on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). In human ECs, we determined the effects of Hcy and Pic on annexin V positivity, glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression, X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp-1) mRNA slicing, and ROS-sensitive dihydroethidium (DHE) oxidation. Hcy increased annexin V-positive cells, DHE oxidation, GRP78 and CHOP expression and Xbp-1 mRNA splicing, indicating that Hcy induces apoptosis, oxidative stress and ER stress. Pretreatment of ECs with Pic significantly inhibited Hcy-induced apoptosis, ROS generation and ER stress. Pic also increased HO-1 expression via activation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of Pic on Hcy-induced apoptosis, ROS generation and ER stress were abolished by down-regulation of HO-1 expression, while mimicked by treatment of ECs with the HO-1 inducer hemin. Overall, these results suggest that Pic may protect ECs against Hcy-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and ER stress via Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression.",

We investigated the effect of piceatannol on renal fibrosis and histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Fibrosis was established by UUO and piceatannol was intraperitoneally injected for 2 weeks. Piceatannol suppressed extracellular matrix (ECM) protein deposition including collagen type I and fibronectin as well as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in UUO kidneys. However, the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker genes, such as N-cadherin and E-cadherin, were not changed in the kidneys after UUO. Masson's trichrome staining and fluorescence immunostaining showed that piceatannol administration attenuated collagen deposition in UUO kidneys. HDAC1, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, and HDAC10 protein expression was upregulated in UUO kidneys, whereas that of HDAC8 was downregulated. Piceatannol treatment significantly reduced HDAC4 and HDAC5 protein expression. Further, piceatannol attenuated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) in UUO kidneys, but not that of transforming growth factor beta1-Smad2/3. These results suggest that class I HDACs and class IIa/b HDACs are involved in renal fibrosis development. Piceatannol may be a beneficial therapeutic agent for treating renal fibrosis via reduction of HDAC4 and HDAC5 protein expression or suppression of the p38-MAPK signaling pathway.",

In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity effect of Pic in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese animal model. The results showed that Pic significantly reduced mouse body weight in a dose-dependent manner without affecting food intake. Serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and blood glucose (GLU) were significantly lowered in Pic-treated groups. Pic significantly decreased the weight of liver, spleen, perigonadal and retroperitoneal fat compared with the HFD group. Pic significantly reduced the adipocyte cell size of perigonadal fat and decreased the weight of liver. Pic-treated mice showed higher phosphorylated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (pACC) protein levels and decreased protein levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein C/EBPα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARγ and fatty acid synthase (FAS), resulting in decreased lipid accumulation in adipocytes and the liver. Pic altered the composition of the gut microbiota by increasing Firmicutes and Lactobacillus and decreasing Bacteroidetes compared with the HFD group. Collectively, these results suggest that Pic may be a candidate for obesity treatment.",

      "abstract": "Piceatannol is a hydroxylated derivative of resveratrol. While both dietary polyphenols coexist in edible plants and fruits, and share equivalent concentrations in several wines, the influence of piceatannol on adiposity has been less studied than that of resveratrol. Though resveratrol is now recognized to limit fat deposition in various obesity models, the benefit of its dietary supplementation remains under debate regarding human obesity treatment or prevention. The research for more potent resveratrol analogs is therefore still undergoing. This prompted us to compare various effects of piceatannol and resveratrol directly on human adipose tissue (hAT). Hydrogen peroxide release was measured by Amplex Red-based fluorescence in subcutaneous hAT samples from obese patients. Interactions of stilbenes with human amine oxidases and quinone reductase were assessed by radiometric methods, computational docking and electron paramagnetic resonance. Influences on lipogenic and lipolytic activities were compared in mouse adipocytes. Resveratrol and piceatannol inhibited monoamine oxidase (MAO) with respective IC50 of 18.5 and 133.7 μM, but not semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) in hAT. For both stilbenes, the docking scores were better for MAO than for SSAO. Piceatannol and resveratrol similarly hampered hydrogen peroxide detection in assays with and without hAT, while they shared pro-oxidant activities when incubated with purified quinone reductase. They exhibited similar dose-dependent inhibition of adipocyte lipogenic activity. Only piceatannol inhibited basal and stimulated lipolysis when incubated at a dose ≥100 μM. Thus, piceatannol exerted on fat cells dose-dependent effects similar to those of resveratrol, except for a stronger antilipolytic action. In this regard, piceatannol should be useful in limiting the lipotoxicity related to obesity when ingested or administered alone - or might hamper the fat mobilization induced by resveratrol when simultaneously administered with it.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Piceatannol, an analog and metabolite of resveratrol, is effective against various disorders including malignancy. It is in part effective by triggering suicidal death or apoptosis of tumor cells. Cellular mechanisms mediating the proapoptotic effect of Piceatannol include mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release. Erythrocytes lack mitochondria but may nevertheless enter suicidal death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Cellular mechanisms involved in the triggering of eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca2+ activity ([Ca2+]i), oxidative stress and ceramide formation. The present study explored, whether Piceatannol induces eryptosis and, if so, to shed some light on the cellular mechanisms involved. METHODS: Phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface was estimated from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, [Ca2+]i from Fluo3-fluorescence, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation from 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) diacetate-dependent fluorescence, and ceramide abundance utilizing specific antibodies. Hemoglobin concentration in the supernatant was taken as measure of hemolysis. RESULTS: A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to Piceatannol (10 - 20 µM) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells, significantly decreased forward scatter, significantly increased DCFDA-fluorescence, significantly increased ceramide abundance, but did not significantly increase Fluo3-fluorescence. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ slightly blunted but did not abolish the effect of Piceatannol on annexin-V-binding and forward scatter. Piceatannol (20 µM) significantly augmented the increase of annexin-V-binding, but significantly blunted the decrease of forward scatter following treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Piceatannol triggers cell shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the erythrocyte cell membrane, an effect at least in part downstream of Ca2+ and involving oxidative stress and ceramide formation.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is a diverse class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth that constitutes the greatest cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Despite steady progress, the treatment modalities of cancer are still insufficient. Several new concepts have emerged for therapeutic intervention in malignant diseases with the goal of identifying specific targets and overcoming resistance against current cytotoxic therapies. Many studies have reported the remarkable and significant properties of dietary plant polyphenols such as curcumin, resveratrol, flavopiridol, indirubin, magnolol, piceatannol, parthenolide, epigallocatechin gallate, and cucurbitacin as anticancer agents known for their pleiotropic effects on cancer, immune cells, and inflammation. Piceatannol, an analogue and metabolite of resveratrol, is a natural stilbene commonly found in grape skins and wine. Compared to resveratrol, this molecule exhibits superior bioactivities as an inhibitor of COX-1/2 and the CSN-associated kinase. Piceatannol is thought to be a potent natural compound with many therapeutic effects, such as the prevention of hypercholesterolemia, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, and cardiovascular diseases. It also demonstrates vasorelaxation, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. This comprehensive review summarizes the current data regarding the mechanisms of action of piceatannol, its chemopreventive properties, and its possible therapeutic potential against various types of human cancer.",

In the present study, the effects of piceatannol (PT) and pterostilbene (PS) against Aβ-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells were evaluated. PT and PS both showed observable anti-apoptosis activity. Increased cell viability, decreased apoptosis rate and declining intracellular ROS were observed after PT and PS treatment. For the signaling pathway, PT significantly promoted phosphorylation of Akt and Bad, further suppressed Bcl-2/Bax expression and inhibited cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP. PS promoted phosphorylation of Akt without affecting the other factors. The experimental results, for the first time, unambiguously suggested that PT showed a comprehensive protective effect against Aβ-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells via a novel PI3K/Akt/Bad signaling pathway and downstream mitochondria-mediated and caspase-dependent signaling pathway. Unlike PT, PS inhibited apoptosis against Aβ through a different PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in which the downstream targets need to be further investigated. The results also provide the basis for dietary intervention involved in the prevention and adjunctive therapy of AD.",

Resveratrol supplementation represents a promising therapy to attenuate kidney injury, but the poor solubility and limited bioavailability of this polyphenol limits its use in dietary intervention. Piceatannol, a resveratrol analogue, has been suggested as a better option. In this study, we aimed to provide evidence of a preventive action of piceatannol in very early stages of obesity-associated nephropathy. Thirty obese Zucker rats were divided into three experimental groups: one control and two groups orally treated for 6 weeks with 15 and 45 mg piceatannol/kg body weight/day. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to determine renal and urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), renal fibrosis markers (transforming growth factor β1 and fibronectin) and renal sirtuin-1 protein. Oxidative stress was assessed in the kidney by measuring lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substrates and 3-nitrotyrosine levels, respectively) together with the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase. Renal fatty acids profile analysis was performed by thin-layer and gas chromatography. Piceatannol-treated rats displayed lower levels of urinary and renal Kim-1. Renal fibrosis biomarkers and lipid peroxidation exhibited a tendency to decrease in the piceatannol-treated groups. Piceatannol treatment did not modify superoxide dismutase activity or sirtuin-1 protein levels, while it seemed to increase the levels of polyunsaturated and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the kidneys. Our findings suggest a mild renoprotective effect of piceatannol in obese Zucker rats and the need of intervention at early stages of renal damage.",

      "abstract": "To enhance the anticancer efficacy of gemcitabine in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the potential synergistic effect of piceatannol on gemcitabine cytotoxicity was investigated in the human NSCLC A459 cell line. The MTT cell viability assay showed that piceatannol significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine by lowering the gemcitabine IC50 value. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that piceatannol exerted its pharmacological effect mainly by increasing the late apoptotic population. Western blot analysis showed that gemcitabine induced the expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bad and Bak, and pretreatment with piceatannol further increased Bak expression, leading to an increased number of cells undergoing late apoptosis. The findings from this study show that piceatannol can enhance the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine by enhancing expression of the proapoptotic protein Bak, thereby providing the rational basis for a novel combination strategy for the treatment of NSCLC.",

      "abstract": "Piceatannol, a polyphenol which exhibits anticancer activities, is found in grapes, red wine and berries. It has been shown to inhibit several transcription factor pathways. The present study was conducted to determine whether oral administration of piceatannol inhibits mammary tumor progression. 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic female BALB/c mice. Starting 1 day later, piceatannol (10- or 20-mg/kg body weight/day) was administered by oral gavage for 30 days. Piceatannol treatment reduced tumor growth. In tumor tissues, piceatannol treatment reduced the expression of transcription factors P-NFκB p65, P-STAT3 and HIF-1α and multiple proteins involved in regulation of cell cycle progression (Ki67, cyclin D1, cyclin A, CDK2, CDK4), angiogenesis (VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, VE-cadherin, CD31) and lymphangiogenesis (VEGF-C, LYVE-1), as well as macrophage infiltration. Piceatannol significantly increased apoptotic cells and expression of both Bax and cleaved caspase-3 but reduced Bcl-2 expression in tumor tissues. In addition, piceatannol reduced the number and volume of pulmonary tumor nodules and expression of MMP-9 in both lung and tumor. It also reduced tissue levels of cytokines/chemokines, including M-CSF and MCP-1. In vitro results revealed that piceatannol inhibited migration of 4T1 cells and monocytes, as well as secretion of MCP-1 and M-CSF by 4T1 cells. 4T1 cell-conditioned medium stimulated monocyte migration, which was suppressed by a CCR2 antibody. These results indicate that alteration in tumor microenvironment (macrophages, transcription factors, etc.) is an important mechanism by which piceatannol inhibits tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, leading to suppression of mammary tumor growth and metastasis.",

      "abstract": "Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) produces stilbenoids upon exposure to abiotic and biotic stresses. Among these compounds, the prenylated stilbenoids arachidin-1 and arachidin-3 have shown diverse biological activities with potential applications in human health. These compounds exhibit higher or novel biological activities in vitro when compared to their nonprenylated analogues piceatannol and resveratrol, respectively. However, assessment of these bioactivities in vivo has been challenging because of their limited availability. In this study, hairy root cultures of peanut were induced to produce stilbenoids upon treatment with elicitors. Co-treatment with 100 μM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 9 g/L methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) led to sustained high levels of resveratrol, piceatannol, arachidin-1, and arachidin-3 in the culture medium when compared to other elicitor treatments. The average yields of arachidin-1 and arachidin-3 were 56 and 148 mg/L, respectively, after co-treatment with MeJA and CD. Furthermore, MeJA and CD had a synergistic effect on resveratrol synthase gene expression, which could explain the higher yield of resveratrol when compared to treatment with either MeJA or CD alone. Peanut hairy root cultures were shown to be a controlled and sustainable axenic system for the production of the diverse types of biologically active stilbenoids.",

Although the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumorigenesis activity of piceatannol has been extensively studied, its role in the adaptive immune response has received less attention. Here we investigated the role of piceatannol, a well-known Syk inhibitor, in T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation using isolated murine splenic T cells from C57BL/6 mice. Piceatannol treatment inhibited surface expression of CD4 and CD8 T cell activation markers CD25 and CD69, reduced production of cytokines IFNγ, IL-2, and IL-17, and suppressed proliferation of activated T cells. Moreover, piceatannol treatment significantly inhibited differentiation of CD4(+)CD25(-)CD62L(+) naïve CD4 T cells into Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, presumably due to inhibition of TcR signaling through p-Erk, p-Akt, and p-p38. Piceatannol appears to be a useful nutritional or pharmacological biomolecule that regulates effector T cell functions such as cytokine production, differentiation, and proliferation.",

Recently, the absorption and metabolism of piceatannol were investigated in rats, and isorhapontigenin, O-methyl piceatannol, was detected as a piceatannol metabolite in rat plasma. To elucidate the function of piceatannol and its metabolites, we investigated the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in THP-1 monocytic cells after treatment with piceatannol and its metabolites, and compared their effects with those of resveratrol and its metabolites. Piceatannol and resveratrol upregulated the expression levels of SIRT1 mRNA and SIRT1 protein. An extract of passion fruit seeds, which contained high levels of piceatannol, also upregulated SIRT1 mRNA expression. As for the metabolites, isorhapontigenin upregulated SIRT1 mRNA expression, whereas resveratrol glucuronides and sulfate did not affect SIRT1 expression. These findings indicate that after intake of piceatannol, not only piceatannol itself, but also its metabolite, isorhapontigenin, contributed to the upregulation of SIRT1 expression.",

      "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of clonal B lymphocytes. Proliferation occurs in lymphoid tissues upon interaction of leukemic cells with a supportive microenvironment. Therefore, the mobilization of tissue-resident CLL cells into the circulation is a useful therapeutic strategy to minimize the reservoir of tumor cells within survival niches. Because the exit of normal lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues depends on the presence of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) and the regulated expression of S1P receptor-1 (S1PR1), we investigated whether the expression and function of S1PR1 can be modulated by key microenvironment signals. We found that activation of CLL cells with CXCL12, fibroblast CD40L(+), BCR cross-linking, or autologous nurse-like cells reduces their S1PR1 expression and the migratory response toward S1P. Moreover, we found that S1PR1 expression was reduced in the proliferative/activated subset of leukemic cells compared with the quiescent subset from the same patient. Similarly, bone marrow-resident CLL cells expressing high levels of the activation marker CD38 showed a lower expression of S1PR1 compared with CD38(low) counterparts. Finally, given that treatment with BCR-associated kinase inhibitors induces a transient redistribution of leukemic cells from lymphoid tissues to circulation, we studied the effect of the Syk inhibitors piceatannol and R406 on S1PR1 expression and function. We found that they enhance S1PR1 expression in CLL cells and their migratory response toward S1P. Based on our results, we suggest that the regulated expression of S1PR1 might modulate the egress of the leukemic clone from lymphoid tissues.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resveratrol (RSV) and resveratrol analogs have a potential use in prostate cancer chemoprevention due to effects on for example, cell growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, inhibition of CYP17A1, a key enzyme in the androgen biosynthesis and a target for prostate cancer therapy, has not been explored as a possible mechanism behind the effects on prostate cancer. METHODS: Human adrenocortical carcinoma cells, H295R, were treated with RSV, piceatannol (PIC), 3,5,4'-triacetylresveratrol (RSVTA), 3,5-diacetylresveratrol (RSVDA), and 3,5,4'-trimethylresveratrol (RSVTM) for 24 hr at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 µM. Steroid secretion, enzyme activities, and gene expression of key steps in steroidogenesis were investigated. RESULTS: Secretion of dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, and cortisol were drastically decreased by all test compounds at concentrations that did not affect cell viability. Progesterone and aldosterone secretion were increased. This steroid secretion pattern can be explained by the demonstrated inhibition of CYP17A1 enzyme activity. The most efficient CYP17A1 inhibitors were the synthetic analogs RSVTA, RSVDA, and RSVTM. Inhibition by RSVTM was more selective on the 17,20-lyase activity than hydroxylase activity of CYP17A1. Treatment of cells with all compounds, except RSVTM, caused increased estradiol levels, which could be explained by the demonstrated inhibition of estrogen sulfate conjugation, catalyzed by SULT1E1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results on CYP17A1 inhibition of RSV and RSV analogs suggest a novel mechanism for chemoprevention of prostate cancer by resveratrol and the analogs. Especially RSVTM, which has a preferential inhibition on the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A1, may be a promising candidate for prostate cancer chemoprevention.",

Patients need to be dependent on habitual blood transfusion and on unaffordable exorbitant therapies for continued existence. It has been hypothesized that if the level of foetal Haemoglobin increases, it compensates the need of adult Haemoglobin and hence, ameliorates clinical symptoms associated with beta thalassaemia major. Illation from previous studies has proved that reactivation of foetal Haemoglobin with the aid of natural compounds is a better alternative therapy for patients of beta thalassaemia because of its cost effectiveness and occurrence in natural eatables. Piceatannol, a naturally occurring stilbene, is less studied compound in comparison to resveratrol, but it shows a wide range of biological activities. This article has mainly focused on piceatannol and its application as a foetal Haemoglobin inducer in future."
