      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression has become a global public health problem. In recent years, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has gained considerable attention as a non-invasive treatment for depression. AIM: To investigate the research hotspots and trends in the field of TMS-based depression treatment from a bibliometric perspective. METHODS: Using the Web of Science Core Collection, articles published between 2003 and 2022 on TMS-based depression treatment were retrieved from the science citation index expanded. The publication trends and research hotspots were analyzed using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the bibliometric online analysis platform. Regression analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2021 to predict publication growth trends. RESULTS: We identified a total of 702 articles on TMS-based depression treatment with a predominance of clinical studies. Analysis of collaborative networks showed that the United States, the University of Toronto, and Daskalakis ZJ were identified as the most impactful country, institution, and researcher, respectively. In keyword burst analysis, it was found that theta burst stimulation (TBS), functional connectivity, and frequency were the most recent research hotspots. CONCLUSION: TMS provides a novel therapeutic option for patients with treatment-resistant depression. Neuroimaging technology enables more precise TMS treatment, while the novel TMS modality, TBS, enhances both therapeutic efficacy and patient experience in TMS-based depression treatment. The integration of neuroimaging techniques with TBS represents a promising research direction for advancing TMS-based depression treatment. This study presents systematic information and recommendations to guide future research on TMS-based depression treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) with a low incidence of adverse effects. However, bradycardia is not commonly recognized as an adverse effect of rTMS. In this case report, we present the first documented instance of a patient with MDD and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) who developed severe bradycardia following rTMS treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 46-year-old Chinese woman with a 7-year history of MDD and a 6-year history of PVCs. She had been taking paroxetine, tandospirone citrate, and metoprolol long-term without experiencing bradycardia. After initiating rTMS treatment, she developed severe bradycardia. Even after discontinuing metoprolol, the severe bradycardia persisted for several days. Notably, the severe bradycardia disappeared one day after pausing rTMS therapy. When rTMS was resumed, the bradycardia reoccurred and subsequently resolved again upon pausing the rTMS treatment. CONCLUSION: The influence of rTMS on heart rate (HR) is likely mediated through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Currently, severe arrhythmias are not widely recognized as adverse effects of rTMS. While the exact mechanisms by which rTMS affects the cardiovascular system remain unclear, this case underscores the necessity for caution when using rTMS to treat psychiatric patients with arrhythmias.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders with a higher lifetime prevalence than schizophrenia, often showing inadequate response to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of adjunctive deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) in a randomized, sham-controlled set-up, addressing inadequate response to standard treatments. METHODS: Forty-nine obsessive-compulsive disorder patients were randomly allocated to receive either high-frequency dTMS (20 Hz) or sham stimulation and received 10 sessions of treatment using the H7 coil to target the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex over a period of 2 weeks. Change in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores was the primary outcome measure. Secondary efficacy measures were changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and response rates as measured by Y-BOCS. RESULTS: The active dTMS group demonstrated a significant reduction in Y-BOCS scores compared with sham (-10.4 vs -2.6 points; P < 0.001), with an effect size of 1.39. Full response rates were 75% in the active group versus 5% in the sham group (P < 0.001). Anxiety and depressive symptoms also improved significantly in the active group (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale: -9.1 vs -2.4 points, P < 0.001; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: -5.9 vs -1.8 points, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that dTMS targeting the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex significantly improved obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, with faster response rates and fewer sessions compared with previous trials, suggesting that dTMS may serve as an effective early intervention for a wider range of obsessive-compulsive disorder patients."

      "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a group of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the progressive incoordination of gait, impaired motor control, and various neurological deficits. Therapeutic options for SCA remain limited. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has gained attention as a potential intervention due to its non-invasive nature, ease of application, and favorable safety profile. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in SCA, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify RCTs assessing rTMS for SCA management. The primary outcomes of interest included changes in motor function as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) or the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Our analysis included eight RCTs involving a total of 237 participants. Meta-analysis results demonstrated statistically significant improvements in motor function. Specifically, SARA scores showed a mean difference (MD) of -1.56 (95% confidence interval, CI: -2.88 to -0.24; p = 0.02), and ICARS scores improved with an MD of -3.16 (95% CI: -3.93 to -2.39; p < 0.001) compared to a sham group. To evaluate the effects of different rTMS protocols on SCA, we performed subgroup analyses of low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF), and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). We revealed that LF (MD: -1.60, 95% CI: -3.06 to -0.13, p = 0.03) and iTBS (MD: -1.68, 95% CI: -2.29 to -1.08, p < 0.001) were effective in significantly improving SARA. The HF group showed a reduction in SARA scores (MD: -1.52, 95% CI: -6.34 to 3.30, p = 0.54) but without significance because of the small sample size. These findings indicate that overall rTMS is a promising therapeutic approach for alleviating motor symptoms in hereditary SCA patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Chronic tinnitus affects approximately 10%-15% of the population. The long-term presence of severe tinnitus significantly impacts affected individuals' quality of life and emotional state. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique that employs pulsed magnetic fields to modulate neural activity. rTMS is considered a promising treatment strategy for chronic tinnitus. However, the therapeutic effect of rTMS on subjective chronic tinnitus remains inconclusive, and its validity is still a subject of debate among researchers. METHODS: To identify RCTs investigating rTMS for subjective chronic tinnitus, a comprehensive computerized search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China Knowledge, WIPO, Wanfang, and the China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). The search timeframe spanned from the inception of each database to 2 June 2024. Two independent investigators performed literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 software. RESULTS: Sixteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,105 chronic tinnitus patients were included. RTMS was superior to Sham rTMS in THI and VAS and had a positive effect on the short-term impact of THI (1 month), Still, this meta-analysis did not observe a positive effect of rTMS on the long-term implications of tinnitus (6 months). rTMS had no significant immediate effect on TQ and LM scores on tinnitus questionnaires. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrated that rTMS has some efficacy in chronic tinnitus. However, more RCTs are needed to validate its effectiveness, to support the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for tinnitus with larger sample sizes and more follow-up data, and to explore the potential benefits of rTMS in chronic tinnitus.

      "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applies electromagnetic pulses to stimulate cortical neurons. The antidepressant effect of the repetitive application of TMS (rTMS) was first shown nearly three decades ago. The therapeutic potential of TMS has been extensively investigated, mostly in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Studies have extensively evaluated stimulation parameters, treatment schedules, methods to localize the stimulation target, and different magnetic coil designs engineered for desired stimulation breadth and depth. Several of these stimulation protocols and coils/devices have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for application in TRD and other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some stimulation protocols, while not FDA-cleared, have substantial clinical trial-derived evidence to support their safety and antidepressant efficacy. The proliferation of rTMS translational and clinical research has resulted in the field's advancement. This clinician-oriented review contains an overview of fundamental TMS principles, physiological effects, and studies of rTMS in TRD. Also discussed are two innovations that are increasingly applied in the clinic: theta burst stimulation and accelerated scheduling. A synthesis of the key clinical considerations given to patient assessment and safety, treatment setup, and the minimization and management of adverse effects is provided."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome is primarily caused by myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)-associated dysfunction of the central nervous system. Postural instability or disequilibrium is a typical neural sign and is classified as static or kinetic. METHODS: A total of 160 ME patients (53 males and 107 females) with a mean age of 37 ± 12 years were enrolled in this study. They underwent both the Romberg test for static disequilibrium and the tandem gait test with turn and return for kinetic disequilibrium. RESULTS: Static disequilibrium was found in 40 (25%) patients who showed instability when standing with both feet together and eyes either open (n = 7, 4%) or closed (n = 33, 21%). Kinetic disequilibrium was found in 71 (44%) patients, with 57 (36%) being positive for the straight tandem gait test. Fourteen (9%) patients were negative for the straight tandem gait test, but showed a positive result after turning and returning. Almost all patients with static disequilibrium also had kinetic disequilibrium (39/40, 98%). Patients with static and/or kinetic disequilibrium had a significantly higher prevalence of orthostatic intolerance, diagnosed as failure to complete the 10-min standing test, compared with patients without disequilibrium. They also had a significantly higher median performance status score (0-9) for restricted activities of daily living. Both types of disequilibria were recovered in 11 (85%) of 13 patients treated with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and primary motor area in the brain, suggesting a central vestibular origin. CONCLUSIONS: Static disequilibrium related to orthostatic intolerance, and kinetic disequilibrium related to gait disturbance are both prevalent in patients with ME and are important central neural signs that restrict activities of daily living. rTMS treatment effectively alleviated these disequilibria.

      "abstract": "Although antipsychotic medications are effective in managing schizophrenia (SCZ), there are still no effective strategies or preventive measures to address the weight gain associated with the long-term use of these medications. We performed a single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial to explore the efficacy of noninvasive high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technology in reducing body weight in patients with SCZ. Fifty-three obese patients with chronic stable SCZ (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) completed a 4-week intervention study. The primary outcomes were the changes in body weight and body mass index (BMI) before and after the rTMS intervention. Secondary outcomes included changes in psychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, and routine blood indicators before and after the rTMS intervention. Significant changes in weight and BMI were found before and after the rTMS intervention in the active stimulation group (mean change = -2.25 kg, P < 0.01; mean change = -0.08, P < 0.001). Weight and BMI decreased significantly more in the active stimulation group compared to the sham stimulation group 4 weeks after the intervention (all P < 0.05). In the active stimulation group, immediate memory, attention, and delayed memory were significantly elevated before and after the rTMS intervention (P < 0.001). Delayed memory was more significantly elevated in the active stimulation group relative to the sham stimulation group 4 weeks after the intervention (P < 0.05). In the active stimulation group, weight change was significantly correlated with attention change and cognitive total score change (all P < 0.05). In the active stimulation group, BMI change was significantly associated with attention change and cognitive total score change (all P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that high-frequency rTMS could serve as a potential method for reducing body weight in obese patients with chronic stable SCZ."

      "abstract": "The cognitive impairment resulting from stroke is purported to be associated with impaired neuronal structure and function. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) modulates neuronal or cortical excitability and inhibits cellular apoptosis, thereby enhancing spatial learning and memory in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether Sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin receptor motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1), a pivotal Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule and its related mechanisms are involved in the ameliorating effect of TMS on cognitive function post-cerebral ischemia. We evaluated hippocampal injury in MCAO/R rats after one week of treatment with 10-Hz TMS at an early stage. The effect of SARM1 was more effectively assessed through lentivirus-mediated SARM1 overexpression. Various techniques, including FJB staining, HE staining, western blot, immunofluorescence, imunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy, were employed to investigate the molecular biological and morphological alterations of axons, myelin sheaths and apoptosis in the hippocampus. Ultimately, Morris Water Maze was employed to evaluate the spatial learning and memory capabilities of the rats. We observed that TMS significantly reduced the levels of SARM1, NF-κB, and Bax following MCAO/R, while elevating the levels of HSP70, Bcl-2, GAP-43, NF-200, BDNF, and MBP. Overexpression of SARM1 not only reversed the neuroprotective effects induced by TMS but also exacerbated spatial learning and memory impairments in rats. Our results demonstrate that TMS mitigates hippocampal cell apoptosis via the SARM1/HSP70/NF-κB signaling pathway, thus fostering the regeneration of hippocampal axons and myelin sheaths, as well as the improvement of spatial learning and memory.",

Leveraging electronic medical records (EMR), this retrospective cohort study applied supervised machine learning (ML) to sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related data to predict depressive symptom response (>50% reduction on PHQ-9) and remission (PHQ-9 < 5) following rTMS in 232 patients with TRD (mean age: 54.5, 63.4% women) treated at the University of California, San Diego Interventional Psychiatry Program between 2017 and 2023. ML models were internally validated using nested cross-validation and Shapley values were calculated to quantify contributions of each feature to response prediction. The best-fit models proved reasonably accurate at discriminating treatment responders (Area under the curve (AUC): 0.689 [0.638, 0.740], p < 0.01) and remitters (AUC 0.745 [0.692, 0.797], p < 0.01), though only the response model was well-calibrated. Both models were associated with significant net benefits, indicating their potential utility for clinical decision-making. Shapley values revealed that patients with comorbid anxiety, obesity, concurrent benzodiazepine or antipsychotic use, and more chronic TRD were less likely to respond or remit following rTMS. Patients with trauma and former tobacco users were more likely to respond. Furthermore, delivery of intermittent theta burst stimulation and more rTMS sessions were associated with superior outcomes. These findings highlight the potential of ML-guided techniques to guide clinical decision-making for rTMS treatment in patients with TRD to optimize therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dysphagia is one of the common complications of stroke. The use of high-frequency (10 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to stimulate the suprahyoid motor cortex, which has been an evidence-based treatment method for dysphagia. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a newer type of rTMS. There are few studies comparing iTBS with 10 Hz rTMS in the treatment of post-stroke dysphagia (PSD). Therefore, our study describes the rationale and design of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of iTBS versus 10 Hz rTMS on swallowing function, serum indexes and functional fMRI in patients with PSD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Fifty participants with PSD will be randomly assigned to the iTBS group (n=25) or the rTMS group (n=25). iTBS group: three 50 Hz pulses, repeated at 5 Hz, 100% intensity threshold, 600 pulses/time and sham rTMS. rTMS group: 10 Hz pulse, 100% intensity threshold, 1000 pulses/time and sham iTBS. The stimulation sites will be the suprahyoid motor cortex of affected hemisphere, once a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Swallowing function and serum indexes will be evaluated at baseline, second week of treatment, fourth week of treatment and 4 weeks after the end of treatment. The fMRI will be evaluated at baseline and in the fourth week of treatment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University (number: KY2023406). The findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2400079679.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairments are one of the most common consequences in stroke survivors. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) produces electromagnetic pulses transmitted through a coil over the individual's head. This review aims to examine the effects of rTMS on cognition in stroke survivors, identify who would be most likely to benefit from the therapy, define the optimal therapeutic parameters, and provide recommendations. \"PubMed, Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, PEDro, and Web of Science\" were searched until December 5, 2024. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 4 was used for quantitative analysis. The \"Cochrane Collaboration tool\" was employed to assess the quality of the selected studies. Thirteen studies met the eligibility criteria. In total, 608 stroke survivors (mean age 60.17 years) were involved in the present review. The meta-analysis showed a small, non-significant effect of rTMS on global cognitive function in stroke survivors (Functional independence measure-cognitive; SMD = 0.386, 95% CI: -0.331 to 1.103, p = .291), (Mini-Mental State Examination; SMD = 0.162, 95% CI: -0.405 to 0.730, p = .575), and (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; SMD = 0.204, 95% CI: -0.613 to 1.021, p = .625) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 77-85%). While some studies reported improvements in specific cognitive domains, overall findings indicate substantial variability and uncertainty. This review highlights inconclusive evidence on the effects of rTMS on various cognitive domains in patients with stroke. The frequency of rTMS and coil location are essential factors in determining outcomes. Future studies are strongly warranted."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Mental health disorders, including major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, present a significant global burden, with early onset and progression leading to substantial individual and social impacts. While pharmacotherapy remains the standard treatment, many patients experience inadequate symptom relief or intolerable side effects. In this context, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a non-invasive, well-tolerated neuromodulation technique offering an alternative treatment option. Although its clinical efficacy is well-documented, limited research exists on patient perceptions, decision-making processes and barriers to TMS utilization in private healthcare settings, particularly in Romania. This study explores patients' experiences with TMS, factors influencing their treatment choices and comparative views on its acceptability relative to pharmacological interventions. Materials and Methods: A qualitative research design was employed, using semi-structured interviews with 20 patients diagnosed with MDD or AD who had undergone TMS therapy as part of two pilot studies which were non-randomized in Romanian private practices. Data were collected via interviews and analyzed thematically to identify patterns in patient perceptions, decision-making factors and treatment experiences. Results: Participants reported predominantly positive perceptions of TMS, citing improvements in mood, anxiety reduction, and enhanced daily functioning. The most common motivations for seeking TMS included dissatisfaction with pharmacotherapy, recommendations from physicians or peers and information obtained via online sources. TMS was perceived as a safer and more tolerable alternative to medication, particularly due to its lack of systemic side effects. However, barriers such as high treatment costs, limited insurance coverage and logistical challenges in accessing TMS services were noted as significant deterrents. Conclusions: The study highlights the strong preference for TMS among patients who seek alternatives to pharmacotherapy, with key motivators including efficacy, tolerability and non-invasiveness. However, systemic barriers to access remain a critical challenge in private healthcare settings. Future research should focus on expanding accessibility, improving patient education and integrating TMS into broader mental healthcare frameworks to optimize treatment outcomes.",

However, the optimal dose parameters for TMS interventions targeting suicidal ideation in adolescents remain unknown. This exploratory study examined the impact of 1 Hz and 10 Hz TMS treatment on suicidal ideation in adolescents with major depressive disorder. Participants (N = 41) aged 12-18 years were randomized to TMS treatments with 1 Hz or 10 Hz frequency over 6 weeks and included in the exploratory analyses. The change in the intensity of suicidal ideation throughout treatment was estimated with ordinal logistic regression models with and without adjustments for the change in depressive symptom severity. The predicted odds of intensity of suicidal ideation significantly decreased over six-weeks of acute TMS treatment for both the 10 Hz TMS group (OR = 0.754, 95 % CI = 0.634 to 0.897, p = 0.0015) and the 1 Hz TMS group (OR = 0.780, 95 % CI = 0.668 to 0.909, p = 0.0016). However, after adjustment for the change in depression severity as a time-varying covariate in the ordinal logistic regression model, the magnitude of the decrease (or predicted odds) in intensity of suicidal ideation was attenuated and rendered non-significant for both the 10 Hz and 1 Hz TMS groups. TMS treatment suicidal ideation outcomes were not significantly different between the 10 Hz and 1 Hz TMS groups. Low-frequency TMS may be as effective as high-frequency TMS in treating suicidal ideation in adolescents with depression. Notably, 1 Hz TMS may have a favorable tolerability and safety profile for adolescents."

METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 272 patients with TRD treated with rTMS at a tertiary psychiatric hospital. Depression severity was assessed at baseline, end-of-treatment (V1), and one-month follow-up (V2) using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Response (≥50% MADRS reduction) and remission (MADRS ≤10) rates were calculated. Repeated measures ANOVA and logistic regression were used to examine the influence of age and treatment protocol. RESULTS: Both age groups showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms. Older adults had higher remission rates at V1 (36% vs. 23%, p = 0.033), although this difference was no longer significant at V2. No interaction between age and protocol was observed. Female sex was the only significant predictor of remission at V2 (OR = 14.25, p = 0.021). Sensitivity analyses treating age as a continuous variable yielded consistent findings. CONCLUSION: rTMS is an effective treatment for TRD in both older and younger adults. Older patients respond comparably to younger ones, challenging concerns about age-related reductions in neuromodulation efficacy. These findings support the use of rTMS in late-life depression without major protocol adjustments and underscore the need for future studies examining personalized treatment parameters and psychosocial moderators of response."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDS: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) has been widely used in the treatment of insomnia, but there is a lack of research on whether this method could enhance the cognitive flexibility(CF) of individuals with insomnia symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of rTMS on the CF of undergraduates with insomnia symptoms. METHODS: 29 participants were randomly assigned into Active group(n = 15) and Sham group(n = 14), receiving 1 Hz rTMS interventions targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 2 weeks, comprising 10 sessions (active vs sham stimulation). Sleep quality and CF were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index(ISI), Cognitive Flexibility Inventory(CFI), and the Number-Letter Task (N-L task) at baseline(T0), post-intervention(T1), and 8 weeks' follow-up(T2), and event-related potential(ERP) data during the N-L task were recorded. RESULTS: Following the intervention, compared to the Sham group, the ISI and PSQI scores in the Active group were significantly decreased, and the CFI score was significantly increased (P < 0.01); the results of the N-L task indicated that at T1, the switch cost of reaction time and accuracy for the Sham group were significantly higher than those for the Active group(P < 0.05). ERP analysis indicated that at T2, under switch conditions, the amplitude of the frontal area P2 in the Active group was significantly greater than that in the Sham group, and the beta-band ERD at parietal region in the Active group was significantly lower than that in the Sham group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: rTMS could improve sleep quality and enhance the CF of undergraduates with insomnia symptoms.

      "abstract": "Peripartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent and serious mental health disorder that is often underdiagnosed and undertreated due to limited effective and safe treatment options. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a non-invasive treatment for PPD, yet awareness among patients is low. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators to accessing mental health treatment, particularly rTMS, for PPD. We conducted 36 interviews with individuals who experienced depressive symptoms during the peripartum period and health providers, followed by a descriptive interpretive thematic analysis. Key risk factors identified include personal (i.e., age), clinical (i.e., traumatic birth), situational (i.e., COVID-19, homelessness), and social (i.e., discrimination, domestic abuse). Five themes emerged regarding barriers and facilitators: 1) the need for mom-centered care, 2) systemic challenges, 3) the importance of mental health education, 4) stigma and custody concerns, and 5) challenges in accessing care. Eighty-three percent of participants were unaware of rTMS, but following a brief description, 75% were willing to receive or refer to rTMS if it was available to them. Addressing systemic and access-related concerns is crucial to ensuring patients with PPD have access to safe, effective, and accessible treatments.",

Databases including Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Medical Database, and VIP database were searched up to 31 December 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing rTMS combined with pharmacological intervention for sleep disorders and depressive symptoms in patients with depression. Data analysis was performed using Stata software. 17 RCTs involving 1667 patients were included. Meta-analysis revealed that rTMS significantly improved sleep quality (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.12, P < 0.05) and reduced depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.73, 95% CI: -1.37 to -0.10, P < 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed that the optimal parameters for improving sleep quality were high-frequency rTMS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, high stimulation intensity, low total pulse count (< 1200 pulses), session duration ≤ 20 min daily, for 5-8 weeks. For depressive symptoms, a daily treatment duration of 21-30 min was more effective under similar parameter conditions. rTMS effectively improves sleep quality and alleviates depressive symptoms in patients with depression, showing a dose-dependent effect with stimulation parameters. However, in patients with a prolonged disease course or greater symptom severity, particularly those with vascular and other neurological comorbidities, rTMS alone may be insufficient. Integrating additional therapeutic strategies or tailoring personalised treatment protocols may be necessary to optimise clinical outcomes. Future research should further explore the synergistic potential of rTMS combined with orexin receptor antagonists (ORAs), offering a novel, multimodal approach for managing depression with comorbid insomnia.",

This study explores the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a tool for rapid screening of CI and for evaluating the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in improving brain function and clinical symptoms in CI patients. METHODS: A total of 60 participants were enrolled, including 30 healthy controls (HCs) and 30 CI patients. CI patients received a two-week intervention of 1 Hz rTMS targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Symptom severity was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Hemodynamic differences between CI patients and HCs during a verbal fluency task (VFT) were analyzed using fNIRS. RESULTS: HCs exhibited significantly lower PSQI, SAS, and SDS scores compared to CI patients (p < 0.05). During the VFT, oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) levels in the DLPFC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were significantly higher in HCs than in CI patients (p < 0.05). Following rTMS treatment, CI patients demonstrated significantly increased activation in relevant brain regions compared to pre-treatment levels. CONCLUSION: fNIRS has shown considerable potential as a valuable tool for the screening and diagnosis of CI. Compared to HCs, CI patients exhibited significantly weaker PFC responses during the VFT. rTMS treatment was found to alleviate symptoms in CI patients, likely due to its ability to enhance PFC activation."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) affects approximately 30% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), for whom effective treatment options are limited. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms in TRD. However, it remains unclear if these improvements are driven or mediated by changes in cognitive function or biological markers, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). METHODS: This study examines the effects of rTMS on depressive symptoms, cognition, and BDNF levels, as well as the potential moderating role of lifetime suicidal attempts (LSA) on cognition and the predictive value of baseline BDNF for clinical outcomes. Twenty-five TRD patients were included, with 13 in the rTMS treatment group (receiving 20 sessions of rTMS over four weeks) and 12 as control group. Depression severity, cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination, Verbal Fluency, Digit Span), and serum BDNF levels were measured pre- and post-treatment. Mixed-effects linear regression models assessed clinical and biological associations. RESULTS: rTMS significantly reduced HAM-D (p < 0.001) and CGI (p < 0.001) scores compared to controls. Cognitive performance improved significantly in MMSE (p = 0.049) and Digit Span (p = 0.04), with no significant changes in BDNF levels (p = 0.39). LSA did not moderate cognitive outcomes, and baseline BDNF did not predict clinical improvement (p = 0.68). DISCUSSION: rTMS reduced depressive symptoms in TRD patients, with modest cognitive benefits. Baseline BDNF did not predict outcomes, though the lack of significant change suggests complex neuroplastic responses. Future studies should include larger samples and refined biomarker assessments."

      "abstract": "Stroke is a significant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular condition and is among the primary causes of prolonged neurological impairment globally. Approximately 55%-75% of stroke survivors will experience some form of long-term sensorimotor impairment. Post-stroke, the upper limb typically exhibits restricted mobility, complicating daily chores for 70% of patients and impairing normal limb utilization. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a prominent non-invasive neuromodulation technique designed to enhance functional recovery post-stroke, has garnered significant attention in clinical studies. Likewise, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been extensively employed in therapeutic settings to promote neuroplasticity. However, there remain several issues with it in practical application. Recently, considerable focus has been directed toward a novel treatment known as rTMS in conjunction with obligatory motor therapy. This can circumvent the issues associated with conventional treatments and optimize the advantages of both. This article discusses the present status of clinical research with rTMS and CIMT."

In a randomized controlled trial with 88 participants, utilizing a complex WM task (ΔK = 6.41, p = 0.004) alongside functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess cognitive performance and neural correlates(neural metrics from fNIRS indicated enhanced functional connectivity [p = 0.015] and increased wavelet amplitude in task-relevant cortical regions [p = 0.001]), our results indicated that the combined intervention significantly outperformed both monostimulation and sham stimulation in improving WM capacity. A notable strength of this study is the simultaneous application of TMS and tPBM, which maximizes potential synergistic effects while addressing the physical constraints associated with traditional noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Findings underscore dual neuromodulation as a promising noninvasive intervention for MCI, offering insights into cognitive enhancement mechanisms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Technologies such as videofluoroscopy, therapy applications, and telehealth have been translated into the clinical toolkit of many speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an emerging technology that shows therapeutic promise for communication and swallowing disorders and, once suitable for clinical use, SLPs will likely be responsible for delivering this treatment. As such, it is critical that SLP opinions and attitudes towards TMS, as well as broader translation issues facing the profession, are considered early in the TMS research and translation process. AIMS: (1) To explore in-depth the determinants of SLP behaviour that could influence translation of TMS into speech-language pathology practice; and (2) to examine these behavioural determinants within the context of profession-wide research-to-practice gaps. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 SLPs, who were classified into novice, intermediate, or expert TMS knowledge/experience levels. Reflexive thematic analysis conventions were used to inductively and deductively code interview data. The refined Theoretical Domains Framework (rTDF) informed study design, analysis, interpretation, and reporting, and served as a theoretical lens through which recommendations were developed. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Four main themes were derived from interview data, representing four overarching determinants of SLP behaviour: actual knowledge/experience; perceptions of professional role and capabilities; optimism/pessimism mindset and emotions; and environmental factors. Results within each theme were categorised as TMS-specific (aim 1) or profession-wide (aim 2). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Many TMS-specific behavioural determinants could impact the translation of TMS into speech-language pathology, however these exist against the backdrop of larger, profession-wide translation issues. A taxonomy of nine recommendations for bridging technology translation gaps in speech-language pathology is provided, with a view to facilitating future implementation of TMS and other technologies. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) might one day be used as a treatment for communication and swallowing disorders, and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) will likely be responsible for delivering this treatment. Previous research has investigated SLPs' opinions and attitudes towards TMS to identify determinants of SLP behaviour that could impact translation of TMS into practice. However, more in-depth investigation is required within the context of profession-wide translation issues. What this paper adds to the existing knowledge The present study highlights behavioural determinants that could impact translation of TMS, as well as profession-wide research-to-practice gaps. We suggest important strategies and lines of enquiry to bridge translation gaps for use of technologies in speech-language pathology, which are summarised as a taxonomy of nine recommendations. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Results from this study may help SLPs to acknowledge and characterise translation issues in their own practice and across the broader profession. Our taxonomy of recommendations can be used in clinical, research, and implementation science settings to address technology translation issues in speech-language pathology, facilitating future integration of TMS and other technologies into practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the core of motor control and learning, the cerebellum is crucial for maintaining posture, regulating muscle tone, and coordinating movement. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies on the application of cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTMS) to motor dysfunction in patients with stroke. This review aims to analyze cTMS efficacy for stroke patients and further explore the specific effects of different stages of the disease, stimulation modes, stimulation intensity, and treatment duration. METHODS: Six databases were searched comprehensively-CNKI, Wanfang, Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase-to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to October 2024 that investigated the improvement of physical motor dysfunction in stroke patients using cTMS. Two researchers screened the literature, extracted data, and independently assessed the quality and risk of bias of the included studies using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool 2. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4. RESULTS: A total of 20 RCTs with 812 participants were included. Meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis revealed that cTMS significantly improved BBS (Random, MD = 5.19, 95%CI = 3.66-6.72, p < 0.00001), enhanced FMA-LE scores (Random, MD = 1.88, 95%CI = 0.76-3.01, p = 0.001), shortened the TUG (Fix, MD = -1.64, 95%CI = -2.60 to -0.68, p = 0.0008), and 10MWT durations (Fix, MD = -7.66, 95%CI = -12.33 to -2.99, p = 0.001), and increased MEP amplitudes (Fix, MD = 0.45, 95%CI = 0.04-0.87, p = 0.03). Subgroup analysis of the BBS showed that cTMS had a significant effect on patients with stroke in the subacute phase (p < 0.00001), with improvements observed using HF-rTMS (p < 0.0001), iTBS (p < 0.00001), and intensities ≤ 80%RMT (< 80% RMT, p < 0.0001; 80% RMT, p < 0.00001). cTMS consistently demonstrated superior effects compared to controls across different intervention durations (5-10 sessions, p = 0.009; 11-20 sessions, p < 0.00001; > 20 sessions, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: cTMS effectively improves motor function in patients with stroke, particularly during the subacute phase with excitatory stimulation and moderate intensities (≤ 80%RMT).

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the reversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognitive function and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The study enrolled 25 MCI participants, who underwent a 10-day of rTMS treatment and an 18-month follow-up, along with 15 healthy subjects. Participants with MCI were categorized into MCI reverters (MCI-R) and MCI maintainers (MCI-M). We assessed differences in baseline cognitive performance, functional connectivity, and changes of cognitive functions after rTMS between MCI-R and MCI-M to identify possible predictors of reversion of MCI and explore the neural modulation mechanisms. RESULTS: MCI-M exhibited more severe cognitive impairments across more domains, particularly in language function (p < 0.05). Functional connectivity was more severely damaged in MCI-M participants, notably within the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and frontoparietal network (FPN). After rTMS therapy, MCI-R participants demonstrated more significantly improved immediate and delayed recall memory scores (p < 0.05). These memory function changes and baseline functional connectivity of DMN, ECN, and FPN were predictive of the reversion of MCI. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of rTMS in memory function may promote the reversion of MCI to normal cognition, with the functional connectivity of DMN, ECN, and FPN playing a crucial important role. The severity of cognitive impairment and functional connectivity damage correlated with the likelihood of the reversion of MCI to normal cognition, underscoring the importance of early rTMS intervention for dementia prevention."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder has a long depressive episode and high risk of suicide. In clinical practice, patients often show no response to pharmacotherapy, which results in prolongation of the depressive episode. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique expected to serve as a treatment option for bipolar depression. For bipolar depression, a meta-analysis suggested that low-frequency stimulation to the right prefrontal cortex was possibly effective. However, a medium or large sample, randomized, double blind, sham controlled study has not yet been performed. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of 1-Hz rTMS to the right prefrontal cortex in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. rTMS was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare as a highly advanced medical technology on March 1, 2019. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, sham stimulation-controlled trial for bipolar depression, patients will be individually allocated to active or sham stimulation plus usual medication and followed up for 6 months. The conditions of stimulation by the Mag Pro R30 transcranial magnetic stimulation device (Magventure) will be a frequency of 1-Hz, intensity of 120% motor threshold, and duration of 1800 seconds to the right prefrontal cortex 5 days a week for 4 weeks during the acute treatment period. The primary endpoint will be a total change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score during the acute treatment period. DISCUSSION: The outcomes of this study will inform clinical practice for the treatment of bipolar depression.

The focus of this review is to provide an update on the current state of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a therapeutic intervention for SUDs and discuss neuroimaging-guided TMS practices. This review explores the neurobiology underlying SUDs, emphasizing the roles of the prefrontal cortex, striatal circuits, and dopaminergic pathways, and examines the theory that TMS modulates neurocircuitry to impact addiction-related behaviors. We discuss TMS procedural aspects and provide a comparative analysis of TMS protocols, focusing on repetitive, deep, single-pulse, paired-pulse, and a more recent approach, theta burst stimulation. We review recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to demonstrate reductions in cravings and use across SUDs as well as highlight the need for standardized protocols. We emphasize the power of combining neuroimaging techniques to show functional connectivity changes in the brain and identify potential biomarkers predictive of SUD treatment response, an unexplored area of discussion. With these topics, this review highlights the potential of TMS as a versatile and effective therapeutic modality for SUDs, especially when combined with neuroimaging. Key findings emphasize the necessity for future research to address methodological challenges, such as standardizing protocols and optimizing stimulation parameters. The integration of neuroimaging provides insights into functional connectivity changes, enabling enhanced precision and individualized treatment strategies. By validating TMS approaches and incorporating multimodal techniques, this field can advance toward a more robust clinical utility in addressing the complex neurocircuitry of addiction-related behaviors underlying SUDs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes significant motor function limitations, substantially impacting the quality of life of affected individuals and their caregivers. While the currently available pharmacological therapy with levodopa can alleviate symptoms, identifying a treatment that achieves similar results with fewer adverse effects would be highly beneficial. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is a non-invasive stimulation of brain tissue that generates a magnetic field to modulate cortical excitability. To date, it has primarily been validated for the treatment of psychiatric conditions, but it is increasingly being used in the management of movement disorders. OBJECTIVE: Although several systematic reviews with meta-analysis have been conducted on this topic, discrepancies remain in their findings. To address these inconsistencies, we conducted this overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses to synthesise the available evidence and provide a comprehensive summary that can guide clinicians in their practice. RESULTS: Evidence from 21 systematic reviews with meta-analyses, including 107 unique primary studies, suggests, with low to moderate certainty, that high-frequency stimulation of the primary and supplementary motor cortex significantly improves general motor impairment, gait, functional mobility, and balance in patients with Parkinson's disease, with minimal side effects. Other stimulation parameters, such as a higher number of sessions, a greater number of pulses per session, and the use of the F8 coil type, appear to enhance these effects. However, further research is needed to strengthen these findings. Currently, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the influence of patient characteristics on treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is efficient in frequently coexisting neurological and psychiatric disorders. This retrospective study investigated potentially additive efficacy and feasibility of multilocus rTMS in patients treated for more than 1 concurrent disorder. METHODS: Thirty-three consecutive patients underwent therapeutic rTMS with several cortical targets for more than 1 disorder. Two patients were excluded (insufficient data). The patients (19 women and 12 men, median age 49 years, range 17-75 years) had combinations of chronic pain (n = 15), depression (n = 30), tinnitus (n = 7), anxiety (n = 6), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 3), and eating disorder (n = 3). The combination of pain and depression was most frequent. E-field navigated TMS device (Nexstim Ltd, Helsinki, Finland) was used for a 10-day rTMS-trial (9 in 2 cases). Protocol and cortical target combinations varied according to indications. In addition to clinical evaluation, at least 30% decrease in severity on disorder-specific scales was response limit. All assessments were done at baseline and after 10-day treatment. RESULTS: Response rate to multilocus rTMS in at least 1 condition was 84%. A response to treatment was observed for both indications in 19 patients, for a single indication in 7 patients, and for none in 5 patients. As available (n = 20), Global Impression of Change was positive in 85% of patients, and 15% reported no change. CONCLUSIONS: Multilocus rTMS is an efficient tool for comorbid neurological and psychiatric disorders, with no serious adverse effects. Responder rate was rather high in patients with comorbidities, suggesting that rTMS efficacy may be associated with inherent patient-related factors."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebellum has been a emerging target for non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on post-stroke patients in recent years. While research is emerging on the impact of cerebellar repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on post-stroke patients, and its integrated effect remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of cerebellar rTMS on stroke rehabilitation. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases from inception to 31 March 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case studies reporting effects of cerebellar rTMS on patients with stroke. RESULTS: This review included 18 studies (n = 638 participants), consisting of 14 RCTs and 4 case reports. A total of 6 studies focused on post-stroke dysphagia, while 12 studies investigated post-stroke motor dysfunction. Comparative analysis between treatment and control groups revealed statistically significant improvements in swallowing function, as measured by the Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS) (P = 0.02), the Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) (P < 0.001), and the Standardised Swallowing Assessment (SSA) (P < 0.001). Moreover, cerebellar rTMS treatment showed significant enhancements in balance abilities and activity of daily living among stroke patients, as indicated by significant increases in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (P = 0.003) and the Barthel Index (BI) (P = 0.04) compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence suggests that cerebellar rTMS holds promise in mitigating post-stroke swallowing dysfunction and motor dysfunction. Stimulation by cerebellar rTMS appears to be an efficacious technique for enhancing stroke rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke leads to white matter damage and neurological deficits. Previous studies have revealed that high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has beneficial effects on white matter reorganization and neurological recovery after stroke. However, the characteristics of poststroke white matter repair after treatment with HF-rTMS remain unclear. Therefore, this study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the impact of HF-rTMS on white matter integrity following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in a rat model. The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and T2-weighted imaging data were used to assess neurological function and infarct size. We used a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach to analyze changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) across various white matter tracts. Furthermore, we performed Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to detect white matter and myelin damage. The results revealed that compared with the tMCAO group, the tMCAO+rTMS group presented a significant decrease in infarct size and the mNSS, as well as significantly greater FA values, mostly in the left external capsule, left internal capsule, left optic tract, left deep cerebral white matter, left stria terminalis and right external capsule. The LFB staining and electron microscopy results are consistent with the DTI results. These findings suggest that HF-rTMS contributes to the recovery of white matter integrity and neurological function. This study underscores the importance of HF-rTMS as a noninvasive intervention for enhancing poststroke neurological recovery by improving white matter integrity.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the enhancing effects of rTMS over the cerebellum on inhibitory rTMS for motor recovery in patients with subacute ischemic stroke. Methods: Twenty-three patients with subacute ischemic stroke were recruited into this single-blind randomized, controlled study with a blinded observer. The Cr-Cbll group received Cr-Cbll rTMS consisting of continuous theta burst stimulation over the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1), a shoulder mobilization exercise, and high-frequency rTMS over the contralesional cerebellum. The Cr-sham group received sham rTMS over the cerebellum instead of high-frequency rTMS. All participants received ten daily sessions for 2 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) was measured before, immediately after, and 2 months after the intervention. Results: A total of 20 participants (10 in the Cr-Cbll group and 10 in the Cr-sham group) who completed the two-week intervention were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There was no significant difference in general and clinical characteristics between the two groups at baseline. Total and upper extremity scores of FMA showed a significant interaction between time and group (p < 0.05). Each improvement of upper extremity score of FMA immediately and 2 months after the intervention was significantly higher in the Cr-Cbll group than in the Cr-sham group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results demonstrated that rTMS over the cerebellum could have additional effects on inhibitory rTMS over contralesional M1 for improving upper extremity motor function in patients with subacute ischemic stroke."

      "abstract": "Post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is a common complication of stroke, significantly impacting patient's quality of life. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an emerging potential non-invasive treatment for PSE. This review explores current evidence for rTMS in PSE, highlighting its potential benefits and limitations. Initial studies suggested that rTMS may reduce the seizure burden. Some studies observed a trend towards fewer seizures within two weeks of treatment initiation, indicating a relatively rapid response. Additionally, rTMS may be more effective when used in combination with medication, particularly for patients with specific lesion locations (frontal/temporal lobes) and seizure types (complex partial seizures). This points towards the potential of personalized treatment protocols. However, current evidence has limitations. Studies often involve small sample sizes and methodological variations, necessitating larger, well-designed trials with standardized protocols to confirm the efficacy and safety of rTMS in PSE. Future research should also focus on the optimization of treatment parameters, including stimulation frequency, duration, coil placement, and treatment course. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the persistence of treatment effects on seizure control, cognitive function, and overall patient outcomes. Refining patient selection criteria and investigating the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic effects of rTMS in PSE are also crucial areas for future exploration."

This study investigates the effects of M1 rTMS and cerebellar rTMS on motor learning in older adults. Seventy healthy older participants were randomly divided into M1, cerebellar rTMS, and sham rTMS groups. Participants completed the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT), while receiving 10 min of 10 Hz rTMS, with the sham group receiving inactive stimulation. Reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) were recorded before, immediately, and 48 h post-task. RT and ER decreased immediately after the SRTT in all groups (P < 0.001). Both intervention groups showed greater online motor learning than the sham group (P < 0.05). Additionally, both intervention groups exhibited offline motor learning and learning consolidation with more significant changes in the cerebellar-rTMS group during lasting time (P < 0.03), whereas the sham rTMS group could not maintain motor learning (P > 0.05).

      "abstract": "Objective: Irritability is a debilitating, transdiagnostic symptom in adolescents spanning internalizing and externalizing disorders, and early reduction in irritability with antidepressant treatments has been seen as a positive prognostic sign in depression recovery. There are substantial knowledge gaps regarding how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatments impact irritability. Methods: This exploratory study sought to investigate the relationship between irritability and depressive symptoms in adolescents with a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) undergoing treatment with 2 different doses of TMS. Participants aged 12-18 years (N = 41) underwent 6 weeks of treatment (30 sessions) in a double-blind, randomized trial of 1 Hz vs. 10 Hz TMS for the treatment of MDD. The clinical trial was conducted from September 24, 2018, through March 3, 2023. A linear mixed model was used to assess the change in irritability (assessed with item 8 on the Children's Depression Rating Scale Revised) throughout the treatment course, and a logistic regression was implemented to examine the relationship between early (week 4) irritability improvements and a posttreatment Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score. Results: Irritability significantly improved during the course of TMS treatments in conjunction with overall depression improvement across the 6 week trial for the 1 Hz TMS group (P = .0120, d =0.381) and for the 10 Hz TMS group (P = .0288, d = 0.331). There was a significant negative (inverse) relationship between the change in irritability symptoms and CGI-I response for the 10 Hz TMS group (δ log odds = -1.5474, SE = 0.7343, P = .0351) and for the 1 Hz TMS group (δ log odds = -1.2852, SE = 0.5656, P = .0231). Conclusion: These results suggest that irritability is an important correlate of disease severity and predictor of treatment response for MDD in adolescents, replicating similar results found in trials using antidepressant medications. Future research should focus on incorporating assessments of irritability into clinical decision-making and intervention discovery for transdiagnostic symptoms of irritability in youth and adolescents.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an established treatment for refractory major depressive disorder (MDD), but treatment outcomes vary substantially from person to person. Recent evidence suggests that incorporating neuroimaging-based targeting may help improve clinical outcomes. Here, we report the initial clinical outcomes of our open-label fMRI-personalized treatment protocol from the Queensland Neurostimulation Centre (QNC). METHODS: This open-label, nonrandomized study was conducted between November 2021 and September 2024. Participants were a referred sample aged between 19 and 84, meeting the criteria for treatment-resistant MDD (N=61). They received 20 or 30-weekday sessions of DLPFC rTMS. The stimulation site was personalized using each individual's fMRI brain connectivity data. RESULTS: The primary outcome was change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). MADRS was lower post-treatment (d=1.78, p<.001), with 52% and 33% response and remission rates observed. Likewise, anxiety scores (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) were lower post-treatment (d=1.27, p<.001), with 46% and 28% response and remission rates observed. The treatment was most effective in patients who qualified for randomized controlled trials (RCTs; N=19, MADRS response=74%, remission=53%) and least effective in patients with bipolar or neurological disorders (N=8, MADRS response=37%, remission=25%). Neurophysiologically, functional brain connectivity in the personalized DLPFC-SGC pathway was less anti-correlated post-treatment (d=0.63, p<.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide new clinical and neurophysiological evidence supporting the high effectiveness of fMRI-connectivity-guided personalized rTMS for MDD, especially in individuals without complex comorbidities. The results encourage future RCTs to assess the superiority of personalized targeting over standard TMS."

      "abstract": "The bilateral supramarginal gyri (SMGs) have been implicated in sensorimotor control of speech production, yet their precise roles and interhemispheric interactions are poorly understood. This event-related potential study employed dual-site continuous theta burst stimulation (c-TBS) over the bilateral SMGs simultaneously to investigate their functional dynamics in vocal motor control. Following unilateral and bilateral c-TBS over the SMG as well as sham stimulation, participants vocalized the vowel sounds while exposed to unexpected pitch perturbations in auditory feedback. Unilateral real c-TBS paired with contralateral sham stimulation led to reduced vocal compensation magnitudes and latencies and decreased P2 responses compared to bilateral sham stimulation, with no differences between left and right SMG stimulation. Source localization revealed that decreased P2 responses following left SMG stimulation localized to left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, SMG, middle temporal gyrus, and temporo-parietal junction, whereas such decreases following right SMG stimulation involved left-lateralized primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and middle temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that both SMGs are causally involved in vocal feedback control through distinct but interconnected networks. Surprisingly, dual-site c-TBS over the bilateral SMG did not alter vocal compensation or cortical activity, suggesting an interhemispheric balancing mechanism for fine-tuning vocal production. Our results offer novel insights into the bihemispheric coordination of auditory-vocal integration, highlighting potential treatment for speech disorders by modulating interhemispheric interactions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for depression routinely relies on the scalp-based Beam/F3 targeting method to identify stimulation targets in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC). Scalp-based targeting offers a low-cost and easily implemented method for TMS coil placement, enhancing treatment availability. However, limited anatomical and functional specificity of the Beam/F3 method may affect treatment outcomes, motivating assessment of the clinical standard. METHODS: In a naturalistic clinical trial of TMS conduced at four Veterans Affairs hospitals, the authors evaluate the Beam/F3 method using neuroimaging incorporated before TMS, after five treatment sessions, and after all thirty sessions. Personalized anatomical and electric field (E-field) models were developed to assess target location and network engagement, as well as subsequent effects on clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Anatomical models demonstrate that the Beam/F3 method produced reliable targets in the dLPFC across individuals and repeated treatment sessions. E-field models revealed that baseline anticorrelation between the stimulation center and the sgACC was associated with antidepressant symptom response after five TMS sessions (p=0.032,r2=0.100,N=46) and at the end of treatment (p=0.042,r2=0.107,N=39). Relatedly, E-field magnitude at the sgACC-anticorrelated peak in the prefrontal cortex correlated with symptom response throughout treatment (early treatment: p=0.001,r2=0.220,N=46; end of treatment: p=0.026,r2=0.127,N=39). CONCLUSIONS: This work establishes that scalp-based targeting can produce reliable targets in the dLPFC and be successfully evaluated using a combination of neuroimaging and E-field modeling in pragmatic, multisite applications. Importantly, this investigation also found that significant network effects occur early in treatment and that Beam/F3 targets can engage functional mechanisms in TMS."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Persistent headache is the most common and debilitating chronic condition after traumatic brain injury (TBI), affecting mood and reducing quality of life. The investigators examined in a community-based setting whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for management of major depression among outpatients with TBI histories was associated with improvement in the functional impact of headache (FH) and whether improvements were related to treatment at a specific site in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). METHODS: In the discovery phase (posttraumatic headache 1 [PTH-1] group, N=21), the association of rTMS treatment at DLPFC targets and improvement in headache and depression and anxiety were studied. Associations between functional connectivity of the patient-specific TMS treatment sites and changes in patients' FH were used to identify a target for simultaneous treatment of behavioral and headache symptoms. Patients in the translational phase (PTH-2 group, N=7) received TMS treatment at this target. RESULTS: The patients in the PTH-1 group had significant improvements in depression and anxiety but not FH, and more than half had a reduction in FH and reported an improvement in headache severity and duration. Increased functional connectivity between TMS sites and a subregion in the left DLPFC and bilateral precuneus was related to improved FH. Unlike the PTH-1 group, the PTH-2 group exhibited significant reductions in FH after 4 weeks of treatment and in anxiety and depression after 1-2 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: TMS treatment targeting the left DLPFC coordinate identified in this study may help improve treatment for both FH and anxiety and depression among PTH patients."

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of dual-target rTMS in treating patients with minimally conscious state (MCS). A total of 20 MCS patients were recruited and randomly assigned to either the real or sham stimulation group. Participants received 10 Hz rTMS targeting the left prefrontal and parietal cortices for 10 consecutive days. The Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and resting-state EEG were recorded, with relative power spectral density and coherence subsequently computed. Additionally, behavioral assessments were conducted over a six-month follow-up period. Our findings indicate that 10 Hz dual-target rTMS enhances brain oscillatory activity in the frontal, central, and parietal lobes. Specifically, the treatment resulted in a reduction in delta-band activity and an increase in alpha-band activity in the frontal lobes, as well as an elevation in alpha-band power in the central and parietal region. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the sham stimulation group. Meanwhile, in the real stimulation group, long-distance coherence (F3-P4) exhibited increased in alpha-band. These findings suggest that enhanced oscillatory activity and EEG functional connectivity may underlie the modulatory effects of dual-target rTMS. Additionally, a combined prefrontal and parietal cortex approach is another viable option in rTMS protocols for patients with pDOC.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, affecting tens of millions worldwide with projections indicating increasing prevalence in coming decades. Characterized by progressive cognitive decline, AD manifests with varying degrees of executive, language, and visuospatial impairments that worsen over time, eventually leading to severe psychiatric symptoms, mobility difficulties, sleep disturbances, and incontinence. While pharmacological treatments remain the primary intervention approach, their efficacy often diminishes over time and may produce significant adverse effects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, has emerged as a promising alternative or complementary therapy. This literature review examines the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of rTMS in Alzheimer's disease. Through electromagnetic induction, rTMS can selectively modulate cortical excitability, with high-frequency stimulation (≥ 5 Hz) enhancing neural excitability and low-frequency stimulation (≤ 1 Hz) producing inhibitory effects. Recent clinical evidence demonstrates that rTMS can significantly improve cognitive function, memory, language abilities, and motor performance in AD patients, particularly when administered with optimized parameters targeting key brain regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these effects include enhanced synaptic plasticity, increased expression of neurotrophic factors, modulation of neurotransmitter systems, and reduction of pathological protein aggregation. Meta-analyses indicate that high-frequency protocols (particularly 20 Hz) delivered over at least 3 weeks with a minimum of 20 sessions produce the most significant cognitive improvements, with effects potentially persisting for months post-treatment. Combined approaches integrating rTMS with cognitive training show particular promise through synergistic enhancement of neuroplasticity. Despite encouraging results, standardization of treatment protocols and larger clinical trials are needed to establish definitive guidelines and determine long-term efficacy. This review synthesizes current evidence supporting rTMS as an effective intervention for alleviating clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease while highlighting opportunities for advancing its therapeutic application.",

      "abstract": "The mechanism underlying the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) remains unclear, particularly regarding its impact on different severities of depression. From a personalized treatment perspective, evaluating functional improvements by illness severity is crucial. This study investigated changes in cerebral hemodynamics before and after six weeks of rTMS treatment in 45 patients with depression, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The aim was to assess changes in hemodynamics according to the severity of depressive symptoms, as classified by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17). Prior to treatment, patients with higher severity (HAM-D 17 score ≥ 24) exhibited significantly reduced blood flow in brain regions such as the frontopolar area, and dorsolateral and inferior prefrontal areas compared to patients with lower severity. After six weeks of rTMS treatment, a significant increase in hemodynamic response was observed in the frontopolar cortex and left lateral frontal regions. Moreover, a significant increase in hemodynamic response was noted in the frontopolar cortex in both the mild and severe groups, compared to the moderate group. Notably, patients exhibiting increased hemodynamics parameters also demonstrated significant improvements in depressive symptoms, as reflected by reductions in HAM-D scores. These findings suggest a potential correlation between rTMS-induced hemodynamic changes in the frontal region and improved treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the results imply that rTMS may promote neuroplasticity in specific brain regions, thereby contributing to the alleviation of depressive symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), prevalent among older adults, often precedes Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD), emphasizing the need for effective interventions. Early intervention in MCI is crucial, not only to alleviate symptoms but to potentially delay the progression of cognitive decline. The lack of definitive treatments for MCI has prompted the exploration into alternative non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches. Specifically, noninvasive brain stimulation using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in improving cognition in MCI and AD. OBJECTIVES: Our study will test the feasibility of using intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) technique of rTMS in MCI, pilot test the study design, and collect pilot data on the effect of iTBS over three different brain regions on working memory, new learning, and executive function in MCI. Exploratory objectives are to assess the feasibility and usefulness of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG), and sleep architecture as potential biomarkers in response to iTBS. METHODS: A pilot randomized double-blind controlled cross-over trial of iTBS on 20 MCI participants randomized to 10 days of active iTBS (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or left lateral parietal cortex) or control (vertex). After 4-6-week washout period, they cross over to the alternative treatment arm for another 10 days. Each participant will undergo a total of 20 iTBS sessions. Pre- and post-iTBS assessments include neuropsychological tests, fMRI, HD-EEG, and sleep architecture. DISCUSSION: This innovative study aims to test the feasibility of iTBS as a cognitive enhancement strategy in MCI. If our study is feasible, it could lead to a future larger trial to further test whether iTBS can modulate underlying neurobiology and offer a therapeutic avenue to remediate cognitive decline in MCI or ultimately delay progression to dementia.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a chronic functional dizziness often triggered by vestibular, psychological, or environmental factors. Current treatments, including pharmacological and cognitive therapies, show limitations. In recent years, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been explored in other neuropsychiatric disorders but has not been studied extensively for PPPD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMS of the left high-frequency dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in improving dizziness and mood disorders in patients with PPPD in a single-blind, placebo-randomized controlled trial. METHODS: This trial recruited patients from October 8, 2023, to June 30, 2024, with follow-up completed on September 30, 2024, of 80 patients screened from the second affiliated hospital of Chongqing Medical University in China. Totals of 4 patients were excluded and 66 patients were randomized. PPPD patients were randomized to receive either TMS (10 Hz, 20 min) or SHAM-TMS treatments to the left DLPFC over ten sessions within 2 weeks. Dizziness severity, anxiety, and depression quality were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 1 and 3 months. Adverse events were also monitored. RESULTS: Of 66 eligible patients [median (IQR) age, 54.5 (49.8-67.0) years; Of 42 women (63.6%)], 33 were randomized to the TMS group, and 33 were randomized to the SHAM-TMS group. After three months, a total of 52 participants (TMS group [n = 27]; SHAM-TMS group [n = 25)] completed the follow-up. At 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months post-treatment, the TMS group exhibited significant reductions in the levels of dizziness and anxiety compared to both their baseline measurements and the SHAM-TMS group at the same time points (all, p < 0.05). In the SHAM-TMS group, dizziness showed a significant improvement only at 2 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Additionally, in the TMS group, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores decreased at both 2 weeks and 1 month relative to baseline. In contrast, the SHAM-TMS group displayed no significant changes in HAMD scores during the 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: TMS targeting the DLPFC significantly alleviated symptoms of dizziness and anxiety in patients with PPPD. This non-invasive treatment may offer a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for managing PPPD symptoms. Further large-scale studies are recommended to confirm these findings.

To investigate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for (S)RSE, we performed a systematic review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cessation of (S)RSE after rTMS was extracted as the primary end point from manuscripts describing patients with (S)RSE treated with rTMS. Data relevant to epilepsy history, (S)RSE type and etiology, prior treatment for (S)RSE, prior duration of (S)RSE, rTMS parameters, number of treatment sessions, duration of rTMS protocols, latency to (S)RSE cessation, recurrence rate, adverse events, and long-term outcome were collected as secondary end points. RESULTS: We identified 33 patients; 17 of 33 had epilepsia partialis continua; 7 of 33 had new onset RSE. Data were incomplete in 3 of 33 regarding classification and etiology; 18 of 30 had focal motor status epilepticus (SE), 9 of 30 nonconvulsive SE, and 3 of 30 convulsive SE. The most frequent etiologies were cortical malformation (8/31), stroke (5/31), and genetic mutations (5/31). Median duration of (S)RSE before rTMS was 70 days (range: two-7300, interquartile range = 148, Q1 = 32, Q3 = 180). In 25 of 33 patients (75.8%), rTMS caused cessation of (S)RSE after zero to four days. (S)RSE recurred in eight of 17 patients (47%), for whom follow-up was available. Three deaths occurred from the underlying disease. CONCLUSION: rTMS caused cessation in 75.8% of patients with (S)RSE within four days, with recurrence in 47%. To determine the therapeutic potential of rTMS for patients with (S)RSE, further studies are required given the present findings stem from level IV studies and may have reporting bias."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Non-invasive brain stimulation has been suggested as an alternative/supplementary treatment for focal, refractory epilepsy. However, there are only a few studies and even fewer that directly compared transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). METHODS: We report the case of a 20-year-old female patient with persistent epileptiform discharges in the left occipital region consistent with focal status epilepticus. The patient received 20 min sessions of tDCS (2 mA) for five consecutive days, with the cathode over the left occipital region and the anode over the contralateral prefrontal lobe. After initial improvement, the patient's condition worsened again, and thus it was decided to treat her with rTMS (1 Hz, 1800 pulses), also for five consecutive days. Before and after each treatment, spike frequency was recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in spike frequency from pre- to post-tDCS treatment. Depending on the type of data analysis, there was either a near significant (p = 0.058, d = 0.51) or a significant (p < 0.001, d = 1.13) increase from pre- to post-rTMS treatment, and the patient reported a worsening of symptoms. SIGNIFICANCE: The study adds to a growing body of evidence on non-invasive brain stimulation treatments in focal refractory epilepsy. On the one hand, we corroborate its usefulness. On the other hand, we highlight that non-invasive brain stimulation might inadvertently worsen symptoms. Future research needs to determine which method, with which parameters, for which patient is beneficial (and detrimental). PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: The study details the case of a patient suffering from epilepsy, located in the occipital region of the brain, who did not respond to several antiseizure medications. We treated with both transcranial direct current stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The transcranial direct current stimulation treatment resulted in a significant decrease in EEG spikes, yet the patient's condition worsened again after 2 weeks. We therefore used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment, which, in fact, resulted in an increase in spike frequency. The results demonstrate both the potential benefits and risks of non-invasive brain stimulation as treatment in drug-resistant epilepsy."

However, the precise mechanisms and effects of rTMS on many types of cancer, including glioblastoma (GBM), remain largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-frequency rTMS on in vitro and in vivo GBM models and to elucidate an underlying biological mechanism of rTMS on GBM. In vitro and in vivo GBM models were treated with low-frequency rTMS (0.5 ​Hz, 10 ​min per day), and the effects of rTMS were assessed using various assays, including CCK-8 assay, sphere formation assay, 3D invasion assay, RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay, MRI, and IVIS. The results showed that treatment of GBM models in vitro with low-frequency rTMS significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Transcriptome array analysis revealed a substantial downregulation of FLNA and FLNC expression after low-frequency rTMS treatment. Moreover, in an in vitro GBM tumor sphere model, low-frequency rTMS suppressed the activation of EGFR and EphA2, inhibited ERK/JNK/p38 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, and induced apoptosis. Low-frequency rTMS also suppressed the invasion of GBM by downregulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. Additionally, in an in vivo GBM model, low-frequency rTMS suppressed GBM progression by downregulating FLNA and FLNC expression. The results demonstrated that low-frequency rTMS could be a potential treatment for GBM, achieved by downregulating FLNA and FLNC expression. This study sheds light on the potential for rTMS as a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma as well as other types of cancers."

RESULTS: DLPFC stimulation induced immediate cortical excitability in the frontal regions, while a continuous effect was identified in the parietal cortex for up to 60 min. Moreover, this pattern of cortical excitability effects was reliably identified across TMS-induced field potentials and oscillations. CONCLUSIONS: Single-session DLPFC stimulation induced both immediate and continuous cortical excitability effects for at least 60 min. The continuous cortical excitability change. was most prominent over the parietal cortices.

METHOD: In this study, we allocated 40 patients with PSCI who were divided into the left DLPFC group (n = 20) and the right DLPFC group (n = 20). Patients received 20HZ rTMS over the ipsilateral DLPFC respectively, for 20 consecutive days (20 min/time, 1 time/day). Cognitive performance was assessed before and after treatment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA), and the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). Furthermore, event-related potential (ERP) detection was also conducted in patients at baseline and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the global cognition, orientation, and language of patients in the left DLPFC group were significantly improved (P < 0.05). While the enhancement of visual perception and spatial perception in the right DLPFC group was significant (P < 0.05). MBI scores in both groups were increased (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups after treatment (P > 0.05).The decrease of latency in the left DLPFC group was more significant than that in the right DLPFC group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in amplitude (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results support that high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC is a more effective treatment for improving global cognition and suggest that the left and right DLPFC are associated with different cognitive functions."

      "abstract": "A growing body of evidence has shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can enhance word-retrieval abilities in chronic aphasia. However, there remains significant variability in the efficacy of combined rTMS and language treatments. This study investigated how semantic and phonological characteristics of baseline word-retrieval impairments may influence the efficacy of rTMS on long-term naming improvements following language treatment in individuals with chronic aphasia. Thirty participants with post-stroke aphasia underwent 10 sessions of 1 Hz rTMS to right pars triangularis followed by a modified constraint-induced language treatment (mCILT). Nineteen participants were randomly assigned to active rTMS and 11 participants were assigned to sham rTMS. All participants completed the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. We coded PNT errors and fit data to the semantic-phonological (or SP) computational model (Foygel & Dell, 2000) to derive semantic and phonological parameter weights. We ran linear regressions for the proportional improvement in naming, with fixed effects for interactions between rTMS, time, and baseline parameter weights. While there was no immediate effect of rTMS post-treatment, rTMS combined with mCILT improved long-term naming more than language therapy alone. Furthermore, greater baseline semantic and phonological characteristics of word-retrieval abilities were each associated with increased rTMS-induced gains in proportional naming improvements. These patterns were maintained at both 3 and 6 months post-treatment. This study is among the first in a larger sample to demonstrate that individual differences in lexical retrieval contribute to variability in sustained rTMS and aphasia treatment outcomes."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An exhaustive search was carried out across the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases to identify RCTs that assessed the effectiveness of rTMS in the treatment of lower limb motor impairment following a stroke. Meta-analysis was performed usingR statistical environment (V.4.2.2, www.r-project.org ). The review period encompassed the interval from the databases' origination through to February 18, 2024. RESULTS: Research reveals that applying rTMS to the unaffected motor cortex markedly enhances gait speed in stroke patients,exhibiting a significant effect (SMD: 1.117, 95% CI:0.40, 1.82, I2 = 0.0%). rTMS sessions comprising 1000-1500 pulses (SMD: 0.92, 95% CrI:0.63, 1.21, I2 = 42%, six studies), with a total session count ≥ 10 (SMD: 0.85, 95% CrI:0.53, 1.18, I2 = 54.1%, six studies), and high-frequency rTMS (SMD: 0.83, 95% CrI:0.34, 1.09, I2 = 46.3%, three studies) exhibit significant efficacyin improving lower limb balance and gait post-stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The research indicates that rTMS has been instrumental in enhancing the post-stroke prognosis for gait and limb balance. Nevertheless, the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS is subject to the diversity in stimulation locations and parameter settings.",

The study also examines the predictive value of these neural circuits for individual treatment responses.ResultsThe 4-week rTMS treatment significantly outperformed the 2-week course in improving cognitive function. Neural activity analysis identified the precuneus as a key region for episodic memory. Changes in brain regions, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), and motor network (MN), were associated with cognitive improvements. Baseline functional connectivity in these regions predicted changes in general cognition (r = 0.724, p < 0.001) and episodic memory (r = 0.447, p = 0.022) after rTMS.ConclusionsExtended rTMS treatment enhances cognitive performance in cognitive impairment patients, with the 4-week course showing superior effects. Reduced connectivity in the DMN following rTMS was linked to cognitive improvements. The neural network baseline can predict patients' treatment responses.",

METHODS: The BoostCPM clinical trial (ISRCTN15404076) was a randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group pilot study in patients with mild-moderate chronic pain. Participants were assigned 2:1 (active: sham) aiTBS for 4 consecutive days (totaling 36,000 pulses) at a daily dose of 9000 pulses (5 sessions of 1800 pulses). Primary outcomes included safety, tolerability, pain-related and affective outcomes, and quantitative sensory testing. RESULTS: 45 participants received active (n = 33) or sham (n = 12) aiTBS. No serious adverse events were recorded, and protocol adherence (tolerability) was 80.6 % and 100 % for active and sham. Follow-up response rate was 78.1 % and overall acceptance/satisfaction was 89 %. Pain relief was observed immediately after treatment and lasted 16 weeks with clinically meaningful reduction of pain burden, but no differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: aiTBS with rAI-connected lDLPFC targeting is a safe, well tolerated, feasible, and acceptable intervention in chronic pain patients. However, we found no additional improvements compared to sham. SIGNIFICANCE: Further studies of aiTBS and lDLPFC targeting for pain relief are warranted."

However, the neurobiological mechanisms of its antidepressant effects remain unclear. This study explores the potential impact of rTMS on brain structure in depressed patients and its link to neurotransmitter systems. METHODS: Thirty-six MDD patients were randomized to receive 5 times per week for 3 weeks of active or sham rTMS targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) within a double-blind, sham-controlled trial. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 items (HAMD-17) was used to assess depressive symptoms at baseline and the end of 1 W, 2 W and 3 W after treatment. We analyzed the differences in efficacy between the two groups of patients at different time points, and the grey matter changes of the brain before and after treatment in both groups. In addition, we analyzed the spatial correlations between abnormal grey matter and the neurotransmitter receptors and transporters map. RESULTS: Both the active and sham groups showed significant improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms following rTMS treatment, with the Active group demonstrating greater improvement. Additionally, the Active group exhibited increased grey matter volume in regions associated with the frontal-limbic network, and these changes were significantly correlated with the spatial distribution of D1 receptors. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that rTMS targeting the left DLPFC produces antidepressant effects by enhancing structural plasticity in the frontal-limbic network, and that dopamine system modulation may underlie rTMS therapeutic effects. These findings provide insight into the neurobiological basis of rTMS for depression treatment."

To clarify which cognitive domains in AD are improved by rTMS, meta-analyses were conducted on both global cognitive function and on each cognitive domain including verbal memory, processing speed, and executive function. In addition, sub-analyses of the treatment details of rTMS parameters including stimulation sites, stimulation frequency, stimulation intensity, and with/without the neuro-navigation technique and meta-regression analyses adjusting for gender, education, and the number of rTMS pulses were performed.ResultsThe results showed significant improvements in global cognitive function, while no significant findings in verbal memory, processing speed and executive function. No significant results were found in subgroup analysis or meta-regression.ConclusionsTo enrich the evidence for cognitive enhancement in AD with rTMS, the randomized controlled trials using a unified rTMS protocol with a larger sample size are warranted."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) entered clinical practice in China after 2000, first used in psychiatric surgery, and then in neurology and other disciplines. The First Hospital of Jiaxing introduced TMS in 2015. In practical applications, it has been found that different models of instruments and technical parameters can lead to differences in therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, our hospital selected the Danish TMS instrument, which ranks second in China, to test patients with schizophrenia from March 2021 to July 2021, with a focus on comparing the results at 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz. The testing time is concentrated between 8:30 to 10:30 in the morning. A contingency plan was made for the quality after inspection before testing. Two evaluators independently control the quality of the contingency plan. The data is independently saved and proofread by two evaluators. The purpose of this study is to translate the research results into clinical practice and provide reference basis. AIM: To investigate the effects of rehabilitation therapy using rTMS on the negative symptoms and event-related potential component of P300 in chronic schizophrenia. METHODS: One hundred and five patients with chronic schizophrenia were randomly allocated to three groups based on the frequency of rTMS (5, 10, or 15 Hz). The patients underwent five sessions of rTMS per week for 5 weeks. We compared the pre- and post-treatment P300 latency and scores for the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). RESULTS: A significant decrease in SANS score after rTMS was observed in the 10-Hz group (P < 0.05), which was not observed in the 5-Hz and 15-Hz groups. There was a significant increase in P300 amplitude in the 10-Hz group after rTMS treatment (P < 0.05), but there was no significant change in P300 latency (P > 0.05). The improvement of SANS score in the 10-Hz rTMS group was related to patient age and disease course. CONCLUSION: rTMS at 10 Hz improved negative symptoms and cognitive function in chronic schizophrenia; however, further studies on the mechanism of action are required to validate our observations."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can effectively treat cognitive impairment in stroke patients; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether rTMS improves cognitive function by regulating the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). METHODS: In a 4-week study, 70 patients with ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to two groups: one received rTMS (n = 35) and the other received sham-stimulation (n = 35) in addition to conventional medication and rehabilitation training. Patients in the rTMS group were treated with rTMS at 10 Hz for 20 min per session. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and response time in the n-back task were used to assess the severity of the disease. Fasting venous blood was collected in the early morning, both before and after the treatment. The peripheral blood levels of BDNF, NGF, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The levels of BDNF and NGF were higher in the rTMS group than in the sham group (p = 0.017, p = 0.008), after the rTMS treatment, and the levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were also elevated in the rTMS group (p = 0.049, p = 0.004). The changes in serum 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels after the rTMS treatment correlated with the changes in the MoCA and response time in the n-back task. There was a positive correlation between the serum 5-HT and BDNF levels (r = 0.4034). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the BDNF, NGF, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA levels were upregulated after the rTMS treatment, which likely contributed to improvements in cognitive function and quality of life in the patients with stroke.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Limited data are available to inform clinicians on how to manage concurrent substance use in the context of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depressive, obsessive-compulsive, psychotic, or trauma-related disorders. The authors convened an international panel of 24 rTMS experts, representative of different geographic regions and subspecialities, and created a consensus guideline for clinicians and researchers on approaches to concurrent substance use in patients receiving rTMS as treatment for primary psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A Delphi method survey and expert opinion elicited over consecutive rounds of surveys were used, with feedback and discussion after each round. Recommendation statements were established upon very high (≥80%) agreement. RESULTS: Three rounds of surveys and feedback were sufficient to reach a consensus for most topics; where consensus could not be reached, the panel discussed limitations in the current evidence base. Informed by a synthesis of the literature and practice-based evidence, the expert panel provides several consensus recommendations on the topics of screening, monitoring, risk assessment, and mitigation associated with various degrees of substance use, and specific considerations for alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and opioids. Instead of excluding all people who use substances, a nuanced approach should be taken based on an assessment of risk factors for clinical instability and severity of use. The most important safety risk with substance use is the presence of intoxication or withdrawal states, with the most data supporting seizure risk in unstable alcohol or nonmedical stimulant use. Although there is no evidence of reduced rTMS efficacy for a psychiatric disorder in the presence of concurrent substance use, the lack of data in this area warrants caution. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations can be readily implemented clinically and provide a framework for future research. In patients receiving rTMS for a primary psychiatric disorder, assessment and management of co-occurring substance use is complex, requiring greater attention, standardization, and further study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is challenging, and its neurological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offers a new non-invasive treatment approach. METHODS: One hundred male SD rats were grouped: intervention group (IG), model group (MG), sham group (SG), and control group (CG), to prepare the rat model of VCI. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted, and oxidative stress (OS) markers, neurotrophic factors, apoptosis factors, and the amplitude of postsynaptic potential (PSP) in the hippocampus of rats were measured. RESULTS: Post-intervention, IG's escape latency was lower than MG but higher than SG and CG. IG's hippocampal malondialdehyde (MDA) content, Bax, and Caspase-3 (Cas-3) were lower than MG but higher than SG and CG, while the tendency was opposite for Bcl-2 expression and the content of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). IG's brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) in the hippocampus were higher than MG but lower than SG and CG; The changes in the amplitude of PSP in the hippocampal region of IG at 10, 30, and 60 min were all higher than those in MG but lower than those in SG and CG (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Low-frequency rTMS visibly improved the learning and memory abilities of VCI rats and reduced OS levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease. A large number of ALS patients have cognitive impairment. In this double-blinded, randomized, and sham-controlled study, we aimed to investigate the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on ALS patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: A total of 90 ALS patients with cognitive impairment were recruited from two cohorts; 80 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 10 Hz rTMS or sham treatment on the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) for 4 consecutive weeks. The patients were assessed by ECAS and ALSFRS-R scales. The Zarit care burden scale was administered to caregivers of ALS patients. The primary outcome measured was the rate of decline in the total ECAS score between pretreatment, 6 months post-treatment, and 12 months post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included the group difference in the slope of the Zarit score, ALSFRS-R total score, and the neurofilament light chain plasma levels. RESULTS: The ECAS total score in the intention-to-treat population significantly changed from 79.74 ± 6.39 to 81.98 ± 6.51 and 79.22 ± 6.50 with rTMS intervention at the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups, respectively (p = 0.031, p = 0.042). The Zarit score also significantly decreased from 57.65 ± 3.42 to 52.24 ± 3.34 and 56.42 ± 3.41 at the 3-month and 6-month post-treatment time points, respectively (p = 0.003, p = 0.014). No significant differences were observed between the groups for other secondary endpoints. However, there was a trend of decreasing NF-L level rates in the treatment group over the first 6 months' follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: rTMS could yield short-term positive effects on the ALS patients subgroup with cognitive impairment and alleviate caregivers' burden. No improvement was observed in the severity of ALS and ALS plasma biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite affecting 2-4% of the population worldwide, fibromyalgia often remains refractory to treatment. Here we report the first international randomised double-blind, sham-controlled trial developed to assess the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as an add-on therapy for fibromyalgia. METHODS: Women aged ≥18 yr with fibromyalgia refractory to best available treatment were enrolled in Brazil, France, and Japan, and randomised to 10 Hz motor cortex (M1) rTMS, 3000 pulses day-1, or sham stimulation. This included 10 induction sessions over 2 weeks, followed by weekly maintenance (6 weeks), and fortnightly extended maintenance (8 weeks). Primary outcome was ≥50% pain reduction at week 8 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes included pain interference, mood, global impression of change, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) scores at weeks 8 and 16. RESULTS: We randomised 101 women (mean age 48 [range 25-83] yr) into active (n=52) or sham (n=49) arms. Bayesian analysis revealed a 99.4% probability of ≥50% pain reduction at week 8 in the active group vs sham (odds ratio [OR] 3.04; 95% credible interval [95% CrI] 1.26-8.06), with a number needed to treat of 4.54. Frequentist analysis confirmed that relative pain reduction was higher in the active than in the sham group (40.4% vs 18.4%, P=0.028). At week 16, this probability reduced to 34.2% (OR 0.815; 95% CrI 0.313-2.1), but the likelihood of FIQ score reduction was 79.1%. The intervention appeared safe. CONCLUSIONS: Add-on M1-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation reduced pain intensity up to 8 weeks in women with fibromyalgia. Although analgesic effects waned, functional improvements remained during extended maintenance at week 16."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are disabling and respond inadequately to antipsychotic treatment. Hypofunctioning of cortical areas such as anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in negative symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is efficacious for the negative symptoms. Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) has the benefits of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with the advantage of stimulating deeper brain targets. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the efficacy of high-frequency dTMS for improving negative symptoms in schizophrenia. METHODS: This was a sham-controlled, rater, and subject-blinded study. Forty-six patients were randomly assigned into active and sham groups. Ten sessions of high-frequency dTMS at 10 Hz were given at 100% of resting motor threshold using H7 coil over 2 weeks. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and Clinical Global Impressions were assessed at baseline, at 2 weeks, and at 4 weeks after completion of dTMS. RESULT: Forty-three patients completed the study. Although both active and sham groups shown improvement over the time, active dTMS group showed significant improvement in negative symptoms as indicated by significant improvement in the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms score as compared to sham dTMS group (P = 0.003, η2 = 0.158), further substantiated by improvement in negative subscale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (P = 0.044, η2 = 0.079). DISCUSSION: Findings from our study suggest that adjunctive high-frequency dTMS significantly improves negative symptoms and severity of illness among patients with schizophrenia. Future studies with larger sample sizes will add our knowledge in the beneficial effects of this newer modality of noninvasive brain stimulation."

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of rTMS remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of rTMS in smoking cessation and to explore the underlying neural mechanism of the treatment effect. In Experiment 1, we recruited 60 participants who smoked cigarettes and 60 healthy controls and used their baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by arterial spin labelling perfusion to determine the group-level difference in CBF. In Experiment 2, we used the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as the target for subsequent 5-day rTMS treatment at a frequency of 10 Hz with 2000 pulses to observe the impact of rTMS on CBF, Fagerström test for nicotine dependence scores and Tiffney questionnaire on smoking urges scores. In Experiment 3, we measured functional connectivity to monitor the functional changes induced by rTMS and assessed their associations with smoking cravings and nicotine dependence scores. In Experiment 1, participants who smoked cigarettes presented significantly higher CBF in the left DLPFC and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex than healthy controls. In Experiment 2, rTMS significantly decreased CBF in the DLPFC and reduced Fagerström test for nicotine dependence scores and Tiffney questionnaire on smoking urges scores. In Experiment 3, rTMS increased functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, right DLPFC, bilateral precuneus and bilateral parahippocampus in participants, who smoked cigarettes. Regional CBF is a tool to identify tobacco use disorder-related regional brain markers and targets for reducing nicotine dependence and smoking cravings through rTMS. A neural mechanism of left DLPFC rTMS may involve a reduction in CBF in the target area and an increase in functional connectivity between the target area and the DLPFC-striatal pathways."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a common condition characterized by persistent symptoms that are difficult to treat. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is considered a safe treatment option for alleviating chronic pelvic pain, but different stimulation protocols can affect pain relief outcomes. Establishing an optimal stimulation protocol can enhance the uniformity and consistency of rTMS to provide a potentially effective therapeutic intervention. This review sought to systematically review and assess the existing literature on transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients experiencing chronic pelvic pain syndrome, evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, and determine the most effective stimulation protocol. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across three databases, supplemented by manual searches. Two researchers independently reviewed and extracted relevant studies and subsequently performed a thorough analysis of all available clinical data. RESULTS: A total of eight studies were ultimately incorporated into the analysis. These comprised two randomized controlled trials, one self-controlled trial, two case reports, and three prospective studies. All studies demonstrated a notable reduction in pain scores post-treatment. CONCLUSION: rTMS has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating pain in individuals suffering from chronic pelvic pain syndrome. It is regarded as a safe intervention with minimal adverse effects. Nonetheless, the variability observed across studies hindered our ability to conclusively determine the most effective stimulation sites and parameters. Additional research is essential to reduce bias, enhance methodological rigor, and ascertain the optimal conditions and indications for brain stimulation to optimize the therapeutic effectiveness of rTMS.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Treating attention disorders is one of the hottest studies in the field of rehabilitation medicine. Stroke leads to the destruction of the functional network of the cerebral cortex and impairs the cognitive function of patients. Improvement of attention plays a pivotal role in the rehabilitation of patients who have had a stroke. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has achieved relatively positive efficacy in rehabilitation applications for patients who have had a stroke; however, its optimal parameters and mechanism of action regarding poststroke attention deficits are still elusive. Therefore, this will be an in-depth study exploring the mechanisms of high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation on cerebral functional connectivity in patients with poststroke attentional dysfunction. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single-centre randomised controlled trial will involve 120 patients who have had a stroke. They will be randomly allocated to either a high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation group or a control group (sham stimulation group). The intervention will take place 5 days a week for 2 weeks. The primary outcome will be a comparison between and within the two groups from baseline to 2 weeks before and after the intervention, and will be based on quantitative electroencephalography to explore the connectivity of brain networks and to assess the efficacy of high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation on attentional functioning after stroke. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging, a range of neuropsychological scales, activities of daily living, motor function scores and biological indicators will be used as secondary outcome indicators. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University (NO. KYLL-2023-264 and NO.KYXZ-2024-005).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition with limited treatment options. Standard transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has shown moderate efficacy but requires 6-8 weeks of daily sessions. This review evaluates the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of accelerated TMS (aTMS) protocols for faster treatment response. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aTMS to placebo or once-daily TMS, conducting a meta-analysis of clinical and tolerability outcomes. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach were used to evaluate the quality and strength of evidence. RESULTS: Of 97 screened records, 7 RCTs were included in the review. Six were analyzed quantitatively, showing that aTMS significantly reduced OCD symptoms (SMD 0.63), depressive symptoms (SMD 0.52), and increased response rate (OR 4.28) compared to sham aTMS. Adverse effects were higher in the aTMS group (OR 5.16), though mild, and dropout rates were similar (OR 0.74). At follow-ups, aTMS sustained significant reductions in depressive symptoms (SMD 0.74), but not in OCD or anxiety symptoms. On risk of bias assessment there were \"some concerns\" for all included studies. GRADE assessment showed moderate certainty for the primary outcome. CONCLUSION: Accelerated TMS offers promising, faster treatment for OCD and significantly reduces depressive symptoms, though it has no effect on anxiety. Further studies should explore optimal protocols and long-term effects.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Brain network dysfunction, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), is an increasingly apparent contributor to the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can target key DMN hubs, maintain signaling function, and delay or improve clinical outcomes in AD. Here, we present the rationale and design of a study using off-the-shelf equipment and the latest clinical evidence to expand on prior rTMS work and reduce participant burden in the process. METHODS: We will conduct a two-stage trial of large-coil rTMS targeting the precuneus (a key hub in the DMN affected by AD) in 54 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Clinical Syndrome focused primarily on determining tolerability and feasibility and secondarily focused on determining short-term efficacy for memory. The first stage will involve 5 to 10 participants receiving open-label active treatment to refine the protocol. The following second stage will consist of a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial to study feasibility and tolerability while exploring target engagement and short-term efficacy for memory. Participants will undergo 16 total rTMS brain stimulation sessions over the course of 5 weeks. A full course of open-label active treatment will be offered as an extension to the sham group after unblinding. Outcomes will focus on completion rates and adverse events to demonstrate feasibility and tolerability. Further exploratory outcomes will include neuropsychological assessments, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers to demonstrate the feasibility of collection and explore preliminary changes in these measures. RESULTS: We anticipate this treatment is feasible and tolerable and may show evidence of target engagement and clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: Should we achieve expected positive outcomes in feasibility and tolerability, this will justify future work focusing on clear demonstrations of clinical efficacy and biomarker engagement, as well as enhancement of generalizability and scalability. HIGHLIGHTS: Induction-to-maintenance repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though recent methods require intensive personalization.We propose here a trial design of precuneus rTMS in mild-to-early-moderate AD dementia using exclusively off-the-shelf equipment and protocol modifications to reduce participant burden.Our two novel modifications from prior work are (1) using a larger rTMS coil, and (2) consolidating the induction phase of treatment.This trial focuses primarily on tolerability and feasibility while exploring clinical measures of efficacy and biomarkers of target engagement.Our trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06597942."

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cerebellar repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and cerebellar Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) in treating ET. METHODS: We searched through June 14, 2024, four databases (Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL) to identify clinical trials investigating cerebellar rTMS or TBS in ET patients. Eligibility criteria included clinical trials reporting on safety and efficacy outcomes. Six reviewers screened and extracted data independently, resolving conflicts through consensus. Risk of bias was assessed. Statistical analyses involved pooling continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Out of 201 screened studies, nine studies were included, with a total of 261 participants (149 received rTMS, 112 were in control groups). The meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between rTMS and sham groups for Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) subscores A (MD: -3.03, 95% CI: [-7.66, 1.60], P = 0.20), B (MD: -2.74, 95% CI: [-8.09, 2.61], P = 0.32), C (MD: -1.57, 95% CI: [-5.12, 1.97], P = 0.38), and FTM-Total (MD: -8.12, 95% CI: [-20.47, 4.23], P = 0.20). Sensitivity analysis confirmed these results. Adverse events were minimal: headaches (1/44 rTMS, 2/19 sham), dizziness (1/44 rTMS, 0/19 sham), and no reported seizures or syncope. CONCLUSION: While individual studies noted significant FTM score improvements post-rTMS treatment, the pooled analysis found no significant differences versus sham. Further research with standardized protocols and larger samples is required to optimize rTMS use for ET."

We retrospectively reviewed 86 patients with TRD who received 10 Hz rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at Gazi University between June 2017 and June 2023. Inflammatory markers, including neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), were evaluated. Treatment response was assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with a ≥50% reduction in MADRS score and a score ≤8 at the end of treatment considered as a positive response. Patients divided in to two groups accoording to rTMS response. 53 patients were responders and 33 patients were non-responders. Significant differences in inflammatory parameters were observed, with non-responders showing higher NLR (p=0.001), PLR (p=0.008), and SII (p=0.002) values. Logistic regression analysis revealed that higher NLR was significantly associated with a poorer response to rTMS (OR=0.373, p=0.022). Additionally, early improvement in MADRS score in the first week predicted overall treatment outcome (OR=1.070, p<0.001). Our findings suggest that systemic inflammation plays a role in TRD and that higher pre-treatment NLR is associated with a poorer response to rTMS. Largerscale studies are needed to further understand the mechanisms and improve treatment strategies for TRD patients."

While TMS has been in clinical use for decades, and continues to be a rapidly expanding therapeutic modality, there are still many unknowns regarding how stimulation parameters may affect treatment efficacy and how they may be optimized. One key parameter that is readily accessible is coil orientation and its effects on TMS stimulation threshold. In this work, a multi-scale modeling approach addressed the effects of coil orientation on the TMS stimulation threshold for neuronal activation with several TMS coil current pulse shapes and widths. The modeling tool that was used incorporated an anatomically realistic macro scale model of the human brain cortex, and a micro scale neuronal model based on a representative layer 5 pyramidal brain cell. Simulations were performed for the left primary motor cortical area. Coil orientations associated with a minimum stimulation threshold for various current pulses were identified and then validated using data collected and published by another research team. This multi-scale modeling approach is versatile and can potentially be used for various current pulses and TMS coil locations to predict and map optimum TMS coil orientations for a wide range of treatment applications.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and effective therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A crucial next step in improving rTMS therapy is to identify response predictors to inform patient selection criteria. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exerts influence over TRD treatment modalities. BDNF polymorphism, Val66Met, has shown altered cortical plasticity after single-session rTMS in healthy subjects and clinical response in noninvasive brain stimulation methods in major depressive disorder, stroke, Alzheimer's, and cerebral palsy. We sought to evaluate the effect of this BDNF polymorphism on clinical response in a standard course of rTMS therapy for TRD. METHODS: In this naturalistic study, 75 patients with TRD completed a standard course of rTMS with weekly clinical assessments via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR). BDNF polymorphisms were retrospectively compared in respect to treatment response and remission, baseline and final scores, percent change scores, and scores across the 6-week treatment course. RESULTS: As expected, rTMS significantly decreased depressive symptoms as measured by IDS-SR scores. No difference was found in baseline, final, or percent change IDS-SR scores between polymorphism types. There was no difference between polymorphisms in IDS-SR scores across the treatment course. Response and remission rates did not differ between genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous research highlighting differential response between BDNF polymorphisms to motor plasticity and clinical rTMS outcomes, our data suggest that BDNF polymorphism status may not influence the response to a standard course of 10-Hz rTMS for major depressive disorder. Differences in TMS protocol, target, or BDNF serum levels may underlie our results."

Fifteen post-stroke patients and fifteen healthy individuals were enrolled. Coupling function analysis was performed to evaluate the effective connectivity inflow, outflow, and the dominant information flow (DIF) during standalone BAT and combined rTMS-BAT therapy. Significant task-related alterations were observed in the ipsilesional supplementary motor area and occipital lobe (OL) of stroke patients undergoing rTMS-BAT. During BAT, stroke patients exhibited more pronounced DIF from the OL to motor areas compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, in the rTMS-BAT condition, patients demonstrated enhanced DIF from the ipsilesional OL and contralesional prefrontal cortex to ipsilesional motor areas. These findings suggested a potential synergistic effect on cortical reorganization through the sequential combination of task-related training and TMS in chronic stroke patients, offering insights into rehabilitation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of impairment, with 70% of survivors experiencing upper limb motor deficits. While transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used in rehabilitation, the impact of impairment severity on treatment outcomes remains unclear. This study evaluated TMS effectiveness in post-stroke motor impairment and explored its neural mechanisms. Fifty-five stroke patients were divided into TMS (n =27) and control (n =28) groups. The TMS group received two weeks of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), while controls received sham stimulation. Patients were stratified into mild/moderate (Fugl-Meyer Assessment [FMA] ) and severe (FMA <30) impairment subgroups. Motor function and electroencephalography (EEG) metrics were assessed before and after treatment. Overall FMA improvement showed no difference between groups, but the TMS-mild/moderate impairment group demonstrated significantly greater improvement compared to others. This group exhibited higher global and local alpha band power and global alpha efficiency. FMA improvement positively correlated with local alpha power changes. TMS of ipsilesional M1 improves motor function in mild/moderate impairments but shows limited efficacy in severe cases. EEG suggests TMS promotes recovery by modulating alpha activity and enhancing network efficiency. These findings support stratified treatment approaches and highlight the need for alternative interventions in severe impairment.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive control dysregulation is nearly universal across disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Achieving comparable response rates to medication, the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) mechanism and its effect on cognitive control have not been well understood yet. This paper investigates the predictive capability of the clinical response to TMS treatment using 34 cognitive variables measured from TMS treatment of 22 MDD subjects over an eight-week period. We employ a novel brain-inspired computing paradigm, hyperdimensional computing (HDC), to classify the effectiveness of TMS using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). Four performance metrics-accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC-are used, with AUC being the primary metric. Experimental results reveal that: i). Although SVM outperforms HDC in terms of accuracy, HDC achieves an AUC of 0.82, surpassing SVM by 0.07. ii). The optimal performance for both classifiers is obtained with feature selection using SelectKBest. iii) Among the top features selected by SelectKBest for the two classifiers, ws_MedRT (median rate for the Websurf task) shows a more distinguishable distribution between clinical responses (\"1\") and no clinical responses (\"0\"). In conclusion, these results highlight the potential of HDC for predicting clinical responses to TMS and underscore the importance of feature selection in improving classification performance."

      "abstract": "To optimize the antidepressant efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), it is important to examine the impact of brain state during therapeutic rTMS. Evidence suggests that brain state can modulate the brain's response to stimulation, potentially diminishing antidepressant efficacy if left uncontrolled or enhancing it with inexpensive psychological or other non-pharmacological methods. Thus, we conducted a PRISMA-ScR-based scoping review to pool studies administering rTMS with psychological and other non-pharmacological methods. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 10 July 2024. Inclusion criteria: neuropsychiatric patients underwent rTMS; studies assessed depressive symptom severity; non-pharmacological tasks or interventions were administered during rTMS, or did not include a wash-out period. Of 8,442 studies, 20 combined rTMS with aerobic exercise, bright light therapy, cognitive training or reactivation, psychotherapy, sleep deprivation, or a psychophysical task. Meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted based on change scores on standardized scales. The effect size was large and therapeutic for uncontrolled pretest-posttest comparisons (17 studies, Hedges' g = -1.91, (standard error) SE = 0.45, 95% (confidence interval) CI = -2.80 to -1.03, p < 0.01); medium when studies compared active combinations with sham rTMS plus active non-pharmacological methods (8 studies, g = -0.55, SE = 0.14, 95% CI = -0.82 to -0.28, p < 0.01); and non-significant when active combinations were compared with active rTMS plus sham psychological methods (4 studies, p = 0.96). Attempts to administer rTMS with non-pharmacological methods show promise but have not yet outperformed rTMS alone.",

In particular, we aim to determine whether rTMS influences OA differently in the forearm region, corresponding to the stimulated cortical area, compared to the trigeminal region. Twenty-two healthy volunteers underwent three experimental sessions: a baseline session without stimulation, an active rTMS session, and a sham rTMS session. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) paradigms, including warm and cold detection thresholds, heat pain threshold corresponding to a visual analogue scale (VAS) score of approximately 50-60 out of 100 (Pain50-60), and constant and offset trials, were assessed in both the forearm and trigeminal regions. The results revealed that active rTMS significantly enhanced the OA phenomenon in the forearm during the late phase, while no significant effects were observed in the trigeminal region. These findings suggest that rTMS may modulate central pain mechanisms in a body region-specific manner, potentially linked to the somatotopic organization of M1. This study points to possible mechanisms of action of rTMS for pain relief, highlighting the importance of region-specific effects in chronic pain treatment. Further research is needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms and clinical applicability of rTMS in patients with chronic pain conditions, especially when OA is compromised."

The effectiveness of these treatments depends on accurate and sensitive diagnostic methods. This exploratory pilot study explores the use of eye tracking and compares it to neuropsychological tests on patients treated with deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS). Methods: We used the HTC Vive Pro Eye VR headset with Tobii eye tracker to measure eye movements in 10 Parkinson syndrome patients while viewing three 360-degree scenes. Eye movements were recorded pre- and post-dTMS, focusing on Fixation Duration, Longest Fixation Period, Saccade Rate, and Total Fixations. Neuropsychological assessments (MoCA, TUG, BDI) were conducted before and after stimulation. dTMS was performed using the Brainsway device with the H5 helmet, targeting the motor cortex (1 Hz) and the prefrontal cortex (10 Hz) for 7-12 sessions. Results: ROC analysis indicated a moderate ability to differentiate between states using eye movement parameters. Significant correlations were found between changes in the longest fixation period and MoCA scores (r = 0.65, p = 0.025), and between fixation durations and BDI scores (r = -0.55, p = 0.043). Paired t-tests showed no significant differences in eye movement parameters, but BDI scores significantly reduced post-dTMS (t(5) = 2.57, p = 0.049). Conclusions: Eye-tracking parameters, particularly the Longest Fixation Duration and Saccade Rate, could serve as sensitive and feasible biomarkers for cognitive changes in Parkinson's Syndrome, offering a quick alternative to traditional methods. Traditional neuropsychological tests showed a significant improvement in depressive symptoms after dTMS. Further research with larger sample sizes is necessary to validate these findings and explore the diagnostic utility of eye tracking."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric condition with a lifetime prevalence of 2-3%. It significantly burdens quality of life and is associated with substantial economic and disease burdens. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and high-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered the first-line treatments for OCD. Approximately two-thirds of patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) exhibit inadequate responses to current standard therapies, thus lacking adequate therapy, resulting in a loss of quality of life and huge economic burdens. Repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, safe, and well-tolerated intervention that modulates prefrontal cortical circuits involved in OCD. A previous systematic review explored the therapeutic effects of rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) area in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. It showed that the application of high-frequency and low-frequency (LF) rTMS to the dlPFC region yielded controversial post-treatment Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) findings due to factors such as small sample sizes, short-term study durations, and variations in rTMS protocols. OBJECTIVES: Thus, we propose a theoretical protocol based on previous findings to assess better the effect of LF rTMS for treatment-resistant OCD patients. METHODS: We will recruit patients with moderate to severe OCD and limited response to previous treatments from in- and outpatient clinics. We will use fMRI for precious localization of the right dlPFC and application of 1 Hz stimulation of in total 2000 pulses with three times 40 s inter-train intervals 5 days a week, in 6 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome will be the mean reduction in Y-BOCS at the end of this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights rTMS's potential to reform OCD treatment, accentuate safety, accessibility, clinical integration, and future research foundations."

Further evidence suggests that pairing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with intensive speech therapy might augment outcomes. This sham-controlled randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of 1-Hz rTMS over the right pars triangularis combined with multimodality aphasia therapy (M-MAT) in chronic poststroke aphasia. METHODS: A parallel-group, double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted between April 2021 and May 2023 at an outpatient neurorehabilitation clinic. Individuals with chronic nonfluent aphasia after left middle cerebral artery stroke (>6 months from stroke) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either rTMS or sham stimulation combined with 35 hours of M-MAT over 10 days. The primary outcome was the Western Aphasia Battery aphasia quotient (WAB-AQ) measured at 3 weeks and 15 weeks. Intention-to-treat analysis examined treatment effects over time using linear mixed models. RESULTS: A total of 44 participants were randomized. Forty-three (mean [SD] age, 63.4 [12.3] years; 14 women [32.6%]) completed the intervention. Overall, WAB-AQ scores improved from baseline to 15 weeks regardless of rTMS allocation (mean difference 5.33, 95% CI 2.9-7.8, p < 0.001). We observed a significant group-by-time interaction (β = 0.31, p = 0.024), suggesting that those who received rTMS combined with M-MAT improved more over time than those who received sham. At 15 weeks, the rTMS group demonstrated significantly less word-finding difficulties and more complete and longer sentences with fewer pauses compared with sham as indicated by higher WAB-AQ scores (mean difference 4.1 points, 95% CI 0.6-7.6, p = 0.022). The change from baseline at 15 weeks was greater in the rTMS group (7.6 points, 95% CI 4.1-11.1) compared with sham (3.0 points, 95% CI -0.3 to 5.2; mean difference 4.6 points, 95% CI 0.6-8.6, p = 0.024). DISCUSSION: Intensive administration of M-MAT alone improves speech production in patients with chronic poststroke aphasia. Combining 1-Hz rTMS with M-MAT is associated with supplemental improvements in aphasia severity at follow-up. rTMS is a promising candidate as an adjuvant therapy to M-MAT. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04102228. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that in patients with aphasia 6 or more months after a stroke, 1-Hz rTMS combined with intensive M-MAT improves WAB-AQ more than sham stimulation plus M-MAT.",

Due to the different patterns of brain damage in each aphasia variant, we hypothesized that patients with non-fluent and semantic variants would show a differential response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the clinical responses after a single session of repetitive TMS in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC). METHODOLOGY: Twenty patients with PPA (14 with non-fluent and 6 with semantic variants) were assessed before and after repetitive TMS over the IFG, DLPC, and vertex with several language tasks, connected speech, and a subjective impression of change scale. RESULTS: IFG stimulation was associated with an improvement in words per minute and the subjective assessment in the non-fluent variant, but no effects were found in the semantic variant. DLPC stimulation was associated with an improvement in words per minute, repetition, and naming latency in the non-fluent variant, and in naming and subjective impression of change in the semantic variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a differential effect of one session of brain stimulation over the IFG and DLPC in patients with non-fluent and semantic PPA variants. These findings suggest that the selection of the target of stimulation may be relevant for the success of brain stimulation and favor the use of DLPC over the IFG."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the safety and effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in treating motor dysfunction in stroke patients. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in five online databases, namely, Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus, from their inception to July 29, 2024. Studies meeting the predetermined inclusion criteria were included. The data were analyzed using RevMan 5.4.1 software and Stata 15.0. The subgroup analysis was conducted based on various disease stages and intervention frequencies. The overall effects were estimated using either the fixed effects model or the random effects model, with standardized mean differences (SMDs). The level of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. RESULTS: A total of 70 studies encompassing 2951 stroke survivors were included. The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that the application of 1 Hz rTMS over the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) significantly improved motor function during both the early stage (< 1 month) with moderate effect size (n = 443, SMD = 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.63, P < 0.00001, I2 = 47%, fixed-effect model) and recovery period (1-6 months) with moderate effect size (n = 233, SMD = 0.61, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.87, P < 0.0001, I2 = 33%, fixed-effect model). In the context of activities of daily living (ADLs), the application of 1 Hz rTMS over the contralesional M1 can lead to improvements in ADLs among individuals in the early stages of stroke with moderate effect size (n = 343, SMD = 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.89, I2 = 79%, P < 0.00001, fixed-effect model). However, evidence to support that 1 Hz rTMS over contralesional M1 can improve motor dysfunction in the chronic phase of stroke (> 6 months) is insufficient. CONCLUSION: Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that 1 Hz rTMS over the contralesional M1 may enhance motor function and independence in ADL during the early stages of stroke and the recovery period (within 6 months) with moderate effect. Nonetheless, as for the efficacy of 3, 5, 10, and 20 Hz rTMS in the treatment of motor dysfunction after stroke, it needs to be further determined. It is important to interpret these findings with caution in clinical practice due to the small sample sizes and low quality of the studies reviewed.

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect on rTMS to improve sleep quality in patients with more than mild depressive mood up to September 2023 were searched. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 and Stata 17.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies, which involved 548 patients, were included. After rTMS treatment, the effect on sleep quality improvement in patients with more than mild depressive mood was better in the experimental group than in the control group [I 2 = 53%, mean difference (MD) = -2.27, 95%CI = -2.97 to -1.57, p < 0.00001]. The results of the subgroup analyses showed that, in terms of stimulation frequency, compared with the 5-Hz and 10-Hz groups, the treatment effect of the 1-Hz group was better (I 2 = 32%, MD = -2.69, 95%CI = -3.78 to -1.60, p < 0.00001). In terms of treatment duration, compared with the 2-week and 4-week groups, the group with more than 4 weeks of treatment had better treatment outcomes (I 2 = 0%, MD = -2.81, 95%CI = -3.22 to -2.40, p < 0.00001). In terms of whether combination therapy was used or not, compared with the combination therapy group (I 2 = 29%, MD = -1.39, 95%CI = -2.30 to -0.48, p = 0.003), the non-combination therapy group had a better treatment effect (I 2 = 0%, MD = -2.93, 95%CI = -3.36 to -2.50, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: rTMS significantly improves sleep quality in patients with more than mild depression. Subgroup analyses showed that the group using the 1-Hz stimulation frequency, the group with more than 4 weeks of treatment time, and the group with rTMS alone had better efficacy in treating the sleep quality of patients with more than mild depressive mood using rTMS, with the use of combination treatment or not being the main source of heterogeneity.

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in English and Chinese databases, including Embase, Cochrane, Medline, PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and VIP Database, for relevant literature on rTMS treatment for dysarthria in PD patients. The search timeframe was from the inception of each database to October 2023. Literature was screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two researchers extracted information on study subjects, age, intervention methods, intervention duration, intervention frequency, evaluation indicators, and intervention results from the included literature. The modified Jadad scale was used to evaluate the quality of the literature. RESULTS: A total of seven studies were included, mainly focusing on the frequency, duration, and stimulation site of rTMS for dysarthria in PD patients. Six studies indicated that rTMS treatment improved dysarthria in PD patients. CONCLUSION: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a positive effect on improving dysarthria in PD patients, but further research is needed to determine its efficacy."

METHODS: We reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rTMS and TBS in managing TRD. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies published up to July 31, 2024. Data from these studies were analyzed using statistical software. RESULTS: Five RCTs involving 1,196 patients were included, with 553 receiving rTMS and 663 receiving TBS. The analysis found no significant differences between rTMS and TBS in reducing depression [SMD = -0.07, 95% CI (-0.19, 0.04)] or anxiety [SMD = -0.02, 95% CI (-0.15, 0.11)], nor in side effects like headaches [OR = 1.00, 95% CI (0.72, 1.40)], nausea [OR = 1.42, 95% CI (0.79, 2.54)], or fatigue [OR = 0.87, 95% CI (0.46, 1.64)]. CONCLUSIONS: Both rTMS and TBS are similarly effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, with comparable side effect profiles. However, TBS is more time-efficient, with sessions lasting only 192 seconds, making it a cost-effective option for patients. These findings support TBS as a practical treatment choice for TRD."

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly heterogeneous in response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and identifying predictive biomarkers is essential for personalized treatment. However, most prior research studies have used either electroencephalography (EEG) or clinical features, lack interpretability, or have small sample sizes. This study included 74 patients with MDD who responded (responders) and 43 patients with MDD who did not respond (nonresponders) to rTMS. Eight baseline EEG metrics and clinical features were sent to 7 machine learning models to classify responders and nonresponders. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was used to interpret feature contributions. Combining phase locking value and clinical features with support vector machine achieved optimal classification performance (accuracy = 97.33%). SHAP revealed that delta and beta band functional connectivity (F3-P7, F3-P4, P3-P8, T7-Cz) significantly influenced predictions and differed between groups. This study developed an explainable predictive framework to predict rTMS response in MDD, enhancing the accuracy of rTMS response prediction and supporting personalized treatment in MDD."

Many studies have personalized the stimulation parameters of rTMS (e.g., location and intensity of stimulation) according to the anatomical and functional structure of the brain. In addition to these parameters, the internal states of the individual, such as circadian rhythm, behavior/cognition, neural oscillation, and neuroplasticity, also contribute to the variation in rTMS effects. In this review, we summarize the current literature on the interaction between rTMS and internal states. We propose two possible methods, multimodal treatment, and adaptive closed-loop treatment, to integrate patients' internal states to achieve better rTMS treatment for depression.",

We developed a novel mouse model of rTMS with superior clinical face validity and investigated the neural mechanism by which accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS) - the first rapid-acting rTMS antidepressant protocol - reversed chronic stress-induced behavioral deficits. Using fiber photometry, we showed that aiTBS drives distinct patterns of neural activity in intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) projecting neurons in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). However, only IT neurons exhibited persistently increased activity during both aiTBS and subsequent depression-related behaviors. Similarly, aiTBS reversed stress-related loss of dendritic spines on IT, but not PT neurons, further demonstrating cell type-specific effects of stimulation. Finally, chemogenetic inhibition of dmPFC IT neurons during rTMS blocked the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of aiTBS. Thus, we demonstrate a prefrontal mechanism linking rapid aiTBS-driven therapeutic effects to cell type-specific circuit plasticity."

      "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive tool that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific regions within the brain, has emerged as a versatile treatment modality in both research and clinical settings. While its utilization in psychiatry for treatment-resistant depression is well established, TMS is increasingly gaining traction for its use in diverse neurological conditions, including idiopathic facial nerve palsy, post-stroke rehabilitation, autism spectrum disorder, and hereditary ataxia. Through its ability to trigger neuronal plasticity and potentiate synaptic transmission, it is able to provide significant therapeutic potential. This paper seeks to explore and add to the rising research in treating idiopathic facial nerve palsy with the use of peripheral TMS. A 26-year-old woman with no prior history of facial palsy or related conditions presented with acute-onset left-sided facial paralysis upon awakening, following a strenuous hiking trip the previous day. Based on the modified House-Brackmann scale, she was determined to have grade V facial paralysis (severe facial weakness with barely perceptible motion). After 10 treatments over the course of two weeks, the patient's facial paralysis improved to grade III (obvious, moderate facial weakness, complete eye closure with maximal effort, and good forehead movement). At one-week post-TMS treatment, the patient reported full recovery to all facial expressions and no adverse effects were noted. This case report aims to show the effectiveness of utilizing TMS as a treatment option for idiopathic facial nerve palsy."

      "abstract": "This is the first case series that demonstrates the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of musical obsessions or stuck song syndrome (SSS), following a systematic review that identified existing treatments. SSS can occur independently, but in literature it is commonly reported as an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) symptom. Most people are familiar with earworms, experienced by up to 98% of the western population. Earworms can become severe leading to the SSS diagnosis. SSS is a distressing repetition of involuntary tunes persisting in one's mind. According to literature, SSS has often been treated using antidepressants which are used to treat MDD and OCD. As TMS has shown a positive therapeutic effect for psychiatric disorders particularly MDD and OCD, we hypothesized that TMS could be an effective treatment that reduces symptoms of patients with SSS. We present two cases of TMS treatment contributing to a reduction in symptoms of SSS. We also aim to provide a systematic review of cases where SSS has been described and compare the pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatments used with our novel TMS interventions for SSS. This report highlights some limitations, including patient's psychiatric comorbidities and treatment protocol changes, which affect the findings generalizability. Despite these limitations, TMS appears promising as a treatment for SSS due to the observed effectiveness in reducing SSS symptoms and minimal side effects especially in medication-resistant cases."
