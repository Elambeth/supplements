      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health challenge, significantly contributing to morbidity and mortality due to its strong association with cardiovascular complications, metabolic imbalances, and reduced quality of life. Among the various interventions for CKD management, nutrition therapy plays a critical role in slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes. The Plant-Dominant Low-Protein Diet (PLADO) has emerged as a promising dietary strategy that prioritizes plant-based protein sources while restricting overall protein intake, offering potential renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic benefits. This review evaluates current evidence on the efficacy of PLADO in CKD management, analyzing its impact on renal function, cardiovascular health, and systemic inflammation. Key findings suggest that PLADO can delay CKD progression, reduce dialysis dependence, and mitigate cardiovascular risks through lower dietary acid load, increased fiber intake, and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, PLADO has been shown to support gut microbiota diversity and reduce uremic toxin production, offering metabolic advantages beyond kidney health. While PLADO appears nutritionally adequate, concerns remain regarding protein sufficiency, potassium management, and long-term adherence. Its successful implementation requires tailored meal planning, patient education, and regular clinical monitoring to optimize outcomes and mitigate potential risks. This review highlights the importance of integrating PLADO into CKD management as a holistic, patient-centered dietary approach, particularly in regions like Cyprus, where no studies have evaluated its applicability. By synthesizing existing research, this review provides insights for clinicians, dietitians, and researchers to further explore long-term outcomes, adherence strategies, and feasibility across diverse healthcare settings. Future studies should focus on large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to establish PLADO's role in CKD dietary guidelines and clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are at risk of protein malnutrition due to increased protein loss or reduced dietary intake. The consequences of protein malnutrition on intestinal epithelial metabolism and disease progression remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: Given the critical role of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as an amino acid sensor and a key regulator of intestinal epithelial metabolism and homeostasis, along with the well-established influence of diet on the gut microbiota and IBD, we focused on accessing the role of dietary protein in modulating intestinal epithelial mTORC1, determine the contributions of specific amino acids such as leucine and arginine, and examine the interplay between protein malnutrition and gut microbiota driving IBD. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were assigned to a control (20% protein, n = 6), a low protein (4% protein, n = 7), or diets selectively deficient in leucine, arginine, and other essential amino acids (n = 5-6). Colitis was induced by administering 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 6 d. Intestinal epithelial mTORC1 activity was assessed by immunoblotting. Gut microbiota composition was characterized using 16S sequencing, and the microbiota's role in colitis was evaluated through broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Disease severity was quantified by monitoring weight loss, colon shortening, histopathological damage, and inflammatory cytokine expression. RESULTS: Protein restriction increased the severity of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis compared to the control diet (∗∗∗P < 0.001). Mice fed arginine-restricted diets exhibited increased colitis (∗P < 0.05). Protein restriction induced significant alterations in gut microbiota composition, and antibiotic-mediated microbiota depletion partially ameliorated colitis severity, revealing a microbiota-dependent mechanism underlying disease exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a complex interplay between dietary protein, epithelial mTORC1 signaling, and gut microbiota in modulating IBD pathogenesis and highlights the potential for targeted dietary strategies, including amino acid supplementation, to improve disease management in patients with IBD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary protein level and amino acid (AA) balance are crucial determinants of animal health and productivity. Supplementing rumen-protected AAs in low-protein diets was considered as an efficient strategy to improve the growth performance of ruminants. The colon serves as a crucial conduit for nutrient metabolism during rumen-protected methionine (RPMet) and rumen-protected lysine (RPLys) supplementation, however, it has been challenging to clarify which specific microbiota and their metabolites play a pivotal role in this process. Here, we applied metagenomic and metabolomic approaches to compare the characteristic microbiome and metabolic strategies in the colon of lambs fed a control diet (CON), a low-protein diet (LP) or a LP diet supplemented with RPMet and RPLys (LR). RESULTS: The LP treatment decreased the average daily weight gain (ADG) in lambs, while the LR treatment tended to elicit a remission in ADG. The butyrate molar concentration was greater (P < 0.05), while acetate molar concentration (P < 0.05) was lower for lambs fed the LP and LR diets compared to those fed the CON diet. Moreover, the LP treatment remarkably decreased total AA concentration (P < 0.05), while LR treatment showed an improvement in the concentrations of methionine, lysine, leucine, glutamate, and tryptophan. Metagenomic insights proved that the microbial metabolic potentials referring to biosynthesis of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and AAs in the colon were remarkably altered by three dietary treatments. Metagenomic binning identified distinct microbial markers for the CON group (Alistipes spp., Phocaeicola spp., and Ruminococcus spp.), LP group (Fibrobacter spp., Prevotella spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Escherichia coli), and LR group (Akkermansia muciniphila and RUG099 spp.). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RPMet and RPLys supplementation to the low-protein diet could enhance the microbial biosynthesis of butyrate and amino acids, enriche the beneficial bacteria in the colon, and thereby improve the growth performance of lambs."

      "abstract": "The vast majority of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) who transition to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are treated with dialysis. Given that dialysis does not always have the intended effects of increasing longevity and/or improving health, particularly in those with high comorbidity burden and/or older age groups, there has been increasing emphasis on interventions that delay or avert the need for renal replacement therapy. Among the multi-disciplinary approaches used to reduce CKD progression, dietary interventions are a major cornerstone. Current guidelines support the role of a low-protein diet in patients with moderate to advanced CKD who are metabolically stable. In addition to dietary protein amount, there is evidence that dietary protein sources as well as nutrients in plant-based foods have an important impact on kidney health outcomes. Clinical practice guidelines, including the 2020 National Kidney Foundation and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in CKD, recommend a low protein diet for patients with moderate to advanced non-dialysis dependent (NDD)-CKD who are metabolically stable to reduce risk of ESKD and death. In addition to recommending lower protein intake, the recent 2024 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes CKD Guidelines include a Practice Point advising that people with CKD eat more plant-based foods than animal-based foods. Increasing data also show that plant-based diets are associated with lower risk of progression of CKD and its complications including cardiovascular disease (cardio-kidney-metabolic syndrome), acid-base balance disorders, mineral bone disease, and dysglycemia.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the dietary lysine (Lys)/ methionine (Met) ratio in a low-protein diet on short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles, villus morphology, antioxidant capacity, and immune status of the jejunum in Tibetan sheep. METHODS: A total of 90 weaned Tibetan sheep, each 2 months old with an initial weight of 15.37 ± 0.92 kg, were randomly divided into three treatment groups. These groups were supplemented with different Lys/Met ratios of 3 [low protein-high methionine (LP-H)], 2 [low protein-medium methionine (LP-M)], and 1 [low protein-low methionine (LP-L)] in the basal diet (10% crude protein). The feeding trial lasted 100 days, including a 10-day acclimation period and a 90-day experimental period. RESULTS: The hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) sections showed that the LP-L group had a significantly increased villus height compared to the LP-M and LP-H groups (p < 0.05). In addition, the LP-L group showed higher levels of Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and Total Antioxidant Capacity (T-AOC) concentrations (p < 0.05). A lower concentration of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) was observed in the LP-H group (p < 0.05). The activities of α-amylase, chymotrypsin, and lipase were higher in the LP-L group compared to the LP-H group (p < 0.05). Bacterial sequencing showed that both Chao1 and ACE richness were significantly increased in the LP-L group (p < 0.05), suggesting that the species richness in the jejunum is connected to the ratio of dietary Lys/Met. Furthermore, lowering the dietary Lys/ Met ratio significantly increased the abundance of Romboutsia, the Ruminococcus gauvreauii group, the Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group, Ruminococcus 2, and the Christensenellaceae R-7 group (p < 0.05) while decreasing the abundance of Methanobrevibacter (p < 0.05). Several differential metabolites, including beta-alanine, pantothenate, pantothenic acid, phosphoenolpyruvate, cysteine, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, isodeoxycholic acid, glutamate conjugated cholic acid, and 3-dehydrocholic acid, were significantly increased in the LP-L group (p < 0.05). The functional analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations indicated that these metabolites were mainly involved in pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, ferroptosis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Several genes related to barrier function, such as Occludin and Muc- 2, were upregulated in the LP-L group (p < 0.05), while IL-6 and TNF-α were downregulated (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Collectively, our results suggest that the dietary Met/ Lys ratio could affect the jejunal SCFA concentration by modulating the microbial community and regulating metabolism, thereby contributing to jejunal barrier function. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of Lys/Met diet supplementation in the nutritional management of Tibetan sheep, particularly when reducing the dietary crude protein (CP) level."

However, they may have adverse effects on the growth performance of broiler chickens, which has limited their widespread application. This study aims to explore the impact of adding protease (PRO) to LPRO diets on the growth performance of broiler chickens, especially under conditions with or without the presence of Bacillus coagulans (BC), in order to provide theoretical support for the scientific application and promotion of LPRO feeds. We selected 432 one-day-old broiler chickens and divided them into four treatment groups, which were fed with the control (CON) diet, the LPRO diet, the PRO diet (LPRO diet with added protease), and the PAB diet (PRO diet with added BC). The LPRO group demonstrated decreased growth performance while both PRO and PAB diets resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05). Both PRO and PAB diets significantly enhanced the expression of amino acid transport genes and tight junction genes (p < 0.05) and optimized the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Overall, LPRO diets have a detrimental effect on the growth of broiler chickens, while the PRO and PAB diets effectively counteract these negative effects by improving protein digestion, amino acid absorption, and intestinal health."

      "abstract": "High energy diets are a risk factor for intestinal barrier damage. Butyrate, a major energy source for intestinal epithelial cells, has been shown to improve barrier dysfunction and modulate the gut microbiota. In this trial, we examined the preventative effect of coated sodium butyrate (CSB) on high-energy and low-protein (HELP)-induced intestinal barrier injury in laying hens, and also worked to determine the underlying mechanisms by an integrative analysis of gut microbiota and the metabolome. A total of 216 healthy 28-week-old Huafeng laying hens were randomly assigned to 3 groups with 6 replicates each: the CON group (normal diet), HELP group (HELP diet) and CH500 group (500 mg/kg CSB added to HELP diet). The duration of the trial encompassed a period of 10 weeks. The results revealed that CSB treatment improved the laying rate and mitigated the detrimental effects on intestinal barrier function and the inflammatory response induced by the HELP diet in laying hens (P < 0.05). Microbial profiling analysis revealed that the CSB treatment reshaped the HELP-perturbed gut microbiota and promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria (P < 0.05). Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that CSB reduced the metabolites associated with intestinal inflammation (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CSB did not merely modulate alterations in the gut microbiota composition and microbial metabolites but also yielded increased egg production, while mitigating intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammatory responses induced by HELP in laying hens."

However, adherence to such a diet often poses challenges, leading to low treatment engagement. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new resources to aid in dietary self-monitoring. The goal is to develop and implement \"AminoApp,\" an application tailored for dietary self-monitoring in patients with inborn errors of metabolism who are on a low-protein diet. METHODS: The design and development of the application adhered to the user-centered design method. This approach emphasizes active participation and collaboration between users and designers/researchers throughout all stages of product development, including requirement gathering, prototype development, and evaluation. Usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale, which has been validated in Portuguese. RESULTS: The application's features include a food diary, a food consultation area, exam records, a recipe calculator, and reports on diet composition and metabolic control. The usability test included four patients on a low-protein diet, three caregivers, and three healthcare professionals. The average usability score was 84.9, with averages of 77.5 for patients, 85.8 for caregivers, and 91.6 for professionals, indicating that the application is user-friendly. CONCLUSIONS: AminoApp is the first application developed in Brazil designed to assist in managing inborn errors of metabolism that require a protein-restricted diet. It was found to be easy to use, and the initial results are promising. Further research is necessary to evaluate the impact of the application on metabolic control and treatment adherence."

However, the effect of low protein diet on the mineral uptake and utilization in broilers needs to be explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of low-protein diet on the growth performance, N deposition, mineral contents in serum, tissues and excreta, and the activities and gene expression of related enzymes in tissues of medium-growing yellow-feathered broilers, so as to elucidate the relationship between dietary protein level and the absorption and utilization of minerals in broilers. A total of 72 1-d-old Spotted-Brown male broilers were randomly allotted to 1 of 2 treatments with 6 replicate cages of 6 birds per cage for each treatment. The dietary crude protein (CP) levels for the two treatments were 21 % (the control treatment) and 19 % (low protein treatment), respectively. The experimental period was 30 d. The results showed that no differences (P > 0.05) were detected in average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed: gain ratio of broilers during 1 to 30 d between the two treatments. However, low protein intake increased (P < 0.05) N retention rate, serum P, Cu and Mn, and excreta Cu, Mn and Zn, and decreased (P < 0.05) liver P and excreta P. In addition, birds fed low protein diet had higher (P < 0.05) manganese superoxide dismutase, and total superoxide dismutase activities in liver, and total antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde content in heart, and lower (P < 0.05) copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) and succinate dehydrogenase activities in liver and CuZnSOD mRNA level in heart. In conclusion, the reduction of dietary CP content from 21 % to 19 % improved N retention, the absorption of P, Cu and Mn, as well as the antioxidant ability of liver and heart, and influenced metabolic utilization of P, Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn in medium-growing yellow-feathered broilers from 1 to 30 d of age.",

      "abstract": "The research aimed to examine the impact of coated cysteamine (CS) and choline chloride (CC) on relieving the pathological effects of fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) in laying hens. FLHS was induced by a high-energy low-protein (HELP) diet. Ninety laying hens were equally divided into 5 treatments with 6 replicates per treatment (3 hens/replicate). The control treatment (Cont) was fed a basal diet, while the remaining treatments were fed a HELP diet. Under the HELP dietary plan, 4 treatments were set by a 2 × 2 factorial design. Two levels of CS (CS-: 0.00 mg/kg CS; CS+: 100 mg/kg diet) and 2 levels of choline (CC-: 1,182 mg/kg; CC+: 4,124 mg/kg) were set and named CS-CC- (HELP), CS+CC-, CS-CC+ and CS+CC+. The liver of the CS-CC- (HELP) group became yellowish-brown and greasy, with hemorrhages and bleeding spots. Elevated (P < 0.05) plasma and hepatic ALT and AST and hepatic MDA levels, combined with reduced (P < 0.05) plasma and hepatic SOD and GSH-Px activities in the CS-CC- (HELP) group proved that FLHS was successfully induced. Dietary supplementation of CS, CC, or both (CS+CC+) in HELP diets relieved the pathological changes, significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the AST and ALT levels, and strengthened the antioxidant potential in laying hens under FLHS. The highest (P < 0.001) plasma adiponectin concentration was observed in the CS+CC- and lowest in the CS-CC- (HELP) group. In addition, CS and CC supplementation lowers the elevated levels of hepatic T-CHO and TG by increasing the HDL-C and reducing LDL-C levels (P < 0.05) than CS-CC- (HELP) group. CS supplementation, either alone or with CC, helps laying hens restore their egg production. It could be stated that CS and CC supplements could ameliorate the adverse effects of FLHS by regulating antioxidant enzymes activities, modulating the hepatic lipid metabolism, and restoring the production performance in laying hens. Hence, adding CS and CC could be an effective way to reduce FLHS in laying hens.",

In this research, serum derived from arthritic transgenic K/BxN mice was administered to naive mice to establish a K/BxN rheumatoid arthritis model. Physiological assessments and histological staining were performed to evaluate joint pathology. (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) ELISA was used to measure inflammatory cytokines. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were applied to characterize macrophage phenotypes. Transcriptomic analysis elucidated molecular pathways under the effect of a low-protein diet and verified by immunoblotting. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by Mito-SOX. Protein expression was silenced through the application of siRNA transfection. Our results indicate that a low-protein diet significantly alleviates disease symptoms and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in synovial fluid. Furthermore, this dietary intervention inhibits M1 macrophage polarization while promoting a shift towards the M2 phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the beneficial effects of the low-protein diet in alleviating rheumatoid arthritis are closely linked to the NRF2 pathway. In vitro, low protein treatment can promote the activity of NRF2 via inhibiting the ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and activate the NRF2/SIRT3/SOD2 pathway to inhibit the production of ROS, which will further inhibit the M1 macrophage polarization. NRF2 knockdown can abolish the effects of low-protein treatment, indicating that the inhibition of M1 polarization and the anti-inflammatory response induced by low-protein treatment are dependent on NRF2. In summary, our findings propose that low-protein diet can inhibit synovial macrophage M1 polarization via activating NRF2/SIRT3/SOD2 pathway to reduce mitochondrial ROS production. This mechanism effectively decreases synovial inflammation and alleviates RA symptoms."

In addition, physical exercise could prevent and treat various illnesses and chronic diseases. The objective of the study was to search for and appraise evidence on the effect of additional physical exercise on patients' nutritional status and indicators of disease progression when compared with the LPD alone. PubMed Central, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Knowledge for randomized controlled trials (published between January 1, 1956 and May 17, 2023) were searched. A total of 8698 identified studies, 9 were eligible and were included in our analysis (N = 250 participants). Compared with the LPD alone, additional physical exercise reduced serum creatinine by a mean of -0.21 mg/dL (95% CI -0.39 to -0.03) in CKD patients. Similarly, blood pressure decreased after physical exercise, with systolic blood pressure decreasing by -7.05 mm Hg (95% CI -13.13 to -0.96) and diastolic blood pressure decreasing by -5.31 mm Hg (95% CI -7.99 to -2.62). Subgroup analyses revealed that resistance exercise (RE) was effective in decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of -1.71 mL/min per 1.73 m² (95% CI -3.29 to -0.14). In addition, the VO2peak increasing by 2.41 mL/kg/min (95% CI 0.13 to 4.70) when physical exercise was continued for 24 weeks. The above results suggest that the LPD with additional physical exercise care is more beneficial for patients with CKD.",

Intervention consisted of LPD supplemented with ketoanalogues of essential amino acids (KA) along with conventional nephroprotective therapy. Efficacy parameters were the variation in proteinuria and in eGFR from baseline to the end of the study. Proteinuria decreased 3-fold, and the rate of decline in eGFR decreased 5-fold in the intervention phase. No patient initiated KRT or died.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of LPD treatment in older adults with advanced CKD. METHODS: The EQUAL study is a prospective, observational study including patients ≥65 years of age with an incident estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 ml/min/1.73 m2 in six European countries with follow-up through 6 years. Nutritional status was assessed by a 7-point subjective global assessment (SGA) every 3-6 months. Prescribed diet (g protein/kg of bodyweight) was recorded on every study visit; measured protein intake was available in three countries. Time to death and decline in nutritional status (SGA decrease of ≥2 points) were analysed using marginal structural models with dynamic inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights. RESULTS: Of 1738 adults (631 prescribed LPD at any point during follow-up), there were 1319 with repeated SGA measurements, of which 267 (20%) decreased in SGA ≥2 points and 565 (32.5%) who died. There was no difference in survival or decrease in nutritional status for patients prescribed a LPD ≤0.8 g/kg ideal bodyweight {odds ratio [OR] for mortality 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.55)] and OR for decrease in SGA 1.11 [95% CI 0.74-1.66]} in the adjusted models. In patients prescribed a LPD <0.6 g/kg ideal bodyweight, the results were similar. There was a significant interaction with LPD and older age >75 years, lower SGA and higher comorbidity burden for both mortality and nutritional status decline. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with CKD approaching end-stage kidney disease, a traditional LPD prescribed and monitored according to routine clinical practice in Europe appears to be safe.",

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (Lp. plantarum) FRT4 on FLHS model in laying hen with a focus on liver lipid metabolism, and gut microbiota. RESULTS: The FLHS model of laying hens was established by feeding a high-energy low-protein (HELP) diet, and the treatment groups were fed a HELP diet supplemented with differential proportions of Lp. plantarum FRT4. The results indicated that Lp. plantarum FRT4 increased laying rate, and reduced the liver lipid accumulation by regulating lipid metabolism (lipid synthesis and transport) and improving the gut microbiota composition. Moreover, Lp. plantarum FRT4 regulated the liver glycerophospholipid metabolism. Meanwhile, \"gut-liver\" axis analysis showed that there was a correlation between gut microbiota and lipid metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that Lp. plantarum FRT4 improved the laying performance and alleviated FLHS in HELP diet-induced laying hens through regulating \"gut-liver\" axis. Our findings reveal that glycerophospholipid metabolism could be the underlying mechanism for the anti-FLHS effect of Lp. plantarum FRT4 and for future use of Lp. plantarum FRT4 as an excellent additive for the prevention and mitigation of FLHS in laying hens."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data were searched and reviewed up to January 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were enrolled and analyzed using STATA MP 17. In this review, serum albumin (Alb), body mass index (BMI), and serum prealbumin (PA) were included for efficacy evaluation and serum calcium (CA) for safety evaluation. Potential heterogeneity was detected using subgroup analyses. RESULTS: 7 RCTs were included. Compared with LPD, sLPD can improve the Alb [Weighted Mean Difference (WMD)=4.16; 95% CI: 2.50, 5.83; p<0.0001), BMI [WMD=1.35; 95% CI: 0.59, 2.11; p<0.0001] and PA [WMD=0.07; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.10; p<0.0001] level of patients undergoing PD. Subgroup analyses showed that, although Alb had no difference with LPD within 12 months of PD duration, sLPD treatment could improve the levels of Alb and PA regardless of PD duration or course of treatment. sLPD can improve the BMI of patients with a PD duration of more than 24 months, regardless of the duration of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A sLPD is an effective intervention for improving the nutritional status of PD patients. It is suggested that patients undergoing PD should initiate sLPD at the beginning of PD to ensure sufficient nutritional intake.",

      "abstract": "Although Randomized clinical trials (RCT) represent the gold standard to compare two or more treatments, the impact of observational studies cannot be ignored. Obviously, these latter are performed on unbalanced sample, and differences among the compared groups could be detected. These differences could have an impact on the estimated association between our allocation and our outcome. To avoid it, some methods should be applied in the analysis of observational cohort. Propensity score (PS) can be considered as a value which sums up and balances the known variables. It aims to adjust or balance the probability of receiving a specific allocation group, and could be used to match, stratify, weight, and perform a covariate adjustment. PS is calculated with a logistic regression, using allocation groups as the outcome. Thanks to PS, we compute the probability of being allocated to one group and we can match patients obtaining two balanced groups. It avoids computing analysis in unbalanced groups. We compared low protein diet (LPD) and the Mediterranean diet in CKD patients and analysed them using the PS methods. Nutritional therapy is fundamental for the prevention, progression and treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its complications. An individualized, stepwise approach is essential to guarantee high adherence to nutritional patterns and to reach therapeutic goals. The best dietary regimen is still a matter of discussion. In our example, unbalanced analysis showed a significant renal function preservation in LPD, but this correlation was denied after the PS analysis. In conclusion, although unmatched analysis showed differences between the two diets, after propensity analysis no differences were detected. If RCT cannot be performed, balancing the PS score allows to balance the sample and avoids biased results.",

However, the mechanism underlying the protective effect of BBR against FLHS remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of BBR on FLHS induced by a high-energy, low-protein (HELP) diet and explore the involvement of the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in the protective effects. A total of 90 healthy 140-day-old Hy-line laying hens were randomly divided into three groups, including a control group (fed a basic diet), a HELP group (fed a HELP diet), and a HELP+BBR group (high-energy, high-protein diet supplemented with BBR instead of maize). Our results show that BBR supplementation alleviated liver injury and hepatic steatosis in laying hens. Moreover, BBR supplementation could significantly regulate the gut's microbial composition, increasing the abundance of Actinobacteria and Romboutsia. In addition, the BBR supplement altered the profile of bile acid. Furthermore, the gut microbiota participates in bile acid metabolism, especially taurochenodeoxycholic acid and α-muricholic acid. BBR supplementation could regulate the expression of genes and proteins related to glucose metabolism, lipid synthesis (FAS, SREBP-1c), and bile acid synthesis (FXR, CYP27a1). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that BBR might be a potential feed additive for preventing FLHS by regulating the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism.",

However, sVLPD could expose the patient to the risk of malnutrition. This diet is also difficult to implement due to the required intake of large number of keto-analogue/amino acid tablets. In our Center, the Department of Nephrology and Dialysis of Azienda Sanitaria Territoriale n 1, Pesaro-Urbino, of Italy, respecting the guidelines of normal clinical practice, we prescribed sVLPD (0.3 g/prot/day) supplemented with only essential amino acids without the use of ketoanalogues in stage 5 patients and verified its efficacy, safety and clinical and economic effects. Over the 24 months period of observation the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) slowed down (mean eGFR 11.6 ± 3.3 vs. 9.3 ± 2.7 mL/min/1.73 m2, p < 0.001) and the start of the dialysis treatment (adjusted HR = 0.361, CI 0.200-0.650, p = 0.001) was delayed without evidence of malnutrition, in compliant vs. non-compliant patients. This led to a substantial cost reduction for the National Health System. This non-interventional longitudinal observational study is part of standard clinical practice and suggests that VLPD supplemented with essential amino acids could be extensively used to reduce the incidence of dialysis treatments, with a favorable economic impact on the NHS.",

      "abstract": "Nutritional therapy is a cornerstone of the clinical management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials often have failed to show a relevant benefit of low-protein diets in nonselected CKD populations in terms of slowing the progression of kidney disease and need for dialysis. The more the target population is selected, the less the results can be generalizable to implement in clinical practice. On the contrary, observational studies, especially if performed with patient-centered, flexible approaches, point toward an extensive implementation of dietary protein restriction in different and unselected CKD populations. The observational evidence cannot be disregarded anymore. The most recent guidelines advise implementing low-protein diets or even very-low-protein diets in all CKD patients as early as stage 3. However, the lack of data from large randomized controlled trials on unselected CKD populations as well as on specific subpopulations, such as diabetic or obese patients, which nowadays comprise the majority of CKD subjects, reduces the generalizability of the recommendations. For some patient populations, such as those encompassing very old, nephrotic, or pregnant patients, the literature is even more limited because of the lower prevalence of these conditions and diffused prejudices against reducing protein intake. This pragmatic review discusses the need for integrating information derived from randomized trials with evidence derived from observational studies to guide feasible strategies for more successful implementation of low-protein diets in the treatment of all segments of the CKD population.",

However, most studies conducted thus far have focused on the preventive effects of LPDs on metabolic syndromes. To test the therapeutic potential of LPD, we treated a lipodystrophy mouse model IRFKO (adipose-specific insulin receptor knockout) in this study. We have previously shown that IRFKO mice have profound insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and whitening of interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), closely mimicking the phenotypes in lipoatrophic diabetic patients. Here, we demonstrate that 14-day of LPD (5.1% kcal from protein) feeding is sufficient to reduce postprandial blood glucose, improve insulin resistance, and normalize glucose tolerance in the IRFKO mice. This profound metabolic improvement is associated with BAT activation and increase in whole body energy expenditure. To confirm, we showed that surgical denervation of BAT attenuated the beneficial metabolic effects of LPD feeding in IRFKO mice, including the 'browning' effects on BAT and the glucose-ameliorating results. However, BAT denervation failed to affect the body weight-lowering effects of LPD. Together, our results imply a therapeutic potential to use LPD for the treatment of lipoatrophic diabetes.",

Methods: we randomized 54 patients with CKD into two groups. Dietary protein intake compliance was evaluated using a 3-day dietary diary and 24-h urine nitrogen levels. The primary outcomes were indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), and secondary outcomes included inflammation marker levels, nutritional status, and renal function. We assessed 89 patients for eligibility, and a total of 45 patients completed the study, including 23 and 22 in the inulin-added and control groups, respectively. Results: PCS values decreased in both groups after intervention: inulin-added group, ∆PCS -1.33 (-4.88, -0.63) μg/mL vs. LPD group, -4.7 (-3.78, 3.69) μg/mL (p = 0.058). PCS values reduced from 7.52 to 4.02 μg/mL (p < 0.001) in the inulin-added group (p < 0.001). Moreover, IS decreased from 3.42 (2.53, 6.01) μg/mL to 2.83 (1.67, 4.74) μg/mL after adding inulin; ∆IS was -0.64 (-1.48, 0.00) μg/mL, and a significant difference was observed compared with the control group (p = 0.004). The inflammation index decreased after intervention. Conclusion: dietary fiber supplementation may reduce serum IS and PCS levels and modulate their inflammatory status in predialysis CKD patients.",

A low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacids has been duly documented to reduce the malnutrition associated with CKD as well as improve estimated glomeruli filtration rate while delaying the onset of dialysis in predialysis CKD patients. Objective The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacids compared to a conventional low protein on nutritional indices in predialysis CKD patients. Methods and materials A randomized controlled trial with a total of 60 participants was conducted at Delta State University Teaching Hospital (DELSUTH), Oghara, Nigeria. Participants were patients older than 18 years with CKD stage 3-5 who were not on dialysis. They were recruited and randomized into the intervention group (low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacids) with 30 participants and the non-intervention group (low protein with placebo) with 30 participants. The mean outcome was changed in the nutritional indices from baseline till the end of the study. Results A total of 60 patients were randomly allocated to receive a low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacids (n=30) or control (n=30). All participants were included in the analysis of all outcomes. The mean change score in serum total protein, albumin, and triglycerides between the intervention and non-intervention groups were 1.1±1.1 g/dL vs 0.1±1.1 g/dL (p<0.001), 0.2±0.9 g/dL vs -0.3±0.8 g/dL (p<0.001), and 3.0±3.5 g/dL vs 1.8±3.7 g/dL, respectively. Conclusion and recommendation The use of low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacids improved the anthropometric and nutritional indices in patients with stage 3-5 CKD."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the effect of low-protein diet (LPD) is expected to alleviate uremic symptoms. However, whether LPD is effective in preventing loss of kidney function is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between LPD and renal outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of 325 patients who suffered CKD stage 4 and 5 with eGFR ≥10 mL/min/1.73 m,2 between January 2008 and December 2014. The primary diseases of the patients were chronic glomerulonephritis (47.7%), nephrosclerosis (16.9%), diabetic nephropathy (26.2%), and others (9.2%). The patients were divided into four groups, based on the mean protein intake (PI)/day, group 1 (n = 76): PI < 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day, group 2 (n = 56): 0.5 ≤ PI < 0.6 g/kg/day, group 3 (n = 110): 0.6 ≤ PI < 0.8 g/kg/day, group 4 (n = 83): PI ≥ 0.8 g/kg/day. Dietary supplementation with essential amino acids and ketoanalogues was not used. The outcome measure was occurrence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal transplantation (excluding preemptive transplantation)) and all-cause mortality until December 2018. Cox regression models were used to examine whether LPD was associated with the risk of outcomes. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 4.1 ± 2.2 years. Thirty-three patients (10.2%) died of all causes, 163 patients (50.2%) needed to start RRT, and 6 patients (1.8%) received a renal transplant. LPD therapy of 0.5 g/kg/day or less was significantly related to a lower risk of RRT and all-cause mortality [Hazard ratio = 0.656; 95% confidence interval, 0.438 to 0.984, P = .042]. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that non-supplemented LPD therapy of 0.5 g/kg/day or less may prolong the initiation of RRT in stage 4 and 5 CKD patients.",

A study showed depressive symptoms are more common in populations with an LPD. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with CKD. METHODS: A total of 571 CKD patients were enrolled in this study. The LPD was defined with dietary protein intake ≤0.8 g/kg/day. We divided the CKD into mild CKD and advanced CKD according to severity, as well as diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and non-DKD according to DM. The logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between an LPD and depressive symptoms as well as HRQOL in CKD patients and each subgroup. RESULTS: An LPD had significantly higher unadjusted Odds Ratio (OR) (1.81, [95% for Confidence Interval (CI), 1.18-2.76]) and multivariate-adjusted OR (1.80, [1.15-2.81]) for depressive symptoms. Moreover, an LPD showed significantly higher unadjusted OR (2.08, 1.44-3.01]) and multivariate OR (2.04, [1.38-3.02]) for poor HRQOL. In DKD subgroups, an LPD had a significant increase in unadjusted OR (2.00, [1.12-3.57]) and multivariate OR (1.99, [1.01-3.44]) for depressive symptoms. The advanced CKD group also showed that an LPD had significantly higher unadjusted OR (1.97, [1.13-3.42]) and multivariate OR (2.03, [1.12-3.73]) for depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: An LPD for CKD patients was significantly associated with depressive symptoms and poor HRQOL. Subgroup analysis indicated that DKD and advanced CKD are more predisposed to depressive symptoms and poor HRQOL.",

      "abstract": "Dietary protein restriction has long been a cornerstone of nutritional therapy for patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). However, the recommended amount of dietary protein intake is different across guidelines. This is partly because previous randomized controlled trials have reported conflicting results regarding the efficacy of protein restriction in terms of kidney outcomes. Interestingly, a vegetarian, very low protein diet has been shown to reduce the risk of kidney failure among patients with advanced CKD, without increasing the incidence of hyperkalemia. This finding suggests that the source of protein may also influence the kidney outcomes. Furthermore, a plant-dominant low-protein diet (PLADO) has recently been proposed as an alternative dietary therapy for patients with CKD. There are several potential mechanisms by which plant-based diets would benefit patients with CKD. For example, plant-based diets may reduce the production of gut-derived uremic toxins by increasing the intake of fiber, and are useful for correcting metabolic acidosis and hyperphosphatemia. Plant proteins are less likely to induce glomerular hyperfiltration than animal proteins. Furthermore, plant-based diets increase magnesium intake, which may prevent vascular calcification. More evidence is needed to establish the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of PLADO as a new adjunct therapy in real-world patients with CKD.",

This study aimed to evaluate whether a ketoanalogue supplemental low-protein diet (sLPD) (0.6 g/kg body weight per day) could also reduce the risks of dialysis among CKD stage 4 patients. Methods: Patients aged >20 years with a diagnosis of stage 4 CKD who subsequently received ketosteril treatment, which is the most commonly used ketoanalogue of essential amino acids, between 2003 and 2018 were identified from the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD). Then, these individuals were divided into two groups according to the continuation of ketosteril for more than three months or not. The primary outcome was ESKD requiring maintenance dialysis. Results: With one-year follow-up, the continuation group (n = 303) exhibited a significantly lower incidence of new-onset end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring maintenance dialysis (6.8% vs. 10.4%, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41−0.94) in comparison to the discontinuation group (n = 238). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that initiating sLPDs since CKD stage 4 may additionally reduce the short-term risks of commencing dialysis without increasing CV events, infections, or mortality.",

      "abstract": "In rats, the time of birth is characterized by a transient rise in beta cell replication, as well as beta cell neogenesis and the functional maturation of the endocrine pancreas. However, the knowledge of the gene expression during this period of beta cell expansion is incomplete. The aim was to characterize the perinatal rat pancreas transcriptome and to identify regulatory pathways differentially regulated at the whole organ level in the offspring of mothers fed a regular control diet (CO) and of mothers fed a low-protein diet (LP). We performed mRNA expression profiling via the microarray analysis of total rat pancreas samples at embryonic day (E) 20 and postnatal days (P) 0 and 2. In the CO group, pancreas metabolic pathways related to sterol and lipid metabolism were highly enriched, whereas the LP diet induced changes in transcripts involved in RNA transcription and gene regulation, as well as cell migration and apoptosis. Moreover, a number of individual transcripts were markedly upregulated at P0 in the CO pancreas: growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6), legumain (Lgmn), Ets variant gene 5 (Etv5), alpha-fetoprotein (Afp), dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6), and angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4). The LP diet induced the downregulation of a large number of transcripts, including neurogenin 3 (Neurog3), Etv5, Gas6, Dusp6, signaling transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), growth hormone receptor (Ghr), prolactin receptor (Prlr), and Gas6 receptor (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase; Axl), whereas upregulated transcripts were related to inflammatory responses and cell motility. We identified differentially regulated genes and transcriptional networks in the perinatal pancreas. These data revealed marked adaptations of exocrine and endocrine in the pancreas to the low-protein diet, and the data can contribute to identifying novel regulators of beta cell mass expansion and functional maturation and may provide a valuable tool in the generation of fully functional beta cells from stem cells to be used in replacement therapy.",

However, there is limited clinical research on the skeletal muscle nutrition of patients with CKD. We carried out this study to find out whether a low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacids (LPD + KA) could improve muscle wasting in patients with CKD. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in this non-blind, parallel-group, randomized trial assessing the nutritional status of CKD, randomly assigned to either the LPD + KA group or conventional LPD group. Blood samples such as Hemoglobin, Cystatin C, Creatinine, BUN, Albumin, Pre- Albumin, Glycerin Trilaurate, and Cholesterol were measured at baseline and every 3 months. The parameters of skeletal muscle and other body composition were assessed before and after dietary intervention for 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients with CKD completed the study and were available for further analysis. The hemoglobin and albumin were observed to be markedly improved in the LPD + KA group during the follow-up as compared to baseline. Body mass index and total body water index of both groups were increased upon follow-up but the increase in the LPD + KA group was comparatively higher. Moreover, an increase in body fat%, skeletal muscle mass index, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index was observed in both groups between baseline and follow-up, but it was statistically insignificant. CONCLUSION: This study did not find a significant improvement of KAs on muscle wasting, and a long time or more indices study may need to find the effects of the LPD + KA diets.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A vegetarian very low-protein diet (VLPD) supplemented with ketoanalogues of essential amino acids Ketoanalogue-supplemented very low-protein diet (sVLPD) delays dialysis initiation in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this cost-effectiveness analysis, we compare an sVLPD with a conventional low-protein diet (LPD) in patients with CKD stage 4-5 using data from Taiwan and Thailand. DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model simulated health outcomes and care costs in patients receiving an sVLPD (0.3-0.4 g/kg-day, vegetarian diet) supplemented with ketoanalogues (1 tablet/5 kg-day) or an LPD (0.6 g/kg-day, mixed proteins). Health state transition probability and resource cost inputs were based on published literature and local sources, respectively. RESULTS: An sVLPD increased survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a lower cost than an LPD. Total cost of care in Taiwan was 2,262,592.30 New Taiwan dollars (NTD) (68,059.35 EUR) with an LPD and 1,096,938.20 NTD (32,996.18 EUR) with an sVLPD (difference -1,165,654.10 NTD; -35,063.17 EUR). Total cost of care in Thailand was 500,731.09 Thai baht (THB) (14,584.12 EUR) with an LPD and 421,019.22 THB (12,262.46 EUR) with an sVLPD (difference -79,711.86 THB; -2,321.66 EUR). CONCLUSION: A ketoanalogue-supplemented vegetarian sVLPD increased QALYs and lowered lifetime care costs versus an LPD in patients with predialysis CKD in Taiwan and Thailand. These data, together with the new KDOQI Guidelines for nutrition in CKD, support dietary intervention using ketoanalogue-supplemented vegetarian sVLPDs to prevent CKD progression and postpone dialysis as a cost-effective approach, with beneficial effects for patients and health care providers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of low protein diets balanced with four amino acids on growth performance, meat quality and cecal microflora of finishing pigs. Fifty-four healthy hybrid barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) with an average body weight of 70.12 ± 4.03 kg were randomly assigned to one of the three dietary treatments with six replicate pens per treatment (three barrows per pen). The three dietary treatments included a normal protein diet (NP), a low protein diet (LP) and a very low protein diet (VLP). RESULTS: The average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio of pigs were not significantly changed with the LP and VLP diets compared to the NP diet (P > 0.05). The water holding capacity and shear force of longissimus dorsi muscle were decreased, whereas the intramuscular fat content of the longissimus dorsi muscle was increased (P < 0.05) in pigs fed with the LP and VLP diets compared to the NP diet. The contents of saturated fatty acids in muscle were decreased (P < 0.05), whereas the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in muscle was increased (P < 0.01) with the VLP diet compared to the NP diet. The contents of histamine, spermidine, spermine and tyramine of muscle were decreased with the VLP diet compared to the NP diet (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of Turicibacter, Terrisporobacter, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and UCG-005 was higher (P < 0.05), whereas the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus was lower (P < 0.05) in pigs fed with the LP and VLP diets compared to the NP diet. Based on the correlation of cecal microbiota and cecal biogenic amine, the contents of tyramine, spermidine and histamine were negatively correlated with the abundance of Terrisporobacter (P < 0.01) and the content of histamine was positively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Balanced with four essential amino acids, the VLP diet with crude protein levels decreased by > 4% increased the intramuscular fat content, changed the fatty acid and amino acid composition of longissimus dorsi muscle and the profile of cecum microbiota, and reduced the content of cecum bioamine, with no negative effect on the growth performance of pigs. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low protein supplemented with α-ketoacid diet (LKD) was recommended to be an essential intervention to delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients who were not yet on dialysis. Aberrant gut microbiota and metabolism have been reported to be highly associated with CKD. However, the effect of LKD on gut microbiota and related fecal metabolism in CKD remains unclear. METHODS: Mice were fed with normal protein diet (NPD group), low protein diet (LPD group), and low protein diet supplemented with α-ketoacid (LKD group) after 5/6 nephrectomy. At the end of the study, blood, kidney tissues, and feces were collected for biochemical analyses, histological, 16S rRNA sequence of gut microbiome, and untargeted fecal metabolomic analyses. RESULTS: Both LKD and LPD alleviate renal failure and fibrosis, and inflammatory statement in 5/6 nephrectomized mice, especially the LKD. In terms of gut microbiome, LKD significantly improved the dysbiosis induced by 5/6Nx, representing increased α-diversity and decreased F/B ratio. Compared with NPD, LKD significantly increased the abundance of g_Parasutterella, s_Parabacteroides_sp_CT06, f_Erysipelotrichaceae, g_Akkermansia, g_Gordonibacter, g_Faecalitalea, and s_Mucispirillum_sp_69, and decreased s_Lachnospiraceae_bacterium_28-4 and g_Lachnoclostridium. Moreover, 5/6Nx and LKD significantly altered fecal metabolome. Then, multi-omics analysis revealed that specific metabolites involved in glycerophospholipid, purine, vitamin B6, sphingolipid, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and microbes associated with LKD were correlated with the amelioration of CKD. CONCLUSION: LKD had a better effect than LPD on delaying renal failure in 5/6 nephrectomy-induced CKD, which may be due to the regulation of affecting the gut microbiome and fecal metabolic profiles."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methionine or lysine has been reported to influence DNA methylation and fat metabolism, but their combined effects in N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) RNA methylation remain unclarified. The combined effects of rumen-protected methionine and lysine (RML) in a low-protein (LP) diet on lipid metabolism, m6A RNA methylation, and fatty acid (FA) profiles in the liver and muscle of lambs were investigated. Sixty-three male lambs were divided into three treatment groups, three pens per group and seven lambs per pen. The lambs were fed a 14.5% crude protein (CP) diet (adequate protein [NP]), 12.5% CP diet (LP), and a LP diet plus RML (LP + RML) for 60 d. RESULTS: The results showed that the addition of RML in a LP diet tended to lower the concentrations of plasma leptin (P = 0.07), triglyceride (P = 0.05), and non-esterified FA (P = 0.08). Feeding a LP diet increased the enzyme activity or mRNA expression of lipogenic enzymes and decreased lipolytic enzymes compared with the NP diet. This effect was reversed by supplementation of RML with a LP diet. The inclusion of RML in a LP diet affected the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), n-3 PUFA, and n-6 PUFA in the liver but not in the muscle, which might be linked with altered expression of FA desaturase-1 (FADS1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). A LP diet supplemented with RML increased (P < 0.05) total m6A levels in the liver and muscle and were accompanied by decreased expression of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and alkB homologue 5 (ALKBH5). The mRNA expressions of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) in the LP + RML diet group were lower than those in the other two groups. Supplementation of RML with a LP diet affected only liver YTH domain family (YTHDF2) proteins (P < 0.05) and muscle YTHDF3 (P = 0.09), which can be explained by limited m6A-binding proteins that were mediated in mRNA fate. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that the inclusion of RML in a LP diet could alter fat deposition through modulations of lipogenesis and lipolysis in the liver and muscle. These changes in fat metabolism may be associated with the modification of m6A RNA methylation. A systematic graph illustrates the mechanism of dietary methionine and lysine influence on lipid metabolism and M6A. The green arrow with triangular heads indicates as activation and brown-wine arrows with flat heads indicates as suppression."

There is no silver bullet for optimal care of CKD. Oxidative stress being well understood and considered as an important common progressive factor for CKD of different etiology. Several research studies focused on reducing oxidative stress and have shown diverse outcomes. In this randomized, open-label, three arms, controlled, single center study we evaluated the role of N acetylcysteine which is a direct scavenger of free radical, in combination with taurine and pyridoxamine in retarding the progression of non-diabetic kidney disease. METHODS: 69 non-dialysis, non-diabetic patients diagnosed with chronic renal failure with GFR more than 15 ml/min/1.73m2 and less than 60ml/min/1.73m2 receiving standard of care were enrolled in the study, of which 22 were in the placebo arm, 23 treated with NT (500 mg Taurine + 150 mg NAC) arm and 24 in the NP (300mg NAC+ 50mg pyridoxamine di-hydrochloride) arm. The subjects in the treatment arm received the study drug twice a day along with low protein (0.6gm protein per Kg body weight) isocaloric diet with 25-30 Kcal/Kg/D and were evaluated monthly up to 6 months. Change in eGFR accorss 3 groups over 6 months were compared. RESULT: Mean age of the subjects was 57 ± 13 years of 56.25% were male and 43.75% were female. 69 patients completed the study. The Empirical Distribution Function (EDF) of NP group was dominant over control and NT group indicating a positive effect of NT on non-diabetic CKD at 10% level of significance. In the subgroup analysis a significant effect was observed in the cases of patients receiving NP with baseline eGFR more than 45 ml/min. The mean increase in eGFR readings over six months was 8.15 units higher in the NP group than in the control group. The two-sided p-values of the t-test, the Wilcoxon test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were 0.0496, 0.0316 and 0.0354, respectively. Thus, all the three tests reject the hypothesis of identical changes in eGFR at the 5% level. In subjects with bicarbonate more than 22 mg/dl, the mean increase in eGFR over six months was 10.86 units higher in the NP group than in the control group indicating NP has a positive effect on increasing eGFR over 6 months, in patients without the presence of any metabolic acidosis. The two-sided p-vales of the t-test, the Wilcoxon test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were 0.0325, 0.0205 and 0.1495, respectively. Thus, two of the three tests reject the hypothesis of identical changes in eGFR at the 5% level which clearly indicates that NP had better efficacy than other groups. CONCLUSION: N-acetyl cysteine along with pyridoxine may be a useful intervention along with a low protein diet in retarding progression of CKD in the nondiabetic population in early CKD.",

      "abstract": "There are no clear dietary recommendations for patients over 70 years of age, while stages 3-5 of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and protein-energy wasting (PEW) is common among this category of patients. Nutritional status is known to be one of the significant factors influencing the prognosis of patients receiving renal replacement therapy. The aim of the research was the analysis of the mechanisms of PEW, methods for assessing the nutritional status and effectiveness of diets with different protein content in patients with CKD based on literature data. Material and methods. The research material was the scientific literature presented in the domestic and international (eLIBRARY, PubMed, Google Scholar) databases, as well as clinical recommendations for the management of geriatric patients with CKD, dietary recommendations for patients with anorexia and other conditions. Results. The studies devoted to the mechanisms of PEW were analyzed. One of the leading causes of this condition is anorexia, in the pathogenesis of which uremic toxins, inflammation and hormonal disorders are involved (hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin, leptin, insulin, testosterone and others may be involved in the pathogenesis). A number of studies have shown that limiting protein to 0.6 g/kg day could significantly reduce uremic dyspepsia risk and slow CKD progression. At the same time, several researchers gave data on the ineffectiveness of a low-protein diet in patients with CKD and diabetes mellitus and a significant risk of malnutrition. Subjective global assessment, the mini nutrition assessment and the geriatric nutritional risk index can be distinguished among the methods of assessing nutritional status. Conclusion. Research data on the effectiveness of a low-protein diet in elderly patients with stage 3B-5 CKD are contradictory. PEW in CKD is common and largely determines survival; the mechanism of PEW is complex. The study of the optimal nutritional diet for elderly patients with predialysis stages of CKD still remains an urgent problem.",

After 2 months of a LPD-a reduction in blood urea nitrogen (52 ± 17 vs. 46 ± 15 mg/dL, p = 0.003), total cholesterol (185 ± 41 vs. 171 ± 34 mg/dL, p = 0.001), and triglycerides (194 ± 148 vs. 161 ± 70 mg/dL, p = 0.03) was observed; 57 subjects were then randomized to receive probiotics or a placebo for the subsequent 3 months.

Therefore, we tested the effect of a 17.6% crude protein (CP) diet on growth and diarrhoea and investigated the effect of a 15.5% CP diet post-weaning on transcriptomic responses, growth, and diarrhoea-related antibiotic treatments. At weaning, pigs were divided into five dietary treatment groups in a three-phase diet from weaning to 30 kg bodyweight. The diets included a positive control group (PC) with medicinal zinc oxide, a negative control group (NC), a 17.6% CP diet based on soy protein concentrate (SP), a 17.6% CP diet based on soybean meal (SB), and a 15.5% CP diet with additional amino acids (XLA). Growth performance and the occurrence of diarrhoea were similar between the SP and SB groups. The XLA pigs had a reduced weight gain and fewer antibiotics treatments caused by diarrhoea, as well as a reduced level of blood proteins. Intestinal tissue samples from the XLA pigs displayed decreased expression of genes involved in nutrient metabolism and immune responses relative to the PC group. In conclusion, a very low CP diet reduces antibiotics treatments, but also adapts gut nutrient metabolism and reduces growth performance."

      "abstract": "Maternal nutrition is found to be the key factor that determines fetal health in utero and metabolic health during adulthood. Metabolic diseases have been primarily attributed to impaired maternal nutrition during pregnancy, and impaired nutrition has been an immense issue across the globe. In recent years, type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached epidemic proportion and is a severe public health problem in many countries. Although plenty of research has already been conducted to tackle T2D which is associated with obesity, little is known regarding the etiology and pathophysiology of lean T2D, a variant of T2D. Recent studies have focused on the effects of epigenetic variation on the contribution of in utero origins of lean T2D, although other mechanisms might also contribute to the pathology. Observational studies in humans and experiments in animals strongly suggest an association between maternal low protein diet and lean T2D phenotype. In addition, clear sex-specific disease prevalence was observed in different studies. Consequently, more research is essential for the understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of lean T2D, which might help to develop better disease prevention and treatment strategies. This review examines the role of protein insufficiency in the maternal diet as the central driver of the developmental programming of lean T2D."

While a low protein diet (LPD) is a cornerstone treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), monitoring the actual performance of LPD is a challenge. PATIENTS: Fifty-seven advanced CKD adult patients were enrolled and LPD prescribed. Compliance was evaluated through the normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), adherence by the dietitian by means of a 24-h dietary recall and concordance by the nephrologist during consultations. Traditional parameters as well as total p-Cresyl Sulphate (t-PCS), total Indoxyl Sulphate (t-IS) and Lipoprotein-associated phspholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) were compared between adherent/not adherent and concordant/not concordant subjects at enrolment and after two months. RESULTS: nPCR, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterol and triglycerides significantly decreased in all patients. t-PCS and t-IS decreased among adherent subjects. Lp-PLA2, t-PCS, free-PCS and t-IS decreased among concordant subjects, while these increased in non-concordant ones. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that LPD may improve the control of traditional uremic toxins and atherogenic toxins in \"adherent\" and \"concordant\" patients. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is needed to evaluate the compliance/adherence/concordance to LPD for optimizing nutritional interventions.",

      "abstract": "A low-protein diet (LPD) is recommended to patients with non-dialysis advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) for delaying renal function decline. However, this approach potentially prevents an adequate calorie and micronutrient intake. We examined the influence of an LPD including a renal-specific oral nutrition supplement (RONS) on the nutrition status of patients with stage 3b-5 CKD. This multicenter, open-label study prospectively enrolled patients over 18 years of age, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 10 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, serum albumin ≥3.0 g/dL, and body mass index ≤30 kg/m2. All participants implemented the LPD with one serving of RONS daily for 6 months. Daily energy intake, nutrition status, renal function, and quality of life were assessed before and after the intervention. Of 53 enrolled patients, 35 (66.0%) completed the study. We found that RONS use increased patients' energy intake and maintained their serum albumin, nutritional status, and quality of life. Body weight and handgrip strength increased significantly at 6 months after enrollment (p = 0.0357); eGFR slightly decreased at 3 and 6 months after enrollment, suggesting that patients' residual renal function was preserved. Our findings support the conclusion that patients with non-dialysis advanced CKD may benefit from additional RONS besides their regular diet. Patients with advanced CKD receiving RONS might achieve better nutrition and delay renal function decline."

To test whether nutritional interventions and a combination with a targeted therapy can effectively cure these cancers, we used the fruit fly Drosophila as a model. In this system, we induced tumors by EGFR overexpression in intestinal stem cells. Limiting the amount of protein in the diet restored life span to that of control animals. In combination with a specific EGFR inhibitor, all major tumor-associated phenotypes could be rescued. This form of treatment was also successful in a real treatment scenario, which means when they started after the full tumor phenotype was expressed. In conclusion, reduced protein administration can be a very promising form of adjuvant cancer therapy.",

Reducing the amount of proteins ingested from rice is an easy way to control the total intake of proteins, saving energy sources, particularly in rice-eating countries. In Japan, low-protein white rice had been developed, but the taste and function were not satisfactory for CKD patients. We reviewed the brief history of low-protein dietary therapy for renal diseases and the recent development of low-protein processed brown rice (LPBR). The new LPBR is characterized by a low-protein content, the same energy content as white rice, low potassium and phosphorus contents, and high amounts of dietary fibers, γ-oryzanol, and antioxidant activity. Dietary fibers and γ-oryzanol would stabilize intestinal microbiota and improve uremic dysbiosis and leaky gut syndrome. All these features suggest that the health benefits of LPBR extend to preventing CKD progression and enhancing the quality of life (QOL) of patients with CKD."

      "abstract": "Maternal diet during early gestation affects offspring phenotype, but it is unclear whether maternal diet during late gestation influences piglet metabolism. We evaluated the impact of two dietary protein levels in sow late gestation diet and piglet nursery diet on piglet metabolism. Diets met or exceeded the crude protein and amino acid requirements. Sows received either 12% (Lower, L) or 17% (Higher, H) crude protein (CP) during the last five weeks of gestation, and piglets received 16.5% (L) or 21% (H) CP from weaning at age 3.5 weeks. This resulted in a 2 × 2 factorial design with four sow/piglet diet treatment groups: HH and LL (match), HL and LH (mismatch). Piglet hepatic tissues were sampled and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined by RNA sequencing. At age 4.5 weeks, 25 genes were downregulated and 22 genes were upregulated in the mismatch compared to match groups. Several genes involved in catabolic pathways were upregulated in the mismatch compared to match groups, as were genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. The results show a distinct interaction effect between maternal and nursery diets, implying that sow late gestation diet could be used to optimize piglet metabolism."

However, not all incident HD patients are suitable for this approach, particularly once-weekly HD. This is the first study which reported the effectiveness of once-weekly online-hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) plus low protein diet (LPD) in incident HD patients. All stage 5 CKD patients who had chosen HD as their treatment modality at the HD center of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, with RKF ⩾ 3 mL/min calculated by renal clearance of urea and urine output ⩾ 800 mL/day, started the treatment with once-weekly OL-HDF. Dietitians advised patients to consume LPD (0.6-0.8 g/kg/day) on non-dialysis days and a regular protein diet on the dialysis day (1.2 g/kg/day). Eleven incident HD patients were enrolled in the study. The mean RKF and urine volume at baseline were 4.56 ± 2.21 mL/min and 2,019.54 ± 743.73 mL/day, respectively. After 6 and 12 months of follow-up, the mean RKF of the patients who remained in the once-weekly OL-HDF protocol were 3.82 ± 1.68 mL/min and 3.28 ± 0.95 mL/min, respectively. The median duration of once-weekly OL-HDF before transitioning to twice- or thrice-weekly OL-HDF was 7 months (3-24 months). The most common indication for stepping prescription was too low RKF. We reported that dialysis initiation in the university-based center with once-weekly OL-HDF in carefully selected incident HD patients combined with LPD under serial monitoring is practical. Further studies on the clinical benefits of once-weekly OL-HDF are still required.",

METHODS: Retrospective nationwide cohort study, from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients having undergone a first preemptive kidney transplantation between 2001 and 2017 were identified and divided into two groups according to the presence of sLPD treatment or not. The primary outcome was the time between the diagnosis of advanced CKD and transplantation. Secondary outcomes were post-transplantation adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 245 patients who received their first preemptive kidney transplantation were identified from the nationwide database; 63 of them had been on an sLPD prior to transplantation (sLPD group). The duration between the day of advanced CKD diagnosis and the day of transplantation was significantly longer in the sLPD group compared with the non-sLPD group (median duration: 345 vs. 220 days, p = 0.001). The risk of post-transplantation adverse events did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of its observational, retrospective design, this is the first study to suggest that nutritional management with sLPDs can safely delay the timing of preemptive kidney transplantation.",

We also investigated the gene or protein expression related to skeletal muscle development and intestinal amino acid transporters, and determined the major signalling associated with Lys-regulating skeletal muscle development. 1000 healthy, weights averaging 938.6 ± 6.54 g weaned rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (five replicates in each group and 40 rabbits in each replicate). These groups consisted of the normal protein group (NP group, consuming a diet containing 16.27% protein), the low protein group (LP group, 14.15%-14.19% protein) and the LP group with an addition of 0.15%, 0.3% or 0.45% Lys. The trial included 7 d of pre-feeding and 28 d of exposure to the treatment. Compared with NP diet and LP diet, LP+0.3% Lys group improved growth performance (p < 0.05), full-bore weight and half-bore weight of rabbits (p < 0.05). The LP+0.3% Lys group also resulted in a decrease in the excretion of faecal nitrogen and urinary nitrogen (FN; UN; p < 0.05), and an increase in nitrogen utilisation rate (NUR; p < 0.05). LP diet increased the mRNA expression of MSTN and WWP1, and decreased the mRNA expression of IGF1 (p < 0.05). LP diet decreased the protein expression of P-P70S6K1, P-4EBP1 and P-S6 (p < 0.05). LP+0.3% Lys group attenuated the effects of LP diet on the expression of MSTN, WWP1, IGF1, P-P70S6K1, P-4EBP1 and P-S6 (p < 0.05). LP+0.3% Lys group resulted in an increase in mRNA expression of MyoD and protein expression of P-mTOR relative to the NP and LP groups (p < 0.05). In summary, the addition of Lys to a LP diet provides a theoretical basis for the popularisation and application of Lys in rabbit production.",

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by high mortality from cardiovascular diseases, the development of which is facilitated by traditional risk factors (typical for the general population) and by nontraditional ones (specific to patients with CKD) as well. These factors include also uremic toxins, for which a causal relationship has been established with specific pathological processes in patients with CKD, comprising the development of vascular dysfunction and accelerated progression of atherosclerosis. Urea has long been considered not as a uremic toxin, but as a marker of metabolic imbalance or dialysis efficiency (Kt/V) in CKD patients. In recent years, more and more publications have appeared on the study of the toxic effects of urea with the development of toxic-uremic complications and the phenotype of premature aging, common in CKD. It was found that an increase in urea levels in uremic syndrome causes damage to the intestinal epithelial barrier with translocation of bacterial toxins into the bloodstream and the development of systemic inflammation, provokes apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as endothelial dysfunction, which directly contributes to the development of cardiovascular complications. The indirect effects of increased urea levels are associated with carbamylation reactions, when isocyanic acid (a product of urea catabolism) changes the structure and function of proteins in the body. Carbamylation of proteins in CKD patients is associated with the development of renal fibrosis, atherosclerosis and anemia. Thus, urea is now regarded as an important negative agent in the pathogenesis of complications in CKD. Studies on a low-protein diet with using ketoanalogues of essential amino acids to minimize the accumulation of urea and other uremic toxins demonstrate the clinical benefit of such an intervention in slowing the progression of CKD and the development of cardiovascular complications.",

The sedentary lifestyle in association with the consumption of protein-deficient and high-calorie diet results in IR development. This study was aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Saroglitazar (SGZ), a dual peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR-α/γ) in a high fat-low protein diet (HFLPD) fed mouse model of MetS and associated cognitive deficits. METHODS: Adult male C57BL/6J mice were fed with HFLPD plus 15% oral fructose solution for 16 weeks. Starting at the 13th week, SGZ (5 & 10 mg/kg; p.o.) was administered along with HFLPD for four weeks, i.e., the 12th to 16th week of the study groups. Various physiological, serum metabolic, neurobehavioral, neuroinflammatory, and oxidative stress parameters were assessed. The brain histopathology and mRNA expression of diverse genes in specific brain regions were also estimated. RESULTS: The treatment with SGZ at both doses have significantly reversed various HFLPD-induced metabolic and cognitive alterations by improving the glucose and lipid profile in the periphery in addition to the enhanced cerebral glucose homeostasis, BBB integrity, reduced oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the SGZ improved locomotion and memory retention while reducing the HFLPD-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the mice. CONCLUSIONS: SGZ treatment showed significant metabo-neuroprotective effects in mice fed with HFLPD, possibly through peripherally mediated activation of PPAR-α/γ and insulin downstream signaling in the cortex and hippocampus.",

METHODS: Prospective, single-center study (total duration of 15 months), enrolling 92 patients with advanced DKD (median eGFR 11.7 ml/min) and heavy proteinuria (median 4.8 g/g creatininuria). The intervention consisted in a low salt-low protein (0.6 g/kg-day) diet (sLPD) under intensive nutritional counselling, and adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. The endpoints of this sub-analysis were a salt intake ≤ 5 g/day, a mean blood pressure (MAP) ≤ 97 mmHg, corresponding to KDIGO target of 130/80 mmHg, and the rate of CVEs. RESULTS: Salt intake decreased with 2.5 g/day and the proportion of patients reaching the salt intake endpoint increased with 58%. A salt intake ≤ 5 g/day was associated with a reduced MAP, BMI, proteinuria, fractional excretion of sodium, and eGFR, suggesting a salt-related volume contraction but was not related to protein intake. Mean arterial pressure decreased with 13 mmHg. MAP ≤ 97 mmHg was associated with lower proteinuria, salt, and protein intake, but the contribution of salt intake cannot be differentiated from that of protein intake. CVEs occurred in 20% of patients and were independently related to a lower age and MAP, and increased comorbidities. eGFR only minimally declined and no renal adverse events were noted. sLPD was nutritionally safe. CONCLUSIONS: The multifactorial personalized intervention allowed a stable MAP reduction to KDIGO recommended levels (≤ 97 mmHg), related to the decrease in salt and protein intake. However, BP lower than 130/80 mmHg increased the cardiovascular but not the renal risk in heavy proteinuric patients with advanced DKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 0341507433: NCT03415074.

Despite these strong statements, low protein diets (LPDs) are not prescribed by many nephrologists worldwide. In this review, we challenge the view of protein restriction as an \"option\" in the management of patients with CKD, and defend it as a core element of care. We argue that LPDs need to be tailored and patient-centered to ensure adherence, efficacy, and safety. Nephrologists, aligned with renal dietitians, may approach the implementation of LPDs similarly to a drug prescription, considering its indications, contra-indications, mechanism of action, dosages, unwanted side effects, and special warnings. Following this framework, we discuss herein the benefits and potential harms of LPDs as a cornerstone in CKD management."

Patients are dependent on food protein labelling to successfully manage their condition. We evaluated the accuracy of protein labelling on packaged manufactured foods from supermarket websites for foods that may be eaten as part of a phenylalanine-restricted diet. Protein labelling information was evaluated for 462 food items (\"free from\", n = 159, regular, n = 303), divided into 16 food groups using supermarket website data. Data collection included protein content per portion/100 g when food was \"as sold\", \"cooked\" or \"prepared\"; cooking methods, and preparation instructions. Labelling errors affecting protein content were observed in every food group, with overall protein labelling unclear in 55% (n = 255/462) of foods. There was misleading, omitted, or erroneous (MOE) information in 43% (n = 68/159) of \"free from\" foods compared with 62% (n = 187/303) of regular foods, with fewer inaccuracies in \"free from\" food labelling (p = 0.007). Protein analysis was available for uncooked weight only but not cooked weight for 58% (n = 85/146) of foods; 4% (n = 17/462) had misleading protein content. There was a high rate of incomplete, misleading, or inaccurate data affecting the interpretation of the protein content of food items on supermarket websites. This could adversely affect metabolic control of patients with PKU and warrants serious consideration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that dietary therapy can delay the initiation of dialysis, but little research has investigated whether patients with very poor renal function would benefit from a dietary therapy. METHODS: This study was performed by using the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD), which is based on the largest medical system in Taiwan. Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 between 2001 and 2015 with more than 3 months of low-protein diet supplemented with ketoanalogues (sLPD) were extracted (Ketosteril group). We then assigned five patients without any sLPD to match one patient of the Ketosteril group (comparison group). Both groups were followed up for 1 year for the initiation of dialysis and rates of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). RESULTS: The Ketosteril group (n = 547), compared with the comparison group (n = 2735), exhibited a lower incidence of new-onset dialysis (40.2% vs. 44.4%, subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR): 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70-0.91) and MACCEs (3.7% vs. 5.9%, HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.97). The beneficial effect of an sLPD did not differ in patients with a baseline eGFR < 5 mL/min/1.73 m2. CONCLUSION: Even among patients with extremely low eGFR, sLPD treatment can safely delay the need for dialysis.",

The study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with medium-chain fatty acid glyceride on the growth performance and intestinal health of weaned piglets fed with a low-protein diet. Nighty healthy weaned piglets were randomly divided into five treatments: NP (Normal protein treatment, normal-protein diet no antibiotics included); NC (Negative control, low-protein diet no antibiotics included); PC (Positive control, low-protein diet +75 mg/kg quinocetone, 20 mg/kg virginiamycin and 50 mg/kg aureomycin); MCT (tricaprylin + tricaprin treatment, low-protein diet + tricaprylin + tricaprin); GML (glycerol monolaurate treatment, low-protein diet + glycerol monolaurate). The results showed that the average daily feed intake (ADFI) of the MCT treatment was significantly higher than that of the NP, NC treatments (p < 0.05). In the jejunum, the villus height of the GML treatment was significantly lower than that of the PC treatment (p < 0.05), and the number of goblet cells in the GML treatment was higher than that in the NC treatment (p < 0.05). Compared with the NC treatment, the MCT treatment significantly increased the level of claudin-1, Zonula occludens-1(ZO-1), while the GML treatment significantly increased the level of claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1 (p < 0.05). In the ileum, the level of ZO-1 in the GML treatment was significantly higher than that in the NP, NC, PC treatments (p < 0.05). Compared with the NC treatment, the GML treatment significantly increased the level of Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in the ileum and serum, while the MCT treatment significantly increased the level of SIgA and decreased the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the ileum (p < 0.05). These results showed that the addition of medium-chain fatty acid glycerides to a low-protein diet could improve the growth performance and intestinal functional barrier of weaned piglets and also improve the immune function of weaned piglets."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred one-day-old broiler chicks were randomly allotted into three treatment groups, with five replicates per treatment and 20 broiler chickens per replicate. The three experimental diets were formulated with different dietary crude protein (CP) %, (control [CON] and CON with 1% [CP-1%] or 2% [CP-2%] less CP units) during the starter, grower, and finisher phases. The CP of the experimental diets were 22, 21, and 20% for the starting period (day 1-14); 20, 19, and 18% CP for the growing period (day 15-28); and 18, 17, and 16% CP for the finishing period (day 29-35) in CON, CP-1%, and CP-2%, respectively. The low-CP diets (CP-1% and CP-2%) were supplemented with combined AA, threonine+tryptophan+valine, to meet the respective levels of the CON diet. RESULTS: The CP-2% group had greater (p<0.05; linear, p<0.05) final body weight and gain and better feed conversion ratio. The combined AA inclusion in the low-CP diet (CP-1% and CP-2%) increased (p<0.001; linear, p<0.001) carcass and breast meat yield as well as CP% of breast meat. The reduction of CP% with AA supplementation (CP-2%) decreased (p<0.05; linear, p<0.05) serum triglycerides, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase, while increased (p<0.01; linear, p<0.01) phagocytic activity and phagocytic index. The mRNA expression of splenic and cecal tonsil interleukin 4 and interferon gamma was upregulated (p<0.001; linear, p<0.001) in the low-CP diets supplemented with AA (CP-1% and CP-2%). Dietary supplementation with AA to low-protein diets improved (p<0.01; linear, p<0.01) the economic returns of broiler chickens. CONCLUSION: A reduction of dietary CP and increased synthetic AA such as threonine, valine, and tryptophan should be considered to improve performance, health, and immunity in broiler chickens."

In our previous study, we found that supplementation with low concentration of ouabain during pregnancy could restore glomerulus numbers at birth, rescuing kidney development. However, the metabolic pattern of kidney in IUGR offspring and the effect of ouabain have not been evaluated. MAIN METHODS: In this study, based on GC-MS and LC-MS platforms, we used the protein restriction rat model to explore the molecular mechanisms of kidney damage induced by IUGR and the protective effect of ouabain. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that malnutrition could induce IUGR in rat offspring at the 20th gestational day but ouabain treatment could partially reverse the body and kidney weight loss. Ouabain treatment could upregulate arginine, N-acetylornithine and carbamoyl phosphate as well as adenine nucleotide and guanine nucleotide downregulated by low-protein diet. Moreover, six metabolites were identified to be significantly correlated with fetal kidney weight, with 3 metabolites involved in arginine metabolism (arginine, N-acetylornithine, urea) and UDP-glucuronate correlated positively, while lysine and anthranilate correlated negatively. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggested that the underlying mechanism of ouabain against renal maldevelopment involved the metabolic regulation, particularly the arginine metabolism, which played an important role in the development of fetal kidney.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming increasingly prevalent and nutrition intervention remains the most important therapeutic approach for NAFLD. Our aim was to investigate whether low- (LP) or high-protein (HP) diets are more effective in reducing liver fat and reversing NAFLD and which mechanisms are involved. METHODS: 19 participants with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery were randomized into two hypocaloric (1500-1600 kcal/day) diet groups, a low protein (10E% protein) and a high protein (30E% protein), for three weeks prior to surgery. Intrahepatic lipid levels (IHL) and serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) were measured before and after the dietary intervention. Autophagy flux, histology, mitochondrial activity and gene expression analyses were performed in liver samples collected during surgery. RESULTS: IHL levels decreased by 42.6% in the HP group, but were not significantly changed in the LP group despite similar weight loss. Hepatic autophagy flux and serum FGF21 increased by 66.7% and 42.2%, respectively, after 3 weeks in the LP group only. Expression levels of fat uptake and lipid biosynthesis genes were lower in the HP group compared with those in the LP group. RNA-seq analysis revealed lower activity of inflammatory pathways upon HP diet. Hepatic mitochondrial activity and expression of β-oxidation genes did not increase in the HP group. CONCLUSIONS: HP diet more effectively reduces hepatic fat than LP diet despite of lower autophagy and FGF21. Our data suggest that liver fat reduction upon HP diets result primarily from suppression of fat uptake and lipid biosynthesis.",

Aim: We tested how a low-protein diet (LPD)-with or without oral inulin supplementation as a prebiotic-modulates some inflammatory, atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction indices and nutritional markers, as well as psychocognitive functions in CKD patients. We conducted a prospective, case-control study on CKD patients on conservative therapy, divided in two groups: the intervention group treated with LPD (0.6 g/kg/day) plus inulin (19 g/day) and a control group treated with LPD without inulin, for six consecutive months. Clinical and hematochemical parameters as well as instrumental, and psychocognitive assessments (by SF-36 survey and MMSE, HAM-D, BDI-II) were recorded in all the participants at baseline (T0), at three months (T1) and at six months (T2). A total of 41 patients were enrolled: 18 in the intervention group and 23 in the control group. At T2, in both groups, we observed a significant reduction of serum nitrogen and phosphorus (p ≤ 0.01) and serum uric acid (p ≤ 0.03), and an improvement in metabolic acidosis (bicarbonates, p ≤ 0.01; base excess, p ≤ 0.02). Moreover, at T2 the intervention group showed a reduction in serum insulin (p = 0.008) and fasting glucose levels (p = 0.022), HOMA-IR (p = 0.004), as well as lower total serum cholesterol (p = 0.012), triglycerides (p = 0.016), C-reactive protein (p = 0.044) and homocysteine (p = 0.044) and higher HDL (p < 0.001) with respect to baseline. We also observed a significant amelioration of some quality of life and functional status indices (SF-36 survey) among the intervention group compared to controls, without a significant improvement in the cognitive state (MMSE). On the other hand, an amelioration in mood (by HAM-D and BDI-II) was found in the intervention group and in controls (only by BID-II). In conclusion, LPD in association with oral inulin supplementation improved glycemic and lipid metabolism and ameliorated the systemic inflammatory state, likely reducing cardiovascular risk in CKD patients and this may represent a promising therapeutic option, also improving quality of life and mood.",

In the current study, we used a mouse maternal low-protein diet fed either for the duration of pregnancy (LPD) or exclusively during the preimplantation period (Emb-LPD) with control nutrition provided thereafter and postnatally to investigate effects on fetal bone development and quality. This model has been shown previously to induce cardiometabolic and neurological disease phenotypes in offspring. Micro 3D computed tomography examination at fetal stages Embryonic day E14.5 and E17.4, reflecting early and late stages of bone formation, demonstrated LPD treatment caused increased bone formation of relative high mineral density quality in males, but not females, at E14.5, disproportionate to fetal growth, with bone quality maintained at E17.5. In contrast, Emb-LPD caused a late increase in male fetal bone growth, proportionate to fetal growth, at E17.5, affecting central and peripheral skeleton and of reduced mineral density quality relative to controls. These altered dynamics in bone growth coincide with increased placental efficiency indicating compensatory responses to dietary treatments. Overall, our data show fetal bone formation and mineral quality is dependent upon maternal nutritional protein content and is sex-specific. In particular, we find the duration and timing of poor maternal diet to be critical in the outcomes with periconceptional protein restriction leading to male offspring with increased bone growth but of poor mineral density, thereby susceptible to later disease risk.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the consequences of dietary levels of crude protein (CP) and total sulfur amino acids (TSAA, Met+Cys) on productive performance, egg quality and egg components for Lohmann Brown laying hens through 18-34 weeks of age. A 2×3 factorial design experiment was conducted using two levels of CP (16 and 18 %) and three levels of Met+ Cys (0.67, 0.72 and 0.77 %). A total of 144 Lohmann Brown laying hens at 18 weeks of age were randomly divided into 6 treatment groups. The best values of final body weight and body weight change were recorded by the hens fed 18 % CP diet. Increasing dietary CP up to 18 % accompanied with the best (P> 0.01) feed conversion, egg weight and egg mass. The combination between low-CP diet (16 %) and 0.72 % Met+ Cys gave the best percentage of egg production. The majority of egg quality traits were not significantly altered by dietary treatments. The interaction between CP and Met+Cys levels had a statistical (P>0.01) impact on egg content of moisture and total solids only. It could be concluded that the best production criteria could be obtained by using 0.72% Met+Cys. Moreover, dietary level of 16 or 18 % CP with 0.72% Met+Cys is recommended for feeding Lohmann hens.",

Three hundred eighty-four one-day-old male broilers (Ross 308) were randomly allotted to groups that received one of 6 dietary treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement (i.e., 2 environmental conditions and 3 dietary treatments) to give 8 replicates per treatment. Broilers were challenged with 2 environmental conditions (sanitary vs. poor sanitary). The dietary treatments were (1) high protein (HP) diet, (2) LP diet, and (3) LP diet with synthetic key essential AA (LPA): the LP diet was supplemented with synthetic AA up to the required levels for broilers. On day 14, birds consumed the LP diet impaired growth performance compared with those fed the HP diet, while the average daily weight gain-to-feed conversion ratio of birds fed the LPA diet improved to the level of birds fed the HP diet under poor sanitary conditions (P < 0.05). Broilers raised under poor sanitary conditions and fed the LP diet displayed higher (P < 0.05) zonula occludens (ZO-1) expression on day 14 than broilers fed either the HP or LPA diet. Under sanitary conditions, birds fed HP and LPA diets showed higher villus height and crypt depth compared with those of broilers fed the LP diet on day 35. Moreover, broilers raised in the poor sanitary environment had higher (P < 0.05) serum endotoxins than those raised in the sanitary environment. Broilers fed the LPA diet showed reduced (P < 0.05) nitrogen excretion on days 14 and 35 compared with those fed the LP and HP diets independent of the environment. In conclusion, the LPA diet did not impair growth performance under poor sanitary conditions for 14 D after hatch while resulting in lower nitrogen excretion in any environment conditions throughout the experiment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The gut microbiota has coevolved with humans for a mutually beneficial coexistence and plays an important role in health and disease. A dysbiotic gut microbiome may contribute to progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD-related complications such as cardiovascular disease. Microbiota modulation through the administration of prebiotics may represent an important therapeutic target. AIM: We sought to evaluate the effects of a low-protein diet (LPD) (0.6 g/kg/day) with or without the intake of the prebiotic inulin (19 g/day) on microbiota and clinical parameters in CKD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a longitudinal, prospective, controlled, and interventional study on 16 patients: 9 patients treated with LPD (0.6 g/kg/day) and inulin (19 g/day) and 7 patients (control group) treated only with LPD (0.6 g/kg/day). Clinical evaluations were performed and fecal samples were collected for a subsequent evaluation of the intestinal microbiota in all patients. These tests were carried out before the initiation of LPD, with or without inulin, at baseline (T0) and at 6 months (T2). The microbiota of 16 healthy control (HC) subjects was also analyzed in order to identify potential dysbiosis between patients and healthy subjects. RESULTS: Gut microbiota of CKD patients was different from that of healthy controls. The LPD was able to significantly increase the frequencies of Akkermansiaceae and Bacteroidaceae and decrease the frequencies of Christensenellaceae, Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Pasteurellaceae. Only Bifidobacteriaceae were increased when the LPD was accompanied by oral inulin intake. We showed a significant reduction of serum uric acid (SUA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients treated with LPD and inulin (p = 0.018 and p = 0.003, respectively), an improvement in SF-36 (physical role functioning and general health perceptions; p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively), and a significant increase of serum bicarbonate both in patients treated with LPD (p = 0.026) or with LPD and inulin (p = 0.01). Moreover, in patients treated with LPD and inulin, we observed a significant reduction in circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (p = 0.041) and plasma nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) (p = 0.027) levels. We did not find a significant difference in the circulating levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β (p = 0.529) and IL-6 (p = 0.828) in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: LPD, associated or not with inulin, modified gut microbiota and modulated inflammatory and metabolic parameters in patients with CKD. Our results suggest that interventions attempting to modulate the gut microbiome may represent novel strategies to improve clinical outcomes in CKD patients and may provide useful therapeutic effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of diet on the occurrence of proximal reflux episodes at the multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring (MII-pH) in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). METHODS: Patients with LPR symptoms and findings were recruited from three European hospitals. The LPR diagnostic was confirmed through MII-pH and patients were benefited from gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Regarding the types of reflux at the MII-pH (acid, nonacid, mixed), patients received a 3 month-therapy based on the association of alkaline, low-fat and high-protein diet, proton pump inhibitors, alginate or magaldrate. Reflux symptom score (RSS) and reflux sign assessment (RSA) were used to evaluate laryngeal and extra-laryngeal symptoms and findings from pretreatment to posttreatment. The Global Refluxogenic Score (GRES) was used to assess the refluxogenic potential of the diet of the patients at baseline and posttreatment. The relationship between GRES severity; the MII-pH findings; GI endoscopy; and the therapeutic response was explored through multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Eighty-five LPR patients were included. The mean GRES significantly improved from pretreatment (50.7 ± 23.8) to posttreatment (27.3 ± 23.2; P = 0.001). Similarly, RSS and RSA significantly improved from baseline to posttreatment. The baseline GRES was significantly associated with the occurrence of proximal reflux episodes at the MII-pH (P = 0.001). Trends were found regarding the association between GRES and the occurrence of esophagitis (P = 0.06) and between hiatal hernia and DeMeester score (P = 0.06). There was a significant and strong association between the concomitant respect of diet and medication and the improvement of RSS (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The consumption of high-fat, low-protein, high-sugar, acid foods, and beverages is associated with a higher number of proximal reflux episodes at the MII-pH, according to the global refluxogenic score of LPR patients.",

It has been used for years and it has new goals today, such as (1) the reduction of edema, diuretics, and blood pressure values with a low sodium-content diet; (2) the dose reduction of phosphate levels and phosphate binders; (3) the administration of bicarbonate with vegetables in order to correct metabolic acidosis and delay CKD progression; (4) the reduction of the number and the doses of drugs and chemical substances; and (5) the lowering of urea levels, the cure of intestinal microbioma, and the reduction of cyanates levels (such as indoxyl-sulphate and p-cresol sulphate), which are the most recent known advantages achievable with NT. In conclusion, NT and especially very low protein diet (VLPD) have several beneficial effects in CKD patients and slows the progression of CKD."

In the present study, we investigated changes in body weight, plasma insulin levels, BCM and islet number in mice fed HSTD for 5 weeks followed by normal chow (NC) for 2 weeks. BCM and islet number were increased in mice fed HSTD for 5 weeks compared with those in mice fed NC. On the other hand, mice fed HSTD for 5 weeks followed by NC for 2 weeks (SN) showed decreased BCM and insulin levels, compared to mice fed HSTD for 7 weeks, and no significant differences in these parameters were observed between SN and the control NC at 7 weeks. No significant difference in body weight was observed among HSTD, NC and SN fed groups. These results suggest that a high-starch diet induces an increase in BCM in a manner independent of body weight gain, and that 2 weeks of NC feeding is sufficient for the reversal of the morphological changes induced in islets by HSTD feeding.",

The gut microbiome (GM) responds to both diet and exercise and may influence host metabolism. This study compared the cecal GM after a 13.5-week intervention study in mice on a variety of dietary interventions ± concurrent voluntary exercise training in activity wheels. The diets included chronic chow diet, LPHC diet, 40 E% high protein-low carbohydrate (HPLC) diet, an obesigenic chronic high-fat diet (HFD) and the pLPHC diet. Our hypothesis was that the GM changes with pLPHC diet would generally reflect the improved metabolic health of the host and interact with concurrent exercise training. The GM analyses revealed greater abundance phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Akkermansia on chronic and periodized LPHC and higher abundance of Oscillospira and Oscillibacter on HFD. The differences in diet-induced GM correlated strongly with the differences in a range of host metabolic health-measures. In contrast, no significant effect of concurrent exercise training was observed. In conclusion, pLPHC diet elicits substantial changes in the GM. In contrast, only subtle and non-significant effects of concurrent activity wheel exercise were observed. The pLPHC-associated microbiome may contribute to the healthier host phenotype observed in these mice."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE(S): Low protein diets (LPD; 0.6 g/kg/day), prescribed for nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, have demonstrated numerous benefits. LPDs may modulate inflammation and oxidative stress through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which encodes antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzymes. LPDs also inhibit or antagonize nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activity, which orchestrates inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of LPD on Nfr2 and NF-κB messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in nondialysis CKD patients. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, a LPD was prescribed for 30 nondialysis CKD patients for 6 months. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to evaluate Nrf2, NF-κB, and NADPH quinine oxidoreductase-1 mRNA expression. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, were also evaluated. RESULTS: (Age 55.5 ± 14.0 years; body mass index 29.1 ± 5.9 kg/m2; glomerular filtration rate 35.6 ± 12.2 mL/minute). After 6 months of nutritional intervention, Nrf2 mRNA expression increased from 0.85 (0.47-1.56) to 1.28 (0.63-2.63) nmol/mL (P = .03), and TBARS levels were significantly decreased from 1.78 (1.31-2.38) to 1.30 (1.07-2.22) nmol/mL (P = .04). NF-κB mRNA expression showed no significant difference after 6 months, but the Nrf2/NF-κB ratio was increased. CONCLUSION(S): In this study, a LPD appeared to modulate Nrf2 expression and decrease the levels of TBARS in nondialysis CKD patients. However, more studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of LPD on the modulation of transcription factors involved with oxidative stress and inflammation in nondialysis CKD patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A very low protein diet (VLPD) with ketoacid analogs of essential amino acids (KA/EAA) administration can remarkably influence protein synthesis and metabolic disturbances of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), and may also slow the decline in renal function. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out to monitor renal progression and metabolic and nutritional status among 140 patients with CKD stage III or IV. One group (n = 70) was on a low protein diet (LPD) with 0.6 g of protein intake, and another group (n = 70) was on a VLPD with 0.3 g of protein and KA/EAA supplementation of 100 mg/kg/day for 12 months. RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) significantly decreased from 41.6 ± 10.2 to 36.4 ± 8.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P < 0.001) and urine protein increased from 0.6 ± 0.5 to 0.9 ± 1.1 g/day (P = 0.017) in the LPD group, but no significant changes in estimated GFR and urine protein were found in the VLPD plus KA/EAA group. A significant mean difference in rate of change in estimated GFR (-5.2 ± 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year; P < 0.001) was observed between the two groups. After Cox regression analysis, treatment with VLPD plus KA/EAA significantly protected against the incidence of declining GFR > 10% annually (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.79; P = 0.006) and significant correlations were found between using VLPD plus KA/EEA and increased GFR. CONCLUSION: VLPD supplementation with KA/EAA is associated with delayed renal progression while preserving the nutritional status in the patients with CKD. Co-administration of VLPD and KA/EAA may prove an effective alternative to conservative management of CKD."

      "abstract": "The occurrence of inflammation and protein malnutrition is an aggravating risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the clinical setting. The green propolis, a natural product made by Apis mellifera bees from Baccharis dracunculifolia resin, has therapeutic potential to modulate chronic inflammation. However, its effect on inflammation in an impaired nutritional status is not known. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of the administration of the hydroalcoholic extract of the green propolis in the chronic inflammatory process of mice submitted to a low-protein diet. For this, we used the subcutaneous implantation of sponge disks as an inflammatory model and the animals were distributed in the following groups: standard protein diet (12% protein content), control treatment; standard protein diet, propolis treatment; low-protein diet (3% protein content), control treatment; low-protein diet, propolis treatment. Propolis was given daily at a dose of 500 mg/kg (p.o.) during a period of 7 or 15 days. Our main findings show that animals fed with standard protein diet and treated with propolis had low levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, with the subsequent reestablishment of these levels, in addition to monocyte count elevation and higher TNF levels after one week of treatment. In the low-protein diet group, the propolis treatment provided a significant recovery in weight and maintenance of total serum protein levels at the end of two weeks of treatment. Histological analysis showed propolis reduced the inflammatory infiltrate in the sponges of both standard and low-protein diet groups. In addition, the propolis extract presented antiangiogenic effect in both groups. Therefore, our data suggests that the hydroalcoholic extract of the green propolis promotes weight recovery and avoid the reduction of protein levels, in addition to inhibit inflammation and angiogenesis in animals fed with a low-protein diet.",

However, evidence regarding its effect on long-term survival is limited. Our study assessed the long-term outcomes of patients on an sLPD after commencing dialysis. METHODS: This retrospective study examined patients with new-onset end-stage renal disease with permanent dialysis between 2001 and 2013, extracted from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients who received more than 3 months of sLPD treatment in the year preceding the start of dialysis were extracted. The outcomes studied were all-cause mortality, infection rate, and major cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the sLPD group (n = 2607) showed a lower risk of all-cause mortality (23.1% vs. 27.6%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70⁻0.84), MACCEs (19.2% vs. 21.5%, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78⁻0.94), and infection-related death (9.9% vs. 12.5%, HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67⁻0.87) than the non-sLPD group did. CONCLUSION: We found that sLPD treatment might be safe without long-term negative consequences after dialysis treatment.",

Low-protein diets supplemented with ketoacids and essential aminoacids have proved effective at different CKD stages. AIM: to assess the progression of renal failure in adult patients with CKD stages 3b and 4 receiving a protein-controlled diet supplemented with aminoacids and ketoanalogues. METHODS: retrospective, descriptive intervention study. The nutritional intervention consisted of a protein/calorie intake of 0.4-0.6 g/kg/day and 30-35 kcal/kg/day plus a tablet of ketoanalogues (Ketosteril®)/5 kg weight. We assessed nutritional condition, glomerular filtration (GF) and creatinine, urea and albumin levels at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. SPSS version 18 was used for data statistical analysis. RESULTS: thirty-three patients were studied (67% male; mean age 59.7 years, r: 24-87). Protein/calorie intake was 0.55 ± 0.20 g/kg/day and 34 ± 4.51 kcal/kg/day. Ketosteril® intake was 11.87 tablets/day (r: 9-14). Initial GF was 24.97 ± 6.64 ml/min/1.73 m2, showing a significant increase between three and 12 months (25.51 ± 8.57 and 29.26 ± 10.33 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.006). Urea nitrogen decreased significantly at six months compared with the initial level (p < 0.005). Body mass index did not change significantly (initial, 26. 63 ± 4.08 kg/m2; after a year, 26.78 ± 3.98 kg/m2). Initial and final albumin levels were 3.53 ± 0.64 g/l and 4.00 ± 0.53 g/l, respectively (p = 0.79). CONCLUSION: a low-protein diet supplemented with ketoanalogues administered to patients with CKD stages 3b and 4 preserved nutritional condition and mineral balance, improved GF significantly and decreased urea levels.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low protein diet (LPD) on the lipid and anthropometric profile in non-dialysis CKD patients. METHODS: Forty CKD patients were studied (20 men, 62.7 ± 15.2 years, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 26.16 ± 9.4 mL/min/1.73m2). LPD (0.6g/kg/d) was prescribed for six months and, biochemical and anthropometric parameters like body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and body fat mass (assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry - DXA) were evaluated before and after six months with LPD. RESULTS: After six months of nutritional intervention, patients presented reduction on BMI (from 28.1 ± 5.6 to 27.0 ± 5.3 Kg/m2, p = 0.001), total cholesterol (from 199.7 ± 57.1 to 176.0 ± 43.6mg/dL, p = 0.0001), LDL (from 116.2 ± 48.1 to 97.4 ± 39.1 mg/dL, p = 0,001) and uric acid (from 6.8 ± 1.4 to 6.2 ± 1.3 mg/dL, p = 0.004). In addition, GFR values were increased from 26.2 ± 9.5 to 28.9 ± 12.7mL/min (p = 0.02). The energy, proteins, cholesterol and fiber intake were reduced significantly. CONCLUSION: LPD prescribe to non-dialysis CKD patients for six months was able to improve some cardiovascular risk factors as overweight and plasma lipid profile, suggesting that LPD can be also an important tool for protection against cardiovascular diseases in these patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A low-protein diet (LPD) is believed to be beneficial in slowing the progression of kidney disease. It is reported that low protein diet can improve protein, sugar and lipid metabolism, and reduce the symptoms and complications of renal insufficiency. However, there has been controversial regarding the effects of protein restriction on diabetic nephropathy (DN). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of LPD on renal function in patients with type 1 or 2 DN by meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DESIGN: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched. Eleven randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 10 were English and 1 was Chinese. The primary outcome was a change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The secondary outcome was a change in proteinuria. Random-effects models were used to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Our research indicated that LPD was not associated with a significant improvement in GFR (1.59 ml · min-1 · 1.73 m-2, 95% CI -0.57, 3.75, I2 = 76%; p = 0.15). This effect was consistent across the subgroups regardless of type of diabetes, course of diabetes and intervention period. Our results also showed that there was no significant difference on improvement of proteinuria in patients of LPD and those in normal-protein diet groups (- 0.48, 95%CI-1.70, 0.74, I2 = 94%, p = 0.44). Subgroup analysis revealed that LPD resulted in increased excretion of proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes (1.32, 95% CI 0.17, 2.47, I2 = 86%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The present research showed that LPD was not significantly associated with improvement of renal function in patients with either type 1 or 2 diabetic nephropathy. Although these results do not completely eliminate the possibility that LPD is beneficial for patients with diabetic nephropathy, it does not seem to be significant benefit to renal function.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a maternal low-protein diet on proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and RAS components in kidney samples isolated from adult male offspring. We hypothesized that post-weaning losartan treatment would have beneficial effects on RAS activity and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in these animals. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a control (20% casein) or low-protein diet (LP) (6% casein) throughout gestation. After weaning, the LP pups were randomly assigned to LP and LP-losartan groups (AT1 receptor blockade: 10 mg/kg/day until 20 weeks of age). At 20 weeks of age, blood pressure levels were higher and renal RAS was activated in the LP group. We also observed several adverse effects in the kidneys of the LP group, including a higher number of CD3, CD68 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells and higher levels of collagen and reactive oxygen species in the kidney. Further, our results revealed that post-weaning losartan treatment completely abolished immune cell infiltration and intrarenal RAS activation in the kidneys of LP rats. The prevention of augmentation of angiotensin (Ang II) concentration abolished inflammatory and fibrotic events, indicating that Ang II via the AT1 receptor is essential for pathological initiation. Our results suggest that the prenatal programming of hypertension is dependent on the up-regulation of local RAS and presence of immune cells in the kidney.",

      "abstract": "A low-protein diet (LPD) can be expected to retard renal function decline in advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and is recommended in a clinical setting. Regarding the molecular mechanisms of an LPD against DKD, previous animal studies have shown that an LPD exerts reno-protection through mainly the improvement of glomerular hyperfiltration/hypertension due to the reduction of intraglomerular pressure. On the other hand, we have demonstrated that an LPD, particularly a very-LPD (VLPD), improved tubulo-interstitial damage, inflammation and fibrosis, through the restoration of autophagy via the reduction of a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in type 2 diabetes and obesity animal models. Thus, based on animal studies, a VLPD may show a more beneficial effect against advanced DKD. Previous clinical reports have also shown that a VLPD, not a moderate LPD, slows the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic glomerular nephritis. However, there is insufficient clinical data regarding the beneficial effects of a VLPD against DKD. Additionally, the patients with CKD, including DKD, are a high-risk group for malnutrition, such as protein⁻energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, and frailty. Therefore, an LPD, including a VLPD, should be prescribed to patients when the benefits of an LPD outweigh the risks, upon consideration of adherence, age, and nutritional status. As the future predicts, the development of a VLPD replacement therapy without malnutrition may be expected for reno-protection against the advanced stages of DKD, through the regulation of mTORC1 activity and adequate autophagy induction. However, further studies to elucidate detailed mechanisms by which a VLPD exerts reno-protection are necessary.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the post-ruminal effects of feeding ruminants different concentrations of rumen-protected methionine (RPM) in low crude protein diets using the long-term rumen simulation method (Rusitec) followed by in vitro abomasum and ileum digestibility technique. The experiment contained four treatment groups: (1) high protein, without RPM supplementation (HP); (2) low protein, without RPM supplementation (LP); (3) low protein supplementation with low RPM (LPLM); and (4) low protein supplementation with high RPM (LPHM) mixed per 20 ± 0.04 g basal diet in every fermenter. The results showed that the LPLM and LPHM groups had significantly higher disappearance of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber in the abomasum and ileum than the HP treatment (P < 0.05) and were the same as the LP group (P > 0.05). The proportions of short-chain fatty acids and total volatile fatty acids in the abomasum and ileum were the same between the LPHM and HP groups (P > 0.05); however, the LPLM group was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the HP group and similar to the LP group (P > 0.05). Rusitec pH before or after changing feed bags and daily ammonia nitrogen production in the abomasum and ileum were non significantly (P > 0.05) different among all groups. In conclusion, RPM supplementation with low crude protein diets promoted post-ruminal digestibility and production of volatile fatty acids."

Folate supplementation has been shown to rescue the offspring from various programming effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether folate supplementation during pregnancy reverses LP-induced GI and IR. METHODS: Pregnant rats were fed control (20% protein), isocaloric low-protein (LP, 6%) or LP with 5 mg/kg folate (LPF) diets from gestational day 4 to delivery. The control diet was given during lactation and to pups after weaning. Glucose tolerance test was done at 1, 2, and 3 mo of age followed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp at 4 mo. Rats were sacrificed at 4 mo and their gonadal, renal, inguinal, brown fat, and pancreas were weighed and expressed relative to their body weight. RESULTS: LP- and LPF-fed dams showed similar weight loss during late pregnancy after decreased feed intake. Both LP and LPF pups were smaller at birth but their weights caught up like that of controls by 3 mo. In males, folate supplementation reduced LP-induced GI at 2 mo (glucose area under the curve [AUC]: 1940 mmol/L × 180 min in LP, 1629 mmol/L × 180 min in LPF, and 1653 mmol/L × 180 min in controls; P <0.05, LP versus control and P <0.01, LP versus LPF) but the effect diminished at 3 mo. In females, folate reduced GI at 1 mo (glucose AUC: 1406 mmol/L × 180 min in LP, 1264 mmol/L × 180 min in LPF, and 1281 mmol/L × 180 min in controls; P <0.05, LP versus control and LP versus LPF) but had no effect at 2 and 3 mo. Interestingly, the LPF group had higher pancreatic weights than other groups, suggesting that folate helps in pancreatic development enabling the LPF rats to produce/secrete more insulin to maintain euglycemia. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp shows both LP and LPF are insulin resistant compared with controls by 4 mo with LPF more severe than LP in males. Interestingly, females were more insulin resistant than males. CONCLUSIONS: Folate treatment partially reverses LP-induced GI and the magnitude of reversal is age and sex dependent. Furthermore, folate treatment does not reverse IR in either sex but makes it worse in males at 4 mo. The present study demonstrated that folate treatment is not sufficient to rescue the LP programming effects.",

      "abstract": "Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses provide complementary information about the usefulness of therapies. While intention-to-treat analyses of trials that tested low-protein diets remain debated, per-protocol analyses of the same trials show that low protein intake actually reduces the risk of kidney failure. Per-protocol analyses are notoriously open to bias but intention-to-treat analyses are less immaculate than commonly realized because they critically depend on adherence to the treatment being tested and therefore may not be directly relevant for informing clinical decisions when different degrees of adherence to therapy occur. Over the last 20 years new statistical techniques censoring patients at the time when they become uncompliant and that adjust for confounding attributable to incomplete adherence, i.e. for prognostic factors that predict adherence to treatment, have been developed. These techniques can be usefully applied to reanalyse the Modification Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and other trials. Intensive surveillance of patients on a low-protein diet is fundamental for early detection of malnutrition. However, the resources demanded by such surveillance are likely superior to the actual dietitians workforce dedicated to follow-up of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. Surveillance efforts may perhaps be preferentially devoted to preselected patients, i.e. patients that maintain good compliance and an adequate metabolic and nutritional status, while patients who are resistant to educational efforts and show persisting uncompliance may be reallocated to a diet with a higher protein content, which poses a lower risk of malnutrition and other adverse health outcomes.",

DESIGN AND METHODS: Longitudinal study with 30 nondialysis CKD patients (stage 3-4) undergoing LPD for 6 months. Adherence to the diet was evaluated based on the calculation of protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance from the 24-hour urine analysis. Good adherence to LPD was considered when protein intake was from 90% to 110% of the prescribed amount (0.6 g/kg/day). Food intake was analyzed by the 24-hour recall method. The anthropometric, biochemical and lipid profile parameters were measured according to standard methods. Uremic toxin serum levels (indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, indole-3-acetic acid) were obtained by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Fecal samples were collected to evaluate the gut microbiota profile through polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS 23.0 program software. RESULTS: Patients who adhered to the diet (n = 14) (0.7 ± 0.2 g/kg/day) presented an improvement in renal function (nonsignificant) and reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (183.9 ± 48.5-155.7 ± 37.2 mg/dL, P = .01; 99.4 ± 41.3-76.4 ± 33.2 mg/dL, P = .01, respectively). After 6 months of nutricional intervention, p-cresyl sulfate serum levels were reduced significantly in patients who adhered to the LPD (19.3 [9.6-24.7] to 15.5 [9.8-24.1] mg/L, P = .03), and in contrast, the levels were increased in patients who did not adhere (13.9 [8.0-24.8] to 24.3 [8.1-39.2] mg/L, P = .004). In addition, using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique, it was observed change in the intestinal microbiota profile after LPD intervention in both groups, and the number of bands was positively associated with protein intake (r = 0.44, P = .04). CONCLUSION: LPD seems be a good strategy to reduce the uremic toxins production by the gut microbiota in nondialysis CKD patients.",

We aimed to investigate the effect of the low-protein diets (LPD) supplemented with ketoacids (LPD+KA) in KKAy mice, an early type 2 DN model. KKAy mice were treated with normal protein diet (NPD), LPD or LPD+KA from 12 to 24 weeks of age. A period of 12-week treatment with LPD significantly reduced albuminuria as compared with that observed after NPD treatment. Treatment with LPD+KA further reduced albuminuria as compared with that observed with LPD treatment alone. Moreover, LPD treatment reduced mesangial expansion, thickness of glomerular basement membrane and the severity of the podocyte foot process effacement in KKAy mice; these effects were more pronounced in KKAy mice treated with LPD+KA. Both LPD and LPD+KA treatments slightly reduced total body weight, but had no significant effect on kidney weight and blood glucose concentrations when compared with NPD-treated KKAy mice. LPD treatment slightly attenuated oxidative stress in kidneys as compared with that observed in NPD-treated KKAy mice; however, LPD+KA treatment remarkably ameliorated oxidative stress in diabetic kidneys as shown by decreased malondialdehyde concentrations, protein carbonylation, nitrotyrosine expression and increased superoxide dismutase expression. Nutritional therapy using LPD+KA confers additional renal benefits as compared with those of LPD treatment alone in early type 2 DN through inhibition of oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent data pose the question whether conservative management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by means of a low-protein diet can be a safe and effective means to avoid or defer transition to dialysis therapy without causing protein-energy wasting or cachexia. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse the controlled clinical trials with adequate participants in each trial, providing rigorous contemporary evidence of the impact of a low-protein diet in the management of uraemia and its complications in patients with CKD. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) and other sources for controlled trials on CKD to compare clinical management of CKD patients under various levels of dietary protein intake or to compare restricted protein intake with other interventions. Studies with similar patients, interventions, and outcomes were included in the meta-analyses. RESULTS: We identified 16 controlled trials of low-protein diet in CKD that met the stringent qualification criteria including having 30 or more participants. Compared with diets with protein intake of >0.8 g/kg/day, diets with restricted protein intake (<0.8 g/kg/day) were associated with higher serum bicarbonate levels, lower phosphorus levels, lower azotemia, lower rates of progression to end-stage renal disease, and a trend towards lower rates of all-cause death. In addition, very-low-protein diets (protein intake <0.4 g/kg/day) were associated with greater preservation of kidney function and reduction in the rate of progression to end-stage renal disease. Safety and adherence to a low-protein diet was not inferior to a normal protein diet, and there was no difference in the rate of malnutrition or protein-energy wasting. CONCLUSIONS: In this pooled analysis of moderate-size controlled trials, a low-protein diet appears to enhance the conservative management of non-dialysis-dependent CKD and may be considered as a potential option for CKD patients who wish to avoid or defer dialysis initiation and to slow down the progression of CKD, while the risk of protein-energy wasting and cachexia remains minimal.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of milk production is of utmost relevance for pediatricians and scientists interested in early life nutrition. The weight-suckle-weight (WSW) method, which consists of weighing babies before and after they suckle their mother, uses the difference in body weight as an estimate of milk intake. However, this is prone to many sources of error. In the current study, we used for the first time the water turnover method and compartmental analysis with deuterated water (D2O) as a non-toxic tracer to quantify in vivo milk production in a rat model. We assessed the effect of a nutritional intervention presumed to affect milk production, a maternal dietary protein restriction during gestation and lactation, which results in the birth of pups with intrauterine growth restriction. The specific aim of this study was to determine milk production with the body water turnover method in rat dams receiving during gestation and lactation, either a control diet (NP) or an iso-caloric low-protein diet (LP). In NP dams, mass of dam's total body water, output flow constant from dam to litter (K21) and median milk flow, calculated between days 11 to 14 after pup birth, were 282.1 g, 0.0122 h-1 and 3.30 g/h for NP dams, respectively. Maternal dietary protein restriction (-59%) during perinatal period led to a 34% reduction in milk flow (NP versus LP). With the WSW method, milk flow varied from 1.96 g/h to 2.37 g/h between days 11 to 14 for NP dams. The main advantage of the D20 method compared to the WSW method stems from its higher precision, as attested by the narrowest range of measured values of milk flow ([2.90; 3.75] and [0.98; 6.85] g/h, respectively) for NP group. This method could be suitable for testing the effectiveness of candidate galactologue molecules presumed to enhance milk production in the lactating rat model.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease; current guidelines recommend treatment with alkali if bicarbonate levels are lower than 22 mMol/L. In fact, recent studies have shown that an early administration of alkali reduces progression of CKD. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of fruit and vegetables to reduce the acid load in CKD. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in 146 patients who received sodium bicarbonate. Of these, 54 patients assumed very low-protein diet (VLPD) and 92 were controls (ratio 1:2). We calculated every three months the potential renal acid load (PRAL) and the net endogenous acid production (NEAP), inversely correlated with serum bicarbonate levels and representing the non-volatile acid load derived from nutrition. Un-paired T-test and Chi-square test were used to assess differences between study groups at baseline and study completion. Two-tailed probability values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no statistical differences between the two groups regarding systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), protein and phosphate intake, urinary sodium, potassium, phosphate and urea nitrogen, NEAP, and PRAL. VLPD patients showed at 6 and 12 months a significant reduction of SBP (p < 0.0001), DBP (p < 0.001), plasma urea (p < 0.0001) protein intake (p < 0.0001), calcemia (p < 0.0001), phosphatemia (p < 0.0001), phosphate intake (p < 0.0001), urinary sodium (p < 0.0001), urinary potassium (p < 0.002), and urinary phosphate (p < 0.0001). NEAP and PRAL were significantly reduced in VLPD during follow-up. CONCLUSION: VLPD reduces intake of acids; nutritional therapy of CKD, that has always taken into consideration a lower protein, salt, and phosphate intake, should be adopted to correct metabolic acidosis, an important target in the treatment of CKD patients. We provide useful indications regarding acid load of food and drinks-the \"acid load dietary traffic light\".",

Since FGF21 production is regulated by various nutritional factors, we analyze the impact of low protein intake on circulating levels of this growth hormone in mice and in a sub cohort of the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial. We also describe the role of hepatic FGF21 in metabolic adaptation to a low-protein diet (LPD). METHODS AND RESULTS: We fed control and liver-specific Fgf21 knockout (LFgf21KO) mice a LPD. This diet increased FGF21 production by inducing its overexpression in liver, and this correlated with a body weight decrease without changes in food intake. The LPD also caused FGF21-dependent browning in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), as indicated by an increase in the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In a subgroup of 78 individuals from the PREDIMED trial, we observed an inverse correlation between protein intake and circulating FGF21 levels. CONCLUSION: Our results reinforce the involvement of FGF21 in coordinating energy homeostasis under a range of nutritional conditions. Moreover, here we describe an approach to increase the endogenous production of FGF21, which if demonstrated functional in humans, could generate a treatment for obesity.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to be 8-16% worldwide, and it is increasing. CKD is a risk factor for heart attack and stroke, and it can progress to kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation. Recently, diabetic nephropathy has become the most common cause of CKD. In Japan, the cumulative probability of requiring hemodialysis by the age 80 years is 1/50 in males and 1/100 in females. The number of patients under hemodialysis in Japan exceeded 320,000 in 2014, among which 38,000 were newcomers and 27,000 died.The annual medical costs of hemodialysis are 1.25 trillion yen in Japan, representing 4% of the total national medical expenditures in 2014. A low-protein diet (less than 0.5 g/kg b.wt.) is a very effective intervention. Low-protein rice (1/10 to 1/25 of the normal protein contents) is helpful to control the consumption of proteins, decreasing at the same time the intake of potassium and phosphate.Protein restriction is indicated as soon as the eGFR becomes lower than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface, in order, to slow disease progression. The newly developed low-protein Indica rice is expected to help many CKD patients in China and Southeast Asia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem and more so in India. With limited availability and high cost of therapy, barely 10 % of patients with incident end stage renal disease (ESRD) cases get treatment in India. Therefore, all possible efforts should be made to retard progression of CKD. This article reviews the role of low protein diet (LPD) in management of CKD subjects and suggests how to apply it in clinical practice. DISCUSSION: The role of LPD in retarding progression of CKD is well established in animal experimental studies. However, its role in human subjects with CKD is perceived to be controversial based on the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) study. We believe that beneficial effect of LPD could not be appreciated due to shorter duration of follow-up in the MDRD study. Had the study been continued longer, it may have been possible to appreciate beneficial effect of LPD. It is our contention that in all cases of CKD that are slowly progressive, LPD can significantly retard progression of CKD and delay the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). To be able to apply LPD for a long period, it is important to prescribe LPD at earlier stages (1,2,3) of CKD and not at late stage as recommended by KDIGO guidelines. Many clinicians are concerned about worsening nutritional status and hence reluctant to prescribe LPD. This actually is true for patients with advanced CKD in whom there is spontaneous decrease in calorie and protein intake. In our experience, nutritional status of patients in early stages (1,2,3) of CKD is as good as that of healthy subjects. Prescribing LPD at an early stage is unlikely to worsen status. The role of LPD in retarding progression of CKD is well established in animal experimental studies. Even in human subjects, there is enough evidence to suggest that LPD retards progression of CKD in carefully selected subjects. It should be prescribed to those with good appetite, good nutritional status and a slowly progressive CKD at an early stage (stage 1,2,3). It may also be prescribed at stage 4 & 5 of CKD if the appetite and nutritional status are good.",

      "abstract": "Initiation of thrice-weekly hemodialysis often results in a rapid loss of residual kidney function (RKF) including reduction in urine output. Preserving RKF longer is associated with better outcomes including greater survival in dialysis patients. An alternative approach aimed at preserving RKF is an incremental transition with less frequent hemodialysis sessions at the beginning with gradual increase in hemodialysis frequency over months. In addition to favorable clinical and economic implications, an incremental transition would also enhance a less stressful adaptation of the patient to dialysis therapy. The current guidelines provide only limited recommendations for incremental hemodialysis approach, whereas the potential role of nutritional management of newly transitioned hemodialysis patients is largely overlooked. We have reviewed previous reports and case studies of once-weekly hemodialysis treatment combined with low-protein, low-phosphorus, and normal-to-high-energy diet especially for nondialysis days, whereas on dialysis days, high protein can be provided. Such an adaptive dietary regimen may elicit more favorable outcomes including better preserved RKF, lower β2-microglobulin levels, improved phosphorus control, and lower doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Clinical and nutritional status and RKF should be closely monitored throughout the transition to once and then twice-weekly regimen and eventually thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Further studies are needed to verify the long-term safety and implications of this approach to dialysis transition.",

Many authors consider a low educational level and illiteracy to be adverse features for a good dietary compliance. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 77-year old woman, illiterate, affected by advanced CKD (stage 4 according to KDIGO guidelines). She was initially ashamed of her problem and did not declare it, leading to an overzealous reduction in protein intake. However, with her daughter's help, who translated the dietary prescription into images, she overcame the barrier represented by illiteracy and was able to correctly follow the prescriptions, attaining good kidney function stability and preserving an adequate nutritional status. CONCLUSIONS: The case underlines the importance of a personalized approach to dietary prescriptions and suggests that it is possible to achieve a good compliance to the dietary treatment of CKD also in patients with relevant cultural barriers."

      "abstract": "A pilot clinical trial based on nutritional modulation was designed to assess the efficacy of a one-year low-protein diet in activating autophagy in skeletal muscle of patients affected by COL6/collagen VI-related myopathies. Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy are rare inherited muscle disorders caused by mutations of COL6 genes and for which no cure is yet available. Studies in col6 null mice revealed that myofiber degeneration involves autophagy defects and that forced activation of autophagy results in the amelioration of muscle pathology. Seven adult patients affected by COL6 myopathies underwent a controlled low-protein diet for 12 mo and we evaluated the presence of autophagosomes and the mRNA and protein levels for BECN1/Beclin 1 and MAP1LC3B/LC3B in muscle biopsies and blood leukocytes. Safety measures were assessed, including muscle strength, motor and respiratory function, and metabolic parameters. After one y of low-protein diet, autophagic markers were increased in skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes of patients. The treatment was safe as shown by preservation of lean:fat percentage of body composition, muscle strength and function. Moreover, the decreased incidence of myofiber apoptosis indicated benefits in muscle homeostasis, and the metabolic changes pointed at improved mitochondrial function. These data provide evidence that a low-protein diet is able to activate autophagy and is safe and tolerable in patients with COL6 myopathies, pointing at autophagy activation as a potential target for therapeutic applications. In addition, our findings indicate that blood leukocytes are a promising noninvasive tool for monitoring autophagy activation in patients.",

Currently, a low-protein diet (LPD) is one of the tools most used in renal conservative therapy but a possible risk connected to LPD is protein-energy wasting. The aim of this study is evaluate the possible correlation between LPD and malnutrition onset. We enrolled 41 CKD patients, stages IIIb/IV according to K-DIGO guidelines, who followed for 6 weeks a diet with controlled protein intake (recommended dietary allowance 0.7 g per kilogram Ideal Body Weight per day of protein). Our patients showed a significant decrease of serum albumin values after 6 weeks of LDP (T2) compared with baseline values (T0) (P=0.039), whereas C-reactive protein increased significantly (T0 versus T2; P=0.131). From body composition analysis, a significant impairment of fat-free mass percentage at the end of the study was demonstrated (T0 versus T2; P=0.0489), probably related to total body water increase. The muscular mass, body cell mass and body cell mass index are significantly decreased after 6 weeks of LDP (T2). The phase angle is significantly reduced at the end of the study compared with basal values (T0 versus T2; P=0.0001, and T1 versus T2; P=0.0015). This study indicated that LPD slows down the progression of kidney disease but worsens patients' nutritional state."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an emerging health public problem in Brazil. Nutritional counseling with focus on protein restriction is a promising strategy to treatment of nondialysis CKD patients due its effects on slowing renal loss. However, Brazilian people have high protein intake, which is a challenge when low protein diet (LPD) should be prescribed. This review describes a practical approach to the dietetic management of nondialysis CKD patients in Brazil. DISCUSSION: Although Brazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, Brazil has current trends of incorporating Western dietary habits, including high intake of red meat. Traditional plant-based foods, such as rice and beans, are also important contributors to the high protein content to the Brazilian diet. Thus, a successful implementation of LPD requires adaptation of these dietary habits, with reduction of portion sizes and adequate food substitution options. Intensive nutritional counseling with specialized renal dietitians is also important to improve compliance to the LPD. Moreover, the precarious health system organization and economic problems are barriers to nutritional care, which could be solved with intensive and specialized perspectives of treatment. The adherence to protein restriction is important for better metabolic and clinical control of nondialysis CKD patients. Early dietetic attention, nutrition education strategies and intensive specialized nutritional counseling are essential to achieve diet habits that promote adherence to the LPD without excluding cultural characteristics of the Brazilian diet.",

      "abstract": "Whereas in many parts of the world a low protein diet (LPD, 0.6-0.8 g/kg/day) is routinely prescribed for the management of patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD), this practice is infrequent in North America. The historical underpinnings related to LPD in the USA including the non-conclusive results of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study may have played a role. Overall trends to initiate dialysis earlier in the course of CKD in the US allowed less time for LPD prescription. The usual dietary intake in the US includes high dietary protein content, which is in sharp contradistinction to that of a LPD. The fear of engendering or worsening protein-energy wasting may be an important handicap as suggested by a pilot survey of US nephrologists; nevertheless, there is also potential interest and enthusiasm in gaining further insight regarding LPD's utility in both research and in practice. Racial/ethnic disparities in the US and patients' adherence are additional challenges. Adherence should be monitored by well-trained dietitians by means of both dietary assessment techniques and 24-h urine collections to estimate dietary protein intake using urinary urea nitrogen (UUN). While keto-analogues are not currently available in the USA, there are other oral nutritional supplements for the provision of high-biologic-value proteins along with dietary energy intake of 30-35 Cal/kg/day available. Different treatment strategies related to dietary intake may help circumvent the protein- energy wasting apprehension and offer novel conservative approaches for CKD management in North America.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research in cats has shown that increased fermentation-derived propionic acid and its metabolites can be used as alternative substrates for gluconeogenesis, thus sparing amino acids for other purposes. This amino acid sparing effect could be of particular interest in patients with kidney or liver disease, where this could reduce the kidneys'/liver's burden of N-waste removal. Since dogs are known to have a different metabolism than the obligatory carnivorous cat, the main objective of this study was to assess the possibility of altering amino acid metabolism through intestinal fermentation in healthy dogs. This was studied by supplementing a low-protein diet with fermentable fibres, hereby providing an initial model for future studies in dogs suffering from renal/liver disease. RESULTS: Eight healthy dogs were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: sugar beet pulp and guar gum mix (SF: soluble fibre, estimated to mainly stimulate propionic acid production) or cellulose (IF: insoluble fibre). Treatments were incorporated into a low-protein (17 %) extruded dry diet in amounts to obtain similar total dietary fibre (TDF) contents for both diets (9.4 % and 8.2 % for the SF and IF diet, respectively) and were tested in a 4-week crossover feeding trial. Apparent faecal nitrogen digestibility and post-prandial fermentation metabolites in faeces and plasma were evaluated. Dogs fed the SF diet showed significantly higher faecal excretion of acetic and propionic acid, resulting in a higher total SCFA excretion compared to IF. SF affected the three to six-hour postprandial plasma acylcarnitine profile by significantly increasing AUC of acetyl-, propionyl-, butyryl- + isobutyryl-, 3-OH-butyryl-, 3-OH-isovaleryl- and malonyl-L-carnitine. Moreover, the amino acid plasma profile at that time was modified as leucine + isoleucine concentrations were significantly increased by SF, and a similar trend for phenylalanine and tyrosine's AUC was found. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that guar gum and sugar beet pulp supplementation diminishes postprandial use of amino acids favoring instead the use of short-chain fatty acids as substrate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Further research is warranted to investigate the amino acid sparing effect of fermentable fibres in dogs with kidney/liver disease.",

We aimed to investigate the renoprotective effects of an LPD and the underlying molecular mechanism in a rat model of type 2 diabetes and obesity. METHODS: Diabetic male Wistar fatty (fa/fa) rats (WFRs) were treated with a standard diet (23.84% protein) or an LPD (5.77% protein) for 20 weeks from 24 weeks of age. We investigated the effect of the LPD on renal function, fibrosis, tubular cell damage, inflammation, mitochondrial morphology of proximal tubular cells (PTCs), apoptosis, autophagy and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). RESULTS: Kidney weight, albuminuria, excretion of urinary liver-type fatty acid binding protein, levels of plasma cystatin C and changes in renal histology, including fibrosis, tubular cell damage and inflammation, were aggravated in WFRs compared with non-diabetic Wistar lean rats (WLRs). Fragmented and swelling mitochondria accumulated in PTCs and apoptosis were enhanced in the kidney of WFRs. Immunohistochemical staining of p62 and p-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6RP) in the tubular lesions of WFRs was increased compared with WLRs. The LPD intervention clearly ameliorated damage as shown by the assessment of renal function and histology, particularly tubulointerstitial damage in diabetic kidneys. Additionally, the 5.77% LPD, but not the 11.46% LPD, significantly suppressed p-S6RP levels and increased microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II levels in the renal cortex. The LPD intervention partially decreased HbA1c levels in WFRs, and no differences in mean BP were observed among any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A very-low-protein diet improved advanced diabetic renal injuries, including tubulointerstitial damage, by restoring autophagy through the suppression of the mTORC1 pathway.",

METHODS: 63 patients with CKD stages 3-4, mainly with glomerulonephritis (GN), were divided into 3 groups: 1 gr--31 patients (53.3 ± 3.1 years old; M/F--18/13), LPD with prescription of ketoanalogues of amino acids; 2 gr--22 patients (54.9 3.2 years old; M/F--13/9) traditional LPD without ketoanalogues; 3 gr--10 patients (51.7 ± 4.2 years old; M/F--6/4) with natural course of CKD. Group 4 (control)--30 healthy subjects (52.3 ± 2.2 years old; M/F--16/14). The following parameters were studied: dynamics of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), hemoglobin levels (Hb), daily proteinuria, and basic parameters of protein, lipid and phosphate- calcium metabolism. RESULTS: The rate of decline in GFR was significantly lower in patients of the first group (-0.78 mL/min/year) than those of the second group (-4.9 ml/min/year). 9.7% of patients of the first group needed the start of renal replacement therapy at the end of the observation, 18.1%--of the second group and 40%--of the third. All patients who received renoprotective therapy, including low-protein diet with KA/AA reached target levels of blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg. Patients of this group was able to achieve a significant reduction in proteinuria, improvement of lipid metabolism, prevent of reduction of Hb and the development of metabolic disorders of protein and calcium-phosphate metabolism. The second group of patients, following nephroprotection recommendations and LPD without KA/AA, had fewer reductions in BP without reaching the target level, DBP did not change; reduction of proteinuria was less significant than in group 1. There was no negative dynamics of protein and calcium-phosphate metabolism, though significantly increased levels of total cholesterol and LHD were observed. The third group of patients, who did not follow the renoprotection recommendations demonstrated negative dynamics of the studied parameters. CONCLUSION: Renoprotection based on the use KA/AA in patients with CKD stages 3-4 proved to be more effective than without it in slowing the rate of decline in GFR, hypertension correction, proteinuria reduction, maintaining the level of Hb, prevention of disorders of protein and calcium-phosphate metabolism, as well as correction of the lipid metabolism.",

The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The most relevant for urine protein producing was prealbumin (r=0.924, P<0.05). The differences of blood urea nitrogen, potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, 24-hour urea nitrogen, urine specific gravity, urine protein, and hemoglobin in six months in the individualized low-protein diet group were significantly better than those in the normal low protein-diet group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Individualized low-protein diet intervention may have definite curative effectiveness in CKD patients. It can markedly improve the patients' condition,slow down the deterio-ration of renal function,and increase serum prealbumin levels that may reduce the generation of urine protein. It is worthy of wider clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Ketoacids (KA) are known to preserve muscle mass among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a low-protein diet (LPD). The present study was to compare the effects of KA supplemented diet therapy in autophagy and inflammation in CKD rats' skeletal muscle. Rats with 5/6 nephrectomy were randomly divided into three groups and fed with either 11 g/kg/day protein [normal-protein diet (NPD)], 3 g/kg/day protein (LPD) or 3 g/kg/day protein which including 5% protein plus 1% KA (LPD + KA) for 24 weeks. Sham-operated rats with NPD intake were used as control. LPD could improve body weight, gastrocnemius muscle mass, as well as gastrocnemius muscle cross-sectional area, with the effect being more obvious in the LPD + KA group. The autophagy marker LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3), p62, Parkin and PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) were significantly attenuate in LPD + KA group than LPD group. LPD + KA group had the lower total mtDNA (mitochondiral DNA) and cytosol mtDNA, NACHT-PYD-containing protein 3 (NALP3) inflammasome than LPD group, but its reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase-1 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) level was higher. Immunoblotting showed IL-1β (interleukin-1-beta) was lower in LPD and LPD + KA group than the NPD group, but IL-18 showed no significant difference among control and CKD group; toll-like receptor signalling-dependent IL-6 was higher in LPD + KA group than LPD group, but tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was not significantly changed between LPD + KA and LPD group. Systematic changes of the four cytokines were different from that of the tissue. Although LPD + KA could further ameliorate-activated autophagy than LPD, its effect on the activated inflammation state in CKD was not distinctly. Further study is still required to explore the method of ameliorating inflammation to provide new therapeutic approaches for CKD protein energy wasting (PEW).",
